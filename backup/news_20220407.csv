The Galaxy Digital CEO who was recently at the Bitcoin 2022 conference held in Miami had spoken in favor of the cryptocurrency once more, highlighting the future potential of the digital asset. Novogratz gave his prediction speaking at the conference but this is not the first time that the billionaire would be making such a prediction. Pushing Bitcoin To $500,000 Novogratz who put bitcoin at $500,000 in the next half-decade had shared thoughts behind this prediction. One of those had been the economy and the growing inflation rates that have been plaguing it. The Federal Reserve had been working non-stop with increasing interest rates and stuff but the billionaire notes that once the Fed begins to take a pause from all of this, then the digital asset would resume its upward movement.

42395615,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyDaE,1649371362,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Set to Close Week Underperforming Major Japan, China Stocks","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether were roughly flat over the past 24 hours.  Insights: Bitcoin has been underperforming major Asian stock indices amid investors' concerns about interest rate hikes and uncertain macroeconomic conditions.  Technician's take: Range-bound price action could persist for a few days.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,544 -0.3%  Ether (ETH): $3,227 +0.7%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC +10.0% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM +2.4% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC +1.9% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Bitcoin BTC −0.5% Currency Litecoin LTC −0.4% Currency Bitcoin Cash BCH −0.4% Currency  Bitcoin did a little better on Thursday after tumbling the previous day but still fell slightly, following a downward trend for much of the week. Ether fared slightly better, but other major altcoins were mixed.  Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, was recently trading at about $43,500, about where it stood 24 hours earlier and well off the $47,000 threshold it crossed a week ago as investors continued to digest the U.S. central bank's new hawkish intensity and the ongoing swirl of economic events stemming increasingly from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  ""Bitcoin is struggling for direction as Wall Street grows cautious over how aggressive the [Federal Reserve] will be with tightening of monetary policy,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Americas Edward Moya wrote in an email.  SOL and AVAX were recently up about 2% and 3%, respectively after spending parts of Thursday in the red. Terra's luna (LUNA) was recently down over 4%. The meme coins DOGE and SHIB were both roughly flat. Outside the CoinDesk top 20, CAKE rose over 6% at one point.  Crypto prices veered slightly from the performance of major equity markets, which were in the green, albeit barely. The tech-focused Nasdaq was up less than a tenth of a percentage point.  The U.S. central bank has signaled powerfully as a body, and by individual governors, over the past week that it would ratchet up its efforts to tame inflation, which has reached nearly 8%, a four-decade high.  On Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard told reporters after a speech that the Fed would have ""to move forthrightly in order to get the policy rate up to the right level to deal with inflation that we’ve got in front of us."" His remarks followed two days after Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who had been reluctant to abandon the Fed's dovish posture of recent years, suggested the Fed might increase interest rates at a faster pace.  Other winds during the day blew more favorably for digital assets. Addressing crypto In a speech for the first time, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that a digital dollar could become a ""trusted money comparable to physical cash.""  Speaking to attendees at an American University event, Yellen highlighted the differing perceptions about crypto, saying that’s often the case with “transformative” technology. “Some proponents speak as if the technology is so radically and beneficially transformative that the government should step back completely and let innovation take its course,” she said. “On the other hand, skeptics see limited, if any, value in this technology and associated products and advocate that the government take a much more restrictive approach.”  Meanwhile, European and U.S. lawmakers who have criticized Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine were considering and pushing forward on new economic sanctions. They included a European Union ban on Russian coal and a U.S. House vote to remove Russia's favored trade status and a halt to imports of energy products.  Still, Oanda's Moya was cautiously optimistic about bitcoin's near-term performance.  ""Bitcoin has held up nicely given the recent bond market sell-off, but it could struggle if that move continues,"" he said. ""Bitcoin's long-term outlook remains bullish but if risk aversion runs wild it could be vulnerable to a drop towards the $38,000 level.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,500 +0.4%  DJIA: 34,583 +0.2%  Nasdaq: 13,897 +.06%  Gold: $1,931 +0.3%  Insights  Bitcoin set to close week underperforming major asian stock indices  Concerns over how a hawkish Fed will react to inflation, the continuing war in Ukraine and China’s COVID-19 crisis sent Asian markets tumbling this week, and bitcoin with them.  The world’s largest digital asset is set to end the week down 8%, underperforming major indices in Asia including the Nikkei 225, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, the Hang Seng index of Hong Kong-listed China Stocks, as well as the S&P 500.  Analysts have pegged uncertainty, anchored by anticipation of the latest Fed minutes, as a reason for the week-long sink. The Fed now has a mandate to tame inflation, but the question is how tolerant will it be of the economy dipping into a recession.  In February, a number of analysts who previously spoke with CoinDesk said the Fed would back off tighter monetary policy if the economy cools too much, too quickly and stocks tank. These observers believed the Fed could tolerate about a 20%-30% drop in equity prices.  At the time, the central bank seemed inclined to raise interest rates in small 0.25 increments and by just a percentage point over the rest of 2022, a “trivial” amount one analyst said, with inflation running at 7% at the time.  Now, with inflation surging closer to 8% and the macroeconomic environment increasingly uncertain because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Fed has indicated it may be more aggressive in its anti-inflation measures.  How its approach affects crypto is uncertain for the long term. For now, investors seem more risk-averse, which is bad news for bitcoin.  Bitcoin’s slump on Fed hawkishness after a brief rally was felt throughout the broader crypto ecosystem as traders who bought into tokens including DOGE and SOL, which tend to rise and fall in sync with bitcoin, got rekt in a massive liquidation wave with over $400 million lost.  With bitcoin’s continued correlation to the S&P 500, the big question on traders’ mind in Asia is what will break this trend? When will bitcoin rise again?  Galaxy’s Mike Novogratz thinks it’s all on the shoulders of the Fed. Novogratz still believes bitcoin will eventually hit $500,000 and then $1 million, but it's going to be in retreat until the Fed takes its hands off the economy when it eventually slows down.  Then, “Bitcoin goes to the moon,” Novogratz said.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Stabilizes at $43K Support; Resistance at $45K-$48K  Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing after a near-10% drop from the $48,000 resistance level earlier this week. The cryptocurrency is holding support above $43,000 and is roughly flat over the past 24 hours.  The relative strength index (RSI) on intraday charts are rising from oversold levels, which could keep short-term buyers active into the Asia trading day. On the daily chart, however, the RSI is neutral with negative momentum, suggesting range-bound price action could persist for a few more days.  BTC will need to make a decisive move above above $45,000 in order to yield upside price targets, initially toward $50,966. For now, the price recovery from the January low at $32,933 remains intact, especially given the positive momentum reading on the weekly chart.  Still, indicators on the monthly chart suggest upside is limited for BTC over the intermediate term. That means BTC will need to maintain stronger support above $37,560 to keep the three-month uptrend of higher price lows stable. A decisive break below that level could invalidate the recovery phase.  The chart below shows key levels to manage short-term risk, per the DeMARK indicators, available on Symbolik.

42395609,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyDSM,1649369405,FDIC Asks All Banks to Report Crypto Activities,"A top U.S. banking regulator has asked banks to report on their “crypto-related activities,” citing potential “safety and soundness risks as well as financial stability concerns” resulting from exposure to crypto assets.  On Thursday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a financial institution letter – a letter sent to CEOs of FDIC-insured banks – requesting that banks should notify their regional FDIC director of their crypto activities. This request applies to both current and future crypto-related activities.  According to the letter, the FDIC will review the information, ask more questions if necessary, and then issue “relevant supervisory feedback.”  The new reporting requirements are a step up from previous FDIC statements on crypto.  Under Acting Chair Martin Gruenberg, the banking regulator has issued warnings about the potential for the “rapid introduction of … digital asset products into the financial system” to pose systemic risks. In February, Gruenberg said the FDIC and other regulators needed to provide “robust guidance” to the banking industry on how to manage the risks posed by crypto.  Thursday’s letter is a signal that the banking regulator is now getting serious about cracking down on crypto.  Because the vast majority of banks – including every national bank – in the U.S. are FDIC-insured, the new requirements mean that nearly all banks with crypto exposure – including Wall Street titans like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs – must now disclose their crypto activities to the regulator.  The FDIC isn’t the only banking regulator turning its eye towards crypto-related banking activity.

42395601,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyDKU,1649365440,Jack Mallers’ Strike Announces Shopify Integration for Bitcoin Lightning Payments,"MIAMI — Strike CEO Jack Mallers unveiled a litany of high-powered partnerships for Bitcoin’s Lightning Network at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami on Thursday – including an integration with ecommerce giant Shopify.  “You’re gonna be able to walk into” millions of American storefronts that plug into the payments stalwarts and pay across the Lightning Network.  Mallers said Strike partnered with NCR (NCR), the world’s largest point-of-sale (POS) supplier, and payments firm Blackhawk.  Speaking before a packed house at the Miami Beach Conference Center main stage, Mallers, an ardent bitcoiner and Lightning Network advocate, said his “King’s Gambit” would bring Bitcoin back to its payments roots.  “If we can help make the Bitcoin network more accessible and usable we believe we can change the world,” he said. Leveraging Bitcoin as a cheap payments network is critical to that, he said, contrasting it with the “caviar-eating” history of boomer bank-issued credit cards that he said hasn’t innovated (beyond onboarding middlemen and their fees) in years.  “There’s not been since 1949 a superior payments network that allows us to innovate” for consumers, he claimed. “Let’s build the superior payments network from scratch.”  His lead-up laced in sarcasm, Mallers’ payoff was simple: Bitcoin’s Lightning Network “carries all the properties” for homegrown success.  He said Strike would partner with Shopify’s global network of merchants to allow for payments across the Bitcoin Lightning network – for those merchants who want to opt in.  “Strike’s integration enables Shopify merchants to diversify their existing payment options and reach untapped global markets and purchasing power. Strike’s integration also allows Shopify merchants to generate savings through low-cost payment processing. By instantly converting bitcoin (BTC) payments to dollars, Strike removes certain complexities merchants face in holding bitcoin,” a press release said.  Maller’s announcement could supercharge an explosion in mainstream adoption for Lightning Network. Earlier Tuesday, stock and crypto trading hub Robinhood Markets (HOOD) said its new wallet would add support for bitcoin transactions on the Lightning Network.  “This is about America and we need to protect our ability to innovate,” Mallers said.  “I’ve also been working with policymakers to ensure that we have the right to build freely in this country,” he said, adding he has been working with Wyoming’s bitcoin-loving Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R) on such legislation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/07/jack-mallers-strike-announces-shopify-integration-for-bitcoin-lightning-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46bec6616bc63967bed8b59b7f6a532202b0b009-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The emergence of cryptocurrencies kick-started a digital revolution that has transformed many areas of modern life. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a part of hese ventures that have enjoyed success, especially in the last few months. In general, the year 2022 was heralded as the year of the NFT.

42395636,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyGi3,1649362641,"Market Wrap: Cryptos Recover, With Altcoins in the Lead","Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies stabilized on Thursday as some buyers returned from the sidelines.  Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) took the lead, especially WAVES, which bounced back with a 6% return over the past 24 hours. BTC and ether (ETH) were roughly flat on Thursday, compared with a 4% rise in Pancake Swap's CAKE token and a 3% rise in AAVE over the same period.  Just launched! Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why.  On the regulatory front, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that a digital dollar could become a ""trusted money comparable to physical cash,"" in her first speech on digital assets on Thursday. Yellen did not give a personal take on the crypto industry, although she acknowledged viewpoints from both proponents and skeptics of digital asset technology, and stressed the importance of assessing risks to the financial system.  Elsewhere, the S&P 500 traded higher on Thursday along with gold and the U.S. dollar.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $43,410, −0.93%    ●Ether (ETH): $3,220, −0.24%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,500, +0.43%    ●Gold: $1,935 per troy ounce, +0.86%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.65%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin's spot trading volume across exchanges declined on Thursday, according to CoinDesk data, which could indicate low conviction among traders despite the current stabilization in price.  In the bitcoin futures market, however, there was a slight uptick in short liquidations and a rise in buy volume versus sell volume over the past 24 hours, suggesting moderate bullish sentiment among short-term traders.  Miners ready to accumulate?  The chart below plots moving averages based on bitcoin's mining difficulty, which is the estimated number of hashes (computational power) required to mine and process transactions on the blockchain.  As new coins are mined into existence, miners sell some of their coins to pay for production costs, which results in bearish pricing pressure, according to Glassnode, a crypto data provider. By contrast, after miners capitulate and price stabilizes, an accumulation phase begins based on the expectation of higher prices.  In theory, other market participants would step in to achieve a ""fair price"" or an equilibrium following extreme peaks and troughs in a given cycle.  By averaging mining difficulty, traders can determine when miner selling and buying pressure aligns with turning points in BTC's price. Bearish signals occur when short-term moving averages compress and cross below a long-term moving average, and the opposite is true for bullish signals. Still, at times signals can lag price action by a few months.  For a deeper look at fundamental factors that influence price, see here for an analysis by David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional.  Altcoin roundup  TitanSwap’s token soared after listing on Bithumb and KuCoin: The decentralized exchange (DEX) TitanSwap’s native token TITAN surged by 101.79% in the past 24 hours after South Korea’s Bithumb digital marketplace announced its listing. The announcement of its listing on KuCoin on April 5 also boosted the value of the coin by 300%, but TITAN sank drastically to the negative realm in the past two days. The token is now trading around its average price in the past month, but way below its record high value of $0.029 in August.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, however, shifted the focus of the debate to whether the crypto industry provides enough safeguards against money laundering and other financial crimes. At present, there are 18,162 cryptocurrencies in operation, 460 cryptocurrency exchanges, and a total market capitalization of just under $2 trillion. In this crypto ecosystem, over $91 billion worth of crypto is traded with the majority of transactions involving Ethereum or Bitcoin. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies promise relatively anonymous cross-border transactions free from state oversight and unencumbered by the formalities of the conventional banking system. Ordinarily, cryptocurrencies inspire talk of privacy, freedom, and community. Russia was hit by a raft of financial sanctions which effectively blocked a large part of its access to the US Dollar-backed global financial system but some experts have raised concerns that crypto currencies might give an avenue to Russians to preserve their wealth.

42411826,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDcZ,1649359793,"Crypto Token Supply: What’s the Difference Between Maximum, Circulating and Total Supply?","The major innovation of blockchain technology is that it provides an authoritative, immutable and transparent record of transactions and data and is most commonly used to record ownership of units of cryptocurrency.  Understanding a cryptocurrency’s supply – how many coins percolate around an economy – is crucial for determining metrics like supply, demand and market capitalization. Indeed, one of the reasons that coins like bitcoin (BTC) – the native cryptocurrency of the Bitcoin network – are worth anything at all is that you know precisely how many of them are in circulation at any given moment.  However, things get slightly confusing when wading a little deeper. The circulating supply is not the same as the maximum or total supply, and distinguishing between the three terms is critical to understanding the size of a cryptocurrency’s economy.  What is a circulating supply?  A cryptocurrency’s circulating supply defines how many units of that cryptocurrency are swirling around the market at any one time. As of this writing, there are around 18.98 million BTC, 120 million ethereum (ETH) and 81 billion tether (USDT) coins in circulation, for example.  Note that circulating supply does not refer to all of the units of that cryptocurrency that you can buy on a crypto exchange – just the cryptocurrency that’s out there on the blockchain today and can be freely sent between wallets.  For instance, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, controls billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, but hasn’t touched them in over a decade. Nevertheless, these Bitcoins are still considered to be part of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.  This consideration has caused some analysts to dismiss one of the most commonly referred to metrics that define a crypto economy’s size: market capitalization.  The market cap of a coin is a very crude multiplication of all the coins in existence by the price, even if many of those coins are lost, sequestered by the FBI or owned by the deceased. One metric, known as the realized market cap, tries to get around this issue by only counting recently moved coins in its calculation.  What is a total supply?  A cryptocurrency’s total supply is the total number of tokens that exist on the blockchain, including tokens that aren’t in public circulation.  When a cryptocurrency project launches a new token or coin, they might create lots more crypto than they distribute at that moment.  For instance, coins earmarked for staking rewards – those given to people who lock up tokens within a protocol – might technically “exist” on the blockchain, but you might not be able to start earning them until a certain condition has been met or date has been passed.  That’s to say, they’re minted, but they’ve never hit anyone’s wallet and aren’t in circulation. They might have been created following a “premine” – when a developer mines lots of coins before launching the blockchain, but doesn’t distribute them to anyone – or could be subject to a vesting period.  The total supply doesn’t include coins that have been burned. This refers to tokens that have been permanently removed from circulation by being sent to a wallet to which nobody has the key.  Maximum supply  The maximum supply of a coin or token refers to the total number of coins that can ever be minted. Bitcoin’s maximum supply is capped at 21 million. Due to a feature built in to Bitcoin’s code, once the number of coins in circulation reaches 21 million, no more can ever be “mined” – generated as a reward for discovering new Bitcoin blocks.  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  Some coins do not have maximum supplies. Ethereum is one such example; right now, there is no upper limit on how many ETH can exist, although only roughly 18 million ETH can be minted each year based on the current block discovery times and rewards.  The supply of some cryptocurrencies fluctuates, making maximum supplies hard to quantify. LUNA, for instance, is created and burned to keep the price of UST, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin issued on the Terra ecosystem, equal to $1. While Ethereum now burns a portion of coins sent as a transaction fee instead of handing it all to miners, following the implementation of EIP-1559 in August 2021.  Which is the most important metric?  It’s difficult to say whether total, circulating or maximum supply is the most important – each has its own use. However, knowing the differences among them can help you wade through the crypto market and understand how they can influence the price of a coin.  One key metric is the fully diluted market cap – a multiplication of a token’s maximum supply by its current price. It includes vested tokens and can provide hints that some market actors, like early investors or the project’s team, could sell a whole lot of tokens on the open market once they have access to the coin.

In a cool-off, the coin may drop towards the $16 to $18 support zone, which flashes with a crucial Fibonacci retracement level. Past Performance NEO is down 22 percent from March 2022 peaks at spot rates. In a bear breakout formation, evident in the daily chart, the coin is under intense selling pressure. So far, bears have reversed gains posted in the last weeks of Q1 2022. NEO Technical Analysis As per the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the path of least resistance is southwards.

Going forward, the immediate bear target will be $16—flashing with March 2022 lows. What to Expect from NEO? Sellers are squarely in control at spot rates. From the daily chart, the coin is at around the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the Q1 2022 trade range.

And who wouldn&apos;t be tempted by an innovation that may render the entire banking system invalid? The problem is that the interest is not always positive. Nefarious activities have also been attracted by the high privacy allowed by blockchain. As such, it was only a matter of time before the authorities came knocking. And in the USA, they came banging at the door in the form of SEC lawsuits. Are such activities good for crypto? Read on to find out. Why the High SEC Interest Recently? First things first, one may be wondering why the high SEC interest? Why have there been very few lawsuits in the first half of blockchain&apos;s existence compared to the latter? Well, there are some key causative factors; Authorities are Playing Catch-up in Regulations Blockchain is a very recent invention, just a little over a decade old bitcoin. Even more outstanding is how rapidly it is evolving. For instance, blockchain is firmly considered the cornerstone of web 3.0 development. Given this rapid rate of change may just be scratching the surface of what&apos;s possible with blockchain. And there lies the problem for authorities.

The cryptocurrency is holding support above $43,000 and is roughly flat over the past 24 hours.  The relative strength index (RSI) on intraday charts are rising from oversold levels, which could keep short-term buyers active into the Asia trading day. On the daily chart, however, the RSI is neutral with negative momentum, suggesting range-bound price action could persist for a few more days.  BTC will need to make a decisive move above above $45,000 in order to yield upside price targets, initially toward $50,966. For now, the price recovery from the January low at $32,933 remains intact, especially given the positive momentum reading on the weekly chart.  Still, indicators on the monthly chart suggest upside is limited for BTC over the intermediate term. That means BTC will need to maintain stronger support above $37,560 to keep the three-month uptrend of higher price lows stable.

42395637,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyGf6,1649354665,Michael Saylor: Biden’s Executive Order Akin to POTUS Giving ‘Green Light to Bitcoin’,"MIAMI — MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor and ARK CEO Cathie Wood gave a number of reasons for why they think bitcoin (BTC) will continue to gain adoption and increase in price in a chat at the Bitcoin 2022 conference here on Thursday.  ­­­­­­­­Speaking to a packed house of the bitcoin faithful, who gave the pair a standing ovation at their introduction, Saylor and Wood laid out several political and technological reasons for their optimism about the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market value.  On the political front, Saylor, whose company owns roughly $6 billion worth of bitcoin, said President Joe Biden’s recent executive order directing various federal agencies to coordinate their approach to regulating the sector amounted to the “president of the United States giving a green light to bitcoin.”  “If I scan the last 100 years of history [and ask] when was the last time the president of the United States directed the government to embrace a new asset class, the answer is never,” Saylor said. He described the order as Biden telling different U.S. agencies to “get educated on bitcoin and figure out how to get it incorporated into the government.”  Wood agreed that there has been growing political support for bitcoin in the U.S.  “You’re seeing the politics around bitcoin changing radically because it has become the single issue that some people are voting on, and this is becoming bipartisan,” said Wood, who envisions bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2030.  Wood did sound one note of political caution, however, pointing to China’s strong support of blockchain several years ago, only to eventually ban much of the activity around it in favor of its own central bank digital currency (CBDC).  “I don’t hear talk about that here and haven’t heard much talk about ‘hey, this is going to displace the dollar as the reserve currency of the world,’” said Wood. “That’s very good we’re not hearing that kind of rhetoric here. But I’m sure as the elections evolve, someone will raise that as an issue.”  Praise for the Lightning Network  As for the technological forces driving adoption, Saylor and Wood pointed to the growing number of platforms integrating the Lightning Network as improving bitcoin’s usefulness as a medium of exchange.  “I think every crypto exchange, if they’re going to remain viable and competitive, they need to build Lightning into their exchange,” said Saylor, citing Kraken and Cash App’s recent announcements about incorporating the Lightning Network. (Shortly after Saylor and Wood's talk, popular no-fee trading app Robinhood (HOOD) announced in Miami that it, too, was integrating with Lightning.)  Wood was similarly sanguine about the rapidly growing payments technology.  “I think we’ll see an explosion of developers focused on Lightning Network,” said Wood. “This will be the missing link in terms of use case. Store of value – it’s always been there [for bitcoin]. But means of exchange and unit of account now have much a better opportunity for bitcoin to dominate long term.”  Saylor said he thinks bitcoin’s real potential will be realized when billions of people around the world have a mobile phone and an app with a Lightning wallet, and that wallet has some bitcoin on it as a store of value, and some U.S. dollars or digital euros or Chinese digital yuans on it as a medium of exchange.  “Then you’ll see tens of trillions or hundreds of trillions of dollars all moving on Lightning rails secured [on] the Bitcoin network,” said Saylor. “That’s when people will wake up and realize, holy crap, this really is going to change the world.”  Read more: Robinhood Releases Crypto Wallet to 2M Users, Plans Integration With Bitcoin Lightning Network",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nelson Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/07/michael-saylor-bidens-executive-order-akin-to-potus-giving-greenlight-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02ced0ac03afc78c6620734e73ca809223d3b620-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

LFG purchased $100 million worth of AVAX tokens using its UST stablecoin in an over-the-counter (OTC) trade with the Avalanche Foundation, according to a spokesperson from Ava Labs.  Additionally, TFL, the company supporting development of the Terra blockchain, has executed a $100 million LUNA to AVAX token swap to “strategically align ecosystem incentives,” according to a Terra tweet.  The Avalanche Foundation now holds $100 million worth of UST and $100 million worth of LUNA after the two deals.  LFG beyond just BTC  LFG has been on a crypto buying spree of late, adding over $1.6 billion of bitcoin to its treasury reserves to back Terra’s UST stablecoin.

42395624,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyGVG,1649352485,"Robinhood Releases Crypto Wallet to 2M Users, Plans Integration With Bitcoin Lightning Network","MIAMI — Robinhood Markets (HOOD) said Thursday it has activated its crypto wallet for 2 million “eligible” customers, making digital asset transfers broadly possible in the long-firewalled investments app.  Chief Product Officer Aparna Chennapragada made the announcement on stage at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami.  Only a handful of wallet beta testers could move bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), dogecoin (DOGE) and a handful of other traded coins in and out of Robinhood’s walled garden before. Now, all waitlisted customers outside of regulatory no-go zones Nevada, New York and Hawaii can do so.  Additionally, she said Robinhood will add support for bitcoin transactions on the Lightning Network, the speedy, low-cost settlement layer for Bitcoin.  “For the larger community this is a fantastic way” to access bitcoin cheaply and in a green way, she said, adding that BTC is the top recurring buy on the app.  HOOD’s crypto push  First teased in September, Robinhood’s crypto wallet eschews advanced features like self-custody. “Corporate wallets” control customers’ private keys, a FAQ page read; it said those who want to be their own bank can move their digital assets elsewhere.  That won’t likely matter to the troves of day traders who got their first taste of the crypto markets betting on Robinhood-held DOGE. They can now spend and send those meme coins – perhaps on Dallas Mavericks basketball tickets or a Tesla-branded belt buckle.  Nearly 10 million Robinhood users swapped coins early last year in one sign of the app’s crypto appeal, the company has said. Robinhood’s almost three-year-old crypto trading functionally has produced an explosion of revenue, last quarter generating $48 million for the publicly traded firm.  “Wallets are just the first step we’re taking to connect our customers to the broader crypto ecosystem,” CEO Vlad Tenev said in a press statement.  Read more: Robinhood Shares Slump as Crypto Trading Weakness Continues  Limitations  Still, Robinhood’s multi-asset wallet falls short of true functionality. It cannot plug into Ethereum-based services as MetaMask does. It cannot accept ERC-20 tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFT) or any asset outside of Robinhood’s trading list. Tokens generated by airdrops and forks won’t work either.  “Any NFTs sent to a Robinhood Ethereum address may be lost and unrecoverable,” the FAQ page said.  Staking also appears to be off-limits for now. Tenev has previously acknowledged customers’ desire for the yield-earning feature and said during last quarter’s earnings call that Robinhood was investing in the necessary tech. A staking service would have to be “compliant,” he said.  Users won’t be charged for moving their Robinhood-based crypto into wallets that have such abilities.

42395639,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyGj2,1649348034,First Mover Americas: Spot ETF Speculation Grips Bitcoin Market,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: The U.S. SEC's decision to approve the Teucrium futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) filed under the Securities Act of 1933 renews hopes for a spot-based ETF. Some experts remain skeptical.  Chartist's Corner: Bitcoin sees a bull cross.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Fred Thiel, CEO, Marathon Digital Holdings  Francis Suarez, mayor of Miami  John Bartleman, president and CEO, TradeStation  Martin Leinweber, digital asset product strategist, MV Index Solutions  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  A day after the release of hawkish Federal Reserve minutes, the battered crypto market is reassessing prospects of U.S. regulators approving a spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  A spot-based ETF would allow investors to have exposure to bitcoin (BTC) through a regulated product without having to own the actual cryptocurrency, and is expected to boost institutional participation and bring trillions of dollars into the crypto market. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has time and again rejected spot-based bitcoin ETFs, citing a lack of market surveillance and risk of manipulation.  Some experts, however, are again hopeful, thanks to the SEC's decision to greenlight Teucrium's futures-based ETF filed under the Securities Act of 1933.  The 1933 act governing spot-based ETFs requires filing form 19B-4, detailing how the underlying asset is resistant to manipulation. Applications for the several futures-based ETFs approved since October 2021 were filed under the Investment company Act of 1940, which governs futures ETFs and doesn't require submission of Form 19B-4. Last year, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had said he favored futures-based funds over a spot bitcoin ETF, mentioning the 1940 act as appropriate for approving bitcoin futures-based instruments.  ""The SEC approves Teucrium Bitcoin Futures ETF filed in 33Act structure. All previous BTC futures ETFs were in 40Act structure,"" Bloomberg's ETF analyst Henry Jim tweeted. ""Bottom line: This increases chances of a 'spot' bitcoin ETFs being approved as it would only be able to use the 33Act structure.""  In a tweet thread, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said that ""if the SEC is comfortable with a bitcoin futures ETF, they must also be comfortable with a spot Bitcoin ETF. And they can no longer justifiably cite the '40 Act as being the differentiating factor.""  Sonnenshein argued that the SEC, while approving Teucrium's application under the 1933 Act, defined the underlying market as being restricted to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)-listed bitcoin futures. However, the CME futures are influenced by the unregulated spot market. So, the regulator can no longer deny spot-based ETFs, stating they are exposed to abuse. Grayscale's parent company Digital Currency Group is also the owner of CoinDesk, which is run as an independent subsidiary with an editorial firewall. Grayscale has applied to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot-based ETF.  However, some observers are skeptical because overseeing the spot market, still dominated by whales, or large investors, on offshore exchanges remains a challenge.  ""The SEC will continue to reject a spot ETF as their main reason is manipulation on unregulated spot crypto exchange that they cannot oversee,"" Laurent Kssis, managing director and head of Europe at crypto exchange-traded fund firm Hashdex, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. Kssis has long held a belief that regulators would stay away from spot-based products while the cash market is unregulated.  ""The CME is regulated and so they fulfill their obligations to the market and objectives to oversee regulated financial markets irrespective of underlying constituent contract,"" Kssis added.  Jad Comair, founder and CIO of French ETF provider Melanion Capital, said, ""The exchanges where bitcoin trades are less regulated than traditional financial exchanges, and this remains will remain an issue for regulators.""  However, regulation may be coming soon and that could keep hopes of a spot-based ETF alive, perhaps helping the market absorb shocks from Fed's aggressive monetary policy tightening.  ""With [U.S. President Joe] Biden’s executive order, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Europe’s MiCA announcements and proposals, everything indicates that regulation will improve to a certain point where regulators will be confident approving crypto’s eligibility in retail products, like ETFs,"" Comair noted. ""At Melanion, we share Kevin O’Leary’s vision [Wednesday] at the Bitcoin Conference [in Miami], that bitcoin is now a sector. Therefore, we have solved the bitcoin ETF quest by qualifying and weighting Equities that represent most of the bitcoin sector.""

Specifically, the tax would come into effect when digital tokens like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) are sold or exchanged, the release read. The effective tax rate, which is part of the government&apos;s post-COVID recovery initiative, would be sub 5%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD -1.1%) is slipping to $43.3K in midday trading and ethereum (ETH-USD -0.5%) is edging down to $3.2K.

The Sveriges Riksbank published a request for information seeking information about what's available and how the architecture might work ahead of a potential decision on issuing its currency in digital form.  Pilot trials carried out by the Swedish authorities have used distributed ledger technology, similar to that underpinning bitcoin (BTC). In a report Wednesday the Riksbank said it wanted to explore issues like smart payments, for example, enabling transactions to be made as soon as a contract is fulfilled.  The central bank said it wants to ""gain a concrete understanding of possible suppliers and technical options"" that could underpin a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to be used within five or six years. It also wants to check limitations of different solutions and how they fit with the rest of the market.  The tender is open until May 13, after which a small number will be invited in to demonstrate their ideas, the central bank said.

The U.K.'s financial services regulator said closing down companies that fail to meet basic regulatory standards will protect consumers from potential fraud, poor treatment and create a better market.  The U.K. announced on Monday it plans to create a crypto regulatory package and to bring stablecoins into the payments system. In its business plan released Thursday, the FCA said it will contribute to developing the crypto policies and will consider its regime for stablecoins used as payments.  The agency is one of many regulators worldwide with responsibility for crypto companies, and the announcement comes days after the Temporary Registration Regime, which allowed them to operate in the U.K. without full registration, ended. The firms had until April 1 to obtain full registration, though a select few have been permitted to continue with temporary registration.  ""This leads to questions being raised about whether these companies will be able to continue operating in the U.K. market, and what happens to consumer crypto assets currently held by consumers with these companies,"" Emma McInnes, the global head of financial services at research company YouGov, said in an interview, adding:  ""We have already seen some companies moving their crypto services operations from the U.K. to other markets to ensure they can continue offering crypto services to Britons but from outside of the new U.K. regulatory regime.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | RESEARCH,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/07/fca-to-add-80-people-in-crackdown-on-problem-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6db8cd206ec3786ffaf00fd353af905e9c39f27-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395623,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyGTI,1649343767,Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Calls Crypto 'Transformative' in Wide-Ranging Speech,"A digital dollar could become a ""trusted money comparable to physical cash,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in her first speech on digital assets on Thursday.  Speaking to attendees at an American University event, Yellen highlighted the extreme divergence of perceptions about crypto, saying that’s often the case with “transformative” technology.  “Some proponents speak as if the technology is so radically and beneficially transformative that the government should step back completely and let innovation take its course,” she said. “On the other hand, skeptics see limited, if any, value in this technology and associated products and advocate that the government take a much more restrictive approach.”  She focused part of her speech on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), an area of interest for U.S. policymakers over the past few years.  ""The development of our currency to its current form has been a dynamic process that took place over centuries. Today, monetary sovereignty and uniform currency have brought clear benefits for economic growth and stability. Our approach to digital assets must be guided by the appreciation of those benefits,"" Yellen said. ""Some have suggested a CBDC could be the next evolution in our currency. A recent report by the Federal Reserve opened a public dialogue about CBDCs and the potential benefits and risks that could be associated with issuing one in the U.S.""  Any potential CBDC design would have to address its impact on the financial system, ability to address financial crime and national security questions, privacy implications, ability to address macro policy and how it might interact with existing fiat currencies, stablecoins or other CBDCs, Yellen said.  Pointing to U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order on digital assets, Yellen said any potential CBDC would have to support the dollar's role in international markets.  ""I don't yet know the conclusions we will reach, but we must be clear that issuing a CBDC would likely present a major design and engineering challenge that would require years of development, not months. So, I share the president's urgency in pulling forward research to understand the challenges and opportunities a CBDC could present to American interests,"" she said.  Yellen highlighted five lessons she believes apply to Treasury's work on digital assets through her speech: the financial system ""benefits from responsible innovation,"" the potential harms to vulnerable individuals if regulation does not keep up with innovation, rules should focus on activities and their risks rather than technologies specifically, the U.S. benefits from the dollar's current role and regulators should work with industry in supporting responsible innovation.  The Treasury secretary pointed to specific concerns around the existing crypto market, such as runs on stablecoins. She referenced last year's Iron Finance run, when its TITAN token fell in price, which led to its IRON stablecoin losing its peg to the U.S. dollar.  ""This is not hypothetical. A stablecoin run occurred in June 2021, when a sharp drop in the price of the assets used to back a stablecoin set off a negative feedback loop of stablecoin redemptions and further price declines,"" she said.

42394242,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvafyN,1649342982,How the Play-to-Earn Industry Can Rebuild Better After the Ronin Attack,"In feudal Japan, the term ronin was used to describe a Japanese samurai without a master. Left alone due to the death of his lord, or loss of his privilege, a ronin was a warrior adrift, roaming at large, free from the constraints of loyalty. Expressed by two characters that literally mean floating and man, the term in Japanese culture invokes a sense of tragedy and failure, a disgraced entity at the edge of society. Today, the Japanese use it to describe students who failed their college entrance exam and must try again, living masterless until they pass.  This is where the Ronin blockchain gets its name. Built and owned by the Vietnamese game development studio, Sky Mavis, Ronin is a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum designed specifically to overcome the scaling challenges experienced by the developer's first blockchain game, Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis founder Trung Nguyễn created it after the original Ethereum scaling application Axie was built on, the Loom network, abandoned the gaming sector to focus on enterprise blockchain instead.  Leah Callon-Butler is a CoinDesk columnist and director of Emfarsis Consulting.  See also: How to Pick the Right Play-to-Earn Game for You  What Nguyễn and his team built was a robust sidechain, which has proven itself independent and impenetrable thus far. Unlike the traditional trope, however, Nguyễn’s Ronin could never completely go it alone, as its users still need to be able to interact with other blockchains. As such, it was the “bridge” that connects Ronin to the main Ethereum network that was exploited for 173,600 ether (ETH) and 25.5 million USDC worth over $625 million in total at the time of the attack last month, one of the largest crypto heists to date.  While the attack was obviously a direct hit on Sky Mavis, its broader implications demonstrate how these floating protocols are actually deeply connected through common membership to the decentralized ecosystem and the universal need for interoperability. If they respond in solidarity, this crisis may be reframed as an opportunity for the community to rebuild better together.  See also: Thousands of Ether From Ronin Exploit Moved to Tornado  “I was shocked and sad but then immediately became calm because it’s the only way to get through this effectively,” Nguyễn told me over Discord, when I asked about his immediate reaction to the hack. Since then, the company has announced a $150 million funding round led by Binance that – combined with Sky Mavis' balance sheet funds – will be used to reimburse all users affected by the Ronin Validator Hack. That kind of emergency funding must be a huge relief to a founder at the center of one of the biggest blockchain-based burglaries in history, but even before he had that guarantee, Nguyễn maintained his composure.  “We plan carefully, over-communicate and solve one thing at a time; each of us needs to be the person others can emotionally and logically rely on,” said Nguyễn. I got to know him pretty well last December, when I profiled him for CoinDesk’s Most Influential series of 2021, and can say that this response is the deeply analytical, process-driven Nguyễn to a tee.  Through removing emotions and “over communicating every single step” to each other, Nguyễn said his colleagues are able to feel a greater sense of control and become a source of reliability for others. From there, a sense of assurance amplifies throughout the team, he said.  In spite of all the recent challenges, Sky Mavis is still forging ahead with the launch of its new game, Origin, which is an evolution of their first release. The mood in the Vietnam office right now is one of stoic resolve, Nguyễn told me.  “We were hesitant that we wouldn't have enough resources to support the Origin launch and scalability,” Nguyễn admitted. “However we trust both the incident and Origin teams to handle whatever issues may arise,” he said. Some might say Nguyễn has nearly impossible standards; he has taken years to build an all-star team that he feels he can trust and rely on.  After the hack was announced, my Twitter feed lit up. Plenty of obvious backers came out to demonstrate their support for Axie’s core team, but it was Axie’s competitors that truly set the tone. Corey Wilton, creator of the popular blockchain game Pegaxy, tweeted that he felt “very very sad” and acknowledged the immense pressure upon the Sky Mavis team.  Robbie Ferguson, co-founder of Immutable X, a layer 2 scaling product for Ethereum that competes with Ronin in the blockchain gaming sector, tweeted that his thoughts were “also with Axie” and said he was confident they would recover from the crisis.  Kieran Warwick, co-founder of the upcoming game, Illuvium, which is built on Immutable X, has been a particularly vocal critic of Axie Infinity in the past. But upon news of the hack, he dropped his competitive streak to show comradery instead. “Competition is great, but nobody likes to see something like this happen,” he tweeted.  See also: Sky Mavis reims $150M Round Led by Binance  This is a stark contrast to recent times, when the Axie FUD has sometimes been deafening. Along with the spectacular crash of SLP, Axie’s in-game reward token, from an all-time high of just over $0.39 in July 2021, to a low of $0.015 in March 2022, we’ve witnessed the general sentiment for play-to-earn gaming turn from dizzyingly sensationalist to deeply scrutinous.  Likewise, the news headlines turned from proclamations of poverty alleviation and economic empowerment to questions of ethics and exploitation.  Today, there are more than 398 blockchain games being played worldwide, and $5.4 billion in funding has poured into the space, led by heavyweight VCs, including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia. The sector has gone from niche to normie, with the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA) reporting a 186% growth in its membership base between 2020 and 2021. The industry organization now boasts over 473 members, including gaming studios, blockchain protocols and individuals within the community, but pre-Axie times, there were very, very few interested in the intersection between blockchain and gaming.  An entire new industry has formed around the Axie phenomenon. Even the game’s scholarship model – where players can rent their Axie creatures out to others – was once revolutionary, demonstrating the most interesting use case the world had ever seen in terms of the utility of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Now, the feature is basically standard across all blockchain games and underpins the entire concept of decentralized gaming guilds, a new business model that acts as an on-ramp for Web 3 newcomers who don’t own their own NFTs.  While these guilds now represent hundreds of NFT games and blockchain-based virtual worlds, all of them began with Axie.  See also: To Improve Crypto Gaming, Developers Should Look Back in Time | Opinion  The Ronin exploit shows that even rivals can and should put aside their differences in times of crisis. While competition fuels innovation and serves to advance the adoption of Web 3, so might solidarity. A security breach isn’t good for anyone, and a hack of this proportion stains the entire industry, which could cause would-be players, partners and investors to stay away.  Particularly as this definitely will not be the last exploit; a hack like this could happen to any of us, at any time. It is a shared fear and responsibility for us all. Some forward-thinking VCs have stepped up to aid Sky Mavis this time, but it will take more than money to ensure the future of Web 3 is safe and secure. Through genuine collaboration, sharing of information, lending support and demonstrating confidence in fellow builders – the industry can and will survive.  See also: Ronin Attack Shows Cross-Chain Crypto Is a 'Bridge' Too Far | Opinion  In this way, all of us in Web 3 are ronins. While the ronin was without a lord, he was never alone. The ronin banded together, skirting traditional hierarchies of social organization to form a decentralized, leaderless collective of their own. Like-minded loners who failed to fit with conventional expectations, opting to create their own shared spaces at the fringes of society instead. On their own, the ronin were vulnerable, but together, they became much greater than the sum of their parts. Together, they – and we in Web 3 – will be stronger than before.

Bitcoin Roundups lets users round up payments to the nearest dollar to buy bitcoin with the difference.  Lightning Network (LN) Receives enables users to receive bitcoin in Cash App through the Lightning Network. The ability to send bitcoin through that network was enabled in January.  Cash App is also providing support for URIs, or Unified QRs that are enabled by BIP 21.

42395634,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyGg5,1649339928,"Bitcoin Regains $43.5K as 'Fear' Hits Sentiment, Though Some Remain Bullish","Bitcoin showed signs of recovery following Wednesday’s slide as hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve failed to temper investor fears about inflation in the coming months.  Bitcoin (BTC) broke below a recent uptrend, price charts show, failing to breach the $48,000 level this week. The asset could fall to as low as $42,000, where strong support seems to exist.  Minutes from the Fed's March meeting, released Wednesday, showed the U.S. central bank planned to shrink its balance sheet by up to $95 billion each month, or upward of a trillion dollars over this financial year, as it seeks to combat inflation. Markets slid following the release, with bitcoin dropping below support at $45,000.  But global stocks and indices showed a nominal recovery on Thursday. Europe’s Stoxx 600 rose 0.46% and Germany’s DAX rose 0.43%, while futures of the U.S.'s S&P 500 rose 0.15%. The recovery carried over to crypto markets, which showed signs of stabilizing as bitcoin and ether bounced from Wednesday’s lows.  In a 24-hour period, however, most cryptocurrencies remained in the red. Dogecoin’s DOGE carried the biggest losses among majors as it fell 11%, followed by Cardano’s ADA at 8%. Data showed the crypto market lost some 5% overall, sliding to a $1.9 trillion capitalization from Tuesday’s $2.4 trillion mark at one point.  Meanwhile, the website Alternative.me's Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which reflects investor sentiment, flashed a “fear” reading to reach its lowest value in over two weeks.  However, some analysts pointed to recent on-chain data and investor behavior suggesting overall sentiment around bitcoin purchases remained bullish.  “The number of bitcoins on exchanges has fallen to the lowest since August 2018,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. “Investors have been withdrawing coins since the beginning of March, which is often taken as a signal to keep Bitcoin out of the market for a long time.”  “This reduction in active supply often pushes the price up,” Kuptsikevich added.  Johnny Lyu, CEO of crypto exchange KuCoin, stated such market activity was able to buoy bitcoin’s drop.  “Positive market sentiment and the bullish trend did not allow Bitcoin to drop significantly,"" Lyu said in a Telegram message. ""This indicates great levels of investor support and the likelihood of growth for the cryptocurrency market in the short term.”  “Bitcoin is now influenced by numerous factors, both macro and micro. Therefore, many crypto investors have taken a wait-and-see approach, which is evidenced by a decrease in purchase volumes and an increase in withdrawals to third-party wallets,” he added.  Some others said the drop was a necessary correction following weeks of an uptrend.  “The drop is at best tagged as a necessary correction as all fundamentals antagonize the drop on all metrics,” stated Dmitry Mishunin, founder of security and analytics company HashEx, in an email to CoinDesk.  “Bitcoin has continued to see a massive accumulation from both corporate buyers and whales,” Mishunin commented, pointing out business analytics firm MicroStrategy’s recent bitcoin purchase.  ""Another fundamental that antagonizes the current selloff is the fact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the Teucrium ETF application,” he said.",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/07/bitcoin-regains-435k-as-fear-hits-sentiment-though-some-remain-bullish,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d7165c1980ca951086bea7bcd4284fe22c9357c-1300x694.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Digital Currency Group – CoinDesk's parent company – Mirana Ventures, SIG, Ethereal Ventures and CMT Digital, the crypto division of trading firm CMT Group, also participated in the round.  Improbable describes itself as a provider of technology and services to support multiplayer virtual worlds to more than 60 global game publishers. Its large scale simulation platform also supports the U.K.'s defense mission.  ""Giving people the tools to design their own metaverses at the scale that Improbable enables, with Web 3 interoperability and composability to expand on each other’s creations, will result in some truly groundbreaking virtual experiences,” said Chris Dixon, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in the press release.  Despite the projected revenue growth of metaverse industries, the products available to customers today cannot support enough people or ""rich interactivity"" to ""fulfil the metaverse's promise,"" said Improbable. Others are closed platforms that don't match users' expectations of ""sophisticated interoperability and shared governance,"" the company noted in the release.  M² will use Improbable's Morpheus Technology, which can support over 10,000 players and enables their interaction in dense virtual spaces, according to the press release. The network will also allow trade in digital assets and Web 3-style governance.  ""M² introduces a way for game devs to create virtual assets and add them to the network,"" and will enable interoperability in between metaverses, Marine Boulot, vice president of public relations and communications at Improbable, told CoinDesk.  Improbable, which has raised more than $600 million in previous funding rounds, announced in January plans to accelerate its push into the metaverse and refocus its content strategy.

LOVO, creator of voice non-fungible tokens (NFTs) derived from artificial intelligence, has closed a $2 million extension led by crypto venture firm Hashed. The capital brought the total pre-Series A funding round up to $6.5 million.  “With this funding, we want to extend the voice-first universe and essentially become the voice of Web 3,” LOVO CEO Charlie Choi said in an interview with CoinDesk.  The new round also involved PKO Investments, a crypto investment syndicate that brought a group of angel investors, including Yat Siu, founder of Hong Kong-based online game and venture capital company Animoca Brands, and Matt Finick, the former chief financial officer of online gaming platform Roblox and Marvel Studios.  “We believe that LOVO will collaborate with many blockchain gaming and metaverse projects by introducing voice NFTs to their communities for personalizing their identities in the virtual world in a more advanced way,” Simon Kim, Hashed CEO and managing partner, told CoinDesk in a statement. “TTS (text-to-speech) technology will open up a new era for metaverse projects with real-time translation, active [non-playable character] interaction and exclusive user experiences by communicating with other users and influencers.”  In January, LOVO launched and quickly sold out a collection of 8,888 Voiceverse NFTs. Each NFT contained a unique voice created from a seed of 100 real recordings licensed from voice actors, who continue to receive royalties each time an NFT is sold. The AI voice model in the NFT can be used to produce any type of speech content or for real-time communication in chat applications like Discord.  Choi, the LOVO CEO, said he views voice NFTs as an in-game item, similar to how characters can change the clothing of their avatar now. While voice changers have existed in gaming circles for years, LOVO offers a more human-sounding, unique alternative.  “We want to be ahead of the curve,” Choi explained. “I think we are a little bit early in terms of market readiness, but we want to partner with as many of these communities as possible, because our goal is to provide billions of voices if there are billions of virtual identities that are being built.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/07/hashed-leads-65m-round-for-lovos-ai-backed-voice-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3e8f9f11a773e8d7913ecb4c826f21b2f0d10bd-5065x3377.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Do We Really Know What That Means for Crypto?,"April showers are falling, the spring flowers are blooming once more, and the deadline to file 2021 tax returns is just around the corner – but this year, many Americans are facing more complicated tax questions than ever before.  Blame for the complicated tax picture can be spread around. For example, COVID-19 tax breaks and stimulus payments had tax implications of their own, and work from home and remote work mean that more of us are working multiple jobs with a more complicated income picture.  Yet some of the blame has to be placed on the surging popularity of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies that use those assets to generate income – and on the lack of clarity on how such assets and income should be treated for tax purposes.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.  Looking for guidance  “The biggest issue is how little IRS guidance there is out there,” said Nancy Dollar, a tax attorney with Hanson Bridget, a diversified law firm and family office. “You can list on one hand what they’ve put out; most of it is extremely vague and doesn’t address a lot of crucial issues.”  Hanson Bridget has experienced a steady increase in clients with crypto tax questions, Dollar said, many of them early investors in digital assets, and the firm generally renders advice in line with guidance from the Internal Revenue Service that treats cryptocurrency as property.  Many clients come to Hanson Bridget having engaged in various investment solutions completely absent of guidance and without an understanding of the implications of the IRS’s treatment of digital assets, said Dollar.  “When you deal in crypto, you recognize a gain or loss on the disposition of that property, it’s not like spending currency,” Dollar said. “In foreign currency, you don’t have to recognize a gain if you use that currency to buy a cup of coffee, but in crypto you do.”  In part, the vagueness and confusion in IRS guidance is likely by design, Dollar said, as much of the agency’s documentation was written to try to prevent taxpayers from using cryptocurrencies in tax-deferred 1031 exchanges, which are used for real property.  “That guidance went through every type of crypto widely available at the time and discussed how bitcoin was different from ether, which was different from litecoin and Ripple, analyzing all of these types of crypto to make its point that these weren’t like-kind properties, so you couldn’t sue a tax-deferred exchange,” Dollar said. “But in doing that, they showed they were willing to engage on the unique characteristics of each cryptocurrency, and people are now taking that ball and running with it.”  A court case hangs in the balance – maybe  Many questions would be answered by a decision in what has come to be known as “the Jarrett Case.”  Joshua and Jessica Jarrett were involved in staking on the Tezos network in 2019 and received about $9,407 worth of Tezos tokens that they didn't sell or exchange that year. On their initial 2019 tax return (filed in 2020), the Jarretts reported those tokens as “other income” but filed an amended return later in the year taking the position that the tokens weren't income in 2019 because they weren't disposed of in that year, claiming a refund of nearly $3,300.  After the IRS didn’t issue a refund or respond to the Jarretts’ request, they filed a complaint last year in district court requesting their refund. At issue was whether tokens created and earned through staking should be considered income in the year in which they are created.  “The baker analogy is the most quoted in our world – you don’t tax the baker when they bake the cake, you tax them when they sell it,” David Sacarelos, a CPA at the accounting firm Seiler LLP, said.  “The theory at work here is that proof-of-stake coins are either the creation of property or the receipt of property,"" he said. ""Are they capital and some labor, or does the baker analogy mean the coins are inventory and if you sold them they are taxed as ordinary income and not capital gains? The IRS needs to decide if this is potentially the return of capital or something like that.”  Read more from CoinDesk’s Tax Week coverage.  Should earnings from staking or mining cryptocurrency be taxed at the point at which they are received, or when they are disposed of? It may take longer than expected to find out. In February, the IRS capitulated and sent the Jarrett’s their tax refund, with interest.  While the Jarretts have tried to reject the refund and request a decision in the matter, the IRS filed for a dismissal of the case at the beginning of March.  “It carries huge consequences for anyone engaging in mining or staking activities,” Dollar said. “If the IRS position is that it’s all taxable income at the time of creation, you’re currently taxed on any token rewards as they are earned before you dispose of them. Proponents of crypto take issue with that, even if you don’t buy the taxpayer-created property argument, a lot of these tokens are functioning in an inflationary environment where in staking there’s dilution when people create tokens, it’s more akin to a stock split – the units increase, the value technically decreases.”  Work with what you have  So what certainty can clients have in the vague world of crypto taxation, aside from the inevitability of governments finding ways to derive revenue from digital assets?  “It’s still safe to say we’re in a rising-rate environment; the capital gains rate has been discussed as a potential source of additional income, and this is not a situation where we would expect tax rates to go down,” Sacarelos said. “Maybe this is a year that we look at our crypto investment assets and consider whether it is time to realize some of those gains and diversify.”  There are also opportunities for proactive estate tax planning with digital assets, Dollar said.  “In terms of planning, this is a very volatile environment,” Dollar said. “One opportunity I see for those who have significant enough wealth to do tax planning around their estate plan is to consider using crypto in what are called grantor-retained annuity trust (GRAT). These are estate-planning vehicles that allow for the transfer of wealth and operate very favorably when you have a highly volatile asset.”  In a GRAT, the grantor puts assets into the trust and receives regular income payments in the form of an annuity stream, while the assets are allowed to appreciate and transfer to heirs with little or no estate taxes levied.  In the meantime, don’t expect a lot of additional information from the IRS, Sacarelos said.  “The IRS is under pressure because of declining service levels; they’re hoping to catch up from 10 million past tax returns and 18 million unprocessed pieces of paper before the end of this calendar year, but they’re so backed up right now,” he said. “They’re doing the best they can, but if we’re looking for clarification or meaningful reform from the ground up, I don’t know if that’s possible right now.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/07/its-tax-time-again-do-we-really-know-what-that-means-for-crypto,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42411821,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDPL,1649335800,Emerging DeFi Technology Trends to Watch,"As an advisor learns about decentralized finance (DeFi), it’s important to learn about the emerging technology also found in the industry. Emerging DeFi technology and services are unique to cryptocurrency, as some of these products and services simply are not possible without blockchain technology. This is an entirely new asset class, and advisors must be educated on these topics and able to clearly help their clients when faced with financial planning decisions. Clients will rely on advisors as they attempt to navigate this space, and advisors must be able to guide them down the best path.  In the first three parts of this series, we’ve covered the basics of DeFi, including its importance in the overall crypto economy, what decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are, and the technology behind them.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.  Read the first, second and third parts of this series on understanding DeFi.  What are crypto bridges?  One of the more difficult aspects of investing in cryptocurrency is navigating the many different blockchains that exist in the crypto economy. Coins and tokens native to one blockchain are not able to be used on another blockchain. For example, you cannot use Ether or ERC-20 tokens on any other chain besides the Ethereum chain.  This presents a problem because often investors see an opportunity on a new blockchain and therefore need a mechanism to send value (coins or tokens) from one chain to another. Crypto bridges allow a user to send value from one blockchain to another chain, such as from Ethereum to Terra. These bridges power the transfer of assets and information cross-chain, allowing users to have access to new chains and the decentralized apps (dapps) on the new chain.  There are two types of crypto bridges: trusted bridges and trustless bridges. Trusted bridges are centralized by design – that is, they require users to trust a central party for custody and transactions. Trustless bridges operate using smart contracts and trading algorithms and do not require users to trust a central entity.  It’s important to understand the risks while using crypto bridges. When using a trusted bridge, the risks are similar to when using a centralized exchange or wallet. Custodial risk is the risk users face when they allow a third party to hold their tokens and coins. When coins are held in a custodial account, the user is also susceptible to censorship risk. Many users are comfortable with these risks, while others prefer to use trustless bridges. These bridges, on the other hand, do not require users to trust custodians or worry about censorship; they do, however, require users to trust the smart contracts that power the bridges.  The largest hacks in crypto have come from crypto bridges. This technology is new; even just a few years ago, there was not yet market demand for cross-chain bridges. Developers have been building crypto bridges quickly, and unfortunately, not all of the security vulnerabilities were found via code audits. It’s certain that the security of these bridges will improve as they become more widely used and built, but users must be very careful while using them now. It’s important to remember that bridges are an emerging technology and in their current state are not entirely free from risk.  Understanding self-repaying loans  One of the most interesting features of digital money is the ability to create new technology and use cases for blockchain technology. Self-repaying loans are one of the most innovative new ideas found in DeFi.  Essentially, when a user takes out a self-repaying loan, they are using yield on a deposit to pay for a loan they’ve taken against that deposit. In order to take out a self-repaying loan, a user first deposits capital into a protocol like Alchemix, which allows you to borrow up to 50% of your deposit instantly. This is possible because of the high yields found in crypto lending. The 50% of the deposit that stays in the protocol is used to pay back the 50% that was taken as a loan. As the principal pays back the borrowed money, the rate at which the loan is paid back accelerates.  To understand this, let’s walk through an example. A user holds DAI, a stablecoin, in their MetaMask wallet. The user connects their MetaMask wallet to Alchemix. The user deposits DAI into Alchemix via the website and can immediately borrow up to 50% of the deposited funds via the alUSD (Alchemix stablecoin). The user can then sell their alUSD for fiat currency, ether or other cryptocurrencies. The DAI still held with Alchemix are left generating a yield (approximately 10-15% at current rates) and are paying down the balance of the loan. As the balance of the loan gets smaller, the balance of collateral is increasing. The interest rate is static, thus, the rate at which the balance is paid down accelerates.  Investors must trust the Alchemix smart contract when taking out a self-repaying loan. Many investors are attracted to this idea because they are able to keep their cryptocurrency, and this is a tax efficient way to borrow against an appreciated crypto position. Again, this is an emerging technology, so the security mechanisms are not perfectly vetted.  The benefits of synthetic securities  One of the fastest-growing sections of DeFi are synthetic assets. The market cap of cryptocurrencies is very small when compared to that of traditional assets. This difference led developers down the path of creating synthetic assets.  Smart-contract technology allows developers to create synthetic securities that trade on blockchains instead of via their traditional exchange network. For example, it’s possible to create a synthetic stock of a company whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.  On Terra’s Mirror Protocol, it’s possible to purchase synthetic stocks, such as Apple or Microsoft. These “synthetic stocks” are simply tokenized derivatives that track the value of an underlying security. In this case, these synthetic stocks are programmed to track the price of the actual underlying asset.  Some of the benefits of synthetic securities over traditional securities include 24/7 liquidity, borderless transfers and liquidity pool farming in synthetic security yield farming – the ability to generate yield on a position by contributing to liquidity pools.  While not yet popular and highly regulated in the United States, this trend is growing, and synthetic securities are attracting new users at a fast rate. Users enjoy trading synthetic stocks because they provide additional markets rather than just the crypto economy. One of the fastest-growing aspects of synthetic securities are synthetic funds, which are securities that track exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as S&P 500 ETFs.  Synthetic securities provide users with tremendous liquidity, borderless transfer of ownership and protection against censorship. However, like crypto bridges and self-repaying loans, this is new technology and therefore has increased smart-contract risk and rug pull risk that investors need to be aware of.  Moving forward  As these emerging technologies continue to grow, advisors should continue learning and watching the ecosystem evolve. Because cryptocurrency is programmable money, I’m certain that there will be even more innovation in the space. These technologies will continue to evolve and will certainly disrupt all aspects of financial services, creating new opportunities we can’t even imagine now.",NEUTRAL,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | DAI,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/emerging-defi-technology-trends-to-watch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22d5f90794f3113c2c54dd0b75ac147acf957482-3199x2089.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The main result for pride is raising the THETA price by 60%. Our previous forecast has been realized. Buyers were able to test a critical range of $4.3. And now the question arises, what&apos;s next? In the weekly timeframe, we see that the $4.3 test took place on a large scale. However, the body of the weekly candle is quite small. The small pin on the weekly candle is just within the critical range of $4.3. In our opinion, this is a signal of the unwillingness of sellers to take the initiative in the THETA market. https://www.tradingview.com/x/aRI3LbkI/ The new trading week on the THETA market on 7 April completely absorbed the previous achievements of buyers. Interestingly, for such a victory, sellers needed 3 times less trading volumes than when trying to break buyers&apos; range of $4.3. This means that buyer has no desire to jealously restrain the price from falling, as actively push it up. A bad sign for a stable growth trend, which indicates a great emotionality of buyers. Though, such emotionality at local highs often works the opposite way. As a result, the consolidation range of $2.3-$4.3 was formed on the weekly THETA timeframe. If buyers can&apos;t keep the $3.2 mark, then the minimum target of sellers is the lower limit of the current consolidation.

The funding will help drive the company’s expansion into Latin America and Southeast Asia.  Japanese conglomerate SoftBank launched the $5 billion fund in 2019. A $3 billion follow-up fund was launched in September.  “North America will still be our biggest market,” Chris Gonsalves, CEO of Community Gaming, told CoinDesk in an interview. “But we’re seeing the most organic growth in Latin America.”  Community Gaming is a platform that lets gamers create their own esports tournaments and gaming competitions for any game they like.

At least sellers make their presence and strength clear. The downward trend, which sellers began in May 2021, has not been reversed. The recent local growth wave, which buyers started on 7 March, stopped near the upper trend line of the falling channel. So far, buyers have not even been able to touch the critical liquidity range of $149. This range now plays a key role in shaping a new medium-term growth wave. If buyers can take it under control - the DASH growth will continue to $250. https://www.tradingview.com/x/XMV7YZu4/ However, now in the weekly timeframe, we see a disappointing situation. During the trading week on 4 April, sellers completely absorbed the weekly candle of 21 March. It is worth noting that the weekly candle of 21 March was closed on a large scale. It took sellers much less effort to completely offset the efforts of buyers. This indicates the unwillingness of buyers to keep the price in this range. In this case, the probability of the DASH wave continuing to fall to $88 is extremely high. The main problem is that the $88 mark can only be the first target on the way to the $68 global target. To fully confirm this scenario, sellers should take control of a local critical point. Which one? we will consider this in more detail on a daily timeframe.

The fund will be deployed through eToro’s new “eToro.art” platform, aiming to bring the “fun and community” of the NFT industry to its 27 million users, according to a press release Thursday.  EToro says it will be “one of the leading NFT collectors in the world” after its funds are fully deployed, with a collection that already includes NFTs from projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks and World of Women, among others.  “We want to participate and show we are part of the NFT community,” Guy Hirsch, eToro’s managing director of NFTs, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We also hold the view that [blue-chips] will hold long-term value.”  Read more: Arcade Launches NFT Lending Platform as Blue Chips Hold Strong  Hirsch said eToro has seen a particular interest in Bored Apes as a larger brand, and was excited to be a launch partner for its ApeCoin (APE) token last month.

EToro plans to dedicate $10 million of the fund to emerging projects through a quasi-incubator program to which up-and-coming NFT artists are encouraged to apply.

42395652,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyJg2,1649329200,"Crypto Rules Should Match Traditional Financial System, Yellen to Say Thursday","U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wants to put the crypto industry on the same level, and facing the same rules, as the traditional U.S. financial system, according to excerpts from her first speech to focus entirely on digital assets.  Yellen will make the case that finance – including the newest innovations from the crypto industry – should be subject to consistent, “tech neutral” rules that protect people “from fraud and misleading statements regardless of whether assets are stored on a balance sheet or distributed ledger.”  “Digital assets may be new, but many of the issues they present are not,” Yellen will say in her remarks, prepared for delivery Thursday at American University. “When new technologies enable new activities, products and services, financial regulations need to adjust.”  The U.S. administration has been devoting increased attention to crypto, with President Joe Biden focusing the federal government’s efforts through a wide-ranging executive order issued last month. That order forms the backbone of Yellen’s speech, which is meant as a high-level outline of Treasury’s views and next steps while getting nowhere near the weeds of referencing individual products or firms, according to Treasury officials previewing the speech.  Though lawmakers have begun launching legislative efforts to foster cryptocurrency innovations while keeping the public and financial system safe from hazards, Yellen will argue that “regulators have authorities they can use to promote these objectives and Treasury supports those efforts.”  The Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have already been active in staking out their authorities over crypto trading, but the U.S. banking regulators will also have their say as the agencies debate the best course through the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  The industry is already smarting from SEC proposals that crypto lobbyists and lawyers in Washington, D.C., think could sweep digital assets into the agency’s oversight. Meanwhile, top Republicans such as Sen. Pat Toomey have been pitching legislation that could undermine the agency’s reach, though it’s unclear whether the closely divided Congress will find enough common ground or interest to send any crypto bills to the president for his signature this year.  As the industry grows and changes at a breakneck pace, Yellen thought it was a good time to share her view, Treasury officials said – including the sentiment that regulation will be critical for crypto’s development, not an impediment. Coming from the Biden administration’s chief financial voice, her speech makes it clear that crypto has become a top priority for the federal government.  “Our regulatory frameworks should be designed to support responsible innovation while managing risks – especially those that could disrupt the financial system and economy,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/07/crypto-rules-should-match-traditional-financial-system-yellen-to-say-thursday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94dc37a49f4994f38a0cad2781f35bac8fe7562b-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The acquisition, expected to close later this year, would see the two firms power the industry's first one-click cryptocurrency checkout, Bolt announced Thursday.  Bolt, based in San Francisco, provides online checkout services and raised $355 million in January giving it an $11 billion valuation. Its one-click checkout is designed to allow its merchant clients to provide a fast and efficient user experience, similar to one that customers can experience on Amazon.  Wyre, also based in San Francisco, develops software to support blockchain-based payments. Last year it connected to the Visa network allowing users to move money between crypto and fiat currency.  The acquisition will allow Bolt's retailers to accept crypto as payment for goods and services as well allowing for the purchase of non-fungible tokens (NFT) through Bolt using Wyre's APIs, or application programming interfaces.  The integration of a crypto payment option has been in Bolt's plans for several years.  ""When I wrote the draft business plan for Bolt, I had always imagined cryptocurrency at its center,"" founder and Executive Chairman Ryan Breslow said in the statement. That was in 2015.

The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and InterPlanetary File (IPFS). It allows developers to build and publish open Application Programme Interfaces (APIs), called subgraphs. The subgraphs give easy accessibility to data in the network. Subgraphs can be composed of a global graph of all the world&apos;s public information. This data can be transformed, organized, and shared across applications for anyone to query with just a few keystrokes. Developers have used over 3000 subgraphs in developing decentralized applications (Dapps) like Uniswap, Synthetix, Aragon, AAVE, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, and Decentraland. What is the Graph (GRT)? The Graph has built an open data layer on top of blockchains: Indexers can run their own Ethereum archive nodes to run Graph Node, or they can use node operators like Infura or Alchemy. The Graph (GRT) is multichain and can be exchanged in other blockchains like Ethereum due to the implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that allows for easy interoperability, Avalanche blockchain, and Solana blockchain. It was co-founded Yaniv Tal, Brandon Ramirez, and Jannis Pohlmann. Now, we shall look at the price analysis of The Graph for the coming years.

In the beginning, all that was needed was a basic computer. The earliest bitcoin miners utilized normal multi-core CPUs to generate BTC at a pace of 50 coins per block in 2009. With a few decent computers lying around, you might have made approximately $5 per day. As a result of the low difficulty of mining (the amount of computer power required), it made sense for hobbyists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to participate. However, in less than a decade, a lot has changed. Today, if you mined 50 BTC, you&apos;d walk away with more than $23 million. That same geeky &apos;hobby&apos; would have made you several million dollars if it had traded at the current price of roughly $46,000. But things are a bit more complicated. In October 2010, the public was given access to the code for mining bitcoin using GPUs. There was a rise in the need for specialist mining hardware as the difficulty of mining increased. GPUs were able to handle the work. The technological know-how required to mine bitcoin with a single GPU was minimal. Anyone with a few hundred dollars could do it, and the computational needs were still cheap enough to make it viable. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies grew, the mining community developed several innovative concepts for new types of mining equipment.

ETPs are a popular way for institutional investors to bet on cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Banks including Goldman Sachs (GS), ICAP, JPMorgan (JPM)and UBS (UBS) have all bought ETPs for an increasing number of clients.  The Sandbox platform, built on Ethereum, is a decentralized virtual world where participants can monetize assets and gaming experiences. Through the ETP, investors will be able to capitalize on the growth of The Sandbox in a secure way, according to the press release.  In February, 21Shares launched its Decentraland ETP involving its MANA token. Hany Rashwan, CEO and co-founder of 21Shares, told CoinDesk in an email that for this ETP it chose The Sandbox over other metaverse platforms because of investor demands for more access to opportunities beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.  “The metaverse is one of the most pre-eminent themes within crypto at the moment, with [SAND] in particular showing strong growth to become the best performing blue-chip metaverse token,” said Rashwan.  The launch marks 21Shares’ 30th cryptocurrency ETP offered and will be cross-listed on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. 21Shares has close to $3 billion in Assets under Management (AUM) and has over 130 listings, including the world’s only ETP tracking Binance, according to the press release.  The launch comes after SAND, the native token of The Sandbox platform, has dropped 40% in the past three months.

Wednesday’s figures were the third-highest of 2022 following nearly a billion dollars worth of losses stemming from liquidations on Jan. 21 and $470 million on Jan. 22. Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $42,500 from $47,000 at the time.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.  Read More: What is Solana?  Futures tracking Solana’s SOL and Dogecoin’s DOGE saw a combined $40 million in liquidation losses, the most among major cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin and ether (ETH). Meanwhile, GMT tokens of the month-old crypto project StepN were an unusual entrant on the list with $9 million in recorded losses.  Both DOGE and GMT were among the top gainers in the past week. DOGE prices were buoyed amid speculation that Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s appointment to the Twitter board would be a positive catalyst for dogecoin’s growth, while Stepn gained popularity among traders for its unique step-to-earn approach.  Bitcoin futures racked up $92 million in losses, the most among all cryptocurrencies, followed by ether futures at $64 million. The losses continued in Asian hours on Thursday, with over $40 million in liquidations already recorded at writing time.  Data from tracking tool Coinglass show most liquidations took place on crypto exchange Binance, with over $133 million in losses. Traders on OKX and FTX saw the next highest losses with $100 million and $68 million respectively.

The exchange's app will now be active in the country, the firm said at an event in India's tech hub, Bengaluru. Coinbase is the world's second-largest exchange by trade volume.  Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, who has been in India over the last few weeks announced that the company is making ""a long-term investment"" in India. The firm's Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee later demonstrated user onboarding on the exchange.  The announcement comes at a time when India has announced stiff new crypto taxes. The law includes a 30% tax on profits from crypto transactions, which came into effect on April 1, and a controversial 1% tax deducted at source (TDS), which will be effective from July 1.  Armstrong acknowledged the regulatory challenge in promoting the technology to mass acceptance at a time when enthusiasm has dipped due to the new tax law. ""We know it's not going to be a straight shot to bring this technology. We don't know exactly how it's going to evolve. But we're committed to working with bank partners, regulators [and] most importantly, the Indian people because they've shown a real spark of interest in cryptocurrency, and there's a real desire to get access to some of these services and products,"" he said.  The onboarding on Coinbase would require setting up a UPI payment method. UPI (unified payments interface) is an instant real-time payment system allowing peer to peer and person to merchant transactions, which is regulated by the Indian central bank.  Armstrong said, ""India has shown a great willingness with UPI."" Chatterjee explained how setting up UPI would be the first step in buying crypto. Chatterjee also said Coinbase has ""invested over $150 million in over 10 companies in India"" including ""Polygon, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch.""

It&apos;s set apart from a regular Twitter profile picture by the distinctive hexagon surrounding it. But how could a profile picture ever be worth USD 500,000? The answer lies in the new definition of luxury. For eons, luxury has meant exclusivity, the ownership of collectibles, and the enjoyment of finer things in life — a first-class ticket to New York, a penthouse in Paris, or a brand new Van Cleef &amp; Arpels timepiece. But now, luxury has moved to the digital world, with ownership expressed through NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. In essence, an NFT denotes ownership of a one-off piece of digital property, such as artwork, trading cards, comic books, and more. This certificate of ownership is etched onto the blockchain, an indelible series of distributed ledgers that can&apos;t be compromised. Once the preserve of innovators and early adopters, NFTs have now gone mainstream, with collectors piling in to acquire ownership of digital assets, and even regular consumers dabbling regularly in NFT art. The rise of the NFT and ownership of distributed assets is inextricably linked to the movement towards a decentralised Web 3.0, coupled with the rise of cryptocurrency and Decentralised Finance (DeFi).
