42382062,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYJ7,1560209431,Michael Ford Named Newest Bitcoin Core Code Maintainer,"Long-time Bitcoin Core contributor Michael Ford, who often goes by the handle “fanquake,” has been named the newest maintainer of the open-source software project.  Ford will join the four other current Bitcoin Core maintainers -- Wladimir van Der Laan, Jonas Schnelli, Marco Falke, and Samuel Dobson — in doing the “janitorial” work that keeps the most popular version of the bitcoin node software organized and moving forward.  The decision was made at the last CoreDev meeting, an invite-only event which gathers many of the most active Bitcoin Core contributors a couple of times a year. As the developers are spread across the world and mostly chat online, this gives them some time to chat face-to-face.  Ford was nominated, as described in a transcript under the Chatham House rule (which doesn't put names to specific comments in the hopes of promoting freer discussion) written by contributor Bryan Bishop.  Ford subsequently added his key to the ""trusted keys list"" file on GitHub, giving him the ability to merge in changes that have been finalized into the codebase.  Ford said on GitHub:  ""I'll gain merge access and will continue with all triage/repo management work. I'll be focusing primarily on build system development with some guidance from [Cory Fields].""  The title of a maintainer is sometimes conflated with being a leader of a project, which really isn't what the role entails.  Nevertheless, maintainers do play an important role (across all open source projects, no less). Once a code change has been reviewed sufficiently, maintainers help to guide the process and merge in code snippets that have been reviewed sufficiently.

42382069,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYTB,1560193219,100 Bitcoin Users Perform What Might Be Largest 'CoinJoin' Transaction Ever,"The community behind the privacy-centric bitcoin app Wasabi Wallet recently brought together 100 people to collectively execute a ""CoinJoin"" transaction on bitcoin in what might be the biggest event of its kind.  Some context: bitcoin itself is far from private, as users can, via the blockchain, see where coins are being transferred to and from. One effort to afford greater privacy to transactions is CoinJoin, a long-standing technology first proposed in 2013 by long-time bitcoin idea man and cryptographer Greg Maxwell. The idea is that transactions can be made more private by jumbling a number of different transactions together and then redistributing them.  At 100 transactions, Wasabi Wallet's effort might be the biggest, but it's certainly an advancement for the privacy tech as a whole.  ""There wasn't any service created to do such large CoinJoins,"" zkSNACKS CTO Adam Fiscor told CoinDesk, which launched Wasabi Wallet last year to make CoinJoin transactions easier to use. Fiscor did add one small caveat that it's ""possible"" that Blockchain's SharedCoin has done one as large, ""but I'm not sure if it's relevant.""  As Fiscor explained to CoinDesk, the event represented ""the largest practical CoinJoin that can be done on the bitcoin network."" That's because of some of the built-in restrictions on the bitcoin network, such as the limit on the amount of data that can be included in a single transaction block), as well as the human practicalities of getting so many people to transact together at once.  ""The third caveat is that it's pretty damn hard to coordinate 100 people over the Tor network,"" Fiscor remarked.  And indeed, the transaction took a while to execute. Partially on the Wasabi Wallet reddit, the community tried unsuccessfully for a while to organize a 100 person CoinJoin, getting 94, 97, 92, and even 99 participants before reaching their round goal of 100.  The future of privacy?  Going further, Fiscor hopes this large CoinJoin transaction offers a showcase of the norm for bitcoin's use into the future.  In short, the more transactions in a CoinJoin, the more privacy you get, because with more users it becomes harder to untangle all the transactions that initially went in.  ""However, 'anonymity loves company' the more participants there are, the better your privacy is, and the faster the CoinJoin rounds are,"" the Wasabi Wallet website explains.  Getting 100 people to join together for a transaction might seem like overkill, but Fiscor sees it as the future because the more transactions in one, the more efficient it is, too.  ""In the long term bitcoin mixing will be either priced out from the blockchain or improve to be as cost efficient as possible. The more participants there are, the more cost efficiency can be gained,"" Fiscor said.  And that's especially the case with upcoming technologies that could be added to bitcoin -- if everyone agrees they should be implemented, that is.  There's ""Schnorr,"" for instance, a technology that could build in functionality into bitcoin to meld transaction signatures together.  ""For example Schnorr input signature aggregation is way more efficient with 100 people than with [two],"" Fiscor said, adding: ""Same goes for Bulletproofs. Or just simply tinkering on the optimal mix outputs given a set of inputs.""

42382079,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYaj,1560189622,Above $125: Litecoin Jumps to Highest Price in Over a Year,"Litecoin’s price hit its highest level in over a year on Monday.  The world’s fourth largest cryptocurrency as per market capitalization rose to $128.07 at 12:00 UTC on Coinbase – the highest level since May 23, 2018 – and was last seen trading at $126, representing a 10 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Notably, the recent price action suggests LTC is leading the broader market higher. The cryptocurrency is currently up more than 30 percent from the low of $97 seen on June 4.  Meanwhile, bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market value has gained just 7 percent during the same time frame.  LTC’s outperformance could be associated with the mining reward halving due in less than 60 days. On Aug. 8, the reward for mining on litecoin’s blockchain will be halved from 25 coins to 12.5 coins per block.  The cryptocurrency rallied more than 500 percent in three months before the previous reward halving, which took place on Aug. 25, 2015.  The price increased from around $1.5 in May 2015 to hit a high of $7.00 in July 2015 before falling back to $3.00 post-halving, according to historical data.  If history is a guide, LTC continues to rise over the next four weeks before witnessing a bout of profit taking ahead of the Aug. 6 event.  It is worth noting that litecoin’s non-price metrics are also witnessing solid growth. For instance, the hash rate has hit a new lifetime high of over 400 trillion hashes per second today, according to bitinfocharts.com.  Daily chart  LTC continues to chart bullish higher lows and higher highs with the major moving averages aligned in favor of the bulls - the 50-day MA is located above the 100-day MA, which is holding above the 200-day MA. All three averages are trending north, indicating a bullish setup.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) is breaking higher from the consolidation, signaling a continuation of the rally from the price low of $66 seen at the end of April.  More importantly, the indicator is well short of the high of 86.00 seen in the first week of May, meaning there is plenty of room for price rally in the weeks leading up to the reward halving.  All-in-all, LTC looks set to test the psychological resistance of $150 in the short-term. The rally to $150, however, may not happen if BTC tanks, dragging the broader market lower.  However, even in that case, LTC’s BTC-denominated exchange rate may do well. LTC/BTC is currently trading at 15,910 sats, the highest level since April 15, according to Binance data.

42382063,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYHr,1560187846,Siberian Region Partners With Universa to Create Blockchain Tourism Destination,"Universa Platform, a Russian blockchain platform intended for corporate management and state administration, has partnered with a Russian federal subject, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, to help the bucolic region join the digital economy through blockchain enabled technology, according to a company statement.  The partnership will create a pilot area for digital technologies and services which aims to make the region, located in Western Siberia, a tourism destination as well as an attractive place for foreign direct investment.  Universa’s blockchain platform will be integrated into government operations as an “investment project management service” to control budgeting and prevent misuse of funds. Tracking mechanisms will generate automatic reports when investment funds are spent, ensuring transparency, thereby making the region safer for investors.  Additionally, a multi-language communication platform will be developed to provide a single digital ecosystem to be used by the tourism industry. All industry participants -- including “suppliers of tourist products and services, transportation companies delivering the tourists, accommodation and catering facilities, small and medium enterprises providing services in adjacent areas, investors, business support foundations, and finally tourists heading for their vacations in the region” -- will contribute to a “pool of data” that will help identify problems as well as areas where the industry can expand.  According to regional authorities, over 500,000 tourists visited Ugra in 2018. These authorities hope the creation of “a center of competence” within the tourism industry will spur interest in the region.  This decision comes on the heels of President Vladimir Putin’s decree made in May 2018, “On National Goals and Strategic Development Objectives of the Russian Federation for the Period of up to 2024,” which aims to “take Russia into the top five largest economies, ensure economic growth rates exceeding international rates, while at the same time maintaining macroeconomic stability, including inflation under 4 percent.”  According to its white paper, Universa uses a contract execution machine and a distributed state ledger to “support token representation of everything from passports to boarding passes, bus tickets or taxi fares; they can be gift cards, vouchers, or gym membership cards.”  Neither the company, nor Okrug officials, responded to a request for comment.  The agreement was signed by Alexander Borodich, CEO of Universa, and Roman Genkel, General Director Ugra Development Foundation at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 7.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/10/siberian-region-partners-with-universa-to-create-blockchain-tourism-destination,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22f2b4a523cecffb2deabebcf962a173871557d8-1500x895.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382065,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYLd,1560176726,Employers Can Now Pay Salaries in Ether Via Crypto Startup Bitwage,"Bitwage, a startup that helps companies pay their employees in cryptocurrency, has added ether as a payroll option.  Announced Monday, companies that want to offer tax and HR-compliant ether benefits can sign up to offer it as a benefit to employees.  The company has been providing direct deposits of bitcoin since 2014, and serves over 30,000 workers. Employees, freelancers and independent contractors can receive from their clients or employers any percentage of their fiat obligations due to them in crypto.  The company has experimented with the ethereum ecosystem since 2017, including launching the consulting services firm Inwage, which built several projects on the second-largest blockchain. This includes the Moria initial coin offering, which raised $50 million, and a pilot project for a major insurance company that leverages ethereum for audit trail capabilities.  But adding ether to Bitwage's main offering ""took a lot of behind the scenes work... because the whole system was optimized for BTC,"" a company representative told CoinDesk. ""It's just a matter of now having gotten the infrastructure to add it.""  When Bitwage was founded five years ago, CEO Johnathan Chester realized that merchants were already accepting bitcoin, but there was no way for employees to get paid in it as well.  “Our goal was to close the financial loop,” Chester said in a statement. The company currently processes $2.5 million in monthly volume for contractors and full-time employees.  Bitwage provides two payment services, direct deposit – in which employees have part of their salaries sent to the company to be exchanged for crypto automatically through dollar cost averaging – as well as team wages, where Bitwage provides companywide payroll services. Team wage contracts are primarily provided for companies that may want to pay hundreds of contract employees spread across the globe with just one payment, the representative said.  Though the company makes a spread on the exchange, there is no fee for the basic service. There is also a premium version, which provides payments sooner and costs $15.99 per month.  Square offers a similar service where an employee’s direct deposit goes to the payments platform, but the employee has to manually swap it for bitcoin. Coinbase allows automatic monthly purchases of crypto out of a customer's bank account.  Several blue-chip companies have employees that use Bitwage to automatically convert their cash salaries into crypto including Amazon, Google, and Apple. Additionally, many gig workers for Uber, Caviar, and Doordash utilize the services, according to the representative.  Bitwage clients can have up to two payments distributions per pay period in either fiat or crypto as a non-premium user, or three for premium.  The company has received around $1 million in total funding from such investors as Draper Associates, Candela Reach Capital, and BPI France.

42382066,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYO9,1560171628,US Realtors Association Invests in Blockchain Startup Propy,"The venture capital arm of the U.S. National Association of Realtors (NAR) has bought a stake in blockchain-based real estate startup Propy.  Second Century Ventures – NAR's real estate technology VC fund – invested an undisclosed amount in Propy via its REACH accelerator program, according to a press release sent to CoinDesk on Monday.  Propy allows users to transact real estate online, recording the deals on a blockchain, as well as with traditional methods. It previously raised $15.5 million via an initial coin offering in 2017, according to Crunchbase.  Its blockchain-powered platform connects real estate buyers, sellers, and brokers allowing them to close property deals in a paperless, online process. Propy also provides real estate agent tools, including DocuSign, to help ensure security risks, such as wire fraud, are reduced.  The firm has previously helped auction a 17th century Italian mansion on a blockchain, partnering with Beverly Hills real estate brokerage Hilton & Hyland last May to sell part of the Palazzo Albertoni Spinola, which dates back to between 1580 and 1616.  It's also helped TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington purchase a $60,000 apartment in Kiev using ethereum and smart contracts to settle the deal.  Speaking of the investment, Propy CEO Natalia Karayaneva said:  ""We believe Propy is at the forefront of bringing automation and blockchain to real estate with its easy-to-use platform for agents, buyers, and sellers. Working with Second Century Ventures (SCV) and NAR executives will help achieving adoption of our products. We look forward to the next chapter in order to better our business tactics and goals at Propy.""

42422919,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qzPh,1560170415,Retail Giant Target Is Quietly Working on a Blockchain for Supply Chains,"Retail giant Target has quietly entered the blockchain space.  Since mid-2018 the Minnesota-based retailer has been working on a blockchain-powered solution for supply chain management, dubbed ConsenSource. More recently it pledged to support the Hyperledger Grid project, a supply chain framework that earlier saw participation from food giant Cargill, one of Target's suppliers, together with tech giant Intel and blockchain startup Bitwise.io.  To boost its distributed ledger technology-related work, Target is now looking for a blockchain engineer and systems developer, according to the company's career page.  The new engineer will be contributing to the recently open-sourced ConsenSource and to Hyperledger Grid, developing ""distributed ledger systems, protocols, smart contracts, CLI’s, and RESTful APIs in an open source environment,"" the job postinghttps://jobs.target.com/job/-/-/1118/12039647?utm_source=indeed.com&utm_campaign=corporate-tas&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_content=job_aggregator&ss=paid&dclid=CJSL_57L3uICFRZBDAodtfwO-A says.  ""I’m proud that Target will support the Hyperledger Grid project, and that we’re committing dedicated engineering resources to build out components in the Grid architecture,"" Joel Crabb, Target's vice president of architecture, wrote in a little-noticed post on its corporate blog.  The ConsenSource project, which Target recently open-sourced, was primarily focused on the certification of suppliers for the company's own paper manufacturing. Target has been ""working directly with the forest managers and certification boards"" studying the technology and trying to figure out what data can be shared on a distributed ledger, Crabb wrote.  The exploration led to Target to recognize the benefits of open-source projects – and supporting some.  The blog reads:  ""Many companies – including Target – see the most potential for enterprise blockchain initiatives as open source. Open-source projects require all participating parties to define the governance model collectively from the outset, so companies then can focus their time working on blockchain-based solutions that will lead to greater speed, transparency and cost savings.""  Target did not respond to CoinDesk's requests for comment by press time.  Secret R&D  Until now, Target has largely flown under the radar with its blockchain initiatives. The company hired Aarthi Srinivasan – who has previously worked at JPMorgan and IBM – as its director of product management for personalization, machine learning and blockchain, in 2016.  In December 2018, CoinDesk learned from a source within Hyperledger that Target – the eighth-largest retailer in the U.S. – had been working on a supply chain product under the umbrella of the open-source Hyperledger consortium.  The source, who did not want to be identified, said Target would join the Sawtooth Supply Chain project, which is developing a distributed application to track the provenance of food and other assets using the Sawtooth implementation of Hyperledger.  Emily Fisher, a spokesperson for the Linux Foundation, which oversees Hyperledger, said Monday: ""Target has made code contributions but is not a member of Hyperledger.""  While it is still in the development phase and far from reaching production, the Sawtooth project has been a hotbed of coding activity, with more than 5,000 commits from 46 contributors on GitHub. According to the ConsenSource GitHub repository, that project uses the Sawtooth code.  Among Target's notable moves has been incorporating identity verification technology from another Hyperledger project called Indy. Cargill, the food production giant, is also known to be involved in the supply chain project.  The Sawtooth codebase, which was contributed to Hyperledger by Intel, is the main alternative to Fabric, the best-known Hyperledger implementation, developed by IBM. Fabric is already being used in food tracking on a network called Food Trust – a project spearheaded by IBM and Target’s big-box rival, Walmart.  In its last annual report to shareholders, Target said it is investing in supply chain improvements.  The company is ""in the process of a broad migration of many mainframe-based systems and middleware products to a modern platform, including systems supporting inventory and supply chain-related transactions,"" the company said, without mentioning blockchain or DLT.  Update (June 10, 16:05 UTC): This article was updated with a comment from Hyperledger clarifying Target's relationship to the consortium.

42382061,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYKN,1560165651,Zilliqa Passes 'Milestone' With Addition of Smart Contracts to Its Blockchain,"""Next-generation"" cryptocurrency Zilliqa has announced the launch of smart contracts on its platform.  In an announcement sent to CoinDesk, Zilliqa president and chief scientific officer Amrit Kumar said passing the ""milestone"" means the project has ""developed the technology we envisioned two years ago, and now, we are open for business.""  Following the launch, developers will now be able to write and deploy smart contracts on the Zilliqa blockchain with the project's functional smart contract language, Scilla.  ""With this, we’ve come to realise our vision of a better smart contract language, one built with greater security guarantees at the language level,"" claimed Kumar.  The Singapore-based crypto platform presents itself as solving the common blockchain hurdle of scalability through sharding, an efficiency-boosting technique that predates bitcoin but has yet to prove its viability in big permissionless networks. The team claimed in its white paper in 2017 that “at ethereum’s present network size of 30,000 miners, Zilliqa would expect to process about [1,000] times the transaction rates of ethereum.”  Over the last six months, Zilliqa has passed other milestones, launching its mainnet and enabling transactions, Kumar said. According to CoinMarketCap data, its zilliqa (ZIL) token passed the $1 billion market cap threshold last May. At press time, that stands at around $200 million.  Among the core features offered by Zilliqa's smart contracts, Kumar listed that they are amenable to formal verification and come with a suite of static analyzers that help spot potential bugs and issues in contracts. Further, the Scilla language is designed to handle different operational components, such as computation and communication with other contracts, in a ""clean manner,"" eliminating complex interleaving.  ""This can prevent incidents like the DAO and the Parity hacks,"" Kumar said.  Scilla also comes with a suite of standard libraries, such as one that performs arithmetic operations in a ""safe manner,"" removing the need to rely on external libraries.

42382078,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYbz,1560164448,Bitcoin Risks Short-Term Bear Reversal Below $7.4K Price Support,"View  Bitcoin is on the defensive, having closed below $8,000 last week. The price has also established a bearish lower high at $8,135.  A short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change, however, would be confirmed if the price drops below $7,432 (June 4 low), establishing a lower low.  With the weekly chart reporting a bearish candlestick pattern, a UTC close below $7,432 looks likely.  The daily relative strength index's move above the falling trendline would revive the short-term bullish outlook.  Bitcoin's (BTC) bulls need to keep prices above key support at $7,432 to avert a short-term bearish reversal.  At the current price of $7,685 (as per Bitstamp), the leading cryptocurrency by market value is down 15 percent from the May 30 high of $9,097 – the highest level since the same month in 2018  The double-digit price drop has spurred fears of a trend reversal. After all, prices have found acceptance below the crucial 30-day price average. Further, key technical indicators are flashing signs of bullish exhaustion.  Even so, it is still too early to call a bearish reversal as BTC is yet to confirm the most basic of all bearish chart patterns, a paired lower high and lower low.  A lower high has been established, though, with the bounce from the June 4 low of $7,432 topping out at $8,135 on June 7.  Therefore, the immediate outlook is neutral and a bearish reversal would only be confirmed if BTC drops below $7,432 to print that lower low.  With the price currently trading at $7,730, the short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change is less than $300 away.  Daily chart  The lower high created by BTC’s shallow bounce from the June 4 low of $7,432 looks to be the right shoulder of a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal pattern.  A UTC close below $7,432 would activate twin bearish cues: a lower high/lower low and a head-and-shoulders (H&S) breakdown.  The H&S breakdown, if confirmed, would create room for a drop to $5,800 (target as per the measured move method). On the way lower, BTC may find support at the 50-day MA, currently at $7,000.  With the relative strength index (RSI) reporting a bearish divergence, a close below $7,432 looks likely.  Weekly chart  BTC fell 12.6 percent last week and closed Sunday (UTC time) well below $8,000, validating the bullish exhaustion signaled by the previous week’s doji candle.  Essentially, the doji candle and the bearish follow-through indicate the period of indecision or exhaustion in the market place has ended with the bears victorious.  The risks, therefore, are skewed to the downside.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42382070,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYRv,1560158752,G20 Reaffirms It Will Apply Expected Tough New FATF Rules on Crypto,"The G20 group of nations has reaffirmed it will align with standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the funding of terrorism (CTF) set to be finalized by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) this month.  Finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20, who met in Fukoka, Japan, over the weekend, made the commitment to applying the rules in a communique published on the website of the Japanese Ministry of Finance on Sunday.  The FATF standards are expected to set tough operating procedures for crypto exchanges, going beyond the basic “know your customer” (KYC) rules that most major exchanges now abide by. In addition to verifying and keeping records of their users’ identities, exchanges and other service providers would have to pass customer information to each other when transferring funds, just as banks are required to do – a procedure known in the U.S. as the “travel rule.”  Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis recently argued that the expected changes, as set out in a draft document in February, would be unrealistic and harmful for the crypto industry.  The G20, however considers the threat from crypto assets low, and recognizes their potential. The group said in the communique:  ""Technological innovations, including those underlying crypto-assets, can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy. While crypto-assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability at this point, we remain vigilant to risks, including those related to consumer and investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT). ""  It's also seeking possible additional measures, calling for the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and ""other standard setting bodies to monitor risks and consider work on additional multilateral responses as needed."" The G20 welcomed the FSB's directory of crypto-asset regulators, published in April, and its report on ongoing work, regulatory approaches and potential ""gaps"" in crypto-asset regulation.  Finally, addressing the issue of hacks in the crypto space, the G20 said:  ""We also continue to step up efforts to enhance cyber resilience, and welcome progress on the FSB’s initiative to identify effective practices for response to and recovery from cyber incidents.""

Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Nodl co-founder Michel Luczak said this new product will be a “full, self-validating, bitcoin and lightning node” that allows people to use the mobile wallet app without relying on Samouri Wallet’s servers. This has long been a point of contention, as critics argue the wallet’s privacy features are insufficient if users’ transaction data is stored on a centralized server anyway.  The new node devices will be available this year, the Samourai Wallet team told CoinDesk. Plus, Nodl node owners will be able to update their devices to add Samourai Wallet’s Dojo software. This software will include a feature called Whirlpool, which batches bitcoin transactions together across wallets in order to obfuscate the source of funds.  “In addition to Dojo being preloaded onto Nodl devices we will also be preloading Whirlpool desktop mixing, allowing users to access and manage their Samourai Wallet mixing on their desktop,” the Samourai team told CoinDesk.  The partnership comes as Nodl sales see an uptick, according to Luczak, expecting to sell roughly 500 devices in 2019 if the current trajectory continues.  “For the first time you’ll have a one-click install mixing service that’s available to anyone,” Luczak said.  Earlier this month, the company behind Samourai, Katana Cryptographic, announced its first venture funding round: a $100,000 investment from Cypherpunk Holdings.

On SundayThe Financial Tribune quoted minister Homayoun Haeri as saying that energy used by cryptocurrency miners in Iran should be charged in real prices and not be subsidized by the government.  Iran's government spends about $1 billion in electricity subsidies in the country with Iranian households paying just a fraction of the real cost of the electricity usage.  Authorities in Iran prohibit the mining and trading of cryptocurrencies. However, such activities continue to proliferate given the relatively low electricity costs in the country.  Sanctions imposed by the US on Iran has even encouraged more people in Iran to mine and trade cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency.  In anearlier report by CoinDesk, blockchain researcher Nima Dehqan at Tehran-based crypto startup Areatak said foreign investors from Spain, Ukraine, Armenia, and France have visited their cryptocurrency farms in Iran. Dehqan said his firm has already entered an agreement with an investor from Spain to establish a mining farm in Iran.  Dehqan said foreign cryptocurrency investors are keen on farming in Iran due to the cheap electricity in the country which costs well below $0.01 per kilowatt-hour. Further adding to Iran's appeal to cryptocurrency miners is the recent fall of the Iranian rial's value due to sanctions imposed by the US, according to Dehqan.

42382072,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYYD,1560139232,MPC Explained: The Bold New Vision for Securing Crypto Money,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Advances in cryptography are converging to help developers bring blockchain applications closer to the core decentralizing principles on which this technology is founded.  Inventions such as atomic swaps, zk-SNARKS and Lightning-based smart contracts are allowing developers to realize the dream of true peer-to-peer transactions in which neither party, nor an outside intermediary, can act maliciously. Witness the rising number of non-custodial and decentralized exchange (DEX) services for trading crypto assets.  This is exciting. But it also shines a light on another big problem that has curtailed the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology: secure key management.  For too long, the most reliable means of protecting the private keys that afford the holder control over an underlying crypto asset have been too clunky, insufficiently versatile, or difficult to implement on scale. User experience has been sacrificed in return for security.  Now, some big strides in another hugely important field of cryptography – secure multiparty computation, or MPC – point to a potential Holy Grail situation of both usability and security in a decentralized system.  A keyless wallet  Progress in this field was marked last week by Tel Aviv-based KZen’s public announcement of the specs for its new ZenGo wallet. ZenGo uses MPC, along with other sophisticated cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs and threshold cryptography, to share signing responsibility for a particular cryptocurrency address among a group of otherwise non-trusting entities.  The beauty of the KZen model is that security is no longer a function of one or more entities maintaining total control over a distinct private key of their own – the core point of vulnerability in cryptocurrency management until now. Instead the key is collectively derived from individual fragments which are separately generated by multiple, non-trusting computers.  The model draws on the genius of MPC cryptography.  With this approach, multiple non-trusting computers can each conduct computation on their own unique fragments of a larger data set to collectively produce a desired common outcome without any one node knowing the details of the others’ fragments.  The private key that executes the transaction is thus a collectively generated value; at no point is a single, vulnerable computer responsible for an actual key. (KZen’s site includes a useful explainer on how it all works.)  KZen is not the only provider of MPC solutions for blockchain key management. Unbound, another Israeli company, is going after the enterprise marketplace with its MPC solutions for crypto security.  Unbound’s prolific (if blatantly pro-MPC) blog offers different angles on the same argument.  It makes a repeated case for why MPC is superior to the two preferred approaches to crypto security of the moment: hardware security modules (HSM), on which hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor are built, and multi-signature (multisig) technologies, which are favored by exchanges.  Attacking the trade-offs  If KZen and Unbound are to be believed, MPC solutions resolve both the hot-versus-cold trade-off in key management and the dilemma of self-versus-managed custody.  Cold wallets, in which keys are stored in an entirely offline environment out of attackers’ reach, are quite secure so long as they remain in that offline state. (Though you really don’t want to lose that piece of paper on which you printed out your private key.)  But bringing them into a transactable, online environment poses an overly cumbersome challenge when you want to use those keys to send money. That’s perhaps not a problem if you’re just a HODLer who transacts rarely but it’s a serious limitation to blockchain technology’s prospects for transforming overall global commerce.  On the other hand, hot wallets have, until now, been notoriously vulnerable.  Whether it’s the relentless “SIM jack” attacks on people’s phones that are emptying out both hosted (third-party custodial) wallets and on-phone self-custody holdings, retail participants’ horror stories are legion. And, of course, we all know the stories of custodial exchanges being hacked – from Japan, to Hong Kong, to Canada, to Malta.  At the same time, the solution that regulated institutional investors are currently seeking – that custodians and exchanges build Fort Knox-like “military-grade” custody solutions – inherently contain a compromise.  Not only does this approach fail to resolve the dependence on a third-party, but there are serious doubts about whether any such solution can be forever safe from hackers, who are constantly improving their methods for getting over firewalls. In best-case scenarios, the constant IT upgrades becomes a massive money suck.  Alternative to HSMs and multisig  None of this is not to say that existing security technologies are useless.  Ledger and Trezor’s hardware devices – a more nimble form of cold wallet – are widely used by individuals who are uncomfortable with both external third-party custody and online, on-device self-custody wallets. And, separately, multi-signature (multisig) solutions, in which an m-of- quorum of keys are required to execute a transaction, have proven robust enough to be used by most exchanges.  But in both cases, vulnerabilities have been exposed. And to a large extent those risks come down to the fact that, regardless of the surrounding security model’s sophistication, the all-important keys are always sitting at single points of failure.  Just last week, researchers demonstrated how they could hack into a remote hardware security module. The irony: the researchers were from Ledger, which relies on HSM to secure its customers’ keys.  Multisig models arguably offer protections across such attacks, because a breach requires simultaneous control of more than one key held in separate locations, but the fact is that multisig solutions have also failed because of both technical and human vulnerabilities (inside jobs).  What’s more, both solutions are inherently limited by the need to customize them to particular specifications or ledgers. Crypto developer Christopher Allen pointed out last week , for example, that HSMs are particularly constrained by the fact that they are defined by government standards.  And in each case, the ledger-specific design of the underlying cryptography means there is no support for the kind of multi-asset wallets that will be needed in a decentralized interoperable world of cross-chain transactions.  By contrast, KZen is boasting that its key-less wallet will be a multi-ledger application from day one.  Challenges and opportunities  To be sure, MPC remains unproven in a practical sense.  For some time, the heavy resources needed to carry out these network computing functions made it a challenging, costly concept to bring into real-world environments. But rapid technical improvements in recent years have made this sophisticated technology a viable option for all kinds of distributed computing environments where trust is an issue.  And key management isn’t its only application for blockchains, either. MPC technology plays a vital role in MIT-founded startup Enigma’s work on “secret contracts” as part of its sweeping plan to build the “privacy layer for the decentralized web.”  (An aside: Enigma CEO and founder, Guy Zyskind, is also an Israeli. Israel has fostered a remarkable concentration of cryptographic expertise in this space.)  It would be unwise to assume that MPC, or any technology for that matter, will provide a perfect, totally infallible solution to security problems. It is always true that the biggest security threats come when human beings complacently believe security is not a threat.  However, if you squint hard enough, and think about how this technology’s prospects for better key management can be married to Enigma’s vision for an MPC-based secret contract layer and to the broader march toward decentralized, interoperable asset exchanges, a compelling vision of true peer-to-peer blockchain-based commerce starts to emerge.  At the very least, you need to watch this space.  Keys image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,Michael J.
