31234492,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630601,1721430041,Can Burns Send The Shiba Inu And LUNC Price To $0.01? Expert Chimes In,"The Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Terra Classic (LUNC) ecosystems have become known for their regular token burns, which aim to increase the value of these coins. A computer engineer has given his opinion on this burn mechanism, revealing between Shiba Inu and LUNC, which will likely reach their desired goal of $0.01. Will Shiba Inu And LUNC Reach $0.01? Computer engineer Charu Bey suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that only LUNC will likely reach its desired goal of $0.01 through its burn mechanism. He stated that the $0.01 price target is “not a dream for LUNC,” meaning it is more likely to become a reality at some point, although the engineer warned that it wasn’t financial advice. Related Reading: MOVR Bulls Assemble: Crypto Analyst Says A 2,000% Surge To $234 Is Imminent On the other hand, he expressed his sadness for Shiba Inu while suggesting that the meme coin’s burn mechanism hasn’t changed much, considering that the token still has a circulating supply of 589 trillion. He further remarked that the SHIB community is “very quiet” about this development, unlike the LUNC community, which is still dissatisfied despite burning millions of LUNCs daily, with the token currently having a circulating supply of “only” 5.44 trillion. Shiba Inu and LUNC have adopted similar burn mechanisms, with some transaction fees earned deployed for token burns. LUNC has, however, had extra help considering that the world’s largest crypto exchange by market cap, Binance, has also committed to burning trading fees earned from the token monthly. Data from LUNC Metrics shows that Binance has burnt almost 62 billion LUNC tokens (48.9% of total tokens burnt so far). Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has had to rely on the layer-2 network Shibarium for most of its token burns this past year. However, network activity on Shibarium has continued to slow at times, leading to a decrease in the rate at which Shiba Inu burns are carried out. How Token Burns Can Cause Shiba Inu To Reach $0.01 According to Shiba Inu’s burn tracker, Shiba Inu’s maximum circulating supply will need to drop to around 126 trillion for its price to reach $0.01. That means about 78.52% of the meme coin’s circulating supply must still be burnt to achieve this goal. Crypto YouTuber Jeff once suggested that it was almost unlikely for Shiba Inu to reach this price target, claiming that it would take about 1.1 million years just for 100 billion tokens to be burned. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Not Ready For $65,000 Retest, But Can It Reach $71,500? Crypto analyst Oscar Ramos previously suggested that Shiba Inu could reach $0.01 but added that he doesn’t see the meme coin going above this level because of its circulating supply. He made this statement in reaction to a prediction by the price prediction website Telegaon, which showed that Shiba Inu could reach $0.5 in 2040.

31232178,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630659,1721426405,Coinbase Analysts Warn: Bitcoin’s Upward Trend Could Hit a Wall — Here’s Why,"As Bitcoin is experiencing an uptrend in price increasing by 12.6% in the past week to trade above $66,000, analysts at Coinbase in a Friday report have disclosed potential limitations to its upward trajectory due to “increasing sell orders” on the exchange. According to the report, the recent appreciation in Bitcoin’s value has tempted many traders to capitalize by selling, which could curb further gains. Related Reading: Market Strategist Says Bitcoin Downtrend Is Finally Over, Here’s Where Price Is Headed Next A Wall Ahead, What Happens To Bitcoin Then? This report, which analyzes the market’s overall picture, was compiled by Coinbase researchers David Duong and David Han. They noted that sell orders have been rising on Coinbase within 5% to 10% of the mid-price, indicating a strong desire not to see higher prices for the digital currency. This suggests there might be a cooling-off from recent highs as traders take profits and reposition in response to current market conditions. According to Duong and Han: We may be seeing some profit taking at current levels and/or a greater willingness by market participants to sell into price appreciation, which may limit price moves to the upside Such activities are essential market sentiment indicators that could influence Bitcoin’s short-term value. In their analysis, Duong and Han also reference data from Arkham Intelligence, which highlights some external factors that are also at play contributing to the sell-side pressure. One significant factor is the ongoing Mt. Gox repayments, which have seen nearly 50,000 Bitcoin moved to exchanges since July 5. Despite this, the Mt. Gox trustee still holds a considerable amount of BTC, adding a layer of uncertainty and potential sell-side pressure to the market. However, some positive factors might help to offset the increased selling demand. One of the most relevant factors is the US political situation. In July, the U.S. political dynamics shifted dramatically resulting in a significant depreciation of the US dollar; the DXY index (which measures the dollar against a basket of other major currencies) falling by more than 2%, according to the report. Since the value of Bitcoin is primarily valued in US dollars, a weaker dollar means a higher relative value of Bitcoin which may provide a buffer against some of the downward pressures from increased sell orders. Further Roadblock On The Horizon Besides the Coinbase report that has already signaled an impending correction for Bitcoin, legendary crypto trader, Perter Brandt has also recently shared a notable concern for the top crypto. Brandt discloses that while he is “impressed” by Bitcoin’s upward trajectory so far, “the sequence of lower highs and lower lows continues despite the halving, despite the [exchange-traded fund] ETf, despite the hype.” This statement suggests a troubling trend for Bitcoin, indicating that instead of the asset having broken out of its current range, it has only continued to move in lower highs and lows.

31228820,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630622,1721421035,MATIC Targets $0.5030 As Bearish Pressure Halts Recent Uptrend,"Recent trading activities have caused the price of MATIC to slide, targeting the $0.5030 mark, following a period of strong upward momentum disrupted by bearish pressure. This sudden drop, driven by increasing bearish sentiment in the market, has sparked speculation among traders and investors about whether the $0.5030 support level will hold or if further declines are imminent. As the bearish sentiment around MATIC continues to build, this article seeks to analyze its current price movements and the technical indicators that suggest a sustained decline. The goal is to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of MATIC’s potential future trajectory. MATIC’s price was trading at approximately $0.511 and was down by 3.93% with a market capitalization of over $5 billion and a trading volume of over $250 million as of the time of writing. Its market capitalization and trading volume have decreased by 3.88% and 20.31% in the last 24 hours. Market Overview: MATIC Recent Performance And Current Slide On the 4-hour chart, MATIC shows an active bearish trend and is currently moving below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) toward the $0.5030 support level. It’s noteworthy that MATIC had previously attempted a bullish correction but was halted at $0.5673. The 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator indicates that MATIC may continue its bearish movement toward the $0.5030 mark, as the signal line has crossed below the SMA of the indicator, with both lines currently attempting a move below the zero line. On the 1-day chart, MATIC has experienced a three-day uninterrupted bearish move toward the $0.5030 support level, trading below the 100-day SMA. If this bearish momentum continues, the digital asset could drop below $0.5030, extending its downward trend. Finally, the 1-day composite trend oscillator indicates that MATIC’s price is likely to continue its current bearish trend, as the signal line is attempting to cross below the SMA of the indicator and move back into the oversold zone. Future Outlook: Potential Scenarios For MATIC’s Price Movement MATIC’s current price action suggests that the coin is on the verge of extending its bearish move, with $0.5030 as a crucial point to look out for. If the price reaches this level and breaks below, it could ignite a decline toward the $0.3132 support range. When this level is breached, the crypto asset may experience a further price decrease toward other lower levels. However, should MATIC face rejection at the $0.5030 level, it may start to ascend again toward the $0.9488 resistance level. It could further experience additional price gains, potentially challenging the $1.096 mark and other higher levels if the $0.9488 resistance is breached.

This development comes amid the imminent launch of these funds, which are expected to begin trading next week. Ethereum Futures Premium Highlights Little Confidence In ETH’s Price According to data from Laevitas, Ethereum’s fixed-month contracts annualized premium currently stands at 11%, suggesting that crypto traders aren’t bullish enough on ETH’s price. Further data from Laevitas shows that this indicator has yet to sustain levels above 12% this past month. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Not Ready For $65,000 Retest, But Can It Reach $71,500? This is surprising considering that the Spot Ethereum ETFs, which could launch next week, are expected to spark a price surge for Ethereum. Crypto analysts like Linda have predicted that ETH could rise to as high as $4,000 thanks to the inflows these Spot Ethereum ETFs could witness. However, crypto traders are not convinced that Ethereum’s reaching such heights is likely to happen, at least not soon enough. A plausible explanation for this lack of excessive bullishness is that Ethereum’s price could continue to trade sideways for a while, thanks to the $110 million daily outflows that research firm Kaiko projected could flow from Grayscale’s Spot Ethereum ETF. Moreover, this seems likely following the final S-1 filings by the Spot Ethereum ETF issuers, which showed that Grayscale has the highest fees. The asset manager plans to charge a management fee of 2.50%, while the highest fee among other Spot Ethereum ETF issuers is 0.25%. Grayscale had done something similar with its Spot Bitcoin ETF, setting its management fee at 1.5%, while the other Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers had management fees ranging between 0.19% and 0.39%. That move is believed to have been one of the reasons why Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF witnessed significant outflows following the launch of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Making A Case For Ethereum’s Inevitable Price Surge Crypto analyst Leon Waidmann has made a bullish case for ETH’s price and explained why Ethereum investors should be more bullish. He noted that the discount between Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and ETH’s price has significantly narrowed since the Spot Ethereum ETFs were approved earlier in May. Related Reading: Why Did The German Government Sell Off 50,000 Bitcoin In 2 Weeks Waidmann stated that this has given ETHE investors ample time to exit their positions without significant discounts compared to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Another reason GBTC is believed to have experienced such outflows was because of investors who were taking profits from having invested in the trust at a discounted price to Bitcoin’s spot price. However, unlike GBTC and other Spot Bitcoin ETFs, ETHE and other Spot Ethereum ETFs didn’t start trading immediately after approval. Therefore, Waidmann believes that whoever intended to profit from the discount between ETHE and ETH’s price must have already done so before now. As such, Grayscale’s ETHE shouldn’t witness the same amount of profit-taking as Grayscale’s GBTC did after it began trading.

Yet, fees have declined each of the last 3 months. Coinbase had a marvelous quarter in Q1-24. However, exchange data tracking has COIN transaction volume down 30% QoQ for Q2-24. Despite shorts throwing the towel and favorable seasonality, COIN is dramatically overvalued at 34x forward earnings. When I last covered Coinbase ( COIN ) for Seeking Alpha in April, I focused the article mainly on the performance of the company's Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) scaling blockchain Base. Since Ethereum's Dencun upgrade earlier this year, the Base blockchain has enjoyed explosive growth and has been one of the best performing secondary networks in the Ethereum ecosystem. In this update, we'll look at the last few months of Base data compared with major L2 peers. We'll also take a look at Coinbase's transaction volume trend and assess what investors can likely expect for Q2 earnings to be released in August. All About That Base, Still Base Fees for MAUs (Token Terminal) March was an absolutely explosive month for the Base blockchain. The network generated over $20.5 million in fees. These fees are revenue that go almost entirely to COIN, as Coinbase is the only sequencer on the network. The company gives roughly 10% of that fee generation to the Optimism Collective. But the bottom line is Base usage is a good thing for Coinbase's top line. Fees have admittedly been in decline since that initial post-Dencun spike earlier this year. During the second quarter, Base fees combined for $24.7 million. That said, Base is creating a somewhat sticky userbase with MAUs surging to 5.1 million for the month of June. This is up from just 1 million in February. L2 Rollup Share by Month (Dune Analytics/sealaunch) Despite ecosystem-wide declines in fees as the months have progressed post-Dencun, Base has continued to claim an ""unfair"" share of rollup profit. In both April and May, Base commanded over 60% of rollup profit. Since June, we've seen noticeable upticks in profit share from Arbitrum and Optimism, but base has still maintained about 40% of rollup profit share going back to the last 7 weeks. Earnings & Volume Data by YCharts By just about any important financial metric, Coinbase had a phenomenal quarter in Q1-24. At $1.6 billion in revenue and nearly $1.2 billion in net income, the company had its best quarter since 2021. This performance was driven largely by an absolute surge in transaction volume in the first three months of the year: Coinbase Quarterly Volume (The Block) Coinbase's $312 billion in Q1-24 volume was its best three month period since Q4-21. Interestingly, retail share of volume has largely been in freefall over that same period of time from 32.3% down to just 18% in the last quarter. This is potentially problematic for Coinbase because the margin on retail trading is so much better than that of institutions. The company generally earns somewhere between 1.7-2.5% on its retail trading business yet just a few bps on its institutional volume. Non-Tx Revenue (The Block) The company has done a nice job of growing non-transaction based revenue over the last several years. It has achieved this through growth in subscriptions, blockchain rewards, and interest income. These smaller but important business lines can help the company alleviate the cyclicality of its primary revenue driver. Coinbase Monthly Vol (The Block) Looking ahead to the company's Q2 report, exchange volume is likely to decline by roughly 30% quarter over quarter. Data from The Block shows $218.9 billion in total exchange volume for Coinbase between April and June. Short Interest & Seasonality As a stock that benefits from a highly risky industry, Coinbase has had a very large short position in the past; highlighted by about a 12-month period between June of 2022 and 2023. Since then, both short interest expressed through number of shares and short interest as a percent of shares outstanding has been in decline: Data by YCharts Today, we see the short interest as a percent of the outstanding shares down to just 3.7%. For all intents and purposes, the squeeze rally is seemingly over. That said, there may be a seasonal component to how the market views Coinbase. July has historically been one of the better months for COIN stock, with a mean change of over 15% over the last three years. COIN Seasonality (TrendSpider) August has generally been a bit more mixed for COIN historically, with a mean return of -1.2% despite positive returns in two out of three instances in the sample. What will certainly make a difference in COIN's performance through the rest of the year is how much cryptocurrencies are rallying. 12 Month Correlation (PortfolioVisualizer) Over the last twelve months, COIN has had a 65% correlation with the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) compared with just a 41% correlation with the S&P 500. Because of the margin Coinbase gets on retail trading compared to what it charges institutions, Coinbase benefits more from retail buying during FOMO rallies in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other cryptocurrencies rather than from the revenue it generates from institutional buyers. Tx Margin (Filings, Author's calculations) Given this, the spot Bitcoin ETFs are a bit of a double-edged sword for COIN because it's actually cheaper to buy BTC through ETFs than it is to own it on the exchange or in self-custody if one is simply buying for short to medium term speculation. This is a concept I explored recently . Valuation Depending on what your views are about the validity of blockchain-based digital assets or cryptocurrencies as investable assets, another important detail investors must be mindful of is the price they're willing to pay for a company. Even as someone who holds the view that digital assets and public blockchains have a bright future, I still don't know that I can justify paying 34x forward earnings and 10x forward sales to buy COIN: COIN Value Grades (Seeking Alpha) This screenshot shows just a few of the multiples COIN shareholders are paying to own the stock. But based on just about every metric that Seeking Alpha tracks when building its overall Valuation Grade , COIN scores a D- or F. Coinbase may indeed benefit from long-term growth in sequencer fees, centralized exchange volume, and non-transaction based revenue. But it's difficult to argue that it hasn't been priced in already. Closing Thoughts Even with an improving regulatory environment for the crypto industry in the United States, it's difficult for me to justify buying COIN at these valuations. I see several potential headwinds for the company's flagship transaction business, and I've elaborated on those headwinds in past articles ; namely, decentralized exchanges on-chain will potentially cannibalize centralized exchange transaction volume as they grow share of the market. Additionally, if retail BTC traders start doing more of their trading through ETFs rather than exchanges, Coinbase is swapping high margin business for low margin business even if it's the custodian of the ETF assets. All this said, shorting a company that is so highly correlated with Bitcoin is a dangerous game to play. I still think COIN is a hold today.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4705170-coinbase-priced-for-perfection?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31224671.jpeg

Q1 results showed revenue growth driven by transaction fees and institutional business, but concerns remain about debt and stock-based compensation. Uncertainty around the future regulatory environment and organic growth of the crypto industry suggests maintaining a Hold rating on Coinbase shares at around $240 per share. Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) shares experienced a rally this week, following the near-assassination of Donald Trump but also his choice of Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. COIN 1M Price History (Seeking Alpha) Vance is known to be a proponent and owner of Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ), the first known member of the Senate to have a stake in it, and thus the first running mate on a Presidential ticket as well. Following the windfall of goodwill around Trump's survival of the assassination, this makes pro-crypto administration seem more likely, which would benefit a company like Coinbase. Yet, I believe most of Coinbase's story is independent of what happens in the election. Moreover, we'll need actual results with a concrete program before we can make bold assumptions about the future of this company. Consequently, I am going to reaffirm my Hold rating from last time. Previous Thesis In my initial coverage of COIN, I considered the shares to be likely fairly valued, based on a Discounted Cash Flow model. Author's previous calculation One may note that a decent amount of growth is implied in this valuation. The price actually did drop briefly to about $200, but with this rally, it's closer to the valuation I gave last time. Coinbase's own thesis is that it will go beyond being a crypto exchange from which it garners transaction fees; its Stablecoin product will change global finance as it challenges big transactors like Visa Inc. ( V ) and Mastercard Incorporated ( MA ). While I generally agree that they are positioned to assume such a role, how quickly and successfully it will materialize is less certain, as it will depend on natural developments in crypto that are outside of Coinbase's control. Even if we trust the growth thesis, long-term investors would probably deserve a margin of safety, hence why I steered clear from a Buy. Additionally, I expressed concerns about the debt on the balance sheet and the high level of stock-based compensation. Q1 Results Q1 2024 results have since come out , and so far they are positive. Revenues showed aggressive growth compared to prior quarters. Q1 2024 Company Presentation While Stablecoin is where the company sees its long-term potential, this revenue growth was driven by something else. Revenue Breakdown (Q1 2024 Form 10Q) The biggest cause for the gain, especially compared to prior-year quarters, was transaction revenue, more activity occurring on the platform. CEO Brian Armstrong noted in Q1 earnings : Our institutional business continued to see meaningful growth, in part driven by the excitement around Bitcoin ETFs, which drove new customer adoption across our product suite. Coinbase Prime reached all-time highs in trading volume and active clients and nearly 40% of our clients engaged with three or more products in Q1 . Turning to derivatives. Both Coinbase Financial Markets and Coinbase International Exchange have shown promising growth in their early stages. In Q1, Coinbase International Exchange added 15 new perpetual future listings. We've also increased the position limits across both products. The spike in activity appeared to track the rally in BTC in the lead-up the latest halving this April. BTC 6M Price History (Seeking Alpha) Transaction fees for Coinbase have often come and gone, as was mentioned in my previous article. We should watch closely to see if those revenues persist in both Q2 and the following quarters. Otherwise, I believe the main areas to watch for growth are their other revenue sources, namely Stablecoin and blockchain rewards. Q1 2024 Form 10Q Since the end of Q4 2023, long-term debt also rose by over $1 billion. This came from the issuance of 2030 Convertible notes that quarter, the purpose of which was to repay debt with any sooner maturities. As their cash balance has also increased accordingly, it seems likely that they will sit on an elevated cash position, earning some net interest income, while they wait for an opportunity. As such, I don't expect the $4B debt obligation or fully diluted figures to remain at these levels for the long term. Cash Flow Statement (Q1 2024 Form 10Q) Stock-based compensation also says year-over-year growth, at a value of more than half of operating cash flows. This is also another trend that we will want to observe carefully for increases. Trump's Running Mate: JD Vance Since Trump's selection of Vance was associated with a modest rally, it is worth thinking about the impact of this on the legal and regulatory environment for crypto and Coinbase. I'll quote Armstrong again from Q1 earnings: In Q1, the court ruled on our motion to dismiss the SEC's claim regarding the Coinbase wallet, which was a significant win for self-custodial wallets across the industry. This win provided clarity for us and developers to continue to drive our onchain product growth, which we believe is an important element to fulfilling our mission of increasing economic freedom. Coinbase wallet is an important part of their operations, so this is an area of concern for sure. While they don't need a friendly administration to win in the courts (and they had a partial win already), the SEC is part of the executive branch and can pull back if guided to do so from above. Whether Trump himself will adopt a friendlier stance to crypto after being elected is one thing. As Politico reported back in May , he's publicly adopted a more favorable stance compared to his first term, but I feel Trump also tends to take vague stances depending on the audience he's trying to win. Vance perhaps represents something less ephemeral. Yet, that doesn't mean it produces overnight results upon a Trump victory. Becoming Vice President would mean Vance is no longer a Senator. While the VP is technically a member of the Senate (as its President), this is not a lawmaking role. The Vice President only presides over the sessions, and often this role is delegated to the President Pro Tempore. The hope here is that Vance will positively influence Trump to make favorable executive decisions through bodies such as the SEC. Until that happens and until a clear policy exists, I don't see now as the time to start driving COIN to a premium. Even if policy becomes more favorable, crypto as an industry still needs to grow and mature organically. The decentralized nature of the asset class means that government policy can help on the margins, but ultimately cannot drive it. More people need to begin to adopt it at greater scales. This requires a cultural change, more than a political one. Going Forward With Q2 results set to be released at the beginning of August, we will want to observe if Q1's transaction revenues remained high or if those were just cyclical business opportunities that tracked the BTC halving. Similarly, we'll want to see if debt is paid down and if stock-based compensation increases or moderates. Since my previous valuation took into account cyclical spikes by using an average of free cash flow, I don't yet see a reason to update my valuation until it's clear that this revenue spike has more secular, long-term momentum behind it. Not enough changed for me to think that my previous valuation of around $240 per share (again, for a 10% discount rate) needs revision, but future insights by management toward these changes being sticky would cause me to reconsider. Conclusion It's been an interesting week, as Trump was nearly assassinated. This alone brings to mind the impact of regulations on investments, some industries more than others, like crypto. Naming a pro-crypto running mate in JD Vance raised the price in recent days, but Trump himself is the one who would be calling executive shots, and he isn't guaranteed to win. Coinbase, meanwhile, still shows signs of cyclicality and, Q1's results didn't reflect growth in the operations that contribute more to the long-term picture. Rather, they recall moments of bullishness seen in periods such as 2021. Crypto remains something of an outsider asset class, and I believe it will continue to show this cyclicality until it becomes more mainstream. This requires us to ask for a proper margin of safety, and around $240 per share, I don't think COIN offers that. Until future quarters and the conclusion to the election decisively indicate a rise of free cash flow is on the way, I maintain my previous valuation and the Hold rating.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4705163-coinbase-q1-results-likely-cyclical-election-poses-uncertainty?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31222956.jpeg

Solana rose 8%, topping $170 for the first time since early June.  Crypto observers highlight the resiliency of decentralized blockchains as a malfunctioning software update caused worldwide disruptions in IT systems.  The crypto rally resumed on Friday with bitcoin {{BTC}} notching its highest price in a month, while the world grappled with a major IT outage.  BTC started rising from $64,000 during the early U.S. trading hours and broke above $67,000 later in the day for the first time since June 17. The price increase was accompanied by strong trading volumes for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT). At press time, the largest crypto asset changed hands slightly above $67,000 advancing 5.5% over the past 24 hours.  Solana {{SOL}} led among altcoin majors with an 8.5% increase over the same period, topping $170 for the first time since early June. The token outperformed the broad-based digital asset benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which rose 4.3%.     Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} reclaimed the $3,500 level, but underperformed with a 3% increase. The first spot-based ETH exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S. will likely start trading on Tuesday next week, Friday regulatory filings by Cboe showed.  Cryptocurrencies slid lower earlier this week in tandem with a U.S. stock sell-off. However, Friday's rally happened as major equity indexes continued their losing streak.  The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8%, while the broad-based S&P 500 lost 0.6% as of 1 p.m. ET, while gold plummeted over 2% during the day following a fresh all-time earlier this week.  As a software update by cybersecurity service provider CrowdStrike caused widespread computer outages around the world halting airlines, banks and businesses, some crypto observers emphasized the resiliency of decentralized systems like public blockchains compared to centralized networks.  Read more: CrowdStrike Outage Could Be Fixed Within the Day, Unlikely Caused by a Hack, Polymarket Bettors Say  Charles Edwards, founder of crypto hedge fund Capriole Investments, took notice of bitcoin's rapid surge coinciding with the U.S. traditional market opening, perhaps a sign of bidding from institutional investors.

QCP analysts noted strong demand for December $100,000 bitcoin call options from institutions.  Mads Eberhardt, crypto analyst at Steno Research, expressed a bullish view for the second half of the year for crypto assets, supported by multiple tailwinds including coming U.S. interest rate cuts, rising liquidity, regulatory clarity in Europe and rising chances of more crypto-friendly U.S. leadership.

Though BTC is stagnant, analysts are upbeat, expecting prices to rise in the days to come. Is Bitcoin Ready To Rip Higher: Analyst Says Bulls Are Eyeing $140,000 Taking to X, one analyst has picked out an unusual development: In the weekly chart, the Bitcoin Bollinger Bands (BB) is currently at their tightest level in history. Besides April 2016 and July 2023 events, the Bitcoin BB is tightening, forming a squeeze. Related Reading: Solana Price Could Eclipse $1,400 As Massive Bull Flag Emerges Since BB is a technical indicator used to gauge underlying volatility, what’s happening now should draw traders’ attention. Specifically, prices tend to explode within the next few sessions whenever BB forms a squeeze, compressing to what is now. However, traders should also know that the direction of breakout can be in either direction. In the past, Bitcoin prices rose higher. To illustrate, after the BB squeeze in July, the coin went on to fly in the coming months, breaking $70,000 by March before the coin rose to $73,800. If the past guides, and indeed, prices explode at the end of this squeeze, the analyst predicts Bitcoin flying to $140,000 and even $190,000 in the next few months. The expansion would be a welcomed boost for bulls, considering that prices are now in what the analyst described as a “boring zone.” Any uptick above $73,800 and all-time highs, pushing BTC to six-digit levels, would automatically be in the “banana zone.” Spot BTC ETF Issuers On A Buying Spree, Donald Trump’s Endorsement The confidence that Bitcoin will rip higher is also due to fundamental factors. Despite the current price lull after the refreshing surge earlier this week, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers are buying. BlackRock is spearheading this buying spree. Records show that the asset manager bought over $1 billion of BTC in July. On July 18, one observer noted that they bought 18,600 BTC, or $107 million worth of the coin, on behalf of their clients. According to SosoValue, as of July 19, BlackRock’s IBIT manages over $20 billion worth of BTC. Related Reading: Mass Exodus?

Some people think this move has something to do with the approval process for spot Ethereum ETFs. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Breaches Key Resistance, Setting Stage For 1,350% Boom — Analyst Crypto Community Clueless On Meeting Cancellation There has been an obvious shakeup in the cryptocurrency market because of the sudden about-face. XRP, Ripple’s native coin, fell 8% to $0.58, its 24-hour low. Trade volume was down as well, yet it rose 20%, showing investors’ interest amid uncertainties. There is a lot of talk in the market that the SEC’s decision might have something to do with the process of approving spot Ethereum ETFs. Some of these funds have already been given preliminary approvals and were supposed to start trading next week. The US regulator may have canceled the meetings as a smart move in light of these events. XRP market cap currently at $30.9 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Market Experts Keep A Close Eye On The Altcoin Technical experts are paying close attention to how the price of XRP changes in this unstable market. Javon, a renowned analyst, identified a chart pattern that resembles XRP’s recent bull run. The symmetrical triangular pattern expanding since 2018 matches the 2014–2017 trend. The first pattern led to a rapid rise that sent XRP from about $0.005 to a staggering high of $3.347, a rise of almost 43,000%. $XRP (Ripple) is RIGHT NEAR a point of BREAKOUT 🤯!

According to Javon’s prediction, the price of XRP could climb to a level above $237. Even though this prediction is very high, it fits with how things have been in the past and shows that things could go up from where they are now. XRP: Resistance And Support The technical indicators at hand provide XRP buyers with a mixed bag of data. In terms of support, the altcoin is still higher above the 50% Fibonacci retracing line and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. Strong support is spotted at $0.5820 and $0.5850. These figures are quite significant as they highlight major areas where the price may settle and maybe even rise. On the other hand, the coin meets strong opposition at different levels. Right now, there is resistance around $0.620. There are also bigger blocks at $0.6350, $0.6420, and possibly even $0.6550 and $0.680. Related Reading: Dogecoin Big Rally Ahead: Analyst Sees ‘Most Beautiful’ Chart Pattern If there is a clear break above these support levels, more gains could happen. But if XRP fails to break through these levels, there may be a drop to the downside. The price is likely to find support near $0.600, and it will likely go down even more if it falls below $0.5850.

42407843,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6D6S,1721401200,A Second Look at Third-Party Token Allegations in the SEC's Case Against Binance,"Last week, a federal judge convened a hearing for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's case against Binance after publishing her ruling on Binance's motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuit.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Third-party questions  The narrative  Last week, a federal judge said she would review her ruling in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) case against Binance and affiliated entities (namely Binance.US and founder Changpeng Zhao) after attorneys for the world's largest crypto exchange said they interpreted the ruling in a specific way beneficial to them.  During a hearing on July 9, attorneys for Binance said they interpreted Judge Amy Berman Jackson's June 28 ruling on Binance's motion to dismiss the SEC's case as moving third-party tokens – digital assets alleged to be unregistered securities by the SEC that were issued by various companies not named Binance – out of the case. The judge said that was not her intention, which kicked off a nearly hour-long back-and-forth over whether she had sufficiently addressed both Binance and the SEC's written arguments over these specific tokens.  Why it matters  The SEC's June 2023 lawsuit against Binance alleges the exchange offered and sold BNB, Binance's token, as an unregistered security; that it sold its BUSD stablecoin as an unregistered security; that it failed to register as a broker, clearing agency or exchange; that its staking service violated federal securities laws; and that it commingled customer funds. As part of its allegations, the SEC named 10 different cryptocurrencies including solana (the rest are listed below) it alleged were unregistered securities.  It's the status of the specific claims about the 10 tokens that were discussed during last week's hearing – and it's difficult to say how exactly this may resolve or what the implications are for the case. On the one hand, if the judge decides that the third-party tokens should be removed from the specific charges against Binance, that's one less thing for the exchange to have to defend itself against and it may limit or otherwise shape the scope of discovery. On the other hand, the judge seemed to indicate she did not believe her order moved the tokens out of the case, which goes the other way in terms of how much discovery the SEC may be entitled to.  Breaking it down  In her June 28 ruling, Judge Jackson said the SEC had brought plausible charges against Binance, Binance.US and Zhao tied to staking, the initial coin offering and ongoing direct sales of Binance's BNB token, the BNB vault (a staking and rewards program) and failing to register, as well as fraud. Charges against Binance's Simple Earn savings accounts, its BUSD stablecoin and secondary sales of BNB from parties other than Binance were dismissed.  The SEC alleged that Binance in particular listed 10 tokens that it viewed as securities, as examples of how the exchange was violating federal securities laws by being a broker, dealer and clearinghouse: SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS and COTI. In its motion to dismiss, Binance argued that the SEC couldn't plausibly allege that they were securities, saying they didn't meet the tenets of the Howey Test.  Two of Binance's arguments – that the claims failed under the Major Questions Doctrine and that there needed to be a formal contract – were already ""soundly rejected,"" the judge said during the hearing.  SEC attorney Matthew Scarlato said Binance's arguments were addressed in the regulator's opposition memo, which pushed back on the exchange's Howey arguments and said that the tokens were also tied to a common enterprise where investors could reasonably expect a profit.  Ultimately, the judge said she'd take another look at both the motion to dismiss, which Binance filed in September, and the SEC's opposition memo, filed in November, to review the arguments made about the third-party tokens.  Last week's hearing also saw the two parties (and judge) agree to a July 29 deadline for jointly filing a proposed schedule for the next steps, which may address other ongoing discovery efforts.  The judge also took aim at bloggers who she said misinterpreted her opinion as a ""grand ruling"" on stablecoins or secondary crypto transactions in general, suggesting it was closely focused on the actual case in front of her.  ""I wasn't asked to decide and I didn't decide whether a stablecoin could ever"" be an investment contract, nor did the judge rule that secondary transactions of tokens by third parties could never be investment contracts, she said near the end of the hearing.

Judge Sends Coinbase Back to the Drawing Board Over Efforts to Subpoena SEC’s Gary Gensler: Judge Failla is also the presiding judge over the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase.

In a post on X, Indian crypto exchange WazirX said the exploit was related to a multisig wallet using Liminal's digital asset custody service. The attack stemmed from a ""discrepancy between the data displayed on Liminal's interface and the transaction's actual contents,"" it said.  Liminal, for its part, said its infrastructure had not been breached and that all wallets – including WazirX's – remain safe. A multisig wallet is one that requires several people to sign a transaction before it can be executed.  ""There is no breach in Liminal’s infrastructure, wallets and assets,"" Liminal said in a blog post. ""Unfortunately three of the victims machines have been found injecting malicious payloads into the transaction indicating a sophisticated, well planned and targeted attack on one specific Gnosis Smart Contract Multi-Sig wallet.""  The exchange filed a police report and engaged with the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) earlier today. The stolen funds account for more than 45% of its $500 million holdings, according to a transparency report from June. Crypto security firm Elliptic said that North Korean hackers appear to be behind the exploit.

According to the strategist, Bitcoin may be heading to a new price target, driven by the positive shift in its market value. Bitcoin Downtrend Is Over A crypto analyst identified as ‘Rekt Capital’ on X (formerly Twitter) has announced to his 484,500 followers that Bitcoin’s prolonged downward trend was officially over. The analyst, who has been monitoring the cryptocurrency’s market and price actions, has suggested that Bitcoin may be getting ready for a robust recovery. Related Reading: MOVR Bulls Assemble: Crypto Analyst Says A 2,000% Surge To $234 Is Imminent Rekt Capital has also disclosed that a fresh uptrend has begun for the pioneer cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst shared a detailed price chart depicting Bitcoin’s price movements in 2024, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s current price position. With Bitcoin steadily moving out of bearish trends, Rekt Capital predicts that the cryptocurrency could see its price surging between $65,000 to $71,500. The analyst revealed that for Bitcoin to reach this bullish price target, it will have to successfully break past $65,000 to form a new red cluster of price action while maintaining a stable value. Rekt Capital disclosed that Bitcoin is currently trying to claim the $65,000 mark, however this price range is acting as a resistance level. He also noted that Bitcoin will have to close daily above $65,000 before it can fully enjoy a trend continuation to the upside. Despite Rekt Capital’s optimistic projections for Bitcoin’s price, the cryptocurrency has recently recorded slight declines in its value. CoinMarketCap’s data reveals that Bitcoin’s price declined by 1.35% in the last 24 hours. Although Bitcoin was on an uptrend over the past week, increasing by a whopping 11.98%, its price is still reflecting a bit of volatility and experiencing significant drops in its daily trading volume. Santiment has also reported that the amount of Bitcoin holders has dropped aggressively, driven by traders’ belief that the March all-time high was the highest Bitcoin’s price would reach in 2024. On the flip side, the market intelligence platform has suggested that large-scale liquidations such as this will likely increase the probability of a continued rebound for Bitcoin. BTC Holds Steady Near $65,000 Resistance In another X post, crypto analyst, Aksel Kibar highlighted Bitcoin’s recent price actions, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency has been testing resistance levels around $65,000 for the past five months. Sharing a detailed chart of Bitcoin’s price movements from 2011 to 2025, Kibar disclosed that Bitcoin was holding on strong, only witnessing slight price deviations which possibly indicates sustained interest from investors. Related Reading: Prophet Brandon Briggs Predicts XRP Price Explosion To $10,000 The analyst has interpreted Bitcoin’s recent behavior as a positive sign for a long-term bullish outlook. Kibar also noted that when a cryptocurrency lingers near a specific resistance level without a significant sell-off, it often signals an imminent breakout.

Investment flows into ETH have been positive year to date, but lag behind smart contract peer networks like Solana. Dencun upgrade reduced fees for L2 scaling chains, indirectly turning ETH inflationary again. Back in March, I covered the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain for Seeking Alpha. Fresh off a Wall Street Breakfast survey of Seeking Alpha readers indicating crypto may not be an investable asset class, I argued that networks like Ethereum, while certainly risky, should be viewed as infrastructure improvements to how money is transacted over the internet: Let’s instead think of the distributed ledger technology where each of these assets live more through the perspective of banking rather than the dollar itself. Over the last couple of decades we’ve seen the internet disrupt numerous forms of medium that previously utilized physical materials. Letters are now emails. Physical newspapers are now online. Both terrestrial radio and linear television are being replaced by streaming. With the backdrop of the network's Dencun upgrade top of mind, I made the argument that improvements to Ethereum's scalability was ultimately bullish for the native asset of the ETH ecosystem, since it is generally required to facilitate transactions. Since publishing, Ethereum has not only declined, but is trailing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as well: Data by YCharts In this update, I'd like to go over what we're seeing in the market in the four months since my Dencun piece and why Ethereum may have some hurdles that need to be addressed going forward. TPS and Fund Flows Data by YCharts It may be surprising for some to see, but the truth is daily transactions on Ethereum have been in decline since the second half of 2021. On the surface, this looks bad. But the reality is Ethereum address scaling is indeed happening on layer 2 networks like Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ), Optimism ( OP-USD ), and Base. The latter of which utilizes a sequencer operated by Coinbase ( COIN ). Scaling Activity (L2Beat) As of July 17th, Ethereum's mainnet transactions per second figure, or TPS, came in at little above 13. The aggregated layer 2 chains collectively added 306 TPS for a scaling factor of 22.3x. For the broader Ethereum ecosystem, this is great for utility. However, for ETH holders it hasn't proven to deliver a higher price for ETH, the asset. The argument could certainly be made that ETH ran up too quickly between February and March with Bitcoin's spot ETF approvals lifting all boats, but capital flows into the asset class seem to tell a different story: Crypto Investment Flows (CoinShares) Investment flows into ETH have only recently gone positive year to date and actually lag smart contract peer Solana ( SOL-USD ). Without investment capital flowing into Ethereum products, ETH's primary demand drivers are either transaction fee payment or asset staking for yield. Staked ETH vs Network Reward Rate (StakingRewards) There are 33.1 million ETH in stake as of article submission. That's up a whopping 52% over the last year. While it's clearly true that more ETH has been staked over the last twelve months, the reward rate has come down dramatically with the increased stake. At a 3.5% reward rate from staking ETH currently, investors are actually better off in T-bills if the price of ETH stays flat. This brings us to fees. The Fee Paradox Daily Transactions (Artemis) One of the major selling points of the Dencun upgrade is that it reduces fees for L2 scaling chains. That has indeed been the case, and we've seen the surge in activity on L2s as proof positive that fee reduction increases usage. Optimism, Base and Arbitrum have been big beneficiaries here, with those three chains producing a combined 169.6 million transactions in June - up 270% from 45.9 million transactions in February. But the good news is also bad news: Monthly Fees (Token Terminal) Again, if we view public blockchain networks as internet payment infrastructure, then Ethereum's Dencun upgrade has arguably hurt the bull cash for ETH as an asset in the short to medium term. Following Dencun, mainnet fees have essentially collapsed from $606.8 million in March to $142.4 million in June. Without L2 scaling chains paying mainnet to the degree that they were before Dencun, ETH has flipped back to inflationary since March: ETH Inflation vs Price (StakingRewards) Pre-Dencun, there had been a correlation between ETH's inflation rate and the price of ETH. As a deflationary asset, supply destruction created asset price increases. We can think of this similar to how buybacks have aided in pushing stock prices higher. Longer term, this is less of a concern, provided scaling through L2s (and even L3s) continues going forward. And there is nothing at this point in time that would indicate that growth won't continue. Like mainnet, L2s generally require ETH for transaction fees as well, they're just far cheaper per transaction. Key Risk: Fragmentation Beyond mainnet fee reduction, I see network fragmentation as one of the biggest risks currently facing the Ethereum ecosystem today. Interoperability needs improvement. It's easy to bridge from an L2 to Ethereum and back. What is less straightforward is moving liquidity between the L2s. This is not a problem that competing L1 chain Solana has at the moment, and we've seen the usage of that chain begin to challenge Ethereum in recent weeks based on daily fees: Daily Fees (Artemis) This phenomenon has actually created a scenario where Solana trades a lower price-to-fee multiple than Ethereum: P/F Comparison, July 17th (Token Terminal) As I've said numerous times through my Seeking Alpha work, there are not yet well-defined valuation multiples that can help investors determine what is comparatively cheap or expensive. For smart contract networks, I like price to fees personally, but others may have a different view. Closing Thoughts I'm still long Ethereum and believe that spot ETFs in the US will bring more investment capital into the asset class. In my view, there have been noticeable changes in how the U.S. regulatory apparatus is treating the industry. We've recently seen the Securities and Exchange commission drop its investigation into stablecoin issuer Paxos Global over Binance USD ( BUSD-USD ) after issuing a Wells Notice last year. Furthermore, former President Donald Trump, who has released NFTs on Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), is expected to speak at Nashville's Bitcoin conference in late July. For long-term crypto investors, Ethereum is still a must. Despite the price of ETH lagging significant improvements in the usability of the EVM ecosystem, future growth in on-chain activity should propel ETH higher, as it is still the gas that keeps the engine going.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4705087-ethereum-the-price-of-scalability?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31214323.jpeg

The company also said it was ""collaborating with forensic experts and law enforcement agencies to identify and apprehend the perpetrators.""  Crypto exchange WazirX has filed a police complaint after it suffered a $230 million hack on Thursday.  The firm has also reported the incident to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), it said on X. Engaging with CERT could mean it is seeking the help of India's premier agency which responds to computer related security incidents.  The development comes a day after the crypto exchange saw $230 million in withdrawals in a security breach affecting one of its wallets. WazirX said ""many exchanges"" were ""cooperating"" with them and that their immediate plans included ""tracing the stolen funds, recovering customer assets, and conducting a deeper analysis of the cyber attack."" The company also said it was ""collaborating with forensic experts and law enforcement agencies to identify and apprehend the perpetrators.""  The next step will be a First Information Report (FIR), a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. In India, after a complaint is filed, a First Information Report (FIR) is prepared by the police if they determine an official investigation is required. Involving the police could mean further scrutiny of WazirX's books, operating systems and security standards.  CERT-In did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  India's Finance Ministry declined to comment. Since cryptocurrency remains unregulated in the absence of a legislation passed in parliament the sector remains out of the ambit of almost all authorities except, in a limited way, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-India).  WazirX, which is registered with FIU-India, which falls under the Finance Ministry, has sent the body an incident report. However, the FIU is mandated with monitoring transactions under the nation's Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Given the WazirX incident is a security breach, the incident does not fall under the FIU's ambit. The FIU declined an in-person request to comment.  “There is no crypto-specific regulation in India so far, and the industry would benefit from clear regulatory expectation on issues like security standards, risk management, and consumer protection,"" Joanna Cheng, Associate General Counsel at Fireblocks told CoinDesk via an email. ""Regulatory intervention in this space would also mean that exchanges that service large numbers of retail customers are held accountable for their actions (or inaction).""  Sumit Gupta, the co-founder of CoinDCX, another prominent Indian cryptocurrency exchange, told CoinDesk that they had ""reached out WazirX to extend our support to their customers and are open to ideas and suggestions on how we could support them.""

Crucial for gauging mood in the market, this indicator has been progressively dropping as traders become less optimistic that Bitcoin may rise beyond its historic high of $73,750, which it last touched on March 14. The general feeling in the market is that people don’t think Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high this year. Related Reading: THORChain (RUNE) Primed For Big Gains, Analyst Eyes $20 Milestone Largely due to “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” (FUD), smaller investors of the asset tend to sell off their holdings, a pattern that is reminiscent of previous market cycles. It is interesting to note that after a large number of smaller buyers sell their Bitcoin, bigger holders usually start to buy more. This could set the stage for future rallies. At first glance, this trend seems worrying, but it could be setting the stage for the next bull market. 👋 Bitcoin’s amount of holders (any wallets with >0 coins) have been dropping aggressively as traders still seem to believe the March ATH was as good as it’s going to get in 2024. When we see mass liquidations like this, the probability of a continued rebound only increases. pic.twitter.com/YTHEFTtfhY — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 17, 2024 Bitcoin: Past Patterns Point To A Recovery Santiment notes that historical patterns show that big declines in wallet activity frequently precede notable price rebounds. Long-term investors recognize that these times of smaller holdings’ capitulation typically provide ideal conditions for future price spikes. People who use Bitcoin have seen similar patterns in the past, where the number of active wallets dropped a lot and then prices recovered again. There are 672,510 fewer Bitcoin owners now than there were a month ago, data by Santiment show. This could mean that the price is about to go up again. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is $64,894, down significantly from its most recent peaks but still in a strong position that gives investors optimism. Expert Forecasts Fuel Hope Reiterating his optimistic stance on Bitcoin, well-known proponent of the cryptocurrency and CEO of Jan3 Samson Mow has added another level of fascination to the present state of the market. Mow, who is well-known for his unwavering support of the leading cryptocurrency, has set a lofty goal: he believes that Bitcoin might soar to $1 million in the coming year. The bull run starts at $0.1M. This is just the unwinding of the fakery to make retail think #Bitcoin is over. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 17, 2024 According to him, if Bitcoin reaches $100,000, it will spark off a bull run that would take the cryptocurrency to previously unheard-of heights.

Bernstein experts, for their part, have raised their estimates for Bitcoin’s price. They now think it could reach $200,000 by 2025 and even $1 million by 2033. They say this is because of the rise in demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs and the recent halving of the block reward, which reduces the number of new Bitcoins coming onto the market.

42407840,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6Czq,1721390526,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Trades at $64K as Biden Withdrawal Likelihood Increases,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin traded either side of $64,000 following a retreat from $65,000 on Thursday. The increasing likelihood of Joe Biden withdrawing from the race for U.S. president has taken some of the wind out of BTC's sails after it briefly regained $66,000 earlier this week. With a second term in the White House for Donald Trump considered the far more beneficial outcome for the crypto industry, BTC was buoyed by Biden's poor performance thus far in the campaign coupled with the assassination attempt on the Republican nominee. The possibility of a Biden withdrawal may mean that crypto traders' sentiment has been tempered slightly. BTC has dropped about 0.9% in the last 24 hours, while the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, fell 1.9%.  Bitcoin and shiba inu traded at substantial discounts on Indian crypto exchange WazirX following Thursday's attack by a North Korea-linked hacker. The BTC/INR pair has fallen 22% in the last 24 hours, while on other local exchanges it's just 2% lower. The SHIB/INR pair lost 30%. Wazir's native token, WRX, is down 40% since the attack. The hacker, who drained $230 million from WazirX, converted most of the spoils into ether, according to blockchain tracker Lookonchain. The exploiter holds over 59,097 ETH as of Friday morning, worth $200 million at current prices and another $15 million in various alternative tokens.  Dozens of crypto tokens themed after internet services company CrowdStrike and the Microsoft “Blue Screen of Death” error were issued on Ethereum and Solana amid a global internet outage. Millions of Windows users worldwide are experiencing the so-called BSOD error, which causes the system to suddenly shut down or restart. The error has hit businesses ranging from airlines and railways to stock exchanges and is reportedly related to a Crowdstrike software update that went awry. No crypto-related company has yet reported errors or outages in their services. Creating tokens to profit from a trending news narrative is a niche behavior of crypto market participants. Many end up making a profit for their creators and early buyers before losing all value.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin has largely traded in a range this week amid continued Mt. Gox supply and tanking equities, with firm such as QCP Capital considering it be a sign of the market shaking off worries.  ""While spot could range here in the near term, the market is definitely betting big on a breakout heading into the US elections,"" the firm said, noting that volatility had drifted lower as BTC was back to the familiar range of $61,000 to $71,000.  FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said that certain bitcoin indicators show the asset is far from overbought and sentiment far from euphoric, leaving room for gains in the near term.

31207828,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630547,1721386849,"Solana Price Could Eclipse $1,400 As Massive Bull Flag Emerges","The Solana price has surged over 33% in the past two weeks, and according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), this could be the precursor to a much larger rally. In the weekly chart (SOL/USD), the Solana price exhibits a major bullish pattern, suggesting a potential surge beyond the $1,400 mark. Is $1,400 Next For Solana? Martinez highlighted a “bull flag” formation, a classic continuation pattern in technical analysis that could signify a significant upward movement in Solana’s value in the upcoming months. “The bull flag nobody is talking about!” Martinez commented. The chart displays a bull flag pattern, identified through a sharp upward trend followed by a consolidating downward channel. This pattern began forming after a strong price increase from mid-September last year, where Solana ascended from around $17.50 to a peak of approximately $210. Following this rise, the price began to consolidate, forming a downward sloping channel that suggests a period of accumulation and potential buyer exhaustion after the initial surge. Related Reading: $174 In Sight: Analyst Projects Major Surge For Solana (SOL) The flagpole, an essential component of the bull flag pattern, was established by the initial steep increase in price, while the flag itself is represented by the subsequent consolidation phase. This phase is depicted by a series of higher lows and lower highs, converging into a narrowing point that suggests decreasing volatility and tightening price ranges—a typical precursor to a potential price breakout. According to Martinez’ analysis, the price of Solana stands at $157.98 and thus just below the upper trendline of the channel. The consolidation has formed within a tight range, with the upper and lower boundaries clearly marked by trend lines converging towards a point on the chart projected to occur soon. The critical support level, as observed from the consolidation phase, is near the $130 mark, with the resistance level just slightly above the current price, around $160. Related Reading: Solana’s Popcat Nears $1 Billion Market Cap After Hitting ATH If the bull flag pattern holds true to its typical implications, a breakout could be expected upon reaching the apex of the converging trend lines. Historically, the projected target of a bull flag breakout is estimated by measuring the length of the flagpole—more than 1,000% in SOL’s case—and projecting it upwards from the point of breakout or from the support level (in a more conservative alternative). This calculation would position the potential price target for Solana above $1,400, according to Martinez’ chart. In the more conservative scenario, Solana could also reach at least $1,300. Key Resistance Levels For SOL On the way towards the enormous price target, there are several resistances and intermediate price targets to overcome. In the short term, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $163 is the most important. Known as the “golden ratio,” this is currently the most watched resistance. Afterwards the 0.786 Fib at $205 needs to be watched as a last major resistance before a price returns to the November 2021 all-time high at approximately $260. The Fibonacci extension levels further offer potential targets if the Solana price surpasses its original high. The 161.8% extension at $415.23 marks a significant target for initial price discovery. Subsequent levels like the 261.8% extension at $666 and the 361.8% level at $918 are crucial in a very strong trend where the price extends well beyond the initial range. Remarkably, even the 423.6% extension only predicts a rally in Solana’s price up to $1,074.

According to a spokesperson, Galaxy is acquiring the operations and engineering teams and the assets that come with those, increasing the company's serviced assets under stake by about 43%.

Traders warn of a correction in the coming days, however, which could damp short-term trading sentiment.  Trading volume in XRP flipped that of bitcoin {{BTC}} on South Korean crypto exchanges this week, one symptom of the frenzy that may have helped fuel the token’s 20% rise over the period.  Data tracked by CoinGecko shows XRP accounted for as much as 40% of trading volumes on UpBit, the country’s biggest exchange, and over 35% on Bithumb and Korbit earlier this week. That is, unusually, higher than usual leaders bitcoin and Tether's USDT, indicating a short-term demand for the tokens in the country.  Volumes also surged on global exchanges such as Binance and OKX, but did not overtake bitcoin or ether {{ETH}}. Open interest on XRP-tracked futures more than doubled earlier this week with a bias toward bullish movements, as reported.  Normal business resumed on Friday, with bitcoin's volume exceeding XRP's in South Korea amid a broader market slump that sent the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) down 1.9% in 24 hours. BTC lost 1.3% while XRP slid as much as 8%.  In crypto circles, South Korean traders are known for pushing euphoric rallies on tokens, contributing to buying pressure and possibly influencing prices.  “With daily local media coverage of XRP and influencers mentioning it, it seems that trading volume is focused on the token,” Bradley Park, a Web3 analyst at on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant, said in a Telegram message. “There seems to have been a sudden increase in trading volume as SEC-related news has been in the spotlight.”  Gains in the token started last week as traditional futures powerhouses CME and CF Benchmarks announced the debut of indices and reference rates for XRP.  On Wednesday, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a Bloomberg TV interview that he expects a “resolution very soon” on the legal dispute between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple.  These comments may have boosted market confidence in the closely related XRP token, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at crypto exchange Bitget, wrote in a message to CoinDesk on Friday. However, Lee warned of a decline ahead after the market-beating performance.  “The recent surge in XRP might trigger a technical correction, so there could be some degree of price pullback in early August.

Over the past week, the digital asset has jumped about 32%, and a measly 1% in the last day. Related Reading: Dogecoin Big Rally Ahead: Analyst Sees ‘Most Beautiful’ Chart Pattern INJ, at the time of writing, was trading at $26.17. A chance that its price will explode, going as high as $380, could be in the cards. Here, we break down the factors that have led to INJ’s great success and talk about what might happen in the future for this growing digital currency asset. Injective: Positive Patterns Given recent increases in Bitcoin, Injective’s remarkable price surge coincides with a bullish trend in the larger cryptocurrency market. The general market mood is rather optimistic, which provides a rich environment for alternative currencies like INJ to flourish. Analysts are attributing this increase to the arrival of Ethereum ETFs on July 23rd as well as favorable market circumstances. This next event is likely to intensify investor interest in the crypto market, therefore benefiting altcoins and increasing their attractiveness among investors. As more buyers flock to Ethereum ETFs and the demand for altcoins rises, they will bring new life to the market. As a result of its recent gains and overall good progress, injective is well-positioned to make money from this trend. There have been over $600 million worth of trades in bitcoin in the last 24 hours, giving it a market value of $2.44 billion.

After INJ’s price crossed a historical resistance point often indicating possible for significant upward movement, an important logarithmic level of $21.65, this pattern has developed. Marks’ examination reveals INJ’s amazing upside potential given its target price of $380. From existing trading levels, this prediction shows an amazing 1,350% rise. Excited traders and investors have responded to the Hidden Bull Divergence as they see this technical pattern as a good signal of future price rise.

31201300,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630540,1721376020,"Buying ‘Ethereum Beta’ Altcoins Is A Recipe For Disaster, Researcher Finds","In a research report released on July 18, 2024, Thor Hartvigsen, a crypto researcher, strongly cautioned against the investment strategy of purchasing high-beta altcoins within the Ethereum ecosystem as a leveraged tactic, particularly with the forthcoming launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States. Hartvigsen’s analysis titled “ETH Beta – a Recipe for Disaster?” provides an analysis of whether buying ETH-correlated altcoins, commonly referred to as ‘ETH betas,’ constitutes a good investment strategy. These assets, including tokens like OP, ARB, MANTA, MNT, METIS, GNO, CANTO, IMX, STRK (all L2’s), MKR, AAVE, SNX, FXS, LDO, PENDLE, ENS, LINK (all DeFi) PEPE, DOGE (all memes), SOL, AVAX, BNB and TON (alternative L1’s) are traditionally viewed as offering leveraged exposure to movements in Ethereum’s price, assuming a higher volatility relative to Ethereum itself. The report dissects several critical areas: price performance comparison between these altcoins and Ethereum, their correlation and beta coefficients relative to Ethereum, and their risk-adjusted returns measured by the Sharpe ratio. The researcher highlights the inherent risks and inefficiencies in banking on these altcoins for enhanced Ethereum exposure. Why Buying ‘Ethereum Beta’ Altcoins Is Generally A Bad Idea Discussing price performance, Hartvigsen points out, “The TOTAL3 (altcoin market cap) against the ETH market cap is at around 1.48. Since 2020, this chart has only been this low on a few rare occasions, signaling the outperformance of ETH against most alts.” This historical context sets a grim precedent for those hoping for altcoin outperformance concurrent with Ethereum’s growth. The researcher elaborates that despite periodic recoveries at these levels, the overarching trend has been one of decline—a troubling signal for altcoin investors. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Bullish On Ethereum ETFs Fueling Surge To Record Highs Above $5,000 “Notably, not a single L2 token has outperformed ETH YTD, with the best performing token, GNO, up 34%, whereas ETH has seen a 44% gain. Worst performers include MANTA, STRK, and CANTO, all down more than 60% this year,” Hartvigsen stated. With regard to the top alternative L1’s, AVAX is the only one down on the year vs ETH. “Of the 8 DeFi tokens in this basket, 3 have outperformed ETH, namely PENDLE (+254%), ENS (+163%) and MKR (+78%). The remaining 5 are all down on the year with FXS as the worst performer down 73%,” the researcher added. Meanwhile, memecoins have been the best bet this year so far. “This can also be seen in the performance of the largest Ethereum-native memecoins. PEPE is the largest gainer of the sample, up +708% while SHIB is up 74% and DOGE 31%,” according to Hartvigsen. The correlation section of the report digs deeper into the relationship these altcoins have with Ethereum. “The sample of altcoins has not been chosen at random but consists of tokens usually assumed to be correlated with the performance of ETH,” Hartvigsen explains. Related Reading: Trading Guru Sees Bullish Future for Ethereum, Targets $5,600 in Latest Analysis He further notes that “Correlation between ETH and ETH is obviously perfect and therefore is 100%. The alts most correlated with ETH are GNO, SNX, METIS, AAVE, and ARB.” However, despite some tokens showing a decent correlation with Ethereum, the researcher cautions that these do not necessarily guarantee similar performance outcomes, especially in this crypto cycle. In terms of beta, which measures the volatility of an asset compared to the market, the findings are telling. “From this analysis, it’s clear that only a few alts have a high beta coefficient in relation to ETH, namely PEPE, METIS, ENS, and PENDLE,” Hartvigsen states. This suggests that while certain altcoins exhibit higher volatility and thus potential for greater returns relative to Ethereum, they also carry a proportionately higher risk. The calculation of the Sharpe ratio, which provides a measure of risk-adjusted return, brings another dimension to the analysis. Hartvigsen remarks, “The Sharpe ratio calculations underscore the volatility-adjusted returns of these altcoins, which have varied significantly. This is critical as investors often overlook the increased risk these ‘ETH beta’ assets carry.” Wrapping up his findings, Hartvigsen offers a clear verdict: “Buying these altcoins as a way to get leveraged exposure to Ethereum is, in my opinion, a foolish game as you’re taking on a lot of additional risk you might not be aware of. If you’re looking for leveraged ETH exposure, simply putting on a 2x ETH long on e.g., Aave is more sensible.” He emphasizes that such a strategy ensures a 100% correlation and a beta value of 2, without the unnecessary complications. At press time, ETH traded at $3,439.

The exploit significantly impacted WazirX's liquidity and listed token prices, with the exchange's WRX token plunging 40% drop in the past 24 hours.  WazirX blamed a mismatch between a digital interface and a major crypto wallet for triggering the exploit, despite having five signers from the exchange on a wallet that stored user assets.  The North Korea-linked exploiter that drained $230 million from Indian crypto exchange WazirX has converted most of the loot to ether {{ETH}}, blockchain tracker Lookonchain said on Friday.  The exploiter holds over 59,097 ETH as of Friday morning, worth $200 million at current prices, and another $15 million in various alternative tokens.  Hackers generally convert tokens to ether to use mixing services, such as Tornado Cash, which masks transactional activity and makes it easier to launder money.  As of Friday morning, almost all tokens listed on WazirX traded at steep discounts to their global and local prices, a sign of poor liquidity and immense selling pressure.  The bitcoin/rupee-denominated trading pair was down 22% in the past 24 hours, compared to other local bourses such as CoinDCX and Zebpay where prices were down 2%. The shiba inu/rupee pair is down 30%.  WazirX’s own WRX token is down 40% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, trading volumes on the exchange rose to $8 million in the past 24 hours compared to $2.2 million on Wednesday.  WazirX was hit by a security breach in one of its multisig wallets on Thursday, causing over $100 million in shiba inu (SHIB) and $52 million in ether, among other assets, to be drained from the exchange. The stolen funds accounted for over 45% of the total reserves cited by the exchange in a June 2024 report – effectively dampening hopes of a recovery among users.  It blamed a “mismatch” between a digital interface and a major crypto wallet for eventually triggering the exploit, despite having five signers from the WazirX on a wallet that stored user assets.  “During the cyber attack, there was a mismatch between the information displayed on Liminal's interface and what was actually signed,” he exchange explained in a post. “We suspect the payload was replaced to transfer wallet control to an attacker.”  Some in the Indian crypto community, however, expressed distrust over that explanation.  “6 people there, need 4 to verify still hacked and blame game,” said Pankaj Tanwar, a popular crypto YouTuber, on X. “This mistake will damage #Crypto in India beyond imagination.”  “How is this good security?

31199277,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630489,1721372455,Shiba Inu Price Drops 10% As 5 Trillion SHIB Flood To Exchanges Following WazirX’s Exploit,"WazirX, one of India’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, suffered a security breach on Thursday that resulted in the loss of $230 million, nearly half of its reserves. The exchange referred to the incident as a “force majeure event.” However, the repercussions extend beyond WazirX alone, casting a shadow of uncertainty over Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders. Panic Sell-Off Fears Rise Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic analyzed the breach, revealing that approximately $235 million worth of various crypto assets were lost, including Shiba Inu ($96.7 million), Ethereum ($52.6 million), Polygon (MATIC) ($11 million), Pepe ($7.6 million), Tether’s USDT ($5.7 million), and Floki Inu (FLOKI) ($4.7 million). Related Reading: WazirX Exchange Releases Post-Mortem Report: Was North Korea Behind The $235M Exploit? As news of the breach spread, Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, reported a surge in people rushing to exchanges to sell their assets. Notably, over 5 trillion SHIB tokens flooded exchanges within a few hours, intensifying concerns about a potential major sell-off wave. The impact on Shiba Inu’s price was evident, with the token experiencing a sharp decline of nearly 10% following the exploit to its current trading price of $0.000017. It was also disclosed that The hacker responsible for the WazirX breach sold off $102.1 million worth of SHIB tokens, according to on-chain data firm Arkham, contributing to the downtrend. However, reports indicate that market makers such as Wintermute intervened by purchasing SHIB from decentralized exchanges (DEX) and selling it on centralized exchanges, mitigating a further price drop for the token. Shiba Inu Price Analysis In the future, the extent of the sell-off and its impact is a concern, as investors’ decisions to sell their holdings as panic mounts could further exacerbate the current downtrend. Examining the SHIB/USD daily chart reveals three significant support lines expected to impede further downward movement. The first and relatively less significant support is anticipated to be around the $0.000014 zone. This level previously marked the end of a correction in early July, followed by a recovery towards $0.000020. Should selling pressure breach this level, attention turns to the crucial 6-month support at $0.000012. SHIB bulls must hold this level to prevent a deeper decline if significant buying pressure fails to materialize. Lastly, the $0.0000092 mark represents the ultimate threshold for bullish investors in the Shiba Inu coin. A breach of this level would potentially trigger a revisit to the token’s all-time low levels. Related Reading: MOVR Bulls Assemble: Crypto Analyst Says A 2,000% Surge To $234 Is Imminent Conversely, if SHIB experiences a recovery, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), depicted as the yellow line on the SHIB/USD chart, could act as a resistance point. This resistance will come into play if bullish sentiment controls SHIB’s price action.

The long-awaited token migration will occur in less than two months and aims to kickstart Polygon’s native token expansion. MATIC saw a 7% drop following the news. Related Reading: Memecoins Reign Continues: Most Popular Narrative In Q2 – CoinGecko Report Save The Date: Polygon Token Upgrade Coming Soon The Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Polygon, revealed the highly anticipated date for its native token upgrade. Set for September 4, the initial phase will begin with the token migration from MATIC to POL. Per the announcement, POL will initially replace MATIC “as the native gas and staking token for Polygon PoS.” The upgrade went live on the testnet on July 17 to “serve as a dress rehearsal” to identify and fix potential issues before the mainnet migration. Upgrading Polygon PoS from MATIC to POL is a significant undertaking that requires the highest security possible, including robust testing. (…) A testnet migration allows users, developers, and infrastructure providers to familiarize themselves with the processes of upgrading, ensuring technical validation and minimizing disruptions during the mainnet upgrade. During the subsequent phases, the POL upgrade aims to expand Polygon’s utility as an aggregated blockchain network by providing security and “unifying liquidity and shared state across multiple chains.” Per the post, some MATIC holders may have to take certain actions for the migration depending on where they hold their tokens. POL will be automatically upgraded for MATIC holders on Polygon PoS and no action is required. Meanwhile, action is required for users on Ethereum, Polygon zkEVM, or centralized exchanges (CEXes). These holders will have to upgrade to POL through a token migration contract. MATIC Falls 7%, Is $0.4 Or $1 Next? Following the news, Polygon’s native token saw a price decline of around 7%. The token, trading at $0.54 at the time of the announcement, fell to the $0.52 price range in the next 2 hours. MATIC’s price dropped to the $0.51 support zone, currently hovering between the $0.513 and $0.518 range. This performance represents a 4% retrace in the monthly chart. However, the token exhibits green numbers in the weekly and biweekly timeframes, with a 2% increase. Additionally, MATIC registers a 34% increase in its daily activity, with a daily trading volume of $374.7 million. Some market watchers have contradictory opinions on Polygon’s native token performance. Crypto analyst The Cryptonomist shared a bearish forecast for MATIC in an X post. Per the post, the analyst highlighted that MATIC had a “beautiful breakdown” from a “large rising wedge with higher TF resistance.” This suggested to the analyst that the token will continue descending, even if a retest is possible. As a result, she suggested a price target of $0.4. Meanwhile, Zayk Charts stated that MATIC was moving inside a falling wedge pattern in the macro chart. The analyst considered that a breakout out of the bullish pattern could fuel a rally toward the $1 price range. Related Reading: FET Surges 12% Ahead Of ASI Token Merger Phase 2, Can It Hit $5? Crypto analyst Alex Clay considers MATIC to be at a “generational bottom.” Clay highlighted that the token saw a 20,000% return run after its previous 630-day-long channel accumulation. The analyst believes that MATIC’s current 1218-day-long accumulation inside a Symmetrical triangle could lead to double-digit price targets. His prediction includes hitting the $4.5, $7.1, and $9.75 resistance levels before reaching a double-digit target.

Dogecoin Whales Have Increased Their Holdings During The Past Day As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a post on X, the Dogecoin whales have participated in net accumulation in the last 24 hours. The on-chain metric of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the analytics firm Santiment which tells us about the amount of DOGE that a given wallet group is currently holding. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming A Signal That’s Usually “Very Bullish,” Analyst Says Addresses are divided into these wallet cohorts based on the number of coins they are carrying. In the context of the current discussion, the 1 million to 10 million coins group is of interest. This group naturally includes only the holders that own at least one million and at most ten million tokens of the memecoin in their balance. At the current asset price, the lower end of this range converts to around $118,000, while the upper one is equivalent to $1.18 million. Only the large holders of the DOGE network would qualify for this group. More specifically, the smaller end of the whale cohort would fall inside this range. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for these Dogecoin whales over the past few weeks: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin Supply Distribution for this cohort has increased over the last few days. This would suggest that the whales have been participating in net accumulation. During the last 24 hours alone, these investors have added more than 60 million DOGE to their wallets, worth around $7.1 million. While this amount isn’t high, the fact that the group hasn’t sold during the latest pullback in the price could be an optimistic sign for the memecoin. The timing of the buys would certainly suggest that the whales are looking at Dogecoin with a keen eye, jumping on any dip opportunities that appear, as they may end up being profitable. Related Reading: XRP Surges 39% As Sharks & Whales Push Supply Share Past 85% The indicator may be to monitor in the coming days, though, as things can sometimes quickly change, and any selloffs from these humongous investors could lead to a bearish outcome.

According to a video circulating on social media platform X, Briggs predicted XRP hitting a hefty price tag of $10,000. However, he did not give a timeline of when this would happen. This prediction comes amidst a bullish week for XRP, with the cryptocurrency currently outperforming large other market cap assets. XRP Price Explosion To $10,000 The XRP price has been subjected to various price predictions in the past months, with the majority of them coming from a technical and/or fundamental perspective. However, Brandon Briggs’ XRP prediction is different from the conventional mode of analysis crypto investors are used to. Related Reading: Bitcoin Developer Samson Mow Says BTC Will Rise To $1 Million, Here’s When According to him, the prediction was made as a direct instruction from God on which asset was the next big thing in the investment world. That is, an asset that would surge massively over the next few years and mimic the performance of Apple. Consequently, Briggs noted that God told him XRP will go from its current price level to $10,000 one day. Interestingly, Briggs explained further that he had no idea what XRP was until he had the divine revelation. “So I had to Google it, and I found out it was a cryptocurrency,” Briggs said. WOW! 💥 Brandon Biggs, recognized by many as a prophet, predicted the Trump assassination attempt 3 months ago and said this about XRP: „#XRP WILL GO TO FROM WHERE IT’S AT RIGHT NOW TO $10,000 ONE DAY!“ Video source: https://t.co/fWtDYB4SNx pic.twitter.com/yXiizNTl8a — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) July 14, 2024 How Feasible Is The Price Prediction? The XRP price recently went through a multi-day period of intense bullishness that culminated in a breakout above $0.6 again and a peak at $0.635. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5726 and is still on a 28.62% weekly gain. In order to reach a price target of $10,000, XRP would need to perform a 1754285% surge from the current price level. Furthermore, this would push XRP’s market cap into the number one spot, assuming Bitcoin doesn’t go through a similar price surge. This is because XRP has a higher maximum supply than Bitcoin. Some might agree that the XRP prediction appears a little too unrealistic, especially since it is not supported by any technical or fundamental analysis of the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, the idea of an ultra-bullish XRP surge of this nature resonates with some other XRP enthusiasts. Particularly considering Briggs’ earlier prophecy of an assassination attempt on President Donald Trump, which turned out to be correct. Briggs, however, did state in a YouTube video that the prediction is not financial advice and is just his opinion. Related Reading: PEPE Explosion Imminent: Analyst Predicts Price Will Rocket To $0.00004128 ATH According to crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, XRP will need to break above $0.65 before it can enjoy a free run to the $0.75 price level. “Anything below 0.75c is just market noise,” EGRAG said.

From a technical perspective, this development is an important step for Bitcoin to re-enter a price point that has traditionally opened the door to massive gains. Related Reading: Why Did The German Government Sell Off 50,000 Bitcoin In 2 Weeks Indicator of Market Recovery According to on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the latest swing in Bitcoin price is attempting again to retest Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price — which serves as one of the most critical sentiment indicators for understanding market directions. J. A. Maartunn, a contributor at CryptoQuant revealed that when considering the price discovery dynamic of Bitcoin, this STH realized price is truly important. For short-term holders (holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days), this is the average cost basis of all Bitcoin owned. In the past, the STH realized price has served as a reliable support level to aid the prediction of possible bounce price levels during a bull market. Currently, the Bitcoin market is going through yet another substantial test of this trendline, with recent movements hinting at a reattainment of this crucial level. Maartunn discloses that the current market behavior where Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the STH realized price is a “positive sign,” indicating a possible accumulation phase among short-term holders. The analyst also mentions that this situation typically gives birth to more buying as investors aim to average down or increase their positions at the same price they entered initially. Particularly, since early 2023, Bitcoin has reclaimed the STH realized price twice, each time followed by at least 30% gains, according to Maartuun. This suggests that as the asset has now reclaimed the STH realized price again, a substantial rally to the upside might just be on the horizon. Bitcoin Challenges and Opportunities Ahead However, it’s not all smooth sailing. Recent data from another prominent on-chain analytics firm, Glassnode, suggests several roadblocks short-term holders face. Over the past month, 66% or more of Bitcoin (BTC) holdings have now gone underwater for this group at current price levels, according to the latest report by Glassnode. That represents one of the largest deteriorations of short-term holder profitability in history, which means a lot of buyers at the top have lost a significant amount. Adding to this sentiment, Santiment has recently reported that “Bitcoin’s amount of holders (any wallets with >0 coins) have been dropping aggressively.” According to Santiment, “traders still seem to believe the March ATH was as good as it’s going to get in 2024.” Related Reading: Behind Bitcoin’s Surge Above $64,000: Here Are The Key Drivers of the Current Rally Although it’s not all grim, the market intelligence platform also revealed, “When we see mass liquidations like this, the probability of a continued rebound only increases.” 👋 Bitcoin’s amount of holders (any wallets with >0 coins) have been dropping aggressively as traders still seem to believe the March ATH was as good as it’s going to get in 2024.

31185182,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630368,1721347208,"Bitcoin Forming A Signal That’s Usually “Very Bullish,” Analyst Says","An analyst has pointed out how Bitcoin is back above the cost basis of the short-term holders, a sign that can be bullish for the asset. Bitcoin Is Back Above The Realized Price Of Short-Term Holders As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a new post on X, BTC has reclaimed the Realized Price of the short-term holders. The “Realized Price” here refers to an indicator that, in short, keeps track of the average cost basis of the investors in the Bitcoin market. When the value of this metric is greater than the cryptocurrency’s spot price, the average holder in the sector can be assumed to be carrying some unrealized profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under the BTC price implies the dominance of losses in the market. Related Reading: XRP Surges 39% As Sharks & Whales Push Supply Share Past 85% In the context of the current discussion, the Realized Price of the entire userbase isn’t of interest, but that of only a part of it: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their tokens within the past 155 days. This cohort makes up one of the two main divisions of the BTC sector based on holding time, with the other part of the market being known as the long-term holders (LTHs). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price specifically for this cohort over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot price had plunged under the Realized Price of the STHs last month, meaning that this group had gone into a state of net loss. After spending some time below the line, though, the cryptocurrency has risen above the metric with the latest rally, thus bringing this cohort back into profit. “This is usually a very bullish sign,” notes Maartunn. The chart shows that the last time the asset broke back above this level after an extended stay below it was last October. This surge back above the line kicked off a run that would eventually result in the coin setting a new all-time high (ATH). As for why BTC breaking above the STH Realized Price has historically been something bullish, the answer lies in investor psychology. The STHs, who are relatively inexperienced hands, can be sensitive to price movements. More specifically, they are likely to show a reaction when their average cost basis undergoes a retest. When these investors are bearish, they may decide to sell when the price rises to their cost basis, as they may worry that the surge won’t last. Similarly, they react by accumulating further instead during bullish periods, as they could see their cost basis as a profitable point for buying more. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: NVT Golden Cross Suggests BTC Oversold As BTC has been able to surge past this line recently, it wouldn’t appear that the STHs are offering resistance right now, and thus, a bullish sentiment is still dominant among them.
