42426291,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM5bh,1426109110,150 More MyCoin Bitcoin Scheme Victims Step Forward,"An additional 150 victims of the allegedly fraudulent bitcoin exchange MyCoin have come forward to police, according to the South China Morning Post.  Accompanied by Democratic Party legislator James To Kun-sun, 23 victims reported their involvement with the company to police on Wednesday. The development is the latest in the ongoing saga surrounding MyCoin, a platform billed as a bitcoin exchange but that may have never dealt in the digital currency.  SCMP indicated that one victim is said to have lost $HK80,000 ($102,946 at press time), a figure that may be among the highest individual totals so far reported.  Five individuals were arrested last week in connection with MyCoin, though they have been released on bail. The investigation, led by Hong Kong Commercial Crime Bureau, continues to search for individuals involved.  Notably, the report also included revised estimates of the total customer loss experienced when the scheme went offline, with the latest estimates suggesting 80 victims have so far come forward citing losses of HK$150m ($19.3m at press time).",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/11/150-more-mycoin-bitcoin-scheme-victims-step-forward,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Launched in January, the payment option was initially available in Italy, Spain and the UK, before expanding to an additional 20 countries. The payment option was enabled through a partnership with Dutch online payment provider Smart2Pay.  A spokesperson for Badoo indicated that the decision was driven by Badoo’s broader commitment to integrating new and novel technologies, stating:  “Bitcoin is relatively new and cutting-edge technology wise, which is reflective of Badoo's position as an early adopter. We wanted to be on the forefront of bitcoin adoption.”  The representative added that bitcoin’s “advantages over other payment methods”, including its low processing fees and ability to limit chargebacks, were also factors.  Bitcoin use, according to the company, has so far been on par with other alternative payment methods. As a result, it reported it is currently considering how to incentivize more users to choose bitcoin at checkout.  “There are currently no discounts or extra features available when paying with bitcoin, however this is something we will look at once we launch bitcoin globally across all Badoo platforms,” she added.  Badoo offers more than 30 payment methods to its global customer base, processing transactions in 84 currencies.

42426330,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM5th,1426093863,"Bitcoin Now Accepted by 13,000 3D Printers Worldwide","Decentralised printing network 3D Hubs has partnered with BitPay to allow customers in over 140 countries to pay using bitcoin.  The on-demand service, which connects local printers with consumers wishing to create 3D designs, has a network of more than 13,000 machines listed on its database.  When asked about his company's decision to accept bitcoin, Bram de Zwart, co-founder at 3D Hubs, said the currency's integration had been the most requested feature by the 3D Hubs community:  ""This makes sense as there is much overlap between bitcoin and 3D Hubs. They are both platforms that enable communities to change large industries with a bottom-up approach to manufacturing and payments.""  ""With this launch we are making it possible for everyone to manufacture and purchase products without traditional centralised institutions in between,"" he added.  'Perfect synergy'  Wouter Vonk, European Marketing Manager at BitPay, said 3D Hubs brought ""a disruptive technology to the masses by decentralising 3D printing"", adding that this was in ""perfect synergy with what BitPay is doing for money transfers"".  ""While we are making the physical concept of money digital, 3D Hubs is making digital concepts physical,"" he said.  The announcement comes after 3D Hubs' payment processor Adyen partnered with BitPay to provide bitcoin functionality to its clients last month.

42426295,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM5jh,1426089172,Goldman Sachs Report Says Bitcoin Could Shape 'Future of Finance',"Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are part of a technology ""megatrend"" that could change the fundamental mechanics of transactions, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs' equity research analysts.  Bitcoin, along with improved payment security, 'big data' analytics and faster payment networks are the components of a technology trend that will disrupt the payments ecosystem, the report says.  The disruption of the $1.2tn global payments industry will be also be driven by converging trends in regulation, global demographics and the rise of markets outside the United States.  The report says:  ""Innovations in network technology and cryptography could change the speed and mechanics of moving money.""  Bitcoin will change consumer payments  The report, published yesterday, is titled The Future of Finance: Redefining The Way We Pay in the Next Decade. It's written by James Schneider and SK Prasad Borra, payments analysts at the bank's research division.  It comes as the second in a series that has already featured the rise of 'shadow banks'.  According to Schneider and Borra, bitcoin's major impact will be enabling the transfer of assets without a central clearing authority.  The large public companies that will benefit will be merchants, who will reap savings on payment costs. Firms who might lose out are traditional money-transfer firms like Western Union, Moneygram and Xoom.  The report names Coinbase, BitPay and Ripple Labs as the leading firms in the bitcoin space.  Bitcoin's impact will be felt in the field of consumer-to-consumer payments, the report says. This market includes all payments made between consumers, with examples of leading vendors being mobile wallets like Venmo and Square Cash.  Disruptive entrants to the consumer payments space are limited to earning revenue from international money transfers, according to the report, a market that's worth $580bn. These entrants include bitcoin exchanges and the peer-to-peer platform for foreign currency exchange TransferWise.  Exchanges named in the report include Coinbase, itBit, Circle, Trucoin and CoinCorner.  Bitcoin could also play a significant role in global remittances for customers who want to use cash to begin the transfer process. The report points to Bitspark as an example of a firm that lets customers remit funds by depositing cash, bypassing the need for a bank account. Bitspark then performs the transfer by exchanging it into bitcoin.  New players could take 20% of the current $30bn consumer-to-consumer market from incumbents over the next 10 years, the analysts estimate. Newcomers will also drive fees down from a current average of 6% of the principal to 2.5%.  ""Distributed networks are, in principle, more secure and reliable due to their open source nature, and there is no single point of failure,"" the report notes.  ""Given the low transaction fees associated with ... virtual currencies, there is potential for significant dislocation in the profit pools associated with money transfer.""  Significant merchant interest in bitcoin  The Ripple network is highlighted as a bitcoin alternative that could gain acceptance among small banks. The report points to Ripple's partnerships with banks like Fidor, CBW Bank and Cross River Bank as evidence that the network allows these institutions to perform international money transfers without depending on large banking partners.  Merchant adoption of bitcoin could rise in coming years, the report found. The analysts conducted a survey with the Electronic Transactions Association that found 23% of merchants planned to accept bitcoin within the next 24 months.  The report estimates that more than 100,000 merchants currently take bitcoin payments globally.  The analysts stress that merchant adoption of bitcoin is in its ""infancy"" and that results so far have been inconclusive. It cites Overstock.com falling well short of its bitcoin sales target last year as an example of a merchant who is not enjoying significant benefits from bitcoin payments.  But the authors also stress that it's too early to write bitcoin off, and that they will ""closely monitor"" merchant bitcoin-use in the coming months.  The report also noted that nearly 80% of trading volume on bitcoin exchanges is driven by trade in the yuan-bitcoin currency pair, although it did not point out that Chinese exchanges often don't charge fees for trading, leading to higher trading volumes.  The opportunity for bitcoin-linked companies is tiny compared to the potential gains available in other sectors identified in the report. While $6bn could accrue to firms like bitcoin exchanges operating in the consumer-to-consumer payments space, some $17bn is up for grabs in the business-to-business payments sector.  In the field of payments between businesses and consumers, $84bn could be taken by newcomers.

42426306,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM63h,1426082204,Former JPMorgan Exec Blythe Masters Swaps Wall Street for Bitcoin,"Ex-JP Morgan Chase & Co executive Blythe Masters has joined bitcoin trading platform Digital Assets Holdings LLC as chief executive.  In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, the commodities veteran expressed her belief (paywall) that blockchain technology can restore confidence and trust in the financial markets.  Digital Assets  , founded by entrepreneurs Sunil Hirani and Don Wilson in 2014, will allow financial institutions to trade digital currencies alongside digitised assets. The platform is expected to launch later today.  Masters, the former head of global commodities at JP Morgan Chase & Co, said:  ""Digital Assets has a revolutionary technology platform that eliminates the counterparty risk and lack of transparency that has hindered mainstream adoption of cryptographic technology. The possibilities for reducing cost and risk in settlement are enormous.""  The new CEO, who is best known for her work in credit derivative products, told the WSJ that the new venture seeks to build a bridge between the emerging digital currency industry and Wall Street.  Doing so would result in something ""truly revolutionary"", she added.  Blockchain-based solution  Digital Assets will operate a decentralised wholesale settlement system in an attempt to revolutionise the traditional, centralised financial model.  The company will also provide the necessary tools to allow customers to convert traditional securities and other financial instruments into a digital form which can be written into the blockchain.  Masters told the WSJ this would mean that people could trade assets in a less costly and more efficient and secure environment.  By building a software platform that enables secure trading and settlement, Digital Assets hopes to avoid the counterparty failures which Masters says ""have plagued bitcoin and other digital assets"".  Wilson concluded:  ""The solutions Digital Asset will help scale and commercialise under Blythe's leadership have the potential to transform fundamentally how we think about the creation, settlement, tracking and transfer of assets and currencies.""  Division of opinion  According to Masters, bitcoin is neither an alternative currency nor a lucrative investment – rather ""a medium for exchange and a mechanism for recording information"".  She is not the first Wall Street banker to get into cryptocurrency. Her ex-husband, Daniel Masters, a former commodities trader at JP Morgan Chase & Co, set up the first regulated bitcoin fund, GABI, in Jersey last year.  Speaking with CoinDesk in September, Masters echoed his ex-wife's statements on the future of cryptocurrency:  ""The best scenario for bitcoin is that there is a bridge between the bitcoin world and the world of traditional finance. Unless there is a working relationship, it will just slow down the development of bitcoin dramatically.""  Despite support from two of JP Morgan's former heavyweights, not everyone at the organisation agrees on bitcoin's potential.  Jamie Dimon, the bank's chairman and CEO, has been famously dismissive of the technology: ""bitcoin developers are going to try and eat our lunch and that's fine.""

42426302,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM5zh,1426065969,Coinbase Joins Facebook and Uber in Internet Lobbying Group,"Coinbase is the first bitcoin company to join the Internet Association (IA), a Washington, DC public policy group that lobbies regulators on Internet freedom and innovation.  Launched in 2012, the IA boasts founding members including Amazon, eBay, Facebook and Google, alongside more than 40 general members including Airbnb, Lyft and Uber.  IA CEO Michael Beckerman framed the announcement as one that will find his organisation continuing its efforts to take on issues facing all disruptive Internet startups, including bitcoin-related issues that may have a wider impact.  Beckerman told CoinDesk:  ""The idea of an emerging internet technology would be discriminated against or couldn’t compete because of policy or regulatory issues, that is something all of our companies care about.""  For example, he compared the struggles faced by Coinbase and the bitcoin industry at large to those his firm is helping ridesharing firms and cloud companies to overcome.  John Collins, head of government affairs at Coinbase, cited IA’s role in helping regulators adapt outdated laws as a key factor behind the company's decision to join the organisation.  ""We’re investing a lot in helping policy makers to set the policies of decentralized networks, like the bitcoin protocol,"" Collins said. ""That’s something that IA has a lot of experience in and we think they can help us.""  Collins did not outline any specific issues Coinbase may be looking to take up as an IA member.  Beckerman added that he considers IA to be ""very selective"" in recruiting members, and that Coinbase was chosen for its willingness to be a productive part of the conversation surrounding the Internet today.
