Considering that crypto is becoming mainstream, understanding the market through daily analytics is vital for successful cryptocurrency investors. As such, platforms that assist in aggregating the cryptocurrency market data are becoming essential sources of information. It&apos;s done through tracking data movement of prices, exchange trading volumes, listed coins, trading pairs, and the state of the crypto market. These analytics platforms keep adding new metrics as well as refining existing ones. Among the leading crypto market analytics platforms are CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. Both serve a common purpose. However, they exhibit different features that favor different kinds of investors in the cryptocurrency industry. Keeping that in mind, this article breaks down the major differences between the two leading crypto analytics platforms; CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin and other major cryptos see green  Bitcoin and other major cryptos were largely in the green late Tuesday as the market continued to solidify, but the small surge seemed more a temporary reprieve than sea change in bearish sentiment that intensified last week during the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin implosion.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading over $30,400, a more than 1% gain over the past 24 hours. Ether was up about 3% during the same period, maintaining its most frequent, recent perch above $2,000. ALGO and MATIC each rose over 7%. SOL, CRO and ADA recovered from midday drops and were up about 4%.  ""The crash of [Terra’s] UST stablecoin has heralded the end of a momentous bull run,"" Yield App CEO and founder Tim Frost wrote in an email. ""The market is 54% below"" its ""all-time high and won’t be climbing far any time soon as we face what looks set to be a painfully prolonged bear market.""  Cryptos traced equity markets, which rose amid encouraging U.S. retail spending and industrial production reports and cautiously optimistic remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The tech-focused Nasdaq jumped 2.7%, while the the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2% and 1.3%, respectively.  The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday that retail sales had risen 0.9% in April, the fourth consecutive monthly increase and evidence that surging inflation has not completely damped consumers' appetites for goods and services. The report noted increased spending on electronics, cars and clothing, even as consumers spent less on gas, which has been a primary source of the recent months' cost run-ups. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said industrial production rose 1.1% in April, also its fourth straight monthly gain.  In remarks at The Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything Festival on Tuesday, Powell called “restoring price stability a nonnegotiable need."" ""It is something we have to do,"" he said, adding that he was hopeful the Fed could tame inflation without triggering huge increases in unemployment or a deep recession. ""It is a challenging task, made more challenging the last couple months because of global events,” Powell said. “It is challenging because unemployment is very low already and because inflation is very high.”  Yield App's Frost said the collapse of UST was ""nothing short of harrowing.""  ""Any thorough due diligence assessment would have revealed that this asset could not withstand a bank run,"" he wrote. ""And withstand a bank run it truly did not.""  Still, he added optimistically that other protocols would learn from the ""UST disaster, lessons that will use the resulting bear market to develop the next generation of decentralized finance products. When we enter the next bull run, the fruits of their labor will be the world’s new financial system.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,882 +2%  DJIA: 32,654 +1.3%  Nasdaq: 11,984 +2.7%  Gold: $1,814 -0.6%  Insights  Investors change their stablecoin preferences  LUNA and UST’s collapse is still reverberating through the broader crypto market. Bitcoin has fallen significantly in recent months and is now seemingly stuck around the $30,000 mark.  The most significant impact on the market isn’t an evisceration of crypto pricing from the start of the year, a trend that the collapse accelerated, but rather a brewing crisis of confidence in the stablecoin sector.  Data from Glassnode shows an inverse relationship between issuances of tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC) as well as Binance USD (BUSD). Tether tokens are exiting circulation via redemption (being exchanged for cash) while more USDC and BUSD are being issued because of demand.     “The redemptions of USDT were around $7.5 billion, whilst the supply of USDC grew by $2.64 billion and BUSD by $1 billion. So all in all we had around $3.64 billion in supply expansion, and $7.5 billion in contraction, meaning a net outflow of $3.76 billion,” James Check, an analyst at Glassnode, wrote to CoinDesk in an email.  DAI, another algorithmic stablecoin but structured differently than UST, also saw a decline in circulating supply by 24.4%, as $2.067 billion was burned.  “What we are potentially watching is a changing preference for which stablecoins the market prefers,” Check said.  Check suspects a large trader or traders used the momentum of the ""UST depeg"" narrative to lean on the USDT peg in the hopes it would generate downside fear, which he believes it did.  “We saw the distressed sale of the [Luna Foundation Guard’s] 80K BTC, and then a few days later, USDT pairs on some exchanges come under pressure, making for a perfect storm for a sophisticated short side trade,” he said.  But it’s important to note that despite all this, the USDT dollar peg quickly recovered. A large, rapid volume of redemptions happened in a short time, and the system kept functioning.  “As stablecoins become increasingly integrated as base layer infrastructure in the market, the shockwaves of a de-pegging event, especially in the largest stablecoin USDT will have widespread impacts,” Check wrote in a note published last week. “This event will also no doubt attract the regulatory spotlight at a greater pace and urgency.”  USDC has a long way to go before it ever has a change of ""flippening"" tether. But the data can’t be ignored: With a crisis of confidence brewing for stablecoins, it’s USDC (and BUSD) that the traders want, not tether.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Rises to $30K; Resistance at $35K  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade around $30,000, which is near the bottom of a year-long price range. The cryptocurrency appears to be stabilizing, although resistance at $33,000 and $35,000 could stall an upswing in price.  BTC was roughly flat over the past 24 hours and is down by 24% over the past 30 days. The recent sell-off extended bitcoin's short-term downtrend despite oversold conditions on the chart.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from oversold levels, reached on May 12 when BTC declined toward $25,300. Typically, oversold signals precede a price bounce, similar to what occurred in late January.  Further, on the daily chart, BTC on track to register a positive momentum signal, per the MACD indicator for the first time since late March. Still, momentum signals remain negative on the weekly and monthly charts, which suggests limited upside from here.

That is faster than the internet adoption rate during its heydays in the 90s and early 2000s. Widespread global penetration has, however, proven to be quite elusive. Could people be courting the wrong ideas and expectations of how universal crypto adoption should occur? Could there be other unexpected ways in which universal adoption will be achieved? Read on to learn the five unexpected crypto adoption ways that make it go universal. Web 3.0 According to Worldbank data, the global internet penetration rate stood at 60% in 2020. The number of internet users has averaged a growth of 10% since 2005. All the current internet usage is based on the second generation of the worldwide web (Web 2.0), with all the current big tech firms. Web 3.0 can best be defined as the next evolution of the internet and the third generation of the world wide web. It aims to develop a more intelligent and better-connected browsing experience for users. It will employ machine-based deep learning of data based on concepts such as decentralization and token economics. In short, blockchain technology and crypto tokens based on Decentralized Finance will form the basic building blocks of how everyone browses the internet in the future.

The coin is up 155 percent, reversing from $0.03 and likely to clear April 2022 highs as the token bottoms up from all-time lows. Past Performance IDEX is spearheading the recovery, reading from the performance in the daily chart. After posting worrying dumps in early May 2022, pushing the token to new all-time lows, the recovery is on. Currently, IDEX is up an impressive 155 percent against the USDT, bouncing from around $0.04. IDEX Technical Analysis From the IDEXUSDT technical analysis, buyers have the upper hand. Notably, the surge of May 17 is with high trading volumes. This expansion confirms the bullish engulfing bar of May 13, which closed below the lower BB, pointing to undervaluation. Based on this candlestick arrangement, buyers may look to double down on every pullback, targeting April 2022 highs of $0.20. If bulls double down, breaking above $0.20, the coin could surge to $0.30, marking Q1 2022 highs. What to Expect from IDEX? Buyers are back in control, reversing the losses of early May.

42423320,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YIJh,1652818856,Market Wrap: Cryptos and Stocks Mixed Amid Bearish Sentiment,"Bitcoin (BTC) struggled to make a decisive move above or below $30,000 on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency appears to be stabilizing, although sentiment among traders remains bearish.  Some alternative cryptos (altcoins) underperformed bitcoin on Tuesday, which indicates a lower appetite for risk among short-term traders. For example, Decentraland's MANA token was down by 3% over the past 24 hours, compared with BTC's flat performance over the same period. Still, some alts gained on Tuesday such as Litecoin's LTC, which was up by 4%.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Stocks were also mixed on Tuesday while the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a popular measure of the stock market's expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options, has declined for four consecutive trading sessions.  Further, from a technical perspective, global equity markets appear to be oversold with initial signs of downside exhaustion, which could keep short-term buyers active over the next week. A similar set-up appeared on bitcoin's daily chart, so long as the $30,000 price level is maintained.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $30,077, +1.81%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,045, +1.99%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,089, +2.02%    ●Gold: $1,814 per troy ounce, +0.04%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.97%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Realized losses add up  Last week's sell-off triggered a spike in realized losses among bitcoin holders.  The chart below shows the realized loss metric relative to the realized market cap, which reached its highest level since the crypto sell-off in May of last year. Typically, a spike in losses occurs during the beginning or late stage of a bear market, similar to 2018 and 2019.  A loss occurs when BTC's market price falls below the average bitcoin holders' cost basis, which is recorded on the blockchain. The realized price (aggregate cost basis) is calculated by dividing the sum of all coin values at the time when they were last moved, by the circulating supply, according to Glassnode.  Currently, the realized price is around $23,000 and $24,000, which could be an important support level for BTC. In previous bear market cycles, however, BTC can trade below the realized price for about 100 days before buyers start to accumulate long positions.  Blockchain data also shows strong buying activity around the $30,000 price level in BTC.  Still, longer-term metrics suggest new buying could be short-lived until the bearish cycle reaches a trough. For example, the chart below shows a z-score of BTC's market value relative to its realized value, or the value paid for all BTC in existence (MVRV). It's essentially a measure of bitcoin's ""fair value,"" and is not at an extreme low, which typically coincides with the end of a bear market.

The &apos;fear and greed index&apos; is an indicator that tells us about the general market sentiment among Bitcoin investors right now. The metric displays this sentiment using a numeric scale that runs from one to hundred. All values of the index above &apos;50&apos; imply a sentiment of greed, while all those below the cutoff indicate a fearful market. When the indicator has values towards the end of the range, that is, above 75 or below 25, the market is in a state of extreme greed or extreme fear. Some investors believe that it&apos;s best to buy when the market is extremely fearful as bottoms have historically tended to happen during such periods.

Big banks like the ones who participated in Elwood’s Series A raise – Goldman Sachs (GS), Barclays (BCS) and Commerzbank’s CommerzVentures – need to hold cryptocurrencies at arms length for now, which means not holding the underlying asset itself but gaining exposure via futures and options contracts.  “There’s a huge focus on derivatives,” said Elwood CEO James Stickland in an interview. “It’s a great way for tier one banks to get involved in a synthetic nature without having to hold the underlying. Actually, there are huge margins and spreads to be made in the derivatives space, and the traders that are coming from those institutional houses are very used to that asset class, so they can deploy similar strategies.”  Read more: Crypto Hedge Fund Elwood Closes $70M Funding Led by Goldman Sachs and Dawn Capital  Out of the banks backing Elwood, Goldman is the most advanced, having been among the fist on Wall Street to start trading bitcoin futures. Commerzbank became the first big German bank to move towards hands on crypto adoption, announcing that it had applied earlier this year for a license to custody crypto assets from BaFin, Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority.  “In the field of digital assets, Commerzbank wants to help shape emerging digital ecosystems, especially with regard to custody and trading in non-physical assets,” a spokesman for the bank told CoinDesk via email. “We are pursuing our own digital asset strategy and are also planning our own offerings for our customers in the coming years. The future offer is initially aimed at institutional customers.”  Barclays fan club  Barclays is not yet following the likes of Goldman and Citi (C) offering crypto derivatives trading, but has a long history of working with permissioned blockchain tech to handle tokenized financial instruments. Barclays also provided banking services to Coinbase (COIN) for a period of time back in 2019.  Barclays said it could not comment on digital assets specifically, but a spokesperson told CoinDesk via email that the bank was happy to join the round and supports the build-out of regulatory compliant infrastructure for this new asset class.  Elwood’s Stickland said he is a “huge fan of Barclays,” and not just because of the U.K. connection.  “The markets team has been very thoughtful about getting involved in digital assets,” Stickland said. “Getting involved in the infrastructure is the best way to feed the foundations of this asset class. As we evolve the technology and the whole asset group in general, it’s going to be essential that we have players like Barclays involved.”  Elwood’s focus on institutional and synthetic crypto products perhaps stands in contrast to many other crypto trading firms, especially in places like Switzerland, where the current trajectory is towards non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi).  “We will do a little bit in that space to allow people a central portfolio to manage all their digital assets,” he said. “We will also support the tokenization of real estate and the tokenization of other asset classes.”  Fear and uncertainty  Given the current climate across crypto markets, a flight to the safety of things like derivatives will attract institutional players, Stickland said.  “I think there’s gonna be a huge amount of derivatives action, where there’s certainly makers and takers still, which obviously drive a huge amount of flow,” he said. “When the derivatives flow starts bubbling, it will drive buying and selling of the underlying assets.”  Looking ahead, murmurs of a crypto winter are probably premature, Stickland added:  “The reality is if you bought in over those last 12 months then, yes, you might be under water. But equally there’s an opportunity to add value and buy the dip and double up and keep driving the market up. The reality is people are still invested in the asset class.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/17/elwood-technologies-touts-strong-focus-on-crypto-derivatives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11189e65bd81a53f339ecc24aefad08e047ac00a-979x1024.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Accurate decision-making relies on informed predictions of asset values in the crypto space. In order to make more strategic and structured decisions on crypto investment, using the Stock-to-Flow model comes in handy. The Stock-to-Flow model is an investment strategy that measures the current stock of an asset against the production rate or total amounts mined over a year. To be more precise, the S2F model compares an asset&apos;s scarcity or relative abundance. A Small Dive into Stock-to-Flow Model Applications The model measures various commodity values, including natural resources such as silver or gold. These are referred to as store-of-value resources, and in theory, they retain their values over long periods due to low flow and scarcity. There are numerous advantages that investors can get from using the Stock-to-Flow model. BTC S2F model uses live chart data that easily tracks predicted asset prices at a certain time and their actual price at the same period. It is also a time series model since the data points indexed are in accordance with time. Bitcoin&apos;s S2F Model The Stock-to-Flow model of Bitcoin uses live chart data in tracking the asset&apos;s price across various periods. The line chart plots the BTC price across the chart and, in turn, creates a comparative view of Bitcoin&apos;s price forecast vs. its market price.

The summary covers the world of Web 3 – a term the firm uses to describe its vision for the future of the internet and also its regulatory ambitions.  It’s a positive report. In 56 pages, a16z (the 16 referring to the number of letters that separate the A in Andreessen and the Z in Horowitz) presents the case that the revolution is just starting. That is even if crypto is staring down a bear market.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Web 3 is a term that has been in use for years, but has recently been criticized for a lack of clarity. Gavin Wood, one of the co-founders of the Ethereum blockchain, is often said to have coined the term to describe a crypto-based web.  For a16z, the term covers everything from NFTs (non-fungible tokens), DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) and crypto gaming to actual blockchains like Ethereum and Solana and their scaling tools.  A16z has a complicated relationship with the crypto industry. One of the first venture firms active in the sector, it more than doubled its investment efforts over the recent bull run. It launched a $2.2 billion crypto fund last year and has made investments in familiar and unfamiliar projects. It holds tokens, and it is big and blockchain agnostic.  Some see venture capital as crypto’s lifeline, especially as the markets turn south. But other, hardcore crypto natives see the presence of institutions like Andreessen Horowitz as contradicting the subversive aims of crypto. Web 3 may be open for all, but that may not mean much if you’re a16z’s exit liquidity.  In some sense, there’s very little that’s new in a16z’s report. It presents up-to-date data, for instance, on how many Ethereum users there are and how many DAO governance votes have been cast, but it largely stays within the realm of well-traversed “narratives.”  Crypto is good, the firm says, because it's an alternative financial system to the current banking status quo that excludes 1.7 billion people worldwide. The firm raises that point in an overview of the report, summarizing that “crypto is having a real-world impact.”  Web 3 is a turning point, a16z says, a natural continuation of the web’s evolution from “write only” to “read and write” websites.” Said differently, the primitive “world wide web” allowed people to read information online, Web 2.0 let people create content, and Web 3 allows people to “own a piece of the internet,” the report says.  See also: 'We Blew It.' Douglas Rushkoff's Take on the Future of the Web  Digital assets may be volatile, the firms say, but that’s a positive attribute. “There is an underlying logic at work” for crypto markets where prices are “leading indicators” for technological adoption.  The price hook  “Prices are a hook. The numbers drive interest, which drives ideas and activity, which in turn drives innovation,” a16z writes. That process, called “the price-innovation cycle,” was first described in 2020.  You can’t fault a capitalist enterprise for saying something like that. Although a16z has pretensions of investing in builders of a better world, it’s fair to say it is primarily looking to turn a profit.  And in many ways, the data presented shows how crypto could be a sound investment. DeFi, or decentralized finance, would “represent the 31st-largest U.S. bank by total assets under management” after just two years, a16z said.  NFTs offer similar potential for crypto and are driving innovation around crowdfunding models, royalties and intellectual property issues. The same could be said for the gaming industry or the metaverse. “We are just beginning to see the potential,” a16z writes.  That said, the “State of Crypto” report “should not be construed as or relied upon in any manner as investment, legal, tax or other advice,” a16z discloses. The “views are “purely for “informational purposes.”  Who is this report for then?  A16z is courting legislators and regulators to present what could be called lenient rules for the crypto market. But the report doesn’t discuss those efforts or touch on the knotty regulatory issues that surround crypto.  The report also excludes mention of bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, and so it doesn’t address the entire digital asset industry. Although many investors think bitcoin is still a good investment, it’s not a sure way to make profit – even if some bitcoiners think all assets will depreciate against the hard-capped, highly memetic currency.  Web 3’s key innovation is that it allows anyone to invest in aspects of it. Crypto’s markets, open 24/7 to anyone with an internet connection, are fundamentally different from the private funding rounds a16z led into Web 2 giants like Facebook over a decade ago.  See also: Is 'Meta' Already Giving Up on the Metaverse? | The Node  There’s indication that the industry is growing sustainably. A16z cites CoinMarketCap, GitHub, Pitchbook, Twitter and others to show how there are millions of developers and “active users” across different blockchains. (Notably, Solana apparently has three times as many active addresses, 15 million, as the Ethereum layer 1, so take the figures with a grain of salt.)  “[T]hough it’s very hard to estimate, if the trendlines continue as depicted, web3 could reach 1 billion users by 2031,” the venture firm writes. I don’t know what crypto would look like with 1 billion users. It’s not unreasonable to say that as currently designed, these systems would be super expensive and may buckle under that strain.  Of course, no one knows where the industry is heading. That’s especially true as rising interest rates and inflation could drive capital out of the riskiest markets. As a statement of fact, the report is an interesting, if expected, view into the “state of crypto.” But it’s definitely not investment advice.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/17/what-web-3-means-to-andreessen-horowitz,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bdea1e9a6eea9666925c81c3c0ebce5153ab341a-1200x792.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ape Board lists over 375 protocols across 33 blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana and Polygon.  Terms of the deal were not disclosed. A Nansen spokesperson told CoinDesk the amount paid is in ""eight figures,"" putting it upward of $10 million.  With the acquisition, Nansen will be aiming to offer a broader view of the investment landscape in DeFi, which has surged in the past year. While total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols has tumbled about 40% to $113 billion since the start of the month, it's still six times higher than at the start of 2021, according to tracking service DeFiLlama.  Nansen will expand its platform to incorporate portfolio tracking, programmatic access to on-chain data and Web 3-native communication, according to an announcement Tuesday.  The two firms say Ape Board's multichain coverage will provide traders with a holistic view of the market that does not require them to use multiple platforms to track their holdings and analyze the market.  Nansen plans to combine its analytics with Ape Board's portfolio tracking to make for an ""all-in-one super app,"" the spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Ape Board's founder, Mike Phulsuksombati, said the acquisition will ""supercharge"" both products.

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev teased the “Web 3 crypto wallet” at the Permissionless conference in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday. Its announcement follows last month’s launch of a more tightly controlled crypto wallet, which was basically a halfway house for users moving tokens in and out of their Robinhood brokerage accounts.  Users of the entirely separate Web 3 wallet will be able to lend, stake, yield farm and even buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – much as they might with a MetaMask wallet. Those capabilities do not exist in Robinhood’s earlier wallet. It was not immediately clear which blockchain the custodial wallet intends to support.  Robinhood’s upcoming wallet – it begins testing in the summer, with a waitlist now open – is slated for direct competition with Coinbase’s (COIN) own offering, with expanded features announced Monday. Both investing giants are making it easier for their crypto-trading customers to actually deploy assets into DeFi without leaving their wallet ecosystems. Doing so could end up goosing DeFi protocols with a raft of new users.  While Coinbase’s Web 3 wallet is integrated, Robinhood’s is not. Robinhood Crypto Chief Technology Officer Johann Kerbrat said the new wallet will specifically cater to users who seek “advanced use cases” of crypto.  “We see this new product as a kind of brother for Web 3,” Kerbrat told CoinDesk in a phone interview prior to Tenev’s keynote. He said the team is “building this product as effectively a browser.”  The wallet will allow users to purchase and store NFTs, earn yield on assets, and access a host of tokens not currently available on Robinhood.  “We want to give [users] the last piece missing to access the Web 3 space,” said Kerbrat.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/17/robinhood-plans-web-3-crypto-wallet-for-defi-traders-nft-buyers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7547604cb800003222716e46b069b6121ee4083a-1500x926.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Because crypto mining machines, particularly Bitcoin, consume a significant amount of energy, it was only a matter of time before mining businesses began searching for alternative, less expensive sources of electricity. As a result, a logical question emerges: what kinds of resources can be used to produce such enormous quantities of electricity? To reduce the concern of environmental impacts, it is vital to make the transition to the use of renewable energy sources in order to provide this much-needed electrical power. Another option is to generate energy from waste from other industries, which is where flared natural gas comes into the picture. Is this the next energy source for Bitcoin miners? Flared natural gas as an alternative energy source Oil and gas companies have spent years trying to find a solution to the problem of what to do in the event that they strike a natural gas formation by accident while drilling for oil.

According to Bukele, among the countries attending are Paraguay, Haiti, Honduras, Costa Rica and Ecuador in Latin America; Angola, Ghana, Namibia and Uganda in Africa; and Bangladesh, Palestine and Pakistan in Asia.  The AFI has reconvened its in-person meetings following two years of the pandemic, and is currently holding annual meetings for its Digital Financial Services Working Group and the Small and Medium Enterprise Finance Working Group in El Salvador, according to the AFI.  “El Salvador, which joined the AFI network in 2012, has made significant progress in harnessing digital financial services to advance financial inclusion for individuals and small businesses,” Eliki Boletawa, AFI’s policy programs and implementation director, said in a statement.  El Salvador's attempt to promote bitcoin among developing countries comes amid a dispute with the International Monetary Fund, which in January recommended the Central American country to discontinue the use of bitcoin as a legal tender because of the financial risks and liabilities it created.

The result of this had been more investors going after the pegs of other stablecoins such as USDT and trying to see if they can destabilize the coin. Most prominent of this had been Tether USD, whose peg saw the most opposition as its peg to the U.S. dollar was heavily challenged. This challenge suggests that there could be more volatility coming. Tether Challenge Ramps Up One thing to note is that periods of challenges like these are mostly arising from periods of extreme market stress and liquidations. Such were the market conditions for the last week after the UST de-pegging. This ultimately leads to large deviations in the price of stablecoins such as USDT and USDC when it comes to the $1 peg. Although in this case, the majority of the deviations were recorded in USDT alone as USDC held up better in the market.

Ethereum May Fall 80% The trader believes Ethereum, which is presently trading at $2,000, is about to break through the support zone and will most likely fall below $420. Roque drew attention to a price range in which $3,580 is the top and $2,000 is the bottom. With Ether falling below $2,000, it is no longer within the previously specified range and will begin to fall to the next significant chart support at around $420. Source: 22v Research Because the second-largest cryptocurrency is rapidly losing value, it has fallen below all moving averages, including the 50-, 100-, and 200-day lines. The above-mentioned indicators&apos; downward movement is a significant bearish factor for any asset. Ethereum is also oversold on both the weekly and daily charts, according to Roque, which is why it cannot rally in the foreseeable future. ETH/USD trades aroun $2k.

This is because token prices are rapidly rising and there is growing confidence that regulations will be eliminated. Nevertheless, the crypto market has never been able to break free from its ties to equities and gold. Experts believe that the market will expand over time and that as it expands, various crypto themes will evolve on their own. They are bullish on smart contracts and utility tokens because of DeFi, Metaverse, and NFTs.

In these 3D spaces of the metaverse, people will be able to work, meet, play games, and communicate with one another.

42417155,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3qP,1652799987,Pierina Merino: Rethinking Social Media for the Metaverse,"For Pierina Merino, getting out of Venezuela was a no-brainer.  Aged 16, she had finished her high school studies in her home town of Ciudad Bolívar. But, with the country in a spiral of economic crisis and violence, she couldn’t celebrate. Merino’s family was understandably paranoid about safety concerns and so she didn’t even attend her own graduation ceremony.  “It was a situation in Venezuela where there was full-on chaos – life or death and there wasn’t a separation between the two,” she said.  “I wanted to go to architecture school at some point, but in a country that was going downhill, thinking about becoming an architect didn’t make any sense.”  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  She left to pursue her dream. Now, still only 30, Merino has realized not just her architectural ambition but a great deal more. She has found success with innovative jewelry design and, more recently, the creation of FlickPlay, a social metaverse platform which might just be the Next Big Thing.  “It feels like everything is coming full circle,” she said. “Did I know that things would be so aligned as a story line? Absolutely not.”  Story lines and storytelling frequently are important to Merino, particularly when discussing Flickplay, which she describes, for simplicity’s sake, as “a cross between TikTok and Pokemon Go.”  With FlickPlay’s augmented reality (AR) filters, users navigate through real cities using an interactive map on which they can find non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital collectibles (or “Flicks”) in physical locations, in the form of objects and wearables. Artworks, for example, might be found and collected from walls or other spaces. Users create videos on which they can brandish their NFTs and Flicks, building their social status through likes, comments and the earning of FlickCoins, the in-app currency. A “Social Graph” displays the social and ownership history of NFTs and Flicks on the platform.  “I can confidently say that we are the first social ecosystem where core ownership is the fundamental driver of status,” said Merino.  “Our thesis is that, in order to truly be the metaverse in the real world, you need to penetrate every layer of our cities and society and how they work together and coexist with each other.”  The user’s avatar is Flicky, a goggle-eyed chameleon who can be dressed, modified and colored according to taste. He even has his own origin myth, which explains that he was sent to this planet from elsewhere in the universe to observe humans: “During a technology revolution on Earth, a group of innovators discovered Flicky camouflaging with one of the walls in their studio. They were experimenting with a new device that utilized AR, and in uncovering Flicky they came to know of Flickverse, a different dimension in our world.”  So far, around three dozen U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami and New York, have signed agreements allowing the gamified app to overlay its metaverse world on their streets. With 23 employees, FlickPlay has so far raised $6.3 million, and over 90,000 people signed up for a raffle offering a chance to “mint a Flicky” via metaverse platform The Sandbox, with which it signed a partnership in April allowing players to use a blockchain asset on both platforms. Meanwhile, Katy Perry’s “mocktail” brand De Soi is also in on the action, offering its nonalcoholic drinks to consumers who collect NFTs while playing FlickPlay.  When Nicole Quinn of Lightspeed Venture Partners announced her company’s investment in FlickPlay last year, she described it as a “genre-defining social app.”  “What Snap’s lenses did for selfies, FlickPlay intends to do for the rest of the world,” she wrote.  Merino comes from an immigrant family. Her father’s parents were Spanish and her maternal grandfather, who was Sicilian, had a particularly dramatic rags-to-riches story. He migrated to Venezuela in the 1950s as a teenager, and after working as a miner, he eventually became a successful entrepreneur in the hospitality industry. Merino is acutely aware of how his story has informed her own career.  “When I was old enough to learn about the things he had accomplished in Venezuela it was pretty incredible because he comes from nothing,” she said. “He managed to build a massive hotel in our home town and really build his reputation as an incredible operator who was respected professionally but also as a human. That was incredibly inspiring.”  Her own parents have continued to work in hospitality and tourism, and they were keen that their three children (Merino has a brother and sister) should travel from an early age.  “We always had in mind the idea that our children should be educated abroad in order to give them a bigger vision of the world, to be more tolerant,” said Merino’s father, Yuri. “And, if they returned to Venezuela, to do so with a slightly different perspective.”  Merino’s departure after high school was made more urgent by the economic turmoil and soaring crime rate that Venezuela was experiencing under the leadership of leftist firebrand Hugo Chávez. At around that time, her aunt was kidnapped – a common occurrence in the country in recent years – before eventually being released.  “We didn’t want our children to live like that, in a country where there was so much lack of safety, so many political problems and constant danger,” said Yuri Merino.  Carlos Adame, CEO and co-founder of Piñata Farms, is a close friend of Merino. Her migrant background, he believes, has been key in motivating her professionally.  “One of the mindsets that I’ve found the strongest in entrepreneurs, when I invest in startups and also identify them, is those that have the mentality that they’ve burned all the boats, there’s no going back,” he said.  “You’re thinking very strategically and in the moment on a daily basis. It’s not like: ‘If this works out, cool, this is fun.’ No, it’s like: ‘I have to make this win.’ And she has that, so I think that’s a huge, huge plus for her.”  Merino traveled first to Montreal, where she continued her education with the aim of becoming an architect. After moving to Miami to do a foundation course, she secured a place at the prestigious Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc). When she was about to graduate, an acquaintance suggested she apply for a place at the studio of Frank Gehry, a legendary figure in the industry. Days later, aged 20, she was working in his Los Angeles headquarters.  “I got my dream job,” she said. “I got the job that people go to grad school and work for five years to aspire to.”  Gehry was perhaps best known as the creator of the dreamlike titanium-coated Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. And fittingly, for someone who would end up so squarely in the tech world, Merino was part of the team commissioned with designing Facebook’s new offices, in Menlo Park, California.  “At the end of the day you go to work for Frank Gehry because you want to build what’s impossible to build, you want the challenge of creating things that are not tangibly possible,” she said.  Looking back on her stint working for Gehry, she sees the values and disciplines learned in his studio as ultimately being a crucial ingredient in her current approach to the world of social media, AR and gaming.  “In the technology space you have a community of developers and creators trying to push the boundaries of digital worlds or technology,” she explained. “But [unlike architects] they don’t really understand how humans interact in the real world, what creates emotion, how a space that is one foot higher or one foot lower can completely change your perception or emotions or the actions that you will take in that space.”  And yet, 2 1/2 years after landing her dream job, Merino moved on. Her entrepreneurial antennae were up, starting to sense opportunities that were alien to the rarefied world of building design. It began as she watched architectural project models that had cost thousands of dollars and enormous effort to create being thrown out once they had served their purpose.  “I was like ‘Oh my God, these are pieces of art that could be sold!,’” she recalled. “And after the presentation it goes to the dumpster. And you’re like ‘What? This is crazy!’ So I feel like I genuinely had this entrepreneurial drive.”  She added, by way of explanation for her departure from the firm: “Architects are like a cult, there is a very specific way of living and being when you are a part of that ecosystem.”  On leaving Gehry’s studio, Merino started designing 3D-printed jewelry under the name Piemer (as in Pie-rina Mer-ino). It started out as a small-scale venture. But a chance encounter with a national buyer from the Nordstrom department store in an elevator during a sales event suddenly changed everything.  “She gave me her card,” recalled Merino. “And a month later we were doing a national product placement in over 30 stores.”  By her own admission, she knew nothing about manufacturing for a national chain and so had to learn on the hoof – a skill that would stand her in good stead when she made her next move.  “I’d say the inception for FlickPlay really happened the moment that I started traveling to all these different stores and realizing that … I wasn’t talking with my customer but with their moms and grandmothers who were going there because, I don’t know, they were walking around on a Monday at 10 a.m. in the mall and they were saying to me ‘Can you send these to my granddaughter’s dorm?’”  Seeing how young people had abandoned the malls got Merino thinking about broader human behavior and – in a nod to her architectural background – changes in where in cities people choose to spend their time.  Adame has advised her since those early days in the tech world, when FlickPlay was just an idea.  “She stepped into this crazy world of startups and tech, and nobody knew her in LA,” he said. “She didn’t have a reputation and she just grinded. I remember in those early days she had all these odds stacked against her, and she was like: ‘I’m going to be going out to every single event, anything where I can just meet people, I’ve just got to meet people.’”  He added: “Her aim was: ‘I just need to start acquiring information, figuring out how this space works and what better way than to just throw myself in the fire?’”  Thomas Vu, an executive producer for Netflix series “Arcane,” was an early investor. He met Merino during a sponsored skiing trip to Mammoth Mountain for promising entrepreneurs, but at first he wasn’t convinced about FlickPlay.  “Initially, when I met her, I was scratching my head because she had no co-founders, no team. And I’m like: ‘How is she going to build this?’ What she’s building is not easy and … she had nothing. Initially I was like: ‘I don’t know if I can invest in this.’”  But he discovered that Merino learned fast.  “And then, out of nowhere she just starts hiring and she convinces the right kinds of people,” Vu recalled. “And four months afterwards it was woah! She’d manifested a number of things that checked the boxes for me.”  Merino often refers to psychology when explaining FlickPlay. She says the app’s success rests on the fundamental sources of status for humans in the real world: community, popularity and ownership. Facebook connected us, she points out, and Instagram allowed us to increase our popularity. But the human hunger for ownership, according to her theory, is yet to be fully sated in the digital world.  When Merino started “obsessing” in late 2017 and 2018 about social media and digital platforms, she felt a shift was already taking place with immersive games like Pokemon Go and Fortnite, and the interactive experiences offered by Museum of Ice Cream, all of which offered what she calls “a way to architect your reality.”  FlickPlay, she said, was a natural next step, even though it took a while for the real world to catch on.  “Now it makes sense because of the NFT space and blockchain and awareness of what the metaverse is,” she said. “But two years ago, when I started FlickPlay, the idea of creating a platform around identity, based on things that you own digitally … not many people understood the why.”  In FlickPlay, she explains, you don’t start with zero status, you have a reputation that is created by the things that you own within the ecosystem: “Ownership gets introduced as more than a profile picture, it gets introduced as a fundamental driver of how you shape your identity.”  To illustrate her point, she used what might be seen as an autobiographical comparison.  “If I walk into a restaurant in a city, and no one knows me, and I’m dressing the part, and I’m driving the right car,” she said, “I create my entrance into the space in a way that I already resemble status – no one needs to know how many followers or how big my community is.”  The recent partnership with The Sandbox was confirmation that FlickPlay is on the cutting edge, with the two firms pioneering the much longed for concept of interoperability – that is, allowing users to move between different platforms while using the same NFTs. Holders of The Sandbox NFTs will be able to use them on FlickPlay next quarter.  The feeling among those who are close to Merino is that the sky’s the limit for her – one of her investors calls her (only half-jokingly) “a rockstar.”  ""For someone to come here and build a startup, to convince people to build a whole verification around it, in an industry that was not even one she was in, this is the American dream, she is living that dream,” said Vu. “She’s living what most people really strive for.""  “She’s connecting the dots in terms of how can we can give this new technology … a different form of utility that others are not thinking about,” said Adame. “I think FlickPlay and Pierina are going to be at the top of a few different sectors.”  In fact, when you think about it, a chameleon is probably the most suitable animal that could represent FlickPlay, given the constant shape-shifting of its architect/jewelry manufacturer/metaverse-bending founder.  But what about more mundane concerns? Should parents be worried, for example, that Flicky the chameleon will get their kids hooked onto an app that is, after all, driven by ownership and status?  “Metaverse could be a very beautiful and impactful way for us to evolve the way we experience the real world, or it could be the destruction of humanity,” Merino said, admitting that the idea of kids putting on AR goggles and getting totally removed from the physical world for hours on end is disturbing.  But, she said: “If you give a kid an iPad and a toy, and research showed this, kids will go for the iPad. There is no way back, that’s the world we live in.  “How we build awareness about how a metaverse in the real world won’t change your reality but will shift the story line of your reality, I see that as a more sustainable way to educate kids on the value of the world we live in.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH | AR,Guy Hedgecoe,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/17/pierina-merino-rethinking-social-media-for-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb0744569399c6f26511af40ed710d7eb5b21c48-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42423303,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YHvh,1652799648,Former Wyoming Banking Commissioner Goes Web 3,"Albert Forkner, formerly state banking commissioner with the Wyoming Division of Banking, has joined Fortress Blockchain Technologies, a Web 3 infrastructure company that provides custody and management services for cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other types of digital assets.  Forkner has over 20 years experience as a banking regulator in Wyoming, and was heavily involved in the Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) bank charter, the first such framework for digital assets.  While NFTs and Web 3 are all on the menu at Fortress Blockchain Technologies, Forkner’s work on Wyoming’s SPDI over the last four years proved invaluable, according to Fortress CEO Scott Purcell, who previously oversaw digital asset innovation at Nevada-based Prime Trust.  As such, Forkner has gained a unique insight into crypto custody, not only at a state level, but also into where the U.S. as a whole is placed compared to other jurisdictions.  “Figuring out digital asset custody in Wyoming, we reached out to and spoke with the U.K.’s FCA [Financial Conduct Authority], and countries such as Finland, Switzerland, Abu Dhabi and Bermuda,” Forkner said in an interview. “The U.S. is much more complex because you’ve got a dual banking system and multiple regulators over markets.”  Leveraging his banking connections, Forkner – who will run the new Fortress Trust business – has been quietly working behind the scenes for the past five months to secure a trust license for Fortress with Nevada regulators, which was finally granted last week.  “I think that’s one thing I brought to the table, I have relationships with the banking commissioners or superintendents in the state system, having built that up over the last decade,” he said.  With almost 25 years as a banking regulator, it’s still an odd feeling to be on the other side of the desk, he added.  “I guess the thing about being a regulator is that you don’t actually build anything,” Forkner said. “This way I get to help build a new company.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/17/former-wyoming-banking-commissioner-goes-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f962b8100725a26101c5dec5c096d0a185210b46-3072x2149.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423309,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YI3h,1652798731,"ApeCoin Migration Draws Interest From Avalanche, Flow","After Yuga Labs’ disastrous non-fungible token (NFT) minting for its “Otherside” metaverse land sale cost investors more than $100 million in transaction fees, board members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club-linked ApeCoin DAO are listening to offers about migrating ApeCoin (APE) off Ethereum, CoinDesk has learned.  Two suitors are Avalanche and Flow, according to executives at the firms behind both networks. Both blockchains consider themselves to be better suited for hosting a large-scale NFT ecosystem like the one Yuga is building.  Yuga Labs first alluded to a potential ApeCoin migration at the end of an April 30 Twitter thread, “encouraging” the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) comprised of APE holders to consider it a possibility.  A source familiar with ApeCoin Foundation told CoinDesk the board had not previously considered migrating to a different layer 1, but that the tweet prompted discussion among the DAO’s members about a potential move, which remains ongoing.  While the DAO board is not “actively shopping” for new chains, according to the source, it recognizes its responsibility to implement the wishes of the DAO, including a chain migration if it were to be voted through in a proposal.  Members of the ApeCoin board include Reddit co-founder Alex Ohanian, Animoca Brands chairman Yat Siu and FTX’s head of gaming, Amy Wu.  The DAO has so far voted on 11 different proposals since its creation in March. Yuga Labs did not respond directly to CoinDesk’s request for comment on its influence over the decision-making process.  The case for AVAX and FLOW  In the case of an Avalanche move, Yuga’s ecosystem would be able to exist on its own subnet, which is a technology that allows the transactions of a single application to be isolated without clogging the broader network.  Avalanche committed $290 million to attracting subnets in March, though talks with the project remain preliminary.  “We’ve had some early discussions with [ApeCoin DAO] about subnets, and we’ve certainly got our pitch ready to go,” Kevin Sekniqi, co-founder and chief operating officer at Ava Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We all saw it with the land sale, NFT ecosystems of that size need to exist in a scalable environment.”  Flow’s blockchain offers a similar value proposition, having proven its capability of handling high-transaction volumes with NBA Top Shot, which sees tens of thousands of transactions each day.  Dapper Labs, the company behind Flow, also created the blockchain out of similar necessity following its famous CryptoKitties NFT debacle that temporarily choked Ethereum in a similar proportion to the Otherside sale.  “We’ve had some conversations with folks that are board members [of ApeCoin DAO], and I think it's going to come down to a vote,” Mik Naayem, chief business officer of Dapper Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview. “CryptoKitties faced similar challenges, and I think that Flow would be a great home for [ApeCoin], that being said there's still a lot of assets on Ethereum and things to consider.”  Pros and cons  The benefits of Yuga moving its ecosystem to its own chain are apparent – lower transaction costs, faster network speeds, the ability to pay gas fees in APE, etc. But potential problems that could stem from the move are just as obvious, like what the firm would do with all its existing Ethereum assets, which total over $1 billion in market cap.  Even with its own chain, plenty of complications could persist. The popular play-to-earn game Axie Infinity is seen by many as a cautionary tale of migration, most recently suffering from a $625 million exploit of its gaming-focused Ronin network. On the other hand, Crabada – based on its own Avalanche subnet – has emerged as a nascent Web 3 gaming hit.  As Dapper Labs’ Naayem said, the decision about migrating chains will ultimately be decided by members of ApeCoin DAO, an entity Yuga has affirmed it is not in control over, though undoubtedly influences.  UPDATE (May 17, 15:56 UTC): Sekniqi later clarified Ava Labs was in talks with ApeCoin DAO, not Yuga Labs, about a prospective subnet.",NEUTRAL,FLOW | APE,AXS | ETH | FLOW | APE | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/17/apecoin-migration-draws-interest-from-avalanche-flow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9c47bf3aaa8f4fc60beb44f1803b637db699143-5656x3590.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The comments suggest Dutch supervisors want to join the U.K. in banning access to options and futures based on virtual assets for regular retail customers, even if they don’t yet have the power to do so.  “I maintain that the trade in crypto derivatives should be restricted to wholesale trade,” said Paul-Willem van Gerwen, head of Capital Markets and Transparency Supervision at the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). He cited the risks of markets that are opaque, and prone to manipulation and other criminal activity.  The comments by van Gerwen were given in a speech last week and posted on the AFM website Tuesday.  Van Gerwen cited restrictions that already have been imposed by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority in 2020 that effectively limit trading to professional financiers, adding that, in the Netherlands, “we haven’t done so, yet.”  Amsterdam is a hub for many kinds of financial trading – all the more so since, post-Brexit, U.K. venues have been barred from European Union markets.  The AFM has already proposed restrictions on retail trading in more conventional financial instruments such as turbo leveraged products. The AFM doesn't have similar powers over crypto markets, but may acquire them once an EU law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) takes effect, an AFM spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Van Gerwen said he wanted to see more experiments using distributed ledger technology to support trades, which he said could cut costs. But he warned that there would always need to be centralized authorities in case a transaction gets bungled.

Other participants in the round included Tiger Global, Galaxy Digital, Electric Capital, ACapital, Framework Ventures, CoinFund, Lemniscap, Coinbase (COIN) and VMware (VMW), according to a draft blog post provided to CoinDesk.  Blockchain security breaches have hit the headlines this year with some creating nine-figure financial losses. They include $326 million for blockchain bridge Wormhole and $625 million for Ronin Network, the infrastructure behind popular play-to-earn game Axie Infinity.  Certora is designed to help developers detect and prevent security mistakes before code is deployed. The firm’s Prover tool is meant to complement human audits and bug bounties. Certora said it is currently securing $50 billion in decentralized finance (DeFi) assets. The product finds and displays any rule violations or formally proves that there aren’t any.  The company is led by Shmuel “Mooly” Sagiv, computer science chair at Tel Aviv University and a pioneer of formal verification, a field that uses complex mathematics to prove or disprove the correctness of an algorithm, such as the smart contracts on a liquidity protocol.  Certora currently handles only Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains. The next focus is extending support to Solana, then branching out further toward Polkadot.  “What we want to do in the next year is to cover all of the blockchains,” Sagiv told CoinDesk in an interview.  How it works  Certora identifies violations of invariants, or rules that shouldn’t be broken, in smart contracts. The firm’s technology has identified bugs in Aave, Compound, Balancer and SushiSwap. Most of the bugs were discovered and fixed before the code was deployed.  For example, Certora prevented a critical bug in SushiSwap’s Trident liquidity pool contract. In Trident, users add funds to create the pool then earn fees for their lending and swapping activities. The fees are proportional to their share of the overall liquidity.  For a liquidity pool to work, there has to be a technical rule that as long as there are pool funds, user shares must exist since someone is providing that liquidity. A violation of that rule means that either the shares of the pool are worthless or the funds exist but can’t be claimed by the users.  In the case of Trident, the Certora Prover found a rule violation that could have allowed an attacker to drain the pool’s funds. The problem was identified and corrected before the code was deployed.  “Powered by world-class experts, Certora leverages formal verification to employ a suite of scalable and robust products that offer much higher reusability and granular testing,” said Jump Crypto partner and investments head Saurabh Sharma in a statement.

42411119,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gizUdk,1652796000,"Ransomware Gang Extorted 725 BTC in One Attack, On-Chain Sleuths Find","The Takeaway  By combining chat logs leaked in February with subsequent analysis of blockchain data, researchers have gleaned new insights about the infamous Conti ransomware gang.  The gang used over-the-counter (OTC) brokers in Russia to cash out crypto extorted from victims and to pay members for their work, according to a CoinDesk review of the leaked chats.  At least one U.S. hospital attacked by the Conti ransomware during the coronavirus pandemic paid the ransom, the hackers’ inner communications show.  Ransom payouts to the gang may have been as high as 725 BTC and more, according to an analysis by Crystal Blockchain released Tuesday.  New wallets Conti used have been located, Crystal said.  In February, a hacker leaked a notorious ransomware gang’s chat logs, offering a rare peek inside the everyday operations of this criminal business and cryptocurrency’s vital role in it. But blockchain data helps paint a fuller picture.  The leaked messages showed the Conti hackers had more victims than previously reported. They also revealed that some of those organizations paid to get their IT systems back, and that the gang had ties to another infamous cybercriminal ring, known as Ryuk. Perhaps most importantly, the cache revealed Conti’s previously unknown bitcoin (BTC) wallet addresses.  That served as a jumping-off point for on-chain sleuths to fill in more pieces of the puzzle. For example, blockchain data shows at least one of the U.S. hospitals attacked during the pandemic might have paid ransom to the Conti hackers.  CoinDesk reviewed the Conti members’ leaked messages and analyzed the hackers’ crypto wallets and transactions with help from the on-chain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain. The exercise underscored an enduring paradox of crypto: While an ungated network with unblockable transactions is highly useful for criminals, the public ledger leaves a trail of crumbs for law enforcement and researchers to find later.  Hackers get hacked  Ransomware gangs are a menace born of the cyber age. While the devastation they spread in corporations is sometimes visible and tangible (remember the gas shortage provoked by the Colonial Pipeline attack last year?), their identities and the way they operate remain mostly concealed.  Now, the curtain has parted slightly as an indirect result of the war in Ukraine.  On Feb. 25, the Conti group declared its allegiance to the Russian government following the invasion of Ukraine. On its official website, Conti threatened to retaliate against the West in response to potential cyber attacks against Russia. This cyber saber-rattling appears to have provoked the leaks, which appeared in several places.  A Ukrainian security researcher who obtained access to the group’s IT infrastructure leaked the messages that accumulated on the gang’s internal Jabber/XMPP server from 2020 to 2021 to journalists and security researchers, according to CNN. Other media reports suggested the leak was made by a disgruntled Ukrainian member of the Conti gang. The archived messaged were published by a Twitter account dedicated to researching malware strains, known as @vxunderground.  “Conti ransomware group previously put out a message siding with the Russian government. Today a Conti member has begun leaking data with the message ‘F**k the Russian government, Glory to Ukraine!’"" tweeted @vxunderground.  Extortion cartels  The leaked communications of the Conti gang offers some visibility into how different ransomware strains can be related.  According to Conti’s messages, the group has been working with various ransomware strains and groups operating those strains: members mention working with Ryuk, Trikbot and Maze ransomware. According to the messages, Conti members not only ran their own ransomware business but also provided tools and services for other hacker groups.  For example, on June 23, 2020, the group’s leader, nicknamed Stern, tells a lower-level manager known as Target, in Russian: “Ryuk is going to get back from vacation soon. He will take all the bots that we have. For him, we need 5k companies.” (It’s not clear from the preceding and following messages which companies Stern meant.)  The messages also left a financial trace of this partnership: a bitcoin transaction between the Conti and Ryuk gangs, mentioned by Crystal Blockchain in a March blog post.  In September 2019, one of the bitcoin wallets associated with Conti sent 26.25 BTC (worth about $200,000 at the time) to a wallet associated with Ryuk, blockchain data shows.  “Payment information contained in the leaked chats strongly supports this connection and that Conti likely tried to contact Ryuk,” Crystal said in a blog post. “We also observed that Ryuk sent payments directly to a Conti wallet that was mentioned in the chat history several times; this suggests affiliation and some degree of operational coordination between these two groups.”  Read also: DarkSide Hackers' Bitcoin Stash Tracked  Earlier, cybersecurity researchers pointed at a possible connection between the operators of Ryuk and Conti ransomware because the malware contained similar pieces of code. However, financial connections between the Ryuk and Conti attackers hadn’t been revealed before.  Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez told Bleeping Computer the ransomware strain Conti uses has been changing hands many times over several years, starting as Hermes in 2017. Then it was supposedly purchased by other hackers and turned into Ryuk (possibly named after a Japanese manga character). Then, the group “splintered, re-branded or decided to transition to the ‘Conti’ name, which appears to be based off the code from Ryuk version 2,” Bleeping Computer wrote.  Conti operated during the coronavirus pandemic and attacked health care organizations worldwide, more than half of which were located in the U.S., according to the FBI. Cybersecurity experts have long suspected Conti’s connection to the Russian state, along with many other ransomware gangs.  Ryuk is known for hacking The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal’s publishing facilities in 2018, as well as several other companies. Both Ryuk and Conti used a variant of AES-256 encryption to encrypt victims’ files and extort ransom for decryption keys.  More victims  The leaked messages also shine light on the breadth of companies successfully attacked, many of which had not been previously reported.  Minnesota-based Ridgeview Medical Center was famously attacked in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, along with a range of other U.S. health care organizations, by the Ryuk and Trickbot malware strains. The Conti group was, apparently, behind those attacks, too: The members talk about successfully hacking into Ridgeview’s network and encrypting the data the medical center needed to operate.  According to Crystal, a transaction on Oct. 30, 2020, is most likely the 301 BTC payment (over $4 million at the time) Ridgeview sent to Conti as a ransom.  A day earlier, on Oct. 29, Conti members Target and Stern mentioned that Ridgeview was ready to pay $2 million, or 151 BTC; however, Conti’s supposed partner, the organizer of the attack, “wanted 300 BTC.”  Later, according to the chat logs, the hackers prevailed, and on Oct. 30, 301 BTC were sent from an address attributed to the Gemini crypto exchange to a wallet that appears to be indirectly related to another wallet, which Conti members mentioned in the chats as a payment address for extortion, according to Crystal.  Ridgeview did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.  It’s worth remembering that blockchain analysis to a certain extent is based on assumptions, and the attribution of a blockchain address to a certain real-life entity almost never is 100% precise. However, Crystal said it is quite confident in this one.  “The methodology we used was to look for related transactions that were at the same value of the ransom demand and discussed in the group,” said Crystal’s director of blockchain intelligence, Nick Smart. He added that Crystal had “90% confidence” the transaction was the ransom payment in question, given its timing, amount and connection to the earlier reported Conti wallets.  There were other, even larger payments the criminal group managed to gather.  The largest ransom an unidentified victim company paid to Conti, according to the chat logs, was 725 BTC, Crystal found. That chunk of bitcoin, equivalent to about $8 million at the time, was paid by the Chicago-based employment marketplace CareerBuilder, Crystal said, as the company was mentioned in the chats related to the 725 BTC payout.  The receiver of that payment could have been this bitcoin wallet, Crystal told CoinDesk. On Oct. 10, 2020, the address received 725 BTC and immediately sent it on, to another address not associated with any crypto service, on-chain data shows. There were no other transactions involving the address, except these two.  CareerBuilder did not respond CoinDesk's request for comment.  According to the leaked messages, there might have been around 30 previously unreported victims of Conti, including Xerox (XRX), the iconic photocopier maker, Crystal said. Xerox was known to have been hacked by a ransomware gang in 2020; however, cybersecurity experts linked the hack to the Maze gang.  It’s not clear from the chat logs whether Xerox paid the ransom. In 2020, customer support-related data from Xerox was leaked, suggesting the company refused to pay the ransom and saw its internal data leaked as a punishment, ZDNet reported. Xerox declined to comment for this story.  Some other attacks at the same time were definitely successful.  In particular, Conti members discuss attacks on Canadian pool manufacturer Softub and several U.S.-based companies: transportation company Piper Logistics, chain retailer Sam’s Furniture, outdoor equipment maker Clarus and cash handler Loomis.  Softub Director of Operations Tom Lalonde told CoinDesk in an email the company had its data saved in cloud-based backups so it didn’t pay the ransom.  However, the attack “did create a whole bunch of problems,” Lalonde said. The company “had a few ransomware attacks during that timeframe,” he added.  Piper Logistics, Sam’s Furniture, Clarus and Loomis did not respond to requests for comment.  In the messages, the Conti members mention attacking 89 companies, most of them based in the U.S., along with a bunch of Canadian, Australian and European corporations. It’s not clear how many of the attacks were successful and led to bitcoin payouts but the scale of operations definitely seems massive, Crystal said in a blog post published on Tuesday.  Conti members even mention plans to infect Pfizer (PFE), the major pharmaceuticals manufacturer and the co-creator of a COVID-19 vaccine, but it’s not clear whether an attack was conducted and, if so, whether it succeeded.  Crystal also said it located several previously unreported wallets the Conti group used, thanks to those wallets being mentioned in the chat logs: a wallet that received 200 BTC from an unidentified victim on Oct. 26, 2020; a wallet that collected payouts from various attacks; a wallet gang members used to manage operational expenses; and others.  Hacker’s budgeting  According to the leaked chat logs, Conti had some big plans related to crypto and blockchain. For example, the members have been entertaining the idea of creating their own peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace and a smart-contract-based tool for extortion.  The group also discussed disinformation campaigns to dump the prices for smaller cryptocurrencies and might have been involved in the Squid Game-themed exit scam, security researcher Brian Krebs wrote.  But the group’s interactions with crypto, for the most part, have been more mundane and illustrate how exactly crypto works and how it is converted into fiat money in the criminal underworld.  The leaked messages show the group’s everyday operations: Members discuss development of the malicious code, what works and what doesn’t, what payments are due for IT services the group uses and interaction with other criminal groups.  According to the messages reviewed by CoinDesk, Conti members used crypto, among other things, to pay for cloud servers and software licenses. For example, in one message, a member nicknamed Defender is asking Stern to send him $700 in bitcoin to pay for the server the group is using.  Although crypto serves as the main payment method between the group members, most preferred to receive their paychecks in fiat. For that, Conti members used an over-the-counter (OTC) broker, which is a popular method in Russia and Ukraine, where global centralized exchanges historically have been scarce.  In a message to a new member in July 2020, Stern explains how to receive a monthly paycheck: The new recruit should find an OTC desk with a favorable price on the Russian-language OTC aggregator Bestchange.com, create an order to sell bitcoin for a debit card transfer and provide Stern with a deposit address the OTC would generate.  This way, the “employee” would receive money in fiat directly to his debit card, while the boss would spend crypto, essentially using the OTC as a payment processor.  OTCs are also the main channel of the ransom cashouts, chat logs show. In one dialogue, a member named Revers explains how the extorted crypto is sold via OTC brokers: When transferring bitcoin, Conti sends money mules, or the so-called drops, to collect the cash, so that the actual owners of the ill-gotten bitcoin remain incognito.  “For $300K, nobody would go to Russia to look for you,” Revers adds.  Payment for IT products and server usage often requires fiat liquidity, too, and that’s where the crypto-native cyber criminals may face some obstacles paying their bills. In a chat between two members, Strix and Carter, Strix asks how Carter pays for servers via PayPal (PYPL), as OTC brokers only deal with the larger sums than the 7 euros per month Strix needed to pay for using his personal server.  Carter explains that first, he sells crypto on the peer-to-peer market LocalBitcoins for a bank transfer to his debit card, and the card is linked to a PayPal account. The card, he adds, is “phantom,” meaning, it doesn’t belong to him – supposedly, a money mule is used.  The PayPal account is verified, Carter says, raising the question if the PayPal account he’s using also belongs to a money mule, or has been verified using stolen or forged ID documents – a criminal service available and flourishing in the darknet, as a CoinDesk investigation earlier showed.

CyberConnect seeks to make personal data, such as social media platform handles and followers, work across Web 3 protocols. Blockchains tend to create data siloes.  The funding round was led by Animoca Brands and Sky9 Capital, and the company plans to put the funding towards building out the protocol, expanding the team and onboarding new Web 3 projects, CyberConnect CEO Wilson Wei told CoinDesk via email.  CyberConnect seeks to eliminate “moats around user data” and be more accessible to projects in the space.  “Ultimately, an open social graph lays the foundation for such identities and a truly interoperable and seamless social experience, which is the core feature of the metaverse,” said Wei.

42423315,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YIDh,1652792453,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Retakes $30K as 'Institutional Adoption' Makes Crypto More Like Stocks,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Brad Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off this week.)  Price point: Bitcoin retakes $30,000, but few analysts are ready to call a market bottom.  Market Moves: Everyone celebrated the arrival of institutional investors to the bitcoin market, as their rising adoption helped send prices soaring. Now, with correlations to traditional markets at an all-time high, fingers are pointing over the market swoon, Helene Braun reports.  Feature: Terra’s LUNA token gains and then slides, after blockchain founder Do Kwon proposes to create a separate chain or ""fork"" to make up for last week’s implosion of the UST stablecoin, Shaurya Malwa reports.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently back above $30,000 after losing the crucial foothold on Monday.  With crypto markets still looking wobbly after last week's crisis on the Terra blockchain, any signs of stabilization should be heartily welcomed by bitcoin bulls. Arcane Research, a Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm, wrote Monday that the market could get a jolt of fresh energy if bitcoin ends the week over $32,000.  For the time being, though, ""there is little reason to argue that a prolonged rise will follow the current buying, as the fundamentals (tightening markets, slowing economy) remain in place,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, wrote in emailed comments.  Ether (ETH) added 2.2% in the past 24 hours to trade above $2,000, with similar gains for Avalanche’s AVAX, BNB Chain’s BNB, and dogecoin.  Polygon’s MATIC (MATIC) gained 5.5% as Polygon Studios CEO Ryan Wyatt said the firm was working with Terra projects affected by last week’s implosion and would connect them to Polygon’s broader DeFi (decentralized finance) network. Terra held billions of dollars in value on various DeFi applications, such as Anchor, before last week’s fall.  In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures were higher ahead of Tuesday's exchange open in New York, along with gold. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 0.04 percentage point to 2.92%. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) was down 0.8%.  The uplift in global markets came as traders priced in expectations of relaxation of rules in Shanghai after weeks of strict lockdowns, leading to a bump in Chinese stocks. Policymakers in Beijing are taking steps to alleviate the economic slowdown, with various moves in the past week.  Traders could get fresh clues on U.S. central bankers' latest plans to tamp down fast-rising inflation from a 2 p.m. ET (18:00 UTC) appearance by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.  Market Moves  By Helene Braun  A key narrative in the crypto world in 2021 was the arrival of institutional investors to the market. Tesla (TSLA) bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS), as well as hedge funds, started to allocate clients' assets to bitcoin.  That was a sign of growing mainstream acceptance, and it appeared to drive up prices. Crypto boomed with the sector’s market capitalization growing 185% last year.  Now, as the crypto market's latest swoon wipes off $1.25 trillion from the industry's all-time high market capitalization reached late last year, the question is, what role is institutional money playing in the crash? Or to put it more bluntly, are institutional investors making things worse?  One thing we know: The crypto market is increasingly correlated to the stock market, and institutional investors appear to have heightened that correlation. And when the stock market goes down, it takes crypto with it.  “The influx of institutional interest in BTC, which started to pick up in early 2020 with public declarations of interest from stalwarts of traditional investing, such as Paul Tudor Jones and Renaissance Technologies, coincides with a sustained jump in the 60-day correlation between BTC and the S&P 500,” a report in April by Genesis Trading stated. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)

Terra’s LUNA Gains, Then Slides, After Do Kwon's Fork Proposal Traders sold the tokens even as founder Do Kwon proposed a separate chain to make up for last week’s implosion of UST.  Breaking Barriers to the Web 3 Creator Economy The latest innovations in blockchain technology are enabling creators to earn more from their work and achieve an unprecedented level of autonomy.  How Not to Run a Cryptocurrency Exchange At Japan's Liquid exchange, which was recently acquired by FTX, warnings were ignored, breaches unreported and employees berated and cursed at, insiders say.  Terra’s LUNA Gains, Then Slides, After Do Kwon's Fork Proposal  By Shaurya Malwa  Terra’s LUNA shed nearly a quarter of its value in the past 24 hours after a proposed revival plan revealed by Kwon, the founder, data shows.  LUNA rose to as much as $0.00022 on Monday evening as plans to fork the current Terra blockchain went viral on social media. It then shed as much as 22% in early Asian hours to trade at just over $0.00017 at writing time. Some $2.1 billion worth of the tokens were traded in the past 24 hours alone.  The token is down more than 99% since its high in April of nearly $120. The drop came as excess LUNA was put into circulation last week to prevent the collapse of terraUSD (UST), a Terra ecosystem stablecoin pegged to U.S. dollars, as reported.  Sentiment remains mixed for the proposal among the crypto community.  Some said they would support the new chain and anticipated the airdrop to prior holders. Others suggested the plan was unfair, as it could vastly benefit investors who purchased massive amounts of LUNA at a few pennies more than those who purchased the tokens when they were valued above $100. To combat this, however, Kwon proposed holding two snapshots – one prior to UST’s collapse and one after – and airdropping equivalent amounts of new tokens.

The Algorand partnership marks Wormhole’s 10th integration with a layer 1 blockchain, as developers focus on interoperability solutions. Popular layer 1, or base-layer, blockchains, such as Ethereum, Avalanche and Solana, cannot easily communicate with each other, meaning assets held on one blockchain are difficult to transfer onto and account for on another.  When tokens are bridged through Wormhole’s Portal Bridge, the original token is locked in a smart contract while a new Portal-wrapped version of that token gets minted on the target chain. Then, the wrapped tokens can be traded for tokens native to the target chain and used for decentralized finance (DeFi).  ""Wormhole has quickly become one of the largest DeFi networks in the world,"" Wormhole Foundation Director Hendrik Hofstadt said in a statement. “The network plays a key role in enabling liquidity to flow into new ecosystems, which has a profound impact on the growth and expansion of decentralizing protocols, projects, liquidity, governance and participation.”  However, bridges have been historically prone to hacks, with critics saying they do not offer nearly as much security as the standalone blockchains they connect.  Wormhole's Solana-Ethereum bridge was hacked for over $320 million in February, leading Wormhole backer and crypto market maker Jump Crypto to backstop the nine-figure exploit.  “The integration of Algorand to Wormhole’s network is great news for builders of this ecosystem,” said Michel Dahdah of Rand Labs, an Algorand developer who collaborated with Wormhole on the integration. “It will allow us to access all the liquidity that exists outside of Algorand, significantly boosting the TVL of the network.”  According to its website, Wormhole currently boasts integrations with blockchains Avalanche, Terra and Polygon, among others, and has racked up over $760 million in total value locked (TVL).

During this time, the RUNE price rose three times by 400%-500% and fell three times to the lower limit of consolidation. At the time of writing, the RUNE price is near the bottom line of consolidation. Of course, it is logical to assume that it is worth preparing for a new wave of growth of RUNE by 400%-500%, especially because the reversal of the RUNE cryptocurrency is always unpredictable and sharp. https://www.tradingview.com/x/e6ckwiE4/ However, we would like to emphasize some details that may land a little on the ground. From 17 May 2021, buyers can not update local highs, even with false breakdowns. According to local highs, you can draw a sloping trend line. But sellers manage to update local low. This speaks to the initiative of sellers, although not great at the moment. We forecast the first rebound of the RUNE price to $6.2. This mark is the local resistance of sellers and the middle of global consolidation. If the cryptocurrency market globally plans to fall further, it is from the $6.2 mark that a new fall wave may begin, which will destroy the consolidation structure.

42423304,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YHrh,1652791833,Ernst & Young Unveils Supply Chain Manager on Polygon Network,"Big Four accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young has unveiled its blockchain-based supply chain manager that is built for the Polygon network and that is aimed at solving bottlenecks in tracing products as they come to market.  The EY OpsChain Supply Chain Manager, which is now available in a beta version, is the first joint project between Ernst & Young and Ethereum scaling tool Polygon following the start of their collaboration last September.  The project is aimed at tackling chokepoints along supply chains combining product traceability with inventory management.  Organizations would create tokens to represent assets and inventory, which the OpsChain manager would then track across the supply chain network.  Scaling networks like Polygon are designed to lighten the load on base-layer blockchains such as Ethereum, processing transactions on a sidechain to reduce congestion and costs.  Polygon Nightfall, the network combining the fruits of the two entities' labor, offers zero-knowledge proof-based privacy technology, guaranteeing that only selected parties can see the full history of the assets tracked.  While supply chain management has often been cited as a compelling use case for blockchain technology, enterprises may have been put off adopting such tools because of a lack of privacy in transactions.  ""This is exactly the kind of commercial use case we envisioned when we set out to build and deploy the Polygon Nightfall network,"" Antoni Martin, enterprise lead for Polygon, said. ""Enterprise use cases outside of financial services are still not widely developed. Privacy tools open a whole new world for us.""

In the previous article, we wrote that we expect a test mark of $0.14. Of course, such a flurry of sales that occurred in the XLM market in a relatively short time was difficult to predict. In general, in a wave of panic, the XLM price was able to go even below $0.14. Thus, sellers managed not only to break an important range but also to update the local low from December 2020. All the stop orders of buyers who collected the position for six months actually worked out. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Yel23IOX/ What can you expect from XLM cryptocurrency next? First, it is worth noting that the weekly candle closed above the $0.14 range. A large pin has formed on the chart, which in a favorable market can signal a global market reversal. However, given the current sluggishness of the Bitcoin price movement, we still assume a modest 2 rebound of the XLM price to $0.2. This mark is the bottom trend line of sellers, which the price can not break from May 2021. If buyers manage to take control of this mark - in this case, we can predict the beginning of the reversal of the price and the transition of the initiative to buyers.

Traders priced in expectations of a relaxation of rules in Shanghai after weeks of strict lockdowns, leading to a jump in Chinese stocks. Policymakers in Beijing are taking steps to alleviate the economic slowdown with various moves in the past week.  Optimism around China helped create positive sentiment in the broader Asian market, as Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose as much as 6% and India’s Sensex jumped 2.5%. Indexes in Japan and Shanghai added nearly half a percentage point each.  Elsewhere, Europe’s Stoxx 600 was up 1.5% in midday trading, S&P500 futures gained 1.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.9%.  Lately correlated nearly 1:1 with broader equity markets , cryptocurrencies were ahead 3.2% after nearly a week of declines that saw bitcoin fall to as low as $24,000. At the time of this writing, the largest crypto was trading at $30,300. Ether (ETH) added 2.2% in the past 24 hours to trade above $2,000, with similar gains for Avalanche’s AVAX, BNB Chain’s BNB and dogecoin.  Polygon’s MATIC (MATIC) gained 5.5% as Polygon Studios CEO Ryan Wyatt said the firm was working with Terra projects affected by last week’s implosion and would connect them to Polygon’s broader DeFi (decentralized finance) network. Terra held billions of dollars in value on various DeFi applications, such as Anchor, before last week’s fall.  Inflation, bear market concerns  Crypto markets were weighed down in the past few weeks by waning sentiment for risky assets.

Over the next several months, Cloudflare plans to activate and fully stake Ethereum validator nodes on its global network. It was unclear how many nodes it would run or how much Ethereum it had purchased for staking. A stake of 32 ETH (about $66,500 at current rates) is required for each validator node on the Beacon Chain. Aside from staking ETH, the company is also conducting research into the next-generation consensus model.

42374725,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw272J,1652785200,A16z Addresses Downturn in Inaugural State of Crypto Report,"Noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has released its inaugural ""State of Crypto"" report that includes cyclical information relevant to the current downturn, according to draft materials provided to CoinDesk. Other key takeaways were related to Web 3 benefits and Ethereum’s continued blockchain dominance.  A16z has become one of the most prominent names in crypto investing. Last summer, a16z raised $2.2 billion for its third dedicated crypto fund, a record-setting vehicle until Paradigm’s $2.5 billion launch in November.  The “State of Crypto” report builds on a a16z blog post on the “price-innovation cycle” from May 2020, when digital assets were climbing out of the 2018 crypto winter. Later, bitcoin (BTC) reached a new record high in December 2020.  A16z said the crypto market is driven by a cycle where strong digital asset prices attract talent into the space, developers innovate during a downturn and the resulting projects and startups drive optimism once winter is over. The initial price-innovation cycle thesis in 2020 proved true, and a16z began working on the State of Crypto report.  “We thought it might make sense now that there’s all of these new and interesting focus areas in crypto that there’s data for, that there’s totally public information that you can go out and scrounge for yourself,” Eddy Lazzarin, head of protocol design and engineering for the a16z crypto team, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Web 3 early innings  Web 3, a broad term to define the next phase of the internet which means something different to everyone you ask, was a focus of the report. Crunching data for an area requires at least a general definition.  “I think at the high level for us, Web 3 is the term for the movement whereas crypto is the underlying tech that makes it possible,” Lazzarin explained.  A16z compared take rates, or the fee a marketplace charges on a transaction from a third party, between Web 2 and Web 3. Meta (FB) had nearly 100% take rates across Facebook and Instagram compared to the 2.5% take rate for non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea.  A16z conducted new data analysis to compare the payouts of Ethereum-based NFT creators with Web 2 creators. Last year, primary sales and royalty payments of Ethereum-based NFTs totaled $3.9 billion, four times the $1 billion that Meta reserved for creators through 2022, which represented about 1% of the tech giant’s revenue.  While Web 2 currently holds far larger user numbers, the upstart rival wins in terms of payouts. Overall, Web 3 paid out $174,000 per creator compared to the $0.10 per user for Meta, $636 per artist for Spotify and $2.47 per channel for YouTube.  On the blockchain front, a16z found that Ethereum remains the dominant force in Web 3, largely due to its early launch and large developer community. However, a16z thinks there can be multiple winners in the space.  Ethereum’s popularity has led to users paying more than $15 million in fees each day to use the blockchain. The well-known scalability issues, which create traffic jams and high fees, have created growing demand for layer 2 interoperability solutions like bridges and rollups, which connect to the Ethereum mainnet in ways that reduce transaction fees and traffic.  Using a number of on-chain metrics, a16z estimates a wide range of between 7 million and 50 million active Ethereum users. The firm estimates that Web 3 could potentially reach 1 billion users by 2031, meaning we are currently still in the early innings.  “Analogizing to the early commercial Internet, that puts us somewhere around the year 1995 in terms of its development timeline,” wrote a16z crypto members Lazzarin, Chris Dixon, Daren Matsuoka and Robert Hackett in a blog post.  “The internet reached 1 billion users by 2005 – incidentally, right around the time Web 2 started taking shape amid the founding of future giants such as Facebook and YouTube.”  CORRECTION (May 20, 19:23 UTC): Corrected earnings for YouTube to $405 per channel from $2.47 per channel.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/17/a16z-addresses-downturn-in-inaugural-state-of-crypto-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d035e012ed4f6bf72a7212ad1bf94e2d423d18d-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374711,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw26kh,1652784236,Citi Says Fallout From Terra Collapse Unlikely to Hit Wider Financial System,"Cryptocurrency markets have been under pressure in the past week following the collapse of the third-largest stablecoin, terraUSD (UST), Citi (C) said in a note published May 13.  The fall in crypto markets took place against the backdrop of already weak risk assets, and Citi says it does not expect a broader economic fallout because the digital-asset market is still relatively small compared with traditional asset classes and the makeup of household wealth.  The analysts said they saw no apparent “lead effect” from bitcoin (BTC) to S&P 500 index futures. The recent weakness in bitcoin and equities appears “contemporaneous,” according to the report. Still, given the existing poor sentiment in equities, the fall in crypto markets doesn’t help, it said.  Bitcoin is expected to remain highly volatile, and is influenced by many factors including potential regulatory action, the report added, noting that the BTC price has declined close to “production cost and spot adoption model implied valuations.""  The bank sees production costs as a floor because below these levels it is “less economical for mining, which may lead to a decline in hash rates, and an adjustment in algorithm difficulty to keep the bitcoin mining reward rate constant.”  Citi says regulatory interest in stablecoins is likely to increase after the UST depegging.  Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a report Thursday that clients were asking whether the large drop in crypto prices and the depegging of stablecoins poses a “more systematic risk for broader financial markets.”  Read more: Morgan Stanley Says NFTs Next to Watch After UST Collapse",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | MINING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/17/citi-says-fallout-from-terra-collapse-unlikely-to-hit-wider-financial-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c5c29df880147562e384a8739d3d305d67510a3-1500x986.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Choi added the move was to ensure the business was “best positioned to succeed during and after” the current market downturn. “Market downturns can feel scary … we plan for all market scenarios, and now we are starting to put some of those plans into practice,” Choi said.  The move is a departure from Coinbase’s plan to triple its headcount earlier this year, as reported. The exchange planned to hire up to 2,000 people to expand its product, engineering and design teams as recently as February.  Choi stated the crypto exchange remained in a strong position and had a “solid balance sheet” to make it through a market downturn.  The note comes days after a weak earnings report last week. Coinbase reported $1.17 billion in revenue for the first quarter this year, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.5 billion, according to FactSet.

42374726,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw273Z,1652779430,Bitcoin Mining Appears to Have Survived Ban in China,"China is once again contributing a significant chunk of the world's bitcoin (BTC) mining operations despite the ban last year, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF).  From September 2021 to January of this year, China's contribution to the bitcoin mining network was second only to that of the U.S., according to the CCAF's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), which maps the mining activity around the world based on the geolocational data reported by partnering pools.  Following the crackdown on bitcoin mining in the country last year, China's share was reduced to 0% in July and August. However, the CCAF's latest data show that the figure was up to 22.29% in September and fluctuated around 20% in October-January.  This suggests that underground mining activity has been underway in China. “Access to off-grid electricity and geographically scattered small-scale operations are among the major means used by underground miners to hide their operations from authorities and circumvent the ban,"" the CCAF said in a statement.  The sudden drop to 0% in July and August followed by a swift increase in the subsequent months suggests mining firms may have been operating covertly and concealing their locations while using foreign proxy services to fend off attention and scrutiny.

In that month, it reached an all-time high of $15 billion but then lost momentum and went down to $4.34 billion.

The company&apos;s official report regarding the hack noted that the hackers managed to get access to validator nodes, which resulted in the compromise of five validator nodes, a threshold also required to approve a transaction. Currently, the Ronin chain consists of nine validator nodes, and the hacker managed to get access to four of them and a third-party validator run by Axie DAO. This Axie DAO node was the root cause of the exploit last year. The DAO gave its access to Sky Mavis, the developers behind the game to sign off on transactions on its behalf. Because the access was never revoked, hackers leveraged it to their benefit by turning it into backdoor access, leading to a multi-million dollar hack. In the aftermath of the exploit, the Ronin bridge was closed, and all the deposits and withdrawals were halted for investigation purposes. In response to the hack, Axie Infinity co-founder and COO Aleksander Leonard Larsen said at the time that they would be adding several new validators to the Ronin Network to decentralize the network further.

42374727,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw274p,1652771083,"Terra’s LUNA Gains, Then Slides, After Do Kwon's Fork Proposal","Terra’s LUNA token shed nearly a quarter of its value in the past 24 hours after a proposed revival plan revealed by founder Do Kwon, data shows.  LUNA rose to as much as $0.00022 on Monday evening as plans to fork the current Terra blockchain went viral on social media. LUNA then shed as much as 22% in early Asian hours to trade at just over $0.00017 at writing time. Some $2.1 billion worth of the tokens were traded in the past 24 hours alone.  The token is down more than 99% since April highs of nearly $120. The drop came as excess LUNA was put into circulation last week to prevent the collapse of terraUSD (UST), a Terra ecosystem stablecoin pegged to U.S. dollars, as reported.  Last night, Kwon proposed forking Terra to a new chain that would entirely cut out its failed UST product and instead focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications building on Terra.  The current chain would continue as Terra “Classic,” while holders of LUNA on the “Classic” chain would receive token airdrop on the new chain’s token under the plan. Although still a proposal, if a majority of network validators and the community were to approve the plan, the new network could be launched as soon as May 27, Kwon said.  Sentiment remains mixed for the proposal among the crypto community.  Some said they would support the new chain and anticipated the airdrop to prior holders. Others suggested the plan was unfair because it could vastly benefit investors who purchased massive amounts of LUNA at a few pennies more than those who purchased the tokens when they were valued above $100. To combat this, however, Kwon proposed holding two snapshots – one prior to UST’s collapse, and one after – and airdropping equivalent amounts of new tokens.  Plans to compensate relatively ""small"" holders of UST and LUNA affected in last week’s collapse were also underway, Kwon claimed.  Despite LUNA's and UST's crash last week, some market observers remain upbeat on the longer-term outlook of algorithmic stablecoins, which are typically backed by other cryptocurrencies and rely on traders who buy and sell the underlying tokens to continually maintain their peg.  ""It is still the earliest days of algorithmic stablecoins,"" Brian Gallagher, co-founder of Partisia Blockchain, said in a Telegram message this weekend. ""There will be many failures along the way to hold the peg, as they're mostly in the experimental phase. We have to accept the failures along the path.”  However, critics likened protocols designed like UST to those of a Ponzi scheme. ""It sounds just like a crypto version of a pyramid scheme,"" billionaire and Pershing Square Capital founder Bill Ackman said in a tweet on Tuesday. ""Investors were promised 20% returns backed by a token whose value is driven only by demand from new investors in the token. There is no fundamental underlying business.""

From exclusive, invite-only Discord servers for NFT collections to airdrop and insider news communities, countless blockchain, NFT, crypto, DeFi, and Web3 projects use Discord as their go-to community engagement and marketing platform. Unfortunately, many server security issues, hacks, compromised accounts, and other privacy problems on Discord have plagued the platform.

42411452,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4T3,1652751828,Breaking Barriers to the Web 3 Creator Economy,"With blockchain technology, sports stars, celebrities and creators have found unprecedented, more powerful ways to monetize their work, create stronger bonds with the communities that admire them and become completely autonomous.  However, in ""New Money With Spencer and Solo,"" Spencer Dinwiddie and I quickly learned that existing Web 2 structures no longer easily support creators in their career goals. Our guests described feeling a significant imbalance in the amount of content they created and its respective value, versus the amount they were earning. They spent significant time and money delivering material that satisfies both audiences and algorithms.  Solo Ceesay is chief operating officer and co-founder at Calaxy.  As the fickle features of Web 2 algorithms have not been publicly accessible, creators have had to gamble for a prominent spot at the top of social feeds. Understanding how to maximize monetary value from content creation has therefore been impossible, meaning creators’ revenue streams have been unreliable. How does someone run a successful business under these conditions?  For all its good, Web 2 has empowered the small groups that create social media algorithms and advertising functionality to monopolize these protocols and determine which creators make money, by what means and by how much.  In turn, how these brands interact with a platform magnifies this tyrannical power dynamic. Social media companies rely on brands for advertising revenue. Meanwhile, brands rely on social platforms for exposure, capitalizing on the following of social influencers. Digital creators become pawns that social platforms and brands exchange. It’s a win-win situation for the major corporations involved, but the value received by creators falls short.  Read More: After DeFi, DeSoc: Finding Web 3’s Soul  Web 3’s open access eliminates the power hierarchy, enabling creators to take control of their businesses. Spencer noted that “our 'New Money' conversations taught us about the pressing urgency for creators to be able to monetize directly, without the interference of a third-party,” and that newly developed, decentralized platforms provide more efficient avenues for transactions between creators and fans.  Career stability  Content creation on Web 3 looks very different with creators able to determine how much they charge and under what conditions. This model turns social media into a stable career choice, eliminating the unpredictability that inflames anxiety and discourages participation. Creators have greater equity than in existing payment models, and fans may treat paywalls with scorn.  But most fans and creators have yet to understand how Web 3 enables easier access to content and creates more sustainable business models than other approaches. Now, developers have a golden opportunity to address this gap quickly and permanently shift power from giant corporations.  Correcting wrongs  Web 3 enables us to correct some of the most egregious wrongs of current social platforms. Unfortunately, we have witnessed numerous incidents in which Web 2 algorithms discriminate against marginalized communities.  Indigenous American activists found their Instagram posts were being censored and Black creators have sued YouTube for automatically removing their content under alleged racial prejudice. TikTok critics have targeted its ""filter bubble""-style algorithm, which allegedly pushes videos from the same demographic of people and has prompted many Black creators to abandon the app.  The direct engagement central to Web 3 platforms is allowing creators and fans to bypass the possibility of algorithmic discrimination and ensure that minorities have equal opportunities to define their careers.  Lessons learned  ""New Money"" taught us that creators still have fundamental questions about accessing and using Web 3. They are used to the closed-source, centralized monopoly of our current web infrastructure.  For example, creators need practical guidance on how to download a crypto wallet and use it to buy and store digital assets. Even some of the largest tech giants and international brands have yet to fully embrace these tools, therefore such information is hard to attain.  Read More: Terra, Web 3 and Acceptable Risk in Innovation  There’s no step-by-step guidebook for social media influencers. Our ""New Money"" guests the Victor Twins felt they were underpaid, and bemoaned the lack of resources from which they could learn to correct this issue.  Many of our guests didn’t know the variety of ways that Web 3 could further their careers, even in the use of something as increasingly important as non-fungible tokens (NFT). Influencers, artists and others are dropping NFT collections seemingly daily. A number of pro athletes and politicians have converted their salaries into crypto.  How can people incorporate such technologies into their businesses? How can they adopt something without the correct tools or the knowledge to use them?  The most important lesson we learned across 12 episodes is that Web 3 projects must launch comprehensive, educational initiatives that reach diverse communities everywhere. “There is a need for education on current modes of monetization and the advantages of content creation in Web 3,” Spencer said.  Spencer and I see ""New Money"" as a starting point. We will continue to learn eagerly from future conversations and seek ways to incorporate true Web 3, decentralized philosophy into our work. We are cognizant of the ongoing gaps in knowledge that could change business in creative fields and perhaps every other aspect of daily life.  Our show also offered a rare opportunity to observe the wider crypto landscape. What we found was encouraging, a world with enormous potential if developers and others involved in its innovation take the right steps forward- steps that will ultimately lead to a digital economy with more just revenue streams and a world of new money.

42411124,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gizUqy,1652749485,How Not to Run a Cryptocurrency Exchange,"The Takeaway:  From the outside, Japanese exchange Liquid looks like a crypto success story. Trading powerhouse FTX recently acquired it for an undisclosed price estimated to be somewhere between $140 million and $200 million.  But former Liquid employees describe a chaotic workplace (even by crypto standards) with questionable security and compliance.  For example, sources say that executives downplayed some information security breaches, did not disclose others, failed to adequately address low-level insider theft and prematurely stopped investigations into last year’s $90 million hack.  Liquid bought its own QASH token to maintain the price through part of the 2018 bear market and double-counted trades when reporting its volumes, former employees said.  Senior management offered IOUs for Telegram’s never-issued GRAM tokens and, according to sources, ignored internal compliance team concerns. Liquid lost millions on the offering.  The December 2018 company Christmas party was awkward, to say the least, for employees of the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange known as Liquid.  Mike Kayamori, co-founder and CEO, wore a Santa Claus suit to the party, held at Liquid’s office, about five minutes from Tokyo Station. About 50 employees were at the party, some of them with their children. A Black employee dressed up as a reindeer.  Kayamori asked the employee, whose wife was in attendance, to get on his hands and knees. The CEO then mounted him like a horse.  People stood with their drinks and watched. Holiday music played in the background.  “He obviously didn’t look happy. He was trying to do his best,” an eyewitness said of the employee.  Shortly afterward, Kayamori apologized to colleagues.  “I wanted a reindeer to cheer up the crowd with me,” he wrote in a message posted on the company’s Slack on Dec. 20, 2018, reviewed by CoinDesk. “I had not even realized what a terrible thing I [had] done until this was brought up to me later.” Kayamori added that he had apologized directly to the employee (who soon left the company).  “I preach diversity and unity,” Kayamori continued. “I will always remember today as the humbling day I let everyone down and that I need to grow as a human being.”  The incident speaks to management problems that long bubbled under the surface at Liquid.  “Of all the things Mike did, I don’t think that was the worst thing,” the eyewitness said. “This was minor.”  A chaotic workplace  From the outside, Liquid looks like a crypto success story, albeit with some bumps along the road. It was one of the first exchanges to be licensed in Japan, which boasts some of the world’s toughest regulations for crypto.  Like many exchanges, Liquid weathered hacks, including a $90 million theft last August that forced it to get an emergency loan from crypto derivatives exchange powerhouse FTX. Led by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX later agreed to buy Liquid, legally known as Quoine (pronounced “coin”), for an undisclosed price in a deal that closed on April 4 of this year.  Over the past five weeks, CoinDesk interviewed more than a dozen former Liquid employees and other individuals familiar with the exchange’s inner workings. Nearly all of them asked for anonymity for fear of reprisal.  Taken together, the interviews and internal documents reviewed by CoinDesk paint a picture of a chaotic workplace, even by the standards of a global crypto industry known for its hard-charging personalities and loosey-goosey corporate cultures.  Kayamori's management decisions and casual attitude toward information security may have led to security breaches, more than one of which were not adequately disclosed to customers, four former employees said. Employees were berated and cursed at, and their concerns about regulatory, cybersecurity and business risks were ignored.  While some employees tried to do right by users, management was known to dismiss their efforts.  “There are forces of order and good trying to make things happen, but the existing culture has an immune system seeking out and destroying them,” a former employee said.  CoinDesk emailed Kayamori for comment on whether Liquid complied with regulatory expectations, and whether he had anything to say to former employees who expressed their unhappiness with the company’s work culture and his leadership. He did not respond.  Auspicious beginnings  In 2017, Japan was one of the most active places in the world for crypto. It was one of the first countries to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges, requiring them to register with the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA). Japan also introduced a legal definition of “virtual currency” in its Payment Services Act.  “There was huge retail interest, progressive regulators and huge potential for the country to become a real leader in the space,” said Steve Lee, an investment director and head of the Asia-Pacific region at BlockTower Capital.  Liquid was in the pole position. Founded as Quoine in 2014, the exchange pitched itself as a company that did things by the book. It was among the first batch of companies to receive a license and ran one of the country’s largest exchanges. Besides Japan, it had a presence in Singapore and teams based in the Philippines and Vietnam.  The company initially operated two exchanges: Quoinex, which facilitated trading between fiat currency and bitcoin (BTC), and Qryptos, which handled only crypto-to-crypto trades. It later merged the two, rebranding under the name Liquid.  Kayamori had a prestigious resume, having studied at Harvard Business School and the University of Tokyo and worked at SoftBank, the Japanese investment conglomerate. Co-founder Mario Gomez Lozada had worked at financial giants Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse (CS). Kayamori dealt with the business while Lozada handled the technology and development of financial products.  An early employee remembers working out of a small office consisting of one large room that could fit 10 people comfortably and three meeting rooms, one of which became an extension of the office due to the lack of space.  “Mike was a reasonable leader when times were good,” another former employee said.  Kayamori's grand vision  Kayamori talked a lot about high-level concepts such as “financial inclusion” and “democratizing finance,” the same former employee said. “He had a vague vision, but it was largely detached from reality.”  Then, as now, crypto was an illiquid market compared with traditional stocks or bonds, meaning a large order to buy or sell a coin could be hard to fill and could mightily sway market prices. Kayamori claimed Liquid could solve this problem through a pooling system he called the “World Book.”  There are hundreds of crypto exchanges around the world, each with its own order book, or list of offers to buy or sell a given coin at a specific price. Kayamori wanted to aggregate orders from global exchanges into one order book. An offer to sell a token on the U.S. exchange Coinbase (COIN), for example, could be matched with a buy offer on Liquid if both listed the asset.  Investors believed in the vision. The company raised roughly $105 million worth of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) by distributing its native QASH token in an initial coin offering (ICO) in November 2017.  At its peak, Liquid’s community of followers, across the main group in the Telegram messaging app, the subreddit forum on Reddit and social channels ran into the tens of thousands. Many of these were QASH holders.  As an exchange token, QASH could be used to pay trading fees on the issuer’s platform. In a video from the time, Lozada said that other crypto exchanges were willing to adopt QASH and that banks and financial institutions would benefit from doing so. But only a handful of other crypto exchanges listed it.  QASH was created as an ERC-20 standard token running on the Ethereum network, but the project’s white paper (something between a prospectus and a manifesto) called for the creation of a brand-new blockchain by the second quarter of 2019. Migrating to its own blockchain would boost QASH’s value, Lozada said in the video.  Even in Liquid’s glory days, things weren’t quite as they seemed. Kayamori claimed publicly in March 2018 that the company was connected with more than 17 other exchanges. However, in internal Slack messages reviewed by CoinDesk, an employee wrote that “none of the 17 exchanges ever agreed to be part of the external” World Book and that Liquid could access Coinbase’s liquidity only by paying the U.S. company a fee. “We have no official agreement from them,” this employee said.  That year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went after many token issuers for selling unregistered securities to American buyers, but Liquid appears to have not been on its radar. Internal records reviewed by CoinDesk show that 217 individuals from the U.S. bought QASH tokens in the ICO. Those U.S. citizens who took part in the sale bought 10,294,721 tokens at a price of 24 cents each, for a total of $2 million.  Flush with cash  The ICO’s success meant that Liquid had a native token and a road map. The token didn’t tank right after its debut, as many others did. The company had cash to spend.  “It meant that Mike was promising all these things,” said a former employee, who called the ICO “a blessing and a curse.” QASH reached an all-time high of $2.45 on Jan. 14, 2018.  That same month, hackers made off with $520 million in funds from Japanese exchange Coincheck. The hack had reverberations for every exchange in Japan.  “It scared off institutional investors as well as retail investors, slowed down crypto development and brought tougher regulation,” Lee said. “The crypto market in Japan is still struggling to recover from that hack.”  Liquid found itself operating in one of the world’s most tightly regulated jurisdictions for crypto. The JFSA launched a round of inspections and stiffened the rules.  To secure user funds, the regulator stipulated that most customers’ assets be held in cold wallets – with the private keys, or passwords, stored in a hardware device disconnected from the internet or written on a piece of paper locked in a safe.  The last major crypto bear market began in early 2018. Liquid’s financial health was “dented by the crypto market but solvent to the point where they could run for another year and a half at that burn rate,” a former employee said. The company had “at least tens of millions of dollars,” this person said.  The exchange was growing, with staff numbers across offices ballooning from around 50 in 2017 to over 300 in 2018. Senior management decided it was time to move to an office that reflected the company’s future.  In June 2018, Japan employees moved to Kyobashi Edogrand, a glass-and-steel building in one of Tokyo’s most expensive districts. The company occupied a space of over 6,500 square feet, paying around $200,000 per month in rent, two former employees said. The rate was double the city’s average.  During this period, Liquid followed best security practices, two former employees recalled. The office featured a heavily secured “signing room” for crypto transfers. Fingerprints were needed to enter the air-gapped room (where the network was isolated from unsecured ones) and cameras watched from inside and outside. Large withdrawals required sign-off from one employee in Japan and another in the Vietnam office, and these were processed every few hours.  Executive in-fighting  On June 22, 2018, Japanese regulators handed out business improvement orders to the Liquid exchange and five other crypto companies, requiring them to improve their risk management practices. Liquid’s improvement order hindered efforts to do new business in Japan, where half of its client base resided.  Kayamori didn’t address the compliance issues, and instead blamed employees for not generating more revenue in Japan, four former employees said.  The co-founders started feuding. Liquid informally split into two teams as each founder tried to push the other out, six former employees said.  “Their flaws almost balanced each other out in the beginning,” a source close to Liquid said. “It got to the point where they couldn’t even be in the same room.”  “Mario had grown frustrated by the slow pace of development and the repeated failures,” one former employee explained. Lozada believed that Kayamori had put the wrong people in key positions, another said.  Lozada wanted to create Qryptos, a crypto-to-crypto exchange, to supplement the exchange’s primary offering of facilitating trades between crypto and fiat currencies, the former employee explained. Kayamori decided to put a young and inexperienced staff member in charge of the project, who took a week-long vacation two weeks before the launch.  It was the “right time, wrong person,” the former employee said, noting that Binance launched around the same time and became a wildly successful crypto-to-crypto exchange.  Read more: The Unbelievable Brilliance of Binance (2019)  While Lozada understood technical matters better than Kayamori, he was not particularly strong at execution, another former employee said. Lozada often yelled at junior staff and ridiculed people for making mistakes, he said.  Kayamori did the same, former employees said. “He was good and humble when he talked to me,” said one source, but he also shouted at employees in team calls, rhetorically asking why everyone was stupid and didn’t do their job well.  People broke into open infighting in public Slack channels. “They would just go nuts on Slack,” a source close to Liquid recalled. Abusive language was pervasive. Team leads referred to employees as “f**king idiots,” “childish,” and to their work as “garbage.”  ‘Bizarre favoritism’  Liquid was highly unmeritocratic, two former employees said. There were standards but it didn’t seem to matter if you met them. Managers awarded discretionary bonuses to those close to them.  Kayamori showed “bizarre favoritism,” another former employee said, citing as an example the appointment of fellow SoftBank alumnus Katsuya Konno to Chief Financial Officer.  This person recounted an incident in spring 2018 when Konno was working on the launch of the Japan-focused Liquid mobile app. According to this former employee, Konno spent freely on banner ads, yet there was scant monitoring of ad performance or ad targeting.  At one point, Liquid was notified that its Google advertising accounts were at risk of being shut down for failure to pay about $300,000 in bills. A wire transfer from a bank would take too long to save the account. So a marketing department employee spent most of her day at a convenience store, making one small payment after another until the total amount owed was sent to Google.  Given that the convenience store transfer limit is usually around 250,000 yen (about $2,000), the marketing employee likely spent five hours making 150 transfers, this person estimated.  That same year, Liquid sold a large proportion of ether raised in the ICO at what turned out to be the bottom of the market, two former employees said.  “They held onto it, hedged none of it,” one said, “then panic sold.”  Konno did not respond to a request for comment.  ‘Hail Mary projects’  The feud between the co-founders not only divided the company, but it meant that staff worked on a huge range of initiatives and products.  “When Mike and Mario were feuding over the company, there were various, crazy ‘hail Mary’ projects that they attempted,” a former employee said.  Among Lozada’s pet projects was a 100x leveraged contract-for-difference (CFD) derivative product called Liquid Infinity, introduced in April 2019 for non-Japanese customers. Such highly leveraged contracts are generally a risky investment, and Liquid’s own limitations made it moreso.  “The exchange’s thin liquidity meant that any medium-large buy or sell could spike or crash the market,” one former employee explained. As a result of those dramatic swings, traders’ highly leveraged positions were more likely to be liquidated, two former employees said.  Also in April 2019, Liquid announced a U.S. venture called Liquid USA. A person with knowledge of the venture said that Liquid management insisted Liquid USA allow “basic” accounts, which did not require know-your-customer (KYC) screening, even though such accounts generated little revenue and were likely to be frowned upon by U.S. regulators.  Read more: What Is KYC and Why Does It Matter For Crypto?  The venture relied on Liquid’s technology, which this person described as a “huge albatross.” The flagship Japanese exchange sometimes crashed, the person said, and management seemed to prioritize fancy layers of tech over getting the fundamentals right. In late 2020, the U.S. venture was called off.  Throughout its history, Liquid hemorrhaged talented people responsible for core products, five former employees said.  “The good people left and you have people in roles that probably feel a bit too large for them,” said Norbert Gehrke, founder of Tokyo FinTech, a non-profit organization of Japan fintech enthusiasts. Gehrke invited Kayamori to speak to Tokyo FinTech members in 2017 and is familiar with other Liquid staff.  Double-counting trades  Liquid kept up appearances. QASH held its value in November and early December 2018 even as bitcoin and ether, the crypto market’s bellwethers, tumbled.  It did so thanks, at least in part, to the company buying its own token to sustain the price at 21 cents, Slack messages reviewed by CoinDesk show. It does not appear that Liquid disclosed these purchases publicly.  In other messages, employees discussed the company’s practice of double-counting trades. While the industry norm is to count a trade only once, Liquid’s system recorded each trade twice, once for the buy order and again for the sell order. So, for instance, a trade of 1 BTC was recorded as 2 BTC. This reporting practice inflated the exchange’s trade volume, making it look more successful than it was.  Liquid continued to brand itself “the world’s most secure exchange” through 2019, although four former employees said that by this time security had deteriorated.  Two of those employees described an incident in which a customer service employee took advantage of a loophole on the back end to create bogus accounts, using administrator privileges to withdraw small amounts of BTC and XRP from company wallets. The employee made off with around $30,000 worth of crypto.  Liquid’s now-porous security frustrated some of its employees. One of them ran a “pentest,” or penetration test, which attained exchange funds on a thumb drive, and delivered the drive to senior management to demonstrate how easy it was to breach security, two former employees said. Pentests are a form of white-hat, or benevolent, hacking, akin to testing your front door after locking it.  During this period, Kayamori’s priority was dressing up Liquid for sale. In April 2019, announcing a Series C funding round of undisclosed size, he declared Liquid a unicorn, one of only two billion-dollar companies on Japan's startup scene.  “The raise was structured solely to get that billion number out there,” a source close to Liquid said. The round was done in two parts; Liquid raised a larger amount of money at a lower valuation, and then a small amount of money at the unicorn valuation, the source said, calling this decision “a sign of the hubris of Mike Kayamori.”  IEO for an IOU  Kayamori and Konno spent roughly $5 million worth of Liquid’s ICO funds buying allocations of GRAM tokens, which were meant to be the native tokens for messaging app provider Telegram’s ambitious blockchain project, the TON network.  “Please work on this as if our survival depends on the success of the Gram IEO because it really does,” Kayamori told employees on Slack. (IEO stands for initial exchange offering, a token sale managed by an exchange, which was a fashionable way to distribute new crypto assets at the time.)  Read more: Initial Exchange Offerings Are Providing Big Returns, But Why? (2019)  Traders in private markets were buying and selling IOUs for GRAM even though Telegram’s token agreement prohibited buyers from selling their allocations until the network went live.  Liquid purchased the allocations not from Telegram itself but from an entity known as Gram Asia, two former employees said. Gram Asia, in turn, had bought allocations from another party, and so on.  Read more: Early Investors in Telegram Crypto See 400% Returns – But Buyers Risk It All (2019)  Compliance staff raised questions about delivery risk, operational risk and reputation risk, according to an internal document. On balance, senior management wanted to generate quick revenue.  In October 2019, the SEC sued Telegram, citing violation of U.S. securities law, and the tokens never got minted. Liquid didn’t sell anywhere close to the amount of GRAM tokens it bought, nor did it recoup the funds sent to Gram Asia, three former employees said.  Liquid canceled the GRAM sale in January 2020 and refunded the money to investors. The exchange lost money on the IEO, at least $5 million, three former employees said.  Downgrading offices  In 2020, Liquid cut costs by moving its Tokyo headquarters into a fourth-floor office, which is usually the cheapest, due to the number four’s inauspicious similarity to the Japanese word for death.  The new office, where the company remains, was less than a quarter of the size of the previous office. Unlike the previous headquarters, the new digs had no beds, no cafe and no private rooms; employees worked in an open-plan office.  The signing room was now a thing of the past. By this time, Liquid had started using the services of a cryptographic key management company called Unbound, which relies on a method called multi-party computation (MPC), or “warm wallet” technology.  Crypto exchanges balance business interests against security risks. Users want fast withdrawals, and also expect their funds to be secure. Cold, or offline, wallets are safe from hackers but slow down withdrawals. Hot wallets, connected to the internet, are riskier yet make withdrawals easy. In 2019, MPC technology was a popular middle option, a former Liquid employee recalled.  Read more: MPC Explained: The Bold New Vision for Securing Crypto Money (2019)  Spending by the C-suite continued despite the office downgrade.  “They were just blowing through all the money in the ICO on stupid things,” a former employee said, citing executives taking first-class flights between Vietnam and Japan.  There was pressure to make Liquid quickly profitable, which may have driven Kayamori to leap from shiny thing to shiny thing, four former employees said.  Listing fees  Liquid took five- and six-figure token listing fees as high as $250,000 from projects, an internal document reviewed by CoinDesk shows. Their tokens were usually listed on the global part of the exchange, unavailable to Japanese customers. (The document shows one pending deal with a U.S.-based project that would pay an extra $100,000 for a “Japan listing” on top of its $150,000 fee.)  Liquid came close to listing the SHOPIN token before the SEC charged the project’s CEO, Eran Eyal, with fraud. The company also onboarded the ARE token, only to delist it less than a year later.  Yet, at the same time, Liquid declined to list projects that management acknowledged were of high quality if they refused to pay listing fees, according to Slack messages reviewed by CoinDesk. (The absence of listing fees would not necessarily make listing a token unprofitable for the exchange, if it could make money over time on trading fees.)  When asked by CoinDesk whether he refused to list high-quality tokens favoring more dubious tokens instead, Seth Melamed, who headed business development at Liquid up to November 2019, before becoming chief operating officer, described listing digital assets as a “multi-faceted process.” Considerations included due diligence, timing and costs of technology implementation, among other factors, he said.  Liquid also allowed U.S. citizens to take part in dozens of ICOs and IEOs, even though these were not registered as securities and thus risked putting the company in the SEC’s crosshairs, said a former employee.  “There's still the question of whether the offer and sale of the tokens in question qualify as securities transactions, but it's definitely going to put the exchange on the SEC's radar if it wasn't there already,” said Grant Gulovsen, an attorney in private practice who represents clients involved in crypto.  All the while, building the company’s own QASH blockchain continued at a snail’s pace.  “It didn’t get enough attention or manpower,” a former employee said, recalling that six to seven developers spent a week each month building the QASH blockchain.  To become a successful layer 1, or base, blockchain, this person said, QASH needed at least double the number of developers as well as to put together a marketing campaign and a plan to persuade people to use the chain.  According to internal Slack messages from the second half of 2019, management realized Liquid was not going to deliver on ICO investor expectations, such as the proprietary blockchain for QASH and the World Book.  Leak-driven marketing  Also during this period, Liquid took steps to capitalize on another company’s mistake.  In November 2019, Bitmex, a high-flying crypto derivatives exchange known for its leveraged futures contracts, disclosed that it had accidentally revealed tens of thousands of customer email addresses in the “cc” field of a mass mailing.  Read more: BitMEX Says Quality Check 'Failure' Led to Email Privacy Breach  Liquid got a hold of these addresses and cross-referenced them with those of its own users, according to a former employee and Slack messages reviewed by CoinDesk.  A Liquid marketing manager wrote a plan to court existing customers who had accounts at Bitmex, the former employee said, because these traders were likely to be users of leverage. Liquid aimed to become their preferred place for leveraged trading.  Targeting Bitmex customers who didn’t already have Liquid accounts would have been too risky, the former employee explained.  It is unclear whether Liquid ever followed through on the plan.  Personal laptops for work  In early 2020 employees began working remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Kayamori was known not to turn on his camera for online meetings; employees only heard his voice. He appeared to some to leave day-to-day management to Chief Operating Officer Melamed.  From April to June 2020, some employees had to use their personal laptops for work.  “It was a red flag because this is a financial company” that should have provided staff with secure devices, a former employee said. Liquid eventually solved the problem by reallocating laptops from departing employees to those who remained, this person said.  “Instead of taking calculated risks, executives cut the company to pieces at the expense of individual employees,” another former employee said. The company didn’t spend money to capitalize on bull runs or the so-called DeFi summer of 2020, when decentralized finance protocols rewarded users with generous yields for lending their tokens, this person said.  Kayamori persuaded the board to vote Lozada out in the middle of 2020.  When asked about his departure by CoinDesk, Lozada said that it was “amicable.” He did not respond to questions about his performance as co-founder, nor the products and practices he introduced.  Security holes  A higher-than-usual proportion of customer service employees had access to the user accounts at a level that meant they could change user details, view wallet addresses and view funds, a former employee said.  On Nov. 13, 2020, Liquid was hacked. The exchange blamed security lapses at domain registrar and web hosting company GoDaddy (GDDY).  The vendor “incorrectly transferred control of the account and domain to a malicious actor,” Kayamori wrote at the time. GoDaddy did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  Kayamori claimed that client funds were accounted for, and remained safe and secure. But two former employees said the full extent of the November 2020 hack was never disclosed. Customer assets and a trove of personal data were stolen, they said.  “Insofar as Mike ever considered security at all, he thought of it as a product that he could buy,” a former employee said sardonically. “Yep, we bought ourselves a security. Got one, don't need to waste any more cash on another ‘security.’”  A tale of two Liquids  Rival Japanese exchanges Coincheck and bitFlyer were beating Liquid domestically. JFSA lifted the business improvement order in 2021, enabling Liquid to do new business in Japan, but the company needed capital.  Two stories about Liquid’s financial health circulated. Earnings posted in public channels and announced in weekly calls made Liquid look like it was doing well, two former ground-level employees said. The company earned most of its money from listing new tokens, making $200,000 to $600,000 in good months, they said.  But two former senior staffers with knowledge of the company’s finances said that Liquid was only profitable for a few months in its lifetime, even with the bull runs of 2020 and 2021.  A source close to Liquid said that management stopped reporting metrics just months after new product launches if the numbers didn’t look good.  “This isn’t only for board decks, this is their own internal data,” the source said. “Mike could not stand failing.”  The $90M hack  On Aug. 19 2021, Liquid suspended withdrawals and deposits. It claimed that it had been hacked again. The size of the hack was later reported to be $90 million.  The hack brought down Liquid’s valuation, three former employees said. It was no longer a unicorn. A week after the hack, FTX extended a $120 million loan to the Japanese exchange.  Liquid said the money would go toward “accelerating new capital generation projects and providing critical liquidity.” (FTX has built its reputation on its derivatives offering and leverage products.)  Within two months, the JFSA awarded Liquid a Type 1 license, which allowed it to offer derivatives in the Japan market. Without a Type 1 license, exchanges can only offer spot trading. Without the loan from FTX, Liquid likely would not have obtained the Type 1 license, a former employee said.  There is still no official explanation for what happened in the hack. Liquid called in security teams, including crisis management firm Blackpanda, to investigate.  “Blackpanda has noted that to respect the confidentiality of all clients (past and prospective) in the crypto industry, it has declined to comment on the matter at hand,” CEO Gene Yu said.  Cold case  Forensic investigations into the August 2021 hack have stopped, two former employees said.  “Pausing a security review before a full report is made is effectively the same as not getting one,” said Josh Smith, founder of Blockwell, which has been a vendor and external token auditor for Liquid for five years.  Liquid held non-Japanese users’ assets in “warm” MPC wallets managed by Unbound because Singapore, which regulated that part of the business, does not require exchanges to hold assets in cold wallets.  A former employee said that before the hack, and without her knowledge, her access had been changed so that she could move funds out of wallets, a task well outside her job description. When she learned this had happened, the employee said, she worried she would be made a scapegoat for the hack.  A different employee would later claim in court papers that’s exactly what happened to her.  Wrongful-termination suit  On March 28, 2022, Liquid’s former head of product and marketing in Japan, Marisa McKnight, filed a wrongful termination suit against Quoine, the official legal entity, claiming that she was “scapegoated” for the hack.  Read more: Ex-Employee Claims Liquid Global Exchange 'Scapegoated' Her for $90M Hack  According to documents McKnight filed in Singapore’s High Court, she initially enjoyed a positive and close working relationship with Liquid’s senior management but later became “increasingly excluded and isolated.”  The documents claim that after McKnight resigned in September 2021 (the month after the hack), senior management at Liquid told her she was a suspect in the breach and requested she fly to Japan.  McKnight claims she refused to travel there because of the serious nature of management’s allegations, the two-week quarantine for travelers during COVID-19 and the fact the company did not book her a hotel or return flight. She also said in her claim that Kayamori threatened her. Even though she had resigned, Liquid terminated her with cause in October 2021.  Read more: Ex-Employee Claims Liquid Global Exchange 'Scapegoated' Her for $90M Hack  She is suing the company for the loss of 60 shares, worth $210,000, plus loss of reputation and loss of future employment opportunities. On April 19, Quoine issued its defense against McKnight’s claim, denying most of the allegations. She filed a reply on May 4 and the case is pending.  MPC wallets  Five other former employees said they thought it highly unlikely McKnight was involved in the hack.  According to Smith, the Liquid vendor, it was “nigh impossible” that McKnight hacked the exchange given her job title, the level of access it provides and the fact that she worked remotely at the time. Smith's first job in crypto was shutting down an ICO hack mid-sale without a dollar lost, and he has consulted on over a dozen hacks professionally.  Were Unbound’s keys circumvented? Or did Liquid undermine Unbound’s work with wallets whose entire private keys could be compromised?  “Nothing in Unbound’s MPC protection mechanism was compromised, and the theft was not due in any way, shape or form by a weakness in Unbound’s system,” Unbound CEO Yehuda Lindell told CoinDesk. Lindell added that he was “unable to disclose what the cause of the theft was.”  A veteran Liquid vendor said details of previous hacks indicate Liquid at least partly disregarded a fundamental aspect of a secure system, which is having distinct identities for different staff members so the company knows exactly who is accessing internal systems and when.  If that sounds too abstract, consider the bank card in your wallet. Even if you have a joint account with a family member, each of you has a unique card and PIN so your monthly statement shows exactly who made each ATM withdrawal or purchase. But if you shared your card and your PIN with a bunch of people, you’d have no way of knowing which one of them made which transaction.  “It doesn't matter how secure Unbound is if a single set of credentials into the Unbound account is shared around,” the Liquid vendor said.  Inside job?  A source close to Liquid at the time of the hack said that, in his opinion, it couldn't have been carried out by someone who wasn't directly involved in the implementation of the platform.  This source explained that a team called “DevOps” ran and maintained Liquid’s systems and servers. The DevOps staff had built a system only they knew how to operate. They were unafraid of managers who asked them to make changes.  Whoever did the hack “had to be someone who built it or worked with it frequently, because they had one chance to get this right ... and they got it right,” the source opined.  When asked to describe what happened in the form of a bank robbery analogy, this source said:  “Two bank security guards decide that they want to rob the place. In the middle of the night, they open up a seldom-used side door that leads to the outside. They toss many bundles of cash out that side door, then one ties up the other and beats him up. They are trying to make it look like an intruder came in that side door, caught the guard unawares, took his keys, grabbed the cash and fled to Neptune.”  Asked what Liquid should do to protect the assets of current users, this source said: “Suspend operations for 90 days, immediately fire anyone even tangentially involved with the design, construction or operation of the existing trading platform, and rebuild from scratch with untainted servers and engineers.”  FTX acquires Liquid  Five months after the hack, FTX announced it was acquiring Liquid Group. It intended to buy all shares, stock options and warrants from shareholders, according to contracts reviewed by CoinDesk. The dates on the contracts are blacked out.  A Liquid competitor, Japan crypto exchange bitFlyer, was recently valued at up to $370 million. Gehrke said that Liquid was likely sold at a discount to bitFlyer's value as a result of the hack, so possibly around $200 million. “From an FTX perspective, it's a bargain, right?” he said.  Another source close to Liquid said the company had around 40,000 shares. McKnight's lawsuit and a shareholder document reviewed by CoinDesk indicate the per-share price was $3510.41, so on the basis of that share count, the company would have sold for roughly $140 million.  FTX declined to comment on Liquid’s compliance and security issues and did not answer questions about its own due diligence on the acquisition.  By acquiring Liquid, FTX gained the ability to offer derivatives in the Japan market and picked up licenses on the cheap. Japan has been more cautious about approving new licenses for crypto exchanges over the last few years. Even Nasdaq-listed Coinbase, one of the world’s most successful exchanges, did not get a Japanese license until June 2021, three years after it announced plans to do business there.  On May 1, Kayamori emailed shareholders from FTX’s office in the Bahamas, confirming that the acquisition had closed and that Liquid would now operate under the name FTX Japan. FTX plans to migrate its Japanese customers to Liquid's platform. Investors can swap Liquid’s QASH token for FTX’s FTT.  In his email, Kayamori said his vision for Liquid had been to provide financial services for all.  “We knew it was not going to be easy but, to be honest, I never thought it would be this difficult either,” he wrote. “But as the 19th century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once said, what doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger. And we were able to withstand all challenges to become part of the FTX family.”  Liquid IEO / Token Listing ... by CoinDesk  Liquid Token Listing Fees by CoinDesk  11 20220328 HC S 258 of 2022 Statement of Claim - 202211445 by CoinDesk on Scribd  12 Liquid defence 20220419 HC S 258 of 2022 - Defence - 202211444 by CoinDesk on Scribd  13 20220504 Reply S 259 by CoinDesk on Scribd",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/17/how-not-to-run-a-cryptocurrency-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d448a10576d220ebe3f4bd101358ee1578bfc75-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
