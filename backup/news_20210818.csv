42397109,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYlIG,1629321694,¿Qué es un token cripto semifungible?,"La fungibilidad ha sido un tema constante en 2021, tras el ascenso meteórico de los tokens no fungibles (NFTs, por sus siglas en inglés). Pero, ¿qué pasa con los tokens semifungibles y cómo funcionan?      El interés en torno a los NFTs alcanzó niveles asombrosos en la primera mitad de este año. Los datos de NonFungible mostraron que las ventas de estos tokens se dispararon a más de $2.400 millones en el primer trimestre de este año, 20 veces más que en los tres meses anteriores. Ese impulso no ha mostrado signos de ralentización en lo que va de la segunda mitad del año: el principal mercado de NFT basado en Ethereum, OpenSea, experimentó un volumen de operaciones récord de $49 millones el 1 de agosto, por encima de su volumen medio diario de operaciones, de $8,3 millones. El precio medio de CryptoPunks —una de las primeras colecciones de NFT que debutaron en la blockchain de Ethereum— también estableció un récord durante el mismo mes, de 66.919 ETH por NFT (unos $220.000 al cierre de esta edición).    Read this article in English.    El crecimiento explosivo ha generado una nueva ola de innovación en torno a los activos no fungibles, incluida la aparición de un nuevo tipo de token semifungible (SFT) que comienza siendo fungible y finalmente se convierte en no fungible. Comencemos a desglosar estos términos.    Tokens fungibles    La mayoría de los criptoactivos que los inversores controlan y negocian regularmente son fungibles; es decir, son fácilmente intercambiables. Por ejemplo, si dos personas intercambiaran un ether por otro no habría pérdida de valor y ninguna de las partes saldría perdiendo. Esto se debe a que no hay distinción de valor entre dos ether o dos bitcoins (excluyendo las monedas conocidas como ""contaminadas"" o ""sucias"", las cuales han sido robadas o utilizadas en actividades ilícitas).      El dinero fiduciario, como los dólares estadounidenses, también es fungible. En otras palabras, un token es fungible cuando tiene la capacidad de ser intercambiado o sustituido por otros tokens del mismo tipo sin que su valor sufra una modificación.    Tokens no fungibles    Los NFTs son tokens basados en blockchain que pueden utilizarse para representar la propiedad digital de algo único y escaso, como obras de arte, objetos de colección, bandas sonoras o real estate virtual. Dado que cada artículo tiene un valor distinto basado en características inherentes —quién lo creó o su rareza, por ejemplo—, los NFTs no pueden intercambiarse mutuamente como el ether o los dólares estadounidenses. Por ejemplo, una tarjeta de béisbol digital no podría intercambiarse por una parcela de tierra virtual, ya que los dos son activos completamente diferentes. Eso, sin tener en cuenta que la tarjeta de béisbol digital podría formar parte de una colección excepcionalmente rara, mientras que la parcela de terreno virtual podría estar en una ubicación no deseada.      El hecho de que los NFTs se almacenen en una cadena de bloques significa que cada token tiene las siguientes características:    Indivisible: no es posible comprar fracciones de NFTs.  Indestructible: no pueden ser destruidos o eliminados.  Inmutable: es imposible cambiar la información subyacente una vez almacenada.  Verificable: como los NFTs se almacenan en blockchains públicas, la autenticidad y la propiedad pueden ser fácilmente verificadas por cualquier persona en cualquier momento.  ¿Qué son los tokens semifungibles?    Los SFTs representan un grupo relativamente nuevo de tokens que pueden ser tanto fungibles como no fungibles durante su ciclo de vida. Inicialmente, los SFTs actúan como los tokens fungibles normales en el sentido de que pueden negociarse de igual a igual con otros SFTs idénticos.      Por ejemplo, un token que representa un vale válido de $10 de Amazon tendría el mismo valor que un vale idéntico con la misma fecha de caducidad y, por tanto, sería intercambiable.      El factor distintivo que hace que estos tipos especiales de tokens sean semi-fungibles es que, una vez canjeados, los tokens fungibles pierden su valor nominal. Esa pérdida de valor intercambiable hace que los tokens caducados no sean fungibles.      Otra forma de entenderlo es imaginando que se posee una ficha que representa una entrada para el último concierto de los Beatles. La entrada tendría un valor nominal y podría cambiarse por otra idéntica, siempre que se tratara del mismo grupo musical, en la misma fecha y en la misma zona de asientos. Una vez finalizado el concierto, la ficha que representa la entrada se convertiría en un objeto de colección y tendría un valor totalmente nuevo. También significaría que la ficha ya no podría cambiarse por una entrada de concierto válida del mismo valor nominal inicial para ver a una banda diferente.      Ese proceso de transformación de un token fungible a uno no fungible al canjearlo es el que da nombre a los semi fungibles.    Cómo crearlos    Hoy en día es posible acuñar SFTs utilizando el estándar ERC-1155 de Ethereum. Se trata de uno de los varios estándares de tokens de Ethereum; es decir, planos para crear tokens en la blockchain de Ethereum que son compatibles con todos los demás proyectos basados en el ERC.      El estándar ERC-1155 fue desarrollado por los desarrolladores de juegos de blockchain Enjin, Horizon Games y The Sandbox en 2017, y es esencialmente una combinación de los estándares ERC-20 (token fungible) y ERC-721 (token no fungible). Esto permite crear y gestionar tanto tokens fungibles como no fungibles mediante un único contrato inteligente, un programa informático que se autoejecuta cuando se dan determinadas condiciones.      Los SFTs son especialmente útiles en el sector de los juegos, donde hay elementos fungibles como la moneda de un juego —lingotes de oro o V-Bucks, por ejemplo— así como artículos no fungibles, como coleccionables y armas. Esto significa que las empresas de juegos pueden crear ambos tipos de tokens y asegurarse de que sean interoperables para que los jugadores puedan intercambiar fácilmente cosas como armas por lingotes de oro, y viceversa",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ENJ | ETH,"Anatol Antonovici, Andrés Engler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/18/que-es-un-token-cripto-semifungible,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/030f2e76483c9bb2ef69411352e6b1a9711d6dd6-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397103,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYlBN,1629319208,Poly Network Attacker Threatens to Delay Return of Funds,"The hacker who carried out a $600 million-plus exploit on the blockchain protocol Poly Network has threatened to delay the full return of funds until at least next week.      ""YOUR ESSAYS ARE VERY CONVINCING WHILE YOUR ACTIONS ARE SHOWING YOUR DISTRUST, WHAT A FUNNY GAME,"" the attacker, identified on the blockchain-tracking website Etherscan as ""Poly Network Exploiter 1,"" wrote Wednesday in a transaction data field on the Ethereum blockchain.      The saga has already dragged into its second week, as executives behind the project plead with the attacker to return the looted funds from the Aug. 10 attack. They have created a destination account for the return of the funds, but it requires multiple signatures to unlock the funds, and the attacker's cooperation is needed.      ""I AM NOT READY TO PUBLISH THE KEY IN THIS WEEK,"" the attacker wrote.      In what appeared to be a reply, a subsequent message posted on Ethereum and signed ""Poly Network Team"" said that ""we still hope you can provide the key to us this week, because thousands of users are waiting to get their assets back.""      ""The sooner the asset recovery can be carried out, the more negative emotions will be avoided,"" the message read. ""We are unlikely to get a proper rest until we fully return the user assets.""      The Polygon Network negotiators have referred to the attacker as “Mr. White Hat” – ostensibly a reference to a “white hat” attacker who tries to exploit vulnerabilities in a protocol to help expose and ultimately fix bugs or loopholes in the underlying code.    Bounty paid in ETH?    They have also promised to send the attacker a $500,000 bounty for helping to identify a vulnerability in the protocol.      And in the message on Wednesday, the Poly Network Team address wrote that ""we still decided to go ahead and transfer 160 ETH"" to an address associated with the attacker. The dollar equivalent of 160 units of ether (ETH) works out to roughly $500,000.      But as of press time, CoinDesk could not independently confirm that such a transfer had been made.      Poly Network officials didn't immediately reply to a request for comment on the latest blockchain banter.      The transparency of blockchain data has turned the back-and-forth negotiations between the attacker and Poly Network's staff into a surprisingly suspenseful drama playing out in public.      As reported previously by CoinDesk, cryptocurrency users have sent dozens of complimentary messages to the attacker pleading for a share of the loot, and some of them have even used the Ethereum blockchain to send small increments of cryptocurrency as tips.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/18/poly-network-attacker-threatens-to-delay-return-of-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e5527a6e9d6817185dbf7f3bc774dad75e004f9-1300x903.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376421,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ATpB,1629319008,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Trades Sideways as Institutional Demand Expected to Rise,"Bitcoin is roughly flat over the past 24 hours as short-term momentum fades. The past few days have been relatively quiet in the crypto market, which typically precedes periods of higher volatility. Some analysts expect crypto prices to consolidate, albeit with the continued relative outperformance of altcoins such as ether and cardano.      Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was trading at around $45,400 at press time and is up 55% year to date, compared with a 19% return for the S&P 500 and a 30% return in commodities over the same period.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $44,888, -0.98%  Ether (ETH) $3026.5, -2.31%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4400.3, -1.07%  Gold: $1785.3, -0.03%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.272%, compared with 1.262% on Tuesday    Analysts are also watching institutional flows throughout the crypto market. A review of regulatory documents reveals that a parade of megabanks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America, and even states such as Tennessee, have told securities regulators they held Coinbase stock (NASDAQ: COIN) on June 30, reports CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson.      But not all investors are dedicated to their crypto holdings. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest continued to reduce its holdings of COIN and the Grayscale Investment Trust (GBTC) in the past week, according to Chainchatter and Wu Blockchain. Wood is a noted crypto investor. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.    Crypto could attract a wall of institutional money, says LMAX CEO    Large institutions are warming up to cryptocurrencies and will demand more robust trading infrastructure. “There is a wall of institutional money, and we could see exciting new entrants into the custodian, credit intermediation, and aggregation space,” David Mercer, CEO of LMAX Group, a global institutional exchange, said in an interview.      “Forty percent of our digital-asset clients also trade FX (foreign exchange) and 34 of the world’s biggest banks connect with us,” Mercer said.      LMAX Digital is an institutional cryptocurrency exchange operated by LMAX Group.      Mercer stated that some institutional clients have increased their exposure to crypto from a minority holding to a majority holding. And although altcoins are popular, Mercer does not see ether taking over bitcoin in the near-term.      Institutions face risks with crypto that are different from traditional foreign exchange markets, according to Mercer. For example, “capturing differences in spot prices is very capital intensive and institutions are trading with a lot of unknown counterparties, including exchanges,” Mercer said.      The reliability of technology, depth of liquidity and execution are some important factors that institutions consider when selecting a trading venue, according to a LMAX Digital survey.      In general, Mercer is bullish on cryptocurrencies and expects the total market cap to increase by $5 trillion within the next two years with major financial institutions paying more attention to the field. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies stands at $1.93 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.      “For me it’s a no-brainer that that amount of money will enter the crypto space, and is looking for a home, and looking for assets to invest in. When one bulge-bracket bank starts trading actively for their clients, the others will follow,"" Mercer said.    Crypto adoption shifts to emerging markets    Crypto adoption has increased 23-fold globally over the past year with India, Pakistan, Ukraine and other emerging markets driving the surge, Chainalysis said in a report Wednesday, as CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reports.      In its “2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index,” Chainalysis found that Chinese and U.S. positions as crypto adoption leaders have been waning amid the Chinese crackdown on crypto trading and the growing role of major financial institutions in crypto markets.      The annual study underscores that crypto adoption is accelerating quickly worldwide and that its use is shifting to markets that not long ago were more moderately active on the crypto front. Meanwhile, those markets that were previously at the forefront are confronting big changes with regulations and financial services.      Instead of measuring crypto trading volume, which favors countries with high levels of professional and institutional adoption, Chainalysis focused on blockchain activity by non-professional and individual crypto users. That methodology encompasses crypto adoption in more ordinary activities, including savings, rather than just trading and speculation.    Bitcoin dominance decline    The market dominance of bitcoin, or the largest cryptocurrency’s value as a share of the overall market, declined to 44% over the past week. The relative market cap loss occurred as altcoins such as ether and cardano outperformed bitcoin during the recent crypto rally.      “Despite bitcoin and ether’s excellent performance this year, neither asset is anywhere close to cardano’s return,” Alexandra Clark, a sales trader at U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Cardano is up about 65% month to date, compared with a 21% rise in ETH and a 14% rise in BTC over the same period.      Clark sees future potential for cardano driven by network upgrades.      “Cardano’s Alonzo mainnet hard fork, which is scheduled for Sept. 12 and is one of the most anticipated events in the crypto calendar, will help cardano compete on equal terms with Ethereum,” Clark wrote. “Cardano will tackle one of the asset’s biggest deficiencies by allowing users to run smart contracts on the network.""    Slowdown in money supply    The slowdown in global money supply could weigh on bitcoin, according to Stifel, a global investment bank. Global central banks are preparing to tighten policy as unprecedented amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus is absorbed in the economy. And with some asset prices running high, analysts at Stifel expect a repricing of speculative markets such as cryptocurrencies.      On Wednesday, minutes from the July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting showed most Fed officials expected to scale down easy money policies this year.    Altcoin roundup  Avalanche’s AVAX Token Jumps: Avalanche’s AVAX token surged Wednesday after the blockchain announced plans for a $180 million “liquidity mining incentive program” to scale in decentralized finance, or DeFi. The token was up by 18.8% in the last 24 hours at press time, trading at $26.9. The price has more than doubled in the past month, according to data from Messari. The Avalanche Foundation said in a press release the DeFi incentive program titled “Avalanche Rush” will bring top DeFi applications to the platform, including Aave and Curve.  White hats defused a potential $350M heist on SushiSwap: A group of people in the crypto community, led by crypto investment firm Paradigm’s research partner, Sam Sun, may have just prevented SushiSwap’s token fundraising platform Miso from losing more than $350 million worth of ether after the group discovered and fixed a bug on the platform in less than five hours. Because of the collective efforts, SushiSwap says no funds have been lost. According to a post published by SushiSwap on Monday, Sun and his colleagues Georgios Konstantopoulos and Daniel Robinson – all from San Francisco-based crypto investment firm Paradigm – reached out to the team at Sushi to alert them to “a vulnerability” on the “Dutch auction” contract on the Miso platform.  Rally submits plan to decentralize itself: Social token startup Rally has submitted a proposal to decentralize itself into an array of entities – some corporate, other community controlled – that would independently build out the Rally ecosystem. The road map would see the crypto-based “creator coin” platform split up into a venture studio, an Asia-based outpost, a Swiss nonprofit, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and a Delaware-based corporation that would carry the Rally name.

Cryptocurrency-based revenue for the second quarter was $233 million, versus just $5 million in the year-ago quarter.  Robinhood further specified that 62% of its cryptocurrency revenues in the second quarter came from the trading of dogecoin, up from 34% in the first quarter.  Robinhood noted this heavy reliance as a risk in its earnings report. “If demand for transactions in dogecoin declines and is not replaced by new demand for other cryptocurrencies available for trading on our platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected,” the company wrote.  Wednesday’s report was Robinhood’s first earnings report as a public company. Overall, the company lost an adjusted $2.16 per share, compared to consensus estimates for a loss of 26 cents per share. It recorded revenue of $565 million, ahead of estimates for $559.5 million.  The company also warned of lower revenue expectations for the third quarter. ""For the three months ended Sept 30, 2021, we expect seasonal headwinds and lower trading activity across the industry to result in lower revenues and considerably fewer funded accounts than in the prior quarter,"" the company wrote.  Shares were down almost 6% in after-hours trading to $46.94 on Wednesday following the release of the report.

42376414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ATit,1629317708,VanEck Adds to ETF Applications With Ether Futures Filing,"Fund manager VanEck filed for an ethereum-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Wednesday that would seek to sidestep U.S. regulators’ crypto ETF blockade by trading ether indirectly.      The Ethereum Strategy ETF would invest in ether futures contracts, Canada’s approved ether ETFs, private ether funds and exchange-traded products with exposure to ether. But it won’t buy the digital asset itself, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      VanEck has already filed to register a pure-play ether ETF. But that product’s fate remains unclear and is likely tied to that of over a dozen bitcoin ETF bids (all so-called “33 Act” products) that are also before the SEC.      By contrast, VanEck’s indirect ether ETF is a “40 Act” fund. That ETF structure likely carries more investor protections than its 33 Act counterpart, which may be an important distinction for SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.      Earlier this month, Gensler hinted the SEC may look more favorably upon bitcoin ETFs that only trade futures contracts. He didn't comment more broadly on crypto ETFs. Ether and bitcoin are the only two crypto assets approved for futures trading in the U.S.      That VanEck’s proposed fund would trade a broad array of ether products might fall outside Gensler’s guardrails.

""Some participants cited various potential risks to financial stability including the risks associated with expanded use of cryptocurrencies,"" according to minutes of the July 27-28 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This is the panel at the U.S. central bank that sets monetary policy, and the interest-rate decisions announced after its monthly meetings are the subject of much soothsaying and Kremlinology (in the figurative sense).      While officials from the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and regional Fed banks have expressed a range of views about crypto in recent months, from welcoming to wary, this appears to be the first time the topic has come up in the FOMC.      As such, it's another sign the industry has ""arrived,"" following its role holding up the $1 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress.      Released Wednesday, the minutes did not say which members of the 11-seat committee voiced these concerns.      A few officials also highlighted the need to regulate stablecoins, according to the minutes.      The officials noted the “fragility and lack of transparency associated with stablecoins, the importance of monitoring them closely, and the need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework to address any risks to financial stability associated with such products,” according to the minutes.      While the document does not elaborate, one reason FOMC members may be concerned is the investments made by issuers of stablecoins, which are supposed to be redeemable 1-for-1 with dollars, and the potential for a sell-off in the underlying assets should these outfits be hit with a high number of redemption requests simultaneously.      “There’s increasing evidence that [stablecoins] are material players in the commercial paper market and operating like unregulated money market funds – which aren’t even stable themselves,"" Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, an initiative focused on understanding financial crises, told CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/18/crypto-made-the-agenda-at-last-months-fed-meeting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38f6237d3a3edf39ca42fbc55e877cbfc8ec592d-1385x865.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As pointed out by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju in a post, indicators could suggest ETH will reach its ATH quicker than BTC in the long term. The exchange netflow is an indicator that depends on two metrics: the inflow and the outflow. The former is the total amount of the asset moving from personal wallets to exchanges. While the latter is just the opposite; it&apos;s the total amount of Ethereum (or Bitcoin) exiting exchange wallets. When the value of the inflow goes up, it means more crypto is being sent to exchanges for selling or altcoin purchasing purposes. On the other hand, when the outflow indicator shows an uptick, it implies more investors are interested in hodling their coins, or perhaps selling them through OTC deals. Related Reading | Bullish Signal That Resulted In A 250% Increase In Bitcoin Is Getting Triggered Again The netflow metric for Bitcoin or Ethereum is just the difference of the above two indicators.

The road map would see the crypto-based ""creator coin"" platform split into a venture studio, an Asia-based outpost, a Swiss nonprofit, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and a Delaware-based corporation that would carry the Rally name.      “Today, we lay out our plans for the community to decide the future of the network,” Rally founder Kevin Chou wrote in the proposal. The vote will conclude on Aug. 25.      An “aye” from RLY holders would make Rally the latest crypto project to embrace self-decentralization. Some have done so radically: Shuttered ShapeShift’s legacy operations are now run exclusively by FOX token holders through a DAO. The Maker Foundation also plans to hand its decentralized finance (DeFi) keys back to a DAO.      Rally would not be as aggressive. Its centerpiece entity would be run by appointed executives, including prospective CEO Bremner Morris, who is already Rally’s community-appointed chief marketing officer.      Rally’s plans are roughly comparable with Blockstack’s (now “Stacks”) effort in 2018 to slice itself into five entities. There are some key differences, though. For starters, Rally’s decentralization plan must first win community support.      “We're trying to take it a step further by really establishing a very community-focused DAO on top of the ecosystem as well,” Chou told CoinDesk in an interview.

42376417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ATlP,1629310669,Avalanche's AVAX Token Jumps on $180M Incentive Program,"The price of AVAX, the token of the Avalanche platform, surged Wednesday after Avalanche announced plans for a $180 million ""liquidity mining incentive program"" to increase its scale in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).      The token was up by 16% in the last 24 hours at press time, trading at $27.69. The price has more than doubled in the past month, according to data from Messari.      The Avalanche Foundation said in a press release that a $180 million DeFi incentive program titled “Avalanche Rush” will bring top DeFi applications to the platform, including Aave and Curve. Avalanche is a platform that's used to build custom blockchain networks and decentralized applications, knowns as ""dapps.""      “Aptly dubbed ‘Avalanche Rush,’ the program will lead exactly to that, an avalanche of hot money rushing towards AVAX,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital.      The token is still well off its all-time high of about $59 that it hit six months ago, according to CoinGeko.      “In the spirit of strength in numbers, strong partnerships, such as those utilized by Polygon with Curve, Aave and others, is a better strategy to attract and to retain users as opposed to re-inventing the wheel on their own,” Vinokourov said.      Often dubbed as an alternative to the Ethereum blockchain, Avalanche says the fact that it processes thousands of transactions per second and has low fees makes it a “haven for Ethereum defectors,” according to Messari research. It is not a single-blockchain network like Ethereum as it features multiple chains that perform different functions.      ""As DeFi becomes more and more popular, it becomes clear that the Ethereum blockchain is currently struggling to fit all the activity. Thus, it is important to expand to other chains and layer 2s (L2s),” Michael Egorov, CEO at Curve Finance, said in the press release.      “We find Avalanche offering an excellent opportunity with its unique decentralized consensus mechanism, high throughput and low transaction fees,"" he added.

42376413,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AThd,1629307181,Cathie Wood vs. Michael Burry Isn’t About Tesla – It’s About Inflation,"Two of America's most respected investors, each with their own claim on the affections of cryptocurrency bulls, are locking horns over their conflicting views of the economic future. On one side is Cathie Wood, head of Ark Invest, whose ARKK Innovation ETF holds bullish positions on companies like Tesla and Coinbase. On the other side is Michael Burry, whose 2007 bet against the housing market, just before it triggered a financial crisis and the Great Recession, has turned him into a near-mythic doomsayer.      On Monday, it was reported that Burry, through his Scion Asset Management fund, is betting against the success of Wood’s innovation ETF to the tune of 235,500 shares shorted, or about $31 million worth of put options. The conflict has been largely framed as one between data-driven fundamental investing and a more ideas-driven, big-picture approach. Analysts who agree with Burry’s bet have pointed out the massively inflated price-earnings ratio of ARKK holdings. (This Twitter fusillade from investor Christopher Bloomstran is a blistering must-read.)    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insight Columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    That debate is exemplified by ARKK’s very large position in Tesla – an automaker whose market cap is larger than the next five largest auto companies combined, yet only occasionally turns a profit. Wood, as chronicled in CoinDesk’s in-depth profile, was vaulted into the upper tier of investors by her unwavering faith in Tesla during the company’s dark stretch in 2018. Even before shorting ARKK, Burry had a huge $534 million short position against Tesla, aligning him with the “Tesla Q” skeptics who believe that Elon Musk’s big promises about things like full self-driving are hot air.      But this is just the sexy philosophical surface of the debate. Look closer, and the face-off between Wood and Burry is about something both simpler and bigger: their different thinking about inflation.      Burry, as befits his doomsaying reputation, is a notorious inflation hawk who in February compared U.S. monetary policy to Weimar Germany. That’s a widely shared perspective among Bitcoin advocates. Burry believes inflation spells doom for the kinds of companies ARKK holds, including, somewhat ironically, Coinbase.      Inflation is a threat to the valuation of growth or “innovation” stocks largely because even moderate sustained inflation would lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to rein in the money supply. Because so few of ARKK’s portfolio companies are profitable, they can be expected to need continued cash through loans or other financing as they grow. Higher base interest rates make that capital more expensive. (It would have a similar or even stronger effect on venture capital and private-equity hedge funds.)      Wood, meanwhile, says she now believes current inflation is transitory, correctly pointing out that commodity and used car prices are crashing back to earth. In a tweet thread responding to reports of Burry’s short position, she argued, “The equity market is likely to reward disruptive innovation strategies once again when headline inflation breaks and/or fears of recession increase.”      This is perhaps a bit surprising from Wood, who had supported the re-election of Donald Trump and so might be expected to join the mostly right-leaning inflation hawks. Her contrary position might show a flexible mind willing to reassess conditions on the ground. On the other hand, it might be a matter of convenience, since predicting low inflation makes her fund’s thesis look better.      And Wood certainly has a motive to talk her own book. After a sustained run of impressive annual returns around 30%, ARKK returned a staggering 150% in 2020, thanks to positions in companies like Zoom that saw outsized gains during the pandemic. That success has both grown the balance sheet and attracted more capital, and ARKK now manages nearly $22 billion, up from $9 billion in October of last year.      But Wood’s impressive returns have, at least for the moment, dried up. ARKK is down 6% so far this year, while the Dow Jones big-cap index is up 20%. Ouch.    Read more: Galaxy Digital Reports Q2 Loss of $176M on Drop in Crypto Prices    (Regardless of your current inflation expectations, there’s some universal investment wisdom to be gleaned here: If you’ve held ARKK for a while, you’re probably still laughing despite recent losses. But if you bought in after Wood’s stroke of 2020 pandemic good fortune, you are getting waaaaashed, brother.)      There is another angle on the inflation question, though, which lurks just under the surface of Wood’s thesis. Some argue that a loose money supply has been good for speculative investments as household saving rates increase and more participants put money in the stock and crypto markets, a phenomenon often referred to as “asset price inflation.” (Though there’s serious debate over whether calling this a form of “inflation” is accurate.)      One important implication of the asset inflation theory is that money going into bitcoin or Tesla stock isn’t making demands on real goods. That means rising asset prices could actually be reducing real inflation pressures and the threat of higher interest rates. That would mean capital could stay cheap for innovators, even as money printing pumped up speculative assets.      Wood signed off a long rebuttal of Burry with this: “I do not believe that [Burry] understands the fundamentals that are creating explosive growth and investment opportunities in the innovation space.” For ARKK, those fundamentals could actually include continued heavy U.S. public spending – as long as Wood and her fellow travelers can coax enough of that cash into their own high-risk bets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42376419,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ATmf,1629306361,Bitcoin Lightning Network Growth Passes New Milestones,"The Lightning Network – a layer 2 payment product built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that enables secure, private and near-instantaneous transactions at little to no cost – has surpassed 25,000 active nodes for the first time, an indication that the network is growing stronger with more nodes and more channels.      During the past 30 days, the number of active nodes has risen 8% to 25,010. A node is essentially a “user” on the network who sets up their computer to interact with other nodes. That way, they can send, verify and receive information – in this case, bitcoins.      As a decentralized network, the Lightning Network has no central data server that stores all of the transactions or interactions between users. Instead, its decentralized network of distributed nodes keeps track of the data, or part of it.    Read more: Nodes on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Double in 3 Months    In order to reduce congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Lightning Network allows users to route their transactions through off-chain channels. All of the transactions that pass through a channel are rewritten into a single transaction and settled on the Bitcoin network, allowing for millions of transactions to be made in a matter of seconds. These channels run between the various nodes that have chosen to connect in this way.      Not every node, however, operates a channel. Currently, the number of nodes with channels is 14,419, or about 58% of all nodes. The remaining 42% are simply there, for the time being, at least.      But for those who do choose to open and fund a Lightning Network channel, there is the potential to earn yield.    Earning yield on the Lightning Network    In order to open a channel, node operators have to “fund” it with a small amount of BTC. Right now that average funding amount is about 0.035 BTC. Whatever amount is in that channel represents the maximum value of any transaction that can be routed through that channel. In return for providing that channel liquidity, node operators collect a small fee when a transaction routes through one of their channels.      In the Lightning Network, not every node is connected to every other node; that would require far too much storage per node. Usually a transaction has to “hop” through channels, from one node to the next in order to find a path to its final destination. To accomplish that, the Lightning Network uses onion routing from the Tor Network, a privacy-based network protected by encryption, which essentially allows a transaction to hop from node to node until it reaches a target.      Each hop through a channel requires its own fee – so the fewer hops, the better. Currently, the average hop distance is 8.8 hops.      Since we last reported on July 15, the number of channels has increased to 65,739 and expanded their capacity by roughly 78%, from 1,800 to over 2,300 BTC, according to data from 1ml.      The increase in the number of channels means that there are more connections between the nodes. Since every single jump between nodes costs a fee, having more channels available increases the chances of finding a more efficient route for the transaction’s final destination. Thus, increased connectivity can greatly reduce the fees associated with sending transactions.    Read more: Becoming Self-Sovereign: How to Set Up a Bitcoin Node, With Lightning    Greater connectivity and more channels also translates to more competition in facilitating transactions. Average fees have dropped below the base fee. Although the base fee for passing through a node’s channels is 1 sat, the median fee that is being charged is only 0.000006 SAT/SAT spent or $0.000000003018/SAT spent. (A ""sat"" is a satoshi, the smallest unit of a bitcoin.)      Furthermore, the network capacity signifies a more developed network because it means that cumulatively, users have “invested” in the network. In order for transactions to hop from node to node, each channel must be funded adequately. The higher the capacity, the more funds can be sent.    Driving forces    The growth is, in part, due to the increasing need for a solution to Bitcoin’s scalability problem, which states that Bitcoin is limited to only seven transactions per second on the base layer. Layered networks like Lightning and sidechains like Liquid have gotten the attention of big names in crypto like Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, whose Twitter user name now includes a Lightning bolt for the Lightning network.      Earlier this summer, the Lightning Network made headlines when Jack Mallers, CEO of payments company Strike, announced the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador. In partnership with the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, Mallers’ Lightning-based payment app Strike was implemented throughout the country.      Now, Mallers is taking an aggressive stance against big centralized exchanges like Coinbase by bringing on app bitcoin purchase fees to near zero.

The app's wait list went live today with a full launch slated for later this month.      “One of the barriers to entry with bitcoin is that it's money, but it's not visible for everyday people,” Will Reeves, Fold’s CEO and co-founder, told CoinDesk. “This augmented reality experience allows people to see bitcoin, to pick it up, and essentially brings the world of bitcoin, which exists in zeros and ones, and makes it tangible.”      Fold is not the first to make a game out of bitcoin. In recent years, gamification in crypto – and finance in general – has been on the rise, from Robinhood adding game-like features to its investing platform to all-out crypto adventures like Satoshi’s Treasure, which used a bitcoin prize to promote tokens.    Read more: Crypto Venture Studio Thesis Raises $21M to Keep Building    Fold cardholders will be able to access the AR feature every hour, while users who only have the app will be able to access it once per day. Bitcoin prizes range from what Reeves describes as “a couple satoshis” to “a gold mine” of bitcoin. A satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin.      During the current testing period, Fold will give away about $100,000 worth of bitcoin, but Reeves said the number would fluctuate in future months depending on sponsorship and user interaction levels.      The launch of Fold’s new AR feature coincides with the removal of all sign-up and activation fees associated with its Spin debit card, which offers rewards of up to 25% back in bitcoin on purchases.

Between July 2014 and December 2017, Helix processed a reported 354,468 BTC for drug vendors on Alphabay and other marketplaces. At the time of transaction, this sum was worth over $311 million. At today's prices, Helix processed over $16 billion worth of bitcoin.      Harmon was arrested in Ohio in February 2020, and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitter business and money transmission without a license. Last October, Harmon was ordered to pay a $60 million civil penalty.      The case against Harmon was the first time the Department of Justice (DOJ) and associated financial watchdogs like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) called bitcoin mixing services illegal.      In a press statement after Harmon’s arrest, Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski wrote: “This indictment underscores that seeking to obscure virtual currency transactions in this way is a crime.”    Read more: US DOJ Calls Bitcoin Mixing ‘a Crime’ in Arrest of Software Developer    Many in the crypto community have expressed concern that Harmon’s arrest set a precedent where creating a bitcoin mixer is considered unlawful and any service that uses obfuscation tactics to conceal bitcoin’s publicly accessible path could face legal pushback. There are multiple technologies for “mixing” bitcoin payments, however. Some are clearly illegal, but with others, the matter is murky.      While pleading guilty, Harmon’s lawyer clarified that Helix’s double-blind nature meant that Harmon did not know the number or value of the transactions he processed.      The prosecution described Harmon’s plea deal as “lenient” due to an unspecified “cooperation agreement.”      However, Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at TRM Labs, a firm that detects crypto fraud and crime, said Harmon is not getting off lightly.      ""Quite the opposite. He pled guilty to the lead charge in the indictment – money laundering conspiracy – which carries a 20-year maximum sentence and his sentencing guideline range is life in prison,"" Redbord said. ""He now has to provide valuable information to the government in order for them to seek a downward departure from the court. The result makes sense for both sides.""      Harmon, who remains on release pending sentencing, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison as well as what his lawyer describes as “a large and lengthy forfeiture agreement.”      UPDATE (Aug. 18, 2021, 15:35 UTC): Adds additional comment.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Cheyenne Ligon, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/18/bitcoin-mixing-ceo-harmon-pleads-guilty-to-us-money-laundering-charge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfe5db66792e80729fe07e1f38883d53032c2c5a-1392x786.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376418,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ATnv,1629297257,How Much Energy Does Bitcoin Use?,"As new miners join the fray and the Bitcoin network continues to grow, so too does its energy usage.      It’s easy to read the headlines and assume that bitcoin, and indeed every other cryptocurrency, must be significantly contributing to climate change. In May, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted his concerns that “cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels ... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.” Shortly after, bitcoin’s value tumbled 15%. The growing global pressure on bitcoin miners to use more renewable energy has led to the creation of initiatives like the Bitcoin Mining Council and pushed mindful investors to seek out “greener” cryptocurrencies.      As of mid-July, a single bitcoin transaction required 1719.51 kilowatt hours (kWh) - where a kWh is the amount of energy a 1,000-watt appliance uses in over an hour. To put that in perspective, that is about 59 days’ worth of power consumed by an average U.S. household. On an average day, 240,000 bitcoin transactions are sent over the network.    How does bitcoin use power?    Often referred to as the new gold rush, it can be hard to comprehend how something with no physical manifestation can be so resource-intensive. The Bitcoin network relies on thousands of miners running energy intensive machines 24/7 to verify and add transactions to the blockchain. This system is known as “proof-of-work.”      Bitcoin’s energy usage depends on how many miners are operating on its network at any given time. These miners must compete against each other to win the right to add the next block to the blockchain and earn rewards. The competitive structure results in a lot of wasted energy as only one miner can add a new block every 10 minutes.      To maintain a competitive advantage over other miners, many larger operations are forced to scale up or upgrade their equipment. As a result, there are now dozens of mining facilities all over the world that have hundreds, if not thousands, of rigs running constantly. One of the byproducts of these industrial-scale operations is heat. Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners – the leading type of specialized computing equipment used for mining cryptocurrencies – produce a lot of heat when performing hashing functions and need to be kept cool to prevent them from becoming less efficient or burning out. Smaller operations might only need fans and a cool climate to keep temperatures in check, but large mining facilities require industrial-style cooling systems. That further increases the amount of energy consumed.    Why is this energy consumption a problem?    While the mining industry’s steering toward cleaner energy, a large portion of the electricity consumed by the Bitcoin network is still generated from nonrenewable sources, like coal-burning power plants. It’s well understood that burning fossil fuels like coal releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – the main driver of climate change. That means that the more mining computers that join the network, the more demand there will be to create and consume energy.      Energy demands around bitcoin have long been a concern, especially now that we have seen the network quadruple since its last peak in 2017. And the network is still maturing. At its present level, Bitcoin consumes 81.51 terawatt hours (TWh) annually. If it were a country, it would rank as number 39 for annual electricity consumption, ahead of Austria and Venezuela.    Understanding the environmental impact    It is important to note that there is a difference between electricity consumption and environmental/carbon footprint. There is no doubt that bitcoin’s miners require large amounts of electricity. But to understand the ecological impact, there needs to be information about where miners source their energy. Bitcoin itself does not inherently produce extra carbon emissions because any source of electricity can technically power the network. As of September 2020, researchers at the Cambridge Center of Alternative Finance (CCAF) found that 62% of global miners relied on hydropower, 38% used coal, and 39% used some combination of wind, solar or geothermal energy. But it is estimated that only 39% of bitcoin’s energy consumption is carbon neutral.      While other industries need specific environments and conditions, bitcoin can capitalize on energy sources that are inaccessible to others. In the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, large quantities of excess hydropower were harvested to power the growing mining factories in China. During the rainy season, these provinces could be responsible for 50% of all mining operations worldwide. But in June, the Chinese government imposed restrictions on cryptocurrency mining. That has resulted in mining operations migrating to countries like Kazakhstan, which rely more heavily on fossil fuel-based electricity.    How bitcoin compares to traditional banking    While Bitcoin’s electricity consumption may seem like a lot, it pales in comparison to the energy consumed by traditional banks. The entire bitcoin ecosystem is said to use less than half of the energy banking systems require. That is not too surprising when you take into account the sheer number of physical branches, printing facilities, ATMs, data centers, card machines and secure transport vehicles required to support the fiat currency system.    The future of bitcoin's energy use    There’s been a notable push in 2021 to make bitcoin mining, and indeed other cryptocurrency mining, more sustainable and environmentally friendly. The Crypto Climate Accord advocates for the cryptocurrency industry to seek out new electricity sources and aims to provide crypto companies “an open-source toolbox of tech solutions” to help the industry achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.      Finally, there may be less reason to worry than the alarming headlines proclaim. Bitcoin’s miners are unlikely to increase at the same scale as they did a few years back. That is in part due to bitcoin halving, which is built into the Bitcoin blockchain and reduces the block rewards miners get every four years. So unless bitcoin’s value continues to rise to compensate for the drop, miners will need to shift toward more efficient equipment and cheaper sources of energy in order to maintain margins and keep large-scale mining operations viable.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING,Annika Feign,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/18/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-use,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a8fcde68f22c07cc95b12f405837cd5ae421e23-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The blog post follows reports of the increased obstacles that Facebook's stablecoin project faces. After being introduced in June 2019, Libra ran into resistance from global regulators. The project, which was rebranded as Diem in December, has yet to launch.  Only offering fiat currency within Novi would still provide value, Marcus wrote, though he added: “I strongly believe if there was ever a chance to create an open, interoperable protocol for money on the internet and truly change the game for people and businesses around the world, it is now.”  Marcus noted that Facebook has secured licenses and approvals for Novi in nearly every state in the U.S., and said, “We will not launch anywhere we have not yet received such clearances.”  Read more: Senator Warren Urges ‘Coordinated and Holistic’ Response to ‘Dangers’ of Crypto",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET,Nelson Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/18/facebook-novi-digital-wallet-is-ready-to-come-to-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31bf8419e26548df5bafc0906e27c289f0a359fc-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376403,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ATTn,1629293104,‘Like-to-Earn’ NFT Platform RARA Looks to Monetize the Future of Online Engagement,"What if social interactions online – like bidding on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or hosting an online auction – could earn you money? How do you make expressing yourself on the internet valuable?      Those are the questions the RARA.social app for is trying to answer.      RARA’s so-called “like-to-earn” model aims to reward active community members and participants with RARA’s native tokens in exchange for contributing to the platform, either through bidding on or curating NFT auctions. It comes as “play-to-earn” video games like ""Axie Infinity"" surge in popularity and decentralized projects experiment with ways to get people coming back for more.      For Lawson Baker, RARA’s founder, NFT auctions offer a way to build online crypto communities.      “If you watch a hot NFT auction, you’ll see crypto influencers bidding early solely for the purpose of being seen bidding,” Baker told CoinDesk.      RARA is looking to add a decentralized curation element to the NFT sector that has so far been missing from marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible and SuperRare.      “RA! tokens will be the initial tokens earned for being a high-quality curator,” Baker told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Do it well and you’ll earn more RA! tokens to have more influence tomorrow.”      The idea is then to create a landing page that takes the pulse of what’s trending in the NFT market without relying on centralized approval.      RARA’s landing page will feature an infinite scroll of current and past auctions, sorted by the number of RA! tokens that were given by fans. Baker compared the resulting product to a Rotten Tomatoes – a movie review platform that aggregates critic and audience reviews – for NFTs.      More than 40 online communities involving about 40,000 members now have access to RARA’s auction platform, including such groups as DAOrecords, MAiworld, TokenSmart and Skybravo.      Baker told CoinDesk that RARA expects to launch a protocol later this year.",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/18/like-to-earn-nft-platform-rara-looks-to-monetize-the-future-of-online-engagement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34c7e83562fc8ee4bbe8f242bed19f7f60926c39-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the concept of decentralization experienced rapid development and gradually gained wider recognition among users in recent years, decentralized derivatives trading has naturally become one of the most promising markets. So is it possible for decentralized derivatives exchanges to disrupt their centralized counterparts in the short to medium term? Here are some of my thoughts and I&apos;d like to share them with you. In the traditional financial sector, derivatives are classified into the following categories by different product forms: forwards, futures, options and swaps. Their underlying assets can be stocks, interest rates, currencies and commodities. The notional value of the overall derivatives market in 2020 is roughly $840 trillion, compared to $56 trillion for the equity market and $119 trillion for the bond market. And the size of the derivatives market is four to five times larger than that of its underlying assets. While in the crypto world, most of the derivatives transactions happen in centralized exchanges in the forms of quarterly futures, perpetual futures (also called perpetual swaps) and options.

42376420,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ATqR,1629286200,Valid Points: Ethereum 2.0 Trends Toward Decentralization,"Tomorrow, the first backward-incompatible upgrade for the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain will be activated on the Pyrmont test network. The upgrade, dubbed “Altair,” will introduce a number of code changes, including increased penalties on validator misbehavior and improved functionality for lightweight versions of Eth 2.0 software.      (More information about what to expect from Altair can be found in a previous issue of Valid Points.)    This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.    This week, in a guest post in New Frontiers, Alex Svanevik, the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, and Nansen’s Research team break down the data behind validator behavior and stake centralization on Eth 2.0 thus far. While Altair is expected to further improve network dynamics, the authors highlight metrics suggesting that security and decentralization are already trending in a positive direction.    Pulse check    The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week.    Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.    New frontiers: Toward a decentralized Ethereum 2.0    Nansen is a blockchain analytics platform tracking over 90 million labeled Ethereum wallets and accounts. The following guest post authored by Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik and his team is an excerpt from a recently published blog post breaking down the data behind Ethereum 2.0.      While centralized exchanges such as Kraken and Binance continue to command a significant share of total Ethereum 2.0 stake, they appear to be losing share to decentralized staking alternatives such as Lido Finance and Rocket Pool.      The top four staking entities (Lido, Kraken, Binance, Staked.us) on Eth 2.0 make up 36.6% of total ETH deposits. Lido is the second largest by total ETH deposited next to Kraken, managing over 750,000 ETH on Eth 2.0 from 9,000 unique Ethereum accounts.    Measuring decentralization    The Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) is a metric in traditional economics that measures market concentration and competition. It has been applied to blockchains to measure relative network decentralization. Nansen calculates HHI for Eth 2.0 by squaring the share of each source account that has staked on the network, and summing the resulting numbers.      Though it is clearly not the case that all deposit accounts are independent, the trend does indicate a gradual decrease of HHI over time. Still, it’s important to remind ourselves that centralization risks exist on every layer of the blockchain technology stack. According to data from Ethernodes, more than 21% of Ethereum nodes run on Amazon Web Services.    Profiling deposit activity    Deposit activity on Eth 2.0 is curiously irregular and does not correlate with ETH prices.      The number of daily deposits to Eth 2.0 began falling from May 5 onward, just as Ethereum was inching toward its high of $4,000. The number of deposits then rose significantly from mid-May to mid-June as the value of Ethereum almost halved.      Ethereum 2.0 represents a marked change in the security and economic model of Ethereum, with multiple ramifications including the transformation of ETH as an inherently yield-generating asset.    Validated takes  Stani Kulechov, the founder of Aave, is working to create a decentralized alternative to Twitter. BACKGROUND: Top developers like Kulechov and co-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin believe blockchain technology can be leveraged to create higher-quality social discourse.  Ether is the most popular cryptocurrency in Singapore, according to a survey published Monday. BACKGROUND: The survey of over 4,000 adults, conducted June 29–July 9, also found that 67% of respondents with personal investments have crypto in their portfolio, and two-thirds of the crypto holders increased their digital asset holdings during the coronavirus pandemic.  Aave Arc, the institutional arm of decentralized lending protocol Aave, will not offer tether (USDT) as an asset, even though it is the most utilized stablecoin on Aave. BACKGROUND: Regulatory concerns with the largest stablecoin by market capitalization have kept it from being listed on Aave’s institutional lending platform. Tether’s largest competitor, Circle, will have USDC listed as the stablecoin of choice in the new institutional lending pools.  In efforts to develop zero-knowledge (ZK) blockchain scaling technology, Polygon, a layer two network on Ethereum, is merging with the Hermez Network. BACKGROUND: Hermez will be absorbed into the Polygon ecosystem under the name Polygon Hermez. The entire Hermez project – its employees, technology and native HEZ token (which holders will be able to exchange at a rate of 3.5 MATIC:1 HEZ) – will be integrated into Polygon’s platform.  Ethereum data platform Dune Analytics raised $8 million in a Series A funding round led by Fred Wilson’s Union Square Ventures. BACKGROUND: Dune Analytics is best known for its do-it-yourself dashboarding functionality that allows anyone with a meager knowledge of blockchain metrics to easily piece together real-time data visualizations about on-chain activity and then share those creations with the world. The platform hosts at least 6,817 different user-built dashboards tracking everything from EIP 1559 burn rates to Uniswap trading pairs.

42376398,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AQ1v,1629284400,"Crypto Adoption Shifts to Emerging Markets as China, US Drop in Chainalysis Global Rankings","Crypto adoption has increased 23-fold globally over the past year with India, Pakistan, Ukraine and other emerging markets driving the surge, Chainalysis said in a report Wednesday.      In its ""2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index,"" Chainalysis found that Chinese and U.S. positions as crypto adoption leaders have been waning amid an ongoing Chinese crackdown on crypto trading and the growing role of major financial institutions in crypto markets.      The annual study underscores two major trends; namely, that crypto adoption is accelerating quickly worldwide and that its use is shifting to markets that not long ago were more moderately active on this front, while those at the previous forefront are confronting significant changes in their regulatory and financial services landscapes.      Instead of measuring crypto trading volume, which favors countries with high levels of professional and institutional adoption, Chainalysis focused on blockchain activity by non-professional and individual crypto users. This methodology encompasses crypto adoption in more ordinary activities, including savings, rather than just trading and speculation.      Based on three metrics – on-chain value received, on-chain retail value received (value under $10,000) and peer-to-peer exchange trading volume – Vietnam, India, Pakistan, the Ukraine and Kenya were the top-five ranked countries among 154 surveyed by Chainalysis.      The total of all 154 countries’ index scores for each quarter since the second quarter of 2019 has grown by more than 2,300% at the end of Q2 2021 from Q3 in 2019.      “In emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions,” the report said.      Vietnam, Kenya, Nigeria and Venezuela, the latter two of which are also ranked high on the index, have seen particularly large transaction volumes on peer-to-peer (P2P), adjusted by purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita. That trend has occurred because many people in those countries have limited access to centralized exchanges and rely heavily on P2P crypto exchanges as their on-ramp to crypto, according to Chainalysis.      “Many emerging markets represented here limit the amount of the national currency that residents can move out of the country,” the report added. “Cryptocurrency gives those residents a way to circumvent those limits so that they can meet their financial needs.”      By contrast, China and the U.S. dropped in the Chainalysis rankings. China, which ranked fourth last year, now ranks 13th, while the U.S., which was sixth last year, is now eighth on the list.      The main reason for both countries’ decline is that their rankings in P2P trade volume weighted for the internet-using population have dropped significantly. China plunged from 53rd to 155th, while the U.S. sank from 16th to 109th.      Chainalysis data showed that smaller, retail-sized payments of under $10,000 in crypto have mostly driven transactions on P2P exchanges, indicating that China and the U.S. have seen decreased retail interest in crypto trading.      But the reasons for decreased retail market participation are different in China versus the U.S.      For example, retail traders in China have faced more restrictions during the government's crypto trading crackdown. In the U.S., the crypto market has become more institutionalized, as more professional and large investors have jumped into crypto, according to Chainalysis.      Whether it is the retail market or the increased institutional presence in more developed countries, Chainalysis wrote that “skyrocketing” crypto adoption in the past 12 months tells that crypto has become a “truly global phenomenon.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/18/crypto-adoption-shifts-to-emerging-markets-as-china-us-drop-in-chainalysis-global-rankings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c756749cd85b8bd66ef75ff1917496e75d301153-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a report by the Jamaican Observer on Wednesday, the bank said that although personal information and transactions can be monitored when Jamaica's version of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is used, it would have to overcome legal hurdles to do so.      “This information is not shared with the Bank of Jamaica and any other authority due to customers' confidentiality and data protection,"" the bank said in the report. ""This information can only be shared under a court order.""      The bank said it would only capture general data for its economic analysis and assessments.      Proponents of CBDCs say the currencies would enable improved access to regulated payments for the underbanked, while providing liquidity and enhancing payment rails among retail merchants. The BOJ expects cost savings to come from its ownership of the technology involved in producing the CBDC, according to the report.      Last week, the central bank minted its first batch of CBDCs totaling $1.5 million as part of a pilot program directed toward deposit-taking institutions and authorized payment service providers.

The rebound from 24-hour lows of $44,248 follows a period of profit-taking on Tuesday on the back of short-term fatigue, as CoinDesk reported. Bitcoin is currently changing hands at around $45,000 and is down 2.9% from a 24-hour high of $47,157, CoinDesk data show.      Bitcoin continues to cool upon multiple attempts at $50,000, evoking moments of price action gone by, though that may be less of a concern now given demand from bigger players, according to some market participants.      ""In comparison to the bull runs in 2017 and 2018, the current movement takes a more mature trend,"" said Cynthia Wu, head of sales at Singapore-based digital asset services firm Matrixport. ""The market landscape has become much more institutionalized – where now you have proprietary traders in crypto hedge funds, crypto-offerings from foreign exchange brokers and institutions ... that are transacting on an institutional scale.""      The price trend for bitcoin and the fusion of retail and institutional interest are signs that the search for yield by investors, big or small, has extended into crypto and ""will be around for good,"" Wu added.      Bitcoin's daily price action remains relatively flat with the weight of the previously discussed 200-day moving average bearing down on prices near $45,500, a sign that further selling pressure could be lurking around the corner.      Meanwhile, the altcoin market continues to hold firm with most in the top 20 coins by market cap remaining in the green over the past seven days.      “Overall, the markets have seen a positive trend continue this week; altcoins are up while bitcoin has coasted flat,"" said Byron Goldberg, Australian country manager at crypto exchange Luno. ""Interestingly, we are seeing ether slightly outperform bitcoin week-on-week.""      Over a 30-day period, ether is up 67.6%, compared with bitcoin's 46.3% rise during the same period, Messari data shows.      Goldberg points to Ethereum's London hard fork as the likely catalyst for driving prices higher.      Indeed, futures premium on ether stands at 7.36%, compared with bitcoin's meagre 2.8%, meaning the crypto markets are likely anticipating ether to rise further than bitcoin over the next three months with a shift in institutional interest, Goldberg added.      All major cryptos in the top 20 posted results in the red over a 24-hour period by press time. Dogecoin shed the most, while uniswap and chainlink followed close behind.

Its net comprehensive loss for the quarter, which excludes non-controlling interests, totaled $175.8 million, compared with a profit of $35.3 million on the same basis during the same period the year before, according to a press release on Monday,.      The firm, which was co-founded by former hedge fund manager and billionaire Michael Novogratz, attributed the loss to a 34% decline in crypto prices that included a 41% decline in the price of bitcoin during the quarter.      Galaxy Digital said the drop in crypto prices was partly offset by its core operating activities, including liquidity provision and execution services, counterparty trading volume growth and the addition of blue-chip partnerships to the firm.      ""While the second quarter included significant volatility and macro-related headwinds to near-term results, our core operating activities ... delivered another quarter of rapid growth consistent with the pace of adoption of the crypto economy,"" Novogratz said.      The firm also said its trading division saw continued growth in volume with a 90% increase from the first quarter and an increase of over 560% from the second quarter of 2020.      Gross counterparty loan originations were up over 130% since March 31 to about $1.56 billion. As of July 31, Galaxy Digital reported preliminary assets under management of over $1.6 billion.

At the start of 2021, Ether was hovering around $1,000. In other words, it has tripled since then, and it&apos;ll need to triple again to reach $10,000.

That said, there are a few reasons to believe that Ether could reach $10,000 in the next five years.

Hex Trust will begin by providing an internal service for the bank's employees in a pilot run. UnionBank said it is looking to tap into the digital assets market as institutional and customer interest grows.

UnionBank, one of the island nation's top 10 banks by total assets, said it is fully compliant in its latest offering with the Philippines' central bank, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).      ""We are excited to be the first Philippine bank to pilot a custody service for digital assets for our own employees, overseen by the BSP so that we can prepare the groundwork for a safe and protected system for customers' digital assets,” Henry Aguda, the bank's chief technology and operations officer, said.      Last year, Hex Trust teamed up with enterprise blockchain company R3 to offer banking clients another option for issuing security tokens using R3's Corda software development kit. It also said it is working with one of Asia's largest banks.      Hex Trust, which has offices in Hong Kong and Singapore, said it is expanding to the European market this year.
