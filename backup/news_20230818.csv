16205729,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4629703-ripple-renewed-trajectory?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1692399763,Ripple's Renewed Trajectory,"Summary Central banks are actively using Ripple's CBDC-dedicated network for the pilot phase of their CBDC projects. XRP saw inflows of $0.5 million and has been on a 16-week inflows streak, representing 12% of assets under management (AuM). XRP's AuM has risen 127% YTD. Ripple has entered a partnership with MasterCard to help central banks explore and understand the benefits and limitations of CBDCs. Introduction Ripple ( XRP-USD ), a pioneering blockchain network, has seen its native coin XRP rise to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Investor sentiment towards Ripple has shifted since the latest ruling in the long-standing SEC-Ripple case. Following the announcement of the ruling, Ripple's native coin XRP resumed trading on certain crypto exchanges that had previously delisted XRP trading pairs because of the SEC litigation. Institutional investors, who were once hesitant to engage with investment products centered around XRP, have now shown renewed interest in this digital asset. Crypto ETP platform, CoinShares, released a recent report that highlights digital asset fund flows. The report reveals that digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling $29 million this past week. The new wave of inflows was preceded by a three-week streak of outflows totaling $144 million. Bitcoin had the highest amount of inflows, totaling $27 million. According to the report, XRP saw inflows of $0.5 million and is on a 16-week inflows streak, representing 12% of assets under management (AuM). XRP's AuM has risen 127% YTD. And the XRP ledger has witnessed an increase in the number of daily transactions, averaging 1.2 million daily transactions since the start of this month. XRP Real-World Adoption The utility of a blockchain network is directly tied to its practical applications in the real world. Ripple is focused on cross-border payments, and I think this is one of the use cases that could drive the mass adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Ripple has built a suite of products aimed at solving the problems the present cross-border payment network face. Over the years, Ripple has actively engaged in partnerships and collaborations with payment networks, banks, and government financial entities to integrate or explore the use of blockchain technology. Some of Ripple's recent partnerships and collabs include: MasterCard CBDC Partner Program: MasterCard ( NYSE:MA ) announced a new partner program which the company says is ""designed to foster collaboration with key players in the [digital asset] space so they can drive innovation and efficiencies."" Ripple is on the list of the first set of partners, which include Consensys, Fluency, Idemia, Consult Hyperion, Giesecke+Devrient, and Fireblocks. MasterCard says the partner program will explore central bank digital currency (CBDC) design, interoperability, and the advantages and limitations of CBDCs. Ripple has been the favorite blockchain network for pilot CBDC projects. In May, Ripple launched a blockchain network, powered by Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL), dedicated to the development of stablecoins and CBDCs. The launch of this CBDC platform has caught the attention of central banks and has encouraged them to explore how they can use XRPL for their own CBDC projects. In July, the Pacific Island Nation of Palau started a pilot CBDC on the Ripple network. Banco de la República, Colombia's central bank, has also tapped Ripple for its CBDC project pilot. Real Estate Asset Tokenization in Hong Kong: The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) initiated an e-HKD (its CBDC) pilot program in which Ripple is one of the 16 chosen pilot participants. Fubon Bank (another pilot participant) and Ripple are to examine the use of the e-HKD in the realm of residential mortgage loans, which make up a substantial portion of the local banking sector's loan portfolio. The project revolves around the transformation of property title deeds into blockchain-based digital tokens, ensuring a singular and reliable source of information integrated into the loan approval process. Ripple's involvement in the partnership centers on its expertise in blockchain technology, contributing to the creation of a seamless experience for potential homebuyers by enabling e-HKD loans to be accessible through both online and offline platforms within an e-wallet. I expect Ripple to forge numerous new partnerships, integrations, and MoUs in the coming months, propelled by Judge Analisa Torres' ruling affirming XRP's non-security status in the long-drawn battle with the SEC. Ripple's Role in the Future of Payment statista Central banks around the world are actively exploring the development of CBDCs. I believe that the current legacy payment rails are counting their last days and the introduction of a new global payment system is imminent. From the Bank of England to remote islands in the Caribbean, efforts to explore and create government-backed digital currencies are underway. Ripple, with its range of products, is strategically positioned to play a key role in these upcoming global payment innovations. Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), for example, which helps facilitate cross-border transfers without the need for pre-funding has been integrated by some payment providers, like the Malaysian-based cross-border payment hub Tranglo and the Japanese financial services provider SBI Remit . Beyond offering a suite of payment-focused products that gives it a footing in the trillion-dollar cross-border payment market, Ripple actively seeks to make its technology and products compliant with industry and regulatory standards. This is evident in the fact that Ripple is one of the first enterprise blockchain networks to become ISO 20022 compliant. ISO 20022 is an emerging global standard for financial information and is set to become the international standard language for cross-border payments worldwide, and will allow richer and more data to be shared among financial institutions. Global payment network SWIFT has adopted the ISO 20022 standard. Ripple , alongside Stellar Lumens ( XLM-USD ), Quant ( QNT-USD ), Algorand ( ALGO-USD ), Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR-USD ), IOTA ( IOTA-USD ), and the XDC Network are the crypto projects currently on the list of ISO 20022 complaint crypto projects. Risk Despite Ripple's promising prospects for success and prominence in cross-border payments, there are still certain risks that have the potential to impede Ripple's growth and journey toward achieving prominence. Regulation As witnessed in the long-lasting legal brawl with the SEC, regulatory constraints can severely limit the progress of Ripple. Though Ripple strives to be standard and regulatory-compliant in its product offerings, the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency means regulations can be hard to predict. New rules might come in the future that could adversely affect the operations of Ripple. Emergence of Proprietary CBDC Networks Some central banks are more interested in running their own private distributed ledger network (DLT) for their CBDCs. This poses a potential risk to Ripple's adoption, as these central banks might prioritize their systems over utilizing another for cross-border payments. This scenario could limit Ripple's market reach and slow down its efforts to establish a global standard for efficient cross-border transactions. Competing Blockchain Networks Although Ripple is highly focused on cross-border payment and has a network dedicated to the development of CBDCs, we have seen instances of central banks choosing to use other blockchain networks for their CBDC projects instead of Ripple's much-touted CBDC platform. Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, uses the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain for its CBDC project. Another scenario arises where some central banks might decide not to implement blockchain technology for its CBDC but opt for a more centralized network infrastructure or another form of DLT; for instance, the Bank of England is exploring options for its CBDC and says it might not be built on a blockchain network, and the Bank of Italy chose Algorand as the blockchain network for its digital guarantees platform. Uncertainty of Partnership Conversion Many of Ripple's heralded partnerships are based on MoUs, which are agreements that lack binding obligations. While central banks may initially pilot their CBDCs on the Ripple network, there is some possibility that they might opt not to proceed with building their official digital payment systems on Ripple after the pilot phase. This situation could potentially lead to challenges in translating successful pilots into long-term collaborations, impacting Ripple's efforts to solidify its role in the evolution of digital payments infrastructure. Conclusion In conclusion, Ripple's focus on cross-border payments shows big possibilities. Now that the long-awaited verdict of the non-security status of XRP has been delivered, this verdict creates an even more favorable playing field for Ripple to harness its expertise and gain prominence in cross-border global payment. XRP price surged following the verdict in its case with the SEC, jumping by 75% and trading for around $0.82. XRP has, however, retraced to the $0.5 range - its ""pre-verdict"" price level. I don't see any new catalysts to push up the price of XRP for now, therefore I wouldn't recommend a buy. It is, however, worth a hold for investors who have XRP in their portfolio.",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4629703-ripple-renewed-trajectory?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/16205729.jpeg
16205507,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4629702-grayscale-ethereum-trust-patience-will-be-rewarded?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1692399299,Grayscale Ethereum Trust: Patience Will Be Rewarded,"Summary Ethereum futures ETF could be approved as early as October, indicating increasing adoption of crypto in traditional finance. Grayscale's Bitcoin fund discount to NAV has decreased from 45% to 26%, while Ethereum Trust NAV discount is still at 38%. Concerns include forced sale risk and underlying asset risk, but there are positive signs for Ethereum's future. Last November I covered the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) for the second time. At the time of publishing Stop Panicking and Grab This Arb , the crypto market was very much dealing with the fallout from the collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX. Among other crypto declines, the Grayscale funds were being sold off hard and both ETHE and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) were trading at 45% discounts to the net asset value (or NAV) of the fund shares. A lot has happened in the 9 months since that article. Though we currently find ourselves in what is another deep crypto selloff, Grayscale's lawsuit against the SEC is showing promise and several other firms in traditional finance are applying for spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs. There is increasing belief that a spot BTC ETF approval is now a matter of when not if. Should that sentiment be proven correct, the next logical step forward for crypto exposure through ""TradFi"" institutions would theoretically be Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). And according to Bloomberg , we're already seeing indications that an Ethereum futures ETF could be approved by the SEC as early as October. The regulator isn’t likely to block the products, which would be based on futures contracts for the second-largest cryptocurrency, according to people familiar with the matter. Nearly a dozen companies, including Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares, have filed to launch the ETFs. It's important to mention that any impending futures ETF approval does not necessarily mean a spot ETH ETF will be approved as well. I would imagine we'd need to see a spot Bitcoin ETF first and thus I won't speculate as to when a spot ETH ETF could find its way to the US market. But I do believe the market has yet to price that possibility in to the ETHE shares. Data by YCharts The rising belief that a spot Bitcoin ETF is coming has helped move the discount to NAV in Grayscale's Bitcoin fund from 45% earlier this summer up to 26% as of article submission. We've also seen a bit of relief in the Ethereum Trust NAV discount as well over that time but at 38%, the ETHE NAV discount still has a long way to go to catch GBTC. Related Party Holdings Update We don't yet have all of the updated 10-Q filings for Grayscale's single asset funds but most of the 10-Qs for the bigger funds have been released: Related Party Share Holdings As of 12/31/22 Current 10-Q Change GBTC 36,065,470 36,069,847 0.01% ETHE 11,811,797 8,728,797 -26.10% Ethereum Classic Trust ( ETCG ) 3,258,770 3,002,894 -7.85% Litecoin Trust ( OTCQX:LTCN ) 1,296,956 1,126,498 -13.14% Bitcoin Cash Trust ( OTCQX:BCHG ) 1,786,273 1,443,441 -19.19% Source: Grayscale In the table above, I'm showing Grayscale's top five single asset funds by AUM. GBTC, ETHE, and ETCG 10-Qs are all as of Q2-23 while LTCN and BCHG are as of Q1-23. At -26%, ETHE shares have been sold to the largest degree when analyzing year to date holdings change on a percentage basis. This is certainly cause for concern but it also opens up the possibility that the worst could actually be over for ETHE related party selling. Related Party Ownership Shares Held Shares Outstanding % of Fund Owned GBTC 36,069,847 692,370,100 5.21% ETHE 8,728,797 310,158,500 2.81% ETCG 3,002,894 13,993,800 21.46% LTCN 1,126,498 17,204,700 6.55% BCHG 1,443,441 34,812,900 4.15% Source: Grayscale Furthermore, if related parties like Digital Currency Group find that asset liquidations are still necessary, those sales may not actually pressure the price of ETHE lower to the degree that other Grayscale funds could be pressured by related party sales. Related parties have an enormous position in the Ethereum Classic fund. This is also the case for some of the smaller Grayscale funds by AUM. But it is not the case for Ethereum. At just 2.8%, related parties own a relatively small percentage of ETHE shares compared to the firm's other top 5 funds. Ethereum Network Dominance The NAV discount and the related party ownership dynamics are just two of the factors to consider when looking at ETHE. The biggest reason to consider longing ETHE shares is because of the theoretical value of the network where the collateral lives and the price appreciation of that collateral. As a network, Ethereum remains the top smart contract public blockchain network in crypto. TVL Share By Chain (Ethereum in blue) (DeFi Llama) In the chart above, I'm showing the total DeFi market by blockchain share of TVL per DeFi Llama data. At $22.5 billion in TVL, Ethereum currently commands 58.9% of DeFi TVL at the base layer alone. This is actually ahead of the 49.8% share of TVL back in May of 2022. It should be noted that this May 2022 comp pre-dates the collapse of Terra Luna ( LUNC-USD ). But even after that major crypto event, Ethereum's share of TVL at the base layer was 55%. When we add the scaling/L2 chains to the picture, that's when we can really see Ethereum's dominance growth as an ecosystem over the last year or so: TVL Share 5/11/22 8/17/23 Ethereum 55.31% 58.91% Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) 3.08% 2.12% Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ) 1.39% 4.67% Optimism ( OP-USD ) - 1.93% ETH Ecosystem Subtotal 59.78% 67.63% Source: DeFi Llama As other L1 chains like Solana ( SOL-USD ), Binance ( BNB-USD ), and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), have seen share of the DeFi market decline in the last 15 months, the Ethereum ecosystem has seen share go from under 60% to nearly 68%. From where I sit, this is particularly impressive because the L1 chains that have given up share are the ones that have had lower transaction fees at the user level: 365 Day Fees (Token Terminal) In the last year, Ethereum has generated roughly $2 billion in fees. This is more than Binance Smart Chain, Tron ( TRX-USD ), and most of the other L1 chains combined. Risks There are numerous valid concerns that can be raised about longing ETHE at this time. As mentioned in a previous section, there is forced sale risk due to the amount of ETHE shares that are held by related parties. However, I believe any possible Grayscale fund share selling by DCG or related parties will impact ETHE to a lesser degree than other funds. Much of that selling has likely happened already for ETHE judging by the updated related party holdings from the early-August 10-Q filings. But ETHE shares also carry underlying asset risk. If the price of ETH goes down, it's a safe bet that ETHE will decline as well. And there's always the possibility that ETHE shares could again trade at a lower NAV discount than current levels even if ETH is flat. Finally, with the exception of playing the NAV arb, longing ETHE might ultimately be unattractive because of the in-kind yields that can be generated by staking Ethereum either directly or through a service provider. The ETH collateral held in custody for ETHE shares isn't actively staked. This means there is an opportunity cost associated with going long ETHE rather than staking ETH directly. Summary Despite the latest drawdown in Ethereum and the crypto market more broadly, there are a lot of positive signs for the crypto industry. We've seen several recent indications that traditional financial firms are more comfortable entering the space. While you won't get much of an argument from me on the saturation and proliferation of layer 1 smart contract blockchains that have entered the market in recent years, Ethereum is still the leader by several important activity metrics like TVL and network fees. With the important caveat that crypto is designed to be self-custodied and I consider myself a major proponent of both self-custodial solutions and on-chain activity, if one wants to speculate on the potential upside of ETH as a digital asset, I think ETHE shares offer a really attractive way to do so. Not only can the shares be purchased in tax-advantaged accounts, but they're still trading at a considerable discount to net asset value. I believe we're getting close to an ETH futures ETF. It isn't illogical to assume Grayscale might prioritize ETF conversion for more of its crypto products if its lawsuit with the SEC is successful. I believe ETHE would be next in line. Patience will be rewarded in my opinion.",POSITIVE,BCH | ETC,BCH | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4629702-grayscale-ethereum-trust-patience-will-be-rewarded?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/16205507.jpeg

16204806,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548000,1692397841,"Bitcoin Bulls Beware: Sub $20,000 Nightmare Looms, Analyst Foresees Extended Downturn","In a shocking twist, Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, has plunged to levels not seen since the early days of 2023. The battle-hardened Bitcoin bulls have suffered another crushing defeat, leaving investors on edge, anxiously pondering whether the dreaded sub $20,000 abyss will haunt them again. With relentless uncertainty gripping the market, the burning question lingers: Has Bitcoin truly hit rock bottom, or is BTC in for an even darker descent? Bitcoin Path Aligned With 1930 Stock Market Crash According to Mike McGlone, Bloomberg’s Senior Macro Strategist, Bitcoin’s current trajectory bears an uncanny resemblance to the US stock market crash of 1930. In his analysis, McGlone highlights the clear rollover pattern and downward trend evident in Bitcoin’s 100-week moving average (MA) graphic. The implications of this pattern, combined with the fundamental principle of “not going against” the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the potential for reversion of one of history’s best-performing assets, warrant serious consideration. Related Reading: Valkyrie Taps Into Ethereum Momentum With New ETF Filing Adding to the potential headwinds for Bitcoin, US Treasury two-year notes yield nearly 5%, marking a historic high in the crypto realm. Bitcoin, born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and during a period of highly low-interest rates, may now be facing an extended period of retracement. According to Mcglone, in an era of near-zero and negative interest rates, the allure of a digital equivalent to gold can be captivating. However, the landscape is shifting as the world’s safest securities offer approximately 10% total return over two years. This shift may pressure the prices of riskier assets, including Bitcoin. The significance of the US Treasury two-year note’s approximate 5% yield has historical parallels. It harkens back to before the financial crisis and the birth of Bitcoin. This correlation suggests potential headwinds for most risk assets. McGlone’s analysis, focusing on the 100-week moving averages, reinforces the prevailing downward biases observed in Bitcoin, particularly when compared to the steepest Treasury yield competition witnessed in almost two decades. Analyst Warns Of Potential Sub-$20,000 Levels Bitcoin’s recent price trajectory has left many investors uncertain about its future, with some analysts drawing parallels to historical price crashes. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan has shared insights on the current market conditions. Since the beginning of the bear market, Alan has been closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price movements and sharing a chart that suggests the potential for retesting sub-$20,000 levels. While acknowledging the possibility of short-term scalping opportunities, Alan advises caution and limited exposure to preserve capital for what he believes could be a generational buying opportunity. Notably, Alan emphasizes that he does not believe the bottom has been reached for Bitcoin. The chart highlights various downrange levels, showcasing Alan’s belief in the potential for further downside movement. As depicted in Alan’s chart, the Bitcoin market faces a critical juncture where the strength of support at $25,000 is crucial for the bullish case in the near term. Failure to hold this level could lead to a revisit of the December 2017 bull market peak at $19,800. Adding to concerns for Bitcoin, there is the possibility of continuing the downside momentum, potentially reaching a four-year low around the June 2019 bull market top of $13,800. This scenario would catch many bulls off guard, especially considering the prevailing belief throughout 2023 that the crypto winter was ending.

42409912,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQUKo,1692393204,"XRP Ruling Needs Appeals Court Review, SEC Says","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked for permission on Friday to appeal a federal judge's ruling that XRP sales through exchanges didn't violate securities law, a day after the judge said the SEC could present its argument.  The SEC petitioned Judge Analisa Torres, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, to certify for an interlocutory appeal (meaning an appeal filed before the overall case is concluded) a day after she allowed the request to be made. The federal regulator is specifically appealing the judge's ruling that Ripple's programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities law because retail investors purchasing the asset on an exchange would not have the same expectations as an institutional investor purchasing XRP directly from Ripple.  ""The rulings that the SEC seeks to appeal were legal determinations about the existence of investment contracts based on undisputed facts. The undisputed facts (e.g., Order at 23 (Programmatic Sales are 'blind bid/ask transactions')) present a legal question – can an issuer’s offers and sales on crypto asset trading platforms create a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others? This legal question is at issue in a number of pending cases, and a Second Circuit ruling will have 'precedential value,'"" the filing said.  The ruling could impact other SEC cases, the regulator said, pointing to its suits against Coinbase and Dragonchain, as well as other legal matters like bankruptcies.  In its filing, the SEC noted that its argument focused on the sales of XRP, rather than the asset itself.  ""The SEC did not argue here or in Terraform that the asset underlying those investment contracts were necessarily a security (and the SEC does not seek appellate review of any holding relating to the fact that the underlying assets here are nothing but computer code with no inherent value),"" the filing said.  Ripple has until Sept. 1, 2023 to file a response to the SEC's motion. The regulator will have another week to reply to the response after that. Should the SEC win Judge Torres' approval for interlocutory appeal, it will need to petition the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to take up the case.

According to data from CoinGecko, yesterday, the asset’s value plummeted to a historical bottom, and it’s currently down by nearly 10% in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Algorand Delivers Lightning-Fast Transaction Finality With Major Protocol Upgrade Algorand Records New Low Just yesterday, amid the significant downturn in the crypto market, Algorand’s price fell below notable support. The asset dropped to a price of $0.0905 despite maintaining its stability and striving to hold its ground above the $0.11 mark over the past week. This price move resulted in more than $50 million being wiped away from the asset’s market capitalization in the past day. Algorand’s market cap stands at a valuation of $755 million, a 7.1% drop from its earlier record of $808 million on Thursday. Despite the bloodbath the asset’s market cap and price currently suffer, its trading volume has moved in the opposite direction. ALGO’s trading volume has surged from a low of $46.5 million yesterday to as high as sitting above $73 million at the time of writing. This isn’t surprising as it indicates a potential violent sell-off. Furthermore, it is worth noting that before ALGO’s current bloodbath, the US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman once recognized Algorand as a “great technology.” At least on Algorand, I agree with Gary. Gensler is bullish on Algorand!😅 pic.twitter.com/BnKkU8d8gS — Mr. Huber🔥🦅🔥 (@Leerzeit) November 14, 2021 However, despite receiving positive reviews, even from the SEC, the asset eventually became entangled in legal disputes, leading to its inability to maintain stability and ultimately hitting a historic low. Legal Complications Taking A Toll? Besides ALGO’s price action, the last few months have been tumultuous for Algorand. Two lawsuits have cast long shadows over its progress. In its suit against the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex in April, the SEC hinted that ALGO is a security under US laws. This classification opened Pandora’s box of regulatory challenges for Algorand, impacting its perception among investors. Further complicating matters for Algorand was another SEC lawsuit aimed at the behemoth crypto exchange, Binance, in June 2023. This litigation mentioned ALGO, exacerbating its woes and dragging it to its recent historically low prices. Related Reading: Algorand (ALGO) Price Turns Positive, Bulls Eyeing Further Gains?

42409922,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQUhx,1692391892,El Salvador Diary: Lightning Is Key to Bitcoin Adoption,"This week, as I travel around El Salvador, I met with two people who are actively working to help increase the speed of Bitcoin adoption and to help foreign investors start Bitcoin-related businesses.  The current market price of Bitcoin, approximately $29,500, puts the prospect of owning a full bitcoin outside of the reach of most people. However, each bitcoin is subdivisible into one hundred million sub-units called “satoshis,” allowing anyone to exchange fiat-to-bitcoin in smaller amounts. Bitcoin investors refer to investing in smaller increments as “stacking sats.” This, paired with Layer Two (L2) integrations like the Lightning Network, are seen by many as the pathway to increasing Bitcoin use cases and elevating its role as a medium of exchange in commerce.  Jonathan Martin is a graduate of Stanford University, Georgetown University, and a student at The Wharton School, currently on leave immersing himself in the world of Bitcoin in El Salvador. His first diary entry is here.  I met with a Salvadoran entrepreneur named Edgar Borja for lunch, the founder of a company called K1, to learn about what he is building. Borja invented a Lightning-enabled ATM that massively reduces the frictional costs associated with the fiat-to-bitcoin conversions compared to other Bitcoin on-ramps that utilize the Layer One (L1) blockchain.  Shortly after sitting down for lunch, Borja pulled out a small metal box from his backpack with an LCD touch screen and placed it on the table. He plugged it into the wall and booted it up while explaining the technology it utilizes. The version of the device that he brought only accepted coins and looked like a mini slot machine. He said that K1 sells another version of the device that accepts fiat dollar bills.  Borja deposited 5 cents into the coin slot, tapped once or twice on the LCD screen, and directed me to hold up the QR code for my Lightning-enabled wallet (called Wallet of Satoshi) on my iPhone to the embedded camera. Within seconds, the equivalent of 5 cents in Satoshis arrived in my wallet. There was no fee associated with the transaction.  Read more: What Is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?  The Lightning Network allows for near-instantaneous transactions, serving as a “bar tab” where people can exchange funds without using the slower underlying L1 Bitcoin Network until final settlement. This dramatic increase in speed and reduction in transaction fees makes bitcoin less cumbersome and more fluid, potentially making it more palatable as a medium of exchange for the average user.  K1 sells its Lightning ATMs for $1,200 and does not charge any recurring fees thereafter. Business owners are free to include a usage fee of their choosing once they own the device. K1 ATMs lower the barrier to entry for the fiat-to-bitcoin conversion and could potentially address a much larger market than the Athena ATMs that utilize the L1 blockchain and have much higher fees.  K1 has sold machines to businesses in 11 countries, including El Salvador, and Borja has one of the clearest roadmaps to spurring the mass adoption I’ve come across.  Bitcoin for big business  Prior to arriving in El Salvador, I contacted an attorney named Carlos Miguel Rivas Carrillo, Board Secretary of the El Salvador Bitcoin Association (ASOBITCOIN), to get a sense of the process to start a business here. The government is actively trying to attract American entrepreneurs and investors, and has created a very business-friendly climate. ASOBITCOIN works closely with the government-sanctioned Bitcoin office, and helps investors get their projects approved by the relevant authorities.  Rivas was extremely knowledgeable about the local Salvadoran laws and regulations and even offered to help me incorporate a business. The process takes three to four days with the help of attorneys that cost $1,500-$2,000. There is also a government fee of $300, and the minimum investment capital requirement is $2,000.  He told me that Salvadoran banks are not yet Bitcoin-friendly because they still integrate with legacy systems like SWIFT. To use bitcoin for commercial transactions, non-bank services will take the digital commodity and issue a cashier’s check that can be deposited in a normal bank account. I left the meeting with a much firmer understanding of how to start a business in El Salvador as a foreign national.  My work experience is mostly as an entrepreneur, and I started two successful real estate companies in Austin, T.X. before attending The Wharton School. I came to El Salvador with the intention to identify gaps in the nascent Bitcoin economy, including the potential for Bitcoin applications in real estate and/or coffee farming. Things that we take for granted in the U.S., like the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) with all the currently listed properties and recent tractions, do not exist here yet. Similarly, the chain of title on a property is opaque; the centralized records are sometimes wrong; and suing someone who has a lien or a claim on a property can delay the investment process by as much as a year.  Several people, including Rivas, have said how the blockchain could be used to address the existing problems and eliminate some of the existing inefficiencies in the economy. These inefficiencies potentially create large opportunities for intrepid entrepreneurs.  Bitcoin for commerce  Everywhere I go, I try to purchase items using bitcoin first – either with my Coinbase wallet or my Wallet of Satoshi. I went grocery shopping at the supermarket in my neighborhood and tried to pay with bitcoin at check-out. The cashier initially stated the store accepts bitcoin, and she busily started pressing buttons on her computer that appeared to be five-plus years old. However, the bitcoin point of sale component of the system was not working. So, I had to pay with cash.  When I explored Presidente Plaza, one of the newest malls in the country that is not yet fully built, I tried to use my Wallet of Satoshi several times. The coffee shop did not have a functioning bitcoin PoS system, nor did the comic shop that I entered. I ended up paying using a credit card both times, and the vendors utilized hand-held BAC Credomatic scanners. These are very common in San Salvador and have the option for credit or debit. It was not immediately clear to me whether the vendors even owned bitcoin PoS devices.  For bitcoin to be used more readily as a medium of exchange, these devices would likely need to add a third integration — Lightning — to make using bitcoin more intuitive and straightforward for vendors. The barriers to mass adoption exist on both sides of commercial transactions.  After more than a week in El Salvador, I can see evidence of the infrastructure outlined in President Bukele’s Bitcoin vision. The price volatility inherent to bitcoin scares some people away, but this ignores the volatility that inflation introduces to the use of fiat. My best estimate is that it will be several years before everyday people trust the Bitcoin network the same as they trust dollars.  One thing is for certain: people like Borja and Rivas will be critical in achieving Bukele’s goal.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Jonathan Martin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/18/el-salvador-diary-lightning-is-key-to-bitcoin-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04ab6027a7c37f932ee3ba2c0d7d217e5c9b6a45-3018x2302.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16200542,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547982,1692388856,XRP Pain May Not Be Over Following This Decision In The Ripple Vs SEC Case,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reopened old wounds after a federal Judge grants the regulator’s request to file a new appeal against Ripple. Ripple And SEC Legal Battle Continues Ripple, the crypto firm behind XRP cryptocurrency, had secured a partial victory in July in its case against the SEC that had raged on for almost three years. However, the regulator has not taken this lying down as on Thursday, August 17, Judge Analisa Torres reportedly gave official approval to the SEC’s motion to file an interlocutory appeal against XRP cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout According to the court proceedings, the SEC will file its motion in court from Friday, August 18 until Friday, September 1. This gives the regulator the opportunity and ample time to develop and provide a compelling argument for its allegations of XRP being a security. This is because the appeal will be focused on the judge’s decision on Ripple’s programmatic sales and direct sales and offerings of XRP tokens as a trade for goods and services. The new filing is not an official approval of an appeal by the judge but a gateway for the SEC to file its motion. But regardless, this new development could be bad for Ripple who recently celebrated Judge Torres’ declaration that secondary sales of XRP did not count as a security. Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Garlinghouse, and Chief Learning Officer, Stuart Alderoty have addressed the SEC’s decision to put forward an appeal motion. They publicly opposed the SEC’s interlocutory appeal, detailing that the Judge’s ruling on July 13 refutes any allegations the SEC may harbor of XRP being a security. “We oppose the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal. There is no extraordinary circumstance here that would justify departing from the rule requiring all issues as to all parties to be resolved before an appeal,” Alderoty stated in a Twitter post. On his part, CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented: Reminder – the request for appeal (even if granted) doesn’t change the fact that XRP is not a security. That’s not up for debate/trial. But the SEC continues to claim that Chris and I acted recklessly in believing that XRP is not a security. That’s utter nonsense. XRP price dumps alongside crypto market | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com SEC Regulator Criticizes Judge Ruling The SEC’s move to file an interlocutory motion does not come as a surprise as the regulatory body has previously made complaints about the proceedings of Judge Torres’s ruling in the XRP case. The regulator made criticisms of the case’s outcome by questioning the ruling’s alignment with legal principles and stating that the verdict was “wrongly decided.” Related Reading: Post-Hack Shenanigans: Curve (CRV) To Launch On TRON Following $2 Million Investment The regulator has also been adamant about an interlocutory review and has stated that the case requires a higher review and better clarification by higher judicial authorities, to ensure legal proceedings are executed according to established laws and legal principles. “Interlocutory review is warranted here. These two issues involve controlling questions of law on which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion, as reflected by an intra-district split that has already developed,” the SEC said in its new filing.

42409907,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQUAt,1692388416,Tokenization News Roundup: Consolidation Coming,"The idea of tokenizing real-world assets – everything from homes, gold, art and collectibles to instruments like U.S. Treasuries and contracts – is gaining pace. Each week, we’ll be rounding up the most important news, offering you a snapshot of developments in this burgeoning space. (For an explainer on real-world assets, please see our article here.)  Securitize Agrees to Buy Crypto Wealth Manager Onramp to Expand RIA Services – CoinDesk  The crypto incumbent has a strong balance sheet and is on the market for more acquisitions, CEO Carlos Domingo said.  The Story: Asset tokenization firm Securitize has acquired digital asset wealth platform Onramp Invest, which will enable a whole new cohort of registered investment advisors (RIAs) to help clients buy tokenized assets. The firm specializes in alternative assets classes such as private equity, private credit, secondaries and real estate. ""Onramp already offered RIAs easy access to digital assets, so it is a very natural extension to offer them tokenized alternative assets to complement their portfolios,” Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said in a statement.  The Takeaway: While much of the discussion around tokenization is framed around expanding access to alternative assets, the deal, which is set to close in the coming days, may indicate that a wave of consolidations may be coming. It’s possible firms focused on real world assets haven’t been hit as hard by rising inflation or the crypto market pullback, and could see an opportunity as venture capital funding has dried up and startup valuations have decreased. Domingo, who is looking for more dealflow, described this as a way “to accelerate the digitization of finance.”  Goldfinch Writes Down Failed $5M Loan To Kenyan Taxi Financier – DL News  A Kenya-based company defaulted on a DeFi loan after breaking the terms of service. Is the top crypto-powered microloan platform underpricing its risk?  The Story: Goldfinch, one of the most successful DeFi investment protocols extending credit to developing countries, has become something of a cautionary tale after a borrower in East Africa defaulted on a $5 million loan. Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, has accused its borrower – a Kenya-based motorbike finance company called Tugende – of making an unauthorized loan to a subsidiary in Uganda in violation of the loan agreement.  Warbler is now working to rewrite the terms of the liquidated loan in hopes it can earn back some capital — a rare example of a loan restructuring in DeFi and a first for Goldfinch. If the loan must be written off entirely, people who provided liquidity to Goldfinch are expected to see their expected payouts drop to 2% from around 8%. Goldfinch has about $100 million in active loans, primarily extended to small businesses in Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia.  The Takeaway: Loan experts told DL News that Goldfinch’s loans are probably underpriced relative to the risk involved investing in firms in emerging markets. Was the writing on the wall or impossible to foresee? Tugende Kenya initially borrowed $5 million worth of USDC to finance expansion plans in 2021, and was due to finish its repayments in October 2023. It wrote on the Goldfinch governance forum that rising costs due to inflation and the war in Ukraine have limited its cash flows.  Frax Founder Proposes Expansion Into Real-World Assets – The Defiant  The Story: Frax stablecoin founder Sam Kazemian proposed using a U.S. shell company as a conduit for the algorithmic stablecoin startup to custody cash deposits, reverse repo contracts, Treasury bills and other traditional financial instruments backing FRAX. The plans are part of the project’s wider “real world asset strategy.” The entity, which would be called FinresPBC and domiciled in Delaware as a non-profit C corporation, would “provide the Frax Protocol access to safe cash-equivalent assets and near-Fed rate yields for the benefit of all without seeking to profit from this relationship or charge fees.” FRAX is the sixth-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization over $800 million.  The Takeaway: In his proposal, Kazemian wrote the company’s “sole public benefit mission is to give on-chain users access to offchain ‘cash-equivalent RWAs.’” This could be a way to differentiate FRAX from competitor stablecoins but would also have knock on effects for efficiency. Currently, Kazemian said, keeping the stablecoin stable requires frequent redemptions of “real-world fiat” and Treasuries. Although the proposal must still be voted in, Kazemian did hint at a relationship between Kansas-based Lead Bank for the effort — which shows either way the growing interconnections between DeFi and the real world.  Maker’s 8% Stablecoin Yields Re-spark DeFi – IntoTheBlock  The third-largest DeFi protocol is acting a bit more like a bank.  The Takeaway: MakerDAO, the Ethereum-based decentralized stablecoin issuer, attracted nearly $1 billion in investments in less than a week after a plan to increase the DAI Savings Rate to 8%. Like many of Maker’s recent plans, this idea was not without controversy as the increased yield payouts would be funded by Maker’s revenues, which at this point comprise a lot of real world assets including U.S. Treasuries. IntoTheBlock’s Lucas Outumuro notes that the customer acquisition strategy isn’t all that different from a bank increasing interest on savings accounts  Republic’s New Multi-Chain Wallet Is Tailored for Tokenized Assets – Blockworks  This self-custodial, multi-chain and multi-signature wallet is being built specifically with tokenized securities in mind.  The Takeaway: It shouldn’t be a surprise that Republic, a retail investment platform that allows anyone to invest in startups, crypto, real estate and other asset classes, is thinking about the future of digital ownership. The company’s first purpose-built wallet that will serve as “one unified interface” for its crypto unit was built to accommodate the next wave of tokenized assets.  It could be a smart business play for Republic, which noted how blockchains can increase access and opportunities to invest in assets that are usually off limits to most people. “For millions of global retail investors, investing in private assets like startups, real estate, and fine art is opaque, highly illiquid, and mostly inaccessible,” Andrew Durgee said in a statement. “Tokenization solves all of these problems. It’s why we built Republic Wallet.”  Gitcoin’s Collaboration With Shell Angers Crypto Community – The Defiant  The oil giant will contribute to climate rounds for the next year.  Gitcoin, a crypto-powered platform that blends crowdfunding and open-source software funding, announced it will collaborate with the multinational gas and oil conglomerate Shell PLC “to develop open-source climate solutions” over the next four quarters. “We’re excited to announce this collaboration with Shell as another key example of the real-life potential to scale transparent funding allocation via blockchain technology for real-world solutions,” Gitcoin head of impact Azeem Khan said in a statement.  Shell will donate as much as $500,000 to Gitcoin fundraising rounds that help bootstrap startups and crypto projects focused on building digital public goods and/or use crypto to build solutions in the real world. The oil giant will also contribute to a hackathon geared towards using blockchain for energy-related issues in the coming months.

42409908,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQU7a,1692386951,"Curve Crisis Averted, NFT Loans Protocol Now Votes on Next Steps","The NFT-backed loans protocol that lost nearly $12 million in crypto during the recent Curve exploit (and then paid a $1 million bounty to get most back) now has to decide how to fill the hole.  JPEG’d is a NFT-collateralized crypto lending app that issues customers a derivative of ETH, called pETH, that’s tied to their loans. Hungry to earn extra interest, many of those customers parked their pETH in a protocol-endorsed liquidity pool on Curve, the popular trading protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.  Their yield bet went bad when in early August exploiter drained that pool and others. But JPEG’d agreed to pay the exploiter a 611 ETH bounty to get 5,495 ETH (90%) back. The move saved the protocol from financial uncertainty and its customers from complete decimation on their positions.  But someone has to eat the missing 611 ETH. In a vote running until Saturday, investors governing the JPEG’d DAO are choosing between six proposals that each place that burden on a slightly different party. The option that’s overwhelmingly in the lead splits the pain between non-paying customers of JPEG’d and the DAO itself.  Called option D, it would see pETH price speculators and yield farmers who did not deposit into Curve via JPEG’d in-house service, called Citadel, get most of their money back, but not all. That’s in contrast to paying customers: pETH minters who paid a small fee to earn interest in a Curve pool through Citadel. They get made entirely whole.  The DAO will incur a net loss of 484 ETH (about $802,000) and 861 million JPEG tokens (about $450,000) under this plan. It also plans to replace pETH with a new derivative token that it will airdrop to all holders, but that will happen no matter what option wins.  A pseudonymous user experience, or UX, developer for JPEG’d who goes by the screen name 0xtutti said option D is an “in-between” solution to the sticky problem. But “everyone gets a share of the recovered assets” no matter which option wins out.  “Generally the community cared about protecting paying customers as much as possible,” 0xtutti said.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | ZRX | AIRDROP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/18/curve-crisis-averted-nft-loans-protocol-now-votes-on-next-steps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7e2d3e45cb4f32833a269e63050f1f0b8402b84-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16198791,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547942,1692385243,"More Blood Ahead? Why Bitcoin Could Crash Further If It Loses $26,000","The Bitcoin price range has been obliterated as the crypto market was corrected into a final support line. Volatility in the sector was compressed for weeks, and many were expecting some action in the short term, but the drop caught market participants by surprise as BTC kept on pushing lower. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $26,400, with an 8% loss in the last 24 hours. BTC recorded a 10% correction in the previous seven days, while some altcoins experienced a 17% and even 20% loss on BTC’s crash. Bitcoin Ready To Re-Test Support, Your Longs Could Be In Danger Bitcoin’s sudden crash into critical support around $25,000 saw over $1 billion in long liquidations. The number of traders waiting for a breakout at $30,000 provided the downside with a lot of liquidity, as NewsBTC reported yesterday. Therefore, the selling pressure was exacerbated as BTC kept on dropping. The recent crash was worse than the one experienced when crypto exchange FTX collapsed, and the crypto sector nuked all long positions by collapsing below $30,000. Similar to that occasion, the Bitcoin price took some time to recover. According to Material Indicators and its analyst Keith Alan, the same could happen in the current market conditions. Via his official X account, Alan stated that the BTC price bottom it’s not in. The chart below shows that the analyst pointed out some key levels to watch while the number one cryptocurrency by market caps hovers at $26,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidations Top $500 Million Amid $1 Billion Crypto Decimation As the chart shows, the levels pointed out by Alan include the 2017 bull market top at $20,000, the 2019 bull market top at around $14,000, and even the COVID-19 lows at $3,850. The analyst stated the following regarding BTC’s potential for further losses: (…) I can build an argument for every downrange level shown. I personally think there is a high probability of retesting sub $20k levels. That doesn’t mean that there won’t be opportunities to scalp longs along the way because whales still want to distribute as high as they can.

42409923,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQUee,1692384643,Bitcoin Plunged 11% in Worst Week Since FTX’s Collapse. What’s Next for BTC’s Price?,"BTC’s fall below $26,000 is poised to be the worst weekly decline since the collapse of FTX.  Absence of a decision in the closely followed Grayscale vs. SEC lawsuit didn’t support the recovery.  Market observers are divided on whether the correction is over.  Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to endure its worst weekly decline since the FTX crash last November following the crypto market mayhem seen Thursday, and optimistics’ hopes were dashed when a pivotal decision in the court battled between Grayscale and U.S. regulators – which could support BTC’s price – failed to materialize Friday.  BTC’s price slipped below $26,000 Friday afternoon after a rally toward $27,000 – which erased some of Thursday’s sharp decline – fizzled. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had plummeted to $25,392 Thursday afternoon, hitting its lowest price since mid-June, amid cascading liquidations of leveraged trading positions.  The price action puts the flagship crypto’s decline at roughly 11% this week, on track for the worst weekly return since November’s market crash to $15,000 that was induced by the failure of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.  Ether (ETH), XRP, MATIC, DOGE and SHIB’s prices sink, too  Ether (ETH) dropped some 10% during the week, holding up slightly better than BTC due to news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is willing to approve exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that hold ETH futures. The second-largest crypto, however, entered into “significant downtrend” for the first time in two months, according to CoinDesk’s trend indicator, suggesting strong momentum to the downside.  Ripple’s XRP, Polygon’s MATIC and popular dog-themed memecoins DOGE and SHIB suffered 15% to 20% losses this week.  The CoinDesk Market Index, proxy for the broader crypto market performance, fell more than 12% during the week.  No decision yet on Grayscale’s bitcoin trust  Market observers had been focused on 11 a.m. ET (15:00 UTC) Friday, when there was reason to believe there could be a court decision in the legal feud between investment manager Grayscale and the SEC. But the time came and went with nothing announced.  Grayscale – a subsidiary of DCG, which also owns CoinDesk – wants to convert its $12 billion GBTC bitcoin trust into an ETF – which could dramatically improve its appeal to investors – but the regulator rejected it. Grayscale sued to overturn the decision.  The verdict “looms large” over the market, Rachel Lin, CEO and co-founder of derivatives decentralized exchange SynFutures, said in an email.  “A favorable outcome might provide a substantial tailwind for BTC,” she explained. “Although an adverse ruling wouldn't inherently spell doom for BTC, it might accentuate prevailing bearish sentiments.”  In the absence of any decision, bitcoin’s price dipped below $26,000 after trading above that price for most of the day.  Short squeeze or another leg down?  Some observers tied Thursday's decline to news events such as macroeconomic gloom, but the drop can be explained by excessive leverage, crypto market analytics firm K33 Research wrote in a report.  “The sudden drop in crypto prices was driven by market structure rather than news,” K33 said. “While many have tried to hang the sharp drop on different news, ranging from news of SpaceX (Tesla) selling BTC or increased expectations of interest rate hikes in the U.S., none of these can explain the timing or the sharpness of the drop.”  “However, the build-up of leverage – open interest in the derivatives market – created the perfect conditions for rapid feedback loops, as evidenced by the sizable amount of liquidations and subsequent drop in open interest,” K33 added.  Read more: No, Elon Musk's SpaceX Isn't the Cause of This Multi-Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Bloodbath  The flush out might actually be positive for BTC’s prospects, the report argued. “There is no reason this drop should lead to a continued negative trend. If anything, the wipeout of longs and increased shorting may lay the foundations for an upcoming short squeeze.”  QCP Capital differs, expecting another leg down to near $24,000 around the end of September.  “We believe that a lot now rests on [U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome] Powell's speech at Jackson Hole next week, but having held the very key 24-25k zone on this move, our wave count calls for an end to the corrective Wave A here, a bounce in Wave B to retest the bottom of the wedge,” the firm explained in a market update sent via Telegram. “This ends off with the final Wave to end the quarter.”  Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at AltTab Capital, said in an email that the recent dip offers investors a chance to add to their stash if they have a longer time horizon.  “Despite this drop, we still saw new inflows over the past week as long-term investors, like ourselves, saw discounted prices as an opportunity to accumulate more bitcoin,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/18/bitcoin-btc-eth-xrp-matic-doge-shib-price-news,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3eceb2646e8dc60d030ee15102c4f2095ab03a3d-2598x1460.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company recently laid off some of the finest reporters and editors covering crypto, which sucks. No one here is happy.  Could things be worse? It’s hard to imagine. But at least we’re not as low as Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of FTX, who was recently thrown in one of the worst penitentiaries in the U.S. after abusing the conditions of his bail.  If there is a silver lining of the former media darling doing the unbearably petty thing of leaking his former girlfriend and colleague Caroline Ellison’s diary, it’s learning the pill-popping, salt-licking former billionaire is a bundle of anxiety.  Part of Ellison’s testimony in the trial slated to begin this October could be her running list “Things Sam is Freaking Out About” which apparently included money trouble and bad press. Oh, Sam, if only you knew the hole you were digging.  See also: The Faulty Moral Universe of Sam Bankman-Fried | Opinion  In a nod to Ellison and SBF, CoinDesk decided to memorialize some of things we’re freaking out about.

Over the past decade, Bitcoin has transformed from an obscure digital token into an economic powerhouse, drawing attention from retail investors to global financial institutions. However, as recently observed over the past 24 hours, the asset’s resistance is being tested as a report from Santiment reveals chances of it plunging below the critical $26,000 mark. Whale Activity Driving Bitcoin Price Movement Whale activity, or large-scale investors, has historically played a pivotal role in determining the direction of any crypto asset, and currently, Bitcoin is not an exception. Blockchain intelligence firm, Santiment, recently shed light on this phenomenon via a post on X (formerly known as Twitter). Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculators Retreat As Long-Term Holders Double Down Since $69,000 Peak According to the firm, the rapid price decline of Bitcoin might have been influenced by heightened whale transaction activity. And despite the substantial loss BTC has suffered in value over the past day, Santiment noted “the dust has far from settled.” This statement in an actual sense means Bitcoin’s price decline might just be starting, as according to Santiment, “whales are very active on this dump” and “the amount of large wallets is not falling.” The Blockchain intelligence firm further revealed that the surge in large transactions had commenced even before the significant market drop, hinting at the possibility of a sustained price drop. 🐳 The dust has far from settled after #crypto markets had one of its sharpest price drops of 2023.

Moreover, from a technical perspective, such a price move may not actually be far from happening. Looking at Bitcoin’s chart on the 1-day timeframe, the asset has a two-way movement of taking out liquidity which is the upside and downside. However, the likelihood of tapping into the downside liquidity appears more convincing. Given the current market trajectory, which leans bearish, each significant price movement typically correlates with liquidation efforts. As the market currently trends downwards, the most immediate liquidity target seems to be the wick beneath the $26,000 zone.

The wick represents the highest and lowest prices of an asset during a specific time frame, while the main body of the candlestick indicates the opening and closing prices As for its current price, Bitcoin is changing hands at $26,468 at the time of writing, down by nearly 10% over the past 24 hours. The asset has made significant movement in the past day recording a 24-hour high of $28,507 and a 24-low of $25,649.

On Monday, CoinDesk made the necessary but extremely difficult decision to let go of 24 colleagues — the bulk of them from our editorial operations — to reduce costs in the face of a brutally challenging market for crypto media revenue. Every one of those people was a vital contributor to the high standards of journalism that have made CoinDesk a household name in the world of crypto.  They helped us win awards — a Polk award, a New York Press Club award and, just this week, a finalist listing for this year’s Loeb awards. They contributed to the best “play for each other” spirit I’ve ever encountered in a newsroom. They made working at CoinDesk exciting and rewarding. They are all, already, sorely missed. I wish them all the very best and hope that one day I have the pleasure of working with some or all of them again.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Also, another downer: This will be the last Money Reimagined for 2023. I’m putting the newsletter on hiatus to free up time to write a book – more details on that later – and to address the challenge of thinner staffing resources at CoinDesk. It will resume publication in January.  My weekly Money Reimagined podcast, with Sheila Warren, will continue, however. This week, we feature a conversation with Frank McCourt, the construction magnate, philanthropist and founder of Project Liberty, an initiative aimed at fixing a broken internet. Frank, who is co-authoring the book mentioned above, makes the compelling point that decentralized storage solutions will allow society to break its toxic dependence on large, data-hogging internet platforms.  And now for the main column of the week.  What now for U.S. stablecoins?  As a divided Congress readies to vote on – and quite possibly kill – a new bill that would regulate stablecoins, it’s worth reflecting on how far ahead of the U.S. other jurisdictions are in this process and what the United States’ laggard status might mean for the dollar’s place in the future of money.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore this week released a new regulatory framework for stablecoins that, among other rules, imposes minimum capital requirements on issuers. Many see the new rules creating clarity and setting the generally crypto-friendly city-state up as a hub for these increasingly popular crypto payments instruments.  Also from Singapore, but executed in Switzerland, former Singaporean parliamentarian Calvin Cheng launched stablecoins pegged to the Swiss franc and the euro, according to a press release Tuesday. His company, Anchored Coins, is incorporated in Zug and, as a licensed member of the country’s VQF self-regulatory organization, is authorized to issue the coins under regulations established by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA.  The Bermuda Monetary Authority has had a licensing system for digital asset companies since 2018. In December 2022, it issued the island territory’s first license to Jewel Bank, allowing it to issue its dollar-backed stablecoin, JUSD.  In Dubai, a set of stablecoin-issuance rules has existed since the formation of the Emirate’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in March 2022.  The Canadian Securities Administrators, an umbrella organization for Canada’s provincial securities regulators, issued guidance in February to regulated crypto exchanges demanding that any stablecoin they list meet certain standards around custodial arrangements, reserve management and audits. The decision to regulate the exchange rather than the issuers, which sets up a kind of backdoor self-regulatory organization, still leaves some questions around the applicability of securities laws. But Alex McDougall, Toronto-based CEO of QCAD-issuer Stablecorp, says the rule-setting was mostly constructive, calling it “a collaborative process, not a witch hunt.”  Finally, in New York – note: not Washington, New York – payments giant PayPal harnessed the trust charter that its partner Paxos has held from the New York Department of Financial Services since 2015 to launch what Paxos calls the first regulated stablecoin in the U.S.  U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) eviscerated PayPal for launching its coin before her colleagues in the House and Senate have had time to deliberate over a federal law. Her harsh words provoked comparisons to the backlash she and others spearheaded against Facebook’s failed stablecoin, Libra, four years ago.  Some are arguing that PayPal’s move, in angering Democrats like Waters, makes it even more likely that the House stablecoin bill, which FInancial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) successfully got through committee last month, dies in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Already, McHenry’s bill has faced opposition from the White House. But as I argued last week, PayPal is pretty safe – there’s just too much pressure now on the federal government to support such projects. Other countries making progress on regulation adds to that pressure.  Even so, the fact that so many other places are acting constructively on this issue should be cause for concern for any policymaker charged with furthering U.S. interests globally. Even though dollar stablecoins issued in the U.S. and elsewhere are by far the most sought after in the world — mostly seen in crypto users’ demand for Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT – the “American opportunity” that Castle Ventures Partner Nic Carter and others see in a global “crypto dollar surge'' won't arise until USD stablecoins are given Washington’s imprimatur.  In the meantime, other countries will use their head start in regulating this rapidly evolving technology to grab a share of this new field in ways that could undermine U.S. financial leadership. Would it matter if a Swiss-issued, euro-backed stablecoin took market share away from dollars? Maybe not so much. But what if China, which is already working with Russia and other allies on crypto solutions that bypass the dollar in foreign trade, fills the vacuum?  I suppose I shouldn’t complain too much. The world might be a much better place if the U.S. squanders this opportunity to turn open-access protocols and the natural demand for dollars into a new form of domination.  But the flip side is that if, as expected, the legislative process in the U.S. drags on for a lot longer, it will perpetuate the existing system of Washington-regulated, Wall Street-managed surveillance. That’s a system that puts bank compliance officers and many other types of middlemen into subtle but powerful rent-seeking positions within the global financial system, imposing trillions of dollars in unnecessary costs and often insurmountable barriers to financial access on every person on earth.

16195390,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547946,1692378059,Shibarium Launch Saga: Block Production Resumes Despite Stuck ETH,"The Shibarium didn’t get off to a flying start following its launch on August 16. However, the network aims to move past these incidents as block production resumes. Developers Restarts Network Data from Shibariumscan.io shows that the layer-2 network is up and running again. Shibarium had on August 17 paused block production following the traffic surge, which overwhelmed the blockchain upon mainnet launch. Related Reading: Shiba Inu DAO Gets Serious With New Advisory And Investment Firm Close to $1.7 million in bridged funds had reportedly gotten stuck on the Shibarium bridge, with lead developer Shytoshi Kusama confirming that the funds were irrecoverable. However, in a blog post titled “Shibarium: ALL IS WELL,” Kusama termed this FUD and stated that contrary to earlier reports, there was no bridge issue and all funds were “safu.” He stated that Shibarium experienced a “massive influx of transactions and users that happened at the same time” upon the network going live. That led to the network going offline and not due to its functionalities as earlier thought. To highlight the magnitude of the traffic surge that the network experienced, Kusama referenced data from the Web3 development platform Alchemy. Shibraium was allotted 400 Million compute units monthly, but the network experienced 160+ million compute units in just under 30 minutes. At that rate, the network could experience billions of compute units daily, putting it on par with the most active layer-2 blockchains. SHIB price drops to $0.0000856 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Plans To Scale After Shibarium Launch Lead developer Kusama admitted that the team did not expect that level of trading activity on the network. However, he noted that they were “working tirelessly” to scale the chain and increase its computing power to handle and process more transactions. He further emphasized the team’s commitment to position Shibarium as one of the major players in the DeFi world. Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya provided further updates in a subsequent blog post dated August 18. Following an investigation, the team discovered that one particular block had been loaded with several transactions, which caused it to go into “fail safe mode” to protect the funds. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout He mentioned that the team had “identified multiple possible plans of action” to scale the network and ensure it could handle any substantial traffic on the chain. Dhairya also confirmed that the bridged funds were safe and that in a show of good faith, the team has chosen to obtain a $2 million insurance cover to protect against any potential challenges that could arise from retrieving the funds upon restart of the network. SHIB’s price has recovered considerably since the launch saga. However, the token is still down about 1.78% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42409906,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQU4H,1692376200,Saying Goodbye to The Airdrop,"Hi, everyone.  I have the unfortunate duty of informing you that this is the last edition of The Airdrop. We are enormously grateful to Rosie Perper for leading this project and to various other members of the CoinDesk team who helped pull it together each week. Sadly, after a round of layoffs and cost-cutting at CoinDesk this week, we will be unable to continue the newsletter. Rosie, along with other Web3 specialists Cam Thompson and Toby Bochan, will be sorely missed.  This is not to say that CoinDesk is abandoning Web3 content. While, for now, we are paring back our dedicated beat coverage of happenings in the NFT, Metaverse and DAO arenas, we remain committed to covering the technological, economic and cultural developments that underpin the Web3 vision for a new, decentralized version of the internet and creator economy. The sector may have lost some of the hype that surrounded the NFT boom of 2021, but this lull period has seen developers create a range of real-world applications of these exciting new technologies.  So, our mainstream coverage will continue to dive into this space as news warrants. We’ll also continue the weekly Gen C podcast with Sam Ewen, head of CoinDesk Studios, and Avery Akkineni, president of Vayner3. And as we prepare for Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas, next May, where the Gen C stage will host three summits addressing Web3-related themes, our features team will deliver plenty of dedicated long-form and opinion content to drive that Consensus Web3 conversation.  Before we sign off, it would be remiss of me not to highlight some notable Airdrop editions:  The $11M NFT Auction and Snoop Dogg’s Evolving Collection. Some brands and entertainers get it, others don't. Hip hop legend Snoop Dogg definitely belongs in the former category. Not only has he raised tens of millions of dollars with his NFT drops, but, as per the item highlighted here about his “evolving” tour-tied collection, Snoop has turned them into their creative outlet in their own right.  Nike Trips Up .SWOOSH Launch While Bitcoin NFTs Soar. One of the consistent themes of the NFT market since The Airdrop launched is that some of the projects that were launched during the boom period had some pretty serious teething problems. Nike’s high-profile SWOOSH platform is one such project; its digital sneaker launch didn’t exactly go all that smoothly.  OpenSea Goes Pro, Ralph Lauren Takes Crypto. Another big theme was the platform wars, as Blur sucked away a large amount of NFT sales from OpenSea by slashing fees and making it optional for traders to honor secondary-market royalty commitments to creators – features that were more appealing to active NFT traders rather than collectors. In April, OpenSea launched its attempt to take back some of that high-churn business, with OpenSea Pro.  That’s all for The Airdrop. Thanks for subscribing to it.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Points At “Fear” In The Market The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. This metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 for displaying the sentiment. All values above the 54 mark suggest the presence of greed among the investors, while those below 46 imply a majority mentality of fear. The region between these cutoffs reflects the neutral sentiment. As for how the index calculates the sentiment, Alternative.me, the creator of the metric, explains that it takes into account several different factors. Namely; volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends are what the indicator currently makes use of to pinpoint the market mentality. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index’s value looks like right now: The value of the metric seems to be inside the fear territory at the moment | Source: Alternative As you can see above, the index’s value is 37 currently, which suggests that the majority of the investors are fearful. This latest value of the indicator reflects a new shift in the sector, as prior to today, the indicator had been stuck inside the neutral territory for more than three weeks straight. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidations Top $500 Million Amid $1 Billion Crypto Decimation The below chart displays the trend in the fear and greed index over the past year. Looks like the value of the metric has taken a plunge recently | Source: Alternative From the graph, it’s visible how sharp this latest drop in the metric has been. In a flash, the market sentiment went from being completely neutral (50), to firmly inside the fear territory (37). The reason behind this hit to the investor mentality has been the sharp crash that Bitcoin has observed during the past day, as the cryptocurrency’s price has now slumped below $26,500. Earlier, when the index was consolidating in neutral territory, investors had been hesitant and undecided. But with this price action, it would appear that their mind has been made up, and they think that the asset would go down even lower. Historically, the market has actually tended to make moves that the majority of the holders aren’t expecting. The harder investors lean toward any one direction (fear or greed), the more probable price action of the opposite type becomes. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index also has two sub-sentiments inside fear and greed called extreme fear and extreme greed. These take place at values below 25 and above 75, respectively. Cyclical bottoms and tops in the asset have usually always formed whenever the market has been inside these zones, showcasing the aforementioned effect in action. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Volatility Continue? These Metrics Say Yes As the market hasn’t yet dipped too deep into the fear region, the probability of a bottom is likewise not raised too much yet. Back in March, however, Bitcoin did manage to find its bottom when the investors were fearful to a degree not much greater than right now. It now remains to be seen how the market sentiment will develop in the coming days, and if BTC will be able to find its bottom off the back of this fearful situation. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,400, down 10% in the last week.

However, it would seem this move was pushed back by the SEC as the asset manager has now filed a separate application to offer an Ether futures ETF. Valkyrie Moves To Offer Ethereum Futures ETF In an application dated August 16, Valkyrie seeks the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval to offer an Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). If approved, the fund will not directly invest in Ether. Instead, it will focus on purchasing several ether futures contracts to match the total value of the ether underlying the futures contracts with the net assets of the fund. Related Reading: Post-Hack Shenanigans: Curve (CRV) To Launch On TRON Following $2 Million Investment While this fund is relatively similar to the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has existed since 2021, it differs from the Spot Bitcoin ETF, which prominent institutional firms have filed for. Spot ETFs track the crypto asset’s price, while futures ETFs focus on the asset’s future contracts. Valkyrie categorically noted this fact as part of its application and stated that investors looking to invest in the price of ether directly should consider investments other than this particular fund. The application also highlighted the risks involved in investing in this fund as, according to Valkyrie, “the Fund’s investments could decline rapidly, including to zero.” As such, investors should understand that they could lose their entire investment. As is common with applications such as this, applicants must prove to the SEC that the underlying asset has a regulated market of significant size. And Valkyrie’s filing stated that its fund would be guided by the futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). ETH price recovers to $1,685 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com No First Mover Advantage? Valkyrie failed to clarify the status of its initial filing in its most recent application. The asset manager had previously tried to add ETH futures contracts to its Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) in a bid to gain a first-mover advantage over other applicants. Several other asset managers, including Bitwise, ProShares, Grayscale, and Volatility Shares, have also applied to offer an Ethereum futures ETF. However, it remains uncertain in what order the SEC is likely to approve (if it does) these applications, especially with this recent development. Related Reading: Ledger Users Can Now Buy Crypto Directly Using PayPal Just like Cathie Wood has suggested regarding the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications, the SEC can approve multiple applications at once, which will likely eliminate the first mover advantage, or it can decide to approve them in the order in which these applications came in. Despite expectations that the regulator will approve an Ether ETF this year, the probability of the SEC approving any of these applications remains uncertain as optimism dwindles.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the company not only acknowledged the devaluation of its Bitcoin assets but also indicated the possibility of divestment. A write-down in the context of cryptocurrency holdings refers to the reduction in the recorded value of a digital currency asset on a company’s balance sheet. This reduction typically occurs when the market value of the cryptocurrency drops significantly, leading to a situation where asset’s market value is now lower than its original purchase price or previously recorded value. In 2021, Musk publicly disclosed that SpaceX had entered the world of cryptocurrencies by acquiring an undisclosed amount of Bitcoin. Simultaneously, his other venture, Tesla, made headlines by revealing its plans to invest a whopping $1.5 billion in the digital currency. Related Reading: PayPal And The Crypto Conundrum: Understanding The UK Sales Suspension A Shift In Strategy For SpaceX Fast forward to the present, and it seems that SpaceX’s stance on Bitcoin has evolved. The company’s balance sheets for both 2021 and 2022 indicate that it valued its Bitcoin holdings at $373 million, only to subsequently record a write-down on these assets. The move comes amidst revelations that SpaceX’s expenditures for 2022 totaled around $5.2 billion, with an additional $5.4 billion directed toward property acquisition, equipment, research, and development. Bitcoin’s Recent Performance Coinciding with SpaceX’s reported actions, Bitcoin’s price has experienced notable fluctuations.

On August 18, the price of BTC suddenly dumped 8% in a matter of minutes, as tension from investors increased selling pressure. Bitcoin has endured many crashes of this magnitude in the past, and market corrections of this magnitude don’t come out of nowhere. So the recent plunge in BTC’s value could be due to several factors in the crypto industry and the global economy. Here are some theories about the factors that may have exacerbated the recent crash. SpaceX Reportedly Sells Off Its Bitcoin Holdings SpaceX, Elon Musk’s aerospace company, had reportedly sold off nearly all of its Bitcoin holdings. SpaceX, in addition to Tesla, was one of a few companies that bought Bitcoin during the bull run in 2021. According to reports, SpaceX held $373 million worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet in 2021 and 2022 but has now sold the cryptocurrency. Although it’s unclear when and how SpaceX sold its Bitcoin holdings, the news seems to have triggered selling pressure from investors. it’s funny how them selling last year or whatever causes a crash now — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) August 17, 2023 Fears Of Interest Rate Hikes By The Fed The US is one of the biggest markets for Bitcoin and recent revelations from the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting hint at the possibility of another increase in interest rates. The Fed controls interest rates in the US, and when they hike rates, it can have a significant impact on risky assets like BTC. Higher interest rates lead to increased borrowing costs and higher returns on safe investments like bonds, which may discourage trading in risky leveraged positions within the crypto space. BTC price suffers massive crash | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Futures Liquidations And Crypto Whales Selling Big Data from CoinGlass shows that the futures market has seen a flurry of liquidations in the past 24 hours. The market witnessed the largest futures liquidation this year, as BTC witnessed liquidations of $498.88 million. Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Wallet With 1,005 BTC Awakens, Sell Pressure Incoming? The data suggests most of the liquidated positions were longs, meaning traders were betting on Bitcoin’s price to rise. In the past 24 hours, the total liquidations come in at $1.04 billion, with $308.89 million and $27.56 million also coming from ETH and XRP liquidations. The Coinbase premium is up by +3%, implying some whales are dumping BTC on Binance. And when crypto whales sell large amounts of BTC, it can flood the market and further drive the price down. Bankrupt Chinese Property Giant China Evergrande, China’s second-largest property developer, recently filed for US bankruptcy. This seems to have had some sort of domino effect on the price of Bitcoin, as the bankruptcy news came at the cusp of the recent decline. Do you think this is in fear of evergrande and a domino effect or what could we be missing? — besadam.lens (@besada_m) August 17, 2023 Does This Imply A New Wave Of Extended Bearish Sentiment For Bitcoin? When Bitcoin crashes, it often brings the rest of the crypto market down with it. As such, the recent Bitcoin wipeout has led to a decrease in the price of other cryptocurrencies as well. Data from Coinmarketcap shows that Bitcoin is currently down by 7.06% in the past 24 hours. Major altcoin ETH, BNB, and XRP are also down by 5.77%, 5.19%, and 13.20%, respectively.

42409924,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQUoZ,1692360195,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Tumbles Below $26.5K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped 7% over the past 24 hours, plunging to levels not seen since June as the digital-asset market witnessed one of the worst sell-offs this year. Crypto traders were hit with $1 billion worth of liquidations over the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading at around $26,400 at the time of writing, but briefly fell to $25,234 on Thursday. Altcoins performed slightly better with ether (ETH) losing 6% over the same time period and Solana’s SOL losing around 5%. Traders say market structure and liquidations were a likely reason for the sudden drop instead of a singular fundamental catalyst. “We've seen BTC OI ramp up in position, with a bias to shorts,” said Decentral Park Capital trader Lewis Harland, in a message to CoinDesk. “The break below $28,500 led to material volumes of longs being liquidated. This has been combined with spot selling ahead of the date (likely anticipating further delays).”  Creditors of bankrupt crypto firm Celsius will hold a vote on the lender’s plan to sell assets to the Fahrenheit consortium, after a judge on Thursday approved disclosures that suggested creditors can expect to recover 67%-85% of holdings. Approval marks one of the final steps on Celsius’ year-long march out of bankruptcy and the return of funds to customers, in a period which has seen widespread disruption in crypto markets and the arrest of former Chief Executive Officer Alex Mashinsky on fraud charges, which he has denied.  Securities regulators are poised to approve ether futures ETFs for the U.S., Bloomberg reported on Thursday. Several firms have applied to list these exchange-traded funds, which would hold derivatives contracts tied to ether – rather than ether itself. But they need the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's blessing, something Bloomberg said might be imminent. There are already U.S. ETFs that hold crypto derivatives: bitcoin futures ETFs. The industry is anxiously awaiting word on whether ETFs that hold bitcoin itself, not derivatives, might also get approval. Wall Street giants like BlackRock are seeking to create those, too.  Chart of the day  The chart shows ether's dollar-denominated price on Binance and slippage or the difference between the price at which a trading order is executed and the price at which it was requested.  On Thursday, max slippage or the highest daily slippage on a single market order surged to highest since September 2022.  It shows worsening liquidity conditions in the market.

The result of this is a liquidation event, the likes of which have not been seen since the FTX collapse back in 2022. And Bitcoin’s numbers have shot up as long traders are completely obliterated in the process. Largest Single Crypto Liquidation Event In 2023 Following Bitcoin’s price decline to the low $25,000s, the liquidations picked up quickly with over $1 billion dollars of crypto positions being closed rapidly. Bitcoin, in particular, suffered the brunt of these liquidations as its numbers quickly climbed to 9 digits. Related Reading: Why Is Dogecoin Price Down Today? By the time Friday morning rolled around, the digital asset’s liquidation was at approximately $500 million with long traders suffering the majority of losses. According to data from Coinglass, Bitcoin’s long liquidation figures were already over $373 million, with shorts coming in at $125 million. BTC liquidations almost at $500 million | Source: Coinglass While Bitcoin was in the lead as expected, Ethereum was not that far behind. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap saw an even larger proportion of long liquidations compared to shorts. Out of the $308 million in liquidations, long traders lost $254.59 million while short traders came in at $54.3 million. Ethereum also saw the largest single liquidation order. The order which was worth $55.92 million at the time took place on the Binance crypto exchange across the ETH/BUSD pair. However, the OKX exchange saw the largest Ethereum liquidations at $108.87 million, 92.8% of which were longs. The Tide Is Starting To Turn For Bitcoin Following the initial plummet, Bitcoin began to show strength which saw its price add over $1,000. This recovery to $26,000 signaled a possible turn for the digital assets and the shorters began to feel the heat at this point. In the last four hours, long traders have gotten some reprieve as $8.53 million of the $10.96 million in liquidations so far were short trades. However, long traders are still not left out with $2.46 million in liquidations as well. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Price Cross $2,000 Before The End Of August? Since the Bitcoin price remains extremely volatile at this point, liquidation volumes are expected to rise. However, there is no indication so far of where the price of the digital asset might be headed next as bulls and bears continue a tug-of-war for control. Bitcoin is currently trading at a price of 26,451, representing a price decline of 7.48% over the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap. The asset has also seen a 110% increase in daily trading volume which is now sitting at $34.47 billion.

16183654,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547861,1692353136,Shiba Inu Price Shows Resilience As Shibarium Reboots: SHIB Price Targets,"Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 network, is still waiting for a reboot. At the time of going to press, Shibarium was still not producing any blocks, as Shibariumscan.io’s block explorer shows. As a reminder, Shiba Inu’s highly anticipated layer-2 went offline minutes after its official launch on Wednesday. In the wake of the unexpectedly high traffic that temporarily took the Shibarium network offline, the Shiba Inu team is diligently working on a solution to restore normalcy, the devs assured today. With many investors keeping a close eye on developments, there is one notable promise from the team – they emphasize that users’ funds are safe. When Shibarium went offline, $1.7 million was stuck in the ETH Bridge. Shibarium, which is a fork of the renowned Polygon network, saw an unprecedented number of “compute units” of traffic shortly after its launch. This influx resulted in, as Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya put it, “thousands upon thousands of contract creation and normal transactions IN A BLOCK.” As a result, the Shibarium network activated its failsafe mode and ceased operations to ensure the safety of assets within the blockchain. Related Reading: Buying The Dip? Shiba Inu Whale Activity Surges As Price Declines Nearly 10% In an update today, SHIB developer Kaal Dhairya wrote in a blog post: “Shibarium received millions of ‘compute units’ of traffic in a matter of moments. At that point, Shibarium’s amazing system went into failsafe mode and paused to make sure the funds were safe…. And they are.” The transparency of the Shiba Inu team continues to be evident as they not only recognize the current challenges, but actively seek expert assistance to address them. But the scaling issues seem to be bigger than expected, as the network is approaching a 48-hour downtime (with short interruptions). When Shiabrium will be back online is still unclear, Dhairya announced: “Tomorrow I will send another update to inform our army of the status of Shibarium Scaling!” Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shows Resilience The Shiba Inu price briefly fell back to $0.00000727 yesterday amid the market-wide crash, posting a 20% drop. However, SHIB managed to defend a new higher low (albeit just barely) – a bullish sign. Related Reading: Voyager Sells 1.4 Trillion Shiba Inu, But There’s Good News For SHIB In addition, SHIB bulls have succeeded in ushering in a recovery. At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00000838, currently trading just above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000833. A daily close above this price level would be a bullish exclamation point. This would open the possibility of a move up to the 200-day EMA at $0.00000935, which was lost on Wednesday as a result of the Shibarium stall. A quick bounce of the 200-day EMA would be a strong sign. As then, the area between the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000979 and the psychologically important $0.00001 level would come into focus. This area could be highly contested. However, if a breakout succeeds, the next targets are $0.00001096 (50% Fibonacci), $0.00001213 (61.8% Fibonacci) and $0.00001381 (78.6% Fibonacci) before the yearly high at $0.00001593 becomes the final hurdle for a bullish breakout of SHIB.

The position was made up of 38,986.528 ether (ETH) and liquidated at the $1,434 price level. That was nearly 30% of all liquidated futures on Binance, the data shows.  The unusual amount for a single trader suggests a large firm, or a large ether holder, was hit hard in yesterday’s steep drop.  Ether dropped from $1,780 to as low as $1,560 within minutes, with trading volume surging from $6 billion to over $20 billion across exchanges.  The asset then quickly recovered some of those losses amid late reports of U.S. securities regulators planning to approve ether (ETH) futures ETFs for trading in the country. ETH traded at just over $1,690 in Asian evening hours on Friday – down 6% in the past 24 hours.  Such a price drop in ether came amid one of the largest futures liquidations in over a year – higher than the market impact of crypto exchange FTX’s collapse.  Data suggests highly leveraged longs, or bets on, higher prices were taken out in a textbook long squeeze event amid unsubstantiated rumors of SpaceX selling its bitcoin holdings. The company merely wrote down the book value of its holdings, which was interpreted by sales in parts of the market, leading to selling pressure.  Bitcoin fell 7% in the past 24 hours, registering its largest drop in recent months amid a period of low volatility.

Funding rates on OKX, Deribit and Bybit crashed to -10% in annualized terms.  Funding rates in bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures listed worldwide crashed late Thursday after a sudden price slide put the recently popular short volatility bets at risk.  Perpetuals are futures with no expiry with a funding rate mechanism that helps tether perpetual prices to the index price. A negative funding rate suggests the dominance of bearish short positions, with shorts paying longs to keep their bets open. Positive rates indicate otherwise.  Funding rates on OKX, Deribit and Bybit crashed to -10% and more in annualized terms on Thursday, as bitcoin's average price tanked to $25,392, according to data source Velo. Bitcoin DVOL, the Deribit Implied Volatility Index gauging expected price turbulence over 30 days, jumped from an annualized 36% to 48.5%.  Perhaps traders who shorted options in recent weeks, a popular strategy to profit from a continued volatility lull, sold perpetual futures to hedge mitigate risks from volatility spike, pushing perpetuals into a steep discount and adding to the price swoon.  ""For BTC, option sellers were short too many put options, for more investors were previously bullish, selling put options to finance buying call options to reduce costs. So the sudden and unexpected price drop lead to hedging behavior, catalyzing deeper decline,"" Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said.  Per some pseudonymous market observers on Twitter, the sharp discount in Deribit's perpetual futures stemmed from the exchange selling perpetuals while liquidating a large short volatility position.  Deribit controls nearly 90% of the crypto options market. In other words, almost all volatility selling observed in recent weeks happened on Deribit. At one point late Thursday, Deribit's BTC perpetual futures traded at a discount of $2,000 to the cryptocurrency's average spot price across exchanges.  Lukk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, said the exchange has recently tweaked its liquidation policy, adding the steep discount in perpetual futures was negative funding rates worldwide.  ""Previously, Deribit only auto-liquidated options positions using perpetual/futures when possible, which was a form of Delta hedging as the first step to manage risk. Since early August, directly closing options positions has been a part of the liquidation algorithm as well. That logic has been changed to liquidate with whichever instrument is causing the issue and, therefore, more effective,"" Strijers told CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/18/bitcoin-perpetual-funding-rates-crash-as-price-slide-puts-short-volatility-bets-at-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b11a031740de49498024dcfb8ffc8bdc40212ff-1546x870.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its journey, marked by highs and lows, offers insights into the evolving dynamics of this speculative market. In a surprising turn of events, the meme coin arena witnessed a significant exchange of millions of SHIB and BONE tokens for PEPE, shortly after the successful launch of Shibarium’s mainnet.

The coin’s popularity has swung back and forth, indicating days of heightened interest juxtaposed with relative indifference. However, in the face of this up-and-down pattern, a notable trend emerged – the rise in the number of PEPE holders.

These gains are often followed by retracements, as shorting opportunities become available post-listing. PEPE is currently trading at $0.0000010965.

Approval marks a final stepping stone on Celsius’ year-long march out of bankruptcy and the return of funds to customers, in a period which has seen widespread disruption in crypto markets and the arrest of former Chief Executive Officer Alex Mashinsky on fraud charges, which he has denied.  Chris Ferraro, now in charge of the company as interim CEO, said in an emailed statement that “we remain laser focused on creating the best outcome for customers and creditors and returning value as soon as possible,” under a Chapter 11 procedure that started in July 2022 and is being supervised by New York Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn.  Creditors will be sent ballots to vote on the plan, involving the sale of assets to a consortium including Arrington Capital and miner U.S. Bitcoin Corp, between Aug. 24 and Sept. 22. Returns for creditors – which will largely be done in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) – could range from 67% for Earn Account holders to 85.6% for those participating in Celsius’ Borrow Program, compared to just 47% for a liquidation of assets, court filings said.  Other crypto bankruptcy plans have seen creditors vote massively for restructuring plans. In the case of crypto lender Voyager, some 97% of creditors opted in favor of a sale to Binance.US – albeit the buyer then abruptly pulled out following legal delays.  In July, Mashinsky was arrested on charges of securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to manipulate the price of Celsius' token CEL brought by multiple government agencies. The company itself was not prosecuted as it accepted responsibility and cooperated, and has said a $4.7 billion fine imposed by the Federal Trade Commission won’t affect plans to return funds to customers.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/18/celsius-creditors-to-vote-on-bankruptcy-escape-plan-after-judicial-approval,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61edc01fdb9a45354ec0a44db6cee10ed57b2d00-2036x1145.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meanwhile, the XRP price took a nosedive in the past 24 hours, falling 14.3% amidst the marketwide downturn. Ripple Partners With Mastercard Unveiling its CBDC Partner Program, Mastercard emphasized its intent to work with leading figures in the CBDC ecosystem. The objective: to offer central banks a comprehensive understanding of CBDCs and their potential for redefining the future monetary systems. Ripple, recognized as a “CBDC platform” in Mastercard’s media release, stands at the forefront of this ambitious initiative. “The inaugural set of partners includes CBDC platform Ripple, blockchain and Web3 software company Consensys, multi-CBDC and tokenized assets solution provider Fluency, digital identity technology provider Idemia, digital identity consultant Consult Hyperion, security technology group Giesecke+Devrient and digital asset operations platform Fireblocks,” Mastercard detailed in its announcement. Related Reading: Institutional XRP Holdings Rise Rapidly Following Ripple’s Win Over SEC Ripple’s recent accomplishments, such as the partnership with the Republic of Palau, which resulted in the launch of a government-issued stablecoin, further reinforce its position as a key player in the CBDC arena. Mastercard highlighted this collaboration as a testimony to Ripple’s capabilities, stating, “Ripple’s launch of an inaugural government-issued national stablecoin in collaboration with the Republic of Palau, in addition to work on four CBDC pilots.” Commenting on this collaboration, Mastercard’s CEO, Michael Miebach, stated, “We’re partnering with several central banks to help them research new digital currencies projects. It starts with understanding what they want to achieve with this technology, then building in transparency, consumer privacy and stability. We’re working toward those goals with a new #CBDC partner program, with Mastercard teaming up with a handful of key blockchain/Web3/payments players so we can learn from each other.” In response, Antony Welfare, CBDC advisor at Ripple, shared his enthusiasm, noting, “Excited to be working with Mastercard on #DigitalCurrency and CBDC projects.” Related Reading: Best-Selling Author Touts Buy XRP Now, But This Price Is Crucial Ripple’s involvement in the CBDC Partner Program is yet another testament to its growing influence in the domain.

42409951,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQfxc,1692338570,"No, Elon Musk's SpaceX Isn't the Cause of This Multi-Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Bloodbath","""Just woke up. WHO SOLD?""  This is what first crossed the mind of Reetika, a Dubai-based bitcoin (BTC) and crypto trader, during her usual routine of checking prices after waking up.  An unexpected and major sell-off in the crypto markets had jolted everyone after what had been a boring few weeks. Reetika's surprise was likely worldwide among traders and crypto hopefuls given how sudden and deep the losses were.  Bitcoin plunged on Thursday as traders sold the tokens en masse based on several unrelated catalysts, causing the crypto markets to lose 6.7% in overall capitalization in what marked one of the biggest drops in recent months.  As of about 06:00 UTC Friday, bitcoin had fallen as much as 9% over the past 24 hours to $25,000 from $28,500 on Binance, leading to a market-wide slump that sent major tokens like litecoin (LTC) tumbling by 14%. This caused more than $1 billion in crypto futures to be liquidated, a 14-month high.  Some pointed to space exploration company SpaceX’s supposed bitcoin sales – an unsubstantiated claim – while others said the bankruptcy of China Evergrande's may have had something to do with the fall. However, neither of these events are the probable cause.  A Wall Street Journal report late Thursday, citing internal company documents, noted Elon Musk's SpaceX had written down the value of its bitcoin holdings in 2021 and 2022 and has sold the cryptocurrency. But that report came out before the plunge, and there's zero evidence the company sold again Thursday.  Long squeeze and what really happened  Professional traders say market structure and liquidations were a likely reason for the sudden drop instead of a singular fundamental catalyst. The market has also been relatively illiquid and flat – creating conditions ripe for sudden movements.  “We've seen BTC [open interest] ramp up in position, with a bias to shorts,” said Decentral Park Capital trader Lewis Harland, in a message to CoinDesk. “The break below $28,500 led to material volumes of longs being liquidated. This has been combined with spot selling ahead of the date (likely anticipating further delays).”  Open interest refers to the number of unsettled futures contracts for any financial asset. In a flat market, the rapid building up of a significant amount of futures positions sometimes causes prices to fall quickly in the event of a large sell-off by an influential player.  That is because as prices fall, long traders have to sell their positions to avoid getting liquidated – adding to increased selling pressure, but, at the same time, creating an endless loop of falling prices and long position covering.  Data shows most long liquidations took place on crypto exchange OKX, accounting for nearly 40% of the entire market.  Some fundamental catalysts, however, are the rising interest rates in the U.S., as previously reported.  “U.S. interest rates are rising to multi-year highs. The 10-year yield has pushed to 15-year highs. This is bearish risk assets in general,” Harland added. “If this sell-off in bonds continues we could see continued negative price action in risk assets into the weekend.”  Elsewhere, analysts at on-chain data platform CryptoQuant told CoinDesk they expect sentiment to remain bearish in the days ahead – citing increased funding rates from short traders, or those who bet against prices.  Funding rates are periodic payments made by traders based on the difference between prices in the futures and spot markets. Depending on their open positions, traders will either pay or receive funding. The payments ensure there are always participants on both sides of the trade.  High rates can lead to price volatility, as traders are incentivized to be on one side of the market – thus increasing both futures and spot market movements.  Meanwhile, traders seem to be waiting on a Grayscale court ruling about the issuance of an exchange-traded fund (ETF), a ruling widely expected to be announced on Friday.  A federal appeals court will publish its ruling on the ongoing Grayscale vs. SEC case that would determine if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was unreasonable in its repeated denial of Grayscale’s proposed bitcoin ETF. The ruling, in Grayscale’s favor, is expected to create a marketwide surge, while the opposite could jolt markets further.  Omkar Godbole contributed reporting.

16170961,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547752,1692325855,Sei Takes A Hit: Price Suffers 26% Plunge Amid Airdrop Claim Expansion,"Sei, a specialized trading network within the Cosmos ecosystem, has recently recorded a significant downward trend. Notably, on a day rife with anticipation, the price of Sei plunged by more than 20%, plummeting from its initial spike above $0.28 to somewhere below $0.18. This decline coincided with the Sei Foundation’s decision to open airdrop claims, arguing free tokens are often distributed to early participants or testers of a new crypto project. Related Reading: SEI Token Breaks Into Top 100 One Day Post-Debut On Major Exchanges Airdrop Details And The Impact On Sei’s Price The crypto community has since waited with bated breath for the Sei blockchain to launch and initiate its airdrop. And finally, on August 15, Sei launched its mainnet beta, with the airdrop initiatives happening after. Today, the blockchain reported an upsurge in the number of wallets eligible for the airdrop. Initially planned for 500,000 wallets, the number swelled to roughly 1.5 million in response to what the foundation termed “fervent demand.” Due to fervent demand, Sei Foundation has increased the number of eligible wallets for the cross-bridge airdrop from 500K to 1.5M on @ethereum, @0xPolygonLabs, @arbitrum, @BNBCHAIN, @solana, @optimismFND and @osmosiszone. — Sei Foundation (@Sei_FND) August 17, 2023 This enlargement incorporated users from a variety of blockchain networks, including but not limited to Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, and Solana. From its coin supply, the Sei team earmarked 3% specifically for the airdrop. This translates to a figure of 300 million coins. To put this into perspective, according to a report by Binance, these coins form a significant chunk of the 1.8 billion Sei coins currently circulating out of 10 billion coins. Sei Price Plunges More Than 20% In The Past Day Sei has plummeted by more than 20% over the past 24 hours. This plummet contributes to the asset’s fall from its rank among the top 100 in crypto on the day of launch to a current rank of 107 among the most prominent crypto by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. Despite the token’s listing on exchanges such as Binance, it has seen quite a plunge in the past day with a current market price of $1.80, a 22% drop from its initial trading price above $0.25. The reason behind Sei’s plummet is evident as it comes amid the asset’s airdrop expansion. It is worth noting that an event such as an airdrop can often trigger a cascade of sell-offs as eligible users rush to convert their newfound assets into cash or other cryptocurrencies. Alongside its declining value, Sei’s market capitalization plunged from $413 million on Wednesday to $319 million at the time of writing. The asset’s trading volume has declined from a high of $1.2 billion yesterday to $705 million in the past 24 hours.

Within the span of just 24 hours, the coin experienced a 13% decline in value. The swift sell-off, which began on August 16, triggered a cascading effect that sent LUNC’s price plummeting from its recent peg of $0.00007734 to a new low of $0.00006512. While this may appear as a dramatic swing, it echoes the bearish sentiment that has persistently lingered around the coin throughout the past month. Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Empowers Smart Contracts With Upgrades – Positive Impact On Price? LUNC Battles To Maintain Essential Support For a duration exceeding three weeks, LUNC’s price showcased resilience as it managed to keep itself above a crucial support zone resting at $0.000076. This period of relative stability served as a reflection of the overarching uncertainty pervading in the market. However, with the breach of this monthly support threshold, experts caution that the existing selling pressure could magnify significantly. This breach also carries the potential to indicate a prolonged period of downward movement for the Terra classic coin. Beyond The Surface Scrutinizing the Luna Classic community on Twitter reveals a landscape marred by internal conflicts, particularly concerning the governance protocols. Recent days have witnessed heated debates revolving around the proposed implementation of the LUNC DAO validator, which would have assumed a prominent role in leading the chain. Unfortunately, this proposal met its end, and the aftermath was telling – a substantial sell-off unfolded. This is undeniable proof that OX DAO (Formerly known as $LUNC Dao) is trying to take over #LUNC by dumping the price. pic.twitter.com/kqtDdwIxbr — Classy 🔮 (@ClassyCrypto_) August 15, 2023 Notably, Crypto Classy, a prominent LUNC validator, alleges that the sell-off was meticulously orchestrated by the LUNC DAO itself. The assertion is that the DAO orchestrated deliberate coin sales to incite panic within the investor community, ultimately facilitating coin repurchases at lower prices – a move perceived as an attempt to gain control over the network. Impact On Price Dynamics The repercussions of these recent events reverberate through LUNC’s price dynamics. As per CoinGecko’s data, the coin currently hovers around $0.00006770. A decline of 2.4% over the past 24 hours coupled with a substantial seven-day slump of 12.5% underscores the mounting strain that the coin is grappling with. Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) is currently trading at $0.00006703.

Curve Set To Launch On Tron And BTTC Networks Decentralized Exchange, Curve Finance has solidified its position as the second largest DEX, following the announcement of its integration into the TRON network. Curve Finance’s recent alliance with the TRON network has prompted a substantial investment from TRON DAO Ventures, a venture capital firm established by the TRON network. On Thursday, August 17, TRON Founder, Justin Sun purchased $2 million worth of CRV, the native token of the DeFi protocol. Similarly, Curve Finance has stated that it will be launching on the BitTorrent Chain (BTTC) network, a peer-to-peer network blockchain scaling solution for file and data sharing. The Integration of the protocol into TRON DAO and BTTC networks aims to fuel the development of innovative DeFi projects and the growth of DeFi ecosystems. Curve Finance is widely known for its role in stable coin trading by providing low slippage exchanges through automated market maker (AMM) algorithms. By aligning with the protocol, TRON and BTTC will benefit from lower financial costs and indirect backing from prominent blockchains Curve DAO supports including Avalanche, Ethereum, and Arbitrum. Justin Sun welcomed the newly formed alliance with enthusiasm. He commented that Curve Finance plays a pivotal role in the DeFi ecosystem and blockchain industry and looked forward to new innovative solutions promoted by the partnership. “Curve is an essential DeFi infrastructure for the blockchain industry. Our thoughts are with the team and the users affected. As a community, let’s support and strengthen the security measures to protect our decentralized ecosystem,” Sun stated. CRV price resting at $0.54 | Source: CRVUSDT on Tradingview.com Compensation For Hack Victims Following Tron Alliance The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape was previously shaken up following news of a hack on the DEX. On July 30, Curve Finance fell victim to a reentrancy attack that exploited vulnerabilities in its smart contract codes, resulting in a loss of $62 million. Following the news of the hack attack, the CRV token declined and the majority of the DeFi ecosystem was in panic. However, Curve Finance has reportedly recovered 70% of the funds and to recover the rest of the stolen funds, the protocol has placed a bounty on the attacker, promising $1.85 million to anyone able to reveal the hacker’s identity. Curve Finance has also promised to compensate victims of the security breach. The DEX has stated that it will distribute reimbursements fairly as they determine the extent of damages and work toward recovering the stolen funds.
