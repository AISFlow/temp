42397228,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAanzAu,1378911376,CoinDesk launches proprietary Bitcoin Price Index,"Mr. Charles Dow and Mr. Edward Jones probably felt this way at the launch of their now-famous average. A benchmark price index established by a reputable publisher is a significant milestone for any industry. Its importance becomes amplified with the benefit of hindsight.  This week, CoinDesk launches its proprietary Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) aiming to establish the standard retail price reference for industry participants and accounting professionals. Wholesale exchanges and dark pools may trade around other price points, but those are usually private trades and not available to retail businesses and individuals.  The new CoinDesk index represents an average of leading global bitcoin exchanges but the formula is flexible enough to maintain only those exchange rates that conform to certain minimum criteria for price discovery and validity. Initially, those specific criteria are defined as:  (a) exchange must serve an international customer base;  (b) minimum trade size must be less than 1,500 USD or equivalent;  (c) banking transfers in or out of the exchange must be completed within seven days without special fees.  It is believed that this is preferable to simply discarding the outlier price because in some instances the outlier price may be the most accurate.  According to CoinDesk developers, the criteria are subject to modification based on changing market and regulatory conditions and they intend to keep any revisions to the formula on a predictable monthly schedule. This will increase the credibility of the index because users will have some advance notice with respect to the formula updates and associated rationale for those updates.  Starting a new index can be a tricky endeavor because it must appeal to the lowest common denominator to be broadly applicable yet it must be selective enough to maximize market-based price discovery.  The Mt. Gox exchange price had been the early leader in terms of adopted usage of their API, but increasingly that has caused problems for companies attempting to benchmark average price while not having adequate access to the Gox platform. Due to Mt. Gox banking delays in transferring US dollars out, a spread of approximately 10% has existed between Mt. Gox and other bitcoin exchanges for several months now causing distortion in real-time conversions that depended on the API. This spread has been as high as 20% at times. As a result, businesses such as BitPay and LocalBitcoins.com have already moved away from using the Gox pricing API.  Initially, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index will be based on XBT/USD price data from Bitstamp, BTC-e, and CampBX using each exchange's bid/ask midpoint and without volume-weighting. The decision not to weight the component exchange prices based on trading volume was made because the bitcoin market is currently not deep enough. It tends to be more dispersed by region and a volume-weighted index would not act as a proper global indicator. This is expected to change over time as more bitcoin exchanges gain trading volume in different countries thereby weakening the impact of regional variances. At that point, it is anticipated that the bitcoin market would be mature enough to apply a volume-weighted approach.  In addition to a real-time API updated every 60 seconds, CoinDesk will provide a GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) end-of-day closing index price including a high price and a low price for the daily trading period. The historical index data will commence on July 1st, 2013 and any data prior to that date will be based on the Mt. Gox price data previously recorded by CoinDesk. Therefore, users will see a drop in the historical index from June 30th, 2013 to July 1st, 2013 but the transition and formula details will be cited in the explanatory notes.  The representation of the Bitcoin Price Index in other national currency units will be provided by applying exchange rates from openexchangerates.org until those other bitcoin trading pairs reach sufficient trading volume. That level will most likely be reached earliest by the XBT/EUR trading pair.  The XBT designation as bitcoin's ISO 4217 currency code is accepted by both XE.com and OANDA for their current data feed. As Bloomberg terminal and other trading platforms adopt XBT, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index could increasingly become the de facto metric for recording historical and current exchange rates for bitcoin.

Editor's update:  As of 1st October 2013, the Bitcoin Foundation is using the CoinDesk BPI to determine its membership fees.  Lindsay Holland Cromwell, assistant director of the Bitcoin Foundation, explained: ""There is a fixed dollar amount for each membership level which is then pegged to the BPI. We chose to switch to the CoinDesk BPI because we felt it most accurately represents the market price of bitcoin.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Jon Matonis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/11/coindesk-launches-proprietary-bitcoin-price-index,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b66b6a71deb3837e39542ec83eeb9362f3b6b3ea-1256x812.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397217,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAanz32,1378906504,Belgium's finance minister has no objection to bitcoin,"Belgium’s finance minister has no problem with bitcoin, he said last week, although he pointed out that there are few people there using it.  Minister of finance Koen Geens responded to a parliamentary question about bitcoin, commenting that he wouldn't see the Belgian National bank having any objection to bitcoin, and stating that for the moment its use is limited to a handful of traders.  The nation’s anti-money laundering organization – the Cellule de Traitement des Informations Financières - hasn't received any guidance on the cryptocurrency.  Geens reportedly added that although privacy and anonymity were a big part of bitcoin, there was no indication that the cryptocurrency is used on a large scale for money laundering. Any exchange of large amounts of bitcoin would be detected by the financial control systems, he argued.  Chris D’Costa, chair of the Belgium chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation, admits that the Belgian bitcoin economy has yet to develop.  There are some promising signs, though, with biweekly meet-ups, which have created some innovative projects including the first full bitcoin client on Raspberry Pi, he says. These in turn have spawned other projects.  “Unfortunately, the minister is correct. There really aren't many startups using bitcoin here just yet, and that was my main motivation in starting the Foundation Chapter - to bring about some education into the start-up scene,” says D’Costa.  However, he also points out that Brussels is the center of the European political system, calling it the “heart of Europe”. Although it isn’t the official capital of the EU (the EU doesn’t have one), it has long been seen as the EU’s de facto home.  Tuur Demeester, Belgian publisher of investment newsletter MacroTrends.be, says that he knows several Belgian investors who are considering investments in the space, including Barend Van den Brande of technology VC fund Hummingbird Ventures.  “I think in the medium term, bitcoin's safe haven attribute will prove to be its major point of attraction for Belgians,” Demeester said. “Quiet as things may seem on the surface, I sense a strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the way the authorities are handling the problem of bureaucratization and overspending.”  D’Costa, who is himself developing a bitcoin wallet project called Meek, has been working with a local accountant to obtain a formal position from the Finance Ministry.  “I feel positive that existing regulation will class bitcoin as a foreign currency and treat it as such for tax purposes. This would be very good for Belgium, because foreign exchange gains do not attract capital gains tax,” he says.  Germany, which is the EU's largest economic power, made its own advances in this area last month, when its own finance ministry officially recognized bitcoin as private money.  The Belgian chapter will hold elections for board members in October, and it will follow a similar non-profit strategy to the main US-based Foundation, with legal and financial experts holding board or advisory positions.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/11/belgiums-finance-minister-has-no-objection-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1594ed71710cec1acbc95b79280485ff3b572332-1000x657.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397214,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAanyz6,1378895518,Rogue transaction cripples casual bitcoin software users,"Multiple versions of the bitcoin client began failing this week, after a rogue transaction stopped users from restarting the software.  The problems first surfaced early Monday morning US time, with a message on the Bitcoin Talk forum.  “Just opened my laptop and started Bitcoin QT and received the message blockchain corrupt, I clicked OK and now it appears ""Reindexing blocks - 204 weeks,” said the poster. “Also, my Bitcoins are Unconfirmed. What happened, why the message?”  Others quickly reported the same error on multiple computers, running different versions of Bitcoin-QT, which is the standard graphical user interface (GUI)-enabled version of the bitcoin client. Reindexing the blocks using the bitcoin client failed to solve the problem. The same problem affected Bitcoind, which is the non-GUI-based version of the client.  The problem was a result of a bug originally introduced in version 0.8.0 of the bitcoin client, which was first released in February. That version was a major release, which switched the database used to store the block chain from Berkeley DB to LevelDB, to solve a security problem.  “It is a bug in our code that checks for LevelDB database inconsistencies introduced when we switched to LevelDB storage in the 0.8.0 release, combined with a bug that checks the version number in transactions,” said Gavin Andresen, chief developer. “A transaction with a bad version number triggered the problem.”  Gregory Maxwell, another member of the core developer team, posted a workaround for the problem yesterday morning. He explained to CoinDesk that since 0.8.0, the software has stored transactions with negative version numbers incorrectly in the local version of the block chain.  ""This incorrect behaviour is, by itself, harmless and until yesterday there had not been any transactions with a negative version.""  However, on Monday, such a transaction was released, and stored in the client. Because the software enforces a rigorous database consistency check that runs whenever it is started, it refused to start after these transactions were included in the chain, he said.  Neither Andresen or Maxwell said that they had seen any evidence of significant network disruption. Andresen pointed out that it doesn't affect the biggest, critical pieces of network infrastructure such as mining pools, merchants, or exchanges, because they tend to keep their bitcoin software running, usually with multiple nodes.  “Since the issue is easily worked around (once you find instructions) I suspect this means that it is likely a much bigger source of frustration than it is an actual disruption,” Maxwell said.  So, where did the transactions come from? Maxwell traced them to some reused addresses. He pointed to a bitcoin wallet developer, whose software was failing to initialize the version before sending a transaction. ""This is a difficult mistake to make, especially in C code,” he said, adding that the wallet’s Github page is now offline. “Perhaps he took it offline due to this bug.”  The bug may have been merely frustrating, but it also shows how network attacks can be mounted – even inadvertently and non-maliciously – by simply serving up a transaction that confuses the system thanks to a long-standing bug. In this case, it was simply a malformed transaction, warping a piece of data that was not actively used by the bitcoin client.  ""If the error had been in something that was used, it would have been a very serious fork-creating bug,"" Maxwell said. This would require a corresponding vulnerability in the code, however.  The core development team is now working on a fix. “Once we're confident we have a good fix and the problem can't be triggered in some other way, we'll release a 0.8.5 version,” Andresen concluded.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/11/rogue-transaction-cripples-casual-bitcoin-software-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/131ecdf194b2ff18b60b4fcb7185eb9a3068cdee-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
