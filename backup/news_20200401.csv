On a 24-hour basis, bitcoin (BTC) was in the red 4 percent Wednesday afternoon Eastern time and ether (ETH) was down 3 percent. Most other cryptocurrencies were off as well.      Notable assets down in the dumps on CoinDesk’s big board include NEO (NEO) in the red 5 percent, bitcoin SV (BSV) slipping 4 percent and IOTA (IOTA), down 4 percent. All price changes are in the past 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.      In the traditional markets, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index closed down 4.5 percent. Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day in the red 2.7 percent. In the U.S., the S&P 500 closed New York’s trading day down 4.4 percent.      See also: As Crypto Prices Reeled in Q1, These Coins Stood Out      Traders continue to have concerns about coronavirus’ impact on the world economy, as the World Health Organization says inflections will surpass one million people causing 50,000 total deaths globally in a matter of days.      After holding steady Tuesday, bitcoin slipped from $6,450 at 00:00 UTC Wednesday to as low as $6,160 around 17:00 UTC on exchanges such as Coinbase. An outstanding question is how long the cryptocurrency will continue to track traditional investments during this period of turmoil.       “Bitcoin tends to have periods of spurious correlation with macro risk, but it is not statistically significant,” said Darius Sit, managing partner at crypto fund QCP Capital. “At the time of market panic even gold was correlated with equities but that is starting to break as well.”      Indeed, gold rallied to start Wednesday, and though it did come under some sell pressure it is up less than a percent on the day as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. EDT).       “Gold is one of the best-performing assets in Q1. Gold rose 2.95 percent, which is a great result compared to other asset classes which faced losses,” said, Nemo Qin, an analyst at brokerage eToro.      Where does crypto go from here? Some think the worst is over after last month’s collapse of bitcoin, which briefly dipped below the $4,000 level March 13.      Despite that bloodbath, the first quarter saw bitcoin perform better than the S&P 500 index even though it was still in the red 10 percent for the period.      “For what it's worth, we believe the lows are behind us in this new macro regime and that expectations have been heavily subdued,” said Vishal Shah, founder of crypto derivatives exchange Alpha5. “At worst, this should lead to the creation of price troughs not too far from here, and at best, provide sustained fuel for a move higher.”      Another open question is whether the upcoming halving of bitcoin block rewards will have its usual effect of boosting the price. For one thing, the options market is expressing pessimism about the halving, expected to occur in mid-May.      See also:Bitcoin Halving, Explained      In theory, by reducing the amount new bitcoins released into circulation every 10 minutes or so, the halving should juice the price, assuming demand stays constant. But the unusual turbulence, and the way bitcoin has reacted to it so far, calls that assumption into question.      “It’s still a tiny space with low liquidity all over crypto. I honestly have my eyes on hashrate and think a lot about how the halving effect will look this time,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter trader.      In fact, a large U.S. cryptocurrency miner recently shut off its machines, claiming unprofitability at current price levels.      Despite all this, some traders still have confidence in crypto, expecting it to decouple from traditional markets at some point whenever things settle.      “I think when there is market panic and deleveraging going on, it's normal for BTC as a fringe asset to follow the general trend. But once markets are calmer it can start to move according to its own narrative,” said QCP’s Sit.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/01/bitcoin-takes-tumble-traders-fret-correlation-and-next-months-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36da5b6c995311a0493f8b1deb0f46c3a3304f99-752x426.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404330,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhuTj,1585771221,Blockstack Wins Patent for Its Dapp Single Sign-On Product,"Blockstack, the control-your-data decentralized web developer, has patented the process behind its single sign-on for every dapp system, Blockstack Auth.      The patent covers Blockstack’s method for cryptographically signing into dapps with a single digital identity, without requiring a third party to authenticate.      The system received USPTO’s approval on March 24 following an uncharacteristically short eight month wait – most applications sit for about 32 months, according to Erickson Law Group – and exactly three years after Blockstack’s 2017 release of the Auth developer version.      Blockstack Auth aims to be Web 3.0’s one-password-to-rule-them-all, the patent documents show. It’s functionally similar to Google and Facebook’s massively popular one-click sign in processes that integrate with hundreds of thousands of websites.      “But the underlying data flow is unlike” the big tech’s OAuth protocol-reliant authentication services, the patent description reads. Those third-party platforms remove user control by checking all information against their centralized servers. Serverless Blockstack Auth gives it back – through public key cryptography.      The process works by exchanging JSON web tokens between the dApp and the Blockstack browser. At sign in, the dApp generates an “ephemeral transit key” whose public portion it sends to the browser through an “authRequest” token. The browser in turn encrypts an “app-private key” with that public portion, which it then returns to the dApp in an “authResponse” token.      “This inventive realization obviates the need for a server-side identity provider,” the patent read.      The patent’s language is at times nearly identical to Blockstack's March 10, 2020, explainer article on Blockstack Auth, with verbatim subheadings and subtle differences attributable to the less declarative voice with which applicants write submissions.      (For example, the patent reads: “These tokens can be related to JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and they can be passed via URL query strings,” whereas the GitHub-editable March 10 explainer reads: “These tokens are JSON Web Tokens, and they are passed via URL query strings.”)    Open source, closed ownership    The granting, Blockstack’s first, gives legal clout to the Public Benefit Corporation’s universal login tool for the decentralized web. But intellectual property rights bring more than just legal protection for the GitHub-loving Blockstack. It also prompts thorny questions about partitioning off ideas in a space, and by a company that claims to put open-source at the “heart of everything we do.”      Two days after the patent’s issuance, Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali opened a forum to discuss “Blockstack PBC and patents.” CoinDesk was directed to the forum after reaching out to Blockstack for this story.      “We don’t want to be in a position where some other (large) company files a patent similar to the work PBC and the community is doing,” he wrote, pointing to the “recent surge” of big tech companies, such as IBM, that file seemingly endless reams of blockchain patent applications.      Ali wrote that Blockstack may file patents on its core team’s efforts – purely for “‘defensive’ reasons.” He left the door open on transferring patents to the independent Stacks Foundation, procuring a defensive patent license, or even pledging to never initiate enforcement, as Tesla did in 2014.      The discussion partially answers questions raised in November 2017, when Twitter user @lightcoin, who had come across a separate Blockstack patent still waiting for approval, called on the firm to explain its patent strategy.      “Patents are like nuclear weapons: the best way to prevent them from being abused is to not create them in the first place,” @lightcoin said.      At the time Ali said Blockstack had to stake its claims before others did. He promised to “post about our future patent strategy” at a later date.      The debate is similar to one crypto exchange Coinbase faced. CEO Brian Armstrong said in the past that he believes “patents should be abolished” but, like Blockstack, sees it as necessary to build a portfolio for “defensive” reasons.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | STX,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/01/blockstack-wins-patent-for-its-dapp-single-sign-on-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e99e271bbc3d8fdf48012814322dd7edebc36c47-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404338,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhudZ,1585764017,Online Black Markets' Bitcoin Revenues Take a Hit Amid Pandemic,"The coronavirus pandemic has touched every corner of the world economy – even the seedy underbelly of internet commerce.      Customers spent fewer bitcoins at darknet markets over the last two months despite the slide in the cryptocurrency's price, according to data from blockchain surveillance firm Chainalysis.      Darknet markets are websites that facilitate the sale of illegal goods, usually drugs, counterfeit currencies and weapons.      ""Historically, darknet markets’ revenue (value of bitcoins sent to dark markets) has had a weak inverse correlation with bitcoin’s price,"" according to Chainalysis. That relationship, however, has reversed over the last two months, as seen in the chart below.      Bitcoin topped out at $10,500 in mid-February and fell as low as $3,867 on March 13. As prices fell, so did the value of bitcoins sent to darknet markets from $4.1 million to $3.2 million.      However, the value of bitcoins sent to dark markets had risen from $3.9 million to just over $5 million during the final quarter of 2019. In that same period, the cryptocurrency had declined by nearly 13 percent and hit a low of $6,400 in mid-December.      The latest change in correlation has come amid a health crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, began spreading at a faster rate in Asian countries in February and hit the European and American shores in March.      See also: Bitcoin All-Time High in 2020? Chances Are Only 4%, Options Market Signals      As a result, traditional markets tanked, triggering a liquidity crisis, which saw investors sell classic haven assets like gold for cash, mainly the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin, too, was treated as a source of liquidity.      Darknet vendors may have panicked due to sudden drop in prices and slowed down sales out of fear that the cryptocurrency could become worthless in a cataclysmic event. Also, darknet customers may have scaled back purchases as, during times of panic, investors tend to hold onto cash.      While the exact reason for the drop in darknet markets' revenue is not clear, the report by Chainalysis suggests COVID-19 made it harder to sell drugs.      ""Recent reports point out that Mexican drug cartels are having a harder time sourcing fentanyl, as China’s Hubei province — a hub of the global fentanyl trade — has been hit hard as the epicenter of the outbreak. Such disruptions to global supply chains could be hampering darknet market vendors’ ability to do business,"" the firm said.      Merchant services and gambling providers have also seen drops in revenue over the past few weeks.      The seven-day average of the value of bitcoins sent to merchant services fell from $7 million to $4.5 million in the five weeks to the end of March. Meanwhile, the value of bitcoins sent to gambling services declined from $5 million to $3 million.      See also: Crypto Markets Can Never Close, and That’s a Good Thing      Again, the decline seen in these sectors is not surprising, as people tend to save more during recessions.

42404326,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhuRl,1585762097,Judge Denies Telegram's Request to Issue Gram Tokens to Non-US Investors,"A federal judge has denied Telegram's request to issue its forthcoming gram tokens to non-U.S. investors.      U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel, of the Southern District of New York, wrote on Wednesday that Telegram's claim it could issue its tokens to investors but ensure these tokens did not end up in U.S. investors' hands was unconvincing. He rejected a request by the messaging platform to clarify his earlier preliminary injunction preventing any gram issuance.      The order came as the latest stage of Telegram’s six-month court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which asked the court to halt the launch of the messaging app company’s blockchain project TON and prevent Telegram from issuing tokens, called grams, to the buyers of its $1.7 billion token sale in 2018.      Citing the lack of SEC’s jurisdiction over the overseas investors, Telegram suggested that it “will implement safeguards to protect against non-U.S. Private Placement purchasers reselling Grams to U.S. purchasers in the future,"" including a condition that non-U.S. investors can only receive their grams if they are not going to resell them in the U.S., and configuring the digital wallet to cut off Americans.      The argument did not convince the judge, who wrote:      “Focusing upon the Initial Purchasers and their Gram Purchase Agreements misses one of the central points of the Court’s Opinion and Order, specifically, that the 'security' was neither the Gram Purchase Agreement nor the Gram but the entire scheme that comprised the Gram Purchase Agreements and the accompanying understandings and undertakings made by Telegram, including the expectation and intention that the Initial Purchasers would distribute Grams into a secondary public market.”      The judge also was not impressed by the proposed measures to fence off the U.S. investors, writing that Telegram did not actually explain how it could prevent secondary sales or how it could lawfully modify the Gram Purchase Agreements to create this restriction.      “... [F]undamentally, the TON Blockchain was designed and is intended to grant anonymity to those who purchase or sell Grams,"" he wrote.      Investors ""could simply disclaim having a U.S.-based address,"" he said.      The order also points out that the question of the SEC’s jurisdiction has not been previously raised by Telegram, and said at this point it is too late to consider it.      Gabriel Shapiro, a blockchain and crypto-focused attorney, told CoinDesk the judge apparently understands the nature of blockchain technology quite well and highlighted Telegram's ""underplaying the significance of its request for clarity and overplaying the efficacy of its proposed U.S. geofencing.""      ""I think it's clear that Judge Castel agreed fully with the SEC that Telegram's post-injunction arguments about extraterritoriality are 'too little, too late,'"" he said. ""His response to Telegram's 'request for clarification' also displays admirable technological savvy and skepticism, as he recognized that Telegram's offer to KYC-gate the TON wallet does not fundamentally limit the distribution of GRAMs through other possible wallets built on the open-source TON blockchain protocol.""      Telegram said it would appeal Judge Castel's injunction late last week.",NEGATIVE,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TON | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/01/judge-denies-telegrams-request-to-issue-gram-tokens-to-non-us-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5791b45398fc8d1f7bc3ab9c870d193d111d1e4a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404339,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhueY,1585758906,"As Crypto Prices Reeled in Q1, These Coins Stood Out","The first quarter of 2020 will be remembered as a period when the coronavirus-led uncertainty set off a liquidity crisis in financial markets, forcing investors to sell everything, including bitcoin (BTC).      The top cryptocurrency, often touted as a safe haven, fell by 10 percent in the first three months of 2020.      While the cryptocurrency eked out 30 percent gains in January amid the U.S.-Iran tensions, it could not withstand the bearish pressures emanating from the global dash for cash in March.      The broader crypto market also suffered losses in the first quarter, as evidenced from the 5 percent decline in the total market capitalization, according to TradingView.      However, a few cryptocurrencies including the privacy coin dash and link, the native token of decentralized oracle network Chainlink, managed to put in a positive performance. Even the most actively traded cryptocurrencies have thin volumes compared to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, so ascribing market movements to fundamentals remains a tricky exercise in this young, speculative market. However, developments such as evidence of real-world adoption or new business partnerships may have played a role in these coins' gains.      See also: How Financial Models Could Move Bitcoin’s Price After the Halving      The following are notable winners and losers of the first quarter among 19 major assets featured in the forthcoming CoinDesk Quarterly Review. The list is curated to exclude cryptocurrencies with less than 12 months of trading history, and daily trading volume of less than $5 million. The list does not include stablecoins. CoinDesk Research will publish the Q1 edition of the Review this month.    Winners      Dash      Quarterly performance: +63 percent      Rank by market capitalization: 19      Market capitalization: $606 million      Current price: $64      Dash (dash), the 19th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, jumped nearly 63 percent to register its best quarterly performance since the final quarter of 2017, according to data source Messari Pro.      Back then, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency had rallied by a staggering 217 percent amid the bull market frenzy in the crypto markets.      The latest quarterly gain is largely the result of January's stellar 180 percent price rise. While the majority of prominent cryptocurrencies outperformed bitcoin's 30 percent rise in January, dash went a step further by scoring triple-digit gains, possibly due to increased adoption in Venezuela's hyperinflated economy.      ""Dash established meaningful collaborations with international brands including Burger King in Venezuela and Germany. These collaborations, coupled with lower transaction costs and a faster transaction experience than bitcoin, further promote dash’s narrative of day-to-day usability,"" said Nemo Qin, an analyst at the multi-asset investment platform eToro.      The team behind dash has certainly been pushing that narrative. ""Venezuela is now the world's leading market for crypto adoption,"" Ernesto Contreras, the chief of the Dash Core Group, declared in a blog post on Jan.11.      See also: Bitcoin All-Time High in 2020? Chances Are Only 4%, Options Market Signals      Some observers, however, challenged the dash community’s claim of massive adoption, accusing the cryptocurrency's Venezuelan team of fabricating merchant usage numbers. Peter McCormack, host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, said in February that Dash was exploiting Venezuela with propaganda. Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core Group countered skeptics with a detailed post outlining dash's increasing usage in Venezuela.      Taylor's assurances, however, did not stop the cryptocurrency from taking a hit in February and March alongside sharp losses in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency fell 23 percent in March, but still ended the quarter with outsized gains.      Link      Quarterly performance: +31.5 percent      Rank by market capitalization: 14      Market capitalization: $2 billion      Current price: $2.24      Link, the 14th largest cryptocurrency, closed the first quarter with 31.5 percent gains, having put in dismal performances in the preceding two quarters.      At one point, in early March, the native cryptocurrency of the Chainlink network was trading at record highs above $5.00, representing a staggering 200 percent year-to-date gain.       ""Chainlink is benefitting from the shift in focus from base layer smart contracts like Ethereum to oracles, which began in 2019,"" Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, a blockchain technology company, said in early March.      A decentralized oracle network built on top of Ethereum, Chainlink connects smart contracts to real-world data, events and payments. An oracle is a third-party information source, whose sole purpose is to supply data to blockchains. So for example, if two users bet on the outcome of a soccer match, the oracle will tell the smart contract which team won, so it can pay the winning bettor.      Chainlink has made encouraging noises over the last 12 months or so with multiple partnerships that look like the product of relentless business development and go-to-market strategy, as noted by Spencer Noon, head of crypto investments at DTC Capital.      Recently, decentralized finance (DeFi) platform bZx integrated Chainlink's solutions recently following the major hack in February. Meanwhile, Celsius Network, a crypto lending and borrowing platform, announced on Monday that it has entered into a partnership with Chainlink to strengthen the security and reliability of its services.     Losers    VET      Quarterly performance: -39 percent      Rank by market capitalization: 36      Market capitalization: $262 million      Current price: $0.0030       VeChain's VET token fell by 39 percent in the January-March period, erasing the rise from $0.0035 to $0.0055 seen in the final quarter of 2019.      The first quarter began on a positive note, with the cryptocurrency rising 10 percent in January. The gains, however, were significantly less than the broader market, as indicated by the total market capitalization, which rose by 35 percent.      VET remained on the back foot in February, having underperformed in the first month, and took a beating in March as the broader market collapsed with the sell-off in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency hit a record low of 0.0014 on the Binance exchange on March 13 and ended the month with a 43 percent loss.      VeChain is a blockchain-enabled platform designed to enhance supply chain management processes and has a strong presence in China. The coronavirus outbreak in China in January and February and across Europe and in the U.S. in March hurt VeChain's business activity. However, no projects were canceled due to the pandemic, according to a VeChain Foundation blog post.      See also: Bitcoin’s Recent Recovery Won’t Salvage a Terrible Month for Prices      The foundation announced on March 31 about a collaboration with Shanghai Gas (Group) Co., Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shenergy Group Company Limited with registered capital of 4.2 billion renminbi ($57 million), to develop a blockchain-enabled energy project.       NEO      Quarterly performance: -20 percent      Rank by market capitalization: 22      Market capitalization: $631 million      Current price: $6.63      NEO (NEO), which fell 20 percent in the first quarter, is also based in China. The sentiment around “China's Ethereum” had turned bullish in the final three months of 2019, mainly due to President Xi Jinping’s decision to embrace blockchain technology.      The cryptocurrency rallied 14 percent in the October to December period, despite bitcoin’s 13.6 percent drop, only to surrender gains in the first quarter of 2020.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/01/as-crypto-prices-reeled-in-q1-these-coins-stood-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e06fd205062ad61781cb8f445318dcef20a0ec1f-2840x1832.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404334,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhuac,1585756805,Coinbase Pumps $1.1M USDC Into DeFi Sites Uniswap and PoolTogether,"Coinbase is putting its digital dollars where the traction is.      Announced Wednesday, Coinbase has deposited $1.1 million in USDC stablecoins into the pools powering two of the most popular decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Ethereum: Uniswap and PoolTogether. The investment comes via the USDC Bootstrap Fund, which the company launched in September 2019.      ""With USDC, we hope to provide critical infrastructure that will enable DeFi to grow and increasingly compete with existing financial products,"" Coinbase wrote in a blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance.      Uniswap is an automated market maker and PoolTogether gamifies the saving of money. DeFi platforms Compound and dYdX were the Bootstrap Fund's initial investments.      The latest move by Coinbase is a vote of confidence in DeFi at a time when the sector could certainly use it. In February, there was $1 billion worth of ether (ETH) locked in various DeFi applications, but that's down to $629 million as of this writing, according to DeFi Pulse. The sector's leading platform, MakerDAO, suffered a major crisis earlier this month when coronavirus fears crashed crypto markets (though the DeFi leader has since bounced back).      As for the Coinbase funding for Uniswap and PoolTogether, it's worth noting these aren't so much investments in either company but deposits into the underlying liquidity pools that make them work.      Uniswap    Coinbase is putting $1 million into the liquidity pool for USDC/ETH on Uniswap. When the pools are bigger, the app works better.      ""It provides a significant improvement to prices on that pool. The pool can support larger trade sizes and more volume,"" Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, told CoinDesk in an email.      Uniswap works by setting up matched pools where an ERC-20 token is paired with an equal amount of value in ETH. Users trade one token for ETH and that ETH for the other token, with the user never touching the ETH in the middle.      Increasing the amount of funds in each pool expands the bandwidth of any given ERC-20 token.      Smaller pools are easier to get out of line with the broader market. Larger pools are much less likely to, which means other apps will integrate it and ""a larger percentage of these price-sensitive trades are more likely to be executed over Uniswap compared with other liquidity sources,"" Adams wrote.      ""Uniswap is extensively used for liquidations and arbitrage in DeFi, and liquid exchanges are a critical building block to decentralized finance, "" Nemil Dalal, of Coinbase, told CoinDesk in an email.      PoolTogether    Coinbase has contributed $100,000 to the sponsored pool backing PoolTogether's USDC daily prize.      PoolTogether is pretty counterintuitive so here’s a quick recap. It's a lossless lottery. People get their lottery tickets by depositing DAI or USDC. Those tokens go into Compound, where they earn interest. Each week or each day (depending on the token), one depositor wins all the interest earned by everyone's crypto over that period.      No one ever loses their principle, and that’s the appeal (if you can stomach the opportunity cost). People can withdraw their tokens at any time and all they will lose is their shot at winning the next pool.      PoolTogether sweetens the deal with ""sponsored pools,"" where funds go into the pot without the possibility of winning the prize.      ""We do see a lot of players – especially larger ones – tracking the sponsorship,"" founder Leighton Cusack told CoinDesk. ""Since a significant portion of the prize pool is sponsored it makes a pretty big impact on the expected value and return players see.""      PoolTogether could use a boost. The daily prize in USDC is down from $45 in early March to $2 as of yesterday. That said, the whole DeFi sector is down dramatically and deposits of USDC on Compound are paying about 0.46 percent right now.",POSITIVE,ETH | USDC,ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING | UNI | USDC,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/01/coinbase-pumps-11m-usdc-into-defi-sites-uniswap-and-pooltogether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16b92d0db416ad64dd45cc76e0dc053232ee6413-1500x1089.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

AT&T's attorneys took issue with three parts of the second amended complaint and his request for millions in punitive damages, arguing they showed the plaintiff was himself mostly responsible for the SIM-swap scam – a type of phone hack involving stealing someone's mobile identity.      Filed at the federal court in the Central District of California earlier this week, AT&T's motion to dismiss asks the presiding judge dismisses Terpin's concealment and misrepresentation claims, as well as his request for punitive damages, with prejudice. If granted, it would mean Terpin could not bring the matter before the court again.      See also: 2 Arrested in Japan for Obtaining Crypto Linked to Coincheck’s $530M Hack      Terpin first accused AT&T of civil negligence in August 2018, alleging an employee had been bribed by a criminal gang to pass over control of his SIM card. Terpin claimed the mobile giant knew he was at risk of falling victim to a SIM-swap hack but did nothing to warn him or prevent an attack from taking place. He is suing AT&T for $23.8 million in compensation, as well as $200 million in punitive damages.      But AT&T argues in this week's filing that Terpin has not been able to show how the company concealed alleged flaws in its data security system or how he was misled. He has already admitted that he had not actually read the privacy policy and code of business conduct documents that he claimed had misled him.      ""Mr. Terpin all but admits that he cannot base a misrepresentation claim on written documents by AT&T, which he does not allege that he even saw or read, much less relied upon,"" reads the filing. ""He has all but conceded that his 11 misrepresentation claim should be dismissed with prejudice.""      A judge denied A&T's previous dismissal motion in February, giving Terpin 21 days to submit an amended complaint that addressed some of its deficiencies.

Guardicore Labs said Wednesday that in the last several weeks alone, the hackers had managed to infect close to 2,000 to 3,000 servers daily. As reported by Hacker News, the botnet has been dubbed ""Vollgar"" after the vollar cryptocurrency it mines alongside monero (XMR), and its ""vulgar"" way of operating.      The attack brute-forces passwords in order to access servers with poor security. Once in, it executes configuration changes allowing the hackers to run malicious commands and download malware binaries.      Entities across health care, aviation, IT, telecoms and education in China, India, South Korea, Turkey and the U.S. have all been affected, according to the report.      Also read: Alleged Mastermind of Sex Abuse Chatrooms Hid Payments With Privacy Coin Monero      The network of compromised computers was used to host all of the attackers infrastructure, with its primary command-and-control server based in China, according to Guardicore. That itself had been compromised by multiple attackers, the firm added.      To help companies find out if their servers have been infected by this attack, Guardicore has released a script on GitHub.      In other security news, ZDNet reported earlier this week that QR codes – now ubiquitous across the bitcoin industry as a mean of making it easier to make bitcoin payments – have become another attack vector.      The shockingly simple attack saw malicious actors provide a purported service allowing people to create a QR code for payments to their bitcoin addresses. However, the address inserted was the attacker's own.      Harry Denley, director of security at MyCrypto, discovered the scheme hosted on nine websites.

42383560,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wBCH,1585749600,How Financial Models Could Move Bitcoin's Price After the Halving,"Tobias Huber is a researcher at ETH Zurich. His work investigates financial bubbles, the future of money and how to accelerate innovation.      Every four years, the Bitcoin protocol halves the block reward that miners receive when they contribute a so-called “block” of transactions to the blockchain. Currently, the reward is 12.5 bitcoins per block. The next halving will occur, soon, in May 2020.      Built into the protocol to control bitcoin’s (BTC) inflation, the previous halvings have coincided with massive rallies. After the first halving, which occurred in November 2012, bitcoin’s price increased from $12 to more than $650. After the second halving in July 2016, the price accelerated to almost $20,000 in late-2017.      See also: CoinDesk Report - Bitcoin: The Halving and Why It Matters      While it’s, of course, uncertain whether the next halving will accelerate prices, the halvings seemed to have driven bitcoin’s previous hype cycles. Naturally, the next halving has generated an intense debate whether it’s already priced in or not.      A popular model that’s often evoked in these debates is the Stock-to-Flow model. It models the price of bitcoin based on the so-called “stock-to-flow ratio,” which, initially, was used to value gold and other raw materials. By relating the “stock” – i.e., the quantity issued – to the “flow” – i.e., the annual issued quantity – the model derives a prediction of a bitcoin price post-halving of $55,000 to $100,000 (which would correspond to a market cap of more than $1 trillion).      Unsurprisingly, the stock-to-flow model has attracted quite some attention after it was published in March 2019. Various attempts to falsify the model have been launched, and for bitcoin maximalists, it was another boost to their hyper-bullishness.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Now, according to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), prices are just incorporating new information. It assumes the market is sufficiently fast and responsive to converge on an equilibrium price that correctly reflects all external, or so-called exogenous information. All market-internal, or endogenous processes, in turn, are already reflected in prices. In this view, only exogenous inputs – for instance, an exchange hack, a central bank announcement, or a geopolitical event – can change investors’ anticipations and prices. Consequently, extreme events, such as bubbles or crashes, result simply from exogenous news that hasn't been factored into prices yet.      For proponents of the EMH, bitcoin’s supply schedule – which is encoded into the protocol and known since the inception of the network – constitutes endogenous information and should, accordingly, already be priced-in. And, most likely, most sophisticated market participants, such as market makers, have done so. But this doesn’t mean, the halving is fully priced-in.    Financial modeling is not a hard science like physics. The models don’t just faithfully reproduce markets; they actively transform them.    There’s robust evidence that prices move too much compared with what one would expect from the EMH. Research shows only a small fraction of price movements can be explained by relevant news releases. Such findings suggest that price dynamics are mostly driven by endogenous positive feedback mechanisms between investors’ anticipations and prices – a phenomenon George Soros has described as “market reflexivity.”      In my opinion, irrespectively of whether the stock-to-flow model is valid or not, whether one believes in the EMH or expects an epic rally that will trigger hyperbitcoinization, what’s often under-appreciated in these debates is the fundamentally reflexive nature of financial markets.      Markets, and especially bitcoin, are reflexive phenomena. There’s a positive feedback mechanism between expectations and prices: expectations affect prices, which, in turn, influence traders or investors’ expectations and behavior. It’s this self-reinforcing positive feedback loop that’s also at the core of speculative bubbles and market crashes.      See also: For Crypto Miners, Bitcoin’s Halving Could Mean a Doubling in Costs      Because of these reflexive dynamics, models can shape financial markets. Historically, there have been a few cases where a model re-oriented the market it’s supposed to model. The famous Black-Scholes options pricing model, for example, resulted in increased conformity between option price patterns and the model. That is, until the 1987 crash broke its validity. Similarly, current short-volatility strategies – which use volatility both as an input for risk-taking and a source of return – have a transformative effect on equity markets, as they result in a systemic suppression of volatility.      Financial modeling is not a hard science like physics. The models don’t just faithfully reproduce markets; they actively transform them. They become what the famous sociologist Robert K. Merton called self-fulfilling prophecies. (Ironically, Merton was the father of Robert C. Merton whose infamous hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management became itself a self- fulfilling prophecy of financial doom.)      So, bitcoin’s halving, or the predictions of models such as the stock-to-flow model, could themselves become self-fulfilling prophecies. This could result in a self-validating feedback loop of upward price acceleration. This isn’t to say that it will happen. But if enough investors and traders start to believe in them, the model and the reality might indeed start to converge.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Tobias A.

Zap founder Jack Mallers, best known for Lightning-friendly bitcoin services, just launched a desktop tipping product to complement the Strike payments app. Just like the mobile app, the tipping feature allows senders to give either bitcoin (BTC) or dollars while users receive dollars in their bank accounts.      Each Strike username is automatically given a public tipping website. Mallers works with trading desks on the backend so users only see a Venmo-like interface. Spenders can scan a QR code, the same way they would for sending fiat with a regular fintech app. Users are not even required to know what bitcoin is.      “Every Strike user is given a public domain at strike.me,” Mallers said. “We’re using Lightning for really fast online settlement of value transfers. … It’s also beneficial for privacy on the sender’s side.”      Read more: Zap’s New Product Lets Merchants Take Dollars Over Lightning Network      The Zap team, which has been experimenting with Strike since January, on-boarded two cannabis dispensaries last weekend. Johnny Kurish, general manager at Boulder's Helping Hands Herbals, said the closed beta program processed roughly $1,000 worth of purchases over the weekend.      Now the dispensary will switch to only accepting contactless Strike payments, Kurish said, an anomaly in a region where most cannabis dispensaries are “cash only” establishments. Employees at Helping Hands no longer touch customers to accept cash or cards.      “We’re really lucky to have curbside drop-offs. We check the ID through the roll-up window, deliver the cannabis to a podium in front of the car,” Kurish said. “We’re happy to reopen with an option that’s safe for our staff.”    Early traction    Eventually, Mallers said, he’d like to also allow options for debit cards so people can spend their bitcoin tips at the grocery store as fiat.      For now, the beta app for peer-to-peer transfers and its complementary website for receiving tips has more than 5,000 people on the waiting list. Mallers said he aims to open up the beta program to the public by summertime. So far, roughly 100 beta users are transacting with up to $20,000 a month.      “The point of the beta is to go at our own pace,” Mallers said.      Read more: Bitcoin Shopping Gets a Boost From Social Distancing      Just like PayPal, Zap is a traditional money transmission business, Mallers said, for customers who have bank accounts in any American state but New York.

42383530,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wBOr,1585745614,Zero Interest Rates Could Hamper the Stablecoin Business,"J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.      With the recent collapse in U.S. interest rates, the stablecoin industry is in for a rough ride. Some stablecoin issuers may have to rejig their business models over the next few months. The weakest of them may have to close shop.    If you're still not sure what stablecoins are, think of them as a new-fangled version of the classic banknote. Did you know that in Northern Ireland, banks are still allowedhttps://www.acbi.org.uk/uploads/assets/uploaded/b368d6c9-f8ae-4923-bad39749d9cb6aff.pdf to issue their own private banknotes? These notes are 100 percent redeemable for banknotes issued by the U.K.'s central bank, the Bank of England. The Irish love their private notes, and treat them exactly like state-issued cash. They are widely accepted at shops all over Northern Ireland.    See also: Hasu - USD Stablecoins Are Surging, but Zero Interest Rates Complicate Business Model      The obvious difference is that whereas a Northern Irish banknote is a paper replica of government money, a stablecoin is a digital replica issued on a blockchain. But, apart from that, they're quite similar.      To begin with, stablecoins and banknotes are both bearer instruments. They circulate from hand to hand, or wallet to wallet, without needing a centralized authority to manipulate accounting entries.      They both have an issuer. Northern Irish banknotes are put into circulation by the three note-issuing banks: Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank and Ulster Bank. Stablecoins are put into circulation by financial institutions such as Centre (which issues USD Coin, or USDC), Tether or TrustToken (which issues TrueUSD). These issuers have the task of managing the value of the tokens they issue.      Another similarity? Stablecoins and banknotes both yield 0 percent.      This 0 percent feature is important. It's a big part of how issuers like Ulster Bank and Centre make profits. Anyone who holds either a £50 Irish banknote or $50 in stablecoins is temporarily investing their wealth in the Ulster Bank or Centre. These issuers get to reinvest their customer's funds, say, by depositing them in ultra-safe government-insured accounts or buying Treasury bills. Since they don't pay any interest to their customers, Ulster Bank and Centre get to keep the entire flow of interest payments for themselves.      Seigniorage is the word we usually use to describe the profits accruing to issuers of 0 percent-yielding tokens. It's what helps keep the lights on at the various stablecoin issuers and at Northern Ireland's banks.    Zero interest, fewer profits    Stablecoin issuers have enjoyed decent seigniorage over the last few years. How much?      Here’s a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation. Most stablecoins are based on the U.S. dollar. At the end of July 2019, U.S. Treasury bill rates were at 2.5 percent. The total number of stablecoins in existence summed up to around $5 billion at the time.      Assuming the issuers invested $4 billion of their customers’ funds in T-bills and kept $1 billion in liquid no-interest accounts, that comes out to around $100 million in expected interest income at the end of July ($4 billion x 2.5 percent). But now that $100 million has evaporated to $0. Goodbye seigniorage.      We can actually get a snapshot of what it's like to be a stablecoin issuer in a 0 percent interest rate environment. Stasis, a European stablecoin concern, issues the largest euro-denominated stablecoin, EURS, with about 31 million euros in coins outstanding. Interest rates in Europe have been below zero for years.      In Stasis's last annual financial statements for the year ending December 2018, it had 0 euros in revenue. But it had to pay 15 million euros in costs. Much of this would have been the fixed costs of setting up an office, paying salaries, and audit fees. The impending collapse in stablecoin profitability is a bit of a killjoy because stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular (as Hasu pointed out in CoinDesk this week). Above is a chart showing the total amount of dollars (billions) held in the form of the six major U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins. The jump since early February, in the midst of the advancing COVID-19 pandemic, is quite remarkable.      Why the growth? Part of it is due to the huge plunge in the prices of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). People are flocking to stablecoins as a safe haven.    Some issuers may start covering their costs by introducing new fees.    There's a more subtle reason, too. Traders and large institutions do not typically deploy all of their funds into cryptocurrencies and other investments, preferring to keep some surplus cash on hand. These funds are usually parked in bank accounts and government-issued Treasury bills. That way they can at least earn some interest.      Stablecoins haven't been an ideal place for professional investors to lodge spare money since they pay a miserable 0 percent. But with the rates on bank accounts and Treasury bills plunging to zero over the last two months, the 0 percent rate on stablecoins no longer looks so bad. And so professional cryptocurrency traders and investors are more likely to keep their surpluses invested in stablecoins rather than pulling them back into a bank.      The interest rate on U.S. Treasury bills has actually fallen into negative territory, making the 0 percent rate on stablecoins look positively outstanding.    Going forward    What will stablecoin issuers do in future? That depends.      I suspect some issuers may start covering their costs by introducing new fees. Tether already requires users to pay 0.1 percent for converting tether tokens into dollars, or dollars into tokens (they must withdraw at least $100,000, so the minimum fee is $1,000). Centre, Paxos and TrustToken don't charge these fees. Earlier this week I talked to Centre’s CEO Jeremy Allaire, the largest of these issuers, and he is confident Centre will not be going down this route anytime soon.      Making wallet-to-wallet stablecoin payments is generally free. It's possible the issuers may start to implement a small transfer fee, just a few cents per transaction. Or perhaps they will set a slightly negative interest rate on stablecoin balances. Think of it as a daily account maintenance fee. However, users are likely to shun any issuer that introduces fees when there are other free options.      See also: The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus Payments      Not all stablecoin issuers will face immediate pressure. Issuers with multiple lines of business or a set of well-funded partners can rely on other profit centres to subsidize unprofitable stablecoin operations. As time passes they may be able to draw their stablecoin customers into new higher-fee services.      If none of this works, the weakest stablecoin issuers may be in trouble. With interest rates in the U.K. hovering around 5 percent during the 2000s, Northern Ireland's banknote issuers were swimming in seigniorage. But then the 2008 credit crisis hit and interest rates spent the next decade moping at 0.5 percent.      Because traditional banks have multiple lines of business, they can afford to have one line operate without profits. But only for so long. The smallest of Northern Ireland’s four private note-issuing banks, First Trust Bank, recently shut down its cash printing operations. It just didn't make sense to issue banknotes anymore.      We may see a few stablecoins issuers trying to push new fees on their customers. And we may also see the smallest of them doing the same as First Trust Bank. The surviving Northern Irish banknote issuers were lucky enough to fill the void left by the weakest. The same principle applies to the lucky stablecoin issuers that make it through this challenge.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/01/zero-interest-rates-could-hamper-the-stablecoin-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c068a77f7735be9d17077809de8c6c89c3b2197a-1342x954.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

HIVE Blockchain announced via email this week it's all set to acquire an existing 30-megawatt (MW) mining operation in Quebec from rival Canadian mining company Cryptologic for CA$4 million (around US$2.8 million).      ""The acquisition provides us with an advanced, operating Bitcoin mining facility ready to transition to next generation mining hardware with access to some of the lowest-cost electricity on the planet,"" said HIVE's interim Executive Chairman Frank Holmes.      See also: Miners Are Selling More Bitcoin Than They Are Mining      The lion's share of the purchase price will be met via a sale of 15 million of HIVE's common shares, at CA$0.20 each (US$0.14), to Cryptologic, for a total CA$3 million (US$2.1 million). The remainder will be made up through a CA$1 million ($700,000) placement.      The newly acquired mining facility, which has more than 14,000 Bitmain S9 bitcoin miners already in place, will more than double HIVE's mining capacity to roughly 50 MW. The facility is leased, but HIVE said it has plans to exercise an option that will extend the lease by an additional five years.      The news comes as HIVE, which is based in Vancouver, refocuses resources on its conventional mining operations. It's also increasing capacity at its Swedish GPU plant, which mines on ethereum, by more than 20 percent over the next two quarters.      The operator completely shut down its cloud mining facility – which pools processing power from remote data centers – in Q2 2019, after a year of operation. Holmes said at the time that rising mining difficulty made cloud-mining unprofitable.      This week's purchase agreement will mean Cryptologic will go on to own roughly 4 percent of HIVE's common stock. The price of HIVE shares, which are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, has increased 10 percent since the deal became public earlier this week.      See also: US County Extends Rule Making Bitcoin Mining Firms Invest in Renewable Energy      ""In addition, [the deal] is in line with the Company's green energy strategy as the Facility is powered entirely by renewable hydroelectricity, thereby maintaining our 100% green energy powered operations globally,"" Holmes said.

Two months before its grant to Ford, the BitMEX operator made an unconditional donation to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Initiative (MIT DCI), to finance further cryptocurrency research. The size of the donation was undisclosed, however.      See also: Top Bitcoin Developers Face Off in a Lightning-Powered Boxing Match      Ford has occasionally contributed research to BitMEX Research. In early January, he provided data showing how system updates had improved protocol performance and reduced bitcoin's potential attack surface.      HDR's original grant for Ford was set to run from July 2019 to July 2020. However, that has been replaced with the new grant that is aimed to increase transparency for the benefit of the Bitcoin community. The exchange owner insists grants are awarded no strings attached, and that it will not use funding to exert any influence over maintainers.      That said, the new grant still has a few conditions. According to a template contract the company posted on GitHub, all work produced has to be open source and must be relevant to bitcoin development as defined by ""the reasonable opinion of the Grantor [HDR].""

42383512,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wB4j,1585733419,Amended Lawsuit Against Ripple Now Offers Theory That XRP May Not Be a Security,"An amended complaint against Ripple has been filed by XRP investors in a long-running lawsuit involving allegations of breaches to U.S. securities law.      The two-year class action – which claims Ripple, a blockchain payments infrastructure firm, violated securities rules with its sales and marketing of the XRP cryptocurrency – has been refiled with additional claims to back up the case that Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, had undertaken unfair or fraudulent business practices.      The suit, with former XRP investor Bradley Sostack as lead plaintiff, was brought on behalf of all investors who purchased XRP (XRP) tokens issued and sold by Ripple. It alleges a scheme to raise hundreds of millions of dollars through sales of an unregistered security, XRP, to retail investors.      According to a court document filed on March 25 (see below), a sixth claim for relief asserts false advertising in violation of California business law. Notably, this amendment appears to see the plaintiffs hedging their original case, stating this claim is made ""under the alternative theory that XRP is not a security.""      An additional seventh claim further accuses the firm of unfair competition in violation of California law, also under the theory that XRP is not a security.      The amendments seem aimed to inject the ""alternative theory"" into the suit in case the judge rules Ripple did not issue and sell an unregistered security.      The other notable changes to the suit take aim at Ripple and Garlinghouse, citing their statements about XRP being a utility token essential for international payments and that sales are primarily to market makers.      ""However, as discussed above, more than 60 percent of XRP is owned by Ripple and none of that XRP is used for anything at all, other than to be sold in the future to invest,"" the plaintiffs claim.      It also hits out at Garlinghouse's claims that he was “very, very, very long XRP” and was ""'on the HODL side' – holding XRP for long-term gains. ""      That, the filing states, ""was false when made as throughout 2017 Garlinghouse sold millions of XRP on various cryptocurrency exchanges. Review of the XRP ledger indicates that Garlinghouse sold at least 67 million XRP in 2017 and that he sold any XRP he received from Ripple within days of such receipt.""      Plaintiffs had the option to refile amended claims under California law within 28 days of the previous ruling. U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in the Northern District of California ordered in February the suit could proceed to trial. The action could include claims filed under federal law but Judge Hamilton dismissed some claims filed under California state law, prompting the refiling.      The order followed a hearing held in mid-January between the plaintiff, Bradley Sostack and the defendant, Ripple, its XRP II subsidiary and CEO, Garlinghouse.

42383524,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9wBJp,1585728000,"GitHub Is Burying Bitcoin Code Inside an Arctic Mountain to Ride Out the Next 1,000 Years","An icy mountain in Norway’s Svalbard – an all but inhabitable Arctic archipelago covered in glaciers and inhabited by polar bears – is an unlikely safe haven for cryptocurrency code, let alone a pillar of modern-day civilization.      But it's here, 250 meters underground in a forsaken coal mine, that GitHub has chosen to store reams of open-source code. That includes Bitcoin Core, by far the most popular code implementation of bitcoin's underlying infrastructure and one of the most used repositories on GitHub.      As a part of an archiving program for safeguarding an important part of technological history, a ""snapshot"" of all this code will be copied onto film reels and stored in a steel container, all done in an effort to keep the data alive and unscathed for 1,000 years.      The team is currently getting this data ready. The official deposit into the mountain is planned for late April, a GitHub spokesperson told CoinDesk.      But, while Bitcoin Core is featured, most cryptocurrency projects stored on GitHub will also be included, including bitcoin's forward-looking Lightning Network, and the code behind other cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and dogecoin.      Organizations like the non-profit digital library Internet Archive and the future-looking cultural non-profit Long Now Foundation are backing the effort, and historians, anthropologists and other scientists are advising it.      Bitcoin and Ethereum coders are fans of the initiative. ""The more backups the merrier,"" as ethereum developer Ligi put it to CoinDesk.      ""I think it's likely that at some point in the future the electronic record will be lost. It's all pretty fragile. Preserving some things on hard copy could definitely help avoid a hole in history,"" said Wladimir van der Laan, lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core.      The archive potentially provides a way for people up to 1,000 years from now to figure out what on earth cryptocurrency was or how it evolved – if it manages to last a millennium.      ""In one sense, this is a fascinating section of financial history that we should preserve for future study,"" Avanti Chief Technology Officer and Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop said.    History's limits    While archiving cryptocurrency code could plug historical holes for historians, there are limits to what storing this information will enable.      Van der Laan pointed out that, from a software engineer's perspective, the code might not make much sense to coders hundreds of years from now.      ""As a developer, I do find the idea of a future historian trying to puzzle together our (what goes for) civilization from reams of clever hacks, spaghetti code and context-specific source code kind of amusing,"" van der Laan said.      Jason Teutsch, the founder of Ethereum infrastructure project Truebit and a computer science researcher, argued similarly: Explanations of the code should sit alongside the raw material.      ""The social, economic, regulatory and academic records depicting motivations and resources for code development may ultimately become more important than the code itself,"" he said.      As a part of the program, GitHub will store a guide to using the archive for those in a future time, including descriptions of ""most significant"" repositories to provide clearer context.      Read more: Here’s How to Inspect Bitcoin’s Next (Likely) Major Upgrade Yourself      As a developer who hosts a wiki for futurist technological ideas, Avanti’s Bishop is looking to preserve information even further into the future. In fact, Bishop is awaiting a patent for a way to store information inside of DNA. He notes that the genetic instructions guiding an organism's growth can preserve information for hundreds of thousands of years.      And while this project could help preserve some history, Bishop argues there's plenty of other important information out there that should be stored in a similar fashion.      ""Beyond GitHub, I think they need to seriously consider archiving Sci-Hub, which has over 70 million scientific articles,"" Bishop said. “It's one of the great feats of human intellect and progress, and it needs to be preserved.”      UPDATE (April. 9 02:09 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that GitHub is storing some supplementary material along with the code.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/01/github-is-burying-bitcoin-code-inside-an-arctic-mountain-to-ride-out-the-next-1000-years,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/946167acdf14d08a12552fe033eb33d54c2908e5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""You cannot have algorithmic stablecoins relying only on the crypto-assets themselves,"" Ardoino said. The entire value of the DeFi space, a mass of complicated financial products, cannot be based entirely on the value of a volatile asset class without the very real possibility it could all go up in smoke at any moment, he suggested.      MakerDAO came dangerously close to an emergency shutdown earlier this month after a sudden spike in demand for dai stablecoins and activity, as users tried to shore up undercollateralized loans, created a $4 million debt bubble.      See also: Tether Stablecoin Launches on Its Seventh Blockchain      For the DeFi space to grow and attract institutional investors, it has to leverage value elsewhere in order to properly diversify risk.      ""You can say anything you want about tether, [but] it's resilient,"" Ardoino said, adding that in his view, centralized collateral of U.S. dollars can provide a ""safe set of shoulders"" to the DeFi ecosystem.      Tether has already made its first foray into the DeFi space, announcing in early March it had partnered with ethereum-based lending protocol Aave.      Aave CEO Stani Kulechov told CoinDesk that integrating with tether, which he said was a popular fiat gateway for institutional investors via OTC desks, could also help to ""inject liquidity into the DeFi space.""      This means tether is less likely to fall from its dollar peg and can act as collateral for DeFi products with less risk that a sudden price drop sparks a surge in liquidations, he added.      See also: The DeFi ‘Flash Loan’ Attack That Changed Everything      ""We need to keep evolving,"" Ardoino said. Tether has to look to its strengths: ""If the EU launched a global stablecoin tomorrow, of course [tether] cannot compete in market cap.""      Moving into DeFi allows the stablecoin provider to adapt its volatility hedging characteristics for a brand new use case.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | USDT,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/01/tether-cto-claims-usdt-stablecoin-can-boost-defi-liquidity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0c1814c5f02df1f46da3ee9472a4644945e126d-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
