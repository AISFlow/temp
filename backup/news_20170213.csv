42399623,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjubb,1487024704,"Bitcoin's Price Battles New Resistance in Bid to Breach $1,000","Bitcoin prices continued to fluctuate around $1,000 today, as the global digital currency markets saw technical resistance around this figure.  Overall, bitcoin traded traded above $1,000 for roughly the first eight hours of the day, reaching as much as $1,007 during the session, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal.  Prices fell below $1,000 at 08:15 UTC, however, and failed to break through that level for the remainder of the day.  At the time of report, the currency was trading at $998.42, according to the BPI.  All eyes on China  According to analysts, traders remain reluctant about placing bets in the market, as concerns linger about further actions from the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank.  The digital currency has experienced significant volatility in the last several weeks, as the PBOC's decision to crack down on domestic exchanges has caused these marketplaces to announce a slew of sudden policy changes.  Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC (previously called the 'Big Three' exchanges) all announced they would impose consistent fees, cut margin trading and halt or slow deposits and withdrawals denominated in digital currency in recent days.  These continued developments have made some market participants reluctant to trade bitcoin, according to BTC VIX, community moderator for trading group Whale Club. He told CoinDesk:  ""I wouldn't hold any position for more than a few hours because the PBOC will continue to be active and exchanges certainly have more announcements over the next 30 days,"" he said.  Trader sentiment  So far, there's evidence backing this theory, as traders put in a large number sell orders around the $1,000 price point. This resistance was confirmed by both order book data and the input of market analysts.  Exchanges Bitfinexhttps://www.bfxdata.com/orderbooks/btcusd and Kraken showed the number of sell orders exceeding the number of buy orders close to the $1,000 mark.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, weighed in on this development:  ""Bitcoin is definitely encountering technical resistance. $1,000 is a level that is going to take some time to break.""  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, offered similar input.  ""The $1,000 level is indeed a strong psychological resistance. Bitcoin will need to cleanly break above $1,000 (high-volume rise and sustained price action above 1000) to transform that level into price support,"" he continued.  Still, he added that there are potential bullish catalysts, citing the March approval of a Bitcoin ETF or positive regulatory news from China as two possible boons.

42399614,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuSk,1487013583,Canadian Think Tank Proposes 3 Priorities for Blockchain Policy,"Non-profit think tank CD Howe has published new research in which it offers a possible roadmap for Canada's policymakers as they consider ways to regulate blockchain.  Released earlier this month, the report asserts that blockchain and distributed ledger tech will be unlikely to replace entire incumbent industries. Rather, it posits that the tech will offer the opportunity for incumbents to modernize their infrastructure.  Perhaps most notably, however, the report outlines three suggestions, advising policymakers to design a ""principle-based regulation regime"", ensure the technology achieves ""end-user cost efficiencies"", and determine the role for government as a facilitator or direct operator of blockchain-based platforms.  The report ultimately shies away from offering any firm directive, though it clarifies what it believes the choices are for traditional financial market administrators.  CD Howe writes:  ""In determining this balance, policymakers and regulators will have to decide whether to design rules and regulations along a principle-based methodology like was done with the Internet in the 1990s or whether to operate on a case-by-case basis.""  Further, it argues for a need to develop further trust among the broader market before blockchain sees wider adoption within Canada.  ""Any new blockchain technology application also will have to first build up trust among its potential users,"" the report's authors state.  Additional concerns listed include whether blockchains can adjust to dynamically meet the needs of users and whether the replication of costs that come with some existing consensus mechanisms can be solved with creative approaches.  The report comes amid an uptick in interest in interest from governments and regulators around the world. Canada's central bank in particular has been experimenting with the tech, developing a test platform for payments.

42399611,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuNp,1487007346,Hedge Funds Are Reportedly Racing to Buy Mt Gox Creditor Claims,"International hedge funds are said to be moving to purchase claims held by customers of failed bitcoin exchange startup Mt Gox.  The Financial Times reported this morning that as many as four hedge funds are moving to buy claims related to the Japan-based bitcoin firm, seeking a possible windfall should creditors be made whole.  Documents obtained by CoinDesk indicate that Argo Partners, a New York-based firm that focuses specifically on investing in failing or bankrupt companies, is among those seeking to purchase claims.  Argo Partners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  That hedge funds would be interested in the claims of Gox customers is perhaps unsurprising.  The process of unwinding the exchange, which collapsed in early 2014, is likely to drag on for years given the slow progress in the creditor process as well as the pending trial of Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, who was released on bail last July.  There's also a wide pool of potential claims sellers to pursue. Creditors have claimed hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding claims since the exchange entered bankruptcy.  Should global hedge funds become involved in the process, it would offer a new twist on an industry-defining narrative.  Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by trade volume, collapsed dramatically following months of growing operational problems. Karpeles was arrested on suspicion of fabricating volume data and was later charged with embezzlement.  The demise of Gox set the stage for much of the regulatory response to bitcoin in the years since, particularly in Japan, which has moved to bring the country’s bitcoin exchange ecosystem under existing financial statutes. Japanese lawmakers have cited Gox’s failure as a key driver in the regulatory push.

42399617,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuXf,1487006952,"JP Morgan, Santander Said to Join New Ethereum Blockchain Group","New details have emerged about a soon-to-be-launched initiative focused on enterprise uses of the ethereum protocol.  Dubbed Enterprise Ethereum, the project's founding membership is said to include major financial institutions, tech giants and natural resources companies. According to sources, participating firms include JP Morgan, CME Group, BNY Mellon, Banco Santander, Microsoft, Red Hat, Cisco, Wipro and British Petroleum, among others.  Blockchain startups BlockApps, Brainbot Technologies, ConsenSys, Nuco and Tendermint – as well as the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that oversees its code creation – are also said to be involved.  Many of the companies on the list above have already worked with ethereum, such as JPMorgan, which has developed several projects based on that codebase. Notably, Enterprise Ethereum appears to include both existing and former stakeholders in the R3 blockchain consortium.  The initiative is perhaps the most significant to date in terms of enterprise interest and the scale of development being discussed. It also signals a deepening of interest among financial firms in the ethereum platform, albeit one focused in part on implementations that are separate yet compatible with the public ethereum network.  What's more, sources say that members plan to work on initiatives that would relate to both the public ethereum network as well as permissioned or private version.  More companies are expected to join the effort, sources suggest.  Coming updates  First reported  by CoinDesk last month, the goal of the effort is to create a developmental foundation for working on ethereum implementations outside of the main public network. (Enterprise Ethereum is described as more of a technology standard than a specific network or product).  Representatives for Accenture, Brainbot, BlockApps, JPMorgan and Red Hat declined to comment.  ""There will be an announcement in the near future,"" BlockApps' James Moreau said.  When reached, a BNY Mellon representative also indicated that some kind of announcement is forthcoming.  ""BNY Mellon is taking a number of steps to use distributed ledger technology. We continue to explore and participate in various initiatives some that we may be announcing in the near future,"" the representative told CoinDesk.  While in development, Enterprise Ethereum's supporters are said to be planning to create a non-profit entity.  Further, it is said Enterprise Ethereum will be based on a membership model, incorporating working groups focused on governance, technical development and industry collaboration.

42399612,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuPn,1486992653,"Blockchain is 5 Years From Mainstream, Post-Trade Consortium Members Say","Nearly half of the members of a blockchain consortium focused on post-trade settlement see the technology achieving wider adoption over the next three to five years.  That's according to the results of a survey published today by the Post-Trade Distributed Ledger (PTDL) Group. The survey was conducted last autumn and polled its 45-strong membership.  According to the group, 48% of participants said that they see a three-to-five-year timeline for broader industry adoption. And while 29% estimate a shorter time scale (one to two years), the remaining 21% say they expect it could take five years at the very least.  The PTDL Group was launched in November 2015, backed initially by firms like the London Stock Exchange, CME Group, Euroclear, LCH.Clearnet, as well as banks Société Générale and UBS. Its membership has since grown.  When asked about the overall important of blockchain to their companies, 20% of members indicated that the tech was 'very high', with another 34% reporting that it is a ""high' priority. The tech is a 'low' priority for the other 7%, according to the survey.  Jörn Tobias, a managing director for State Street, which is a party to the PTDL Group, said in a statement:  “The survey shows that blockchain could become mainstream in just a couple of years, with benefits such as better transparency, shorter settlement cycles and cost savings clearly identified by our members. The big barrier to growth, however, is seen as caution: fears over adoption and hesitation about embracing what remains cutting-edge technology.”  The survey also focused on potential benefits applicable to the post-trade space. Of those, operational cost saving was highlighted the most among group members, with 81% of respondents ranking it as the most beneficial.

42399616,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuTj,1486990847,Deutsche Bank Analyst: Blockchain Could Have Prevented Soros Leaks,"Regulators aren't the only ones who might benefit by moving global financial transactions to a shared, unchangeable ledger, according to one Deutsche Bank analyst.  Investors, too, could be made more secure.  Case in point: last month, Dutch financial regulator AFM briefly, accidentally published private records of short trades going back four years. Among the valuable data about how leading investors were betting against companies, were a number of decisions by legendary investor George Soros.  Had the trading data been stored on a blockchain, however, the leak likely would have never happened, according to the analyst, Jamal Simpson.  Simpson told CoinDesk:  ""That was a case where ... distributed ledger technology or blockchain technology could have actually stopped that event from happening in the first place.""  As a result of the mistake (which briefly published hundreds of short sells that are required to be reported, but are visible only to the regulator), that information was made public, leading to potentially valuable insight into the investing decisions of a number of investors, including Soros.  While the regulator was quick to remove the data, the potential damage was already done. Among the shorts revealed were bets against multiple Dutch banks and the positions of Renaissance Technologies’ exclusive Medallion fund.  To give an idea of the potential value of Soros' investing decisions, Forbes estimates the US investor currently has a net worth of $25.2bn.  ""I’m pretty sure, if anyone’s gotten wind of that now,"" said Simpson, sharing his personal views. ""They’re able to build a better picture of who owns what, who owns which share, and may be able to trade or move very strategically against positions like that.""  The potential of moving financial transactions to a shared distributed ledger has been frequently discussed by members of the industry who advocate for the creation of so-called 'regulatory nodes' that could give government agencies real-time access to data.  But Simpson’s comments reveal the potential benefits of the tech to investors, too. Effectively, putting the information on a blockchain could have minimized the chance of a leak by protecting the data in transit.  Concerns over the safety of moving financial transactions to a shared ledger are common among institutions exploring the technology. But Simpson says the Soros leaks reveal the risk inherent in the current system.  Increased control  Simpson was also quick to point out that such public disclosures as are required by law could also be automated. For example, last June, Soros himself also shorted Deutsche Bank in the fallout surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union.  In that instance, Soros' investment was over the minimum amount required to demand public disclosure, another example of how both investor protections and disclosure requirements could be encoded into self-executing contracts on a blockchain.  To skeptics of the potential of blockchain tech in financial transactions, Simpson said:  ""There is more than one way to secure information, even if you’re not using blockchain technology. But what I would say is if you’re going to be using blockchain technology then it’s definitely possible. It’s technically possible to make it more secure.""

42399626,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjudZ,1486989049,Blockchain Venture Test Will Have to Wait With Mainstreet Launch Delay,"One of bitcoin's first evangelists will need to wait a little longer before launching a so-called initial coin offering (ICO).  That story, which began last year with the announcement of Mainstreet Investment LP, was supposed to take another step forward today. That's when the fund, the latest venture from former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem and his new company Intellisys Capital, was slated to open to most global investors.  Though this date has now been delayed over larger uncertainties in the crypto markets, the launch may soon mark a milestone, pairing the sometimes controversial blockchain token sale business model with one of the industry's most high-profile faces.  On a larger scale, the idea behind token sales is to harness the same power that spurred the global development of bitcoin, only this time investors would create digitally unique tokens that represent interests in companies, funds or ventures. The tokens are then used to incentivize users to participate in an investment vehicle or software product.  In the case of Mainstreet, it is touting its token sale as the first to feature a token that would both function as a security and be backed by real assets.  Even before today's sudden change, though, the limited target market, the notoriety of ICOs, their high potential for fraud, and the involvement of Shrem, have given the launch an air of excitement and suspense.  Still, according to Shrem and Jason Granger, CEO of Intellisys Capital, the idea for MIT comes on the heels of last year's uptick in global token sales, meaning that, to them, the time is right for the model to be taken more seriously.  ""I personally saw a lot of eagerness in the crypto world to invest,"" Shrem, who serves as technology chief for Intellisys, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""I thought, why we couldn't offer the crypto world a secured asset? Then, we could go out to purchase companies.""  Rethinking investment vehicles  Shrem and Granger's idea is to offer a diversified portfolio of companies across various industries and market sectors.  At time of launch, MIT will offer an asset on the ethereum network with a token cap of 50 million and a maximum revenue cap of $25m. Investors would have 100% of the preferred interests in the fund and 50% of the fund’s future profits.  The sale itself would be conducted in bitcoins, which would be converted to ether for the sake of the fund. Distributions from the fund would be made directly to investors' accounts via smart contracts.  Once $1.5m has been accumulated, the fund will secure its first purchase: a yet-to-be disclosed sanitation company based in Michigan.  The second-largest provider of portable restroom rental in its service area, the septic pumping company is thought by Intellisys to be poised for growth due to its influence with both the septic industry and the state government.  Intellisys' prospectus for the company sale reads:  ""The sanitary waste industry has remained relatively untouched by larger private equity and institutional investors, so the opportunity for consolidation is significant to the business acquisition plan.""  Limited markets  Yet, the name of the prospective buy is currently redacted by Intellisys to protect the interests of the parties involved. (Shrem and Granger told CoinDesk that they are currently drawing up a shortlist of companies that the fund is interested in acquiring.)  This list would consist 35% middle-market, real estate and 'fund-of-funds' acquisitions, 25% future middle-market investments and up to 30% bitcoin and blockchain projects. Ten percent of the fund will be dedicated to operations.  Other questions remain, such as how the fund will be received by regulators, who have been largely silent on token sales.  It's worth noting that the project got a notable boost last week when it announced it would open to EU investors, a market that it previously dismissed as presenting too big a regulatory burden.  Before Friday, participation in the ICO was restricted from Western markets, and it remains barred in the US. This is despite the fact that the fund seeks to invest in American middle-market Midwestern companies.  Granger told CoinDesk:  ""We've extensively reviewed the international investment landscape to shield the Mainstreet token offering from a multitude of unknowns.""  ICO controversies  While this sounds good on paper, this token sale model has drawn criticism due to the perception that many are ill-conceived ideas or plain-old scams.  There is even the issue with the term 'ICO' and its obvious similarity to initial public offering (IPO) – a term that creates an expectation of regulatory requirements, and perhaps, oversight.  An IPO, for example, requires up to six months of filings in order to be effective. A company seeking to hold an IPO in the US, for example, will need to file a registration statement with FINRA, the SEC and the state authority for the company’s registered locale.  A token sale, however, currently has no regulatory requirements (and there's a lot of debate about whether it should).  While there have been successful ICOs – ethereum being a notable example – the number of frauds are hard to ignore.  ""A number of crowdsales for cryptocurrencies have turned out to be outright scams, where people promised the launch of a new cryptocurrency but never made good on the promise, absconding with the funds collected during the process,"" said Veredictum.io CEO Tim Lea, adding:  ""The community as a whole, therefore, has become increasingly cautious and wary of new coins.""  Questions remain  MIT’s experimental status has also raised questions about the nature of the prospectus offered.  For example, the only two named members of Intellisys to hold non-advisory or non-marketing roles in Mainstreet are Granger and Shrem, with the former currently being the sole voting interest in the company.  In addition, while the prospectus went into detail about how the invested companies will be underwritten and secured, there was little discussion about the seeming legal and logistic contradiction about the company’s stated position and the realities of its offerings.  For example, not registering in the US as an 'investment company', as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, and actively seeking investors while seeking to secure US-based financial securities – such as the 'fund-of-funds' the company indicated it is interested in investing in – creates ambiguity that may doom the fund in the future.  This is compounded by the refusal to sell the fund to US customers, which can be construed as a means to avoid regulatory liability. Carried interest, or private equity shared interest, cannot be traded under most conditions in the US.  The memorandum specifically points out that knowledge and adherence to applicable laws regarding the local legality of being involved in the fund is the sole responsibility of the investor.  Trust issues  If trust is the key consideration in determining the investment-worthiness of a token sale, then we must also face the biggest metaphorical elephant in the room.  As stated previously, there are only two officials publicly stated to be attached to this project in non-advisor or marketing roles. One is Jason Granger, who is well established in the real estate and private equity sectors.  The other is Charlie Shrem. This would be his first venture since the shutdown of BitInstant on anti-money laundering charges and his release from prison following the subsequent sentencing.  Shrem founded BitInstant in 2011 as a way to improve the bitcoin purchasing and selling process. BitInstant offered over 700,000 locations, allowing users to quickly buy and sell bitcoins from the exchanges by means of temporary credit.  However, Shrem later plead guilty in 2015 on the charge of dealing with Robert Faiella, who supplied $1m in bitcoins to people seeking to buy drugs on the now-seized dark-web site Silk Road.  In a later blog post, Shrem said, ""I don’t look for sympathy, I did the crime and I will do the time. They say those who stand by you in the bad times, deserve to be with you in the good times.""  Shrem was jailed for 16 months, and is currently serving out three years of supervised release.  ICO advantages  Still, many who defend the ICO model are optimistic that Shrem will be able to provide it with added visibility.  ""ICOs are a good idea for the number of reasons,” said, Alex Fork, CEO of the Humaniq Project, a next-generation bank built on the ethereum network. ""ICOs give an opportunity to the people who believe in the success of the project to take part immediately with any sum they can afford.”  Fork, however, pointed out that mechanisms such as escrows, smart contracts and advising attorneys cannot be counted on to ensure the integrity of a coin or token offering.  One of the biggest issues he sees is the limitations of the technology needed to deliver the high-tech offerings.  Fork ended with an appeal to the community in this regard, adding:  ""In the absence of a better means to guarantee the safety of an ICO, the publicity of company’s key holders – who are open to the public and ready to be in touch with the community – must serve as a reliability guarantee.""

42427359,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1eLh,1486988101,Forex Giants Trading Bitcoin? In Japan That Might Be Months Away,"""It's going to be a big game changer. It's made way for all these big institutions.""  Makoto Takemiya doesn't have to go far to find someone who agrees that Japan's financial giants will soon start to push startups out of the country’s cryptocurrency market. In fact, the CEO of blockchain identity startup Soramitsu is sitting across from Mike Kayamori, the CEO of bitcoin exchange Quoine, who is already shifting his company from the consumer market for this reason.  Go Takahashi, HAW International's director, and Hitoshi Kakizawa, head of blockchain at Deloitte's Japan subsidiary, Tohmatsu Venture Support, agree, asserting that when new legislation becomes law later this year, Japan's blockchain market will see a radical change.  In spite of their varied business models and approaches to the technology, the four delegates, in New York as part of a government-sponsored innovation exchange program, find rare agreement on the issue.  Takemiya, himself a member of the Hyperledger blockchain consortium, believes that ""big financial institutions"" are lining up to add a new asset class to their existing product offers.  He told CoinDesk:  ""You’re going to have huge financial institutions competing with shitcoin exchanges.""  Kayamori, whose exchange raised $16m in a funding round last year, doesn’t agree with the choice of words, but he's just as certain this transition will begin to take place in April. That's when a law passed in Japan last May – which will require exchanges to register with the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) – will go into force, and digital currencies will become regulated.  When that happens, according to Kayamori, major foreign exchange (FX) players including GMO Internet, SBI Holdings, Monex and Hirose Financial will all seek to launch services that help boost customer activity via new product offerings.  Some, like GMO and SBI, are already positioning publicly for the move.  ""They're going to put bitcoin, ethereum and ripple, they just haven’t decided who they are going to outsource to, or who their liquidity partners will be,"" he said.  Others at the table all agree that, despite the increasing focus on enterprise blockchain and distributed ledger applications, movement on cryptocurrency will be a beachhead in Japan.  ""They want to get the new business,"" Kakizawa said. ""They want more currency.""  Market diversity  Yet despite this agreement (and the common ground of being notable players in a small industry), the startups selected for the exchange program have varied approaches to blockchain tech.  Kayamori, for instance, was there to meet exchanges including Paxos’s itBit and the Winklevoss-backed Gemini exchange, along with market makers and hedge funds. Yet others had newer business models.  On the other end of the spectrum, Takahashi noted that HAW International (itself an 18-year-old IT services firm) is looking to conduct proofs-of-concept projects with financial institutions, encouraging them to explore how traditional assets could trade on public blockchains.  ""These take three days of settlement, but on the blockchain this kind of program takes 10 minutes,"" he said.  Interestingly, Takahashi favors the bitcoin blockchain for his work with institutions, praising its simple scripting language as an asset, even as interest migrates to platforms like ethereum. (A concept that was greeted with skepticism by other attendees, some meeting for the first time).  By contrast, Tohmatsu, Kakizawa said, was there to observe and learn, so that it can keep tabs on the growing market as a value-add for its service offerings.  The delegation itself is part of a 55-strong startup group, of which 13 were sent to New York. All are there to meet business contacts and better understand how their products might fit into the world market.  Leaving the Wild West  Yet, while the changes ahead are expected to create new pressures, all agreed that they will improve Japan’s cryptocurrency market.  Kakizawa, for instance, excitedly draws his cellphone at one point to show how his news feed has been bombarded with 'sagicoin'-related content – that's Japanese slang for ‘shitcoins’, or cryptocurrencies that don’t have a unique or valuable market proposition.  Takemiya agrees with the sentiment, throwing in a personal example of why he believes the local market needs to be reined in order to protect consumers.  ""Near my house there’s a shared cafe where we can go and work, and a person next to me was trying to sell this old women on something called 'securecoin'. And he’s talking about how the Japanese yen is doomed and has all this government debt,"" he said.  ""Which makes sense,"" Kayamori added in jest, though he said the enterprise market isn’t likely to be the Wild West consumers see currently.  ""That’s going to change, after these financial companies come in,"" he continued.  Yet, there are signs this transition may be plagued by familiar roadblocks.  Toward the end of the meeting, Kayamori encourages Takemiya to apply his blockchain-based know-your-customer platform to the market, but he's not sure it’s the right move.  ""We don’t want to be so associated with cryptocurrency,"" Takemiya said.  Kayamori isn’t easily swayed, concluding:  ""As long as it touches fiat, it’s going to get regulated.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  The concept of using blockchain technology to retool the hedge fund industry is gaining traction.  At least that's the message conveyed in a report CoinDesk published last week on Melonport. The startup’s idea is to counter the high costs and onerous requirements of hedge funds, and make it easier to set up and manage portfolios.  Melonport is not alone. Several companies are taking a run at this space, from a range of angles. Some focus on the underlying platform; others focus on the returns, offering access to a managed selection of digital assets. Most seem to regard the hedge fund industry as their target.  But, I would argue the real target is elsewhere.  On the surface, blockchains and hedge funds seem made for each other. Setting up a hedge fund is expensive, not just because of the upfront legal and administrative costs, but also because of the amount of money needed to break even ($300m is considered 'small').  Furthermore, that amount is increasing, as rising regulatory costs, pressure on fees and lackluster performance are encouraging a consolidation of the industry. Times are tough – the first three quarters of 2016 saw the highest number of closures since 2008.  However, on a blockchain platform, the costs would be lower due to enhanced transparency, smoother data flows, efficiencies in custodianship and more automated compliance.  And the assets currently available, with their 'alternative' structures and relatively high risk profiles, seem to be right up a hedge fund manager’s alley: digitized representations of real-world assets, cryptocurrencies with no tangible value, digital 'coins' promising a share in future dividends, tokens granting holders access to a service, derivatives based on any of the above.  Yet while the proposals may make sense, it’s unlikely that this new type of hedge fund management will make a dent in its target sector.  Although consolidating, the hedge fund industry is still huge: approximately $3tn under management. With US President Donald Trump vowing to reduce financial industry regulations, managers have reason to be more cheerful. And hedge funds tend to love turbulent and inefficient markets.  Joining forces  Rather than fear the potential competition, it’s more likely that hedge funds will incorporate blockchain technology into their operations, improving the sector’s outlook even more.  That’s hardly 'taking on' the sector.  Where the blockchain asset management startups will make a difference is in another field entirely: venture capital.  Much has been written on initial coin offerings (ICOs) as an increasingly popular funding method for new companies, albeit one with unregulated risks and strategic disadvantages. Instead of having to undergo stressful rounds of presentations and negotiations, often giving up decision-making freedom, blockchain businesses can issue digital tokens that either represent a future utility or a participation in the earnings of the company.  At the moment, it is not simple for venture capital firms to invest in this new type of asset. Some have invested in digital token hedge funds, but that’s not the same as vetting and backing blockchain startups.  VC angle  If the blockchain businesses working in the fund management space are able to launch solid platforms that make it easy to set up and manage a portfolio of digital assets, we could well see venture capital firms setting up their own ICO funds.  This would allow them to participate in this new funding trend, while still capitalizing on their expertise and vision.  In the process, they would add liquidity and respectability to a young asset class, while actually participating in the innovation and technological progress that they profess to actively seek.  In summary, the hedge fund industry will probably end up being supported by the blockchain.  But its overall structure and purpose are unlikely to change. Where we will see a greater impact, in processes and objectives, is in venture capital. This in turn could end up stimulating a new breed of startup, and encourage the growth of a new asset class that manages to both harness and promote the technology.
