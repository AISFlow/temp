42421666,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovMb,1645055921,Why Bitcoin Is a Tool for Social Justice,"Sure, you may know the statistics.  While typical stock market investors are white men, 44 percent of Bitcoin and crypto investors are non-white. Similarly, studies have shown Black and Latino Americans now outpace white Americans in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investing.  But too many are writing off this emerging trend as just another sign of the times, another signal of a GameStop investing culture gone awry – it isn’t. Rather, Bitcoin’s rise in America is deeply rooted in our legacy of oppression of marginalized communities.  Black, Brown, LGBTQ, and Latino Americans are distrustful of an establishment and its systems that have failed them time and again – and are failing them now. The headlines speak for themselves. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted racial disparities in the healthcare system. The senseless deaths of Breona Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd, have sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racism.  Charlene Fadirepo is a former regulator and the founder of Guidefi, a fintech platform that connects women of color with financial experts and wealth education courses.  Professional sports teams including the WNBA, MLB, and MLS all all have postponed games in protest of racial injustice. Nearly 160 statues dedicated to the Confederacy have been taken down after being labeled as symbols of white supremacy.  These pivotal events have had an impact on Americans. We are reflecting and acknowledging the devastating injustices done to our marginalized communities and communities of color. All Americans are exploring new innovative solutions to our society’s most challenging problems.  As the co-authors of a new book on Bitcoin and America, we believe this call to action has led directly to the rise of an alternative monetary system.  We understand you may be dismissive of Bitcoin, that you may have heard that the technology is tied to white supremacy and groups seeking to spread hate and division. We reject this one-sided message, and instead want to explain why we see Bitcoin as a beacon of hope.  In the following article, excerpted from our new book, ""Bitcoin and the American Dream,"" we explain how Bitcoin can be used as a tool for social and economic justice, one that can help underserved communities increase their economic mobility by building generational wealth.  ***  Embedded in our nation’s history is a legacy of oppression, racism, and genocide.  More than ever before, age, race, gender, and sexual identity are shaping American policy, and for good reason. The U.S. is falling short in creating an economy where all citizens can build wealth regardless of background.  Elected leaders from both parties have an obligation to work toward dismantling the systems of oppression and discrimination that persist in this nation.  Social justice is an emerging part of the Bitcoin discussion. The discriminatory practices of the U.S. banking industry have been well documented. Lawsuits and fines against banks reveal a history of fraud, higher fees, and restricted access to credit that has disadvantaged all of our minority communities.  While no monetary invention can eliminate the effects of discrimination, Bitcoin offers Immigrant, Black, Brown, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ communities the promise of a fair and equitable financial system.  Our marginalized communities are already recognizing the potential of Bitcoin. Over 30% of Black and 27% of Latino investors own Bitcoin.  Innovations like Bitcoin ATMs allow these communities to access Bitcoin. Applications make buying, saving, and investing in Bitcoin easier.  For those who have struggled to gain access to banking services, Bitcoin is a breath of fresh air. Bitcoin wallets are software, meaning these devices cannot discriminate against users based on their identity, race, or past financial status.  This should prove of interest to progressives who have long been sensitive to issues of inequality in America.  Closing the Black Wealth Gap  For generations, Black Americans have been systemically prohibited from building wealth and ensuring property rights, and they inherit a legacy of disadvantage that impacts their finances today.  The institution of brutal chattel slavery, in which humans were valued as property, was America’s first economic system. It turned our country into a financial powerhouse, creating millionaire slave owners whose White descendents enjoy these gains.  Even after the U.S. Civil War, Black Americans would have property seized under Jim Crow-era laws that confiscated over 12 million acres.  Decades later, the New Deal would create the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which remains the foundation of our modern real estate market. This new mortgage market offered White American families a path to wealth through homeownership, but this American Dream was again not available to Black families.  The Civil Rights Act of 1968 attempted to outlaw housing discrimination. But our credit system continued to marginalize Black Americans who lived in lower-income neighborhoods deemed geographically undesirable.  Despite well-meaning past policy efforts, expensive social programs, and a progressive agenda, the Black Wealth Gap remains wide. As of 2019, median wealth for Black households in the U.S. was $24,100, compared with $189,100 for White households.  This is an imbalance created by centuries of property rights violations and thefts that have left Black Americans distrustful.  For Black Americans, Bitcoin offers the promise of a fair financial system untainted by America’s legacy of racial oppression, and strong assurances to the property rights they have long been denied. Because Bitcoin can be self-custodied, Black Americans no longer need to solely depend on banks, institutions, or intermediaries.  Bitcoin allows Black Americans to take direct agency, control, and custody of their financial assets, and the opportunity to build generational wealth.  Supporting Latino Communities  Like Black Americans, our Latino communities have historically experienced economic injustice that has hindered them from achieving the American Dream.  Leading up to the 2008 Financial Crisis, Latino borrowers were disproportionately offered costlier subprime mortgage loans. Thousands of Latino families lost homes, setting them back in their efforts to build generational wealth and savings.  These devastating financial losses coupled with past discriminatory practices from banks have fueled a distrust of the finance industry in the Latino community. Perhaps this is why 27% of these Americans use Bitcoin as a store of value.  The COVID-19 pandemic exposed more economic disparities for the Latino community. Stanford University found that Latino business owners had their Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans approved at half the rate of White-owned businesses.  Bitcoin empowers the Latino community with access to a fair economic system and offers a path to prosperity through enhanced financial tools.  Empowering First Generation Immigrants  America is a country built by immigrants, and immigrants remain a cornerstone of our economy. Of the country’s nearly 5 million business owners, 900,000 are immigrants.  The reason for this is that first-generation Americans are often breadwinners for family members abroad. America accounts for nearly 24% of all remittance transactions.  Unfortunately, remittance services are expensive. The U.S. is among the least costly countries from which to send remittances, yet the average fee is 6% per transaction.  Many immigrants are adopting Bitcoin as a way to avoid these fees. With Bitcoin, immigrants can convert dollars to Bitcoin and send Bitcoin to family members abroad.  Fees on the Bitcoin network are often much cheaper. Sending $1,000 abroad on the Bitcoin network costs about $4 on average compared to $60 when using a traditional remittance service. Lightning wallets, an emerging technology running on top of Bitcoin, take this a step further with average fees of less than 1 cent.  These savings add up. Unlike remittance services, Bitcoin operates 24/7 and settles in about 10 minutes. Armed with this tool, first generation immigrants can keep more of what they earn when they use Bitcoin.  Including LGBTQ+ Americans  One in four LGBTQ+ Americans report financial challenges based on their orientation or gender identity, and they are less likely to have a savings or retirement account.  LGBTQ+ families typically include at least one non-biological parent and many state laws make estate planning especially tricky. Should an unmarried LGBTQ+ American die without a will, courts may not recognize the custody of their children.  Perhaps because of these issues, one-quarter of LGBTQ+ Americans own Bitcoin.  Bitcoin offers the LGBTQ+ community the opportunity to transfer money to beneficiaries instead of relying on shifting state-based legislation. The ability to own and custody Bitcoin offers this and many other tangible benefits.  Domestic Violence Survivors  One out of four American women will experience some type of gender-based violence, and the vast majority of domestic abuse survivors will be subject to financial abuse. The domestic abuser may take loans in the victim’s name without consent, force agreements with financial documents, or control how the victim spends money.  As a result, survivors of domestic violence often suffer from poor credit history and a lack of resources even after they escape abusive relationships.  Bitcoin offers a path for survivors. The 2020 book “Cypherpunk Women” offered one detailed account by a domestic abuse survivor who used Bitcoin to help save in a way that went undetected by their abuser.  Bitcoin empowered this individual by offering the tools for financial independence. The domestic violence survivor was able to build wealth outside of traditional bank accounts, and outside their abuser’s control.  Conclusion  Bitcoin has opened an escape hatch for a generation of marginalized Americans and made them excited about saving and investing.  But poor regulation could force Bitcoin services to resemble our legacy financial system. As of writing, U.S. Bitcoin exchanges require users to meet the same requirements as banks. Their users must have bank accounts or debit cards, and they must rigorously collect customer information, undermining benefits for marginalized groups.  We believe Bitcoin must be a part of future education curriculums so all communities can prosper in the next generation.

A number of major altcoins rose over the same period, although ether dropped slightly.  The crypto markets' tenacity suggest there will not be another January-like dip soon.  ""Bitcoin continues to look very healthy after weathering the geopolitical storm well before benefiting from the improvement in risk appetite on Tuesday,"" wrote Craig Erlam, senior market analyst, U.K. & EMEA for Oanda.  At the time of publication, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at $44,147, down slightly. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at $3,149 and was also down slight over the past 24 hours.  Still, investors continued to look warily at Russia's next military moves along the Ukraine border and at the latest inflationary news. The U.S. Federal Reserve is continuing to track rising inflation, according to minutes from its January meeting, and is widely expected to raise interest rates several times this year. The trickle-down from rising prices is likely to affect consumer spending in the months ahead.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average were roughly flat for the trading day, while the S&P 500 rose slightly.  ""Risk appetite remains important, especially that linked to inflation and interest rates, which could continue to be a drag if anxiety remains in the broader markets,"" Erlam wrote.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Rangebound; Initial Support at $40K, Resistance at $46K  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading in a tight range between $43,000 and $44,000 over the past 24 hours. Support is nearby, which could limit pullbacks over the short term.  Buyers will need to maintain a price floor above $40,000 to sustain the uptrend from $36,000 that occurred on Feb. 3. Intraday charts appear overbought, however, which could stall the upside, similar to what occurred last week.  For now, the 50-day moving average on the four-hour chart has flattened, indicating a pause in upside momentum. Resistance remains at $46,000, and if buyers fail to maintain current levels, a dip toward $35,000 seems likely.

42416698,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulX8ah,1645049787,Nvidia’s Crypto Mining Chip Sales Continue to Fall Sharply,"Chipmaker Nvidia’s (NVDA) Cryptocurrency Mining Processors (CMP) revenue fell to $24 million in its fiscal fourth quarter ending Jan. 30, a 77% decline from $105 million in the previous quarter, according to its filings.  Nvidia announced the introduction of crypto-specific CMPs in February of last year as a way of protecting sales of its flagship GPUs for gamers.  In the second quarter of last year, Nvidia said its CMP unit generated revenue of $266 million.  The company noted on Wednesday that while its regular GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining, it has limited visibility into how much mining impacts its overall GPU demand.  Last year, Nvidia introduced hashrate limiters for its flagship GeForce GPUs to keep more products available for gamers.  In a recent conference hosted by a Wall Street investment bank Needham, Nvidia said that almost all of its Ampere-based products will incorporate a hashrate limiter to deter crypto miners from using those products for mining.  Meanwhile, Nvidia’s rival Intel (INTC) launched its own crypto mining-specific chips earlier this month, noting that mining firms Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Griid Infrastructure, as well as Jack Dorsey-led Block (SQ), will receive the chipmaker's first mining chips later this year.  Nvidia’s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.32, beating the consensus analyst estimate of $1.23, according to FactSet data. Its quarterly revenue of $7.64 billion also beat estimates of $7.42 billion.

Bitcoin (BTC) held above $43,000 on Wednesday, which means the January sell-off is starting to stabilize. Meanwhile, some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), such as AVAX, MANA and GRT, rose as much as 7% over the past 24 hours.  Tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to linger, which could keep some traders on the sidelines. On Wednesday, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) officials stated that diplomacy could continue, but so far there are no signs of de-escalation on the ground.  On the macro front, minutes from the January U.S. Federal Reserve meeting showed that officials are monitoring the higher-than-expected inflation that could trigger rate hikes. Still, the potential for higher rates is already reflected in market prices, especially after a three-day losing streak in speculative assets including stocks and cryptocurrencies.  Despite the recent price bounce, some analysts remain cautious, especially as market indicators show neutral sentiment among traders.  ""In the event BTC gets under $41,575, this postpones the rally, allowing for pullbacks to $38,734, or $37,711,"" Mark Newton, technical strategist at FundStrat, wrote in a Wednesday email.  If current price levels hold, Newton expects buying to continue toward $51,000 BTC, which is a 50% retracement of the downtrend since November.

Less buying pressure  The chart below shows the ratio of BTC buy versus sell volume in perpetual swap trades (smoothed using a 14-day moving average in yellow). A perpetual swap is a type of crypto derivative trading product, similar to traditional futures.  The ratio is currently positive, which indicates bullish sentiment. Over the past two weeks, however, buy volume has decreased relative to sell volume, suggesting low conviction among bullish traders.  Bitcoin traders remain hesitant ahead of a potential rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve in March, according to Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock. ""Data shows that this recent rally was driven mostly by futures, while spot has been selling,"" Sotiriou wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  ""We know this because the aggregated cumulative volume data (CVD) for spot BTC has been stagnant while the CVD for futures has increased. This suggests that this price rise was driven by speculation or hedging rather than genuine demand.""

42421673,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovSn,1645044880,"Bitcoin Isn't an Inflation Hedge Yet, but Here's How It Could Be","Last week, inflation data for the month of January was reported for the United States: The U.S. dollar lost 7.5% of its purchasing power compared to one year earlier, the biggest drop in 40 years. While this is not a good situation for the U.S. economy, one might have predicted this would be a moment of vindication for bitcoin holders. But it’s not panning out that way.  Since inflation really started to tick up in the spring of 2021, bitcoin has lost 18% of its value relative to the dollar, underperforming other risk assets like the S&P 500 stock index (up 8%) and traditional inflation hedges like gold (up 7%). Both bitcoin and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index are down 8% so far in 2022, while gold has rallied 3%.  Jill Gunter, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.  Bitcoin, despite its fixed supply and the popular “store of value” thesis, continues to trade with high volatility and tighter correlation with relatively risky assets like stocks versus traditional safe havens like gold. It is not inflation per se driving this price action, though. It is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s signaled response to inflation: hiking interest rates over the course of this year to mop up some of the excess liquidity in the economy, strengthen the dollar once more, and get inflation under control.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Why Is Bitcoin Dropping if It’s an ‘Inflation Hedge’?  The market’s movements and the backdrop of interest rate increases is reminiscent of the last quarter of 2018, the last time the Federal Reserve went through a hiking cycle. Over that period, bitcoin (as well as the crypto market as a whole) lost 40% of its value, while the S&P 500 retraced its gains on the year and dropped 14%. The manic highs of the prior year, 2017, were at least partially attributable to the amount of easy money that the Federal Reserve and other central banks globally had pumped into the economy. Risk assets as a whole, from high-beta tech stocks to emerging markets debt, were beneficiaries of all this liquidity – and bitcoin and the rest of the nascent crypto industry had caught that same bid.  I wrote at the time about the wild investments that people were making in the economic context of too much money sloshing around: All the way out on the risk spectrum were tokens associated with “[initial coin offerings] into which investors [had] dumped an estimated $20 billion … often with little in the way of investor rights or protections.” I cannot help but think that number sounds quaint now, both in the context of the valuations that many of those ICO-related projects have ballooned into and also in the context of investors in 2021 and the first month of 2022 having traded more than $30 billion in JPEGs. Some of this volume is of course wash-trading, and of course I am aware these are not actually “just JPEGs.” But still, talk about “risk on.”  The mania of the last couple of years far outstripped what we saw during the 2017 hype cycle. The increase in dollars that have been printed into existence has been absolutely unprecedented since the global coronavirus pandemic took hold: Annual growth of the money supply, which ranged from 3%-7% between 2015 and 2020, spiked to 20-30% in the months following March 2020.  The mania was predictable, the inflation was predictable and now the rate hikes and the drawdowns on risk assets (including bitcoin) are predictable, too. If 2018 is anything to go on, we could be looking at declines in asset values that double (or more) from here. The magnitude and duration of the declines are hard to foresee and will be dependent on whether the Federal Reserve can guide the economy to a soft landing from its current state, flying too close to the sun.  With bitcoin as of yet failing to fulfill its promise of serving as an inflation hedge, it is worth reflecting on what needs to happen in order for it to start trading as such.  How bitcoin becomes a genuine store-of-value  Perhaps the most foundational shift that needs to occur in order for bitcoin to behave as a store of value is the market needs to mature. A mature market is characterized by long-term investors who can afford to weather volatility and price drops – and can even take the other side of these trades, lending support and stability to the asset. Often these investors are institutional investors, but I would argue they do not necessarily need to be big traditional banks and asset managers, though those would not hurt. More and more crypto-dedicated funds are in position to be able to serve as these stabilizing forces in the market.  Another hallmark of market maturity is the development of common frameworks, metrics and classifications used across market participants. There are certain heuristics that investors and traders develop over time to rapidly understand, consider, and trade assets. Even the notion of a risk spectrum is an example of this. With risky tech stocks and emerging market assets at one end and with gold and U.S. Treasury bonds as the safe-haven assets at the other end. Investors and traders share an understanding of asset class categorizations and how those categories are broadly expected to trade in various market conditions. There is a recursiveness to the market. Investors expect gold to go higher when inflation ticks up, and so it does!  Today, crypto assets are not yet disambiguated with any sophistication by market participants. In the context of macro markets, bitcoin, ether, ADA, SOL and AVAX are all lumped together. For traders and investors who spend all day on crypto, this is of course not the case, but just watch the next time any mainstream financial news outlet covers crypto. Only rarely are these and other tokens broken out as different categories or classes. For bitcoin to stop trading like a risk asset and start trading as an inflation hedge, it needs to be viewed as a separate asset class from the rest of the crypto markets.  There are signs this is starting to happen, with the likes of Goldman Sachs publishing research separating bitcoin from the others and deeming it a “store of value” to compete with gold. Of course, it will take more than narrative and a few research notes to get there. As the crypto market matures toward mainstream finance, the large investors and traders will need to align not only on classifications but also on the parameters that determine those categories, enabling a more nuanced perspective on bitcoin as well as other crypto assets.  Just as stocks have price-to-earnings and other ratios the markets have coalesced around in order to evaluate them and commodities have their specific supply and demand dynamics, so, too, should the market align on common metrics that matter when it comes to the various categories of crypto assets. Some of these metrics have already emerged and just need to be more widely adopted and viewed as a signal in the context of macro markets.  Some examples of these benchmarks include: inflation rate of the crypto asset; eventual fixed supply (in the case of bitcoin); implied 2030 market cap; and “coin days destroyed” or the number of days a given asset has been dormant in a wallet. These standards exist. They just have not become salient enough and pervasive enough amongst all the major market participants. That there is no clear standard view or categorization for bitcoin is well demonstrated by Goldman itself. Only six months prior to its latest piece on bitcoin as a store of value, it put out a note stating: “We view gold as a defensive inflation hedge and crypto as a risk-on inflation hedge,” failing to call out bitcoin as a possible exception.  The big bitcoin inflation hedge thesis is finally being put to the test in the United States, and it is not faring well so far. As the crypto markets continue to mature and as market participants begin to differentiate bitcoin from the multitude of other crypto assets out there, there is reason to believe that it can still fulfill its promise as a store of value. Market maturity, common valuation frameworks and shared narratives take time to develop, however, so you might not want to put all of your money on bitcoin to hedge the devaluing U.S. dollar just yet.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Jill Gunter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/16/bitcoin-isnt-an-inflation-hedge-yet-but-heres-how-it-could-be,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0807d05d12c3e02574d9ba2a6901b06876590fda-2022x1482.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416685,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulX81O,1645044878,Gold-Backed Tokens Grow Despite Mixed Reviews From Analysts,"Gold-backed tokens are outpacing the overall growth of the crypto market, despite some analysts' concerns about the reliability of the tokens as well as the very wisdom of investing in the yellow metal.  The market capitalization of tether gold (XAUT), the largest gold-backed stablecoin, has increased fourfold since the start of January 2021 to $421.3 million, according to CoinGecko. The second-biggest gold-backed stablecoin, PAX gold (PAXG), has grown fivefold to $378.3 million.  On a combined basis, the market cap of the two tokens has increased 360%, versus 150% for all cryptocurrencies, according to the analysis firm Arcane Research.  “Many investors are looking to get involved with the volatile crypto asset class, and gold-backed tokens provide some protection against volatility,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda. “Gold-backed tokens could continue to see massive appeal as gold’s outlook for the year improves.”  Gold is seen by many investors in traditional financial markets as a hedge against inflation – similar to the way that many traders in crypto markets think that bitcoin might increase in value if the dollar's purchasing power erodes.  Gold as store of value  Some investors also argue that gold might be a safe haven in times of geopolitical turmoil, so the recent tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine have added to the appeal for bullion. These tensions have been cited as a driver for a $1.6 billion flow into the world’s largest gold fund at the end of January.  The price of gold is up 2.8% in the past month, trading at $1,849.71 per ounce, gaining while stocks fell. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 0.6% during the same period.  Analysts said that recent data showing inflation at the fastest pace in four decades is providing some support for gold.  The economic and market environment might be fueling a surge in interest in gold tokens among crypto traders.  “Commodity-backed tokens are growing in popularity,"" Arcane wrote on Feb. 8. ""So far, primarily gold-backed tokens have attracted investment, but other commodities may soon follow.” The Russian nickel and palladium giant Nornickel was approved on Feb. 3 by the Central Bank of Russia to issue commodity-backed tokens through its subsidiary Atomyze.  Since the gold tokens are tied to the price of the yellow metal, the rising market capitalization really just represents an increase in the number of tokens outstanding, analysts said.  ""What you are talking about is that there is issuance of gold-backed tokens,"" said Mati Greenspan, CEO at Quantum Economics and former eToro senior analyst. ""If they want to issue them, they issue them.""  The market value of the gold tokens, now around $800 million combined, pales in comparison with bitcoin's $833 billion.  And, of course, the price action on gold in recent years has been anemic compared with many cryptocurrencies whose prices have gone up by many multiples.  “For investors, there’s little profit for gold-backed tokens as the price does not change much,” Greenspan said.  Supply, demand and 'digital scarcity'  With gold and gold tokens, when the price goes up, gold miners can try to dig up more and increase supply. Bitcoin's supply, by contrast, is controlled by the underlying blockchain's original programming. When the price goes up, the supply growth stays the same.  “When it comes to valuation of digital assets, it seems that digital scarcity in and of itself is far more powerful than the added benefits of tying it to a metal or other physical materials,” Greenspan said.  Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com and a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, said gold-backed tokens bring advantages, such as fast settlement, zero minimum purchases and high transferability.  The redemption process isn't always so smooth, though: Sometimes it can take days or weeks, he said.  Greenspan noted that investors may need to trust that the issuers of the gold-backed tokens are actually buying gold to back them up.  The Arcane report pointed out that several projects have tried creating tokens backed by commodities other than gold, such as silver or palladium, but have met various obstacles along the way. One silver-backed token offering has been marked as a scam.  A big question hanging over dollar-backed stablecoins such as Tether's USDT is whether it has proper reserves to back up those tokens.  Tether, the largest dollar-linked stablecoin, has a market capitalization of $78.6 billion, according to CoinGecko. But its issuer, Tether, has been the subject of skepticism over the reserves it uses to back USDT.  “Just because somebody said to you they are offering you gold-backed tokens doesn’t mean that you can actually trust them that they are actually backed by physical gold,” Greenspan said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Angelique Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/16/gold-backed-tokens-grow-despite-mixed-reviews-from-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72be438a58f5b1577f640f581232d5df6cb83dec-640x480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421677,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovXx,1645043738,What Web 3 Can Learn From 3D TV,"I often get the sense that outside of the crypto industry most people are still skeptical about all the things grouped under the “Web 3” brand. More than skeptical, sometimes, but also downright antagonistic.  Yesterday, Jared Holt, the Atlantic Council's resident expert on domestic extremism and digital culture, and the brains behind the “SH!TPOST” Substack newsletter and podcast, tweeted the hope that American consumers would band together to reject next-gen, crypto-based web technologies.  “It is my sincere hope that we can come together enough to forcibly reject [Web 3] as the hyper-commodified disease that it is,” Holt said.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Strong words from Holt, a reporter turned talking head. I don’t know much about Holt’s politics, other than he has built a brand covering right-wing extremism and misinformation, but if they veer anywhere close to his employer’s it’s the establishment norm.  The Atlantic Council pushes the “neoliberal” line, a word that, like “Web 3,” is often used but lacks a coherent definition. Essentially, neoliberalism is the mainstream political posture in the U.S. – the pro-markets, anti-regulation, strain of capitalism that took hold after Lyndon Johnson’s push for a “Great Society.”  Neoliberalism is about consumer choice, so long as mega-corporations are in the position to present those choices. It’s about austere public-private partnerships rather than expansive government-provided services or purely competition-derived solutions. And, perhaps ironically for Holt, in fetishing privatization it leads to commodification.  As always, it’s worth asking “cui bono?” Who benefits from crypto? Earlier this year, bitcoin advocate Jack Dorsey suggested “crypto” markets have already been cornered by venture capitalists and other major crypto investors. That’s not a question Holt raised; he questioned the very idea of technological progress.  “There’s always this talk about growth and development as if it’s innately good. That framing needs to be aggressively questioned. ‘Growth’ can be bad,” Holt added. We already live with a high degree of technological sophistication and convenience – like the smart phones in our pocket, he said. When is enough enough?  Read more: What Jack Dorsey’s Beef With 'Web 3' Is Really About  Web 3, still in development, wants to give power, influence and monetary rewards to regular internet users. It does this, by and large, by decentralizing the internet stack and adding tradable crypto tokens. Instead of top-down corporations shipping products, token holders would have influence over a platform’s management and share in its upside. It’s “commodification,” adding another element of monetization to the web, but for a purpose.  Web 3’s solutions may not ultimately be desirable, but it seems like an experiment worth undertaking. Someone who studies disinformation ought to know how contemporary economic models play a hand in boosting extreme voices for engagement. Such maladjusted behavior may not be the case when advertising is no longer the end goal for internet platforms, or when users have an explicit economic stake (something to lose) tied to their identities.  Consumer resistance  In a reply to Holt, Bellingcat investigative reporter Robert Evans said, “We killed 3D TVs. We can kill this,” referring to Web 3. It’s an illustrative example.  According to Livewire, 3D TV became television’s “next big thing” after the success of James Cameron’s 2009 film “Avatar” – in what’s now called the “Avatar effect.” Big entertainment studios and manufacturers started preparing for a world of embodied televisual experiences. But the trend was dead on arrival.  It was a combination of expensive equipment (goggles, remotes, etc.), the number of consumers upgrading to HDTVs and reports the holograms created caused nausea that killed 3D TV. Most importantly, there was a lack of genuine demand. Samsung and Sony stopped releasing 3D tech in 2016, according to Livewire.  This might be a trend “metaverse” builders should study, but it also has bearing for Web 3. It’s already an issue that people like Evans and Holt, and likely average Joes, see Web 3 as something being forced on them. There may be benefits, maybe even better consumer experiences, but it still appears like a trend that’s mostly coming from the top down.  Read more: How Do You Know Crypto Is Winning? Look Where the Talent Is Going  Despite the fact that Andreessen Horowitz is leading a “Web 3” charge to get governments to support (or at least not regulate out of existence) crypto development, there’s no group or agency that can make this shift happen. Web 3 is neoliberal in the sense that it’s all about open markets, about competition at the protocol level and private solutions.

42421672,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovPh,1645043431,Bitcoin’s 'Energy Problem' Is Overblown,"Bitcoin has many noisy and powerful critics. First, Bitcoin was a scam; now the bitcoin (BTC) currency is one of the national currencies of El Salvador. Then it facilitated illegal activity, even though cash still remains a criminal’s best friend. Now they say it’s an environmental scourge, another weak argument made by a small yet noisy minority.  Ultimately, emissions are caused by burning fossil fuels. We don’t ban cars because of their emissions, we power them with cleaner sources of energy. The same trend toward cleaner electricity production is happening with Bitcoin. Many love to hate Bitcoin, but their reasons are starting to run dry.  Bobby Lee is the founder and CEO of Ballet, a cryptocurrency wallet company, and author of the Wall Street Journal bestseller ""The Promise of Bitcoin.""  Today, the most widely trafficked piece of disinformation about Bitcoin is the idea that it is contributing disproportionately to the current global environmental catastrophe. Sincere public concern about climate change and environmental protection are being exploited by those, like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, who are deeply entrenched in the old financial system.  The Bitcoin-induced climate change hypothesis appears coherent on the surface. Computers require electricity to run. Bitcoin is a globally decentralized network of thousands of computers so it, therefore, consumes a large amount of electricity. As (BTC) becomes more valuable, the amount of electricity consumed to secure the network is expected to increase proportionally.  A better energy data comparison  However, critics, like Professor Brian Lucey at Trinity College Dublin, go on to point out that “[b]itcoin alone consumes the same amount of energy as a medium-sized country. … It’s a dirty business, it’s a dirty currency.”  But these arguments are supported by cherry-picked data and misleading comparisons. Research from Digiconomist suggests the energy consumption for one Bitcoin transaction is the same as for 453,000 Visa transactions.  However, we must remember that credit card payments still rely on existing, emission-heavy infrastructures like the ACH, Fedwire and SWIFT, as well as the military and diplomatic strength of the U.S. government. The critics don’t include those emissions in their calculations comparing Bitcoin and the traditional banking system. It’s like comparing the emissions of the entire coffee industry with a single cafe.  Indeed, once we factor in these overhead emissions, a different reality emerges. Recent research from Galaxy Digital reveals that Bitcoin consumes approximately 113.89 terawatt-hours per year, whereas the banking industry consumes approximately 263.72 TWh per year, which is more than double.  We must instead consider the environmental footprint of the banking system that Bitcoin is set to replace. Modern banking consumes massive amounts of electricity to support thousands of commercial office buildings and local branches, millions of employees’ daily commute and billions of customers who have to travel to and from physical bank locations for service. Bitcoin will greatly reduce the demand for traditional banking services, thus eliminating most of that industry’s environmental impact.  Bitcoin consumes a huge amount of electricity, but we must look at the energy sources in order to fully understand the situation. A recent survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council found that 56% of Bitcoin’s electricity consumption comes from clean (zero carbon emissions) sources of such energy, which is a higher rate than any other major industry. For comparison, only 40% of electricity in the United States is generated from clean energy sources.  Bitcoin’s fundamentally different vision  However, in the atmosphere of climate fatalism, environmental arguments will always hold sway over the less informed. Once people can be convinced their existence is threatened by Bitcoin, they will feel they have no choice but to stay trapped in the fiat system.  Bitcoin offers a fundamentally different vision. Its deflationary value encourages people to save for the long term instead of spending in the short. In essence, the shelf life of capital under the Bitcoin system is far, far longer.  BTC's price has increased over 100% per year on average, and strong growth is projected to continue for many more. Bitcoin imposes a huge opportunity cost on wasteful consumption. People have less incentive to buy the latest consumer product when their capital isn’t constantly being eaten by inflation. Buying an iPhone today makes less sense when those funds will be worth more tomorrow.  Small, voluntary changes in individual behaviors such as these would be compounded across the whole of society, and the aggregate impact would be transformational. It’s not necessary to sacrifice freedom and prosperity to protect the environment.  Bitcoin’s critics will continue to scrape the bottom of the barrel for new arguments against this revolutionary technology. While stoking climate fears is the latest rhetorical tool used by crypto-phobes, we should remember that, just like their other half-baked arguments, the climate objection fails to stand up to basic scrutiny.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | RESEARCH,Bobby Lee,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/16/bitcoins-energy-problem-is-overblown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad7073179f4abcdee5c0d0fee55ec4a2835b8244-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Castle Island Ventures III fund is the largest fund ever for Castle Island since it was founded in 2018, following its first $30 million fund and then a $50 million second fund that closed in February 2021. Investors in the third fund included endowments, asset managers, family offices and fund of fund groups, according to the announcement post on Medium.  The Castle Island portfolio of early-stage crypto investments has included asset management firm Bitwise and crypto lender BlockFi.  The new fund will continue Castle Island’s investments at the “convergence of blockchains and the more regulated financial services market,” said Carter, a CoinDesk columnist, in a phone call. “That’s going to remain a big component. Anything from brokerage to custody to exchanges to lenders and banks.”  “Of late, we’ve also become much more active in Web 3, whether that’s internet infrastructure or decentralized applications that allow people to interact with the internet without relying on the Silicon Valley oligopolies,” Carter continued.  Castle Island also said it promoted Ria Bhutoria, another Fidelity alum, to general partner, joining Carter, Walsh and Sean Judge.  Equity focused  Carter said Castle Island Ventures differs from other funds in its equity investment approach, which can prove attractive to potential limited partners (LP) who are interested in crypto but more familiar with equity as opposed to token sales.  For potential portfolio companies, the firm offers deep connections to the asset management and financial services world, a benefit for those wanting to become more integrated with traditional finance.  Cryptocurrencies pulled back at the start of the year, but the lower prices and trading volumes haven’t discouraged venture capitalists from making investments.  Carter acknowledged that the deployment window exposes the firm to “what’s happening in terms of valuations,” but Castle Island Venture has a history of launching in choppy waters.  “When we launched our first fund in early 2018, it was an amazing time to deploy. There was a prolonged bear market. The founders we met were the ones that cared very deeply about this stuff. And the valuations were modest at the time,” said Carter.  “A sell-off would make sense for us. I don’t want anyone to lose money. But from the perspective of being an allocator, the froth coming out of the market a little bit would be pretty welcome,” Carter noted.

But, unfortunately, this technology has certain issues and the wrapped tokens they use. Portal wants to change that narrative by removing the need for wrapped assets or third-party custody of user assets. Cross-Chain Bridges Are A Security Risk Those are the findings of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, uttered last month. There is a good reason why Buterin uses harsh language, as cross-chain bridges are prone to 51% attacks. When such an attack occurs, hackers and other culprits control the system and can defraud users. Although a 51% attack is not a permanent problem, attackers&apos; possibility to steal funds needs to be nipped in the bud. These bridges wrap and lock funds on other chains to facilitate transfers in their current form. It is an elegant solution, although one that introduces unnecessary security concerns. More specifically, the wrapping and locking aspect isn&apos;t decentralized or trustless. Additionally, that approach can lead to security incidents, such as the ones affecting MultiChain, THORChain, pNetwork, Poly Network, and others. Staghead Crypto Head Neil Player adds: &apos;Cross chain bridges present a unique set of security risks and these types of exploits are not a surprise.

Blige, Kendrick Lamar and Eminem.  Snoop Dogg is more than familiar with the NFT scene. In September, he claimed to have started a personal NFT collection now worth more than $17 million under the name Cozomo de’ Medici, although the claim has never been confirmed.  The rapper also just released an NFT collection with Gala Games on Feb. 9 for the launch of his new album, “Bacc on Death Row.” The “Stash Box” NFTs have already grossed more than $50 million in sales, with holders being given an NFT of one of the album’s songs.

The federal police agencies, working with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), are investigating cryptocurrency donations supporting the weeks-long protest against Canada’s vaccine mandate. The protests are now deemed illegal under the Emergencies Act invoked by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the first time since the law was passed in 1988.  The truck drivers began their protest near the end of January against international travel restrictions imposed by the Canadian government, which requires all entrants to the country to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The truckers blocked international bridges and border crossings in several Canadian provinces.  The list consists of 29 Bitcoin addresses, one Ethereum address, one Cardano address, one Ethereum Classic address, one Litecoin address and one Monero address, according to the order. A copy of the order was circulating on Twitter earlier on Wednesday. CoinDesk confirmed its authenticity.  Donors have sent more than 20 BTC to the addresses, worth over $870,000 (CA$1.1 million). The donors turned to cryptocurrencies after the GoFundMe account that had previously received more than $9 million was suspended.  The Emergencies Act was set to take aim at protester finances. Speaking alongside Trudeau, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said banks can immediately freeze or suspend bank accounts tied to the truckers without a court order and without fear of civil liability.  As part of the Emergencies Act, Canada is broadening the scope the country's anti-money laundering/anti-terrorist financing rules, which will now include crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers such as PayPal and Stripe and will include digital assets such as crypto, used by suspected individuals and companies, RCMP Spokesperson told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  ""All crowd funding platforms and the payment service providers they use now must register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), and must report large and suspicious transactions to FINTRAC,"" spokesperson said. ""As the situation is new and quickly evolving, the RCMP is not in position to offer further information on crowdfunding through cryptocurrency at this time.""

Created keeping the community&apos;s requirements in mind, these smart contracts simplify the creation of yield generating products like permissionless fixed return staking programs and more. Introduction of these permissionless advanced smart contracts is a result of EasyFi&apos;s effort to plug a long-existing gap between the user requirement and the availability of yield generating products in the DeFi market.

The Fixed Interest Staking feature is quite opposite to EasyFi&apos;s another recently launched product - Flexi-Interest Program where the interest yield varies with change in the target pool of tokens. Instead, the returns in fixed interest staking are directly proportional to their share of deposits in the specific target pool. It is a welcome addition to those who prefer stability over flexibility, as they can expect to receive a committed yield for a pre-specified duration without relying on the token pool status at any instant.

The filings themselves are in the names of L’Oréal’s subsidiaries, including makeup and cosmetic companies Kiehl’s, Maybelline, Pureology, Urban Decay and Redken, among others.  The Kiehl’s filing includes rights to “non-downloadable virtual perfumery,” along with “hair care preparations and cosmetic body care preparations in a virtual environment including a metaverse.”  In eight of the filings, L’Oréal stakes claim to “providing a metaverse for people to browse, accumulate, buy, sell and trade virtual cosmetics.”  L’Oréal did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on its filings by the time of publication.  The company’s initial foray into NFTs came back in December, when it released a collection of seven NFTs focused on female artists and their empowerment. The collection was ultimately a flop, however, seeing less than 0.5 ETH (around $1,550) in sales volume to date.  While the concept of virtual perfume in a metaverse environment may be difficult to grasp, filing a trademark for such things is no longer unusual.  Companies ranging from McDonald’s to Walmart have recently filed for NFT-related trademarks, as have celebrities including Logan Paul, Bronny James and the late Kobe Bryant.

42421711,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovTp,1645025713,"ETHDenver Day 2: NFTs, Gaming the Future and COVID Fantasists","Like any really happening conference, ETHDenver is impossible to experience in full. It’s hard to even really tell when it begins and ends. Events have been going on for roughly a week, but the official kickoff day is Thursday.  So first, for those of you about to arrive, a crucial and practical tip – get to registration as early as possible for your badge. The conference is requiring on-site COVID-19 tests for entry (though not proof of vaccination), and even with the small trickle of people showing up early on Tuesday, things got snarled. I expect huge and frustrating delays today and tomorrow as the bulk of attendees show up.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. He will be at ETHDenver all week.  Inevitably, there was a COVID-19 fantasist on hand to make things even more annoying. (Pro tip for the big brains: Yelling at the guy manning the registration table about the testing policy demonstrates you have a brick wall’s comprehension of how the world works. When you’re a white-presenting male shouting at an indifferent, harried and non-white staffer that the policy is “segregation,” some might draw even darker conclusions about your character.)  Anyway, the testing process is being handled in groups, which provides a nice chance to talk to a random sample of other attendees. As expected, this is the first crypto conference for quite a few of them. I bumped into folks who had been drawn into crypto by dog tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and it’s great to see that pipeline leading to an event as hardcore as ETHDenver.  Some presenters catered to the newbie audience. “Who knows what a fork is?” one asked from the stage yesterday. “OK, lots of you, not everyone.” That anyone would be at a high-level crypto conference without knowing what a fork is is pretty crazy, but also hopeful – the presenter went on to give a decent, concise explanation, so there’s real learning happening here.  See also: ETHDenver Agenda: 3 Big Themes in 2022  The most interesting presentation I caught Tuesday was from the Foresight Institute, a nonprofit focused on using technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) and biotech to solve big problems. This group has been around for decades, but it's stepping into crypto because of its potential to coordinate action to, in particular, fund public goods. The institute has a new collection of interesting essays called ""Gaming the Future"" about, broadly, incentive design, that seems fascinating and features crypto big wheels including Balaji Srinivasan.  This explicit call to use blockchain tech to solve big collective action problems perfectly captures Ethereum’s cultural position in the cryptosphere. The clearest contrast is with Bitcoiners, who are in fact focused on a collective problem – currency management – but generally frame that in hyper-individualist terms of property and ownership. The discourse around Ethereum is substantially more hippy-dippy, invoking a blissful future in which systems design solves all of our political problems. Often that’s to a fault – we are, after all, still essentially talking about money here, and many would argue you can’t dismantle the master’s house with the master’s tools.  Finally, not a lot of today’s programming caught my eye – perhaps a bit of a lull before things get into full swing. But two events did stick out – this introduction to decentralized storage using IPFS and Filecoin, and this discussion on privacy and Web 3, a vital topic. If you’re not in Denver this week, it does appear you still have a chance to register as a virtual attendee and watch these online.  So have fun, stay safe, be nice and prepare to learn.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIL | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

The report was verified by U.K.-based standards testing firm BSI.  “A positive opinion on zero greenhouse gas emissions from an international auditor may be considered, without exaggeration, a watershed event for the industry,” BitRiver Rus CEO Igor Runets said in the press release.  The environmental impact of crypto mining has been at the center of regulatory debates in the U.S. and Europe, with some estimates putting the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption on a par with countries like Argentina.  The testing firm verified that BitRiver’s direct and indirect emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) were equal to zero, in accordance with the standard ISO 14064-1:2006. Greenhouse-gas emissions are calculated using international renewable energy certificates (I-RECs) that certify the renewable origin of electricity.  BSI did not respond to CoinDesk’s request to confirm the report at the time of publication.  Verifying BitRiver’s greenhouse gas emissions report was an “unusual project,” David Fardel, BSI’s CEO for CIS and France, said in the statement.  BitRiver Rus, based in Irkutsk, Siberia, is one of the largest mining firms in Russia, offering hosting services for large-scale mining. Its data centers are 300 megawatts, and the company plans to increase their size over sixfold by the end of 2022.

Multicoin Capital and Union Square Ventures (USV) led the 3Box equity investment. Coinbase Ventures, Metacartel, Reciprocal, CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group and many more were also among the backers.  The Web 3 product studio created Ceramic and plans to remain a key contributor to the data-minded layer 1 network after its upcoming mainnet launch, Mike Sena, co-founder of 3Box Labs, told CoinDesk. The network has been in beta since June. Sena has been working on its key idea – making data more open and accessible – since 2015. The firm spun out of Ethereum venture studio ConsenSys in June 2019.  With its biggest test yet approaching, 3Box will use the Series A funding to almost double its staff with new slots for product, engineering and community positions influential for making today’s form of Web 3 startups a success.  Sena said Ceramic has three core components: a scalable infrastructure layer for data, a clearinghouse for sharing data models between network participants and an API suite that any project can use to plug in. The idea is to make all this data more composable and accessible on a decentralized internet.  “Web 3 social” has been an early focus among teams building on the network, he said in an interview.  Beta developers have started compiling what is perhaps an early glimpse of the apps to premiere on mainnet. Estimated in the “thousands,” they’ve built basic components of decentralized social media platforms, including social graphs and reputation systems.  “Blockchains have already demonstrated the value of composability for tokens. Ceramic brings that same composability to every single piece of data on the internet,” Sena said in a statement.  Ceramic may well have its own token one day. But devs haven’t committed to that plan just yet, other than to say they’re thinking about it. If it were to launch, it would have a similar role that ether does on Ethereum, as a “gas” token that unlocks network functionality and incentivizes development.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/16/usv-multicoin-lead-30m-raise-for-3boxs-ceramic-data-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27c2860848f4d6bc130760cc8fbbb0f218d37f3f-4733x3155.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416696,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulX8UH,1645020709,Irrelevance of January Fed Minutes Shows How Fast Monetary Policy Is Moving,"With minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting due out Wednesday, crypto traders might be forgiven for dismissing them entirely.  Look how drastically the environment has changed in the past month: The January jobs report showed a much hotter labor market than expected by economists, explaining partly why last week’s Consumer Price Index report came in at a shocking 7.5%, larger than analysts predicted and the fastest pace in four decades.  The fresh data put Wall Street on high alert that conditions were becoming more urgent even than Fed Chair Jerome Powell had telegraphed at the January meeting. Global financial markets reacted by pricing in a much more aggressive rate-hiking cycle by the Federal Reserve.  'Inter-meeting rate hike'  At one point last week, speculation even mounted over a possible ""inter-meeting rate hike"" – the idea that the U.S. central bank couldn't afford to wait until its next regular meeting, scheduled for March, to start raising rates. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said in an interview that “there was a time when you would just take a situation like this and you would just meet today, off-cycle.”  Bullard’s statement crushed both stock and crypto markets, based on concerns that a more aggressive Fed could send prices for risky assets into a tailspin.  “If the Fed surprises markets, the pace of this risk-off move will accelerate, perhaps dramatically,"" said Federal Financial Analytics' managing partner Karen Petrou. “Cryptocurrency will suffer like all 'risk-off' market sectors in this scenario, but perhaps suffer worse because its volatility is so much greater.”  Fears of an inter-meeting rate hike by the Fed abated on Monday as U.S. short-term interest rate futures implied just a 3% chance of rate hikes before the next two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in March, down from 30% after Bullard’s interview, according to Reuters.  Wholesale price inflation  However, the Labor Department’s latest Producer Price Index, which was released Tuesday, showed inflation in wholesale prices at a higher clip than anticipated by economists, reinforcing the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner rather than later.  The Federal Reserve is scheduled to release minutes of its January meeting later Wednesday and some analysts have suggested that the Fed might actively seek to sell off assets – rather than simply letting the bonds roll off at maturity – to shrink the balance sheet even faster.  “We think this suggested passive reduction will be bullish for the market,” QCP Capital wrote in a message.  Nevertheless, just taking a glance at the CME’s FedWatch tool over the past month gives an idea of how much expectations about the Fed minutes have changed since the last meeting. The tool shows the implied level of future Fed rates based on prices from CME futures contracts.  Just one week ago, traders put a 74% chance on a 0.25 percentage-point rate hike in March. On Tuesday, predictions reversed, with 58% of traders now betting on a 50 basis point hike.  ""I'm not sure what we'll learn from the Fed minutes later today that we're not already aware of, with numerous policymakers expressing increasingly hawkish views in recent weeks,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Wednesday in an email.  The unkind kind of surprise  In general, the Fed doesn’t like to surprise traders, but whether a rate hike happens at next month’s policy meeting on March 16 or at a surprise meeting before, the crypto market will likely be affected negatively, according to some analysts.  “Given bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still correlating somewhat with risk sentiment, we see [a surprise hike] as having a weighing influence,” said Joel Kruger, crypto strategist at LMAX Digital. “That being said, we expect any dips in bitcoin (crypto) would be very well supported on its longer-term value proposition.”  Some analysts think of bitcoin as a hedge against inflation; however, recent market movements suggest that the volatility in the cryptocurrency market is scaring investors away. The market has been on a downward path since its series of all-time-highs in November, while inflation is still on the rise.  “It would make sense that as we enter into a rate hike cycle, some of that underlying bid will be taken back out of the market,"" Dan Gunsberg, co-founder and CEO of the Hxro Foundation, said.This seems very plausible in the short run.

Seed phrases are a series of words that give users access to the cryptocurrency in their digital wallet. The phrases usually contain 12, 18 or 24 words, leading Evervault to name its service 121824.  The 121824 service is secured by the same encryption technology that Dublin-based Evervault offers to financial and health information companies.  User data remains encrypted at all times, though it can still be processed and shared. Evervault never stores the data and developers don’t configure crypto algorithms or manage keys.  Access to 121824 costs $1 per wallet per month, or $10 per wallet per year. Users access the service through the website, which currently has the waitlist open with a full launch expected in the coming weeks.  Seed phrase security became a plot point in the headline-grabbing arrest of a couple that allegedly laundered billions of dollars in bitcoin from the 2016 Bitfinex hack.  When the arrest was announced on Feb. 8, U.S. authorities said they were able to access wallets controlled by Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan after decrypting a spreadsheet of seed phrases saved to a cloud storage service.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning. Today's newsletter was edited by Shaurya Malwa and produced by Bradley Keoun.  Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. Here's what's happening this morning:  Market Moves: This week's rally in crypto markets appeared to be cooling as skepticism grew over Russia's pullback from Ukraine.  ALSO: Algorand's ALGO token leads gains among the CoinDesk 20, and the metaverse-related tokens SAND and AXS jumped.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover,"" hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today's show will feature guests:  Lennix Lai, director of financial markets, OKX  Alex Bornyakov, deputy minister, Ukraine Ministry of Digital Transformation  Jared Polis, governor of Colorado.  Market Moves  By Shaurya Malwa  Bitcoin surged past $44,000 late Tuesday in its biggest gain in more than a week but on Wednesday appeared to be losing steam.  Crypto markets cooled as major cryptocurrencies hit resistance levels. Bitcoin faced resistance at the $44,300-$45,500 price levels, and low volume indicated weak buying strength.  Algorand's ALGO token was the biggest gainer among the CoinDesk 20 digital assets, with a 6.4% rise. Filecoin's FIL token climbed 5.2%.  Investors in traditional markets grew more cautious as Western officials expressed skepticism over a quick de-escalation of the Russia-Ukraine tensions.  Outside of major cryptocurrencies, metaverse tokens continued to surge on Wednesday. In the past 24 hours, Decentraland’s MANA was up 10.5%, The Sandbox’s SAND up 6% and Axie Infinity’s AXS up 11%. The tokens are used for blockchain-based games in separate virtual worlds broadly referred to as a “metaverse.""  Meanwhile, traders said the general outlook for cryptos remained bullish amid improving sentiment for asset classes globally.  ""After a strong rebound following January's 7.5% CPI print, cryptocurrencies have pulled back in line with traditional markets,” said Will Hamilton, head of trading at Trovio Capital Management, in an email to CoinDesk.

42396002,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0UVz,1645017468,"Bank of Russia Proceeds With Digital Ruble, Renews Push for Crypto Ban","The Bank of Russia said it started the pilot stage of the digital ruble, its planned central bank digital currency (CBDC). It must become an alternative to cryptocurrencies for Russians, the regulator has said, which should be totally banned.  Three banks are already supporting pilot transactions for their clients using existing mobile bank apps, as well as gateways to exchange rubles from their accounts for the digital version, according to an announcement published on the Bank of Russia website on Tuesday. Nine more banks are upgrading their tech stacks to join the pilot soon, the report said.  At the same time, the central bank reiterated its call for a total ban on cryptocurrencies. According to Forbes, the regulator sent its objections to cryptocurrency regulation to the Ministry of Finance, which had earlier proposed allowing regulated crypto purchases through licensed Russian banks. That approach was later detailed in a road map for cryptocurrency regulation published by the government.  In its letter, the Bank of Russia said that allowing non-qualified investors to trade cryptocurrencies through banks will create ""an illusion of government protection"" while encouraging people to participate in a ""de-facto Ponzi scheme,"" Forbes wrote. The government won't be able to fully control cryptocurrency transactions, and the crypto industry won't really benefit the Russian economy, the bank said.  The government responded to the bank's January call for a ban by publishing a road map for cryptocurrency regulation in Russia shortly afterward. The Bank of Russia was listed as a participant in discussions, however, recent statements indicate it never really agreed with the idea of legalizing crypto. Earlier this year, President Vladimir Putin called for the central bank and the government to find common ground.  The Bank of Russia plans to push for a bill to amend the 2020 digital assets law that would ban crypto issuance, trading and publishing information about such services, Forbes wrote. Banks and communications providers would have to block transactions to individuals known to be involved with cryptocurrency-related business. Financial organizations also wouldn't be allowed to own cryptocurrencies.  The Ministry of Finance, meantime, is on track to propose a bill on regulating crypto by Feb. 18, TASS news agency reported.

42396001,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0UV0,1645016587,"Crypto Heavyweights Coinbase, Fidelity and Robinhood Back US Anti-Money Laundering Group","A group of well-established firms active in cryptocurrencies in the U.S., including Coinbase, Fidelity and Robinhood, have joined together to bring digital assets in step with global anti-money laundering (AML) rules.  In total, there are some 18 virtual asset service providers (VASPs) participating in the launch of the Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST). Announced Wednesday, the TRUST platform was created in response to AML data sharing requirements recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and prescribed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  The current U.S. TRUST membership includes: Anchorage, Avanti, Bitgo, bitFlyer, Bittrex, BlockFi, Circle, Coinbase, Fidelity Digital Assets, Gemini, Kraken, Paxos, Robinhood, Standard Custody & Trust, Symbridge, Tradestation, Zero Hash and Zodia Custody.  There have been a number of proposed ways to accommodate ""travel rule"" requirements within the pseudonymous-by-design cryptocurrency space. Prior to its official launch, TRUST was known among crypto AML specialists as the U.S. Travel Rule Working Group, where the lead engineering firepower was provided by Coinbase, alongside a founding member group that included Gemini, BitGo, Kraken, Circle and Fidelity.  How it works  “There are two components to this solution,” said Gemini’s Chief Compliance Officer Elena Hughes in an interview. “There’s the ability to identify who’s on the other side of the transfer prior to initiating it. Secondly, there’s no centralized storage of personal data. So we don’t send it via a centralized repository; instead the information is exchanged on a bilateral basis.”  The plan, said Hughes, is to expand to other global jurisdictions, with building currently taking place in Canada, Singapore and Germany. The group’s goal is also to become an industry standard for complying with the travel rule. (Until now there has been only one standard agreed upon by the crypto industry, the Inter-VASP Messaging Standard, known as IVMS 101.)  Some jurisdictions, including Singapore, have chosen to go a step beyond the FATF travel rule recommendations for identifying beneficial owners of transactions between VASPs to include those with private or unhosted wallets – a point of contention among many in crypto.  With regard to the inclusion of unhosted wallets within the TRUST architecture, Hughes said: “We are working toward ensuring that we have a compliance solution in those other jurisdictions. What it will ultimately look like is going to be a bit of a ‘time will tell.’”  ‘A tool in the compliance arsenal’  The TRUST solution’s compliance capabilities will be reinforced by a partnership with Exiger, a technology platform focused on regulation and financial crime, according to a press release. The TRUST protocol could also bolster the world of blockchain analytics, those firms that follow the money in the case of nefarious actors transacting in crypto, according to Paxos Director of Compliance Christel Chan.  “I do see the TRUST travel solution as a tool in the compliance arsenal with regard to being able to give signals to VASPs as to, is this a wallet of concern?” said Chan in an interview. “And also as a complementary tool when it comes to blockchain monitoring firms’ capabilities.”  Interoperability between the range of solutions on offer (Fidelity Digital Assets is a member of both TRUST and the institution-focused Travel Rule Protocol, for example), as well as across different regions, is another hot topic in the crypto travel rule space.  “I think a year or two down the line, interoperability will be a core requirement,” Chan said. “I know the different solutions are thinking about this with regard to the various partnerships they’re discussing today.”  The concerted effort behind TRUST is an achievement in itself, given how directly competitive these firms are with one another. Robinhood Chief Operating Officer Christine Brown via an emailed statement called it “an innovative compliance solution, while also persevering the integrity of private customer data.”  “Just as it takes a community of crypto investors and enthusiasts to democratize finance, we believe it takes a community of crypto businesses and platforms to work together to find a solution to preserve customer privacy while meeting the legal requirements of the Travel Rule,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/16/crypto-heavyweights-coinbase-fidelity-and-robinhood-join-us-anti-money-laundering-group,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6610272760e0e819f8da10134cb9e123b5d4b75a-1500x796.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Ucs,1645016400,Chainalysis Says ‘Criminal Whales' Account for 4% of the Overall Pod,"The crypto industry’s “criminal whales” are making a big splash.  According to a new report from Chainalysis, criminal whales – defined as wallets containing at least $1 million worth of crypto, that have received 10% or more of their funds from illicit addresses – accounted for nearly 4% of the total number of high value wallets last year.  Kim Grauer, director of research at Chainalysis, told CoinDesk the findings were noteworthy because the presence of fewer, larger targets demonstrates the potential for law enforcement seizures and the recouping of stolen funds.  “It allows us to say ‘this is the amount of money that is seizable should [the whales] be the target of an investigation,’” Grauer said.  The report comes one week after a couple accused of laundering the proceeds of a 2016 Bitfinex hack were arrested at their New York apartment, and a crypto wallet containing $3.6 billion in bitcoin was seized by government officials.  Read more: Federal Judge Releases ‘Razzlekhan,’ Orders Other Bitfinex Hack Laundering Suspect to Remain in Jail  The seizure of funds connected to the Bitfinex hack took a massive chunk out of the estimated $11 billion worth of funds with known illicit sources held by criminals at the end of 2021.  The Bitfinex hack laundering suspects’ case mirrors much of Chainalysis’ findings about large-scale crypto criminals.  Chainalysis’ research indicates that stolen funds dominated the total of “illicit funds” held by criminals last year, accounting for a whopping 93%. Darknet market funds accounted for $448 million, scams for $192 million, fraud shops for $66 million and ransomware for just $30 million.  And, like the alleged Bitfinex launderers, Grauer said the growing balance of criminal whale wallets indicates liquidity issues.  “If you’re a criminal whale, and you’re holding a lot of money, and there’s all these groups of people who are tracing funds, I suspect you have a major liquidity problem,” Grauer said.  “Maybe you’re waiting for a technological solution that you’re comfortable with, maybe you’re just holding it until you really need to cash out, but if you’re holding large quantities of illicit funds I think you’re probably aware that you have a difficult task ahead of you if you want to convert that to fiat currency,” Grauer added.  The report also highlighted a new time zone analysis technique developed by Chainalysis that provides insight into the location of criminal whales.  According to the report, UTC time zones 2, 3 and 4 – which include major Russian cities including Moscow and St. Petersburg – are believed to contain the most criminal whales.  Grauer stressed that, while the analysis is far from conclusive (time zones only show latitude, not longitude, meaning that the criminal whales could also be in parts of Africa or the Middle East), it’s a strong indicator of Russian criminal whale activity.  “Maybe this is someone not based in Russia, who just does business with Russia,” Grauer said. “But this is genuinely a stronger signal than I was expecting to get out of the analysis.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/16/chainalysis-says-criminal-whales-account-for-4-of-the-overall-pod,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68358df99f328e2fa228732f538e9ae9361bce81-4384x2911.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The multi-year deal is “the single largest per-annum cryptocurrency venture yet seen in international sport,” the company said in a press release on Wednesday.  The deal is worth $50 million per annum over a three-year period, bringing the total to $150 million, a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  Under the agreement, Bybit will join the Oracle Red Bull team as a principal team partner, just behind the title partner IT major Oracle, according to the press release.  Bybit will also take on the role of issuing fan tokens for the Formula 1 team, helping it grow its digital assets, while supporting Bybit’s crypto education initiative.  The exchange will also be the team’s tech incubator partner, meaning it will work on a range of projects from crypto literacy to promoting green technology, the press release said.  The deal is the latest in a series of sponsorship deals between crypto companies and major international sports team. Crypto firms have been increasingly getting involved in branding and advertising, via sponsorship deals.  Singapore-based Bybit, which has 6 million users, is ranked ninth on the list of top spot crypto exchanges in the world by CoinMarketCap.

42410922,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtGiC,1645014600,Ethereum’s Rollups Aren’t All Built the Same,"Today, a week after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin doubled down on his belief in rollups, I hoped it might be useful to provide an introduction to the technology behind rollups and the different approaches used in their implementation.  So, as defined by the Ethereum Foundation, rollups are a solution for scaling Ethereum that performs transaction execution outside of the network’s layer 1, yet posts the transaction data to Ethereum and inherits its security properties. In short, rollups make Ethereum transactions cheaper without significantly sacrificing the inherent security of the base blockchain. It's important to note that not all rollups are built the same; the most popular implementations have very different security models and user experiences.  Optimistic rollups  Optimistic rollups do not do any computation by default; rather, they assume all state changes are valid (hence optimistic) and post the off-chain transactions to Ethereum’s layer 1 as calldata. In order to protect against fraudulent transactions, the rollup has dispute periods in which any third party can publish a fraud proof. The fraud proof will cross-check layer 1 and layer 2 and confirm that all transactions are valid. If not, the invalid transactions and all following affected transactions will be reverted. Arbitrum, Optimism and Metis are a few of the protocols implementing Optimistic rollup technology to create a full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment with user experience being a cheaper and faster version of mainnet.  Optimistic rollups do not largely change the trust assumptions of Ethereum, as any user is capable of running a sequencer (Arbitrum full node) that processes transactions and allows users to withdraw funds to mainnet. Sequencers are required to put up a “fidelity bond” on mainnet, thereby creating a financial incentive to be truthful. If another user disputes the sequencer’s transactions, and they are found to be dishonest, the fidelity bond is paid out to the disputer. Financial incentives and multiple sequencers will allow the layer 2s to have strong uptime performance and lean on Ethereum’s security without the concern of interference.  By socializing gas cost across bundled users and only posting calldata to mainnet, Optimistic rollups are able to achieve transaction fees 10-100x cheaper than the corresponding transaction on Ethereum layer 1. These fees will continue to get cheaper as data storage is optimized on mainnet for rollups and sharding, splitting the network in multiple chains to relieve congestion, is eventually implemented.  Zero knowledge rollups  Zero knowledge (zk) rollups bunch together hundreds of off-chain transactions using extensive computation and post them bundled to mainnet in what is known as a “validity proof.” The validity proof is the already computed state of the layer 2 that is sent to mainnet for storage, which contains much less data than the calldata used in Optimistic rollups. Starkware, Polygon Hermez and zkSync are a few of the first implementations of Ethereum based zk rollups creating low cost, application specific layer 2s.  Since zk rollups are so computationally intensive, it is nearly impossible to recreate the full EVM environment that layer 1 and Optimistic rollups are able to run. Therefore, this scaling solution is confined to single types of transactions and cannot host a wide variety of projects on a single network. However, since zk rollups compute and verify transactions on their own, the technology is able to offer fast finality and transaction costs that are significantly lower than Optimistic rollups and magnitudes lower than mainnet.  Which rollup will win?  The transition to rollups is still at an extremely early stage, with the most activity still seen on Ethereum mainnet and a handful of alternative layer 1s. Until large liquidity providers and developers decide to move capital and protocols over to rollups, it will be difficult to say which solution is favorable. Obviously it may not be a binary answer, with some applications favoring an application-specific chain and others favoring full EVM compatibility and the surrounding composability.  As of today, protocols have appeared to favor Arbitrum, which falls under the Optimistic category. Arbitrum has gained $2.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) according to DeFiLlama, making it the 10th largest individual chain. DyDx however, utilized zk rollup technology to enable leveraged derivatives products that gained massive traction earlier in 2021. The application has nearly $1 billion in TVL alone and noted that they chose Starkware’s ZK technology for its further commitment to decentralization and user experience.  ETHDenver  To get a better understanding of where Ethereum is moving next, I will be attending ETHDenver later this week!

Validated takes  LooksRare NFT marketplace is called out for a team payout, which again brings into question the longevity of decentralized protocols. BACKGROUND: The protocol’s mechanics were transparently stated in the documents, but caused backlash this week when the team received a large payout in wrapped ether. While the payout might have been unnecessarily large, the team did not sell any of the Looks token and had been working on the project unpaid for over six months.  A new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) would set the foundation for staked ether withdrawals after the transition to proof-of-stake. BACKGROUND: While the EIP won’t immediately allow validator withdrawals, it sets the stage for the simple upgrade that makes the process possible. Ethereum core developers are estimating the Merge will take place in the early summer, and this proposal would further advance the road to proof-of-stake.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury reiterated that the IRS would not classify miners, stakers or developers as “brokers” under the new Infrastructure bill. BACKGROUND: Months ago, the crypto provision seen in the infrastructure bill would have subjected miners and validators to impossible reporting requirements that could kill the U.S. crypto industry. A single senator made the move to block an informed amendment to the provision, but the department acknowledged that it would be impossible for wallet providers, stakers and miners to follow transaction reporting as brokers.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau enacted the Emergencies Act that would expand the scope of Canada’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist rules to cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use. BACKGROUND: The measure is part of a move to defend against anti-government and vaccine protests that have impacted the country’s capital and border in recent weeks. With banks and governments now having the authority to freeze and close accounts thought to be associated with funding the protests, crypto enthusiasts have pointed to the importance of the unbiased financial services and accounts Bitcoin and Ethereum could potentially provide.

However, on-chain supply of the crypto remains stable, indicating the market is ready to “ride out the storm ahead.” according to a report by on-chain data provider Glassnode.  There are no signs of a mass exit driven by fear as data shows that both spot holdings and fund flows remain stable, Glassnode said Monday.  “This speaks to a clear investor uncertainty regarding the wider economic impact of a tighter U.S. dollar, given the preceding decades of loose monetary policy,” Glassnode said.  Given an expectation of volatility due to the U.S. Federal Reserve's expected rate hike, traders are reducing their exposure to leveraged assets via a process called deleveraging.  This has resulted in what Glassnode calls a ""flattening"" of the futures term structure, meaning the estimated price of bitcoin at a future date is getting lower and lower.  Futures that expire at the end of 2022 currently have a strike price of $44,200, which represents a 6% annualized premium Glassnode calls “very modest.”  “Investors are deleveraging and utilizing derivatives markets to hedge out risk and buy downside protection, with a keen eye on the Fed rate hikes expected in March. Meanwhile, overall on-chain supply dynamics appear to be in a form of equilibrium,” Glassnode wrote.  Deleveraging is being done by traders closing positions, not a forced closure due to a liquidation cascade. Liquidation cascade occurs when the asset price experiences a steep decline resulting in long derivative positions being closed, which further lowers the price of the underlying asset.  Glassnode also notes there’s a “remarkably resilient cohort of hodlers” as the supply of bitcoin held by long-term holders continues to stay stable.

The acquisition will assist Fireblocks in expanding support for business-to-consumer payments using USDC, celo, and other stablecoins and cryptocurrencies as early as spring 2022, the companies said in a statement. The deal comes just weeks after Fireblocks raised $550 million at about an $8 billion valuation in its latest funding round..  The tie-up is a natural, said Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov, noting the two firms have been working together on various payments-related use cases since 2019.  “The acquisition of First Digital gives us the opportunity to take stablecoins and crypto payments to the mass market,” said Shaulov, speaking with CoinDesk. “It will allow all of our 900 clients – and many more that [First Digital is] bringing to the table – the ability to accept payments in stablecoins, both for business to business, but most importantly for consumers.”  At first glance, the move into consumer and cross-border payments seems like a radical change of direction for institutional-focused Fireblocks. However, the firm began widening its scope and cementing its partnership with First Digital when both were involved in the early days of Facebook’s ill-fated Libra stablecoin project, later renamed Diem.  “We started working on Libra together back in 2019; Fireblocks, from a secure wallet perspective, and First in terms of payment protocols on the blockchain,” said First Digital CEO Ran Goldi. “We think that between the PSPs [payment service providers] both companies work with, we probably have over 2 million merchants that we can serve in 2022.”  Over the last couple of years, crypto custody firms were the likely acquisition targets of banks and larger fintech companies. These days it’s players like Fireblocks, armed with sizable war chests, that are doing the shopping.  “We are looking to leverage our balance sheet, grow organically and find the best companies to merge with,” Shaulov said. “First Digital is the first of many.”",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/16/crypto-custody-firm-fireblocks-acquires-payment-tech-platform-first-digital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49b009dbccdc043058992179c3994737f4bb93ee-2470x2470.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Helsinki-based platform allows any professional asset manager or aspiring asset manager to create their own operation, CEO Ville Vesterinen explained to CoinDesk.  After users link their wallet to Housecat, they can “subscribe” to an asset manager. The manager's trades will be mirrored in the wallet, with the asset manager earning fees based on performance and the value of assets under management.  “We have built Housecat for ourselves and for everyone like us who would like to tap into the incredible financial opportunity that is crypto – but who don’t have time or the technical expertise to follow all the different projects, tokens, and investment opportunities,” Vesterinen said in a release.

42396006,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0UZv,1645011496,"Morgan Stanley Says Ethereum Less Decentralized, Ether More Volatile Compared to Bitcoin","The concentration risk on the Ethereum network is significant as most of its ether (ETH) currency is held by a small number of accounts, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management wrote in a note entitled “Cryptocurrency 201: What Is Ethereum?”  The network is less decentralized than Bitcoin, with the top 100 addresses holding 39% of ether compared to just 14% for bitcoin, analysts led by Denny Galindo wrote in the report published last month.  Ethereum currently enjoys a dominant market share in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) sectors, but this could decrease over time as challengers emerge, the report said. Prominent Ethereum competitors include Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain), Solana and Cardano.  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without using traditional middlemen. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items.  DeFi and NFTs - which constitute most of the activity on Ethereum - are subject to rapidly evolving regulations, and any new rules that restrict areas, such as finance, could see reduced demand for transactions on the network, Morgan Stanley said.  The other major Ethereum-specific risk is “blockchain bloat and scalability,” it added. As a global smart contract platform, Ethereum needs to store a huge amount of data, and the network needs to be faster and less expensive to use per transaction than its competitors, the report said.  The Ethereum network is growing faster than Bitcoin and its memory requirements have exceeded Bitcoin’s in half the time. Unless changed, its storage demand will likely outstrip its resources, the report added.  “High transaction fees create scalability problems and threaten user demand,” the analysts said, adding that high costs make the platform too expensive for small-value transactions.  Volatility is also an important risk factor for ether as it has been more volatile than bitcoin, Morgan Stanley said, adding that since 2018 ether has been about 30% more volatile than bitcoin.

42396015,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Ugo,1645009912,Avalanche’s AVAX Surges as Bitcoin Rally Stalls,"The crypto market's rally stalled on Wednesday after crypto company ads running during the Super Bowl championship football game in the U.S. spurred gains earlier in the week. Avalanche’s AVAX led gains among the biggest tokens, adding 12% in the past day.  The market has cooled since early Tuesday, when AVAX jumped as much as 13.5%, followed by Solana’s SOL token with 11% gains. That move added nearly 6% to the total crypto market capitalization, taking it above $2 trillion. Now it has hit resistance levels, with most of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market value little changed.  In the past 24 hours, ether (ETH) advanced 3%, Cardano’s ADA rose 2.1% and SOL, XRP and Binance Smart Chain’s BNB added 1.5%. The moves followed rallies in broader Asian markets amid tensions between Russia and Ukraine. South Korea’s Kospi index rose 1.99%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index 1.49% while the Euro Stoxx 50 index was little changed.  AVAX's touched $94 in early Asian hours. However, it faces resistance at the $95 level – which it failed to break in January – with relative strength index (RSI) readings suggesting a correction could soon occur. RSI is a price-chart indicator that calculates the magnitude of price changes and helps traders identify a change in trend.  Bitcoin surged past $44,000 on Tuesday night and held above that level in the European morning. However, the move occurred during low volume, indicating weak buying strength and the asset faces resistance at the $44,300 to $45,500 levels.  Outside of the majors, metaverse tokens continued to surge on Wednesday. In the past 24 hours, Decentraland’s MANA was up 10.5%, The Sandbox’s SAND 6% and Axie Infinity’s AXS 11%. The tokens are used for blockchain-based games in separate virtual worlds broadly referred to as a “metaverse.”  Gala Games’ GALA metaverse token gained 2.8% in the past 24 hours after a 20% run on Tuesday. That move came after Gala Games said it would deploy $5 billion within the next year to bolster its in-game offerings by buying intellectual property rights and building a theme park, as reported.  Traders said the general outlook for cryptos remained bullish amid improving sentiment for asset classes globally.  ""After a strong rebound following January's 7.5% CPI print, cryptocurrencies have pulled back in line with traditional markets,” said Will Hamilton, head of trading at Trovio Capital Management, in an email to CoinDesk, referring to U.S. inflation figures.  ""Whilst the market consolidates it is important to note a persistent decrease in the available supply of bitcoin and ether on exchanges,” Hamilton added, noting there was an increase in stablecoin supply held by exchanges that suggested investors were ready to pounce on opportunities for buying in the coming months.",NEUTRAL,AVAX | GALA,AVAX | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | GALA,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/16/avalanches-avax-surges-as-bitcoin-rally-stalls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81c4c776d7f1d966cbe9d272453d1915b429f7fb-1813x830.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance has secured a deal with payments group Paysafe to gain access to the Faster Payment Service, the U.K. network that allows consumers and businesses to make fast payments between financial services providers.  Users of the world's largest crypto exchange will now be able to deposit funds in their account via this service.  The FCA said that its ""concerns about Binance remain,"" though it has “limited powers to object to arrangements of this kind,"" according to the report.  “Paysafe is aware of our concerns and is subject to close ongoing supervision consistent with our approach for firms of its size,"" the FCA added.  “We take our compliance obligations very seriously and work proactively and collaboratively with regulators,” a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Binance's regulatory woes in the U.K. began last year when the FCA warned the exchange was not authorized to be operate in the country.

Especially if the movement was falling. This rule is proved by the DOT cryptocurrency. In the weekly timeframe, you can see that since mid-January, the price has clearly slowed in the range of $19. Since then, buyers have not been allowed to update local lows. The closing of the weekly candle on 7 February was an important signal for the beginning of a probable growth wave. https://www.tradingview.com/x/ny3htfiV/ As we can see, buyers did not even allow to cover the body of the previous consolidation candle. This signal was immediately used by buyers, starting a new trading week with growth. By stopping the fall near the global growth trend, buyers have shown interest in the fight. Therefore, by the end of February, we expect the formation of a new DOT growth wave with the first local target of $24 and global $31. Trading volumes in the DOT market remain low and have not yet issued plans for buyers to launch a counterattack. Technical Analysis Of DOT On The Daily Timeframe https://www.tradingview.com/x/LwTERF3B/ Analyzing the movement of the DOT price on the daily timeframe, we can see that the critical level for buyers is $18. If on the weekly timeframe you can allocate a whole range of $17-$19, then on the daily one we see a slightly narrower liquidity zone.

Having said that, China&apos;s CBDC is in the middle of a contentious climb. The 2022 Winter Olympics; also known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games, began on Feb. 4 in Beijing.

42395996,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0UQ5,1645002000,"Crypto Could Derail Financial Stability, Global Financial Watchdog Says","Fast-evolving crypto markets could be a threat to global financial stability, according to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international organization that monitors and makes recommendations for the global financial system.  In a report published Wednesday, the FSB examined potential vulnerabilities connected to unbacked crypto assets like bitcoin, stablecoins (cryptocurrencies tethered to the value of real assets) and decentralized finance (DeFi) along with crypto trading platforms.  Funded by the Bank for International Settlements, the umbrella group for central banks, the FSB is chaired by De Nederlandsche Bank President Klaas Knot.  Although the global crypto market is still relatively small and the extent of crypto use around the world varies, risks to financial stability “could rapidly escalate,” the FSB said. It emphasized the need for proactive evaluation of policy responses.  The new report comes after regulators in multiple jurisdictions including in the U.S. and U.K. reached similar conclusions. In the five years through October 2021, the cryptocurrency market capitalization grew around 200% to a record $2.7 trillion. It is currently about $2 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.  “Crypto-asset markets are fast evolving and could reach a point where they represent a threat to global financial stability due to their scale, structural vulnerabilities and increasing interconnectedness with the traditional financial system,” the report said.  Pace vs. scale  Despite the multitrillion-dollar market cap, crypto still makes up a small portion of the assets within the global financial system, according to the FSB. While connections between the crypto market and traditional financial markets are growing fast, they remain limited, the report said.  More traditional participants in global finance began paying attention to crypto during the 2021 price run, but investment has been slow to pick up. While corporations including MicroStrategy and Tesla have significant bitcoin exposure, firms such as Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan seem more cautious.  “Nevertheless, institutional involvement in crypto-asset markets, both as investors and service providers, has grown over the last year, albeit from a low base,” the report said. “If the current trajectory of growth in scale and interconnectedness of crypto-assets to these institutions were to continue, this could have implications for global financial stability.""  In October the FSB said the $133 billion global stablecoin market was still too small to be considered as a mainstream payment method. The new report suggests the rapid growth of DeFi and the stablecoins that power the sector could harm financial markets if something were to go wrong.  “Were a major stablecoin to fail, it is possible that liquidity within the broader crypto-asset ecosystem (including in DeFi) could become constrained, disrupting trading and potentially causing stress in those markets. This could also spill over to short-term funding markets if stablecoin reserve holdings were liquidated in a disorderly fashion.”  The report did not provide any recommendations other than stating the need to preemptively consider policy options for regulating the sector. It did say that it will continue to monitor and recommend effective ways to implement its guidance on global stablecoins from 2020.

Centralized exchanges take a huge amount of fees to list the tokens on their platform. However, anyone can list their token on decentralized exchanges, without paying a huge amount of fees. In this article, you will read about a decentralized exchange known as Osmosis that gives users control over their assets, low slippage while trading, and many more other benefits. Osmosis is leading by example in terms of innovation in the decentralized exchange category. What is Osmosis? Osmosis is the automated market maker (AMM) protocol that enables developers to create unique AMMs with sovereign liquidity pools. Osmosis, which was created with the Cosmos SDK, uses Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) to allow cross-chain transactions. The Osmosis protocol can be used by developers to create their own AMM decentralized application (dApp). Furthermore, Osmosis offers substantial customizability, including governance features that enable liquidity providers to manage the pools in which they participate. Users can utilize Osmosis to create liquidity pools with specific parameters, such as bonding curves and multi-weighted asset pools. Osmosis&apos; incentive structure is also adjustable.
