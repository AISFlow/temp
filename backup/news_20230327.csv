District Judge Jennifer Rearden, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, granted the U.S. Department of Justice's application for a stay pending an an appeal of the sale, which was previously approved by a bankruptcy judge. The move puts the sale on hold until the appeal itself can work its way through the U.S. court system.  ""Upon consideration of all parties’ written submissions, as well as the conferences and oral argument held in this matter, the Government’s emergency motion is hereby GRANTED. An opinion setting forth the reasons for this ruling will issue shortly,"" the ruling said.  Another judge, Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles of the New York Southern Bankruptcy Court, approved the sale earlier this month over government agency objections.  In the judge's view, agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Trustee's office had failed to make a persuasive case for holding off the sale, saying his mandate was to speed up the bankruptcy process to ensure Voyager creditors got their money back as soon as possible. Voyager filed for bankruptcy in July.  Wiles had also previously pushed back on an effort to pause the deal during the appeal process.

Initially proposed by U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor in April 2022, the Royal Mint was tasked with releasing the token by the summer of 2022 but faced delays. The Royal Mint had previously teased plans for utilizing blockchain technology to track its gold supply in 2017.  In a statement on Monday, the U.K.’s economic secretary Andrew Griffith said that the plans were not moving forward “at this time” but that the proposal would remain under review. Chair of the Treasury Select Committee Harriet Baldwin said that the government’s chief financial minister would be asked if issuing an NFT “remains the policy of his department.”  According to the BBC, Baldwin cited economic uncertainty across the cryptocurrency sector as a factor in sunsetting the collection.  ""We have not yet seen a lot of evidence that our constituents should be putting their money in these speculative tokens unless they are prepared to lose all their money,” said Chair of the Treasury Select Committee Harriet Baldwin. “So perhaps that is why the Royal Mint has made this decision in conjunction with the Treasury.”  Other global leaders have recently signaled a willingness to embrace NFTs and other Web3 technologies.

Terra, Celsius, and FTX are all in hindsight, and Bitcoin maintained support. The negative developments took the price down, and larger support has held. As Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) emerges from its second-worst year in its 14-year history, it's worth looking back to see some of the challenges the first and largest cryptocurrency has overcome. And, despite tremendous volatility along the way, Bitcoin has shown incredible resilience and has a setup for prospective big gains in the next 18 months. - 2014 had the Mt. Gox hack, in which the exchange lost several hundred thousand Bitcoin. - 2018 was Bitcoin's largest annual loss, at -73%. - 2022 came with the Terra Luna crash, the Celsius crash, and the FTX collapse. Additionally, Bitcoin has weathered several rounds of various regulations, including some outright bans by various countries. Nevertheless, here we are in 2023 and price is up 70% year-to-date (as of writing this article), and up 81% from the November low. Given the ""events"" of 2022, there have been concerns surrounding the Terra, Celsius, and FTX failures, but Bitcoin has managed to survive and maintain its position as the leading digital currency. While these failures have demonstrated some of the risks of the larger crypto space, what's also apparent is Bitcoin's strength and stability in the face of adversity. Lastly, though speculative as to how much of an effect this may have on the price of Bitcoin in the near term, a growing number of investors shaken by recent bank liquidity issues are taking note of the self-custody prospect available to holders of Bitcoin. In my last Seeking Alpha Bitcoin article from early 2022, the takeaway was for Bitcoin to be working on forming a lasting bottom in 2022, with a forecast favoring that $24k would contain any selling. The latter part of that forecast was proven incorrect in June of last year, when the price broke key support. From the article, the question (and answer was posed): ""What if $24k doesn't hold? Though this is not expected, it has become important to provide coverage of this prospect, given Bitcoin's detour to the least bullish of our previous expectations. First, a break below $24k does not constitute an invalidation of the primary Elliott Wave pattern that has price nearing a bottom in wave 4 of (3). A brief spike through $24k would not compromise the larger pattern, so long as price quickly and resoundingly recovers. However, a sustained break below $24k has strong ramifications for the longer term forecasts. Such a prospect would ""downshift"" our expectations to an ending diagonal pattern originating from the December 2018 lows."" Though the recent developments of the latter half of 2022 have reduced my overall confidence in reaching $100k prior to a more protracted bear market (more than has already occurred), I remain cautiously bullish in the medium term. Let's take an Elliott Wave view of the current pattern to help glean nearer-term expectations for Bitcoin, as well as key supports needed to maintain a shorter-term bullish view and resistances that need to be surpassed to shake off reasonable medium-term bearish prospects. First, considering the pattern from the 2018 low, Bitcoin has formed an upward trending 3 wave. Rally, labeled (1)-(2)-(3). Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) In Elliott Wave, we observe that typically, in strong trends, the price will form a 5 wave rally, ideally as an ""impulse."" A simple description of an impulse is a five wave trending pattern that develops with an initial microdegree five wave rally and subsequent three wave pullback or consolidation, referred to as waves 1 and 2, followed by a larger breakout with strong unidirectional price action in a micro five waves, wave 3, followed by a consolidation of that breakout, wave 4. Following the completion of wave 3, the wave 4 consolidation cannot overlap into the price action of wave 1. Finally, assuming the price holds necessary support for a wave 4 the final wave up, which should minimally make new highs exceeding the wave 3 high and maximally, in the case of blowoff tops, rise epically above the wave 3 high in climactic fashion. Coming back to the Bitcoin chart: Price has formed what appears to be a potentially impulsive pattern, with 3 complete waves from the 2018 low into the 2021 highs. As such, our expectations have been for Bitcoin to rise considerably in its 5th wave, provided wave 4 support holds. The ""standard"" support range for wave 4 in an impulse is the 38.2%-23.6% retrace of the third wave. In terms of price, this support region was $22.1k- $33.4k. In addition to these levels, we consider other key Fibonacci relationships among the various subwaves and look for confluence in levels. $24k was an area of particular confluence. Also, after the initial drop of the wave (4) into the June 2021 lows held the 23.6% retrace for all intents and purposes, followed by price slightly breaching the April 2021 highs expectations were for a test of the lower end of the standard support region, that would ideally provide a successful test of $24k to form a wave (4) bottom. Though it's valid to consider the drop into the June 2021 low all of (4) and the higher high in November all of (5) the was too abbreviated and anemic to consider it the 5th wave as the most likely interpretation. As noted previously, $24k did not hold. Often when the 38.2% retrace is resoundingly broken, it's an early signal of concern that price will not follow through on impulsive expectations. The next key support below is the 50% retrace of the wave (3). When price retraces 50% of the wave (3), it's not an invalidation of the larger impulsive expectations but any meaningful or sustained break below the 50% tips odds away from continuing to favor impulsive upside continuation. The 50% retrace, in logarithmic scale, measured from the March 2020 low to the April 2021 high (the length of wave (3)) was $15,869. This level is not to be considered a hard invalidation point. Rather, it's a pivot of sorts. The longer and deeper that price moved beneath it, the more likely it is that the impulse would fail. Though Bitcoin did break below a few times, the breaks were very minimal in terms of price and time. And based on the subsequent activity since the November low, we can say that, for all intents and purposes, the 50% retrace has held. To recap, Bitcoin has 3 up from the 2018 low, and the 2022 decline, amidst the Terra and Celsius crashes, and the revelations of fraud and quick collapse of FTX, took the price right to the acceptable edge of support for a 4th wave. In one sense, it's remarkable that Bitcoin has maintained its bullish setup amidst all of the bearish developments. In another, it has heightened concerns about the thesis that BTC will reach in excess of $100k in the current longer-term cycle from the 2018 lows. In the recent activity since the November low, we must note that price has formed what counts best as a micro 5 waves up into the Mid-February high, followed by a quick test of Fibonacci support into the mid-March low, followed by an immediate micro 5 up, exceeding the February high and the August high, a key downside resistance that effectively breaks the downtrend. With all that's transpired, though I can't rule out a lower low (which will be discussed), the primary interpretation of this action from November is an initiation move of sorts. In the accompanying chart (immediately below), this favors the black count. Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) The alternative perspective shown in the purple count suggests that the rally from the November low is a corrective - rather than an initiating - move to start a pattern up to new all-time highs. In this case, Fibonacci resistance as evaluated from the retrace of the move down from the wave (3) high down to the November 2022 low is $32.5k-$48.5k. Ultimately, BTC will need to resoundingly exceed this region to ""prove"" itself. And even though BTC has not yet reached this region, it is doing everything necessary to make a test of resistance quite likely. On a smaller degree (see chart immediately below), BTC has what counts best as a very bullish (i)-(ii), i-ii setup from the March 2023 low. This portends a big breakout once BTC breaks above this past week's high. The minimal target for this micro breakout is the $32.5k region, though $35k+ is preferred. Once BTC breaks above $32k, holding above this week's high becomes necessary for us to maintain a reasonable bullish bias. And, if alternatively, the price should break out and then come back strongly through $28.9k, it will shift odds in favor of the bearish purple count in which the price can be topping in a corrective move, setting up another decline to sub $10k levels. Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) In the favored black count, the preferred path for BTC over the coming weeks is a series of breakouts and consolidations over support to ultimately take the price upwards of $40k before the next key inflection point. Prior to the expected breakout, the two key support areas are $25.7k-$26.9k, and below $25k, the lower support region for the expected breakout to $32k+ is $22.5k-$24.7k. Right now, based on the consolidation just beneath last week's high, the upper support region is favored to hold. That said, should this week begin with some selling pressure, a test of lower support is quite fine for the current setup so long as $21k is holding. Below there, strongly reduces odds of any immediate upside continuation. On a sentimental note, the type of disinterest that's pervasive throughout the market is typical for this early stage of a larger 5th wave. We've seen this numerous times in Elliott Wave study across different markets. Will it be different this time? Is the herd correct to have lost interest in BTC for the next few years? Possibly. But given the guidelines and parameters that this technical approach provides us, I'm keen on playing the long side given the phenomenal implied risk-to-reward skew offered in the current stance. My larger degree target for BTC to complete this 5th wave is $108k-$140k.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4590441-bitcoin-is-bear-market-in-rearview-mirror-or-just-initial-decline?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11119706.jpeg

42421301,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnoLt,1679950894,Macro Is Back to Moving the Digital Asset Markets,"For the past nine months, overall macro conditions have taken a back seat to the idiosyncratic failures (FTX, Terra's LUNA/UST, BlockFi, CoinDesk sister company Genesis) and success stories (the Ethereum Merge, various layer 2 launches) that drove most of the price action. But macro regained its position behind the wheel over the past few weeks. The banking crisis and subsequent policy response have taken center stage – only this time it is affecting digital assets positively at the expense of other asset classes. A quick look at the bitcoin (BTC) price versus the regional banking exchange-traded fund (KRE) tells you all you need to know about the winners and losers since the first week of March.  Jeff Dorman, CFA, is chief Investment officer and co-founder of Arca.  While digital assets gain, macro investors are dipping back into the recession playbook:  Front-end rates are down sharply, while long rates are only slightly lower (bull steepener – a classic recession trade).  Gold is ripping and closing in on an all-time high.  Crude oil is getting smoked.  Small caps and growth stocks are underperforming large caps and value stocks, while defensives are leading cyclicals.  Technology is getting valuation support from falling rates.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has lost credibility. The two-year Treasury yield has fallen from an intra-month high of 5.08% to its current 3.75% yield, which is a startling enough move as it is. It is even more dramatic when you factor in the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise its benchmark rate 25 basis points (bps) to 5% at the same time.  That’s the market’s way of telling you it’s calling the Fed’s bluff. The fed funds rate started the month below the two-year yields, and is currently 125 bps higher. This spread is now the largest between the fed funds rate and two-year Treasury yield since 2007 and has historically led to quick and aggressive rate cuts.  Further, the “Fed put” is back in play as assets on the central bank's balance sheet increased by $392 billion over the last two weeks, wiping out 60% of the value of the quantitative tightening done since last April.  Not to be outdone, the Treasury Department has also lost credibility. After joining the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in their explicit defense of depositors of a select few failed regional banks, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen can’t decide whether to offer full support explicitly or instead avoid moral hazard. In the last three days Yellen has flip-flopped multiple times on her position regarding an increase in the level of deposit insurance. Yellen’s previous remarks on the state of the economy haven’t aged well. In 2017, she confidently stated that she didn’t believe we would see another financial crisis “in our lifetime.”  And lest we forget about Credit Suisse – a forced shotgun marriage to UBS left shareholders and many CoCo bondholders dead or nearly dead, but the Swiss bank has been a problem child for at least 15 years. As Bloomberg reported:  “Credit Suisse’s failings have included a criminal conviction for allowing drug dealers to launder money in Bulgaria, entanglement in a Mozambique corruption case, a spying scandal involving a former employee and an executive and a massive leak of client data to the media. Its association with disgraced financier Lex Greensill and failed New York-based investment firm Archegos Capital Management compounded the sense of an institution that didn’t have a firm grip on its affairs. Many fed-up clients have voted with their feet, leading to unprecedented client outflows in late 2022.”  Ironically, trying to kill crypto while saving the banks ultimately saves crypto, too.  With this backdrop – a Fed that has lost control, a Treasury secretary who has lost touch and an accelerating global banking crisis – it’s perhaps not surprising that crypto app downloads jumped 15% last week while those of banking apps have fallen around 5%. The market is showing its lack of confidence in our governments and financial systems via a renewed interest in a potential alternative – which is hilarious when you consider that this increase in crypto adoption is happening concurrently with the Security and Exchange Commission’s war on digital assets.  The SEC most recently issued an investor alert urging caution when investing in digital assets, which reads fine and accurate in isolation – you should be cautious when investing in digital assets. But the timing of this statement, amid a series of other enforcement actions for the year to date, seems disingenuous considering all of the other much larger problems in the global financial markets. Meanwhile, the SEC also sent Coinbase a Wells Notice, setting the stage for an epic court battle between two obstinate behemoths.  Read more: Noelle Acheson – Bitcoin and the Liquidity Question: More Complex Than It Seems  Try as the SEC, Treasury, White House and Fed may, there’s just no way to put the genie back in the bottle at this point. The bull case for crypto is on full display as banks shutter and their depositors and investors hit the eject button. Granted, this will cause operations and the flow of capital to be even more cumbersome for digital asset participants as well. We are already starting to see the effects as liquidity is sucked out of the digital assets spot market.  However, the real battle isn’t between digital asset investors and regulators but between banks and stablecoin issuers. Stablecoin issuers still depend on banks to keep their reserves, and banks have been very resistant to help a sector that is trying to put them out of business – which, of course, makes sense.  Arthur Hayes wrote a great piece at the end of 2022 about the friction between banks and stablecoins before any of the banking failures commenced. The very heart of the problem is that rising rates is great for stablecoin issuers because they keep all of the interest income themselves and pass none of it on to token holders, whereas rising rates cause a real problem for banks who lose depositors when they don’t pass along the interest, and also become underwater on their longer-term loans. Here is what he said:  “... [D]o you understand why banks HATE these monstrosities? Stablecoins do banking better than banks since they operate on almost 100% profit margins. Any time you read FUD about this or that stablecoin, just remember: the banks are just jealous.”  And getting rid of current iterations of stablecoins in favor of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) isn’t much better. In a 2022 report, McKinsey estimated that globally banks stand to lose $2.1 trillion in annual revenue if a successful retail CBDC is introduced.  The reality is, even though we are trying to build a digital infrastructure that runs in parallel to the existing financial system, the ecosystem is still very intertwined with the traditional banking system. So, ironically, trying to kill crypto while saving the banks ultimately saves crypto, too. It’s a win-win right now for blockchain enthusiasts.

The decision, which is subject to a bankruptcy court’s approval, comes after a DFPI investigation found the now-bankrupt crypto lender “failed to provide timely notification” to borrowers that they could stop repaying their loans after the company had paused withdrawals on its platform. As a result, BlockFi’s California borrowers remitted at least $103,471 worth of loan repayments to the lender's servicer.  BlockFi froze client withdrawals and deposits to wallets and interest accounts on Nov. 11, 2022, following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The exposure to FTX eventually led to BlockFi’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection two weeks later.

42387821,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQu2P5,1679947805,Bitcoin Sinks Below $27K After CFTC Files Suit Against Binance,"Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below $27,000 after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao over allegations that the exchange knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S., a violation of federal law.  The BTC/USD trading pair on the Coinbase exchange dropped to $26,525, its lowest point since March 17, data from TradingView showed. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $26,978, down 3.1% in the past 24 hours.  “As far as I can see the crypto community is putting this news on the 'here we go again' pile,” Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, told CoinDesk.  Kempenaer said the Binance-CFTC lawsuit “very likely” sent BTC's price lower. However, he added that the lawsuit’s “implications are unclear,” even as it offered the latest example of increased regulatory scrutiny, a trend that the industry will continue to monitor closely. He said that bitcoin might fall to its previous breakout level near $25,000.  ""As long as that level holds, the break from a long-term bottoming formation is still in play,"" he said. But he added that “taking out heavy overhead resistance range between $29,000 and $32,000 will free up the way for a much stronger move higher.""  Monday’s Binance-CFTC news caught traders who bet on a price gain off-guard. They liquidated some $39 million worth of BTC’s long positions, according to data from Coinglass.  In the lawsuit against Binance filed in U.S. District Court in Illinois, the CFTC called several cryptos including BTC, ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD) commodities. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has previously suggested that proof-of-stake tokens are securities.  ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency, fell below $1,700 before recently rebounding to $1,703, still off 3.6% from Sunday, same time. BNB, the native token of the Binance-initiated blockchain network BNB Chain, has declined by over 5% to about $310 from roughly $327 a day ago. Litecoin (LTC) was trading down nearly 4.8%.  The regulatory unclarity is a “concerning” factor for moving the markets, especially the specific allegations contained within the CFTC suit, according to Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, told CoinDesk.  ""Binance is by far the largest crypto exchange in the world and thus has an outsized impact on markets,"" Carey said, although he added that the drop in markets hasn't been ""too severe,"" given the importance of this regulatory news.  Some crypto-related stocks also dropped. Shares of exchange Coinbase (COIN) and bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) slid by 8% and 6%, respectively.  Equity markets were mixed Monday afternoon as investors weighed the announcement that regional lender First Citizens BancShares would buy most of the business of Silicon Valley Bank.

42410998,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvTgC,1679946101,"Asset Managers’ Bitcoin Exposure Rises, Reversing Recent Trend","Asset managers’ appetite for bitcoin (BTC) appears to have increased over the last week, a sign that larger investors continue to see value in the asset.  The most recent Commitment of Traders (COT) report shows that asset managers increased their open long positions by 975 contracts as of March 21. This marks a reversal from the prior three weeks, where asset managers reduced their longs by a total of 1,482 contracts.  COT data is released weekly by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and details the positions and open interest of traders of bitcoin futures contracts into “Dealer/Intermediary,” “Asset Manager/Institutional” and “Leveraged Funds” categories.  Asset managers now comprise 49.1% of open long positions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), up from 44% the week prior. The increased bitcoin exposure has come after prices for the asset increased 15% from March 14-21, and indicates positive sentiment among institutional investors, although the CFTC's lawsuit on Monday against exchange giant Binance could change their perspective.  Still, asset managers with reportable positions are now 96.60% long bitcoin. This figure has risen to as high as 99% in prior COT reports.  It will be important to view subsequent reports to determine if the increased bullishness continues, or if asset managers reduce exposure.  Traders are likely to continue monitoring BTC reaction following the filing of the CFTC lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao.  The suit alleges that the defendants knowingly disregarded provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act while engaging in a calculated strategy of regulatory arbitrage to their commercial benefit. Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume.  The price of BTC fell as low as $26,670 following the announcement, before recovering a portion of the loss in the subsequent trading hour. Hourly trading volume spiked to more than 390% of its average as the asset immediately sold off.  Bitcoin as an asset is a separate entity from Binance as an exchange, but the CFTC’s announcement may have stoked liquidity concerns among current BTC holders, particularly if they trade via Binance.  While the CFTC action may be troublesome for Binance, larger investors may view bitcoin's decline as an opportunity to acquire the asset at a discount.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/27/asset-managers-bitcoin-exposure-rises-reversing-recent-trend,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72ae280e7f877c015503d0e65549a58cf333d430-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Giancarlo.  “That [U.S.] digital dollar would take over the world,” Giancarlo, co-founder of the Digital Dollar Project and senior counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher’s Digital Works unit, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Monday.  He said other countries around the world – notably China – are much further along in creating a CBDC. He doesn’t see why the U.S. “can’t counter China and, to some degree, Europe with a digital currency that is operationally and transparently private.”  That need for transparency, which Giancarlo discussed in a recent CoinDesk editorial, is particularly important at a time when some U.S. lawmakers on both the state and federal levels are trying to keep CBDCs out of the country.  Last week, Florida Gov. Ron Desantis proposed legislation to ban the use of a national CBDC within the state. In Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) introduced a bill that would stop the Federal Reserve from creating a direct-to-consumer central bank digital currency. Congressman Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) also introduced a bill prohibiting the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency directly to individuals.  Giancarlo said he doesn’t entirely agree with the lawmakers but he does understand their concerns about protecting people’s privacy and their autonomy in an internet-based financial system. Lawmakers may be apprehensive because they, “are likely looking to the Chinese model,” which he said, “has already created a benchmark for what a central bank digital currency could be like.”  “Where I differ with them is the assumption that we in America, the world’s most ingenuitive nation history’s ever known, could not design a very different central bank digital currency,” Giancarlo said. He added that if the digital dollar is created using open architecture, it could potentially satisfy users’ surveillance concerns.  Not all crypto is a security  During his time at the CFTC, Giancarlo said, he was among those involved in the decision to designate bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, as a commodity as well as the initial work on others including ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency.  Now, as federal regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission look to label cryptocurrencies such as ETH, as securities, Giancarlo said that “it’s not correct that all crypto is a security. … Crypto is architecture. Crypto is algorithms,"" he said.  The SEC and CFTC can make near-term decisions on whether a cryptocurrency is a security or a commodity, Giancarlo said, but it is ultimately up to Congress to make those determinations.  “Certainly, we very much need Congress now to step in,” he said.

Binance decided to pause its no-fee trading promotion for 13 BTC spot trading pairs after just nine months, it said in a March 22 release , in a move that was likely a main driver in sending its global market share 10% lower since reinstating fees. The exchange also suffered a two-hour outage last week due to a software bug that forced it to pause spot trading and could have contributed to the drop in market share. Interestingly, Binance said it would eliminate trading fees just for BTC-TUSD pair, which was only recently re-listed. ""It is unclear why Binance has chosen to promote its TUSD pair, although it appears the exchange has selected the stablecoin as a successor to BUSD, which is being phased out because of regulatory actions in the U.S.,"" Kaiko wrote in a research newsletter. Prior to launching zero fees in July, the firm's trading market share for the 13 BTC pairs, Kaiko noted , was only 25% before more than doubling. “It has now been just 5 days since fees were reinstated, and market share has halved and is currently below 30%.” The centralized exchange is also dealing with increased regulatory scrutiny, having been sued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission for allegedly offering unregistered crypto derivatives offerings to customers in the U.S. The lawsuit roiled the broader crypto market in mid-afternoon trading .",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3951602-bitcoin-trading-volume-on-binance-hits-lowest-since-july-2022-data-shows?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11116558.jpeg

The Arbitrum Foundation said Twitter flagged the account in error, however, and it was reinstated within a few hours.  The co-founder of Offchain Labs, the company behind Arbitrum, Harry Kalodner, initially confirmed the suspension in a text message to CoinDesk, although he said he was unsure of Twitter’s rationale. “The Arbitrum Foundation which now controls that account is investigating,” said Kalodner.  The account was eventually restored. According to a representative for the Arbitrum Foundation, Twitter Support explained in a message that ""[w]e have systems that find and remove multiple automated spam accounts in bulk, and yours was flagged as spam by mistake.""  The Arbitrum suspension drama comes less than a week after the much-hyped rollout of Arbitrum’s new ARB governance token. The ARB launch, like similar buzzy token launches, was seized on by scammers who used spoof social media accounts and elaborate phishing schemes to steal from unwitting investors. Many of those scam accounts are still live on Twitter.  Togrhul Mahararramov, a developer for the Ethereum rollup platform Scroll, said Twitter was ""consistently awful"" for allowing scam accounts to proliferate while the authentic Arbitrum account was pulled offline.  Arbitrum is a layer 2 rollup platform that allows users to transact on the Ethereum blockchain and pay lower transaction fees. It’s currently the largest Ethereum rollup by trading volume and total value locked, according to DefiLlama. The Arbitrum DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) – which is constituted by holders of ARB – took over development of the platform last week with the release of the token. Previously, the platform and its Twitter account were officially maintained by Offchain Labs.

42414055,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvUJl,1679942808,U.S. Bank Regulators Investigating Leaders of the Failed Tech Banks,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is investigating the actions of the leaders of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank to hold them accountable for the banks' collapses, said Chairman Martin Gruenberg, who detailed their mismanagement and dangerous business concentrations – especially in digital assets at Signature – in testimony prepared for a U.S. Senate hearing, scheduled to be held Tuesday.  Top officials from the companies will face scrutiny “for the losses they caused to the banks and for their misconduct in the management of the banks,” Gruenberg said in the written remarks set for delivery to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, which also detailed the implosion of crypto-focused Silvergate Bank.  In testimony for the same hearing, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Michael Barr shared similar revelations about trouble inside California-based Silicon Valley Bank.  The FDIC put itself on the hook for an expected $22.5 billion hit to its insurance fund, mostly to cover uninsured deposits, Gruenberg said in his descriptions of the fall of Silicon Valley and New York-based Signature – which were among the crypto sector’s favorite financial institutions. The trouble began last year, when crypto exchange FTX went down and dragged some of the industry with it.  Though Signature was more well-rounded that Silvergate, where 68% of the deposits exited as crypto’s disastrous 2022 wound down, Gruenberg said Signature still had one-fifth of its deposits from the digital-assets industry at the end of 2022.  “Signature Bank, like Silvergate, experienced deposit withdrawals and a drop in its stock price as a consequence of disruptions in the digital-asset market due to failures of several high-profile digital-asset companies,” Gruenberg said.  Silvergate, a small, La Jolla, Calif.-based bank, was almost entirely reliant on the crypto sector and was doomed when many of the businesses had to pull out their cash. But it managed to execute an unusual self-liquidation that spared the FDIC from taking it into receivership, as it did with the two larger institutions.  At the Fed, Barr admitted the final collapse of Silicon Valley Bank caught agency supervisors off guard, even though they had spent months admonishing the bank and restricting its growth because of poor management.  Barr said the bank was a “textbook case of mismanagement.” And its government minders were well aware it had serious problems. In 2021, the supervisors found issues with its liquidity management, and in 2022, they determined an array of problems with board oversight, risk management and internal auditing, Barr said. That summer, they dropped the bank’s management and governance ratings to alarm-bell levels, subjecting it to growth restrictions.  Five months ago, the bank’s supervisors from the Fed met with managers from the bank to let the managers know their interest-rate risks were unacceptable. The supervisors brought those concerns to the Fed’s Board of Governors last month.  “Staff relayed that they were actively engaged with SVB, but as it turned out, the full extent of the bank's vulnerability was not apparent until the unexpected bank run on March 9,” Barr said.  While the FDIC and Fed conduct their reviews of what went on inside the banks, the regulatory agencies – FDIC for Signature and Fed for Silicon Valley – are reviewing their own actions in the run-up to two of the largest banking failures in U.S. history.  Gruenberg’s FDIC will also be trying to figure out how to replenish the damage to what had been a $128 billion insurance fund.

The exchange, along with its cofounder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, were sued by the CFTC on allegations that it violated certain trading and derivatives rules. It alleged that Binance solicited U.S. users via unregistered crypto derivatives offerings, and directed its employees and customers to hide their true location by using VPNs to evade compliance controls. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dropped to $26.7K, its lowest on over a week, before paring losses to trade 3.1% lower at $26.99K as of 2.13 pm ET. Meanwhile, ether ( ETH-USD ) slipped 3.3% to $1.71K. ""Crypto participants are reconciled to the view that crypto regulation would now be driven by the judiciary, and the hopes of a Congress-led regulation seem bleak, at least in the short to medium term,"" said Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. He noted that the current crypto market is mostly internal capital, i.e. capital that has chosen to stay through the bear cycle. ""So while new capital may not have entered the space, the capital that refuses to leave sets the price bottom."" Other exchanges also slid, including: Coinbase ( COIN ) -11% , Bakkt ( BKKT ) -6.7% , Robinhood ( HOOD ) -1% . Miners that were in the red include: Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) -9.4% , Marathon Digital ( MARA ) -8.3% , Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) -6.4% , Bit Digital ( BTBT ) -6.1% .

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), a gauge of the broader crypto market, extended its decline after the suit was first filed, sliding 3% to $27.01K as of shortly before 2:30 p.m. ET. Binance coin ( BNB-USD ) also came under selling pressure, down 6.1% to $307.79. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, Illinois, alleged that Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, solicited U.S. users via unregistered crypto derivatives offerings despite having no authority to conduct business in the country. Overall, Binance, Zhao and Samuel Lim, Binance's former chief compliance officer, allegedly broke eight provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act. They allegedly “actively cultivated lucrative and commercially important ‘VIP’ customers, including institutional customers, located in the United States,” said the regulator, which has been probing Binance since at least 2021. In addition, the centralized exchange directed its employees and customers to hide their true location by using virtual private networks (VPNs) to evade compliance controls, according to the CFTC. “VPNs have the effect of masking an internet user’s true IP address,"" the suit alleged. ""VPN use by customers to access and trade on the Binance platform has been an open secret, and Binance has consistently been aware of and encouraged the use of VPNs by U.S. customers,” as they comprised a ""substantial proportion of Binance’s customer base.” The suit ""is unexpected and disappointing as we have been working collaboratively with the CFTC for more than two years,"" a Binance spokesperson told Seeking Alpha via email. Over the past two years, Binance has ""made significant investments... to ensure we do not have US users active on our platform,"" spokesperson added, including ratcheting up the size of its compliance team to some 750 people and spending $80M on external partners who support its compliance programs. (Added at 2:10 p.m. ET) “Today’s enforcement action demonstrates that there is no location, or claimed lack of location, that will prevent the CFTC from protecting American investors. I have been clear that the CFTC will continue to use all of its authority to find and stop misconduct in the volatile and risky digital asset market,” CFTC chair Rostin Benham said in a statement .

42411026,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB3uU,1679940367,US Crypto Firms Eye Overseas Move Amid Regulatory Uncertainty,"I recently spoke with U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), aka “the Crypto Queen,” who wants to pass legislation that will bring regulatory clarity to the cryptocurrency space. She’s frustrated it hasn’t yet happened. “The failure of the United States Congress to enact policy is pushing the industry to other countries,” she said. “Europe is ahead of us in terms of its regulatory framework. Australia and the U.K. are getting ahead of us. Switzerland is far ahead of us.”  Other notables have said something similar. The CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, told Bloomberg the crypto industry has “already started” moving outside of the U.S. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, is considering launching an overseas trading desk, driven by U.S. regulatory uncertainty. Circle, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is opening a new office in Paris because, as Circle’s chief strategy officer has said, “France is increasingly seen as a leader in crypto.”  So how serious is this threat? Are U.S. crypto companies really leaving? Or are these just the Web3 boys who cried wolf? (Garlinghouse, after all, threatened to move Ripple’s headquarters from the U.S. in 2020. Ripple is still here.)  Read more: Emily Parker - Keep Crypto in America  “100%. It’s happening. It is absolutely true that people are leaving,” says Jason Gottlieb, a crypto-focused lawyer and partner at Morrison Cohen. Gottlieb says many of these founders are 20-something, without kids, and are able to work from anywhere. “Some of the brightest young entrepreneurs we have are saying, ‘Well, forget it. I’ll go to the Caymans. I’ll go to Portugal. I’ll go to Singapore.’”  I’ve seen some of this. In 2018 and 2019 I lived exclusively abroad, bouncing around digital nomad hubs including Lisbon, Budapest, Chiang Mai and Bali. Each spot had a bustling crypto scene. If you’re young and single and filled with wanderlust, why wouldn’t you want to live in a beachfront villa that costs $600 per month? (As I wrote in 2018, crypto and digital nomads are a natural fit because “nomads, by definition, are decentralized.”) Then the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this broader trend of Americans working overseas as the rest of the world discovered the concept of remote work.  And now? The last few weeks of regulatory and banking concerns have added “jet fuel” to crypto looking overseas, says David Nage, portfolio manager at Arca. “The ability to operate is becoming less and less profitable for many startups in the United States,” he says, adding that many founders are considering Europe, Hong Kong and Latin America as possible alternatives. “No one has left yet,” says Nage. “They are exploring their options.”  So as of now the threat to leave is mostly talk, not action. But there’s a lot of talk. “This comes up constantly,” says Paul Kuveke, the chief operating officer of Mintbase, a non-fungible token (NFT) platform incorporated in the US. Kuveke says the decision of staying or leaving the U.S. is a frequent topic of conversation and is “something we constantly monitor.” One big reason is the legal ambiguity. “We live in a lot of gray areas. We want answers,” says Kuveke. “Every conversation to do anything involves a consultation with lawyers. It’s expensive.” He adds that confusion about crypto tokens (are they a security?) has spooked founders. “If you’re going to do a token sale of any kind, the consensus is to not launch in the United States. Go somewhere else,” says Kuveke.  The last month has seen a spate of government-mandated shutdowns of banking services for crypto companies, in what some are calling “Operation Choke Point 2.0” – a reference to an Obama-era program to deny financial services to legal but politically undesirable activities. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched enforcement actions against major players including Coinbase, accusing the platforms of flouting securities laws.  Read more: Boyd Cohen - I’m American, but My Crypto Startup Won’t Be  Anxiety over tokens is one reason developers can have incentive to move overseas, says Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association. “A lot of developers are compensated in tokens,” says Smith, such as those who contribute to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Smith cites a report from Electric Capital, a VC firm, titled “U.S. Share of Web3 Developers Is Shrinking.” It says that “global Web3 software development activity has grown more outside the U.S., threatening the U.S.’s preeminence in finance and technology.”  As my colleague Emily Parker has compellingly argued, crypto leaving the U.S. would impact more than just crypto. Think about the economic impact. “If you have a gigantic office building stuffed with tech workers in New York City, all those people are going to eat lunch in sandwich shops across the street,” says Gottlieb. “Now they’re eating Ban Mian from the streets of Singapore.” Nage estimates that $3 billion of crypto wages in the U.S. translates to over $750 million in taxes, and “there are definitely going to be countries that are welcome to that tax revenue.” Smith even considers the growth of Web3 to be important to national security because “the next generation of the internet is going to be built on top of crypto networks,” and “we want to make sure the U.S. is leading that.”  It’s happening. It is absolutely true that people are leaving.  For Nexo, a crypto lending platform, leaving the U.S. was not just theoretical. “We had gotten to the point where retaining [U.S.] customers actually created difficulties and costs which didn’t match the expected revenue,” says Antoni Trenchev, Nexo’s co-founder and managing partner. “On the engineering side, certain products couldn’t be offered in the same way [in the U.S.] so we had to rework the platform,” he says, which increased their engineering costs. Ultimately the situation was “not viable,” so Nexo planned an orderly 18-month withdrawal. (It’s true that Nexo was issued cease-and-desist letters from several states; Trenchev says “that really caught us by surprise” because at that point they were already conducting a phased withdrawal.)  Trenchev has no regrets. Nexo has replaced the market share it lost in the U.S. with growth in the Middle East, North Africa and Southeast Asia, he says. Nexo is setting up its new headquarters in Dubai, which Trenchev describes as having clear and friendly crypto regulations and a welcoming atmosphere. “You have a lot of expats moving here,” says Trenchev, who adds that 800 crypto companies are “setting up shop” in the United Arab Emirates, which “creates an ecosystem of professionals and people you can hire.” Trenchev was particularly impressed by Dubai’s “Zero Problem policy” – a philosophy that businesses should face zero problems when they do business. For him, the perks of “zero problems” have included clear regulations, top-tier internet, banks that welcome crypto clients and “food that only takes 15 minutes to get delivered.”  Others could soon be joining him. Smith says that she frequently hears joking comments from members of the Blockchain Association such as, “I guess we’re moving to Dubai!” Some of that could be real, and some of that could be purely in jest. For many, this is similar to when Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 and many Democrats talked about moving north to Canada.  Most stayed put, however. It’s easy to joke about moving to Montreal but harder to actually do it, which is something many crypto companies are discovering. “The United States, overall, has the best infrastructure and support for small businesses in general,” says Kuveke, who has found it easier to do banking in the U.S. than Portugal, where he says the banks are “mind-bogglingly terrible.” And moving to another country is “not a casual process,” says Kuveke, because it involves a gauntlet of paperwork and approvals and is “many months of work.” As of now his company, Mintbase, plans to remain in the United States.  Marshall Hayner, the CEO of Metallicus, a digital asset banking network, also decided to remain in the U.S. One reason is the simple fact that he enjoys living in the United States. “I love it here,” says Hayner. But the motives are not just sentimental. “20% of the crypto market is based in the U.S.,” says Hayner, and he has little interest in abandoning that lucrative customer base. He also thinks it’s important to be in the U.S. for a company to have legitimacy. “If you’re not part of the U.S. market, you just can’t be that big in the world of technology, right? You just can’t.”  We’re at this critical moment. We really need to get the tone of government to change.  Then there’s the possibility that in the future, if and when the U.S. passes clear regulation, the other international standards will eventually follow suit. “When it comes to regulation and policy around financial services, the gold standard tends to be the U.S. and Europe. And then the other countries follow,” says Hayner. So his logic is that if the U.S. ultimately issues guidelines that shape the global framework, why ditch the U.S. (and its wealthy customers) now just for a bit of corner cutting?  Kuveke has the same approach. “The U.S. will always take the lead on this stuff,” he says. “There’s not another country in my mind that will come out with regulation that everyone else will adopt.” Kuveke clarifies that this is a long-term analysis – no one knows when the U.S. will take action – and that others in the space might not share his optimism because “most startups and small businesses don’t have the luxury of thinking on a 5-year or 10-year time horizon.”  Read more: Crypto.com Moves Closer to an Operational License in Dubai  This overall approach – swallow the bitter medicine of U.S. compliance, hope for better in the future – squares with what Preston Byrne, the tech and crypto-focused partner at Brown Rudnick, sees from his clients. “Most of my American clients want to comply with American law,” says Byrne. He adds that they are taking a “harder approach towards compliance, even if it’s going to slow them down in the beginning.”  All that said, it’s possible that even if companies do not completely “leave” the U.S., in a more subtle manner the bumpy regulatory environment could leave the nation worse off. “We see less growth of new products and services,” says the Blockchain Association’s Smith. She points to Coinbase as an example, saying the company has effectively said, “Maybe we need to focus on our derivatives offerings overseas.”  On a more macro level, Byrne says that because of the deep coffers of venture capital in Silicon Valley and New York, “the United States has sucked all of the oxygen out of the room, from a global point of view.” But if the U.S. is about to get “kneecapped by their own regulators,” then that oxygen will flow to other parts of the world.  Smith doesn’t see an exodus as inevitable. “We’re at this critical moment. We really need to get the tone of government to change,” she says. “We need to spread the fact that this is still a relatively nascent technology but there’s potential, and we want the United States to lead the innovation.” Ultimately, she thinks that “all is not lost. We can still turn this around.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/27/crypto-leaving-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e085d5620eec87725a137743fa9a8e96606278ad-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421289,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXno8T,1679939214,The ‘Skull of Satoshi’ Proves Bitcoin Mining Discourse Isn’t Dead,"Last week, Benjamin Von Wong unveiled an art installation he was commissioned to create by Greenpeace USA for its “Change the Code, Not the Climate” campaign. The $5 million campaign is funded by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and aims to change Bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm through a “code change” in order to save the environment.  The idea being that PoW uses energy and other consensus algorithms do not.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Von Wong’s art piece was revealed Thursday, March 23, in a blog post and video. He calls it the “Skull of Satoshi” – an apt name for an 11-foot tall skull made of wood, recycled styrofoam and 300+ pieces of electronic waste. The skull also features red laser eyes, a nod to the Bitcoin Twitter community who wear laser eyes in their profile pictures.  Instead of enraging the Bitcoin community, as Greenpeace's campaign normally does, the Skull was almost immediately generally embraced because it was really cool.  I mean, just look at how metal, how punk rock the whole art installation is. It’s literally an 11-foot skull with glowing red laser eyes and smokestacks growing out the top. What’s not to love?  Bitcoiners tweeted about how much they liked the Skull of Satoshi and some changed their Twitter profile pictures. Still there was hesitation from others to embrace the art because of where the money behind it came from. From that angle, Von Wong was lambasted.  Without getting into too much detail, the conversation about moving Bitcoin from proof-of-work to something else, like proof-of-stake (PoS), which doesn’t use much energy, is generally a nonstarter. Bitcoin will almost certainly never move away from proof-of-work. That isn’t obvious from the outside, so that’s exactly where Von Wong began his journey to understand bitcoin mining.  In a reflective tweet thread, Von Wong said he thought the Bitcoin environmental problem was “black and white.” After the “phenomenal accident” of the Skull of Satoshi, Von Wong spent time in conversation with environmentalist bitcoiners including Level39, Troy Cross and Daniel Batten. He now recognizes that Bitcoin can be a powerful force for improving the environment.  This creates a somewhat interesting parallel. Greenpeace will still presumably use the Skull of Satoshi to promote its “change the code” campaign, but it will work everywhere except on the internet where the skull has become somewhat of a mascot for Bitcoin’s environmental potential even without moving its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work.  The story here is that Von Wong went from “there’s only one way to fix Bitcoin’s environmental problem” to “actually, there are many ways to fix Bitcoin’s environmental problem” in the space of a few days. It’s not a story because Von Wong is someone big, important or special. It’s a story because as more and more people get interested in Bitcoin the environmental question will certainly come up again and again. And bitcoiners will, and must, be ready to engage constructively.  For someone who has been around Bitcoin for a while, I viewed Von Wong’s learning process around the nuances of bitcoin mining as honestly unsurprising. The fact that it was carried out in what seemed like a relatively nonabrasive way bodes well for onboarding future environmentalist-leaning bitcoiners.  If Bitcoin is to succeed, we need more bitcoiners. And because Bitcoin and environmentalism are not mutually exclusive, there are ways for PoW blockchains to be a positive force.  Bitcoin is for everyone, including environmentalists.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/27/the-skull-of-satoshi-proves-bitcoin-mining-discourse-isnt-dead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/398f2923eb10acc175310d33458f72634c249d24-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The approved proposals include Maker’s guiding principles called “Constitution,” which was written by Maker founder Rune Christensen, and lay a new foundation for the protocol’s governance, development and investments of its reserves.  Some 76% of voters favored the proposal, according to Maker’s governance site.  Maker is a lending platform that issues the $5.3 billion stablecoin DAI, backing its value with digital assets from borrowers, and increasingly, with real-world assets such as liabilities from traditional financial institutions like banks.  The platform is led by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called MakerDAO that manages the platform through proposals, community discussions and votes. Investors who hold the platform’s governance token maker (MKR) may participate in votes, and their choice is weighted by the amount of tokens they own.  Maker’s “endgame”  The approval marks a step forward in Maker’s major overhaul called “Endgame,” boosted by Christensen. The initiative aims to overhaul how MakerDAO functions in its core.  The proposal included breaking up the DAO’s current structure into smaller units called SubDAOs, which are self-governing and self-sustaining entities with their own tokens within the MakerDAO ecosystem.  The plan also aims to boost platform revenues by investing a part of Maker’s more than $7 billion reserves into real-world assets and money-market funds, and further decentralize the backing of DAI stablecoin to make it more resistant against censorship and sanctions.  The move also restructures DAO’s governance by establishing new groups such as Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs), Constitutional Delegates (CDs) and Constitutional Conservers (CCs).  The plan faced some pushback from Maker investor Andreesen Horowitz in October. PaperImperium, a pseudonymous MakerDAO delegate, called out Maker for curbing delegates discussing Maker publicly under the new rules.  “While there are plenty of imperfections in the Endgame reforms and the constitutional processes, we are better off uniting around the clean slate those reforms provide and working to make the new Maker as dynamic and successful as possible,” delegate platform Frontier Research posted on Maker’s governance forum.

42414063,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvV0D,1679936029,Binance's Bitcoin Trading Volume Hits Lowest Level in 8 Months Following Termination of Zero-Fee Trading,"Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, recorded its lowest bitcoin (BTC) trading volume on Sunday since July 4, 2022, according to data from Kaiko.  Volume for 13 trading pairs, which once accounted for roughly half of the exchange’s volume, has dropped to about 30%. The exchange’s global market share, which peaked at over 70%, has dropped to about 58%.  Average volumes of the BTC-USDT trading pair have plummeted 90%, Kaiko noted.  The declines come after the exchange halted its no-fee trading promotion for the 13 bitcoin spot trading pairs, including BTC-USDT, on March 22. Binance called the promotion temporary. In an email to CoinDesk last week, Clara Medalie, research director at Kaiko, wrote that without zero-fee, she expected “a short-term drop in market share.”  Binance’s zero-fee trading promotion on July 8 increased volume for both tether USD (USDT) and binance USD (BUSD) and helped Binance increase its market share to 72% from 50%, according to Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey.  As of mid-March, zero-fee trade volume accounted for 66% of Binance’s trading volume.  Binance phased out zero-fee trading last week, with the exception of the trueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin. “It is unclear why Binance has chosen to promote its TUSD pair, although it appears the exchange has selected the stablecoin as a successor to BUSD, which is being phased out because of regulatory actions in the U.S,” the report from Kaiko said.  Before zero fees started, Binance’s trading market share for the 13 BTC pairs was just 25% before more than doubling. “It has now been just 5 days since fees were reinstated, and market share has halved and is currently below 30%,” Kaiko said.  Binance’s global market share is down 10% since last week. The exchange suffered a two hour outage last week, the result of a computer bug that forced it to suspend spot market trading and could have contributed to the drop.  In recent weeks, Binance has also endured increased regulatory scrutiny. On Monday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued the exchange and founder Changpeng Zhao on allegations the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law.

42421229,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqov,1679931715,"Illia Polosukhin: Building Near's Blockchain, Embedding AI","Illia Polosukhin didn’t set out to build a blockchain protocol. Ever since he was a 10-year-old in Ukraine, Polosukhin has been fascinated by machine learning and artificial intelligence – he thinks it might have started with seeing the movies “The Matrix” and the extremely underrated “A.I.”  And Polosukhin was smart. Even brilliant. So in 2014 he joined Google Research, where he worked on developing the models and tools that would eventually feed into artificial intelligence. He co-authored papers and he moved the science forward. But he wanted to do more. “Google has a lot of benefits, and it’s a great place to learn, but it moves really slowly,” says Polosukhin. “I wanted to move faster. I wanted to build a startup.”  Illia Polosukhin is a speaker at this year's Consensus festival in Austin.  So in 2017, along with Alexander Skidanov he co-founded NEAR.AI, which, in the beginning, was completely focused on artificial intelligence. It had nothing to do with blockchain or crypto or non-fungible tokens (NFT) or HODLing.  That was then. Now, of course, Near is one of the most prominent blockchain protocols in the space, and claims to have 25 million accounts and 446,000 daily transactions and a flourishing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapp) and projects. It is one of several smart contract projects trying to make a dent in Ethereum’s current supremacy. (Solana, Polkadot are others.)  But maybe this is just table stakes. Polosukhin has far bigger plans. “We want to hit one billion users,” says Polosukhin, who opens up about the journey that brought him from artificial intelligence (AI) to crypto, why Near is launching a “Blockchain Operating System,” and how AI once again could be part of Near’s future. Bonus? He shares why, in his view, blockchain and AI just might save humanity.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  So when you started, Near had nothing to do with blockchain.  Exactly. It’s purely AI. And as we were doing our AI thing we tried a lot of stuff, but nothing worked particularly well. We didn’t have hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware to train models on, like some companies right now. But what we did have was a crowdsourcing system.  It was a system that allowed us to find students, specifically computer science students around the world. From China, Russia, Ukraine, Poland. Countries where students are from humble means, and they do work for us for cents, pretty much. So we would need to pay them. And it was actually hard to send them money. It’s really hard to do through a traditional financial system. And that’s where the blockchain came in.  This was before the Lightning Network, before a cheap way to send transactions, right?  Yeah. The things that were around were IOTA and EOS and stuff like that. We looked at all that stuff. And we’re systems engineers. With IOTA, we actually had a way to break it. And EOS just didn’t work. EOS had a lot of great ideas and had complete utter [crap] implementation.  So we ended up brainstorming, how would we solve this problem? And we looked at Polkadot and Cosmos as well, and they're too complex. And so we thought, OK, well, we can try to solve this. And so that's how NEAR.AI became Near Protocol.  How big was the original team?  We went from three people doing AI to nine people doing blockchain in the span of a week.  Then you guys grew like crazy. What do you pinpoint as the reasons for your growth?  We did a few things very differently. For one, we talked with about 300 blockchain projects. We literally just talked with them and asked, what are the problems you have? What are the challenges to your growth? So we had a very good understanding around the product side of blockchain.  Read more: Near Protocol Starts ‘Blockchain Operating System’ to Focus on User Experience  And we actually built a developer environment first. We called it the Dev Node. And the first app on Near was built in December 2018, in an internal hackathon by our team.  Part of our team started focusing on the developer experience right away. They didn't need to wait for everything to be done. There was already an environment you could build and iterate on. We ended up implementing five different consensuses and three different charting designs. We were trying different things, implementing them and seeing how they behave.  So you could experiment and kind of throw different things at the wall and see what sticks?  Exactly. This gave us some feedback and we could improve things. We weren’t just sitting in the lab, trying to develop. We were at the conferences, in the hackathons.  Almost like beta testing.  Yeah, like proper alpha testing. We actually had people coming to our office to build on this stuff, and we gave them pizza.  What would you say was the next inflection point for your growth?  I mean, the next milestone was that we raised actual money, which was interesting timing because this was in March 2020.  Right as the world was melting down!  Yeah. Then in 2020 we started what we called the Stake Wars. This was a way to engage validators and build the validator community. A bunch of projects actually came from that interaction. We pretty much got validators to start running our code in production, getting out all the kinks. Then, in parallel, we set up what we call the guilds. These were micro-communities where we would innovate, so we kind of decentralized the community. And all of that got us into when we started running mainnet.  And then you guys went on a tear. But what has the past year been like? Realistically, what are the challenges of crypto winter?  I think kind of high-level, right? Let’s say we have $100 million in Near. If the price is $10 or if the price is $2, that makes a difference in how you allocate capital.  I’d imagine.  You cannot say it does not make a difference. It does. And so at the same time we did get a lot of momentum from all of the efforts we did. And to be honest, a bunch of them have failed since then, right? Some of the companies closed, they didn't raise money, some of our hubs actually closed as well. So it's not like 100% of everything worked out. Not everything is a unicorn.  Sure. You think of it as a portfolio of projects, right?  Yeah. It was a portfolio approach. The other thing is that we were shifting strategy. The way I look at it, the Near Foundation needs to shift strategy every six months.  That seems frequent. Why?  Part of it is because crypto's changing all the time. But also part of it is that we’re kind of going into different stages of the ecosystem, right? In the beginning, you have just the initial team that’s building stuff and nobody else.  Then you seed maybe 10 developers. They build some interesting things, but they're not yet production-ready. Then you seed entrepreneurs, and they build something that can actually raise money. Then you start seeding funds that invest into entrepreneurs. Then you start seeding a product lab to build more. So for each one you’re kind of changing.  Can you give an example?  We had a lot of brands that we were seeding [through grants], up to May. We used grants for integrations [with other projects], such as, how do we get the tax tool to integrate with Near? We need Near to be supported with tax tools so we can file taxes, for example. That’s all about building out the basics, like wallets.  Read more: Illia Polosukhin – Crypto Didn’t Fail FTX; People Did  But in the next stage it’s about bringing in use cases with real world stuff. And this is where we switch from grants to investments. The next stage is about, how do we bring enterprises [that] can actually build something for a bigger user base?  Stepping back even further, what do you see as the endgame for Near? What’s your ultimate objective?  Well, let's not say “endgame” goal, because the endgame goal is all the internet runs on Near. [Laughs.]  Okay, maybe not “endgame,” but what’s your realistic goal?  We want to hit one billion users. That’s a very concrete goal. A billion active users.  To clarify, do you mean one billion users on Near, or one billion users in Web3?  So that’s an interesting question. And this gets to something that we’ll be releasing soon. But in general, how do we give control of assets, data and power of governance to all the people?  How do we give that? So that's Web3 more in general. How do we get there? Well, we need infrastructure that can scale. We need it to be easy to use. We need it simple. We need to make sure people don't lose their money. Things don't get broken all the time. You need to solve for all that. Simple, secure, scalable. So that's part one.  Easy.  Yeah. Should be straightforward, right? [Laughs.] And you obviously need people to be building on this infrastructure. You need use cases and applications. This is why we partner with projects like SweatCoin, for example, which has 120 million installs. Right now they’re running at over 700,000 monthly active users, and they’re bringing more and more users from their Web2 user base. So that's a use case.  I’m still confused if you meant 1 billion Near users or Web3 users?  We set out to build something that's usable and enables Web3 for people. And the first part was to build a protocol, because from our perspective all the other protocols don't satisfy at least one of these three properties. [Simple, secure, scalable.] And none of them satisfy simple.  Then we built all the developer tooling. We have JavaScript. We have Rust [another programming language]. We have EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine] run as a smart contract on Near called Aurora. So you can build really complicated applications and just run it on Near. Like, you can actually run Bitcoin on Near.  OK, so that's done. Then, over the last part of the year, we started thinking about user-focused products. Then one of our core original engineers builds this really cool technology that allows you to do composable, decentralized front ends.  The idea is that you can have pieces of front ends, the source code for which is stored on a blockchain. You can compose it on the client side inside your browser on an app dynamically based on what you're looking at. This enables you to create this new presentation layer for the blockchain, a front end for a blockchain.  There's no centralized server. It all serves directly from the blockchain. It can be linked to the smart contract. It can be composed from different pieces.  This allows us to not just provide a protocol for smart contracts, but we can actually have a product for end users that we present, that has all the applications inside it. This creates easy user flows. And inside it we can build all the common features that you need, right? You have search, you have notifications, you have all of the pieces for onboarding that you need from a product side. You can have social.  What’s the timeline on this?  It's live right now.  Exciting. What’s it called?  Well, so the whole concept we’re calling the ""blockchain operating system.""  Nice branding. [Polosukhin shared more details for this at ETH Denver.]  So we’re moving away from just being a blockchain to being a blockchain operating system that allows you to kind of use any blockchain. Underneath Near you can use an Ethereum app or you can use a Canto app or whatever. So we’ll have the [Near] presentation layer, but on the back end the smart contracts can be on any chain. And then we are going to be linking everything through middleware to make the experience unified.  To bring this full circle, your career started with AI and Near started with AI and now AI is all the rage again. You must have thoughts!  AI is a really powerful force, but what we don't want is it to be controlled and biased by a single company. That's not a good thing for anyone.  What we need is some form of community coordination and governance and incentives to continue building this in the open and de-bias it over time. So what you need is neutral crowdsourcing.  How does that work?  Let’s say I’m an open AI. I dictate what needs to be crowdsourced and how this needs to be done, right? Naturally there will be biases. So we need a crowdsourcing that's on-chain. You need model architectures that are also open source, and people can collaborate on them and work together.  I’m guessing you might have a solution for this?  My co-founder, Alex, he’s actually been looking back into AI. And so in December he started a company called Yasna to focus on AI powered by blockchain. It’s using blockchain for this community coordination. We’re going to be creating a data set using these approaches for alignment of large language models, with Yasna kind of running the process.  What excites you about AI and blockchain? Why is it more than just hype?  I think AI right now will become a tool to break a lot of the current societal systems. So you can [distributed denial-of-service] the legal system with frivolous lawsuits. You can create fake candidates and try to get them elected. You can create fake companies and raise money for them.  I'm not even talking about the more sophisticated stuff. And so our plan is to organize a hackathon to get people to break all the stuff and then suggest solutions. And the reality is most of the solutions will use Web3 because you need authentication, you need identity, you need traceability, you need all those pieces embedded across the whole spectrum of our society.  What’s a quick example?  Like even like the articles you guys write, you need to have cryptographic signatures on the articles to understand that they have not been modified by somebody else. Or like me cosigning it, that you wrote the article and I agree with it. Stuff like that.  So basically the hackathon would be to ""white hat"" the problems?  We're gonna get DARPA to fund it or something like that. We'll have government support. We’re talking with a few other folks to do it in White Hat mode, but it’s almost like red-teaming.  Can’t wait to see what you cook up next.

42414061,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvUuu,1679929555,"Binance, CEO Zhao Sued by CFTC Over 'Willful Evasion' of U.S. Laws, Unregistered Crypto Derivatives Products","The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued crypto exchange Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao Monday on allegations the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law.  The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on Monday, alleged that Binance operated a derivatives trading operation in the U.S., offering trades for cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD), which the suit referred to as commodities. The suit also alleged that the company, under Zhao’s leadership, directed its employees to spoof their locations through the use of virtual private networks.  The CFTC is charging Binance with violating laws around offering futures transactions, “illegal off-exchange commodity options,” failing to register as a futures commissions merchant, designated contract market or swap execution facility, poorly supervising its business, not implementing know-your-customer or anti-money laundering processes and having a poor anti-evasion program.  The news quickly sent ripples through markets, driving bitcoin's price down by about 3% within minutes of the disclosure – though it rebounded, recovering most of the loss as the day progressed. Binance’s exchange token BNB plunged as much as 6% from its price from right before the news came out. Crypto-related stocks also fell.  According to the CFTC, the global exchange, which has a U.S. affiliate in Binance.US, created a system to hide its true reach and operations.  “Binance’s reliance on a maze of corporate entities to operate the Binance platform is deliberate; it is designed to obscure the ownership, control, and location of the Binance platform,” the filing said, adding that “Zhao answers to no one but himself.”  In a press release, CFTC Chief Counsel Gretchen Lowe called Binance’s actions “willful evasion of U.S. law,” pointing to internal chats and emails.  Moreover, the suit alleged, Binance directed customers in the U.S. to use a variety of methods to evade restrictions on U.S-based customers.  “Binance has instructed U.S. customers to evade such controls by using [virtual privacy networks] to conceal their true location,” the suit alleged. “VPNs have the effect of masking an internet user’s true IP address. VPN use by customers to access and trade on the Binance platform has been an open secret, and Binance has consistently been aware of and encouraged the use of VPNs by U.S. customers.”  The company directed important customers such as trading firms to set up shell companies in places such as Jersey, the British Virgin Islands and the Netherlands to avoid restrictions, the filing said, to escape restrictions, and was fully aware of the scale of its U.S. business.  “Binance knew that U.S. customers continued to comprise a substantial proportion of Binance’s customer base,” the filing said, citing internal monthly reports sent to Zhao, which said that, even as of June 2020 after controls had supposedly been implemented, 17.8% of customers were based in the U.S.  Without commenting on any of the specific allegations in the suit, a Binance spokesperson said the company has ""made significant investments over the past two years to ensure we do not have U.S. users active on our platform,"" including growing its compliance team from 100 to 750 people and spending $80 million on [know-your-customer] and other compliance vendors and tools.  ""The complaint filed by the CFTC is unexpected and disappointing as we have been working collaboratively with the CFTC for more than two years. Nevertheless, we intend to continue to collaborate with regulators in the U.S. and around the world. The best path forward is to protect our users and to collaborate with regulators to develop a clear, thoughtful regulatory regime,"" the spokesperson said.  The Binance spokesperson said the exchange now maintains ""country blocks for anyone who is a resident of the U.S."" and blocks ""anyone who is identified as a U.S. citizen regardless of where they live in the world."" The exchange also blocks U.S. cell phone providers and IP addresses, as well as U.S. bank accounts, the spokesperson said.  Internal chats  The filing pointed to internal chats between Binance employees, including Samuel Lim, the exchange’s chief compliance officer through January 2022 (who is also a defendant), where Lim appeared to direct an employee to ask U.S. customers to hide their location.  “On the surface we cannot be seen to have U.S. users but in reality we should get them through other creative means,” Lim allegedly said.  Nevertheless, the suit alleged the exchange was well aware that sanctioned entities and individuals from sanctioned regions were trading on its platform, sharing chat logs where Lim said that “terrorists usually send ‘small sums’” that are “barely” enough to purchase weapons with. He said other customers were “here for crime,” according to the lawsuit.  Binance directly tasked an employee to be a “Money Laundering Reporting Officer” (MLRO) to write a report claiming its compliance audit was stringent to hide how poor its compliance program actually was from business partners like Paxos, the suit alleges.  “As part of this audit, the Binance employee who held the title of Money Laundering Reporting Officer (‘MLRO’) lamented that she ‘need[ed] to write a fake annual MLRO report to Binance board of directors wtf,’” the suit said. “Lim, who was aware that Binance did not have a board of directors, nevertheless assured her, ‘yea it's fine I can get mgmt. to sign’ off on the fake report.”  The officer said in 2020 that they “HAZ NO CONFIDENCE IN OUR GEOFENCING,” the suit said.  The CFTC is asking the court to enjoin Binance from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, as well as civil monetary penalties, trading and registration bans and disgorgement.  The evidence points to Zhao and others at the company being well aware that their activities were ""subject to registration and regulatory requirements under U.S. law and that they deliberately disregarded these requirements,"" said CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson, in a statement. ""While Binance’s compliance program was ineffective in complying with the law, evidence suggests that it was quite effective at directing U.S. customers on how best to evade Binance’s access controls.""  Johnson said Congress gave the CFTC broad enforcement powers in situations like this, which she called an ""exceptional effort to orchestrate a conglomerate beyond the reach of regulation."" She said she hopes others in the industry will ""take notice"" of the CFTC action.  In response to the suit, Zhao, the founder of the exchange, tweeted “4,” referencing a previous tweet where he said that would mean to “ignore FUD, fake news, attacks, etc.”  In listing the CEO as a defendant, the suit alleges he was the “direct or indirect owner of entities that have engaged in proprietary trading activity on the Binance platform,” and was likewise the “direct or indirect owner of approximately 300 separate Binance accounts” that engaged in prop trading on the Binance trading platform.  The suit was likely expected by Binance. In February, the exchange’s chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillman, admitted Binance was being investigated by multiple regulators and expected to pay fines to “make amends” for past regulatory violations.  According to the suit, Binance employees, including Zhao, used the Signal app with an “auto-delete functionality” to communicate with each other.  The suit implied the CFTC had access to the CEO’s phone, saying it was able to collect Signal text chains and group chats from it.  Tokens as commodities  By identifying so many major tokens as commodities in the complaint, the CFTC may be staking out new ground in the jurisdictional question at the heart of the U.S. crypto sector: Who is responsible for overseeing crypto trading?  For its part, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made its view clear that most tokens are actually securities, and Chair Gary Gensler often says that every crypto token apart from bitcoin seems to fit its definition. CFTC officials have often suggested that bitcoin and ether are likely commodities, but they're additionally maintaining that litecoin and the stablecoins tether and BUSD are as well. The SEC has previously suggested that BUSD is a security in a Wells Notice sent to Paxos.  Gensler has specifically suggested that proof-of-stake tokens – a category now including ether – are securities that should be registered and regulated by the SEC. But the agency hasn’t yet pursued enforcement actions to set that view in stone, and U.S. legislation that may offer a more permanent answer is still remote.  CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam had promised last month that his agency would pursue a ""strong year of precedent-setting cases,"" and he's also been pushing for Congress to more securely set up the CFTC as a leading watchdog for crypto trading in the U.S.  After the collapse of the FTX exchange, U.S. lawmakers said they’re eager to move forward on bills to address the largely unregulated crypto sector. Some of them have been focusing specific concern on Binance.  Earlier this month, U.S. senators, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), sent a letter to Zhao calling his company ""a hotbed of illegal financial activity that has facilitated over $10 billion in payments to criminals and sanctions evaders,"" and saying it's been marked by ""increasingly disturbing allegations regarding the legality of its operations."" The lawmakers demanded information about the company, its structure and its balance sheets.  In the absence of former rival FTX, the industry has been left with a shorter list of major exchanges on which to do business, led globally by Binance. Another of the most prominent in the U.S., Coinbase, is similarly facing regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, which has warned the exchange that a significant enforcement action is likely on the way. If U.S. regulators seek to shut both Binance and Coinbase down for violating securities and commodities laws, there's little reason to expect the same accusations wouldn't be leveled at their smaller competitors for conducting the same types of activity.

On Tuesday, the European Parliament’s Economics and Civil Liberties Committees are set to vote on new anti-money laundering (AML) plans after wrangling for months about how to stop cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the metaverse being used for financial crime.  Under the current proposal, traders would be forbidden from making or accepting anonymous crypto transfers over 1,000 euros (US$1,080). If the customer's identity can be verified or if a regulated crypto provider is involved, the transaction would be allowed. The initial draft of the law was even harsher, but the text was liberalized at a March 22 internal meeting, CoinDesk understands.  Crypto transfers among private individuals – such as large payments between two friends – would still be allowed.  The legislation also bans businesses from accepting more than 7,000 euros in cash, and creates a new EU anti-money laundering agency, the AMLA.  To become law, the measures would need to be agreed upon by both the EU Parliament and the European Council, which represents the bloc's member states. The Council last year sought to ban banks and crypto providers from dealing in privacy-enhancing coins, putting the likes of zcash, monero and dash on a par with anonymous financial instruments such as bearer shares.  The parliament’s draft doesn’t appear to go that far, but it forbids anonymous crypto accounts and regards the use of privacy coins, mixers and tumblers as extra factors to take into account when assessing laundering risks.  Under the parliament’s plans, EU crypto providers would be forbidden from having a correspondent relationship with any foreign provider that is not registered or licensed anywhere. The proposals also bring NFT platforms under the scope of money laundering rules, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to the extent they are controlled by an identified person.

Talks on regulating crypto globally are set to accelerate in the runup to a mid-May gathering of financial ministers and central bankers, the report said, adding that G-7 members will state their combined efforts to toughen crypto rules in a leaders' declaration at this year's summit in Hiroshima, Japan. The G-7 members consist of the U.K., U.S., Canada, France, Japan, Italy and Germany. Japan was said to have one of the toughest crypto frameworks, with customers in FTX's ( FTT-USD ) Japanese unit being some of the first to recover funds from the failed crypto exchange. After the collapse of Bahamas-based FTX ( FTT-USD ) late last year, and more recently, the failures of Silicon Valley Bank ( SIVB ) and crypto-friendly lenders Silvergate Capital ( SI ) and Signature Bank ( SBNY ), regulators have prioritized scrutinizing the crypto industry. The banking drama has been experienced not just in the U.S., but globally, in the wake of the shotgun marriage of Swiss lenders UBS Group ( UBS ) and Credit Suisse ( CS ) as well as jitters surrounding Germany's Deutsche Bank ( DB ). While crypto rules currently vary by country, the G-7 is seeking to take the lead in creating an arguably much-needed global regulatory framework, Kyodo noted.

42414060,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvUpb,1679925600,Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta Goes Live; Ethereum’s Buterin Sends First Transaction,"Polygon, an Ethereum scaling platform, released its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) beta to the public Monday, the latest launch in what is expected to be one of 2023’s hottest blockchain trends.  Polygon also said that it is making all aspects of its zkEVM open source, so developers are able to study and share the code, allowing them to contribute to more innovations in the zero-knowledge space.  “We want to be extremely aligned to the Web3 ethos,” Sandeep Nailwal, the co-founder of Polygon, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We want more experimentation.”  As part of the ceremony of the announcement, according to the Polygon team, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, was granted the privilege of initiating the first transaction on the new zkEVM, livestreamed at ETHGlobal at 4:30 p.m. Central European Time (10:30 a.m. ET).  The transaction that Buterin sent on the zkEVM was successful, where he sent 0.005 ETH to a random address with the corny message, ostensibly referencing Neil Armstrong's famous first words upon walking on the moon: ""A few million constraints for man, unconstrained scalability for mankind.""  Over 50 companies shared that they would build using the Polygon zkEVM technology, according to Polygon’s press release.  Read more: Polygon Sets March Date for zkEVM Mainnet Beta to Go Live  The race to come out with the first zkEVMs culminated last week when Polygon’s rival, Matter Labs, opened its zkEVM, zkSync Era, to the public.  Buterin himself has promoted the development of scaling systems for Ethereum since at least 2020, and noted in a blog post in August the various versions of zkEVMs come with trade-offs – such as speed versus the degree of compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine programming environment.  ""In general, it's healthy for the space that all of these types are being explored,"" he wrote.  Although the Polygon zkEVM is live for users, Nailwal warned that it is still a new technology, which is why it is being called a beta mainnet.  “It's a new technology, so we are going to put ample warnings for the users that please be cautious on this, don't bring your life savings into it immediately,” Nailwal said.  Polygon has also previously told CoinDesk that it is exploring using Zero-Knowledge technology in its main chain, the Polygon POS chain.  Nailwal said he believes ZK technology is the future of Ethereum.  In “18 to 24 months, you will see almost all of the large web3 applications being built on the zero-knowledge-proven layer 2 chains,” Nailwal said.

Hotel by Wassies, themed after the popular ""Wassie by Wassies"" NFT collection, is located at 5 Hongkong Street in Singapore – with rooms, accessories, a cafe and amenities themed after the Platypus creatures.  It’s not an early April Fools' joke. Hotel by Wassies is a pop-up hotel that runs from March 2023 until September 2023 and is listed on various hotel booking sites.  The six-floor hotel features 55 rooms, with 49 rooms furnished in shades of Wassie-themed purple and six ""Wassies & Friends""-themed rooms that will feature art made in collaboration with other projects.  Creators say the hotel is a way to popularize the Wassie brand among the general populace. “Hotel by Wassies is a [small] Wassie step in bringing crypto culture into the real world, as we continue to look for ways to deploy the byWassies brand IP in all shapes and forms,” a regional Twitter account of the Wassie collection said.  A room at the Wassie hotel is listed for $129 as of Monday, the Wassie site shows. Wassie NFT holders can get a discount of up to 20% on room booking and 69% off drinks at Coffee by Wassies, the in-house cafe.  Floor prices of the Wassie NFT collection have jumped 20% over the past two days, surging to 0.5 ether (ETH) from Saturday’s 0.33 ether at writing time. The Ethereum-based collection has over 12,000 individual NFTs with 2,3000 unique holders, data from OpenSea shows.

42414057,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvUUN,1679922000,Franklin Templeton Sees Web3 Driving Next Wave of Tech Innovations,"Decentralization will help drive a fourth wave of technology-backed innovations, according to a new report from global asset manager Franklin Templeton. The report outlines five “megatrends” that are transforming modern society.  Franklin Templeton, a financial giant with about $1.5 trillion in assets under management, has long experimented with blockchain technology. The company has made firmer moves into the space in recent years, and announced last September plans to offer digital asset strategies to wealth managers.  “The whole reason that we've laid out the megatrends, and the reason that we think they're important to highlight, is that this set of technology innovations and the changes that they've been driving in society is what has brought us to this Web3 moment and the development of this critical crypto ecosystem,” Sandy Kaul, head of Franklin Templeton’s digital asset and industry advisory services, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Key tech-driven megatrends  The infrastructure that businesses use for their commercial activities has moved from proprietary networks to easier-to-adapt open networks, which allows for broader participation from individuals and newer businesses but puts disproportionate power in the hands of the Web2 companies that operate or facilitate the networks, according to the report. Companies have likewise moved from a focus on tangible assets to drive value to intangible assets – such as adopting new technologies to remain competitive. Those technologies have transitioned over the decades from the then-new internet to the continuing rise of decentralized solutions.  On the consumer side, these business shifts have increased the impact an individual’s voice can have on a company’s strategy, said the report. The long-valued fields of data analytics and business intelligence have pivoted to better understanding customers and enhancing their experiences and have also moved from real-time insights to predicting future behavior.  Individuals have also gained more power through the use of digital asset platforms, which have made the asset classes and complex financial products used by institutional investors more broadly available, the report continued. This is most evident in tokenized assets (both fully digital and digital versions of real-world assets) and decentralized finance (DeFi), which offers advanced trading techniques like derivatives and staking.  “For people from the traditional financial world who still are not convinced about the potential of what these new models represent, I think it's important to tie it to the history of innovation, and to the trajectory that this innovation has taken us throughout the last 60 years,” said Kaul. “This is not something that just popped up out of the blue.”  Read more: Blockchain Technology Could Be ‘Massive Disruptor’ for TradFi, Says Franklin Templeton CEO",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/27/franklin-templeton-sees-web3-driving-next-wave-of-tech-innovations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37fa599b87060f86e3c650b34fbd7b88ea51a9ce-1370x771.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has gained 69% year-to-date.  “Bitcoin trading order book liquidity is at the lowest level in a year, meaning lower volumes can drive larger price moves than before,” analysts led by Sheena Shah wrote.  Traders on Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, now set the daily price for bitcoin with its share of trading volume reaching 80%, the report said.  Issuance of the largest stablecoin, tether (USDT), has risen 10% in the last month and 16% this year, but that hasn’t been enough to offset the reduction in other stablecoins such as binance USD (BUSD) and USD coin (USDC), the note said.  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, usually the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins flows are indicative of money entering or leaving the crypto ecosystem.  Morgan Stanley noted that over half of total tether issuance – and 70% of recent issuance – is on the Tron blockchain. Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Tron founder Justin Sun and his companies for fraud. Exchanges Kraken and Binance appear to be the main recipients of the new USDT, the note added.

G-7 discussions on regulating crypto will accelerate ahead of a meeting of financial ministers and central bankers from the countries in mid-May.  Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will host this year's G-7 summit in Hiroshima. G-7 members will state their joint intentions for tougher crypto policies in a leaders' declaration, the report added.  Japan already has one of the tightest regulatory regimes for crypto, with FTX Japan customers being some of the first to get their money back from the collapsed crypto exchange.  Regulators across the world have been working toward a global consensus on regulating crypto. The Financial Stability Board, a standard setter for the global financial system, put forward recommendations for global crypto rules last October.  The risks involved with crypto were a topic of discussion at a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies last month in India. The group plans to submit a document on crypto rules at the meeting of the leaders of the G-20 nations in September in India.  Crypto has come under more scrutiny from regulators following the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX last year and the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, three banks that were either focused on crypto or had ties to it.

42414058,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvUez,1679912786,EU Smart Contract Regulations Included in Council’s Data Act Draft,"Smart contracts will have to contain a kill switch under a revision of the European Union’s Data Act published by the bloc’s member states on Monday.  The EU’s Council, which represents national governments, agreed on the text on Friday, and its proposals appear to echo those already favored by lawmakers at the European Parliament. The final wording of the law now has to be negotiated between the parliament and the council mediated by the European Commission, which is part of the EU's executive branch.  The proposed legislation requiring smart contracts to be able to interrupt or terminate their activity has provoked concerns in the blockchain community that the requirement would undermine what are supposed to be automated and unalterable programs.  Erik Slottner, the Swedish minister who served as chairman in the council's talks, said in a statement on Friday that the law will “allow data to flow freely within the EU and across sectors for the benefit of businesses, researchers, public administrations and society.”  In principle, the new rules apply to contracts that make data available as part of controls on smart-home appliances like fridges, but how far they actually go isn't clear.  Marina Markezic, a founder of the European Crypto Initiative, said it could be hard, if not impossible, for most smart contracts to meet the regulations as drafted by the parliament.  Thierry Breton, a senior commission official responsible for digital matters, has already indicated he doesn’t favor the lawmakers’ version, saying it inhibits the ability to set standards for smart contracts.

An exit scam is said to occur when developers or promoters of a crypto project seem to market a legitimate-looking project to investors, only to pull liquidity and erase their online or offline presence once a sizable amount of money has been attracted to that project.  Launched on Saturday, Kokomo Finance allowed users to trade, borrow and lend wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), ether (ETH), tether (USDT), USD coin (USDC) and dai (DAI). It quickly gained favor among Optimism users.  On Sunday night, Kokomo developers deployed an attack contract cBTC from the main address of KOKO, Kokomo’s native tokens. They then set the reward speed, paused a borrow feature and created a malicious contract to interact with the rest of the protocol, security firm CertiK said.  cBTC is a wrapped bitcoin derivative issued on the Ethereum network. The issuance of the token was ultimately used to trick the protocol into falsely believing it had more liquidity when there was none.  Another developer address was then used to maliciously approve a transfer of spending more than 7,000 sonne wrapped bitcoins, another bitcoin derivative token on Ethereum. Those tokens were then used to swap all user-supplied liquidity to Kokomo, amounting to over $4 million.  Social-media accounts and the Kokomo website were quickly deleted in the following and were inaccessible during Asian morning hours.  Meanwhile, KOKO tokens fell 97%, wiping nearly all value for holders.  The exit scam was the latest in line of a number of growing attacks and exploits in the crypto market.

42414047,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvTtE,1679898009,"First Citizens to Buy Much of Silicon Valley Bank, Assuming $72B in Loans, $56B in Deposits","CORRECTION (March 27, 12:51 UTC): Corrects to remove deal price from headline, story. Adds loans and deposit amounts assumed by First Citizens Bank.  A deal has been completed for what’s left of Silicon Valley Bank.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced late Sunday that it had closed a deal with Raleigh, N.C.-based First Citizens Bank to acquire the deposits and loans of the failed Silicon Valley Bank, an institution that catered to tech startups, including crypto firms.  Bloomberg had initially reported that a deal was nearing completion and could be announced as early as Monday morning.  In a statement, the FDIC said that all depositors of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, the bridge bank set up by the FDIC after SVB’s failure, will automatically become depositors of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co. (FCNCO). All deposits assumed by First-Citizens Bank & Trust will continue to be insured by the FDIC up to the insurance limit.  As of March 10, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank reported roughly $167 billion in assets and nearly $119 billion in deposits. Total assets acquired by First Citizens were $110.1 billion, which included $72.1 billion in loans, while liabilities assumed included $56.5 billion in deposits and $34.6 billion in other borrowings, the bank said in a presentation.  About $90 billion in securities and other assets will stay in the receivership, awaiting disposition by the FDIC, according to the statement.  The FDIC also said it has acquired equity appreciation rights for the common shares of First Citizens BancShares, the parent of First Citizens Bank, which are potentially worth up to $500 million.  Initial estimates from the FDIC say that Silicon Valley Bank’s failure cost its deposit insurance fund around $20 billion. The precise cost will be established once the FDIC concludes the receivership.  It's unclear how many former customers of Silicon Valley Bank will remain with First Citizens. Many established banks like Citigroup (C) and First Republic Bank (FRC), as well as online banks, poached Silicon Valley Bank's customers during the chaotic days after a run on the bank.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/27/first-citizens-to-buy-silicon-valley-banks-deposits-loans-in-555b-agreement-with-fdic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf1fea4c6b9db6b3971c8a64f67721d6d53bd2e3-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414085,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAvgjC,1679880078,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Is Ready for a Consolidation Phase,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin is beginning the week testing $28,000, but a consolidation at $25K is within the realm of possibility.  Insights: Decentralized derivatives platforms are short of liquidity. What's in store for them?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,231.08 +23.4 ▲ 1.9% Bitcoin (BTC) $27,966 +470.9 ▲ 1.7% Ethereum (ETH) $1,777 +32.2 ▲ 1.8% S&P 500 daily close  3,970.99 +22.3 ▲ 0.6% Gold  $1,978 −3.7 ▼ 0.2% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.38% ▼ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Happy Monday. Bitcoin is starting the Asia business day up 1.7%, just below $28K at $27,966. Ether is slightly outperforming bitcoin, beginning the day up 1.8% at $1,777.  Speaking with CoinDesk TV on Friday, Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said the success of Coinbase is dictating much of the future price movement of crypto.  “Crypto traders are closely following everything with Coinbase. ​ Coinbase CEO [Brian] Armstrong noted that they weren't entirely surprised by the [Securities and Exchange Commission Wells] Notice. No one knows how regulators are going to rule if all tokens are securities,” he said. “Coinbase's success is vital for longer-term crypto growth. In the U.S., Coinbase is a critical option for how people are getting started with crypto.”  Moya pointed out that while bitcoin has so far been unable to test the $30,000 level, it seems like it’s ready for a consolidation phase.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in an email that the market has remained largely bullish after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) pushed out a relatively tame interest rate hike.  “While we did expect a correction to $25K that didn't happen, we believe it is still in play. For now, the bulls will want to see bitcoin respecting $25K and consolidating above that level,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “Given some time with such price action, we may see altcoins starting to rally again. On the flipside, a breakdown of $25K could put the breaks on this rally.”  All the while, ether traders are breathing a side of relief – and pushing up the price – after the latest decentralized finance (DeFi) crisis, this time involving protocol Euler Finance, seems to be coming to a close.  CoinDesk reported over the weekend that the hacker behind Euler Finance’s $200 million exploit has returned the majority of the funds stolen from the protocol.  Tokens associated with layer 1 protocols such as Solana and Eos took the news favorably, beginning the Asia business day in the green.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA +4.6% Entertainment Loopring LRC +3.0% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC +2.5% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −0.8% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Decentralized Derivatives' Exchanges Liquidity Problem  Liquidity is a big concern in today’s crypto market. Without market depth, large orders create price slippage and extreme price fluctuations capsize traders.  The liquidity crisis has often been talked about in the context of bitcoin. Kaiko’s research team has flagged that a lack of fiat payment rails post-shutdown of Silvergate and Signature banks has dropped bitcoin’s liquidity to 10-month lows. But decentralized finance (DeFi) is also facing its own liquidity crunch.  One of the most interesting developments in DeFi has been decentralized derivatives exchanges (DEX). For centralized exchanges, derivatives are a much larger – and more lucrative – market than spot trading, but this comes with enhanced interest from regulators. At the same time, DEXs are far more efficient operations than their centralized counterparts, which makes them worth the regulatory risk for investors.  Perpetual futures DEX dYdX was first to the decentralized derivatives vertical, and by all accounts has done very well. But it’s not purely decentralized, combining a hybrid of a centralized order book with decentralized custody.  The collapse of FTX was a booster shot of interest; on-chain transparency is the best antidote for dishonesty and it's impossible to hide things like funds co-mingling on the open book of blockchain.  But dYdX’s competitors are running out of liquidity, leading to questions if the whole concept can scale.  On Friday, Kwenta only had $1.27 million in open interest available for long positions on bitcoin perpetuals, and $450,000 in open interest available on the short side. The situation wasn't much better for ether, with only $1.64 million in open interest available for longs.  GMX was in a better state, but has limited liquidity available for shorts, which can range from just over $1,000 up to around $700,000.  In a December report, TokenInsight flagged the issue of liquidity as being detrimental to the growth of the sector.  But this hasn’t affected everyone equally. Perpetual Protocol, another perpetual futures DEX, is still watching its open interest grow.  “I think the challenge is that there were not many new crypto traders coming to DEXs post-FTX fallout,” its co-founder, Yenwen, told CoinDesk in an email. “But I remain optimistic and believe that derivatives DEXs will become the key players for the next bull run.”  Important events  4:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:00 UTC) Germany IFO - Business Climate (March)  1:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(17:00 UTC) Bank of England's Governor Bailey Speech  5:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(21:00 UTC) Fed's Jefferson Speech  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Do Kwon Charged With Fraud by U.S. Prosecutors; Binance Temporarily Pauses Spot Trading  Federal prosecutors in New York are charging Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon with fraud after he was arrested by police in Montenegro.
