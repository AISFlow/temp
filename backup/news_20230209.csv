42412890,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6qrk,1675986579,OP Token Falls After Surprise Optimism Airdrop,"Optimism Network conducted a surprise token airdrop Thursday, sending 11.7 million governance tokens to more than 300,000 wallets, according to a blog post by the layer 2 blockchain’s caretaker group, Optimism Collective.  Optimism’s airdrop is part of the blockchain’s initiative to distribute 19% of its initial governance token supply as the blockchain forges a path toward wider adoption. Optimism distributed 5% of its initial governance token supply, or more than 200 million tokens, in its first airdrop in May.  The airdrop comes as Optimism looks for an edge over its largest competitor, Arbitrum, another Ethereum layer 2 albeit one without a token. Arbritrum currently boasts more than double the amount of transacting wallets as Optimism, widening the gap between the two exchange’s transacting wallets over the past month.  Users who spent gas executing transactions on the blockchain qualified for the airdrop. As did those who delegated the voting powers, which is imparted by the governance tokens, to other users. The Optimism Network recognizes the sharing of voting powers as a “positive sum activity” to bolster the blockchain’s governance system.  The token fell 13% on the news Optimism’s circulating supply had grown. Even so, OP has rallied nearly 200% over the past few weeks. However, following today’s airdrop announcement, the token’s price dropped 13%. At the time of publication, the token trades at roughly $2.35.  Thursday’s unannounced airdrop went off relatively smoothly, unlike Optimism’s first attempt in July 2022, when users had to manually claim their allotments. In this case, the distribution was automatic.

This analysis is an update on what to expect next. Fundamentally, Bitcoin will perform well in an environment where central banks have to choose between fighting inflation or causing a fiscal spiral in their economies. Per technicals outlined below, we need to see Bitcoin get to one more high to complete the much anticipated 5 wave pattern that tends to mark a bigger trend reversal. If we do get that last push higher, the following pullback will be where we add to our position. Two months ago, we announced that we are buying Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in the analysis : “Bitcoin is Going to Rally Again, Here’s What you Need to Know."" Here is what we said on December 9th: Though we are in the 4 th bear cycle in Bitcoin's history, the prior 3 cycles suggest where we are is a rare buying opportunity. There is ample evidence to support the $15,500 level is either a major low or very close to a major low. Both the technical and on-chain analysis support this. Due to technical analysis coupled with the on-chain analysis provided by WealthUmbrella, it became evident that we were at a major low and we alerted our followers to this important moment. Since then, Bitcoin is up 40%, and we view the next correction as potentially another moment when we may add to our position. Below, we update the new developments in Bitcoin’s price patterns as well as the on-chain metrics that we tend to see around historic lows. We will also take a look at the fundamental thesis surrounding Bitcoin’s utility, and why a globally indebted economy coupled with structural inflation will only benefit from Bitcoin. Our first sign of this problem happened when the Bank of England abandoned its fight against inflation to support its currency. This was recently followed when we saw signs that the Bank of Japan could potentially lose control of its bond market, as they started bending to inflationary pressures. It appears that central banks are being boxed into a winless corner where they have to choose between fighting inflation or causing a fiscal spiral in their economies. As these problems grow, Bitcoin’s alternative to centralized fiat system will become more attractive, which I believe is showing up in the price action. The Bank of Japan, Inflation, and Bitcoin Last month, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) surprised markets by widening their 10-year treasury bond from 0.25% to 0.50%. This may seem small, but this move roiled markets and sent ripple effects across asset classes globally, The reason the change in bond yields had a strong effect is because Japan has excessive public debt, and the concern is it will cost more for Japan to now service this debt. Most countries are dealing with high levels of debt due to a decade of negative to zero rates. However, Japan’s debt is one of the worst globally with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 262.5% . Like most central banks coming out of the Great Financial Crisis, The Bank of Japan embarked on a series of programs to combat deflationary forces. Unlike most economies, Japan’s rapidly declining population, amongst other factors, had their central banks combating deflationary forces that most of the world did not have to address. As a result, Japan decided to take central bank engineering one step further. They set a goal of reaching a 2% CPI at any cost. So, they announced a new Yield Curve Control policy. In order to maintain a yield below where the market would naturally price it, the BoJ had to sacrifice their balance sheet to achieve this goal. In brief, any bond that traded over their target, they bought. Mishtalk One of the by-products of artificially low rates in countries that issued public debt in their own currency was a very high public debt-to-GDP ratio. With rates at a persistently low level, governments were encouraged to borrow under the assumption that inflation will likely always be under control. What this means is that Japan, as well as other countries with high Debt-to-GDP ratios, cannot tolerate higher yields. The higher the yields, the more it will cost the Japanese government to service these debts. If they go too high, then the Japanese government runs the risk of defaulting on their loans. This is not a problem as long as inflation is subdued. However, like the rest of the world, Japan is now dealing with a high CPI around 3.7%, which is much higher than their target. Bloomberg So now, they appear to be approaching the end-game scenario. They have to combat inflation by raising rates, but if they raise too high, the bond market will lose confidence in Japanese debt. This is what happened in England last year when the new administration announced a sweeping spending bill coupled with tax credits in the face of a growing energy problem. In short, the bond market stopped playing ball. As debt got sold and yields climbed, this left the Bank of England no choice but to once again become the buyer of last resort, while having to deal with high inflation at the same time. If the 3 rd largest economy in the world, and second most important currency loses control of its bond market, the Bank of Japan could become one of the biggest stories in 2023. How does this tie into Bitcoin? Bitcoin is viewed as an alternative to the centralized fiat money system. Because it is not centralized, it is not prone to the results of monetary manipulation and corruption. Bitcoin is an easy and secure way out of a country’s fiat system, for better or worse. Whether one agrees or not is irrelevant. The perception that Bitcoin is an alternative is what matters, just as the perception that gold is an alternative is important, as well. The more problems that unfold with the inevitable crumbling of the global fiat money system in light of systemic inflation, the more a country will likely adopt it. We see a definite correlation between corruption and crypto adoption. This is a correlation that has persisted for years. Trustnodes The reason for this correlation is because with systemic corruption comes economic hardship, heightened inflation, and in some instances, hyper-inflation. Prior to Bitcoin, citizens have historically had no convenient way out of their country’s currency, so they have been trapped. Not all economic hardship is the result of corruption. We’ve seen global central banks embark on the greatest monetary experiment in human history, marked with countless policy errors and questionable decisions. In the U.S., we see a clear correlation between the strength of the U.S. Dollar and Bitcoin. I/O Fund When the dollar is weak, or we see the FOMC flinch in light of needing to tighten, Bitcoin catches a bid. So, clear correlations and utilities are being developed with Bitcoin that lines up with the monetary issues unfolding. We only expect this relationship to strengthen into 2023 and beyond. Structural inflation is likely here to stay, which means that global central banks will inevitably follow Japan in Yield Curve Control programs to prevent a fiscal spiral. There is simply too much debt in the system, and not enough buyers of new issues. This will only improve Bitcoin’s attractiveness. On-Chain Analysis Bitcoin does not have earnings reports. You cannot do classic fundamental analysis on this asset to help determine underlying strength. For this reason, crypto has been leaning on technical analysis predominantly, until recently. Some researchers have uncovered that Bitcoin offers its own unique form of fundamental data found on the public blockchain. This data, called on-chain data, allows us to track several patterns that can provide clues to major turning points. The following data was provided by Vincent Duchaine of WealthUmbrella, whose company has developed an automated algorithm to help retail investors navigate risk-on and risk-off environments. In the previous article , we noted that various on-chain indicators indicated that a bottom was likely: Overall, most on-chain metrics from any layers of the Bitcoin ecosystem is providing rare readings that tend to flash around major bottoms. Specifically, the indicators tracking money flow into and out of exchanges saw a peak in June 2022, which was the third highest recorded in Bitcoin history. Despite the FTX (FTT-USD) incident in November, this indicator was forming a lower high, which suggested that fear was fading. WealthUmbrella Additionally, Bitcoin’s price was within a range that we rarely see, and has historically marked major lows. What the below range is measuring is the relationship between Bitcoin’s market cap (price x the number of coins in existence) and its thermos cap (price of each coin when it was last purchased x the number of coins in existence). Bitcoin’s price was in the middle of our “value-zone” that has marked larger turning points in the past. WealthUmbrella Further evidence that a new bull cycle is developing can be seen with the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). This is calculated by examining all daily transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and determining if the coins were exchanged at a profit or loss based on the price at the last time they moved. A ratio of 1 indicates that all Bitcoins moved on a given day were sold at the same price as they were bought. A ratio over 1 means that on average people sold at a profit, and under 1 means at a loss. The SOPR signal can be noisy on a day-to-day basis, but when filtered correctly, it can be a good indicator of the current market phase. It can prematurely signal a top and may lag in signaling a new uptrend. As of last week, this signal flipped positive, and it is worth noting that it has not given any false signals throughout the history of Bitcoin, despite sometimes being late in calling an event. WealthUmbrella The above analysis is only a handful of metrics used to improve our odds at catching a new bull cycle. The final piece of evidence will come from the developing price pattern from the 2022 low. As of now, we only have 3 waves up off the recent low. We need this to get to one more high to complete the much anticipated 5 wave pattern that tends to mark a bigger trend reversal. If we do get that last push higher, the following pullback will be where we add to our position. I/O Fund In conclusion, our multifaceted analysis into Bitcoin is supporting the likelihood of a larger trend reversal. This is not confirmed from our end until we see price make that last high in the coming weeks towards the $25,600 region. Interestingly, this new bull cycle is coinciding with a weakening US Dollar. Also, it is accompanied with more central banks being boxed into inescapable corners. Structural inflation is likely here to stay, and it will not be easy for indebted countries to control this. This will only lend support to Bitcoin’s original thesis that there is no need for the trusted middle man within a peer-to-peer transaction. Centralizing our monetary system allows for corruption, and policy mistakes that can, and do, lead to 2008-style events. The deeper we go into the Central Bank monetary experiment, the more apparent it is this idea has become 15 years later.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577025-bitcoin-up-40-percent-2023-here-where-goes-next?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9153187.jpeg

42393845,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQxiJ,1675983043,Crypto Markets Analysis: Crypto Trades Lower as Regulatory Concerns Trump Encouraging Macro Signs,"“Bad” job market news that financial markets have been craving arrived, but crypto markets had other concerns.  Initial jobless claims in the U.S. rose 7% week over week to 196,000, exceeding expectations of 189,000. The higher figure represents the first increase in jobless claims in six weeks.  Counterintuitively, investors consider higher unemployment a positive thing for risker assets – crypto and otherwise.  They see a cooler employment market as an antidote for hotter inflation. Jobs data so far this year has been surprisingly positive, suggesting the U.S. economy was still expanding and that stubbornly high prices would endure.  Traditional equity markets traded higher immediately following the latest job numbers, before moderating to close lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was off more than a percentage point and the S&P 500 fared nearly the same.  Crypto markets saw no such bounce, however. One explanation could be that regulatory concerns are taking precedence over macroeconomic ones. On Thursday, crypto exchange Kraken agreed to “immediately” end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and to pay $30 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges it offered unregistered securities.  The news followed a day after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that he'd heard rumors the SEC would like to ban retail investors from engaging in cryptocurrency staking, the income-generating technique at the core of running blockchains including Ethereum.  ""I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen,"" he tweeted Wednesday.  The banning of staking would remove a source of cash for certain crypto holders, removing a valued benefit in the crypto space. The threat of this occurring bit hard into digital asset prices.  BTC’s chart has highlighted its decoupling from traditional assets so far this month, as its correlation with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell from as high as 0.77 to a current level of .44 and .36. Equity markets embraced the encouraging jobs data but crypto prices seemed weighted down by concerns about potential, new staking regulation.  To be sure, a staking ban would apply to proof-of-stake blockchains, not a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin. But the Armstrong tweet sent nearly all crypto assets plunging.  Now, it appears that crypto investors are taking more of a cautious stance than a panicked one. Trading volume remains below its 20-day moving average.

""We don't feel compelled to go out and have to do M&A but obviously if we see a good deal we'll take advantage of that,"" said Chief Financial Officer Gary Vecchiarelli on his company's fiscal first-quarter earnings conference call on Thursday. He also thinks that if bitcoin's price doesn't get close to $40,000 heading into the next halving event, there will likely be a lot of smaller miners, particularly private companies that won't be able to access the capital markets, yielding potential opportunities for CleanSpark.

""We have been thoughtful and calculated buyers in this market, seeking out accretive acquisitions and efficiently deploying capital,"" Vecchiarelli said in a statement on Thursday. ""We have been successful in sourcing and closing transactions which not only grow our percentage of the total global hash rate, but also produce meaningful bitcoin and cash flow while still paying down what little debt we have,"" he added.  Read more: Bitcoin Miner CleanSpark Buys Another Batch of Mining Machines  CleanSpark is looking to finance potential deals by selling mined bitcoins and issuing equity, management said on the earnings conference call. To that end, CEO Zach Bradford said CleanSpark will seek to raise the number of authorized shares for issuance from 100 million to 300 million at its upcoming annual meeting.  Bradford noted the move doesn't necessarily mean the company will issue any of the authorized shares, but it will give the company the option to use equity, if needed, to reach its targeted growth. ""We believe the [increased] shares would provide us the flexibility to not only maintain market share, but to substantially grow market share, just as we have in the past,"" he said on the conference call.  Additionally, CFO Vecchiarelli said the company is looking to make accretive acquisitions and has several options to do so, including selling bitcoin and equity. ""I want to emphasize that we will continue to be methodical and calculated when raising capital and deploying that capital,"" Vecchiarelli said.  The miner expects to reach its year-end hashrate, or computing power, guidance of 16 exahash per second (EH/s), according to an earnings statement on Thursday. CleanSpark previously adjusted its 2023 year-end hashrate view to 16 EH/s from 22.4 EH/s, citing a delay in building a mining facility by one of its partners, Lancium.  Overall, CleanSpark reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $27.8 million versus average analyst estimate of $29.5 million, according to FactSet data.

42412889,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6qsg,1675979817,"Russian Cybercrime Gang Trickbot Sanctioned by US, UK","The U.S. and U.K. issued joint sanctions on Thursday against seven members of the infamous Russian cybercrime group Trickbot.  Though the U.S. has previously moved against Russian cyber criminals, the Trickbot sanctions are the first of their kind for the U.K. A press release issued by the British government on Thursday said that the Trickbot sanctions were part of “the first wave of a new coordinated action against international cyber crime.”  Trickbot is a notorious Russian cybercrime gang with close ties to Russian intelligence services. According to the U.S Treasury Department, Trickbot has been coordinating its attacks to align with “Russian state objectives,” including carrying out attacks on the U.S. government. During the COVID-19 pandemic Trickbot targeted hospitals and other medical facilities with ransomware attacks.  The group’s attacks are lucrative. According to Chainalysis data, Trickbot has raked in at least $724 million in crypto, making it the second-largest cybercrime gang by profit, coming only behind North Korea’s Lazarus Group.  The members of the Trickbot group that have been sanctioned vary from senior leadership to low-level administrators. Each has been added to the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN). The sanctioned members will also have certain assets frozen and travel bans imposed.  Vitaly Kovalev, also known as “Bentley” or “Ben,” is thought to be a senior leader in the Trickbot group with a history of cybercrime that pre-dates his involvement in the gang.  Other members sanctioned include Maksim Mikhailov, a developer known as “Baget;” Valentin Karyagin, a developer known as “Globus;” Mikhail Iskritskiy, an alleged money launderer for the group known as “Tropa;” Dmitry Pleshevskiy, a coder known as “Iseldor;” Ivan Vakhromeyev, a manger known as “Mushroom;” and Valery Sedleski, an administer known as “Strix.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/09/russian-cybercrime-gang-trickbot-sanctioned-by-us-uk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb6e2f88f23875bd02ccbfd1ed164695d999872a-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412885,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6qow,1675979201,Legal Expert Says MetaBirkin Project Intended to Use Hermès’ Brand for Economic Gain,"Non-fungible token (NFT) artist Mason Rothschild was in the wrong with his MetaBirkins NFT project, Olta Andoni, general counsel at financial firm Enclave Markets, told CoinDesk TV on Thursday.  “The real intent of Mason Rothschild was to piggyback, not only on the reputation [of Hermès’], but … for his own economic benefit,” Andoni, an adjunct professor of law at the Chicago Kent College of Law, said on “First Mover.”  Earlier this week, the Paris, France-based retailer won its lawsuit against Rothschild that claimed its trademark was being diluted by the MetaBirkin project. Hermès also claimed customers would be confused by Rothschild’s project and fooled into buying virtual goods not associated with the luxury brand.  Andoni said consumer protection was one of the main concerns of the nine-person jury. Not only were they curious about the case, she said, but “they understood also that … we’re not talking only about artistic value, but we are talking a lot more about consumer confusion.”  NFTs, which can be traded and sold, give users the ability to own a digital item. However, in this case, Andoni said Rothschild intended to prop up his own brand and drive sales on the back of Hermès’ famous Birkin bags. She said Rothschild was promoting the project via his social media channels and website.  At the time of its release, the digital furry bags were priced at $450 each, about 0.1 ETH. The collection garnered $1 million in sales by January of last year before being removed from online marketplaces. Hermès filed suit against Rothschild in January 2022.  During the case, Rothschild’s counsel argued the artist's artistic expression was protected under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. Judge Jed S. Rakoff, however, denied Rothschild's motion to include testimony from art critic Blake Gopnik, who studies Andy Warhol. In a tweet Rothschild had likened his work to Warhol's famous Campbell's tomato soup can, including a copy of a letter from Campbell's admiring Warhol's artwork.  According to Andoni, Warhol’s soup cans had “a lot more artistic relevance,” adding that Rothschild's very short disclaimer about the project was not enough of an argument to keep him safe from a lawsuit.  The case is among one of the first to tackle free speech and trademark infringement. However, Adoni said the verdict won't stop some artists from doing their own NFT projects, so she expects to see similar cases in the future. Nonetheless, the verdict may prompt artists and brands to approach NFTs and the metaverse differently.  “This goes back to how much brands are interested in the metaverse, but at the same time they need to protect their IP [intellectual property],” Andoni said, adding that is what matters to brands the most.  She suggested a regulation, or “some precedent for courts,” would be helpful for artists that are making art and working with well-known brands.  “At the same time, in order for brands to truly approach the metaverse and NFTs, we have to understand that laws are going to be applicable to NFTs as well,” she said. “Just because you're creating this digital art doesn't mean that no consumer protection laws are applicable there.”  Read more: Hermès Wins Trademark Lawsuit Against MetaBirkins NFTs, Setting Powerful Precedent for NFT Creators",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/09/legal-expert-says-metabirkin-project-intended-to-use-hermes-brand-for-economic-gain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1165db92b59a6ddf953e7eac3f17ae72d099b41e-1008x717.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411223,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMDKQ,1675978649,Setting the Record Straight,"Editor's note: CoinDesk has reprinted Aronow's letter in its entirety as it was provided, except for minor edits for profanity and grammar.  It’s been a surreal couple of weeks for me. For those who don’t know, after a year of ignoring some pretty scary symptoms, my doctor called to tell me that the results of some extensive testing revealed I have heart failure. I learned that typically means a person has a 50% chance of living five more years. I asked my doctor what I should do, and besides telling me I need to go to see the best cardiologist we can find she said it was time to radically change my life.  So that’s what I immediately started doing. I’ve left most of my responsibilities at Yuga in good hands, while still giving myself room to advise as much as I’m able. I’m scheduled to see some great cardiologists and am working with some integrative specialists who are going to walk me through everything from supplements to pretty intensive therapies and a major diet overhaul. I am radically changing my life.  My goal this week was to just reintegrate with the natural world. I’ve been hyper-caffeinated, working 12 hours a day, helping run a successful business from behind a computer screen for two years straight. Stepping away from it felt like getting off the world’s longest roller coaster. I went and sat on the beach with my partner and dog to clear my head. Just as we got back my cell rang. It was an old friend in California whom I hadn’t spoken to in a long time.  He said, “Dude, what the f**ck, I just read you’re dying.”  I said, “Oh, you saw my tweet thread?”  He said, “No. It was included in an article that came across my feed. It was all about claims that you guys are Nazis. What the f**ck is going on?”  That’s something I’ve asked myself a lot the last year: What the f**ck is going on?  I’m unfortunately no stranger to conspiracies. When I was a kid my father was murdered. He was an offshore powerboat builder and world-champion racer. Due to his high-profile lifestyle, the wildness of the 1980s in Miami, and the fact that his case was unsolved for years, a lot of conspiracy theories started circulating around him. Books were written about those theories. Documentaries were made. Rambling, incoherent websites went up. Even after the hitman and the man who hired him were arrested and imprisoned, crackpots kept inventing stranger and stranger lies. Kids at school would say, “I heard your dad was smuggling drugs for the CIA?” or “I heard your dad worked for the cartels and was killed by the mob?” It went on for years like that. Every time I’d tell my mother she would say, “The truth will come out in time.”  As if a testament to how little the truth has won during the three decades since, a couple of years ago John Travolta played my father in a motion picture explicitly based on one of those conspiracy books. It was heartbreaking to my mother.  Unpacking the insanity of “What the f**k is going on?” and the wild conspiracy theory that we’re orchestrating some super-secret Nazi troll, which has already been debunked by the ADL [Anti-Defamation League], is really not how I saw my first week of healing going. But that’s exactly what I’m going to do, because two things have become clear to me:  1. I’m never going to be able to let this go and heal until I set the record straight.  2. The truth doesn’t come out by itself.  So what the f**k is going on?  I’ll start off by saying that we’ve already publicly shown these allegations are simply lies. Some of my co-founders have even testified under oath to the true facts. Anyone who thinks we’re only refuting these lies in just a letter is wrong. Everything I’m writing here is verifiable and true, and I will soon call out this utter bulls**t under oath, too.  Over the past year, my co-founders and I have been the subject of a conspiracy that we’re supposedly secret, alt-right, esoteric, Nazi pedophiles who encoded secret Nazi messages on behalf of several extremely fringe alt-right or far-right internet groups.  According to the conspiracy, we intentionally included obscure references to [Adolf] Hitler in the BAYC collection – apparently the bunny ears trait and the Bored Ape Kennel Club refer to the Hitler bunny ears meme and the fact that Hitler liked dogs, that the alligators in the swamp are references to Hitler’s pet alligator named Saturn, that the cyborg eyes trait refers to a Cyborg Hitler meme, that the astronaut suit trait is a reference to a Space Hitler meme, that the baby bonnet trait is a reference to a meme about Hitler’s childhood, that the DMT trait and the Trippy fur trait are references to a meme about Hitler tripping on acid, that the dresses in the collection are references to a meme about Hitler liking to cross-dress, and that an ape playing the banjo in the background of the Rolling Stones cover we did is a reference to a meme about Hitler playing the banjo, and the fact that we held an event in Miami, our hometown, was somehow a reference to Hitler’s yacht being sunk off the coast of Miami.  I could keep going, but I think you get the idea.  But these lies don’t just live on the internet. We’ve received death threats on multiple occasions, even just yesterday. We’ve had people show up at our houses. This must stop.  Debunking the bulls**t  For starters, give me a f**king break. All four co-founders, including myself, are almost comically liberal. We have all previously donated and voted exclusively to and for progressive candidates, for years. (I voted for Bernie [Sanders when he ran for president], twice. In fact, my second date with my partner of four years was to one of his rallies.) You can type our full names here and look up our donation histories for yourselves.  Secondly, I’m an Ashkenazi Jew by heritage. (You can see on my father’s Wikipedia page that he was the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants.) And my co-founders are all children of immigrants: Greg is a first-generation Cuban-American. Kerem is a first-generation Turkish-American. Zeshan is a first-generation Guatemalan-Pakistani.  Despite facing all these absurd allegations and being in the public eye for over a year, not a single person who has ever known me or any of my co-founders has corroborated these bogus claims.  Do you know what I’ve always found super ironic? In an interview I gave in 2014 to the Chicago Tribune, long before starting Yuga, which was about novels I liked and disliked, I explicitly s**t on Hitler. The conspiracy theorists don’t like to mention it much, though.  The two items that are the focus of the most frequent lies: our company name, Yuga Labs, and the BAYC Logo. I’ll dive deep into both of those here, but first, let me debunk some of the other claims.  Bored Apes:  BAYC was created as an homage to the energy and excitement of Crypto Twitter. Early crypto and NFT (non-fungible token) adopters were worth millions, yet showcased fun anime or animal profile pictures on Twitter. Instead of f**cking off to the south of France with their newly made fortune, they were up late posting memes and looking for people to play League of Legends with. They were bored. It was an absolutely fascinating culture to encounter when we first did in 2017. And like the retail stock traders of Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets, many crypto traders thought of themselves as “apes.” To ""ape"" meant to go apes**t and buy something without any due diligence. Ape, as in, “I just aped into this s**tcoin.”  It’s one of the reasons why in CryptoPunks, one of the earliest and most beloved NFT collections, the apes are some of the rarest and most valuable NFTs in the whole set. For the same reason, AMC Theaters recently named a new stock dividend: APE.  So we came up with the idea of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, with the “Yacht Club” being set as a decrepit swamp bar in the Everglades. It was our way of showing that this was meant to be fun and irreverent, and a jab at the culture of shilling cryptocurrencies that would “go to the moon” and enable everyone to get lambos and … yachts.  And as for the apes themselves, we worked to create a diverse set of 170 mixing and matching traits, with everything from punk leather jackets and Guayaberas to vintage military gear to prom dresses and rainbow suspenders. We wanted to evoke the countercultures we grew up admiring: 1980s hardcore punk, 1990s hip hop and Warhol’s 1969 Factory parties where you’d see bankers hanging out with leather daddies and outlaw bikers all while the Velvet Underground played.  The collection was intended to be irreverent and punk rock, but was never intended to offend anyone – and it's certainly not part of an elaborate alt-right trolling campaign. That being said, if even ONE person has been offended by the art, I want you to know that was never our intent. And we always have been open to good faith feedback if the collection offends someone.  A good example of this is when we launched the Bored Ape Kennel Club charity ""adoption drive"" over a year ago. The initial collection included a Rising Sun Flag. We had seen the flag in Street Fighter, saw that the flag was still being used in Japan today, and wanted to pay homage to the origins of the Shiba Inu. However, we were not aware of the weight that the flag holds for a large portion of the Asian community. So we owned up to this error and provided an option for the community to switch the trait post-mint (statement from 6/28/2021 below).  Sushi Chef headband:  At the time of launching BAYC, SushiSwap was a popular decentralized exchange (or DEX). We liked the idea of including an homage to the DEX in the form of one of our traits, and so we created the ""Sushi Chef Headband."" Honestly, we just googled it quickly for reference on this. We certainly weren’t trying to reference any obscure alt-right memes. These hachimaki are worn all over the world. We’ve been told that the version in our collection says ""Divine Wind,"" which is the same as what Kamikaze pilots wore. This headband has become a part of pop culture and is still sold and worn today. It wasn’t intended to offend anyone or be some secret code to fascism.  Hawaiian shirts:  It’s claimed the Hawaiian shirt in the collection (again, one of 170 possible traits) is a reference to far/alt-right morons called Boogaloos who go to rallies with semi-automatic weapons and Hawaiian shirts. That group literally never crossed our minds when selecting the Hawaiian shirts. The Hawaiian shirt in our collection is one of the first Hawaiian shirts that pop up when you google “Hawaiian shirt.” Why? Because it’s the Hawaiian shirt Tom Selleck wore in ""Magnum PI,"" and thus probably one of the most famous Hawaiian shirts of all time. All for canceling the man because nobody should have a mustache that glorious, but give me a break. It’s a “Yacht Club” and we think it looks great as a clothing trait.  Names:  It’s claimed our pseudonyms were intentionally crafted to be obscure racist references. That is categorically false.  Emperor Tomato Ketchup – It’s a super popular Stereolab album (Pitchfork ranked it 51st of the decade) and Kerem is a mega-nerdy vinyl record collector, as literally anyone who knows him will attest. His love of collecting vinyl has been referenced on our homepage since day one. He did not know it was also a reference to some controversial and experimental 1970s Japanese art film, and had never heard of that film before all this bulls**t started. Everyone just calls him “Tomato.”  Gargamel – Greg likes Starcraft. Smurfs are a thing in Starcraft. This is also literally referenced on our homepage from day one. When we were launching BAYC, he found out his wife had never seen the show Smurfs before, so they started watching it together. Also, has Hank Azaria been canceled for playing Gargamel in the 2011 live-action Smurfs film? If so, nobody told us. And also, this is Greg. (He gave me permission to post this.) Let the man own a self-effacing joke about being short and bald without being called a Nazi.  GordonGoner – The claims go that my name was intentionally an anagram for “drongo negro.” I, like everyone else I’ve ever met, had never heard of the Australian slang word ""drongo"" before. If you Google it, nearly every reference is to it being a type of bird. The claims go that this is a popular alt-right phrase on 4chan. Except, someone did the research and discovered those two words had never been used together on 4chan before the conspiracy began. I liked GordonGoner because I was extremely sick for 10 years (which I talk about more in detail here) and thought of myself as a ""goner."" I liked that it sounded like a classic punk rock sobriquet, like Sid Vicious or Johnny Rotten or Joey Ramone.  No Sass – It’s been claimed that Sass is some kind of abbreviated amalgamation reference to two (sometimes three?) separate Nazi things. This one kind of leaves me speechless in its absurdity. I was just sassy as f**ck the morning we were choosing our names and Zeshan picked the name as a joke.  Cute bonus pic of all of us at Zeshan’s wedding last year. Also evidence I am a giant.  Prussian helmet:  It’s been claimed that the Prussian hat variable in the collection is a reference to Nazis. Except: The ADL has already rebuffed this claim and a senior fellow said, “Imperial Germany is two governments before the Nazis” and “other Imperial German images, like the Pickelhaube, are not at all associated with Nazis.” We didn’t include it in the collection as some kind of obscure reference to the alt/far-right. There’s even a modern-day garage rock album by King Khan and BBQ Show, where Khan, a Canadian-Indian man, wears a helmet on the cover.  If the hat looks pretty familiar to you, it might be because that’s the album cover for one of the most popular TikTok songs of all time, with over 20 million views. All videos using the song have the album cover in the lower left-hand corner. As well, many countries still use this helmet, including Chile, Portugal, Colombia, Sweden, Jordan, the U.K. and more. The helmet is a trait in the BAYC collection for the same reason there’s an S&M hat or Soviet Ushanka or Army Hat or Fez or Caesar's laurel wreath or a Vietnam helmet or Beanie or Captain’s Hat: we thought they looked iconic and kind of punk rock. Probably the same reason Khan wears it.  Ana Montes:  This one is truly bizarre. The claim is that Greg’s aunt is some infamous Cuban spy. How that relates to Nazism I’m unclear. Except, oh wait, this one isn’t true either! Not his aunt. We have no idea who this lady is.  A bad Koda name:  More recently, someone raised concern about a trait name in the Otherdeed NFT collection as being offensive. There’s a trait on a Koda (little creatures who live in Otherside) titled “Stone Hole Jackson.” This is one of over 1,000 uniquely named traits in the collection and was named by a Yuga staff writer (not a founder.) We had at first understood this as a reference to Jackson Hole, Wyoming: There are “holes” in the Koda, as you can see in the image below, and this type of Koda was meant to exist on the Sulfuric lands. The thinking went – sulfur, geysers, holes, Jackson Hole. It’s important to note that every trait in the collection underwent several rounds of review by multiple sensitivity readers, and no one caught it. It wasn’t until the collection was revealed that someone pointed out that this trait could also refer to the Civil War general Stonewall Jackson, which we realized it was obviously also referencing in hindsight. So when we updated the provenance of the collection, we renamed the trait to simply “Stone Holes.”  Cowabunga:  The conspiracy theory correlates Greg’s wife using the phrase “Cowabunga” in her Instagram bio as some kind of source of proof she’s also a Neo-Nazi, because apparently Cowabunga has ALSO been co-opted by some fringe alt-right internet groups. For the record: Cowabunga was popularized by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Greg’s wife is a Mexican-American woman who is also extremely liberal. To quote Greg, with her permission, “She cried when Al Gore lost [the U.S. presidential election in 2000] when she was 9.”  Puzzles:  It’s been claimed that the answers to the puzzles in our Treasure Hunt game last year were somehow secret neo-Nazi codes. But that ignores that blatantly obvious fact that every puzzle answer was a monkey or ape pun: Guenon is the name of a monkey species, Aperol has APE in the name, etc. To even pull the puzzles off we had to bring in a pro. We are way too dumb to solve complex puzzles, let alone make them. A company called Exaltation of Larks put the whole thing together and the guy behind it, Greg Pliska, is a brilliant and amazing puzzle maker. None of the founders could have made or solved those puzzles. The claim that this puzzle was somehow another example of hidden messages in our work has been debunked before, the partner we worked with confirmed that we didn’t have anything to do with the answers. After we made a statement about it in the last letter, here is what the puzzle-maker said on Twitter:  BAYC 'patch' logo:  We've been accused of drawing inspiration for our patch variation logo from a Nazi emblem and that we gave the Bored Ape skull 18 teeth as an obscure reference to Hitler. This is emphatically false. We have or will repeat this fact under oath.  When the ADL spoke about this subject in February 2022, it said that there was no connection between the BAYC patch logo and the Totenkopf Nazi icon. But the conspiracy theory ignores this fact and points to the “motorcycle patch” layout as ""proof"" that we intentionally referenced the Nazi emblem (and are therefore secret Neo-Nazis).  Why did we choose an ape skull? It’s called the “Bored Ape Yacht Club,” and we liked the idea that the apes were “Bored to Death.” In fact, that phrase is something we used on some of our merch designs.  To accept the conspiracy theory, you’d have to ignore that the layout is nearly identical to tens of thousands of other motorcycle club patch logos, and similar to many other punk rock-inspired lockups and maritime patches. The below examples were not hard to find, and there are literally about a thousand others we could have included:  In our previous post, I shared the email that served as the initial creative brief for our logo designer. Here are the different options she came back with given the direction we’d supplied, dated 03/30/21:  You can see an early version of the circular patch logo here, along with an alternate version that shows it more like a poker chip. We ended up digging the simpler version without the poker chip lines – this was meant to be a punk dive bar in the swamp, and this version of the patch logo felt punk rock enough (like The Misfits logo). It also felt crusty and old-school, like something out of a swampy motorcycle club. Most motorcycle clubs will have an “MC” on one side of the logo, so you can see how we ended up with BA and YC on each side. This simple Google search of “motorcycle club logos” may be helpful for anyone unfamiliar with this standard design layout.  The freelance designer who worked on the logos said the following in an email recapping the process:  “You'll see that there are a number of different circular 'patch' designs. I ended up going with the layout that you have today since 1) it felt the cleanest/most legible and, 2) it's a pretty standard lockup in the design community, meaning it was easy to put together and we were on such a crunched timeline for this project (y'all wanted everything in like 2 days lol). I added the roughened effect around the edges simply because I didn't want it to feel too clean.”  Emphasis on the phrase “...standard lockup in the design community.”  And just to show how insanely popular this lockup is, here are two examples I randomly spotted in Whole Foods. If you just start looking around your hometown for design layouts that look identical, you’ll start seeing it everywhere.  Kali Yuga  Let’s start with this: Go ahead and Google the term Kali Yuga and read about what it means for yourself.  One of the recurring claims is that our name is a reference to two fringe alt-right internet groups that have appropriated and co-opted the Sanskrit Hindu term “Kali Yuga.”  None of the founders had ever heard of those groups before these conspiracy theories started and, like most people, we never knew the term Kali Yuga was being used by ANY hate group, however fringe. ""Yuga"" roughly translates to ""era"" in Sanskrit. We are building a company for a new ""era"" of the internet: Web3. It’s also the name of a Zelda character that turns things into 2D art, which is exactly what our business does.  Quick history lesson from someone who has been part of or adjacent to Hinduism for over 20 years: Kali Yuga is an ancient Sanskrit term denoting the fourth of the Yuga cycles, and the cycle we are currently in for the next 400,000 years or so. There are three other Yugas: Krita, Treta and Dvapra. This is an important aspect of Hindu cosmology as each Yuga has very different characteristics and methods for spiritual development.  Let me be clear: Neither Yuga nor Kali Yuga is a term of hate. At the time of my writing this, the Kali Yuga Wikipedia page doesn’t even find its connection to fringe alt-right internet groups relevant enough to mention it. (I’m sure trolls will attempt to edit the wiki asap.) That’s how obscure the term’s connection to hate groups actually is. Kali Yuga is believed to be an era where it’s difficult to perform our Dharma (spiritual duty) due to increased conflict and strife. The common belief is that most spiritual methods no longer work in this era. But it’s also a very beautiful era, because in the Kali Yuga, many Vedic scholars believe we have one method that is extremely effective: Bhakti, or loving devotion. It’s sad that some fringe alt-right groups have tried co-opting a term with such a profound religious significance.  And if you ask one of the billion Hindus in the world what these terms mean, they would tell you just that. (And they might be just as surprised and offended as I am by the co-opting of its meaning by internet trolls.) But if you ask those who attack us, we named our company Yuga Labs because of an obscure phrase from some now-defunct alt-right Telegram group.  I became familiar with the terms “Yuga” and “Kali Yuga” as part of my journey within Hinduism. I grew up right next door to a Hindu temple, hanging with the monks and chanting the Mahamantra with my Tulsi bead mala my brother gave me when I was nine, and discussing the Bhagavad Gita with them. (There was even an influential Krishnacore punk scene and that music meant a lot to me growing up.) I’ve understood the Hindu concept of Kali Yuga for over 20 years. One of my best friends of 20 years was a Hindu monk. Hindu philosophical concepts such as Karma, Dharma, Samsara, Moksha, Yugas, Gunas, Vedanta, the four Yogas, Ahimsa (non-violence) and so on are concepts I talk to my friends about; my spiritual practice is something I take seriously.  As anyone who knows me would attest, this stuff is a huge part of my private life and has been for many years. I’m not claiming to be an Orthodox Hindu; I’m a secular guy who gravitated towards Buddhism as I’ve gotten older. My spiritual beliefs have become more personal and less dogmatic as I’ve matured. For instance, despite being vegetarian for many years out of a sense of religious duty, I eat meat now, because I believe it’s good for my health (on top of heart failure, I also have a serious bowel disease I’m frequently hospitalized for, and without meat, I simply waste away.)  As ridiculously invasive as it is for me to feel I need to prove my personal spiritual beliefs, here’s a screenshot of a receipt for a Hindu worship ritual called a puja, which I donated to be performed at the Sri Sri Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir (Temple) in India back in 2017.  Now, I’ve actually sponsored countless Hindu pujas (rituals) and donated thousands of dollars towards yajnas (fire rituals) for Brahmin priests to perform in India over the years. These pujas have been such a recurring spiritual practice for me over the last decade, that I’ve even begun learning to perform simple yajnas myself at home. But this particular puja I’m screenshotting has a special meaning, so I thought it was appropriate: Narasimha (sometimes referred to as Nrisimha) is the “protector of devotees” and it is the common belief that he is very ferocious with non-devotees. So, all in all, it’d be an absurdly f**cking bizarre thing for me to sponsor back in 2017 if I didn’t actually believe in it, and certainly not something someone using Kali Yuga in some ironic neo-Nazi way would have done.  Again, I’ll say all of this under oath.  Oddly enough, Greg proposed Yuga as the company name. He knew the word Yuga meant something to me. We had discussed Kali Yuga as a spiritual principle many times before, and he knew the Sanskrit word Yuga means “era” and that we were going to create things for a new era of the internet (Web3). Add to that the Zelda character named Yuga who can turn people in 2D art. And the fact that the name just sounded very f****** cool and unique. Despite all these insane allegations, we still love the name and the rich meaning behind it.  Now, at some point, the conspiracies focused on this Kali Yuga stuff because my entire old, deactivated and deleted Twitter account was published. This had “Kali Yuga” as the location tag and the Wheel of Samsara as its header image (a spiritual representation of the transmigration of the soul). Again, stuff I genuinely believe in.  As evidence of that, you can go ahead and read literally every single tweet from that account here. You’ll see that I supported Bernie Sanders (and tweeted about my support for him 91 times), I supported AOC [U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], and I supported Nina Turner [who ran for secretary of state in Ohio]. I made anti-racist tweets, mocked those who got upset that Confederate statues were being torn down, and mocked racists who were bullying [Nascar driver] Bubba Wallace. You’ll see horrible crypto price predictions from years ago, and that I can be cringe. You’ll see that I’m human. You’ll see I had opinions and flippant thoughts on s**t you might disagree with, like for instance, how much I disliked [Donald] Trump and [Joe] Biden, and that I liked listening to Joe Rogan’s podcast (I’ve been pretty open about how I’ve done DMT and other hallucinogens.) You’ll see that I liked talking about fiction and movies and cracking jokes. You’ll see that I liked Buddhist/Hindu spiritual memes. In general, you’ll see that I am basically the antithesis of everything the conspiracy theory is about, so much that after reading all about the conspiracy theory, one even had to publicly admit I must not be a neo-Nazi, stating “He’s a died (sic) in the wool leftie. Not right-leaning at all, including alt-right.” Taken as a whole, I think it’s blatantly obvious I held leftist views that are the polar opposite of far/alt-right assholes.  Another point I’d like to make: Sometimes these allegations reference that we didn’t mention the Sanskrit ""Yuga means Era"" meaning behind our name until much later, that at first we simply highlighted the Zelda reference. The answer to that is simple: We were being attacked for months with the allegation that ""Kali Yuga"" was only some kind of co-opted term associated with obscure internet hate groups.  The western world doesn’t, by and large, know the term at all, let alone the authentic meaning of the term. And we were being accused of all kinds of crazy s**t. We felt overwhelmed by it all. So we debunked the claims in the page-long document we shared above, because any more at the time felt like giving the conspiracy way more attention than it deserved. Debunking claims made about Kali Yuga would have required me to explain my entire spiritual background and give a crash course on the Yuga cycles, which, ironically, is exactly what I feel compelled to do now.  Our logic was that any sane human being would have accepted the fact that I’m Jewish by heritage and that my co-founders are all children of immigrants, and that should have been enough evidence that we weren’t secret Neo-Nazis. How wrong we were!  The sad reality to all of this is that ANY personal information about us gets twisted into some sick and bizarre ""seven degrees of Hitler"" by conspiracy theorists. Despite all I have written here to set the record straight, someone is going to twist and turn everything I’ve written here and try to use it against us. Likely, a reporter or two will as well, at least that’s been our experience. We’re fully prepared for that. We have been constantly attacked for over a year and it’s thickened our skin. I do, oddly enough, feel sad for those who seem to only have this conspiracy as their reason for being. It sounds like a dark and miserable way to live.  Last point: If you think I’m a deeply left-leaning person, deeply into Hinduism and Buddhism for years, but somehow would want to troll people with obscure and fringe alt/far-right secret coded messages, I think you have a f**cking screw loose.  Back to healing  So that’s about it. I'm not a Nazi. I have heart failure. I look like a giant in photos.  I get that a lot of the broader world doesn’t understand crypto or NFTs. I get the skepticism. There are a lot of bad actors in the space and the recent collapse of FTX makes the industry look like a f**cking cesspit of phonies. But whether you choose to believe it or not: we’ve done everything straight up. Whether you dig NFTs or not: we run an honest company and built an honest product that a lot of diverse people from all over the world love.  These aren’t all people who bought an NFT to flip it for a quick buck. They bought them because they believe in the principles of Web3 and crypto and fell in love with their digital identity and what it meant to be part of a tribe, especially when the world was a lonelier place and people were trapped inside their homes.  And even if you disagree with all that and just want to mock NFTs anyway, fine. Or maybe you find something personally problematic in the artwork and want to have an honest conversation about that, fine. But we, our families, and our employees didn’t deserve this absurd year-long campaign of conspiracy theories, lies and harassment, and we don’t deserve journalists smearing our names all in service of the same.  Over the past two years, despite everything we were going through, despite my health tanking to the point where I may only have a few years left to live, and all the hard work that went into the products and events we created, we still managed to do a lot of good for the world. In just our first months we raised over a million dollars for animal charities. Later we donated a million to Ukraine at the outset of the war. We pledged 6.25% of Yuga Labs’ holdings of ApeCoin to the Jane Goodall Legacy Foundation, which at the time of writing has a value of $52 million. We’re also in the throes of our $1 million pledge to the Miami community to support arts and education for our hometown. I’m proud of the work we have done and the impact we’ve had on the NFT industry and I believe Yuga will continue to be at the forefront of the metaverse for many years to come.  I'm well aware that talking about all this shows how exasperated we’ve been at different points, it’s embarrassing and exposing, but I want to end by saying that the overwhelming feeling I have these days is gratitude. When we started Yuga, we knew we had a great idea, and we knew there was a community of people out there who would respond to this idea, but what it has become has exceeded even our wildest dreams. While I certainly wish I had taken better care of myself during this ride, I am so proud of what Yuga continues to build and the ambition it’s pursuing to shape the metaverse and beyond. I’m also incredibly grateful for the people I was able to meet along the way. The other day, when I announced my heart condition, thousands of people wrote to me: thanking me, wishing me well and offering support. You cannot imagine how much that meant to me. The passionate, creative and positive Web3 community will remain part of my life even in this new chapter.  But now that I’ve set the record straight on this I need to log off and get back to taking care of my health.

42411216,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCxH,1675977845,How to Avoid the Death of DeFi in the Wake of FTX,"Decentralized finance (or DeFi) is characterized by speed, autonomy and transparency unmatched by legacy banking institutions. The financial crises of the past half-century, brought about by opacity, obfuscation, inefficiency and excessive human meddling, clearly justify these innovations.  Yet, as evident by numerous crypto scandals in the last year – most notably the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange – the industry hasn’t been able to lean into DeFi’s inherent advantages. While decentralized trustless technology is revolutionary, we watched as the industry was being run by centralized organizations like FTX, which are far more susceptible to fraud at the hands of corrupt leadership.  Brent Xu is the CEO and co-founder of Umee.  The uncomfortable truth is that to build lasting value, DeFi and blockchain need real-world use cases. Without a value proposition beyond “line-go-up,” it's difficult to justify DeFi’s innovations. Blockchain just becomes an overly complex mechanism for classic casino capitalism. It’s no wonder profit-minded investors ignore the nerdy tech and instead flock to the slickest snake oil salesman.  Ultimately, the way to end fraud and criminality in the crypto space is to give DeFi a clear and justifiable use case. To this end, the industry needs to take some cues from the traditional banking sector.  Why does traditional finance work?  Traditional finance gets a fair amount of criticism – and rightfully so. The greed and irresponsibility of some in the banking sector has created massive economic injustice. That said, not all criticism of the finance industry is warranted. While the disgruntled and the nihilistic think of the financial sector as nothing more than a cynical money-making operation, this sentiment – while understandable – fails to capture just how critical the financial sector is for a functioning society and humanity’s well-being.  Take a minute to consider your setting. Are you in your home? If so, think about how you purchased it. Did you take out a loan? If so, where did this loan come from? Presumably it came from a bank, which in turn sourced the funds from its depositors – workers and institutions active in the real economy. If it wasn’t for the bank’s fundamental linkage to the value-creating people and companies responsible for a functioning economy, its lending system could not be sustained and the loan which financed your home may never have happened.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez - DeFi Is the Way Forward, but It Needs to Evolve  By balancing incentives for lenders and borrowers, the financial sector is able to both contribute to – and benefit from – productivity in the real economy. Consequently, the supply and demand dynamics that shape society, and the financial institutions that operate within it, are inseparable.  DeFi’s value proposition  At the moment, no one is buying a home with blockchain loans. Municipalities aren’t funding infrastructure development with crypto. Corporations aren’t financing mergers and acquisitions with lending decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). All of this begs the question: From where does DeFi derive its value?  The truth is that the basic value proposition of crypto - as it is currently constituted - is unsustainable and, arguably, Ponzinomic. “Line-go-up” isn’t a genius financial strategy when the only thing underpinning this view is the expectation of exponential growth. While advocates of the status quo point to the use of increasingly complex strategies within the DeFi space, the truth remains that DeFi can generate long term value only when people - and money - enter the space from the “real” economy.  As we’ve seen the number of DeFi users stagnate, and its total value locked decline, it is clear that widespread popular adoption isn’t happening on its own. Without a fundamental raison d'etre, DeFi looks less like a financial revolution and more like a pyramid scheme. To build lasting value, DeFi needs to focus on economic integration, not selling steak knives. We will not see sustained DeFi growth until markets see blockchain as a system compatible with the requirements of real world economics  Making DeFi work in the real economy  While it is clear that DeFi needs real-world use cases, it is less clear how exactly to create them. However, a necessary first step is to completely transform how DeFi conducts risk assessment. It is no secret that people are dissuaded from DeFi because of its association with financially risky activities.  For example, the borrowing and lending facilitated by Celsius Network and other discredited lenders was conducted with the purpose of placing directional bets on the price of various crypto assets. These lenders had no arbitrage strategy and the interest rates these lenders charged – which, under a functioning financial system, would have accounted for risk, were essentially arbitrary.  Read more: What Is DeFi?  The solution to this freewheeling “YOLO lending” is to create objective risk assessment mechanisms. For example, traditional finance (TradFi) uses yield curves based on “risk-free” U.S Treasury debt to assess the systemic risk in the bond markets at any given time. A DeFi-native version of a yield curve would be able to assess the risk inherent across a protocol. Similarly, blockchain debt rating tools, functioning in a similar manner to those from Moody’s or Fitch, could assess the risk profile of any one lender and rate the integrity of blockchain debt. Without the foundations of a credit system or the financial infrastructure and plumbing to service lending markets, DeFi debt markets have nowhere to grow.  While not sufficient, these tools would mitigate industry fears about DeFi’s purported instability. By laying the ground for objectively derived and sustainable interest rates, DeFi protocols would be able to provide the predictability necessary to facilitate real world lending, and in turn, real-world use cases.  DeFi’s speed, autonomy and transparency would greatly benefit a number of financial subsectors, from mortgages to corporate M&A to countless other enterprise use cases. However, these are not sufficient attributes in and of themselves to align DeFi with the requirements of mainstream finance. Instead, the DeFi industry needs to demonstrate its maturity by taking the concerns of mainstream institutions seriously. Failure to do so will only exacerbate DeFi’s decline.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET,Brent Xu,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/09/how-to-avoid-the-death-of-defi-in-the-wake-of-ftx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/664267fea0607fb8e29db3d86284f99d1bdeb8cc-4288x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The LDO governance token of Lido Finance, the largest liquid staking protocol with some $8.4 billion of staked ether (ETH) on the platform, jumped 10.4% in an hour, according to data by CoinGecko. Competitor Rocket Pool’s RPL jumped 7.3%. Smaller liquid staking platform’s tokens such as Persistence’s pSTAKE and StaFi’s FIS gained 6.7 and 11.4%, respectively.  Prices have more recently pared some of their earlier gains.  The rally served as a counterweight to Thursday's downturn in the broader crypto market. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), that tracks the price of a basket of cryptocurrencies, decreased 2.2% in an hour. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are both in the red in the past 24 hours, with much of their declines occurring in the last three hours.  Staking is the consensus mechanism to validate transactions for proof-of-stake blockchains, including Ethereum, which also offers a way for investors to earn yield on their digital asset holdings. However, the SEC has been vocal about its concerns that staking services are the equivalent of unregistered securities according to present regulations.  The settlement between Kraken and the SEC might be a boon for decentralized rivals to grab market share from centralized service providers. Some of the largest centralized exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase and Kraken, let users stake cryptocurrencies and earn yield as a service on their platforms and have been popular staking providers. Staking on centralized exchanges takes up about 28% of all staked ether, data by Dune Analytics shows.

However, an ongoing investigation by a state regulator suggests the company, which received a provisional bank charter from the OCC in 2021, is indeed under closer scrutiny than its peers may be.  Paxos also holds a virtual currency license – commonly referred to as BitLicenses – issued by NYDFS.  A Paxos spokesperson did not return a request for comment by press time.  NYDFS published stablecoin guidance in June, directing issuers to ensure their stablecoins be fully backed with assets segregated from the issuers’ funds and attested to regularly.  The guidance, which was issued in the wake of the collapse of the terraUSD/luna stablecoin ecosystem, is focused on asset-backed stablecoins. NYDFS had been working on the guidance since prior to the collapse, Superintendent Adrienne Harris told CoinDesk at the time.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/09/stablecoin-issuer-paxos-is-being-investigated-by-new-york-regulator,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eb0094bdb1885e34e3b59ebf859d2001168b315-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388113,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR5FuD,1675975534,Bitcoin Drops Below $22K as Kraken Agreement to Close US Crypto Staking Operations Spooks Investors,"Bitcoin dipped below $22,000 Thursday and was recently down nearly 4% over the past 24 hours amid a wider market decline that largely followed news that crypto exchange giant Kraken had agreed to shut its U.S. cryptocurrency staking operations to settle charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The SEC said later Kraken will “immediately” end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and pay $30 million to settle SEC charges it offered unregistered securities.  Bitcoin was recently trading at $21,900. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, followed BTC’s trend, recently trading down 4.3% to $1,569.  Crypto-related stocks also struggled with Coinbase recently falling 14% during Thursday’s midday trading hours, bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) dropping 13%, MicroStrategy (MSTR), a major bitcoin acquirer, down 10%.  The Kraken news followed less than a day after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted his crypto exchange company had heard “rumors” the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wanted” to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers. Armstrong’s tweet prompted a slow late Wednesday-early Thursday decline that sent BTC from its previous support just below $23,000 to about $22,500. A number of analysts have been concerned about this possible development.  “It remains to be seen if these rumors are true, but what is clear is it would be a huge mistake from a U.S. perspective, as it would result in the rest of the world getting ahead in the important crypto and blockchain technology revolution,” Marcus Sotiriou, market analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an emailed comment.  Several believe BTC will retreat to $20,000 support in the near future as investors also fret over stubbornly strong jobs data and an extended continuation of hawkish U.S. monetary policy that will hamstring economic growth. But others say the current lull will be temporary and segue into another price surge, similar to trends in earlier years as markets emerged from other bear markets.  “What we are experiencing now seems more similar to the up and then sideways market activity that pretty much defined all of 2019,” which followed a severe price crash, Emurgo Managing Director Vineeth Bhuvanagiri wrote in a note to CoinDesk. Bhuvanagiri wrote that markets had entered “not only a recovery but an accumulation phase” that ultimately helped feed the 2020 bull run.  “I think we’re more likely in a 2019 scenario than an actual bull market,” he added.  Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of crypto lending platform Ledn, said in an interview with CoinDesk that while short liquidations typically fuel price increases, a recent absence of BTC short liquidations suggested there “might be more sideway trading left.”  Data from crypto data platform Coinglass showed that investors had liquidated some $90 million in BTC long positions compared to around $42 million in BTC short positions over the past seven days.  ""There's modest leverage being taken both to the downside and the upside,” Bartolomeo said. “Typically what creates those violent moves is leveraged. So right now I think the setup is just trading sideways for the near term.""  BTC plummeted about 60% in 2022 but regained lost ground during a triumphant January. Recent market indicators such as “movement of large amounts of BTC from centralized exchanges to self-custodial wallets,” and “the growth of daily active addresses and transactions” suggest ""a potential market bottom"" and ""a persistence of long-term investor confidence,"" according to Messari's latest quarterly report on bitcoin.  ""Although the hype surrounding bitcoin has diminished, the network has historically experienced a resurgence in popularity after periods of doubt,"" Messari’s Sami Kassab and Chris Collar wrote in the report.

Read more: Kraken Agreed to Shutter Crypto-Staking Operations to Settle SEC Charges: Source  Payward Ventures, Inc. and Payward Trading Ltd., the registered companies that make up Kraken, will end staking services and programs, the SEC said. The programs offered the general public access to staking services since at least 2019.  “The complaint alleges that Kraken touts that its staking investment program offers an easy-to-use platform and benefits that derive from Kraken’s efforts on behalf of investors, including Kraken’s strategies to obtain regular investment returns and payouts,” the SEC release said.  In a blog post, Kraken said it would automatically unstake any assets staked by U.S. clients except for staked ether, which won't be unstaked until after the Ethereum Network's Shanghai upgrade takes effect. U.S. clients will also be unable to stake new assets (including ether). Non-U.S. clients are unaffected.  The SEC filed its lawsuit in federal court on Thursday.  While Kraken’s website offered a 20% yield on its staking service, the SEC press release suggested it may be as high as 21%.

Many crypto stakers loan their tokens to service providers who run the nodes, and share in the returns.

In particular, Article 68 poses a threat to the privacy and security of individuals, businesses, communities and nations.  According to MiCA Article 68, the rules for operating a trading platform for crypto assets must prevent the trading of crypto assets with built-in anonymization unless the holders of the assets and their transaction history can be identified by authorized crypto-asset service providers.  Gary Weinstein is the head of global regulatory relations at Electric Coin Company.  This language could have a detrimental impact on the growth and innovation of the blockchain industry, as well as the privacy and security of individuals, businesses and communities.  It is important for regulators to understand that the blockchain industry is still in its early stages of development and that a one-size-fits-all regulatory approach may not be the best solution. Instead, a more flexible and dynamic approach is needed that allows for the continued growth and innovation of the blockchain industry while still ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and protecting the privacy and security of all stakeholders.  To address this issue, we might consider alternative options to allow crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) to continue facilitating confidential transactions while still ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Rather than suggesting a specific technical solution, regulators should allow for regulated intermediaries to have the flexibility to consider their own risk-based solutions that balance the need for compliance with the need for innovation and privacy.  Additionally, together with EU regulators, we might consider the development of regulatory technical standards to provide more guidance on the implementation of MiCA Article 68.  Finding a solution to the challenges presented by MiCA Article 68 will require coordination and collaboration. By engaging in open dialogue and gathering input and feedback from industry leaders and experts, EU regulators can gain a better understanding of the potential implications of the regulation on the blockchain industry and the privacy and security of individuals, businesses and communities.  See also: Why Crypto Should Support the American Data Privacy and Protection Act | Opinion  Privacy is a cornerstone of human rights. It allows us to communicate freely and securely, without fear of surveillance or retaliation. And, without private encrypted transactions, our financial transactions are exposed to hackers. When individuals are able to conduct transactions confidentially, malicious actors are thwarted from tracking and targeting them. Also, businesses can conduct confidential transactions and protect sensitive information from competitors and malicious actors.  By considering alternative compliance options, developing regulatory technical standards and engaging with industry experts and stakeholders, we can work towards implementing MiCA Article 68 in a way that promotes growth and innovation in the blockchain industry while protecting the privacy and security of all stakeholders.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TRADING,Gary Weinstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/09/blockchain-privacy-is-at-risk-in-the-eu,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3ed8a073c2dda43db7fc42abffba045fe741886-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC voted on the settlement during a closed-door commissioner meeting on Thursday afternoon, and an announcement may come later in the day, the industry person told CoinDesk.  A Kraken spokesperson declined to comment. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment after the publication of this article.  The SEC confirmed Kraken would shut down its staking services for U.S. customers after the publication of this article.  Kraken offers a number of services under its staking umbrella, including a crypto-lending product offering up to 24% yield. This is also expected to shut down under the settlement, the industry person said.  Kraken’s staking service offered a 20% APY, promising to send customers staking rewards twice per week, according to its website.  Bloomberg reported that Kraken was close to a settlement with the SEC over offering unregistered securities on Wednesday.  The vote comes a day after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that he’d heard rumors the SEC would bar retail customers from engaging in staking, the technique of pledging crypto tokens to run blockchains such as Ethereum. The SEC declined to comment on Armstrong’s comments on Wednesday night. Coinbase offers its own staking services.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously said he believes staking through intermediaries – like Kraken – may meet the requirements of the Howey Test, a decades-old U.S. Supreme Court case commonly used as one measure of whether something can be defined as a security under U.S. laws.  Staking looks similar to lending, Gensler said at the time. The SEC has brought and settled charges with lending companies before, such as now-bankrupt lender BlockFi.  A Kraken settlement would help Gensler’s mission, giving his agency a big win as it continues its efforts to police the broader crypto ecosystem. The majority of people staking on Ethereum, for example, use services, according to Dune Analytics.  Crypto markets fell after the publication of this article, with Ethereum, a coin secured by a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, falling 4.5% within 30 minutes.  Danny Nelson contributed reporting.

42411202,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCJb,1675968985,Crypto Would Survive an SEC Crackdown on Staking,"On Wednesday Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong went public with ""rumors"" about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) working to “get rid of” retail-focused crypto staking offerings. If concerning, the scuttlebutt isn’t new: SEC Chair Gary Gensler took the moment of Ethereum’s historic “Merge” to a proof-of-stake system to call the yield-generating practice into question, much as he’s drawn a line around the entire token economy. Also, in August news broke the securities regulator was probing Coinbase specifically over its staking services.  Staking, the process of locking native blockchain tokens to secure the network and receive rewards, has become a major business line for centralized exchanges looking to diversify their revenue streams away from transaction fees. Coinbase is the second-largest staker on Ethereum, even as competitors such as Kraken and Binance have moved into the business. In many ways, if the SEC is successful in banning staking programs, decentralized alternatives like Lido and RocketPool, the largest and third-largest Ethereum-based platforms by value, will benefit.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The SEC cannot block users from posting 32 ether (ETH) to become an Ethereum validator, or from pledging coins to other hosts, even if the regulator can put serious restrictions around the activity for crypto economy on-ramps like Coinbase. That message seems to have moved the market: Lido’s governance token has surged following tweets from Armstong and Coinbase itself. As my colleague Sam Reynolds put it: “As a decentralized protocol, it's unlikely [Lido] will have the same compliance with securities rules as a U.S.-domiciled centralized entity like Coinbase.”  If the SEC does move to restrict staking, I’d expect for the crypto industry to put up a major legal challenge – much in the way diverse participants collaborated to prevent U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration’s eleventh-hour ban on “unhosted wallets.” In just a few years, staking has gone from a theoretical security mechanism to the backbone of many high-valued blockchains – comprising about a quarter of the crypto industry’s market cap. And while Armstrong may be a bit bold in calling staking a “national security” interest, it is a growing economic activity regularly tracked by firms like JPMorgan.  For all I know, the SEC could be right in saying that staking – which incentivizes people to secure a crypto network through payments – does satisfy the “Howey Test” to determine if an asset is a security. But that shouldn’t be up to the SEC to decide alone. It’s also worth noting that staking is not really like “crypto lending,” which requires exchanges to seek yield to pay to depositors, such as the shuttered Gemini “Earn” platform or Coinbase’s DOA offering the SEC shut down. Staking has its risks – protocols could be compromised, companies can cheat – but it’s part of an open-source process baked into a blockchain’s security, making it far less risky than rehypothecation-driven yield programs.  See also: Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking? | Learn  All that said, the recent staking rumors seem to be part of a widespread crackdown against the crypto industry. As venture capitalist Nic Carter wrote, nearly every financial watchdog seems to be working towards detaching crypto from the real economy – in particular by using the private banking sector as a cudgel. If this speculation is true, what Carter deemed “Operation Choke Point 2.0” after the Obama-era campaign to de-bank legal but morally dubious businesses, crypto has bigger problems at hand.

The NFT collection minted on the Bitcoin-native Ordinals Protocol, sold out its mint earlier this month and features 100 NFTs in the style of NFT behemoth Yuga Labs’ CryptoPunks collection, which is built on Ethereum.  Ordinals Protocol utilizes Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade, an improvement to secure the network and more efficiently facilitate transactions. It stores NFTs through inscriptions, a method of “inscribing” data in satoshis, or sats, which represent one hundred millionth of one bitcoin.  The NFTs comprising the Ordinal Punks collection were minted on the first 650 inscriptions of the Bitcoin network.  The concept of Bitcoin NFTs has caused a heated debate within the dominant blockchain’s community. Some purists believe the blockchain should be limited to financial transactions, while others point to the Ordinal Protocol’s popularity as a positive catalyst that will fuel more development on the blockchain.  Sam Callahan, Bitcoin analyst at financial services company Swan Bitcoin, told CoinDesk that while the popularity of Ordinal Punks will drive demand for block space, miner revenue and eventually Taproot adoption, it doesn’t come without risks.  “In the long term, if demand for these inscriptions proves to be long lasting, there is a risk that these inscriptions could impact other Bitcoin use cases like payments via the Lightning Network due to distorting Bitcoin’s fee market away from its use as an open monetary protocol,” said Callahan.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/02/09/bitcoin-punks-ordinal-nft-collection-soars-in-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/971904344c4d0898a1fbe240376e1e46bdac925e-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The proposal, if ultimately accepted by U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, would end the nearly two-week-long spat between federal prosecutors and Bankman-Fried’s lawyers over his bail conditions.  Issues with Bankman-Fried’s bail conditions became public on Jan. 27, when prosecutors submitted a letter to the court urging Kaplan to amend Bankman-Fried’s bail conditions to prohibit him from attempting to contact any former or current employees of Alameda Research or FTX, as well as using Signal or other ephemeral messaging applications.  In their letter, prosecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried had already attempted to reach out to at least one potential witness in the case – identified as Ryne Miller, the current general counsel for FTX US – to allegedly attempt to influence his future witness testimony. Prosecutors also said that discovery in the case had been impeded by Bankman-Fried’s habit of using self-deleting messaging applications.  Kaplan tentatively agreed to modify Bankman-Fried’s bail conditions to meet the prosecution’s requests, but Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s attorney, pushed back. In a separate filing, Cohen argued that Bankman-Fried needed to contact certain current and former employees, including FTX’s in-house therapist, George Lerner, for “personal support.”  On Feb. 6, Cohen filed a letter with the court telling Kaplan that an agreement had been reached with federal prosecutors on a list of former employees acceptable for Bankman-Fried to communicate with, and certain apps, including iMessage and Zoom, that were acceptable for Bankman-Fried to use.  The next day, however, Kaplan rejected the proffered agreement.  During Thursday’s hearing, Kaplan requested a written list of former and current employees with whom Bankman-Fried would be allowed to communicate. Kaplan also said he was concerned about Bankman-Fried’s ability to encrypt his messages or otherwise evade surveillance under the current terms of the joint agreement, leading to his lawyers’ proposal that he install monitoring software on his phone.  “I mean, I think I know what ‘encrypted’ means,” Kaplan said. “I’ve read all the spy novels, too.”  In addition to reading spy novels, Kaplan said he’d spent the prior evening reading up on a recently discovered trove of letters written by Mary, Queen of Scots during her imprisonment.

Chainlink Automation will run specific tasks, including price updates, liquidity balancing for the DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) and debt ceiling upgrades for assets held as collateral, according to the press release.  “This network of automated bots perform essential tasks to maintain the Maker protocol and will be greatly expanded through the integration with Chainlink’s renowned, hyper-reliable automation platform,” Nadia Álvarez, a member of MakerDAO’s Growth Core Unit, said in a statement.  Maker is an automated crypto lender with some $7 billion of assets pledged on the platform, which also issues the $5 billion DAI stablecoin. A decentralized autonomous organization governs the protocol by proposals and votings, and holders of the maker (MKR) governance token can support or oppose decisions.  The community approved the move in an executive vote that concluded Thursday 03:23 UTC. The integration will be available for execution on Saturday, MakerDAO's voting page shows.  The decision comes as Chainlink has become a deeply embedded software platform, also known as oracle, in the Web3 ecosystem to feed blockchain networks with external data from the real world. It has built wide-ranging partnerships with crypto firms and traditional companies, including telecom giant Deutsche Telekom and interbank communication provider SWIFT.  “The advancement of the technology backing stablecoins is a necessary component to unlock the future of finance,” said Johann Eid, vice president of Go-To-Market at Chainlink Labs, the developer firm behind Chainlink. “As more and more traditional financial institutions partner with MakerDAO and assess the applicability of DeFi, the required underlying infrastructure becomes increasingly complex,” he said about the integration.  LINK, Chainlink’s native token, has been one of the top daily performers among digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), gaining some 8% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.

42411242,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKtw,1675961538,The Future of Financial Planning Lies in AI and Blockchain,"The integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in financial planning and portfolio construction holds immense potential for efficiency, accuracy and security in the industry.  The use of blockchain and AI in this field could revolutionize the way financial advisors build portfolios and manage client information.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Financial planning  In the field of financial planning, the integration of AI and blockchain technology could provide a much-needed upgrade. AI algorithms could analyze vast amounts of data to assist in making informed decisions regarding investments, taxes and insurance.  The algorithms could make real-time adjustments to financial plans, automate updates to plans based on changing legislation and reduce the risk of errors and fraudulent activities – all in a matter of seconds. This would lead to more efficient and accurate financial plans, freeing up time for financial advisors to focus on providing personalized advice and improving client relationships.  By utilizing the secure and transparent platform provided by blockchain, AI algorithms could also analyze and securely store sensitive financial information such as Social Security income information and tax information. This could allow for faster and more accurate calculations, potentially leading to financial plans that automatically adapt in real time without the need for manual updates.  Read more: Here’s Why Artificial Intelligence Focused Cryptocurrencies Are Vastly Outperforming Bitcoin  Portfolio construction  Traditionally, portfolios have consisted of a mix of stocks, bonds, cash and sometimes a few alternative investments. However, with the advent of non-fungible tokens, the future of portfolio construction could be changing.  NFTs allow for the fractional ownership and sale of any asset through smart contracts stored on a blockchain, potentially enabling portfolios to hold unique assets such as music albums, real estate, direct-held businesses, watches and artwork.  These new investment opportunities would allow clients of financial advisors to not only own unique assets, but to generate income from them in various ways.  Through NFT staking, a process in which holders lock up their NFT assets on a platform or protocol, clients could earn rewards for holding onto their assets and helping secure a network.  Owning unique NFT assets that represent actual assets can also lead to passive income streams, such as rental income or royalty payments.  By fractionally selling assets through NFTs, clients have the opportunity to liquidate fractions of holdings and receive lump sums of cash – a process which, previously, may not have been possible with certain assets.  All of this opens up new possibilities for investment and brings us closer to a future where the average person's portfolio may resemble that of a hedge fund or venture capital fund. By exploring these cutting-edge technologies, financial planners and investors alike may be able to create a more diverse and secure investment portfolio with an extremely wide array of assets.  Watch: How AI Could Shape the Future of the NFT Market  Estate planning  Estate planning involves the creation and implementation of a plan for the transfer of assets after death or while alive but incapacitated. It’s often a painful and expensive process that can be hard to implement properly.  With the integration of blockchain and AI in estate planning, smart contracts could be used to create, monitor and implement estate plans, potentially reducing the risk of processing problems. The use of AI algorithms in estate planning could provide real-time updates on changes in assets, the law and the market, allowing for a more accurate and up-to-date estate plan.  Smart contracts on the blockchain could automate the distribution of assets and ensure they are allocated according to the wishes of the individual, without the risk of fraud or human error. Blockchain could also ensure that all estate-related information and transactions are secure, reducing the risk of data breaches.  Human vs. technology debate  For decades, the financial advisory business has remained largely unchanged. However, these cutting-edge technologies are set to revolutionize the industry and have for years sparked a human vs. technology debate in the realm of financial advice.  The incorporation of AI and blockchain technologies into the financial industry will automate many routine and complex tasks, freeing financial advisors to focus on higher-value activities that require their unique skills and expertise.  Despite these advancements, the human element of financial advice will remain critical. Clients seek not only knowledgeable financial advice but also a personal touch, and financial advisors who understand the human behind the client will continue to be in high demand.  Read more: Crypto AI Needs a Showcase to Know What's Real  Preparing for the future  Going forward, financial advisors will need to be proactive in their preparation to effectively incorporate AI and blockchain technologies into their practice. They will need to pay attention to not only the possible implementations of the technology but also to regulation of them and how that will affect their practice.  This means financial advisors will need to stay informed and educated about the latest advancements and developments in AI and blockchain technology and make any necessary updates to their processes to stay ahead of the curve.  Equally important, advisors must educate their clients on the benefits and implications of these new technologies, working together with them to develop plans that leverage their investments. By staying ahead of the curve, financial advisors and their clients can reap the benefits of these new technologies while ensuring their financial plans remain effective, efficient and secure.  As the financial industry evolves and technologies evolve, the role of the human financial advisor will become no less important. The personalized touch that technology simply cannot replicate will never be replaced.

42410838,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1b4,1675960602,Bitcoin Miners Surface for Air as Sliding Natural Gas Price Provides Cost Relief,"Bitcoin miners, who have been battered by the recent bear market and high energy prices for months, are finally getting some relief thanks to natural gas prices that have fallen about 75% since August. Crypto prices, meanwhile have rebounded.  Miners use copious amounts of energy, and their profitability greatly depends on their ability to consistently source cheap power. Many industrial-scale miners rely on power grids that generate electricity using natural gas, and don’t have fixed-rate energy purchase agreements, exposing them to the whims of energy markets.  “2022 proved how vulnerable those miners are to global fuel price inflation,” said Jaran Mellerud, analyst at mining services firm Luxor Technologies.  Many of these miners suffered heavy losses because natural gas prices soared on sanctions imposed on Russia after last year’s invasion of Ukraine, plus the price of bitcoin plummeting in 2022, hitting a two-year low in November.  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  Firms responsible for more than 1 gigawatt of hosting capacity entered bankruptcy protection as a result of the 41-year high in power prices last year, said cryptocurrency-focused financial services firm Galaxy Digital in a report last month. Hosting firms that offered fixed-rate contracts to their customers were particularly exposed to the variability of energy markets, and some of them ended up paying more for their service than they were bringing in.  The high-profile companies to file for bankruptcy last year in the mining industry, Core Scientific (CORZ) and Compute North, had large third-party hosting businesses.  However, all that might be changing.  Natural gas – which accounts for about 32% of U.S. energy consumption, according to the Energy Information Administration – has fallen about 75% to $2.44 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. By comparison, in August 2022 the price was around $9 per million British thermal units, according to CNBC data.  Demand has been lower than anticipated due to an unusually warm winter in Europe, among other things contributing to the lower price. Meanwhile, bitcoin rallied about 40% in price in January.  This environment has had a “positive impact” on bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation’s (GREE) operations, particularly its natural gas plant in upstate New York, said the company’s chief strategy officer, Scott MacKenzie.  Read more: Bitcoin Miner Greenidge Generation Restructures Another $11M of Debt  The price of natural gas is expected to stay low in the short to medium term, providing some wiggle room for the miners to lower their operating costs, according to some industry participants.  “Absent another big surprise (such as the Ukraine war), we do not expect natural gas prices to return to their recent peak of over $9,” said Alex Stoewer, chief operating officer at Digital Power Optimization, a company that helps power producers balance electricity loads using different solutions. “December 2025 Henry Hub futures are currently at $4.50, with summer prices in the mid-$3s.”  The impact of lower natural gas prices and higher bitcoin prices is starting to show up in the global hashrate, a measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network, according to investment bank DA Davidson.  “The improved [mining] economics have encouraged less-efficient operators to re-engage, sending network competition to new highs,” analyst Chris Brendler wrote in a Jan. 30 research note. The hashrate will stay high in Brendler’s estimation, particularly given the drop in natural gas prices.  Renewed partnerships  At the height of last year’s war-induced natural gas rally, demand for power increased sharply as the U.S. saw its third-hottest summer on record.  This meant that not only prices for grid-hooked miners were sky-high, but energy producers and utilities could sell their power to other industries at massive profits, thus barely striking any new deals with the miners.  Read more: A Huge Glut of Bitcoin Mining Rigs Is Sitting Unused in Boxes  As natural gas prices come down in 2023 and mining economics improve, the case for mining bitcoin is becoming lucrative – for both miners and energy firms.  “New [mining] deployments are benefiting significantly from this by raising capital to build bitcoin mines and forming new partnerships with gas owners,” said Luxor Technologies Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera.  Galaxy said that partnerships between the two industries are mutually beneficial as “miners can secure lower energy prices and energy providers can have a guaranteed off-taker of energy to monetize excess energy.”  The impact of natural gas fluctuations is a stark reminder that ensuring energy costs can stay low in the long term is more important than flocking to an ultra-low-cost short term opportunity.  “The past year shows that miners are better off fixing the long cost of power, as opposed to flocking to areas where energy prices are cheap, but variable,” said Sergii Gerasymovych, founder and CEO of mining firm EZ Blockchain.

The stablecoin issuer said it held zero commercial paper -- a type of unsecured, short-term debt -- as part of its commitment to back USDT with more secure reserves such as U.S. Treasury bills, according to an attestation report completed by accounting firm BDO. In addition, the company noted a $300M reduction in its secured loans, in line with another recent pledge to wind down its lending business throughout 2023. Tether and other companies that issue stablecoins have come under increased scrutiny in the months following the multibillion-dollar collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD ( UST-USD ). In December 2022, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler questioned crypto firms' proof-of-reserve reports, which seek to show customers they have adequate funds to back customers' deposits. The problem with such reports is they are ""neither a full accounting of the assets and liability of a company, nor does it satisfy segregation of customer funds under the securities laws,"" Gensler said. As of Dec. 31, 2022, Tether had at least $67.04B in total assets against total liabilities of $66.08B, the report showed. Almost all of the liabilities related to digital tokens issued.

The funding will go toward furthering the DMC format and accelerating development of an open-source Vault protocol, according to a press release.  Founded by Nigel Eccles and Rob Jones, Vault’s DMC is a sort of non-fungible token (NFT) for music fans, offering authenticated digital box sets and unique experiences. The Vault protocol aims to be an open, decentralized standard for purchasing, playing and sharing DMCs through third-party apps.  In October Vault partnered with musician FLETCHER to allow fans to influence the setlist for each night of her tour. Fans were able to choose between four DMC-backed “Dream Sequence” setlists and the winner was performed that night. The tour also included other DMC content, including behind-the-scenes footage. Other artists planning DMC-related content include singer-songwriter Naika and musicians SUM SUN.  “Given their success in founding FanDuel, the team at Vault understands the power of engaged communities and the importance of consumer-friendly design,” said Placeholder VC partner Chris Burniske in a press release. “Their vision to create an open, protocol-agnostic format has the potential to transform digital music and media ownership, and playability across physical and virtual worlds. We are excited to support the team’s efforts to bring Vault technology to fan ecosystems within the broader music and media industries.”  Other investors in the round included AlleyCorp, Bullpen Capital and Everblue Management.

Other responsibilities would include handling blogs and social media that would be designed to reach policymakers.  The job would be based full time in Brussels, unlike many other Binance positions that can be done remotely. The location would allow access to officials from the European Commission and European Parliament responsible for proposing and agreeing to new laws that could affect the crypto sector.  The EU is set to formalize its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in April, which would impose consumer protection and financial stability norms on wallet providers and exchanges. Further laws could be set to come in other areas such as crypto lending and decentralized finance (DeFi).  Binance is registered in a number of EU countries including France, Italy and Cyprus, and is already a member of Brussels-based umbrella lobbying organization Blockchain for Europe.

42388104,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR5FE7,1675951200,Aave Deploys Native Stablecoin GHO on Ethereum Testnet,"Aave, one of crypto’s largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, has deployed its native stablecoin GHO on Ethereum’s Goerli testnet, Aave Companies, one of the firms that develops the lending protocol, said Thursday.  Developers and potential adopters of GHO, pronounced as “go,” can access the stablecoin’s codebase and test how it works before being released to the wider public on the Ethereum blockchain, a press release said.  GHO’s mainnet start is subject to community discussion and approval.  Aave is a lending and borrowing platform that allows users to take out crypto loans or earn yields on their tokens using smart contracts, without third-party oversight. It is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization, Aave DAO, through proposals and community votes.  The protocol's native stablecoin has been highly anticipated among DeFi users since the community overwhelmingly supported its development in August in a governance vote.  Read more: DeFi Lender Aave Deploys Version 3 on Ethereum Network  Stablecoins are a novel group of cryptocurrencies whose value is backed by an outside asset and aims to keep its price linked to a currency such as the U.S. dollar. The asset class has become the backbone of the crypto ecosystem by facilitating trading and transfers between the traditional currencies and digital assets. It has grown to a total market capitalization of $136 billion.  Aave’s GHO will face fierce competition as a slew of rival decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols issue or are in the process of crafting their own native stablecoin as a means to attract users at a time when crypto lending is flagging. Currently, DeFi lender Maker’s DAI is the largest decentralized stablecoin, with a $5 billion circulation, while Curve, another top protocol, is inching toward launching its native crvUSD stablecoin.  Still, Aave's top position within DeFi with some $7 billion worth of digital assets pledged on the platform may give its stablecoin a jump-start.  “I suspect GHO will soon be a top decentralized stablecoin behind DAI,” Dustin Teander, analyst at crypto intelligence firm Messari, told CoinDesk. “However, given that the demand for debt is currently fairly low in DeFi, it could take some time to see significant expansion.”  How Aave’s GHO works  GHO will be an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by crypto assets, according to a technical paper authored by Emilio Frangella and Steven Valeri from Aave Companies. Its price will be fixed with an oracle to $1.  The supply of GHO is controlled via a mint-and-burn mechanism. Aave creates (mints) GHO tokens when users deposit digital assets as collateral to borrow GHO, while they keep earning a yield on their underlying assets.  When users repay the principal loan, Aave destroys (burns) the previously issued GHO reducing its circulation and returns the underlying collateral.  Those who stake the protocol’s AAVE governance token, may borrow GHO at a discounted rate.  ""This adds an incentive to staking AAVE and could result in short-term increase in staked AAVE depending on the interest and discount rates,"" Teander added. ""In the long run, if the discount is valuable enough it could be a viable incentive to move away from dilutive token emissions for attracting capital.""  Aave DAO will be responsible for determining the token’s supply, interest rate and risk parameters. The DAO will receive all interest fees during the GHO loan period, a clear distinction from lending and borrowing all other digital assets on Aave.  GHO will rely on so-called facilitators such as other DeFi protocols that will be able to trustlessly mint and burn GHO tokens. They must be approved by Aave’s governance and respect an upper limit for borrowing called a bucket.  Prior to the testnet release, the GHO deployment was audited by blockchain code auditing firms Open Zeppelin, SigmaPrime and ABDK, and it is currently under audit by Certora, the press release said. The protocol also started a Bug Bounty program which encourages community members to discover and report security vulnerabilities for up to $250,000 reward.

42410851,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs288,1675948761,Darknet Revenues Fell After Hydra’s Shutdown: Chainalysis,"Shutdown of the once-dominant darknet marketplace Hydra in 2022 changed the market for drugs and other illicit goods. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, blockchain data shows many of the darknet vendors quickly switched from Hydra to another marketplace, OMG!OMG!, the firm said in a new report.  The wallets that previously interacted with Hydra started transacting with OMG!OMG! wallets, and since then more than half of OMG!OMG! revenue would come from former Hydra clients, Chainalysis said. This might be a sign that Hydra operators have been involved in OMG!OMG!, too.  The two platforms also shared the same method of drug delivery: Buyers received geographic coordinates for the packages they bought, which had been hidden in parks and other locations in advance.  After Hydra  Hydra used to be the most successful marketplace for drugs, counterfeit documents, money laundering and other illegal goods and services in the world, although its users were mostly in Russia and neighboring countries. The platform offered crypto cash-out services and even announced an initial coin offering (ICO) of its own token in 2019, but that never happened.  In April 2022, the U.S. included Hydra’s crypto wallets into its sanctions list. German law enforcement shut down the platform and seized 543 bitcoin in its wallets, worth about $25 million.  Several competitors picked up the slack after Hydra: OMG!OMG!, Blacksprut and Mega Darknet Market. All three used the same bunch of deposit addresses at a “high-risk exchange with a heavy presence in Russia,” Chainalsysis said.  Another blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs, earlier said that in the eight months since Hydra’s collapse, other darknet marketplaces received $820 million in crypto.  Since Hydra’s collapse its competitors have been fighting for dominance, which sometimes took extravagant forms: Vice reported that one drug marketplace, Kraken (not to be confused with the crypto exchange), parked a bus painted with its logo in the center of Moscow. It also put an advertisement on a building in Moscow; OMG!OMG! did the same.  In May, immediately after Hydra’s closure, OMG!OMG! grabbed over 50% of total market share although it later suffered a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack and lost its dominant position to Mega Darknet Market and Blacksprut, Chainalysis says. Blacksprut was also attacked at one time. There are known cases of darknet platforms attacking each other with the help of hired hackers, such as the KillNet group, Vice reported.  Revenues down  The downfall of Hydra led to an entire market revenue decline, Chainalysis says. In 2021, total revenue of darknet shops (mostly drug dealing websites) was $2.6 billion; in 2022, it fell to $1.3 billion. Average daily market revenue fell from $4.2 million before Hydra’s closure to $447,000 immediately after, Chainalysis says.  Closure of another drug marketplace, Bypass Shop, which has been reportedly shut down by Russian authorities, also contributed to the overall decline. However, the drug shops' revenue has been slowly recovering since the second half of 2022, Chainlaysis wrote.  That was not the case for websites selling illicit goods other than drugs, such as stolen personal data – their fortunes continued to go down.

However, decentralized finance’s (DeFi) current functionality “barely scratches the surface,” Bank of America (BAC) said in a research report Wednesday.  The bank says platforms like Gauntlet are driving the evolution of DeFi applications, but cautions that “regulatory barriers to entry, poor user interfaces and limited functionality likely prevent mainstream adoption in the short term.”  Gauntlet is a financial risk modeling and simulation platform that acts as an adviser for application improvement. DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain.  “The inability to identify users, access credit scores and perform [know your customer/anti-money laundering] requirements creates regulatory headwinds and limits use cases to trading platforms and overcollateralized lending products, which also creates headwinds for mainstream adoption,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.  Soulbound tokens, or non-transferable identity and reputation non-fungible tokens (NFT), could be the key to expanding DeFi’s “functionality frontier,” but the majority of existing applications are under three years and old and will require time to mature, the note said.  “DeFi applications require development to produce a differentiated product and positive user experience, which drives adoption and usage,” the report said, adding that “increasing adoption and usage result in increasing revenues and native token appreciation if properly designed, both of which can be reinvested in development.”  Bank of America says the majority of DeFi applications are immature, “but we remain in the early stages of a major change in applications that may take place over the next 30 years.”  In the longer term, the bank expects the development of DeFi applications with real-world functionality to increase the efficiency of traditional financial products and services, and it anticipates that these applications will evolve by “optimizing the trade-offs between user incentives and risks.”  Read more: Bernstein Expects Crypto Revenue to Jump to Around $400B by 2033",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/09/bank-of-america-innovation-to-expand-decentralized-finance-functionality-over-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5d3dc5b221c2329d3938353db7ef71e6a54aed4-1856x1044.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

9125010,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4576533-is-bitcoin-starting-trend-higher?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1675947600,Is Bitcoin Starting To Trend Higher?,"Summary Over the last month, Bitcoin has pushed me to watch my bullish alternate count. Bitcoin’s move higher over the last month is promising, but it hasn’t been confirmed that Bitcoin’s trend has changed. While caution is still warranted for Bitcoin bulls, there will soon be a clearer indication of whether this move higher is just the beginning. Produced by Ryan Wilday with Avi Gilburt and Jason Appel In a previous article , ""Bitcoin: More Rough Waters Ahead,"" I focused on the possibility of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) sliding to $13,300, emphasizing that its November 2022 break of $16K opened the door to a longer bear market. I also offered a bullish alternative. In trading, it is always important to know where you are wrong. I gave the bullish alternative a low probability. But one should not be surprised by markets taking a low-probability path. Low does not mean zero, so trading with an alternative point of view in mind helps with risk management. In this article I will update my perspective on Bitcoin action, given its recent move higher. I will explain why I am not completely excited about this move. However, I am watching, cautiously, for more signs that the trend has changed. I will also refresh the tactical approach I gave in the above article, so you will know how I am dealing with this action with real money. The Forest Before the Trees Firstly, I want to zoom us out in order to see the lay of the land on the daily chart. Most know that Bitcoin has been in a strong downtrend since its top in 2021. But if you were to believe crypto traders on Twitter, or ‘CT’ as they have come to be called, a new bull market has started. CT is a notoriously emotional crowd that flips back and forth according to the size and color of candles. And January’s one-month candlestick on the Bitcoin chart has much in common with monthly candles in the bull markets of 2017, 2019, and 2021. Tweet expressing bullishness regarding Bitcoin (twitter.com) But a deep understanding of how markets trend is important for successful trading. Trend reversals are notoriously difficult to trade, because many fail. Reversals often stir excitement in the crowd, luring them in and then spitting them out. The faster the move, the more people come rushing in. There are many methods for determining a trend, and I have a few that I like to use. But for the sake of this article, I will stick to Elliott Wave analysis. In Elliott Wave analysis, generally, the trend is down if the price is under the 50% retrace of a progressing third wave. That is the level under which a chart can still form a reasonable fourth wave. On my chart, that level is $27,500. The price is still below that level, but it won’t take much to attack it. Sustaining that level is key to turning from the bearish trend of 2022 to a new bull market. When I use the term ‘sustaining’ with respect to resistance levels, generally I am looking for consolidation over that level and then another break higher. It appears that Bitcoin bulls will soon show what they are made of as $27,500 approaches. Daily Chart of Bitcoin (Motivewave software) Evaluating the Reversal In Elliott Wave we also look at the structure of a reversal, to assess its probability of success. A strong reversal starts with five waves. Further, the strongest confirmation you can get from a market occurs after the following steps. The market or asset forms five waves off a low, and over resistance, which is generally the 50% retrace of the third wave down. This structure we would call wave 1. The pullback that begins after those five waves should hold the .618 retrace of those five waves, or .764 in the worst case. At that point, a break out over the first five waves gives you more confirmation of a market bottom. With my subscribers, I like to call these three steps ""the mantra."" I often repeat some form of this mantra as a reversal in the crypto market forms. In fact, I repeated it many times in 2022, with each reversal. Because we never saw the completion of all three steps, it should have kept subscribers from aggressive buying. (Although each individual makes his or her own trades.) Note that confirmation should not be confused with certainty. I am not working with a crystal ball. I am analyzing the market probabilistically. As I like to say, ""Certainty in markets is at all times zero."" That means we have to take trades that are low risk and have high potential rewards, and stop out as needed. In Bitcoin’s January move, not even #1 above has been completed. So, while Bitcoin may be working on a bottom, the risk of another low is high. That said, this move higher is still developing. I want to point you to another artifact on the Bitcoin chart that is important. This is the potential of a wide, wave four flat on the chart that started in June of 2022. This is almost longer than a similar triangle pattern in Bitcoin in 2018, before it made its final crash at the end of that year. If you know Elliott Wave analysis, you may ask why I call this a wave four flat when Bitcoin made a new low in November. My concern is that the low was made in three waves, which suggests it is a B wave in this flat, not the final low. Potential wave four flat in Bitcoin (Motivewave software) Looking for a Solid Reversal With my concerns now out of the way, let’s turn to what I am looking for: for Bitcoin to give us a high-probability indication that it has bottomed. This starts with the three-point ""mantra"" above. First, we need five waves off the November low. So far, Bitcoin has given us three. However, it seems to want to hold as it consolidates in a tight range above support for the fourth at $19,900. If that level holds it should push up toward $26K, and perhaps all the way to the edge of resistance at $27,500. If that fifth wave above $26K forms, the real test for Bitcoin will be right around the corner. Naturally, it could just keep going. But generally, after a five-wave structure as clear as we would see at $27,500, a pullback begins, which I will call wave 2. If it comes down correctively and holds support, it may turn and break higher. That would give us the best confirmation we will ever get that the trend has changed. That support level will be determined after a local top is formed. I estimate it will be in the $18K region. If it pulls back to $18K, holds wave 2, and breaks out, it should work on a larger five-wave structure in the mid-$50Ks. Referencing my previous article, not sustaining a break below $16K leaves my original $125K target alive. And, the next major market top should appear near $125K. If this proves out, I'll be working from my old primary count which is now an alternate. Old primary / current alternate Bitcoin count (Motivewave software) Tactics Now let’s talk tactics. As stated in the last article, I hedged my long-term Bitcoin with a short futures position. Naturally, I stopped out of that trade. But does that mean we should go long? Over the last few weeks, I did take some long trades but they were of short duration. Now that we are moving into the fourth and fifth wave of this move, chop will increase. And it appears it already has. Bitcoin has moved in a tight range for a couple of weeks. In the fourths and fifths one should avoid aggressive trading, and size down. That said, scaling in lower in the range with quick profit-taking works well for seasoned trading. What I am really waiting for is that wave 2 pullback. If it is clearly corrective, I will look for an aggressive long position. Where I was saving cash to make more long-term buys near $13K, a corrective pullback into the $18–20K region will cause me to up the range for those purchases. And if we see a clear reversal, I will evaluate a futures trade. But it is essential to watch closely for a failure to hold the wave 2 support level, once that level is clearly determined. Failure should send Bitcoin down to an expected $13K, albeit with a very long detour. My bullish path is shown in the chart below, rendered in red. Potential bullish micro in Bitcoin (Motivewave software) Conclusion In conclusion, Bitcoin did not take my preferred path as set out in my last article, and pushed higher than expected. That move challenged the need to hedge with a short position. But Bitcoin bulls have more work to do in order to confirm that the bearish trend that started at its top in 2021 has ended. Over the next month or two I expect Bitcoin to test this recent push higher, with a move into the $18–20K region. What Bitcoin does with that region will indicate whether or not this move higher will last.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4576533-is-bitcoin-starting-trend-higher?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9125010.jpeg

Spark Protocol, which is a fork of Aave's version 3 (v3), will be a front-end app that allows users to interact with DAI in the form of borrowing, lending and staking, according to an announcement on the MakerDAO forum.  The development of a dedicated lending protocol represents a shift in focus from MakerDAO, which has aligned its revenue model with the issuance of DAI since the latter's inception in 2017. MakerDAO has formed Phoenix Labs, a research and development company that will be tasked with building the Spark Protocol.  Spark Protocol's emergence as a potential rival to Aave, which has $4.6 billion in total value locked (TVL), comes after Aave voted to introduce its own yield-generating stablecoin dubbed GHO last year.  The new protocol will be reinforced by pricing oracles, or data sources, provided by Chronicle Labs and Chainlink to enhance security in case one of the two goes down or suffers an exploit.  MakerDAO also announced the forthcoming deployment of etherDAI, a synthetic liquid staking derivative (LSD) for ether (ETH) that will be pegged at a one-to-one ratio with ETH. Liquid staking allows users to generate extra yield on top of standard rewards for staking tokens in a network.

Tether had set a goal for eliminating commercial paper – a type of short-term, unsecured debt – by the end of 2022, which it met.

Tether first published a breakdown of its reserves in May 2021, revealing that 49% of its assets were backed by commercial paper.

42412909,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6wey,1675941674,"Umami Finance CEO Dumps All Tokens After Week-Long Drama, Leaving Crypto Hopefuls Stranded","The price of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Umami Finance's native token dropped by nearly 50% over the past 24 hours amid changes to the mechanism of its native UMAMI token, prompting dismay among community members.  DeFi relies on smart contracts instead of intermediaries to provide users with financial services such as lending and borrowing.  According to messages on social forum Discord seen by CoinDesk, an Umami developer said team members had resigned from Umami Labs LLC but the move was to push Umami “back towards decentralization and a [decentralized autonomous organization] structure.”  “CEO has dumped all of his tokens via his address here, 0x21dF3E7371A58eB0e2248F1362eB5fa01fC9B34F,” the developer said. The owner of the wallet address appears to have swapped UMAMI holdings for hundreds of thousands of dollars, blockchain data on Etherscan shows.  The Abritrum-based UMAMI traded at $11 in European hours on Thursday, down from Wednesday's high of $22. It is down over 90% from its record high of $162 in December 2021.  Umami fashioned itself as an institutional DeFi player with yield products tailored to financial institutions. The products encompassed low-risk strategies that yield relatively better rewards than those offered by highly-regulated centralized finance platforms.  These yields were intended to be offered on deposits of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and USD coin (USDC).  However, Umami temporarily stopped all payouts to token holders in early February, citing regulatory considerations, messages in Umami’s Discord channel show. This caused some discourse among community members, who said the product seem to do the opposite of what it earlier told potential token investors.  Umami operated similarly to a traditional company while offering a DeFi product. Its team members were known, its operating expenses were published each month publicly and it claimed to operate in “full compliance with jurisdictional rules in all of its markets,” as per technical documents.  As such, Umami developers said the protocol's treasury assets remained safe and were in control of signatories who would obey the direction of Umami DAO and its token holders  “Team plans to move forward with a DAO structure and release vaults as planned with the Umami token having the same revenue claim as promised,” the developer wrote on Discord, stating the code required to run and operate Umami remained in control of the DAO.  “Next steps: Draft a proposal to the Umami DAO instating the Umami team (minus Ex-CEO) with the guidance of the DAO to move forward with Umami and launch vaults,” the developer added.  However, some Crypto Twitter users reported withdrawal issues as of European morning hours on Thursday.  Meanwhile, Umami Labs LLC said it was working on a detailed response to the issue in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.  ""CoinDesk's article contains numerous factual inaccuracies and omits critical information. Umami Labs is working with its legal representatives on a detailed response,"" Umami Labs LLC said.

42412902,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6wYQ,1675940362,JPMorgan Says Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade to Raise Staking Toward Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Average,"Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, scheduled for mid-March, will raise the blockchain’s staking ratio in the medium term, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday.  There is plenty of room for the 14% ratio to rise, the bank said, given that the average for other proof-of-stake (PoS) networks is about four times as high. The ratio measures the amount of staked ether versus the circulating supply.  “Assuming the staking ratio converges over time to the 60% average of other major PoS networks, the validator number could increase from 0.5 million to 2.2 million and the yield would fall from 7.4% current to around 5%,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. In a proof-of-stake system, validators attest that a block is accurate and can be added to the blockchain.  A large portion of the future increase in staking will likely move to liquid staking protocols such as Lido, the bank said. These protocols “enable liquidity for staked assets, which would otherwise be locked in the staking contracts, by providing an equal amount of derivative token in exchange for staked ether which can be traded.”  JPMorgan notes that liquid staking protocol derivative tokens have normally traded at prices below their underlying asset, but as the Shanghai upgrade nears they are converging to parity with ether (ETH).  It could be argued that the utility of these liquid staking protocols would be reduced as the upgrade date approaches, the note said. The counterargument is that the utility of these protocols is not limited to only providing liquidity, but also acting as an intermediary for retail investors who would otherwise face a barrier of 32 ETH ($52,000) for staking, the note said.  As a result, liquid staking protocols have become major decentralized finance (DeFi) players, prompting concerns about network centralization, the note added.

This uptick in activity stems from the popularity of the Ordinals protocol, which allows for non-fungible tokens (NFT) to be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. NFT activity on Bitcoin has risen exponentially, according to research from BitMEX, with over 13,000 Ordinals minted since December.  Read More: Bitcoin NFTs Explode in Popularity as BitMEX Research Shows 13,000 Ordinals  According to CryptoQuant’s data, the seven-day moving average of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain hit 345,000, a figure not seen since the second quarter of 2021, when miners had to pack up and leave China.  Ordinals store the NFTs directly on-chain, unlike NFTs on Ethereum, which use services such as IPFS or Filecoin to store them. This has resulted in some of the largest block sizes in the history of Bitcoin, with many blocks hitting the 4 megabyte (MB) block size limit.  It has also led to an increase in transaction fees, but they are still below levels seen last year.  Within the Bitcoin community, the popularity of Ordinals has triggered a significant debate on whether this is the “right” use for the Bitcoin blockchain. Pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, in posts from the forum Bitcoin Talk, was strongly against non-financial uses of Bitcoin.  While some of those against Ordinals cite the possibility of a rise of transaction fees as a reason to oppose them, CryptoQuant notes that an uptick in demand for block space, coupled with a rise in fees generated by miners, is positive for long-term network security for Bitcoin.

While the company on Jan. 25 outlined plans to transform into a publicly traded ""recovery corporation,"" it needs to hurry up to avoid mounting lawyers’ fees from draining the estate dry, the filings said.  “These cases must proceed towards a resolution,” a filing on behalf of Celsius’ unsecured creditors said, adding that in the eight months since the company halted withdrawals “many account holders’ lives and finances have been upended because of the past conduct of the Debtors and certain of their former directors and officers.”  U.S. bankruptcy law grants a defunct company the exclusive right to offer up a reorganization plan for a limited period of normally four months, after which other stakeholders, including the companies’ creditors, can put forward their own ideas.  “There remains substantial ‘work to do’ to finalize” a proposal which could see most creditors offered liquid crypto, the creditors’ filing said, adding that there’s still no binding deal or decision as to whether to include Celsius' mining assets.  In a Jan. 25 motion, the company asked to extend its exclusive deadline for filing a plan by six weeks until the end of March, and to be able to solicit votes on it until the end of June. If the deal doesn’t come through, the reorganization could be replaced by a full liquidation of assets, the company said.  But according to U.S. Trustee William Harrington – a Department of Justice official responsible for bankruptcy cases – “There is no basis given to extend this case another five months just for the filing and soliciting of a plan.”  With the rate at which lawyers are ""consuming"" what's left of the company's assets, another extension through June ""is inappropriate,"" Harrington said in a Wednesday filing.  A hearing on the issue is scheduled for Feb. 15 before Martin Glenn, a bankruptcy court judge in the Southern District of New York.

AI tokens are up an average of over 60% in the past week alone, CryptoSlate data shows. Among the biggest gainers have been tokens for platforms such as Alethea's artificial liquid intelligence (ALI), Fetch.ai's (FET) and SingularityNET's AGIX, which have more than tripled.  Some market watchers remain cautious about the AI token hype, however.  “There is a risk that this whole new trend is going to end up in an empty hype, as there are many speculators that would seek to make use of short-term price pumps,” financial market consultant Valentina Drofa told CoinDesk earlier this week.

42412907,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6wd6,1675932872,Cardano Upgrade Aims to Improve Cross-Chain Features as On-Chain DeFi Crosses $100M TVL,"An upcoming upgrade on Cardano will make enhancements to cross-chain functionality for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications building on the network, developers tweeted Thursday.  The proposal was submitted on Wednesday and will take effect on Feb.11 at 00:00 UTC, as per tweets from Cardano code maintainer IOG. The upgrade will initially be tested in a virtual testing environment that mimics real-world performance before it is eventually released on mainnet.  The upgrade is said to bring enhanced cryptographic features to Cardano while improving cross-chain decentralized application (dapp) development on Plutus – the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain.  Cross-chain bridges are software applications that enable transactions to occur between various blockchains. Such a feature on Cardano would allow developers to build applications that connect Cardano with other blockchains, which would in-turn give access to users other blockchains to interact easily with financial services offered by Cardano dapps.  Dapps rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen to offer financial services, such as lending and borrowing, to users, who often use that dapp’s token or are rewarded in those tokens.  The upgrade comes as Cardano-based DeFi applications crossed $100 million in total locked value (TVL) last week, an eight-month high. DeFi exchanges Minswap and Wingriders account for over 50% of this TVL, DeFiLlama data shows.  Interest in Cardano DeFi has heightened since the launch of the overcollateralized djed stablecoin earlier this month. As CoinDesk previously reported, djed is backed by other tokens and requires between 400% and 800% in collateral value to be posted before it is issued to a user.  This overcollateralized mechanism would allow djed's value to be stable during market stress and prevent a repeat of terraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin linked to the Terra system's luna token, which fell in value by over 99% in May.  Shen, the reserve token meant to support djed's stability, receive additional rewards when holders of Cardano's ADA cryptocurrency stake their coins to mint djed stablecoins, which fuels liquidity for the upstart ecosystem.  This has the potential to increase user demand for shen, which may prompt a surge in price over the coming weeks as djed is integrated with more Cardano-based applications that add to its utility.  Such enhancements could ultimately benefit ADA, Cardano's native token, as well as the tokens of projects building on Cardano. As of Thursday, ADA trades at 38 cents and has a market capitalization of $13 billion.  IOG or the Cardano Foundation did not immediately return requests for comments at press time.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/09/cardano-upgrade-aims-to-improve-cross-chain-features-as-on-chain-defi-crosses-100m-tvl,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/949b8df1f238d540472861ab5cb73bf60b80bd6d-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Yield farming backed by U.S. government debt.  Following the recent launch of Ondo Finance’s U.S. Treasury-backed Government Bond Fund (OUSG), Flux Finance has launched a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to deposit USDC or DAI into Flux’s protocol, which is backed by OUSG, and, in turn, receive fUSDC or fDAI, two derivative tokens representing the USDC and DAI on Flux.  Flux is a fork of the popular lending and borrowing protocol Compound, which holds billions of dollars in locked tokens as of Thursday.  DeFi protocols like Flux rely on smart contracts instead of intermediaries to provide financial services – such as lending and borrowing – to users. On the other hand, yield farming refers to users getting rewarded with a project’s tokens for providing liquidity to that project.  Read More: DeFi Protocol Ondo Finance Sets Up Tokenized Corporate Bonds With Over 8% Yield on Stablecoins  The fUSDC and fDAI tokens can then be used as collateral at lending and derivatives protocols. All this is similar to how liquid staking protocols like Lido issue tokens such as stETH, which represent ether staked on their platforms at a 1:1 ratio, and can be used for yield farming.  The interest in yield from tokenized U.S. Treasurys comes as lending rates for major DeFi platforms struggle after 2022’s chaotic crypto market, and the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, making conventional assets potentially more alluring than DeFi.  According to DeFi Prime, the average rate for USDC lending is 1.68%. But conventional savings accounts at traditional finance (TradFi) entities are paying more, up to 4%, in this rising rate environment. For instance, CapitalOne offers 3.4% and Discover pays 3.3%.

42412899,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6wVc,1675907274,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Hovers Near $23K; Why AI Tokens Are on a Months-Long Tear,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin spent another day near its most recent $23K support. LDO spikes.  Insights: AI-related tokens have been surging for months amid rising institutional investment, writes CoinDesk editor Shaurya Malwa in an excerpt from a Feb. 8 news analysis. But some observers of the space are skeptical that their current ride higher can continue.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,086 −12.6 ▼ 1.1% Bitcoin (BTC) $22,970 −363.2 ▼ 1.6% Ethereum (ETH) $1,655 −31.7 ▼ 1.9% S&P 500  4,117.86 −46.1 ▼ 1.1% Gold  $1,886 +8.3 ▲ 0.4% Nikkei 225  27,606.46 −79.0 ▼ 0.3% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin Holds Firm Near $23K; LDO Jumps on Armstrong Tweet  What did U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell mean in remarks Tuesday at the Economic Club of Washington D.C.?  Crypto investors and otherwise spent much of Wednesday weighing a repeat of Powell's utterances from a week ago that the ""deflationary process"" had started but that the Federal Reserve would remain vigilant about stamping out high inflation; and somewhat more hawkish remarks from three Federal Reserve governors, including John Williams, who suggested central bankers would consider more aggressive rate hikes if the inflation climate worsened.  Bitcoin digested the latest developments and held steady throughout the day around its current support just below $23,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $22,970, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours. BTC's recent lull follows a January surge to remember.  ""Bitcoin’s strong start to the year appears to be over for now,"" Edward Moya, chief market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email. ""After hitting some key technical resistance just above the $24,000 level, bitcoin is entering consolidation modes.""  Moya added that bitcoin could lose its current perch with ""the next big move in bond yields.""  ""Bond market volatility will be insane after the Valentine’s day inflation report, which might mean bitcoin could drift towards the $20,000 level if stocks get hammered over the next few sessions,"" he wrote.  Yields on two- and 10-year U.S. Treasurys both dropped slightly on Wednesday.  Meanwhile, ether followed bitcoin's lead, holding its most recent support comfortably above $1,600, although it was recently down over 2% from Tuesday, same time. But as CoinDesk markets analyst Glenn Williams noted Wednesday in a column column, the second-largest crypto in market value had regained its correlation to BTC after lagging so far this year. Both cryptos are up about 38% since Jan. 1.  Other major cryptos in market value were recently in the red, although Lido DAO's LDO token jumped 8% at one point, much of its gain coming late Wednesday (ET) after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that he'd heard rumors the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would like to ban retail investors from engaging in cryptocurrency staking, the income-generating technique at the core of running blockchains including Ethereum.  ""I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen,"" Armstrong wrote.  Equity markets closed down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component dropping 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively, as markets also continued to mull over mixed, fourth-quarter earnings and jobs data recent that has been defiantly strong, suggesting Fed monetary policy hasn't been fully successful.  ""If the Valentine’s Day [Feb. 14] inflation report ends up being a hot one, traders might start believing the Fed’s hawkish pushback,"" Oanda's Moya wrote.

In a Feb. 8 analysis, CoinDesk editor Shaurya Malwa highlighted the huge gains of AI-related tokens, including the platforms of Alethea's artificial liquid intelligence (ALI), Fetch.ai's (FET) and SingularityNET (AGIX), which have surged as much as 220%. Malwa wrote that institutional interest has helped create a compelling argument for crypto traders to bet on AI-focused tokens as the next growth sector. But will the momentum last? Opinions vary as Malwa notes in an excerpt from his story.  AI broadly refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and act like humans. Popular applications for this technology have so far been limited to chatbots, self-driving cars, optimizing search in online marketplaces and image-generation software – but futuristic use cases envision wholly autonomous cities, cyborg humankind and interstellar travel.  Much of the recent surge in AI tokens emerged after the public launch of chatbot ChatGPT and image generation software DALL-E in mid-2022. Both are traditional software that do not use cryptocurrencies or blockchain and were launched by OpenAI, which recently raised $10 billion from Microsoft at a $29 billion valuation.  Such institutional interest has helped create a compelling argument for crypto traders to bet on AI-focused tokens as the next growth sector.  ""The growth opportunity around the AI and Web3 space combines early interest, potential and hype,” states Ravindra Kumar, founder of crypto wallet Frontier. “While it's true that there may be some hype surrounding AI intervention in the crypto space, we are seeing the emergence of innovative and compelling use cases.’  Aditya Khanduri, head of marketing at Biconomy, takes a milder approach: “I believe that the current AI trend is still pretty speculative, leading to a jump for tokens like OCEAN, ALI, AGIX. Some of the tokens with more buzz and followings have pumped and it's less about the actual tech behind it.”  “This is because the current AI tokens and Web3 projects may not yet know what these decentralized AI tools look like. There's a lot of unanswered challenges and lots to be figured out,” Khanduri told CoinDesk in a recent chat.  The likes of Khanduri say token-based usage while scaling AI software is a hard problem to solve.  “Say an AI tool gets to 250 million users. Then what will its infra look like? How will people use it? How will the data be trained? Where does the token fit in? Can you even have a way to reward people for their data if you used it to train your models?” he said.  Meanwhile, some market watchers remain cautious about the AI token hype.  “Once the market starts livening up a bit, all sorts of new trends come out of the woodwork. And they are not all as solid as they might look,” financial market consultant Valentina Drofa told CoinDesk.  “There is a risk that this whole ‘new trend’ is going to end up in an empty hype, as there are many speculators that would seek to make use of short-term price pumps,” Drofa added, referring to the recent multifold gains put up by some tokens.  “The industry at large will end up dealing with the long-term fallout and another hit to its image. Such cycles are becoming rather tiresome and sad to observe again and again,” she stated.
