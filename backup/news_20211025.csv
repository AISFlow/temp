Ant Group reiterated it is against the digital collectibles hype and market speculation and added that the term “digital collectibles” will be “better understood by the public.”  Ant Group runs a marketplace focused on celebrity NFTs on its Alipay platform, and has issued NFT collections of historical artifacts as recently as Friday, as well as one for the 2022 Asia Games.

42421990,injgCs3EK97aPbtENAZ6G8,1635193658,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rises Again as Altcoins Outperform,"Bitcoin is recovering from a weekend dip as traders anticipate the third U.S. futures-focused bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing. The VanEck Bitcoin Futures ETF is expected to launch on Tuesday and will trade under the ticker symbol XBTF. Analysts continue to expect further upside in bitcoin’s price given strong investor sentiment on ETF approvals.  Last week, crypto investment funds saw a record $1.47 billion in inflows as investors positioned themselves ahead of the first U.S. bitcoin-linked ETF launch, by ProShares. Alternative cryptocurrency-focused funds also saw inflows, which coincided with a near 30% rise in Solana’s SOL token over the past week.  Analysts are also monitoring the recent rotation to alternative coins (altcoins), which are starting to outperform bitcoin. “The crypto market is turning from being dominated by short-term traders who want to ride the speculative trends to longer-term investors who value the technical capabilities of the different blockchains, challenging bitcoin’s market dominance,” Anders Nysteen, quantitative analyst at Saxo Bank, wrote in a research report.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $62,813.67, +3.3%  Ether (ETH): $4,191.45, +3.53%  S&P 500: $4,566.48, +0.47%  Gold: $1,806.85, +0.69%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.64%  Record $1.5 billion crypto fund inflows  Investors pumped a record $1.47 billion in new money into digital asset investment products last week, fueled by a rally in cryptocurrencies and the launch of the ProShares bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund, according to a CoinShares report Monday.  Bitcoin-focused funds dominated last week’s inflows, at 99%. During the prior week, inflows into bitcoin-focused funds were at $70 million, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported.  Bitcoin dominance declines  The bitcoin dominance ratio, or the measure of bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market, declined last week to 45%. The decline in the dominance ratio was due to the recent outperformance of several altcoins such as ETH and SOL.  Some traders are starting to rotate into altcoins, which suggests a greater appetite for risk. “Overall, we are structurally long BTC, ETH and most layer 1s such as ALGO and SOL,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat.  But is the rotation to altcoins sustainable?  The chart below shows the bitcoin dominance ratio, which increased from a recent low of 40% in mid-September. A similar situation occurred in 2018 before the start of a crypto bear market. At that time, the bitcoin dominance ratio rose as investors reduced their exposure to altcoins and sought relative safety in bitcoin.  Currently, the bitcoin dominance ratio is declining from a high of 48% in July, which was when crypto prices stabilized from a correction earlier this year. Similar to February-March 2018, traders are returning to buy the dip in altcoins that have lagged behind a sharp recovery in bitcoin over the past month. For now, some analysts expect altcoins to take the lead, because cryptocurrencies typically produce positive returns during the fourth quarter.  Altcoin roundup  Shiba Inu hits record high: Shiba Inu (SHIB) tapped lifetime highs on Sunday, trading at $0.0000455 at 11:20 UTC, topping the previous record reached on May 10, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported. Prices for the meme token have risen by nearly 50% in the past 24 hours, with a month-to-date gain of almost 500%. SHIB’s latest rise comes amid rumors that Robinhood may soon list the cryptocurrency on its platform.  Solana also hit a new record high: Prices for Solana’s SOL tokens hit a record high on early Monday as a majority of tokens representing layer 1 blockchains followed bitcoin, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported. The token, which is backed by FTX crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried, traded at $218.9 on Monday. According to decentralized finance data provider Defi Llama, the total value locked in Solana reached an all-time high of approximately $13.91 billion.  Ether hit all-time high last week while seeing continued outflows: Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, hit a record high on Oct. 21 at $4,361, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported. However, despite the price increase, funds focused on the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization saw outflows for a third consecutive week, totaling $1.4 million last week. Other altcoins, including SOL, Cardano’s ADA currency and Binance coin (BNB), all saw inflows.

42421979,injgCs3EK97aPbtENAZ5k2,1635193351,DeFi on the Ballot: Yearn Developer Matt West Is Running for Congress,"First a MakerDAO lobbyist, now a Yearn candidate.  As regulatory stormclouds gather over Washington and crypto advocates seek to obtain a louder voice in U.S. politics, one Yearn.Finance developer is running for Congress on a pro-crypto platform.  That said, he may need the decentralized finance (DeFi) community’s help if he hopes to win.  On Oct. 12, Matt West declared his candidacy for Oregon’s newly formed 6th U.S. House district. West holds a Ph.D. from the University of Texas in chemical engineering with a focus on renewable energy, and works at tech giant Intel on manufacturing.  In an interview with CoinDesk last month, West said he got involved with Yearn last year as a side gig.  “I got extremely bored with every day being the same, so I started stretching my brain a little bit, started teaching myself Solidity, started working with Yearn, worked with a partner and won their hackathon last year – we integrated Hegic to create that now-defunct vault,” he said.  Until recently he’s been working with the team from no-loss lottery protocol PoolTogether on Yearn’s stablecoin yield farming strategies.  PoolTogether founder Leighton Cusack recently took to Twitter to express support for West’s candidacy:  West is notable for being perhaps the first DeFi-literate candidate to run for office, and is certainly the first DeFi developer to launch a campaign.  It’s a welcome development for advocates who believe recent actions from legislators – such as an amendment to an infrastructure bill that nearly rendered running an Ethereum node legally impossible – are out of touch and destructive.  Indeed, over the summer Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) decried crypto’s “shadowy super-coders” – a label that West wears proudly.  “You know, when Warren said that, I said, ‘She’s not wrong,’” he joked.  But while many would-be crypto candidates are generally focused on one issue, West says the seed for his run was planted years ago, and his platform reflects that.  “My state’s constantly on fire, there’s federal overreach, there’s outside protestors like the Proud Boys coming in to start riots – it came to a breaking point,” he told CoinDesk of his decision to run.  Making a difference  A growing number of crypto advocates have toyed with runs in the wake of recent regulatory scrutiny.  Messari founder Ryan Selkis is currently threatening a 2024 run for Senate.  Popular crypto talk show host and proud Alabaman Brian Krogsgard, better known as Ledger, has also publicly mused on a run for Senate.  Read more: Compromise Provision Tanked by Near-Retiree, but Crypto Shows DC It’s Here to Stay  While both Selkis and Krogsgard were spurred to action by events in the crypto-sphere, West says his decision to run came after he saw the crackdown on the Black Lives Matter protests.  “I live in the suburbs of Portland, and my city’s been through hell and back in the last few years. Watching the federal government coming in and kidnapping our civilians off the streets in unmarked vans and taking them to undisclosed locations – that was incredibly terrifying,” he said.  These views might seem at odds with crypto-bro culture at first blush, but West argues that individuals contributing to the technology sport a variety of ideological stripes.  “Crypto is an interesting space. You have die-hard libertarians and people trying to do universal basic income in the same field,” he said. “To crib from the Republicans, it’s a big tent.”  Unlike Krogsgard and Selkis, West is doing more than just talking about a run: He has filed with the relevant authorities, hired a dedicated campaign manager and has been paying out of pocket for legal consultations related to accepting crypto donations.  “This isn’t a vanity project for me. I want to make a difference, and if I can’t do it like this I’ll find another way,” he said.  Know thy neighbor  It remains somewhat up in the air who West’s competition will be since the borders of Oregon’s 6th district were only finalized on Sept. 27.  “It’s a brand-new district, so we don’t really know who’s running yet. We’re going to wait and see – it’ll be an open seat, so it’ll be more of a competitive primary than a competitive general, would be my guess,” West said.  He does believe, however, his positions will end up being well aligned with a strongly Democratic district.  “My actual politics are pretty leftist,” he said, noting that he holds “pro unionization, pro living wage” views and that he is vocal about the importance of addressing global climate change – a noted bugaboo for environmentalists that often view crypto with suspicion, if not outright hostility.  Read more: How DeFi Can Help Make Climate Change an Investable Asset  He doesn’t think climate activists will hold his crypto credentials against him, however.  “I think my chances become fairly good when you add in that I’ve been in Oregon for some time, I did research on global warming in grad school, for my job I’ve been in the research and development facility at Intel helping design future manufacturing processes – I’ve got academia, global warming and industry experience.”  Money matters  West is quick to admit that, as a relative outsider, his odds hinge primarily on what he can raise.  “It’s really a matter of riding momentum – it’s a sad fact of politics that early money might determine the issue,” he said.  He started his campaign by “putting in a little bit to get started and to self-fund the wheels,” including hiring staff and conducting preliminary research.  Now that he’s declared, however, he says he needs the community’s support – he even held off on announcing his run on Twitter until his campaign and BitPay managed to navigate the legal hurdles presented by crypto donations.  “It was a big deal for me to accept crypto donations from the start of the campaign. There are a few folks who run as crypto-friendly and take donations, but as someone who is coming directly from the crypto community as a developer and contributor it wasn’t just a marketing gimmick,” he said. “I wanted to show to the crypto community that they matter to me.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MKR | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/18/defi-on-the-ballot-yearn-developer-matt-west-is-running-for-congress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a371f613349055b61c5befdbe768310a8430f08-1321x1057.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421715,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDPZ,1635189956,NFTs and the Patronage Model,"Last week, a crypto investment collective called PleasrDAO paid $4 million for a copy of the Wu-Tang Clan’s seventh album, “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.”  If that sounds insane to you, consider the circumstances, which are also insane. The record was conceived as a one-of-one physical edition – just one CD would ever be made, and whoever bought that one copy would be contractually forbidden from distributing it for sale. Martin Shkreli, the notorious pharmaceutical executive and fraudster, bought the album back in 2015. He held onto it until 2018, when the federal government confiscated it in the wake of his fraud conviction.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Announcing their purchase of the record last week, members of PleasrDAO said they saw the concept as being in line with the values behind non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the blockchain-based collectibles that have become PleasrDAO’s bread and butter over the past year. NFTs are a form of cryptocurrency attached to media files – JPEG files are endlessly reproducible, thanks to the copy-paste function, but the crypto component can give them an element of scarcity. There’s only one of each token, and because transaction records are available publicly on the blockchain, imposter NFTs are easy to identify.  “The album itself is kind of the O.G. NFT,” one PleasrDAO member told The New York Times, making that connection explicit.  Read more: Martin Shkreli’s Wu-Tang Clan Album Now Belongs to a DAO  Predictably, the group has also turned “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin” into an actual NFT. Per the Times article, “The 74 members of PleasrDAO… share collective ownership of the NFT deed, and thus own the album.” PleasrDAO is also saying it wants to find a way to skirt that baked-in contractual obligation and share the music with a wider audience (potentially through fractionalization).  It’s both an act of crypto evangelism (an ad, basically, for the organization) and an interesting argument for a new economic model centered around patronage. Streaming is unsustainable for most musicians because revenues tend to be divvied up pro rata. According to Rolling Stone, 90% of streams are going to the top 1% of artists on platforms like Spotify. In a pro rata model, that 1% ends up with 90% of the money these platforms have decided to set aside for artists.  In the NFT patronage model, a media file is treated as a public good. All you need is one person who’s willing to pay for the token; once it’s purchased, the work exists online for free. Anyone with an internet connection can enjoy the work, while the wealthy speculators do their thing amongst themselves, selling and reselling the token as value fluctuates over time. You can see this in practice on Catalog, a platform for music NFTs, where token-backed albums are selling for tens of thousands of dollars.  It’s happening with one-of-one NFTs, but it’s also happening with limited sets, as a kind of experimental alternative to Patreon or Kickstarter. The writers Kyle Chayka and Daisy Alioto funded their newsletter, Dirt, by selling NFTs of original artworks. Crucially, the NFTs don’t work as access passes – the posts are available for anyone to read – but the writers and editors get paid.  But just as the Wu-Tang album is a unique case (an album-as-gimmick, from one of the most famous hip-hop acts on the planet) it’s hard to imagine that every small artist or writer could make money this way. PleasrDAO bought “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin” to make a point about the long-term value of crypto. And the people who bought into the Dirt crowdfund were by and large technologists and investors, many of whom have a stake in proving these models are viable.  NFT ownership isn’t intuitive. What do you own, really, when you buy the token for an album or a piece of writing?

42421980,injgCs3EK97aPbtENAZ5nF,1635189331,DCG’s $1B Pledge and an SEC Filing Kindle Fresh Speculation on ‘Grayscale Discount’,"Last week Digital Currency Group, a crypto-industry holding company, opened its wallet to defend its Grayscale subsidiary’s Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), when the fund’s shares traded at a 20.53% discount to its underlying bitcoin holdings – the steepest in five months.  Digital Currency Group’s pledge to buy as much as $1 billion worth of GBTC shares might have represented savvy, opportunistic timing. Or it might have been a demonstration of support for the $39.45 billion GBTC, the world’s largest bitcoin fund, in the face of increasing competition.  Then, a day later, Grayscale officially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to convert the trust into a spot-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), even though SEC Chair Gary Gensler has signaled his preference for an ETF investing in bitcoin futures. (In recent days several futures ETFs have been approved in the U.S.)  Thanks to these developments, the GBTC discount between the price of the underlying bitcoin asset and the price of the trust’s shares has since narrowed to about 16%, based on data from the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.  But will it decrease further?  Perhaps, if the futures ETFs already approved by the SEC lead to approval of funds that hold actual bitcoin, Bloomberg commodities analyst Mike McGlone wrote last week. He added that perhaps the GBTC discount would evaporate if the trust was allowed to convert to an ETF.  “We see increasing pressure for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve the GBTC ETF,” McGlone said in the market update shared with CoinDesk on Oct. 20. “Grayscale has said it’s committed to converting GBTC to an ETF. We see that as a matter of time, notably with a new digital divide opening [against] China, which may make bitcoin and crypto success a vested interest of the U.S.”  However, other analysts talking to CoinDesk last week disagree, saying the price discrepancy will likely persist for the foreseeable future.  “Any announcements about purchasing GBTC on the open market, or signaling towards an ETF conversion, are just empty promises in an attempt to bring in arbitrageurs and likely will not have much impact,” Jeff Dorman, CIO at Arca Funds, told CoinDesk in an email. “I don’t think the discount will close any time soon and probably should widen.”  DCG, which also owns CoinDesk as an independent subsidiary, said it would buy much as $1 billion worth of GBTC, up from a prior authorization of $750 million. As of Oct. 19, DCG had already purchased $388 million worth of shares, according to the press release dated Oct. 20. DCG declined to comment on the issue.  Grayscale allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin through shares in the trust, which currently holds 647,540 BTC, according to bybt.com. That amounts to around 3% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply.  GBTC shares are derivatives of bitcoin and, in theory, should closely track the cryptocurrency’s price. So a substantial discount or premium is an opportunity for arbitrageurs – traders exploiting price discrepancies – to make money.  For example, with shares currently trading at a discount of 16% at press time, an arbitrageur expecting the price discrepancy to narrow would buy GBTC shares in the secondary market and simultaneously sell bitcoin in the spot market. The market-neutral position would yield 16% returns if shares in GBTC converge with the spot price. An arbitrageur can also hedge the long GBTC trade with a short position in the futures market, in which case, the return would be higher as futures usually trade at a premium to the spot price and converge with the spot price on expiry.  “The ability to buy GBTC and short futures and get exposure to bitcoin with about a 25% price advantage should continue to attract arbitrage, reduce volatility and narrow spreads,” Bloomberg’s McGlone said on Oct. 20, when the discount was over 20% and the six-month futures contract was drawing a premium of 4%.  Grayscale Investments LLC recently filed the regulatory documents to convert the bitcoin trust into a spot-based ETF. A spot-based ETF would allow for more continual creation and redemption of new shares by market makers, so ostensibly it would track bitcoin’s price more closely than the current trust structure. Thus, it could be a big hit on Wall Street.  “The trust is desperate to return to par value, and I think they will need to in some manner,” Ben Lilly, a crypto economist at Jarvis Labs, said. “At a 17% discount, I find it attractive.”  ‘Arb away’  According to Arca’s Dorman, traders may be less inclined to “arb away” the discount solely on the assumption that Grayscale’s plan to convert the trust into an ETF would win approval; that currently appears to be a low-probability event, in his view. Besides, traders can nearly earn double-digit returns via other strategies that appear relatively less risky.  Said Dorman: “Buying GBTC for that 17% discount is the equivalent of buying a 0% coupon, two-year bond at 83 cents on the dollar (not including Grayscale’s 2% management fee, which makes it even less attractive to own). That is a 9.5% annual yield, roughly equivalent to what you can earn lending a stablecoin right now – the ‘risk-free rate’ in digital assets. As such, GBTC is not a very attractive instrument to own.”  The prospect of the SEC reversing its stance and approving Grayscale’s plan to convert into a spot-based ETF strikes some observers as unlikely in the near future.  “The idea of turning the trust into an ETF was to close the discount in the open market,” said Kevin Kang, founding principal of BKCoin Capital. “However, with the SEC chair only mentioning that he was comfortable with the futures-based ETFs, I am not sure when that will happen.”  Says Laurent Kssis, director of CEC Capital and former managing director of exchange-traded products (ETP) at 21Shares: “You just don’t shift a closed-end fund into an open-ended structure overnight in the U.S.”  “Just like with European crypto issuers, I see a new ETF program being filed (previously closed-end structure) and introduced, marking a new era for Grayscale,” Ksiss told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Dorman said he was skeptical that Grayscale would willingly forgo its management fees from the Grayscale trust, estimated at $800 million a year.  “If they convert to an ETF, that guaranteed revenue goes away, and they immediately enter an oversaturated race where fees will trend towards 0%, and they will be competing against companies with bigger, better brands than themselves. That’s a formula for failure,” Dorman said. “They are better off being hated by their investors but generating perpetual fees. Why voluntarily destroy the greatest business model in history?”  A ‘PR stunt?’  According to an Oct. 20 Twitter thread by Messari’s Ryan Selkis, DCG’s plans to expand purchases is a “PR stunt to make unwitting investors think DCG can close” the GBTC discount, which is “impossible given the size of the trust.”  But he says it may be hard for Gensler, the SEC chair, to argue that preventing GBTC from converting to a spot ETF would fall under the rubric of “investor protection” because it comes at “the expense of of shareholders,” Selkis wrote. If the trust were allowed to convert to an ETF, the fund’s shares would probably trade back close to the value of the underlying bitcoin. In other words, the Grayscale discount would go away.  While in ETFs, specialized traders known as authorized participants create and redeem shares to keep their price in line with the net asset value; that process is not available with Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust.  The vehicle can only create a basket of shares, offer liquidity under Rule 144 resales, and cannot provide a redemption program – meaning shares can only be created and not destroyed. (In 2016, the SEC slapped Grayscale for offering redemptions.)  For several years, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust was the only credible option for institutions to get exposure to bitcoin without buying the digital asset directly. That led to a steep premium on its shares in the secondary market. The persistent premium provided a strong incentive for accredited investors to buy GBTC at its net asset value by depositing bitcoin to capture the spread six months later. The premium reached as high as 40% in December last year.  According to the crypto derivatives research firm Skew, the premium was the function of “exposure to bitcoin in a regulated vehicle without having to deal with the challenges of custody, eligibility to some tax-efficient schemes, strong distribution through regular brokerage accounts, lack of alternatives such as an ETF.”  However, with the advent of the spot-based ETFs in Europe and Canada early this year, the demand for GBTC weakened, and the premium flipped to discount in the first quarter, killing the so-called Grayscale carry trade.  The number of options available to gain exposure to bitcoin has only increased with the launch of ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and Valkyrie’s ETF last week. Both products invest in the CME-based bitcoin futures contracts in a bid to replicate the cryptocurrency’s performance.  “I don’t foresee any improvement in the performance levels of GBTC to its discounted rate as anticipated institutional-grade crypto products are coming to the market,” CEC Capital’s Kssis said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/25/dcgs-1b-pledge-and-an-sec-filing-kindle-fresh-speculation-on-grayscale-discount,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5028397f20895b0e4202e2498781051ada1440d1-1200x670.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421709,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDLR,1635187389,The Coming Convergence of NFTs and Artificial Intelligence,"Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are becoming one of the most important trends in the crypto ecosystem. The first generation of NFTs has focused on key properties such as ownership representation, transfer, automation as well as building the core building blocks of the NFT market infrastructure.  The hype in the NFT market makes it relatively hard to distinguish signal versus noise when even the most simplistic form of NFTs are able to capture incredible value. But, as the space evolves, the value proposition of NFTs should go from static images or text to more dynamic and intelligent collectibles. Artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to have an impact in the next wave of NFTs.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence platform for crypto assets. He has held leadership roles at major technology companies and hedge funds. He is an active investor, speaker, author and guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York.  We are already seeing manifestations of NFT-AI convergence in the form of generative art. However, the potential is much bigger. Injecting AI capabilities into the lifecycle of NFTs opens the door to forms of intelligent ownership that we haven’t seen before.  Intelligent ownership  Today, NFTs remain mostly digital manifestations of the offline word in areas such as art or collectibles. While compelling, that vision is quite limited. A more intriguing way to think about NFTs is as digital ownership primitives. Ownership representations have much wider applications than collectibles. While in the physical world ownership is mostly represented as static records, in the digital on-chain world ownership can be programmable, composable and, of course, intelligent.  With intelligent digital ownership the possibilities are endless. Let’s illustrate this in the context of collectibles that remain one the best-known applications of NFTs.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez - When DeFi Becomes Intelligent  Imagine digital-art NFTs that could converse in natural language answering questions to explain the inspiration behind their creation and adapt those answers to a specific conversation context. We could also envision NFTs that could adapt to your feelings, mood and provide an experience that is constantly fulfilling. What about intelligent NFT wallets that, as they interact with a website, could decide which ownership rights to present in order to improve the experience for a given user?  Echoing William Gibson’s famous quote, “The future is already here, it’s just not very evenly distributed,” we should think about the intersection of intelligent digital ownership as something that is possible with today’s AI and NFT technologies. NFTs are likely to evolve as a digital ownership primitive and intelligence should definitely be part of it.  AI and NFTs  To understand how intelligent NFTs can be enabled with today’s technologies, we should understand what AI disciplines have intersection points with the current generation of NFTs. The digital representation of NFTs relies on digital formats such as images, video, text or audio. These representations map brilliantly to different AI sub-disciplines.  Podcast: How Erick Calderon Turned NFT Squiggles Into a $6M Funding Round  Deep learning is the area of AI that relies on deep neural networks as a way to generalize knowledge from datasets. Although the ideas behind deep learning have been around since the 1970s, they have seen an explosion in the last decade with a number of frameworks and platforms that have catalyzed its mainstream adoption. There are some key areas of deep learning that can be incredibly influential to enable intelligence capabilities in NFTs:  Computer vision: NFTs today are mostly about images and videos and, therefore, a perfect fit to leverage the advancements in computer vision. In recent years, techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), generative adversarial neural networks (GAN) and, more recently, transformers have pushed the boundaries of computer vision. Image generation, object recognition, scene understanding are some of the computer vision techniques that can be applied in the next wave of NFT technologies. Generative art seems like a clear domain to combine computer vision and NFTs.  Natural language understanding: Language is a fundamental form to express cognition, and that includes forms of ownership. Natural language understanding (NLU) has been at the center of some of the most important breakthroughs in deep learning in the last decade. Techniques such as transformers powering models such as GPT-3 have reached new milestones in NLU. Areas such as question answering, summarization and sentiment analysis could be relevant to new forms of NFTs. The idea of superposing language understanding to existing forms of NFTs seems like a trivial mechanism to enrich the interactivity and user experience in NFTs.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez - 3 Factors That Make Quant Trading in Crypto Unique  Speech recognition: Speech intelligence can be considered the third area of deep learning that can have an immediate impact in NFTs. Techniques such as CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have advanced the speech intelligence space in the last few years. Capabilities such as speech recognition or tone analysis could power interesting forms of NFTs. Not surprisingly, audio-NFTs seem like the perfect scenario for speech intelligence methods.  Three key categories at the intersection of AI and NFTs  The advancements in language, vision and speech intelligence expand the horizon of NFTs. The value unlocked at the intersection of AI and NFTs will impact not one but many dimensions of the NFT ecosystem. In today’s NFT ecosystem, there are three fundamental categories that can be immediately reimagined by incorporating AI capabilities:  AI-generated NFTs: This seems to be the most obvious dimension of the NFT ecosystem to benefit from recent advancements in AI technologies. Leveraging deep learning methods in areas such as computer vision, language and speech can enrich the experience for NFT creators to levels we haven’t seen before. Today, we can see manifestations of this trend in areas such as generative art but they remain relatively constrained both in terms of the AI methods used as well as in the use cases they tackle.  In the near future, we should see the value of AI-generated NFTs to expand beyond generative art into more generic NFT utility categories providing a natural vehicle for leveraging the latest deep learning techniques. An example of this value proposition can be seen in digital artists like Refik Anadol who are already experimenting with cutting edge deep learning methods for the creation of NFTs. Anadol’s studio have been a pioneer in using techniques such as GANs, and even dabbling into quantum computing, trained models in hundreds of millions images and audio clips to create astonishing visuals. NFTs have been one of the recent delivery mechanisms explored by Anadol.  Read more: Designer Eric Hu on Generative Butterflies and the Politics of NFTs  NFTs’ embedded-AI: We can use AI to generate NFTs but that doesn’t mean that they will be intelligent. But what if they could? Natively embedding AI capabilities into NFT is another market dimension that can be unlocked by the intersection of these two fascinating technology trends. Imagine NFTs that incorporate language and speech capabilities to establish a dialog with users, answer questions about its meaning or interact with a specific environment. Platforms such as Alethea AI or Fetch.ai are starting to scratch the surface here.  AI-first NFT infrastructures: The value of deep learning methods for NFTs won’t only be reflected at the individual NFT level but across the entire ecosystem. Incorporating AI capabilities in building blocks such as NFT marketplaces, oracles or NFT data platforms can prepare the foundation to gradually enable intelligence across the entire lifecycle of NFTs. Imagine NFT data APIs or oracles that provide intelligent indicators extracted from on-chain datasets or NFT marketplaces that use computer vision methods to make smart recommendations to users. Data and intelligence APIs are going to become an important component of the NFT market.  AI is changing the landscape of all software and NFTs are not the exception. By incorporating NFT capabilities, the NFTs can evolve from basic ownership primitives to intelligent, self-evolving forms, or ownership that enable richer digital experiences and higher utility for NFT creators and consumers. The era of intelligent NFTs does not require any futuristic technical breakthroughs. The recent advancements in computer vision, natural language understanding or speech analysis combined with the flexibility of NFT technologies already offered a great landscape for experimentation to bring intelligence to the NFT ecosystem.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/25/the-coming-convergence-of-nfts-and-artificial-intelligence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02277f4821482ea7fccba54d7692a028255d62d1-3888x2592.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Layer 1 is the base layer, the main network on which a cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, runs. Bitcoin’s price hit a record high last week.  SOL, the native token of Solana, a public blockchain that is backed by Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, hit a record $218.90 on Monday, according to TradingView.  “SOL was a top performer over the last few months ... [It’s] only natural for it to perform well during the next leg of the bull cycle,” Ashwath Balakrishnan, research associate at crypto research boutique firm Delphi Digital, told CoinDesk. “Crypto runs on memetics ... So what performs well during uptrends is what everyone is looking to buy.”  According to decentralized finance data provider Defi Llama, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana reached an all-time high of approximately $13.91 billion on Monday. TVL is the U.S. dollar value of the cryptocurrency committed to DeFi protocols that are built on a layer 1 blockchain.  At the time of publication, SOL is also one of the most traded tokens on centralized exchanges, according to CoinGecko. The majority of the trades have taken place on popular exchanges Binance and Coinbase.  The price rally for SOL also reflects a win for most tokens representing projects that are built for the DeFi sector. At the time of publication, prices for nearly all tokens for layer 1 blockchains were in the green for the past 24 hours, according to Messari.  “When bitcoin momentum slows down, layer 1 tokens often perform better than any category,” Delphi Digital wrote in a market report dated Oct. 21. “Layer 1s have been the best-performing tokens since the June bottom – and quite frankly, they boast the highest year-to-date returns, too.”  Bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, soared above $63,000 on Monday after dipping below $60,000 on Sunday. It hit a record high last Wednesday of $66,974.77, per CoinDesk’s data.  The bitcoin dominance ratio, which measures bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization, dropped to as low as 44.62% over the weekend, before it returned to roughly 45% on Monday, according to TradingView. The decrease in the dominance ratio in the past few days indicated that at least part of bitcoin’s momentum had shifted to other tokens.  This phenomenon is also proved by price gains of ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain – the king of layer 1 blockchains that support DeFi protocols. Ether’s price rose above $4,300 briefly on Oct. 21, according to TradingView, a level near its record high of $4,379.11 in May.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/25/solana-hits-new-record-high-as-layer-1-tokens-follow-bitcoins-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0893ba01858154fdd8c7e660fd1d2ba14b0f7e76-3892x2586.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The increase in flows came as bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surged to an all-time high of $66,974 last week.  The previous weekly record came in February, when inflows totaled $640 million. The past week’s inflows into crypto funds pushed the year-to-date total to $8 billion.  Bitcoin-focused funds dominated last week’s inflows, with a 99% share of all inflows into cryptocurrency funds. During the prior week, inflows into bitcoin-focused funds were at $70 million.  “This is a direct result of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowing a bitcoin ETF investing in futures and the consequent listing of two bitcoin investment products,” said a report by CoinShares.  On Oct 15, the SEC approved the first bitcoin futures ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, and the announcement drove bitcoin’s price above $60,000 for the first time in six months.  On Oct. 19, the ProShares ETF began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BITO.

Outflows from ether-focused funds totaled $1.4 million last week, according to CoinShares.  “This is minor profit-taking as the price closes in on all-time highs,” said the report.

42421705,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDGH,1635174743,"Porn, Mastercard Moderation and How Bitcoin Doesn’t Fix It","As huge financial intermediaries increasingly censor online content providers, decentralized technologies de-censor them. It’s not always clear which side to cheer for.  Allie Eve Knox, a sex worker who specializes in financial-related fetishes, woke up on Oct. 15 to find that of the thousand or so videos that she has uploaded to iWantClips, a site that allows models to sell adult-oriented content, only a dozen were available for sale. A week later, only a handful of others have been made accessible.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  The reason for the hold-up? iWantClips must now review every single video uploaded to its site. The new policy comes courtesy of Mastercard, which in the name of “protecting its network” now requires sites that host porn to preview material for illegal and brand-damaging content. Sites that do not comply will be expelled from the Mastercard network. (For those keeping track, this marks the first time that one of the card networks has imposed moderation requirements on a particular set of internet content providers.)  The challenges faced by streaming sites such as Chaturbate and MyFreeCams are even more daunting. Mastercard now requires them to monitor content in real-time.  In addition, Mastercard also intends to screen-out all anonymous adult content. Its new rules require adult sites to prove to Mastercard they are verifying the identities and ages of every model and co-model.  There is a double-edged nature to Mastercard’s push to protect its network. Censoring content has its merits. It prevents child pornographers and other creators of non-consensual porn from monetizing the material they create.  But Mastercard’s rules have also thrown the financial lives of legitimate sex workers such as Knox into disarray. Overwhelmed by the extra hassles and compliance burden, many of them will stop producing content. Co-models who help make legal material but are uncomfortable with the idea of a clip or cam site storing their personal information may drop out, too.  The volume of kinkier material will shrink as well. BDSM and other fetishes, though legal, will inevitably get flagged as brand-damaging by MasterCard’s beefed-up filters, thus disappearing from the vast credit card-enabled internet.  In its initial announcement of the new rules, Mastercard said it wanted to make the internet a safer place. Without access to the Mastercard economy, however, some models may end up migrating to unsafer alternatives, like in-person, cash-based sex work.  In other words, by censoring the bad, Mastercard also reduces the good, even if that is not the company’s intention.  When it comes to strictly controlling their networks, the card companies don’t have much of a choice. It is a felony to launder money. That is, to knowingly facilitate payments for illegal goods and services such child porn is itself illegal. If financial institutions like Mastercard want to avoid prosecution, they must make a bona fide effort to filter out illegal activity. And so it is imposing content moderation on adult sites.  Read more: Michael J. Casey: OnlyFans and the Threat to Free Speech  Some have complained of a double standard. Why is Mastercard requiring content moderation and universal ID requirements from porn sites but not other online content providers? After all, Facebook or YouTube both host their share of illegal content. If Mastercard sees content moderation and ID as necessary for purging its network free of unlawful payments, surely it should impose the same on these sites, too.  Bitcoin fixes this, members of the cryptocurrency community like to say. For every content provider who is censored by Mastercard, crypto can reconnect them.  And there have been some efforts to do so. In response to Mastercard’s new rules, PocketStars – an adult subscription site founded by adult star Elle Brooke – introduced a new Mastercard-resistant sub-platform called Rocketstars. Rocketstars relies entirely on crypto for payments, which saves it from having to abide by Mastercard’s standards.  Kinky material such as ABDL (Adult Baby/Diaper Lovers) and “watersports,” which probably would not have survived on PocketStars thanks to Mastercard’s stricter moderation requirements, has found a home on RocketStars. While ABDL isn’t for everyone, it is legal content produced and consumed by consenting adults.  RocketStars initially relied on MakerDAO’s dai stablecoin for payments, which uses the Ethereum blockchain. Whereas many cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, a stablecoin is pegged to a fiat currency, usually the U.S. dollar. Ethereum’s high fees were problematic, though, and last week RocketStars introduced its own native cryptocurrency, SIMP, implemented on Binance Smart Chain.  Unfortunately, asking sex workers and their customers to transact with a wildly fluctuating token like SIMP can only make for a bad user experience. A low-fee stablecoin might have been a better choice for RocketStars. Even with a stablecoin it’s hard to replace the ubiquity of the credit card.  If Mastercard censorship is a double-edged sword, crypto’s ability to uncensor also cuts both ways.  The same week that Mastercard’s new rules paralyzed iWantClips, I stumbled on DeepSukebe, a website that lets people submit fully clothed photos of women and girls and, without their consent, “nudifies” these photos using artificial intelligence. Fake nudes in hand, bad actors can blackmail and harass their innocent targets. According to a recent article in the Huffington Post by Jesselyn Cook, DeepSukebe has received millions of hits since debuting in October 2020.  DeepSukebe can’t accept credit cards. “Our project have [sic] a lot of risks that ordinary project do not need to care about,” the site administrators say. Citing the potential for deplatforming, they are “determined not to rely traditional payment system or any other platformers [sic].”  And so DeepSukebe has turned to cryptocurrency to monetize its content.  Because bitcoin and ethereum have caused “a lot of troubles” due to high transaction fees, DeepSukebe relies on bitcoin cash and litecoin. Coinbase Commerce, a tool that crypto-giant Coinbase offers to businesses so that they can easily accept crypto, processes DeepSukebe’s payments. However, Coinbase’s terms of service prohibits usage that is “illegal, obscene, defamatory, threatening, intimidating, harassing.”  Read more: JP Koning - Are Central Bankers Ready for Payments Theater?  I contacted Coinbase to find out if DeepSukebe’s usage of Coinbase Commerce violates its terms of service. A Coinbase spokesperson responded, “While Coinbase does not discuss individual cases, we will take appropriate action when it finds customers and partners violating its terms of service and breaking the law.” Not long after DeepSukebe’s payments server went down, suggesting that Coinbase had cut it off.  Without Coinbase Commerce, DeepSukebe will still be able to find ways to accept cryptocurrency, albeit via less convenient means. It can spin up its own bitcoin address or turn to a non-intermediated service like BTCPay Server.  All of this illustrates the dark side of crypto’s ability to cancel censorship. Even though cryptocurrency can help re-platform legal kink censored by Mastercard, it also gets some pretty awful content back into circulation, including the very stuff that many of us applaud centralized payments Mastercard and Coinbase Commerce for cutting off, like DeepSukebe’s fakes.  Crypto’s radical openness and Mastercard’s content moderation both have supporters. But in the end, none of this is as clear cut or obvious as either side makes it seem. The best we can hope for is that the censors do a good job. That means carefully limiting censorship to those who genuinely deserve it. It also means ensuring that innocent victims such as Allie Eve Knox are not caught up in the blast radius of bureaucratic red tape.  And if crypto reconnects those that Mastercard edits out, the best that we can hope is that for every awful DeepSukebe that benefits there is a deserving ABDL star who is also made better off.",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/25/porn-mastercard-moderation-and-how-bitcoin-doesnt-fix-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fcf2d7ca1f01074729129e0ad7524d6629eb46c0-2048x833.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The official unveiling of the eNaira – designed to complement Nigeria’s physical currency, not replace it – took place Monday; it had been announced last week.  The eNaira was developed by fintech company Bitt, whose digital currency management system (DCMS) is also behind the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank’s CBDC.  Two applications for using the CBDC – eNaira speed wallet and eNaira merchant wallet – are available for download from the Google and Apple app stores.  The eNaira was originally slated for launch on Oct. 1, but was delayed in deference to the 61st anniversary of Nigerian independence that same day.  Some 500 million eNaira ($1.21 million) have already been minted, central bank Governor Godwin Emefiele said at the official launch.  Nigeria’s government and central bank struggled with the rise of cryptocurrency in the country, leading to a ban on crypto transactions within the banking sector in February.

Crypterium, which offers a cryptocurrency wallet app and has over 400,000 clients in 170 countries, said it is “one of only a small handful of companies to have passed the [FCA] registration process” from the almost 200 that have applied.  “This registration ensures that as Brexit measures kick in, Crypterium can continue to provide its crypto wallet services, including its crypto Visa cards and exchange functions, to practically everybody in the U.K.,” Crypterium said in a press release.  Recently a number of firms such as the crypto payments infrastructure startup Ramp have also reported securing registration with the FCA.  It was reported in June that 64 crypto firms had abandoned their plans for FCA registration amid mounting regulatory scrutiny. The deadline for registration is March 31 of next year.  The Tallinn, Estonia-based company was registered as Commercial Rapid Payment Technologies on Oct. 11, the FCA register shows.  The FCA, the U.K.’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing supervisor, became responsible for crypto asset firms in January.

42375936,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDFyf,1635174367,"Institutional Investors Growing Curious on Crypto Mining but With ‘Plenty of Skepticism,’ Analyst Says","Interest from institutional investors in bitcoin and crypto mining stocks is growing, although most of these investors are still relatively new to the sector and have reservations about the valuation of mining stocks, Wall Street firm D.A. Davidson’s analyst wrote on Monday.  Analyst Christopher Brendler, who recently initiated research coverage of the crypto miners with a positive outlook, said he estimates that about 15% of the Wall Street brokers that cover the payments sector are taking bitcoin seriously now, up from about 5% at the start of this year.  “While most investors are still new to this area, there were also quite a few already involved and able to dig deep into our new coverage,” Brendler wrote.  He noted that almost all the investors who are already involved in the sector agreed with his near-term bull case for the crypto miners, but also had plenty of skepticism, mostly around valuation.  With bitcoin’s price hitting all-time-highs last week and crypto mining stocks outperforming bitcoin itself, investors have become skeptical on the valuation of the miners and where their stocks might be heading. Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain have risen about 1,500% and 600%, respectively, over the last twelve months, while the price of bitcoin rose 377% in the same time period.  “We admit traditional valuation metrics may not apply in this sector as future cash flows are exceedingly difficult to predict,” Brendler added.  However, it’s worth noting that crypto miners are highly leveraged to bitcoin prices as they derive most of their revenue from mining digital currencies and tend to hold as many of the minted digital coins as possible on their balance sheets.  Brendler’s top pick within the miners is Hut 8 Mining (HUT), whose enterprise value he estimates is trading at 4.4 times its 2022 EBITDA, a measure of the miners’ profitability. Meanwhile, most of its peers are currently trading at between 6.6 times to 9.1 times 2022 EBITDA.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/25/institutional-investors-growing-curious-on-crypto-mining-but-with-plenty-of-skepticism-analyst-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a25bd65dd7f6fc9dc92563aece25dcf72942430c-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Full thread is below: &apos;In 2008-09, when the Fed started quantitative easing, I thought that inflation would take off. I was wrong. Instead, velocity - the rate at which money turns over per year - declined, taking away its inflationary sting.

The news was first reported by The Block early on Monday. Sino Global confirmed the news to CoinDesk in an official statement.  The fund, dubbed Liquid Value Fund I, is hard-capped at $200 million, the statement said. A substantial amount of that has already been committed by partners like FTX, according to The Block.  Liquid Value Fund I will invest in DeFi, Web 3.0 and “mass consumer protocols” on Solana and Ethereum ecosystems, and will focus on projects in Asia and particularly India, according to the statement.  Sino Global’s CEO Matthew Graham tweeted earlier this month that the company was looking for interns for its interns-to-hire program in India.  Beijing-based Sino Global has invested in over 20 crypto projects according to the statement, including FTX, Solana, Serum and Mask Network.  Some of the firm’s existing investments will be purchased by the new fund at cost (i.e., what Sino Global paid for it, not the current market price), including LayerZero, Orca and Clearpool, according to the statement.  It is the first time the venture capital firm is accepting outside capital from a broad range of accredited investors, according to the statement.  FTX raised $420 million in a Series B-1 funding round last week, following a $900 million round in July.

42375954,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDGGH,1635167962,Bitcoin Pushes Upward After Weekend Dip,"Bitcoin was pushing back up Monday after experiencing a price dip below $60,000 over the weekend, down from the all-time high near $67,000 reached last week.  As of press time the cryptocurrency was up 4% over the last 24 hours, trading around $62,900.  The drop in funding rates is the most notable indicator seen over the weekend, according to Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer at Stack Funds.  “This is extremely bullish given where we are,” said Dibb.  Funding rates across major exchanges were lower over the weekend, making it cheaper for traders to take more long leverage on bitcoin. Funding rates are payments to long or short traders based on the difference between the perpetual contract market and the current price, according to the crypto exchange Binance.  When funding rates drop, it’s generally a sign there’s less demand from traders for leverage (borrowed funds) to bet on price gains – an indication the market is becoming less overheated. The lower funding rates also make it cheaper for traders to put on new leveraged positions.  Dibb said he sees the rally continuing from here and that the recent pullback was needed to cool down speculators.  Bitcoin is still down 6% from its all-time high reached last week on Oct. 20, at $66,974.77.  VanEck Bitcoin Futures ETF  In contrast to Dibb’s bullish take, Laurent Kssis, director of CEC Capital, an independent crypto financial services firm, thinks a downward trend is more likely around the $50,000 channel before the market starts to appreciate again.  The increase in price comes ahead of the expected launch on Tuesday of the third bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), from VanEck, which will trade under the stock ticker XBTF.  ProShares was the first to secure the long-awaited approval of a bitcoin futures ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and started trading last week. Another bitcoin futures ETF, from Valkyrie Investments, launched on Friday.  Alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether (ETH), solana (SOL) and Cardano’s ADA are all up between 1% and 11% on the day.

The swap follows a vote that saw over 97.5% of token-holders green-light the proposal, setting the stage for a revised tokenomic structure, new incentive mechanisms and improved block times. In total, over 93 million STRAT tokens have been converted 1:1 to STRAX, representing 93% of the circulating supply. The remainder were burned, effectively removing over 6.6 million tokens from existence.

Why Token Swap? Stratis users who failed to exchange STRAT for STRAX can hardly complain: the platform announced the changeover last October, with token-holders given a whole year to install a STRAX wallet and exchange their old outgoing assets. The high number of tokens swapped underscored the simplicity of the process, which saw users trade STRAT independently via a trustless on-chain mechanism, transfer their tokens to an exchange that supported the swap (Binance, Bittrex, Bithumb, etc), or manually swap them into STRAX using a tool provided by the platform.

Regulated futures exchange LedgerX will now be known as FTX US Derivatives, FTX.US said Monday. The deal’s close follows the launch of a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace earlier this month. The U.S. exchange’s parent company announced last week a meme-friendly raise of $420 million from 69 investors.  Some of the fresh capital (the exchange also announced a $900 million funding round in July) is set aside for bringing more firms under the FTX umbrella.  “We’ve probably done a half a billion dollars of acquisitions so far this year,” Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk last week. The financial terms of the LedgerX buy were not disclosed.  The deal gives FTX.US a slew of licenses granted to LedgerX by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As such, the exchange can move to offer crypto futures, swaps and options to U.S. retail traders.  “We believe the integration of the two organizations provides us with not only a technological advantage, but also furthers our working relationship with the regulatory community in a positive, constructive and transparent manner,” FTX.US President Brett Harrison said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/25/ftx-crypto-exchange-finalizes-ledgerx-acquisition,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Polkadot is the brainchild of Dr. Gavin Wood, who is one of the original co-founders of Ethereum and who came up with the idea of the Solidity programming language. Wood left his position as CTO at Ethereum in 2016, shortly after the platform launched on mainnet. He&apos;d already shared a vision for how Ethereum&apos;s development could pan out, but it seems his co-founders disagreed. So Wood decided to implement his vision as Polkadot, a new project. Features of Polkadot Polkadot has several features designed to make it stand out from competitor platforms. One of the most notable is that Polkadot has a kind of sibling network called Kusama, which runs on the same codebase. Kusama serves as a midpoint between Polkadot&apos;s testnets and a full Polkadot implementation. Along with the ability to experiment, Kusama is expected to remain operational as a live environment for lower value applications that don&apos;t require Polkadot&apos;s enterprise-grade security and stability.

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are one of the most important financial technologies under development, but the kingdom does not intend to phase out the use of physical cash, according to a central bank representative quoted in the report.  The central bank was one of the first in the world to experiment with CBDCs back in 2019 when it announced project Aber, a bilateral experiment with the U.A.E. to test the use of digital ledgers on cross-border transactions.  Saudi Arabia is trying to increase the proportion of electronic payments to 70% of the country’s total by 2030, but the kingdom wants to ensure continuity of cash transactions and the availability and acceptance of paper and metal cash as a means of payment, according to the interview.  The representative said the target is likely to be achieved five years earlier, in 2025.  The U.A.E. are now working on another cross-border CBDC project with China, Thailand, and Hong Kong.

In an interview with the New York Times published Saturday, Haugen said she was managing financially for the “foreseeable future” because she had bought crypto “at the right time.” The article didn’t specify what type of crypto Haugen purchased.  Haugen has also since moved to Puerto Rico to manage a health condition and to join “crypto friends,” according to The New York Times’ story.  In May, Haugen left Facebook, taking with her tens of thousands of documents that showed the company prioritized its growth over its users’ well-being. The documents exposed the social media giant’s awareness that information posted on Instagram could harm teenage mental health.  The documents also showed Facebook knew its products were spurring ethnic violence in places such as Ethiopia, and that it failed to combat misinformation on its platform relating to the Jan. 6 Washington. D.C., riot on Capitol Hill.  Pierre Omidyar, the eBay co-founder whose nonprofit groups started working with Haugen in October, was believed to be supporting the whistleblower financially. But Haugen told the Times the only help she is soliciting came via nonprofits for travel and related expenses, according to the reporting.
