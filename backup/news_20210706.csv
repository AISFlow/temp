The California-based exchange announced the move Tuesday, saying Alvarez will begin his new role on July 22. Alvarez has served at the DFPI since 2019 but stepped down last month. Earlier this year, he was rumored to be a candidate to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the federal banking regulator that Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks previously ran.      The hire comes as Binance, the firm from which Binance.US licensed its brand and technology, comes under heightened scrutiny from a number of global regulators.      ""Compliance is the key to creating trust with both our customers and our regulators, which is why we are hiring recognized leaders in the field such as Manny. He is that rare brilliant regulatory mind with a strong sense of law and compliance who also brings a strong technology and Silicon Valley perspective,"" Brooks said in a statement.      Alvarez has experience in the fintech industry in addition to being a financial regulator. Prior to his work at the DFPI, he was general counsel and chief compliance officer at Affirm, a point-of-sale lending platform.      A press release said Alvarez will ""oversee major control functions"" within the exchange, including its compliance and legal aspects. The exchange itself has added 110 other new employees on the regulatory, legal and customer support teams, the release said. Brooks said the exchange only had roughly 100 employees at the end of May.    Read more: State of Crypto: What’s Next for the OCC?

42434760,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtADh,1625607071,Bitcoin Miner Profitability Could Double After Record Drop in Network Difficulty,"Active bitcoin miners may see their profitability double following the 28% downward difficulty adjustment in mining on July 3, according to several mining sites.      The North American hash spread – an index invented by digital asset financial services platform BitOoda to measure the difference between bitcoin mining revenue per megawatt-hour and the cost of the needed power – has almost doubled to $449 from $225.      ""Mining economics have improved significantly,"" Sam Doctor, chief strategy officer at BitOoda, wrote Monday in a newsletter.      Such projections follow the record downward adjustment in the Bitcoin blockchain's mining difficulty. The adjustment process, which was coded into the network's original programming, is designed to stabilize the blockchain by incentivizing miners back to the network whenever there's a significant drop in the hashrate, which is the amount of computational activity working to secure data and finalize transactions.      China's recent crackdown on the crypto industry forced many miners to shut down, cutting the total hash power by more than half from record levels earlier this year. The seven-day average hashrate fell to 84.3 exahashes per second on Friday, before the difficulty reset, the lowest since September 2019. But it has since jumped back to about 90.7 exahashes per second, according to Glassnode.      Miners may see similar profitability levels as in April, when bitcoin was trading at nearly double its current level, according to an analysis by Glassnode. While prices are much lower now, fewer miners are splitting the revenue.      Meanwhile, as some Chinese miners have been selling their mining computers or ""rigs"" at discounts, prices for the machines have dropped. According to Luxor Mining, newer and next-generation rigs have lost 32% of resale value, while the oldest machines saw price declines of 36%.      Remaining miners will continue to see profitability boosts, until the infrastructure catches up, according to industry experts.      “It's become both easier and more profitable to mine bitcoin,” said Nick Spanos, co-founder of Zap Protocol, an infrastructure provider for decentralized apps. “That’s a recipe for enticing more miners back in.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Frances Yue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/06/bitcoin-miner-profitability-could-double-after-record-drop-in-network-difficulty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94e88ddde98bece50d5fa346329e7bcde4f81fe2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434776,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtAdh,1625604806,Didi's Downfall and the Case for Web 3.0,"It’s hard to remember a more dramatic case of market whiplash. Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing completed its U.S. initial public offering on Wednesday, raising $4.4 billion from global investors at a market cap over $67 billion. Just two days later, on Friday, Chinese regulators announced a probe into the firm’s cybersecurity and ordered Didi’s app removed from local app stores. The app store ban could last 45 days and will prevent the company from acquiring new customers, with a potentially devastating impact given the intensely competitive Chinese ride-hailing market.      Today, the first full day of U.S. trading since the moves were publicized in the U.S., Didi stock fell as much as 25% on the New York Stock Exchange, dipping below its IPO price and cutting its market cap by as much as $22 billion. The surprise haircut could have serious long-term implications for Chinese equity markets because they highlight local political risk. But that political risk might not matter if not for a technical vulnerability shared by tech companies around the world: Their massive dependence on extremely centralized app stores means their lifeblood can be cut off without warning.      It remains unclear exactly what the alternatives are for mobile developers in the short term, but these events yet again drive home the case for what’s known as “Web 3.0.” Largely but not exclusively envisioned as leveraging blockchain technology, Web 3.0 would replace the platform-dependence of today’s web with more open, trustless and permissionless systems.      That would involve its own social and economic tradeoffs, but if it reduced the power of app platforms, it could provide significant resilience for companies now at the mercy of either authoritarian governments or tech giants.      The swiftness and extremity of the move against Didi echoes the past nine months of intense tech backlash from China’s ruling Communist Party. It arguably kicked off with last year’s kiboshing of the Ant Group IPO and the forceful sidelining of CEO Jack Ma. We saw a second major episode in June with bans on bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency transactions. Even Tesla, a U.S. company with previously friendly relations with Beijing, seems increasingly on the receiving end of China’s version of techlash.      The post-IPO timing of the Didi rug pull raises even more pointed questions. It worked out well for Didi, all things considered, because the company gets to keep all that American and international money despite a suddenly extremely different business outlook. Chinese authorities had already pushed Didi to delay its IPO, and given the regulatory environment, Didi must have known serious backlash was possible if it proceeded. Jack Ma’s downfall, after all, followed a similarly defiant lambasting of Chinese financial regulators last October.      Bloomberg’s Shuli Ren hints at the possibility that Didi was somewhat knowing in its IPO defiance, happy to harvest “chives” from ill-informed Western investors ahead of imminent CCP enforcement (though the company has denied foreknowledge of the specific enforcement action). All this led CNBC's Jim Cramer to declare that after this weekend’s events, you’d have to be “a moron” to invest in Chinese tech startups.      But what’s missing from Cramer’s read is that, though Chinese authoritarianism vastly increases the risk, the same thing could happen to many of the world’s biggest tech companies. Facebook, Seamless, Uber and even Twitter’s U.S. business could be crippled if not outright destroyed in a matter of days simply by removing their apps from Google Play and Apple’s App Store, each the overwhelmingly dominant portal for mobile phone apps for the Android and iPhone ecosystems.      (In fact, probably thanks to a desire to wrest control from Apple and Google, China has a much more diverse app store ecosystem than the U.S. For instance, Tencent’s MyApp market has about 25% of the app market. In the U.S., efforts by the likes of Samsung and Amazon to create viable alternatives to the Big Two app stores have basically failed.)      It might seem implausible that a giant company like Uber could be hit by such a severe governmental action in the U.S., and it’s true that unlike China, America offers a robust and transparent system for legal appeal of any such governmental effort. But the app stores have taken dramatic unilateral action under their terms of service, as when Google and Apple banned unmoderated social media platforms Parler and Gab.      Apple even directly leveraged its censorship power for competitive purposes when it pulled Epic Games’ hit ""Fortnite"" as retaliation for Epic’s attempt to encourage payments that circumvented the App Store and its exorbitant 30% cut of revenue.      These are regulatory and political problems, of course, and some might hope new Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan will apply pressure to encourage alternatives to the Apple/Google duopoly. Those could include mandated improvements to side-loading options on phones, or more drastic moves like breaking up the vertical integration of phone manufacturing and content.      The original internet promised that old gatekeepers would be swept out of the way. Yet here we are with entirely new chokepoints for information and innovation: the app stores.

42434779,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtAjh,1625603988,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Consolidates Amid China Crackdown,"Bitcoin traded sideways on Tuesday as market participants digested the latest regulatory crackdown from China. On Monday, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) reiterated its long-held anti-crypto stance, warning institutions against providing services to crypto-related companies.      China’s announcement preceded choppy price moves around $34,000, which left traders with little sense of direction. Bitcoin trading remains in a tight range and the price is down about 6% over the past week.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $34085, -0.24%  Ether (ETH) $2326.6, +3.67%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4343.5, -0.2%  Gold: $1796.8, +0.28%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.36%, compared with 1.437% on Friday    “Our strategists continue to expect a 6%-10% correction in U.S. equities this summer given that growth indicators are peaking, as well as a further sell-off in U.S. Treasurys that will see 10-year yields hit 2.25% by year end,” according to a Deutsche Bank report published on Tuesday.      For now, risky assets are still supported by accomodative monetary policy. For example, last week, European Central Bank (ECB) executive board member Isabel Schnabel pledged to do whatever it takes to support an economic recovery, according to a Bloomberg report. Schnabel also warned governments not to end fiscal stimulus too early.

Declining volume    Bitcoin trading activity dropped significantly over the past week as the price remains stuck in a range between $30,000 and $40,000. The seven-day average of BTC daily price volume reached the lowest level since December 2020, according to a Tuesday report by Arcane Research.      “The 4th of July celebration could partly explain the slow weekend, but the appetite for trading bitcoin is certainly not very high in this range-bound environment,” Arcane wrote.      Slowing volume also reflects indecision between buyers and sellers. Bitcoin faces strong resistance from the intermediate-term downtrend since April. The current range can be difficult to navigate, placing some traders on the sidelines until a decisive breakout or breakdown is confirmed.      “We expect intermediate-term oversold conditions to give way to a relief rally and would expect buyers to step in above the 50-day moving average around $36,000,” wrote Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, in a newsletter published on Monday.      A breakout above the 50-day moving average would yield an upside target towards $44,000-$45,000 resistance, according to Stockton.    Fund flows rise    Digital-asset investment funds attracted net capital inflows in the week ending Friday, July 2, after four consecutive weeks of redemptions, according to CoinShares. Inflows totaled $63 million last week, of which nearly 62%, or $39 million, went into bitcoin-dedicated funds.

In response to a prolonged time for miners to find a new block, bitcoin’s code was automatically adjusted, making it easier for miners to solve the computational puzzles.      “It's become both easier and more profitable to mine bitcoin,” said Nick Spanos, one of the earliest bitcoin exchange operators. “That’s a recipe for enticing more miners back in.”    Altcoin roundup  Quest for decentralized stablecoin: The cryptocurrency industry won’t stop trying to make a purely algorithmic stablecoin work, according to CoinDesk's Brady Dale.

CAKE price boost: CAKE, the native token of the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap, had a 15% surge in its price after the project burned $72 million worth of its tokens on Monday. The jump in value represents the highest single daily gain for the exchange’s token since June 23.

Many Ethereum enthusiasts are excited for the delayed release, while some are watching on with “cautious optimism.”      As a part of a roadmap designed to lead up to the release of Ethereum 2.0, which will replace Ethereum’s current proof-of-work protocol with proof-of-stake, the London hard fork has been implemented into various testnets. After successful activation on the Ropsten and Goerli testnets, the final hard fork release date was decided.      The protocol update includes five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), most notably EIP 1559 and EIP 3554, that aim to counter various inefficiencies:    EIP 1559 introduces a new fee structure to make Ethereum less inflationary. This protocol change is highly controversial because it aims to burn part of the fees, hence decreasing miner revenue.  EIP 3554 delays Ethereum’s difficulty bomb to Dec. 1. This mechanism will incrementally increase the difficulty of mining on the Ethereum network, effectively “freezing” proof-of-work in preparation for Ethereum’s move to proof-of-stake.

42411915,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh50K,1625602915,What Is a SPAC? Your Questions Answered,"What is a SPAC? The highlights:  SPAC stands for special purpose acquisition company.  A SPAC is a newly created shell company formed by a group of investors called sponsors.  Sponsors raise funds for the SPAC through in initial public offering (IPO), a process in which a stake or an entire private company is publicly sold in the form of stock  The primary goal of a SPAC is simply to raise capital and then use that cash to acquire an existing private company that is looking to go public.  Private companies can then merge with SPACs and become publicly traded companies, avoiding the time consuming pitfalls of the traditional IPO process .  SPACs have been an increasingly popular option for companies looking to go public, especially during the global slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But what is a SPAC and why is everyone talking about them?  A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is a newly created shell company formed by a group of investors known as “sponsors.” Sponsors raise funds for the SPAC through an initial public offering (IPO), a process in which a stake or an entire private company is publicly sold to institutional and retail investors in the form of shares (“stock” is also used interchangeably). A share is a unit of ownership in a public company.  The first SPACs were established in the early 1990s, but they’ve surged in popularity over recent years, with an increasing number of companies seeking faster ways to go public than an IPO.  Most companies that have passed through IPOs have commercial operations, i.e., they provide some forms of products and/or services. Think about Apple, Facebook, Amazon – these are all public companies that were initially private but at some point went public. The shares of public companies are traded on special venues called stock exchanges, e.g., the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), or over-the-counter (OTC) stock markets, which represent networks of stock dealers.  Unlike regular public companies, however, a SPAC has no commercial operations when it conducts its IPO. This is why SPACs are also referred to as “blank check companies.” In other words, they do nothing. The primary goal of a SPAC is simply to raise capital and then use that cash to acquire an existing private company that shows significant promise and is looking to go public. These private firms are also known as “target companies.''  How a SPAC works  As a rule, a SPAC IPO structure consists of common shares merged with a warrant. The latter is a contract that gives the holder the right to buy more shares at a fixed price at a later date. Exercising the warrant is one of the opportunities investors try to leverage.  Most SPACs price their IPO shares at $10 apiece while the warrant exercise price tends to be around 15% higher than the IPO price.  A SPAC typically has two years to acquire or merge with a private company after completing its IPO. If it fails to do so, the SPAC is dissolved and all funds are returned to shareholders who participated in the IPO. Note that a SPAC may or may not reveal which private company it plans to acquire or merge with during its IPO process.  If a SPAC does successfully merge with a private firm, it swaps the cash it raised during the IPO and the status of a public company for a stake in the resulting business.  Differences between a SPAC, an IPO and a direct listing  Despite the success of SPACs, some companies opt for different methods to go public. For example, Coinbase recently debuted on the Nasdaq exchange via a direct listing, which is another fast-track method to become a publicly traded company rather than an IPO.  Here are the main differences of all three approaches:  SPAC  Companies seeking the support of a SPAC go public via merging or being acquired by the SPAC.  Going public through SPACs is easier and faster than IPOs. There is less regulatory scrutiny and the target company is not required to provide detailed financial information.  The fees are higher than direct listings because SPAC sponsors are interested in profiting from the deal.  Investors in the SPAC IPO may not know about the target company and the price.  IPO  Companies going public via IPOs are supported by major Wall Street institutions that have a wealth of experience in the space and help to value the company fairly.  New shares are created and sold to investors.  IPO firms have to pay considerable fees to underwriters (banks that provide guarantees to investors).  Companies going through IPOs have to host roadshows to promote their business to prospective investors.  There is more regulatory scrutiny during an IPO, including the filing of additional underwriter contracts.  Investors know the ins and out of an IPO firm thanks to financial disclosures.  Often, there is a post-IPO lock-up period during which the company’s employees cannot sell the stock.  Direct listing  In a direct listing, the company sells shares directly to investors, without intermediaries, underwriters and roadshows.  Unlike in IPOs and SPACs, companies going public through direct listings don’t issue new shares but sell existing, outstanding shares.  Direct listings are best suited to well-established businesses that have a strong market presence and do not require the support of intermediary financial firms to promote them.  Companies going public through direct listing pay much lower fees compared to IPOs and SPACs.  There is no lock-up period on shares sold during a direct listing.  Why are SPACs needed at all?  SPACs are all about speed and convenience. For operational businesses with assets, conducting an IPO is an arduous process, especially during a pandemic.  Companies have to think about the roadshow and employing underwriters – usually investment banks – to promote the public offering to prospective investors. Unsurprisingly, working with investment banks is expensive and time-consuming as additional contracts need to be filed with the financial authorities.  To avoid this, many companies, especially smaller private firms, decide to merge with SPACs and become publicly traded companies in as little as three to four months. This compares to an IPO, which can take anywhere from six months to over a year to complete.  Risks of going public via a SPAC  It’s worth mentioning that merging with SPACs has drawbacks as well. One of the main issues is that the post-merger business may not perform as expected. The Financial Times cited Refinitiv data showing that of the 13 SPACs announced acquisitions in May, 2021, only one was trading above $10.  Another issue for companies opting for this route is making sure all regulatory and legal filings are communicated before the SEC deadlines. Because SPAC mergers are typically much quicker than IPOs, post-SPAC companies have a shorter window to file all necessary documentation.  SPACs in the crypto market  SPACs have also become attractive for blockchain and cryptocurrency firms that plan to go public. In this way, blockchain companies can avoid the rigorous scrutiny of an IPO.  Bakkt: The Intercontinental Exchange-backed company that operates a bitcoin futures trading platform, announced at the beginning of the year that it would go public by merging with SAPC VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings. The deal values Bakkt at over $2 billion.  Bitfury’s Cipher Mining Technologies: Merged with Good Works Acquisition Corp.  Diginex: Merged via a SPAC with 8i Enterprises.  All in all, SPACs have been booming over the last couple of years. Stock investors called 2020 the year of the SPAC because the blank check firms raised an impressive $83.4 billion, more than in all the previous years combined. However, it took only three months in 2021 to surpass that level and update the annual record.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Anatol Antonovici,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-spac-your-questions-answered,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93b2e7ec765f48522ab0d8d5d44df400adbf1c60-2366x1267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434777,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtAfh,1625602051,Circle Isn't Winning the Stablecoin Transparency Race,"USD Coin is the second-largest stablecoin in the world. Tether, the largest stablecoin, has always been the more opaque product. But the transparency advantage enjoyed by USD Coin – issued by Circle Internet Financial – appears to be declining.      To comply with the terms of its settlement with the New York attorney general’s office, Tether is now providing the public with quarterly breakdowns of the investments used to back tether stablecoins. Tether has also started to issue periodic attestation reports that disclose the value of those investments, a practice USD Coin adopted several years ago.    Read more: USDC on Tron Blockchain Surpasses $100M 2 Days After Public Unveiling    Meanwhile, Circle is investing USD Coin customer funds in something it refers to as ""approved investments."" We have no clarity on what those investments are or how much Circle has allocated to them.      It's been over a year since Circle began to invest USD Coin funds in approved investments. Up until Feb. 28, 2020, just before the pandemic hit, Circle held all of its customer funds in accounts at federally insured U.S. banks. Products like checking accounts and time deposits would qualify. We know that from disclosures in Circle's February 2020 attestation report for USD Coin.      Regular attestation reports have become the industry standard for providing stablecoin consumers with transparency. An auditor verifies information about the investments that an issuer holds to back the stablecoins it has issued. The auditor's opinion is then published on the issuer’s website for public consumption.      In its subsequent attestation report, dated March 31, 2020, Circle added the category ""approved investments."" In short, Circle started to invest USD Coin customers' funds not only in accounts at federally insured U.S. banks, but also in a new type of financial asset.      At the time Circle made this change, the pandemic was shutting down the global economy. Short-term risk-free interest rates had collapsed from over 1.5% to nearly 0% in March 2020. Because Circle makes money from the interest it harvests by investing customer funds, its revenue would probably have been collapsing. To help compensate for the decline in short-term rates, it's a fair assumption that Circle was shifting USD Coin's investments into longer-term debt products that yield more. Longer-term securities tend to be riskier than short-term ones.      Unfortunately, Circle's attestation reports don't provide any information on the nature of its approved investments. So all we can do is guess at what those might be. Nor do we know what portion of its assets are held as approved investments – 99%? 1%?    If you're a USD Coin owner and Circle is following the rules as set out by Texas law, you can breathe a sigh of relief.    The question of USD Coin's approved investments has only gotten more pressing as it has grown. Back in early 2020 when it first began to buy approved investments, Circle had issued only $400 million in USD Coins. But now there are about $25 billion USD Coins in circulation. That's a lot. It’s almost as big as PayPal.    Read more: USDC Stablecoin Could Soon Expand to 10 More Blockchains    We have some clues into what those approved investments might be. Circle is a licensed money transmitter, having secured 44 state-issued money transmitter licenses. As a condition of granting licenses, state licensing boards typically limit the licensee's ability to invest customer funds to a list of ""permissible investments.""      For instance, a money transmitter with a Texas money transmitter license can only invest its customers' funds in very safe assets that include accounts or certificates of deposit, or both, at federally insured banks, government debt and money-market funds that invest in government debt.      That's a pretty confidence-inspiring list of investments. If you're a USD Coin owner and Circle is following the rules as set out by Texas law, you can breathe a sigh of relief. That means that Circle's approved investments are probably something relatively safe, say two-year Treasury notes. And thus your stash of USD Coins is well-secured.      New York and Connecticut have more lenient permissible investment restrictions. They allow money transmitters to invest in high-quality commercial paper, a type of short-term debt issued by corporations, as well as preferred shares of publicly listed companies.      So if Circle is following either New York or Connecticut regulations for investing a portion of its assets, its approved investments could consist of Nike preferred shares or Exxon Mobil commercial paper.      That's riskier, but not off the charts.      Things get a little more concerning under the rules of state licensing authorities in Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Licensing boards in those states put no restrictions on what sorts of investments a licensee can invest in. (I am indebted to Dan Awrey's paper Bad Money for data on permissible investment rules.)      So if Circle is using Pennsylvania's money transmitter law as the basis for defining its approved investments, it could in theory own anything. Tesla shares? S&P 500 futures? Bitcoin? Tether?      Now to be fair, I highly doubt Circle would choose to invest customer funds in risky assets. However, Circle doesn’t provide the public with any detail on which states’ permissible investments rules it is following. Without more disclosure on how to map state requirements over to USD Coin’s investments, it's impossible for outsiders to disprove such admittedly zany theories.      For someone who holds just $50 USD Coin, it’s probably not a big deal if Circle has shifted over to riskier investments. If those assets are impaired, that might mean a $1 or $2 loss on $50. But for someone who holds millions of dollars' worth of USD Coins (MakerDAO is currently the largest owner, at $3.2 billion USD Coins), then the nature of Circle’s approved investments becomes a very important question. These large and sophisticated holders need to do due diligence on their investments. Circle’s lack of transparency prevents that.      Responding to CoinDesk’s question about the nature of Circle’s approved investments, Circle told us the following: “USDC has become the world’s most trusted and well-regulated dollar digital currency in no small measure because of our adherence to strict reserve management and asset allocation policies. These are designed to exceed the demands of USDC in circulation with cash, cash equivalents and short-duration investment-grade assets consistent with our regulatory requirements and supervision under U.S. state banking laws.”      That sheds a bit more light on Circle’s approved investments, suggesting a combination of cash equivalents, perhaps commercial paper and money-market funds and short-duration investment grade assets. A step forward would be to provide additional details in its monthly attestation reports. That would mean disclosing each month what its approved investments are and how much it has allocated to them.    Put differently, in the long term the stablecoin game is a race to transparency.    Also concerning is the steady slowing down in the publication of Circle's attestation reports, as first recounted by Andrew Rennhack. Last year, Circle would typically publish its USD Coin reports 15 days or so after the end of a month. Now reports are appearing on Circle’s website almost two months late. Circle's most recent USD Coin attestation report dates to April 30, more than two months ago.      I don't think anything nefarious is occurring. The problem is that two-month-old information isn't very valuable to stablecoin consumers.      Other stablecoin issuers offer quicker turnaround. Paxos and Gemini, for instance, have already published their May 28 reports. TrueUSD leads the pack with real-time 24/7 attestations. It should be possible for Circle to pick up the pace.      A Circle spokesperson suggests to CoinDesk that USD Coin’s fast growth makes that difficult: “The timeliness of issuing attestations have been impacted by the growth in demand for USDC, and its expansion on multiple blockchains, while remaining uncompromising about thoroughness of these reviews.”      Finally, Circle recently stopped disclosing the precise amount of U.S. dollars it holds in custody, as reported by Doomberg. Circle probably has good reasons for doing so, but why didn't it disclose those reasons in its USD Coin attestation report?      In sum, USD Coin's relative transparency advantage has been declining. With a few fixes, it has the chance to win first-pole position in stablecoin transparency.      I’d suggest that it’s in Circle's best interests to shoot for more transparency. Stablecoins don't pay interest to stablecoin consumers. That means that stablecoin consumers are not compensated for the risks incurred by the stablecoin issuer’s investment decisions. And so a consumer’s decision on what stablecoin to buy boils down to a very simple rule: Only hold the stablecoins that have the safest investment policies.      Put differently, in the long term the stablecoin game is a race to transparency.

Users can build their own digital shoes, selecting between various styles for laces, soles and accessories, and then customize colors and patterns. Each choice and upgrade adds to the total cost to mint the NFT kicks, which usually run from between $50 and $150 per pair, depending on the level of customization and the price of Solana’s native SOL token.      Since launching in mid-June, 364 pairs of NFT shoes have been minted with the Sole Selector platform, with a total of approximately 590 SOL ($19,930) transacted, according to project leads. The numbers offer a snapshot of NFTs’ growth outside of their initial homebase, Ethereum.      NFT mania may have cooled but the market for digital wearables and collectibles has brought in a whopping $2.47 billion in the first half of 2021. Institutional investors are piling into the space, investing in projects that create digital wearables for online avatars and other transferable collectibles on the blockchain.    Read more: Dapper Labs, Coinbase Ventures Join $65M Investment in Avatar Startup Genies    CryptoKickers’ NFT sneakers aren’t yet avatar-wearable, though, which points to some of the technological challenges currently plaguing many metaverse projects.      But according to co-founder Thomas Dimson, the CryptoKickers team sees the tech hurdles as an opportunity to shape the future of digital wearables.      “We thought we were kind of late in this space, but we’re actually pretty early because everything is broken, especially in the metaverse space,” Dimson told CoinDesk.      “We would love for everything to be wearable. That’s our vision, that’s our goal. If you think of Fortnite, it shows there’s a clear market for digital wearables,” said Dimson. “It makes a lot of sense for that to be on the blockchain because you want things to be portable across different platforms.”    Read more: Why NFT Collector ‘WhaleShark’ Spent 22 ETH on These Sneakers    Before designing the Sole Selector platform, Dimson and co-founder Joey Flynn experimented with designing several collections of NFT sneakers on Ethereum, including a collaboration with former National Basketball Association player and crypto enthusiast Wilson Chandler.      Ultimately, however, the pair moved over to the Solana blockchain, attracted by the blockchain’s low transaction fees and fast minting speeds. The transition allowed them to develop Sole Selector, which Flynn said was intended to be a more participatory version of their earlier Ethereum project. (Note: A CoinDesk editor was gifted a pair of NFT sneakers prior to the publication of this article.)      “We’re onboarding hundreds of people to mint their first NFTs with this, and to us that’s something we’re really excited about – building these creative tools that don’t feel like you need to be super deep in crypto to partake in something that we feel is important,” Flynn said.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/07/06/cryptokickers-is-bringing-nft-sneakers-to-the-hypebeasts-of-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae6e9decf4770154b0cd250735e9eed33c7a5021-1500x904.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411942,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhERZ,1625600073,3 Crypto Chart Patterns to Help Make Sense of the Market,"Learning and recognizing patterns on price charts can help you make sense of wild crypto price fluctuations. Below are three common patterns to get you started.  In technical analysis, chart patterns are a set of recurring shapes that can be drawn on an asset’s chart by connecting price highs and lows. These formations, or “setups,” usually appear around key support and resistance levels (points where prices stopped falling or rising further, respectively) and signal a new price trend is likely to begin.  While there is much debate over why these setups form and whether they are self-fulfilling – where traders intentionally create them based on the preceding expectation they will form – chart patterns can be a reliable tool for foreshadowing one of two things:  A continuation: When a crypto asset’s price will likely continue to follow the same trajectory following a brief period of consolidation or correction.  A reversal: When a crypto asset’s price will likely reverse and move off in the opposite direction of the prevailing price trend.  The good news is you don’t necessarily need to have a great deal of crypto trading experience to be able to spot these patterns. In fact, there are a number of easy-to-plot chart patterns that are widely used by traders of all levels to identify where prices might be heading next.  1. Triple & double tops and bottoms  Triple or double top and bottom chart patterns are exactly what they sound like; when prices ricochet off the same resistance (top) or support level (bottom) two or three times consecutively.  Both triple and double patterns are reversal setups and typically signal prices are about to head in the opposite direction. A double top, for instance, is when a crypto asset is in an uptrend and prices meet a strong resistance area. During the first visit, prices bounce off it and break lower temporarily before quickly rising back up. Upon the second visit to the same resistance level, prices are forced down much stronger than before and a new downtrend begins.  If prices break above the resistance or below the support at any point, the pattern is considered negated and a price continuation will likely occur instead of a reversal.  While double tops and bottoms are far more common than triple patterns, it’s often the case that triple patterns deliver stronger reversals.  2. Ascending/descending triangles  Ascending and descending triangles are known as continuation chart patterns (bullish and bearish, respectively). An ascending triangle, for example, consists of a flat line connecting the recent price highs and a diagonal line connecting the higher price lows.  These appear when bullish traders get rejected at the same resistance level on multiple occasions but retreat less after each attempt until eventually, the price breaks through. The same goes for descending patterns, where sellers eventually overcome a base support after a number of pushbacks and prices continue lower.  3. Head and shoulders/inverse  Head and shoulder setups are another type of reversal chart pattern characterized by three sequential price peaks. Two smaller peaks (called ""shoulders') sit on either side of a much larger, middle peak (called the ""head""). The lower lows of each peak can usually be connected by a flat line, known as the ""neckline.""  Once the last shoulder forms and returns back to the neckline, the price breaks out. When all three peaks point upward, the pattern signals a bearish reversal is likely to happen. When all three peaks point downward, it's known as a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern and suggests a new uptrend is about to begin.  Chart patterns tend to form more frequently in volatile markets when crypto trading activity is high.  “Higher volatility coincides with the early stages of chart pattern development,” technical analyst Daniel Chesler said. “A more active market attracts and supports more participants, and hence more gross supply and demand – or total investor interest – than does a less active market.”  It is worth noting even during busy trading periods, no chart pattern is 100% reliable. Seemingly perfect setups can often get rejected and move in the opposite direction or push sideways when volatility is low, which is why many traders recommend waiting for confirmation of a breakout or breakdown first (at least two consecutive closes above or below) or placing stop-loss orders to mitigate this risk.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/3-crypto-chart-patterns-to-help-make-sense-of-the-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c8bf767cd1a4f88626b5d81417fbe589a6a309b-2120x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434774,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtAbh,1625597934,Leveraged Funds on CME Trim Bets Against Bitcoin,"Leveraged funds trading bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) continue to trim their short positions initiated earlier this year, mostly as a hedge against risks associated with the “Grayscale carry trade.""      The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released data on Friday that showed leveraged funds held a net short position of 10,000 contracts in the week ended June 29. That is down from about 30,000 in December and represents the lowest tally of net shorts since September, according to data source Skew.      ""This probably has more to do with leveraged funds hedging their long positions in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares using the CME futures,” said Matt Blom, global head of sales and trading at Eqonex.      “As they unwind GBTC positions during the unlock windows, and do not add further trades due to the Grayscale premium trading at a negative, we have seen the need to use these derivatives decline,” Blom said.      The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world’s largest digital-assets fund manager, allows institutional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin through shares in the trust, which currently holds 654,600 BTC. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)      Investors can buy GBTC shares directly at the net asset value (NAV) in daily private placements by depositing bitcoin or U.S. dollars. The shares can be sold in the secondary market only after a six-month lockup period.      Until February, the GBTC shares traded at a significant premium to NAV for various reasons. So accredited investors took carry trades. That means they deposited bitcoin they owned or had borrowed into the trust, and in return they got shares at NAV, hoping to offload them at a premium in the secondary market at the end of the six-month lockup period. The obvious risk associated with this type of setup is a potential fall in bitcoin’s price, or a narrowing or erosion of the GBTC premium.    Read more: Bitcoin Trims Gains as PBOC Steps Up Crypto Crackdown    As such, many carry traders hedged their risk by taking short positions in the CME futures, which are now being squared off alongside the release of the GBTC shares locked in January.      According to data tracked by bybt, nearly 40,000 GBTC shares will be released this month. Investors are expected to liquidate these shares in the secondary market, squaring off the long leg of the carry trade, and use the proceeds to buy back bitcoin to return to the base portfolio or pay back the borrowed coins.      “Funds which bought GBTC shares at NAV also took shorts in CME futures to hedge against the risk of a sell-off in bitcoin,” Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, told CoinDesk. “Now, this trade is being unwound.”      Another reason for the continued decline in the net shorts is the low incentive to take fresh GBTC carry trades. With the GBTC shares still trading at a discount of 10% to NAV, investors, particularly those with a longer term horizon, may choose to buy GBTC shares in the secondary market rather than buy bitcoin and turn it over to the trust.      “Investors looking for long-term passive bitcoin exposure are probably better off buying GBTC over spot bitcoin since you get paid to wait more via the discount than you pay in excess fees,” David Grider, strategist at investment research firm FundStrat, wrote in an email.    Read more: Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model, Rooted in ‘Hard Money’ Narrative, Goes Off Course    Lastly, the cash-and-carry arbitrage, which involves buying bitcoin in the spot market and selling bitcoin futures, has lost its shine with three-month futures premium now in the single digits. So trading firms, including the $135 million crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime, are no longer interested in taking these carry trades.      “The spread that was evident earlier in the year has evaporated, and with potential capital inflows into DeFi (decentralized finance) ecosystems, courtesy of Aave- and Compound Finance-inspired institutional offerings,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said.      “The current futures structure does not offer enough risk/reward for institutional investors to deploy their capital to.”      Many trading firms took carry trades during the height of the bull run in mid-April when the three-month futures were trading at a premium of over 20% on the CME and nearly 40% on Binance and other non-regulated exchanges.      Looking ahead, net shorts may spike if the bull returns to the bitcoin market, lifting premiums and making carry trades attractive again.

42434780,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtAhh,1625596693,Axie Profiting From Booming NFT Economy as Bitcoin Struggles,"There is always a bull market somewhere. While the crypto market might seem boring now with its rangebound bitcoin trading, the non-fungible tokens (NFT) space continues to buzz. One lesser-known coin coming out of the NFT industry has charted a triple-digit price rally in two weeks.      Axie infinity shards (AXS) isn’t an NFT per se but the governance token of the Axie Infinity platform, an Ethereum-based digital marketplace for the game Axie Infinity. AXS has nearly quadrupled in price to $11 since June 22, according to data source Messari. Such gains have given the AXS token a market value of $638 million.      While bitcoin's dip to $28,800 observed on June 22 was short-lived, buyers largely remain on the sidelines, leaving the cryptocurrency locked in the range of $30,000 to $40,000. But in the search for yield, buyers are turning elsewhere.      ""AXS has been on a tear,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said. ""With all the yield compression in bitcoin futures and decentralized finance, the hot money is now flowing into NFTs.""      Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as ""axies,"" which are digitized as their own NFTs. Per Startups Zone, new players need to buy at least three axies, while existing players are rewarded for breeding new axies.      Players can trade axies with their AXS tokens, stake their coins for weekly rewards and participate in governance voting. AXS tokens can be purchased, traded, or earned through playing the game, and their maximum supply is capped at 270 million. These tokens can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.      Also read: For Filipinos, Axie Infinity Is More Than a Crypto Game      The gaming-NFT economy has boomed in recent weeks. With a 30-day trading volume of $185 million, Axie Infinity has surpassed NFT heavyweights including NBA Top Shots, OpenSea and CryptoPunks to become the world's biggest digital marketplace, as ranked by their average daily volume over the past seven days, according to DappRadar.      What's more impressive is that Axie Infinity has generated more revenue than Aave, Compound, Uniswap, and other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols over the past 30 days, data tracked by Token Terminal shows. Axie Infinity generates revenue from axie sales, land sales, axie breeding fees and marketplace fees.      With a cumulative volume of $30 million, Axie Infinity leads PancakeSwap, ranked number two, by a margin of 48%. Curve, Ethereum's biggest DeFi protocol by total value locked, has generated only one-tenth of Axie's 30-day revenue.      The boom in the play-to-earn economy comes amid falling yields in the bitcoin and DeFi markets.      For example, borrowing rates for tether, the largest stablecoin by market value, have declined to 2.84% on Compound and 1.43% on Aave, from over 10% three months ago, according to LoanScan. Lending rates have also seen a similar decline, converging with the current 1.41% yield offered by the U.S. 10-year Treasury note.      ""With the speed at which money appears to be entering the space, the increased stablecoin supply may make it so DeFi never quite sees the consistent 10% plus yields of the last year, a trader told The Defiant.

42434756,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPt6fh,1625595072,CryptoPunks Get Punked,"The amount of money flowing into crypto art is matched only by the size of the egos involved. This was on display last week when conceptual artist and crypto gadfly Ryder Ripps sold a copy of a CryptoPunk as his own work.      His listing on the NFT platform Foundation received a copyright notification from Larva Labs, the creators of the CryptoPunk project (in 2017), raising questions about artistic authenticity and the technological limits of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). But Ripps isn't taking it lying down. He wants to make a point:      “By engaging their so-called art with the Ethereum network, they should be believers in the self-governing ideals of cryptocurrency. I question Larva Labs' motives, understanding of art, understanding of ‘punk’ and understanding of cryptocurrency/NFT,” Ripps told CoinDesk in an email.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    CryptoPunks are a set of 10,000 Ethereum-based NFTs, each token corresponding to a unique cartoonish figure. They’re glitchy. They’re kitschy. But some are also worth a ton of money. In February, FlamingoDAO bought an “ultra rare” alien Punk for $762,000. Just two days ago, CryptoPunk #1886 – a zombie character with messy hair and a beard – went for over $1 million worth of ETH. Punks have been auctioned off at Sotheby’s and Christies for millions.      Said to be one of the catalysts of the crypto art boom, Punks are sought after for their blockchain-ensured scarcity and computer-generated rarity. No two are alike. It’s that point Ripps attempted to press with his latest artistic statement, an effort to goad Larva Labs into taking copyright action, he said.      On June 29, Ripps listed an NFT titled ""CryptoPunk #3100"" on Foundation, a near-facsimile of an official punk by the same name. Ripps’s version, which sold for 2.189 ETH (~$4,620 USD), was of slightly higher resolution than the original, which last sold on March 11 for a record-breaking (at the time) 4,200 ETH (~$7,584,485).      “This work is a critique of NFT and Larva Labs,” Ripps said. In an Instagram post, he went into further detail about how CryptoPunks are devoid of humanity and have become institutionalized by traditional artistic gatekeepers – like very old auction houses. “The glimmer of what was once ‘punk’ about Cryptopunks [sic] is gone,” he wrote.    Welcome to the annoying world of conceptual art.    On July 1, Larva Labs submitted a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice to Foundation, which was forwarded to Ryder Ripps as required by law, a Foundation representative said. Hours later, Ripps submitted a counterclaim to Foundation saying his work falls under “fair use,” and minted the DMCA takedown notice as an NFT along with Larva Labs’ email.      Jason Williams, who also goes by “Parabolic Guy,” bought the work after seeing the controversy flare up on Twitter. CryptoPunk “die-hards” argue that copies would dilute the value of their holdings. Others thought Ripps’ project failed to advance the crypto art movement.      “As I started to think about it more I figured it would lead to a broader discussion around the DMCA copyright what’s real and what’s not, etc.,” Williams said in a direct message. “And I thought the punk would be very valuable since it is the first DMCA punk that Larva Labs took action against.”      There have been other punk copycat projects. CryptoPhunks, for one, markets itself as “Punks that Larva Labs does not want you to own.” The project was taken off OpenSea initially but has found a workaround for now. Then there's the mirror world series hosted on Binance Smart Chain.    Read more: What’s New Is Old | Opinion    Part of the issue is that NFTs provide buyers with ownership of a digital token, but not necessarily the work to which the token corresponds. Just as when you buy a painting, that doesn't mean you can sell the image in the painting to McDonald's to use as wallpaper in an Egg McMuffin ad. This is a boundary that Ripps has pressed in the past. Although a work of art may not improve upon or transform an original physically, which is a typical stipulation of fair use, it could be introducing a new artistic thought.      “Welcome to the annoying world of conceptual art,” Ripps wrote.

42434752,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPt6Zh,1625587556,Thriving Under Pressure: Why Crypto Is Booming in Nigeria Despite the Banking Ban,"Nigeria’s regulators tried to crack down on cryptocurrency. Now, a few months later, it’s clear their efforts haven’t worked. The nation is a prime example of how people will turn to crypto to cope with a struggling economy despite the prohibitive stance of the state.      In February, the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered banks to ""identify persons and/or entities"" who were conducting transactions in crypto or running crypto exchanges and ""ensure that such accounts are closed immediately."" But that ban didn’t stamp out bitcoin in Nigeria. Rather, the crypto community turned to peer-to-peer trades, or sending payments directly to each other.      According to the blockchain research firm Chainalysis, the dollar volume of crypto received by users in Nigeria has been consistently growing in 2020 and 2021, which may be partly related to this year’s bull market. In May, Nigeria received $2.4 billion worth of crypto, compared with $684 million last December, the analytics firm said.      While that kind of geographical data comes with caveats, it’s clear that crypto is alive and well in Nigeria.    Wealth without borders    According to a survey in March by Statista, 32% of respondents in Nigeria use crypto. Nigeria also ranked eighth in Chainalysis’ 2020 report on cryptocurrency adoption around the world.      The interest in crypto surged last fall, when activists with the “EndSARS” movement, protesting against police brutality in Nigeria, used bitcoin to raise funds.      Economic factors also appear to spur adoption.      “Recently, the devaluation of our local currency [encouraged] people [to start] saving in crypto assets like bitcoin and ethereum,” said Udeaja Kingsley, CEO of the BiTA crypto startup, adding that the crypto users are “mostly the youths that believe in it and are trading it via the means of P2P.”      So far in 2021, the Nigerian naira has been losing value with the country’s inflation rate at 18%. While U.S. dollars might be hard to obtain in Nigeria, bitcoin sometimes serves as a proxy for the dollar, allowing people to hedge against naira’s inflation. Because most of the goods Nigerians buy are imported, U.S. dollars are in high demand and there is often not enough of them available on the market.      However, some of Nigeria’s importers already switched to crypto as a payment method, says Keith Mali Chung, president and co-founder of Loopblock Network, an African blockchain firm. “Over 70% of all that is being consumed in Nigeria is imported, and with financial restrictions, bitcoin is gaining all the attention it deserves,” he said.      Chinese merchants selling clothing and electronics in Nigeria are using crypto as a means of exchange, Chung said. The pattern is similar to the one in Eastern Europe, where Chinese merchants might be sending tens of millions of dollars in crypto across the border daily.      Read more: Millions in Crypto Is Crossing the Russia-China Border Daily. There, Tether Is King      It’s hard to estimate how much money is moving from Nigeria to China this way, Chung said, but he has some anecdotal evidence. “I know of individual [merchants] who transact over $2 million to $5 million daily, and they are countless, and the numbers are rapidly increasing,” he said.      According to Chung, some young Nigerians view bitcoin and smaller, newer cryptocurrencies as a way to make some money as the traditional economy lags because of the pandemic.      “A lot of people are taking advantage of the [decentralized finance] industry right now, it’s giving equal financial opportunities for all, irrespective of nationality or whatsoever,” Chung said. “A lot of people are jumping into different yield farming programs, I know quite a number of people who got DeFi loans to run their businesses,” he added.      Ray Youssef, CEO of Paxful, a service that enables users to buy and sell bitcoin in a peer-to-peer fashion, believes the biggest factor of crypto’s popularity in Nigeria has been “the intense drive and business aptitude of the Nigerian youth.”      “Entrepreneurship is baked into their DNA,” Youssef told CoinDesk via a spokesperson.    Frozen accounts    The Nigerian government, and the Central Bank of Nigeria in particular, haven’t been openly hostile to crypto. Commenting on the controversial banking ban during a public event in March, Adamu Lamtek, the central bank’s deputy governor, said the regulator had never banned cryptocurrency activity in Nigeria altogether; rather, it only prohibited banking services for crypto businesses.      For some crypto firms on the ground, however, Nigeria’s reality remains tough.      Luno, the crypto wallet owned by Digital Currency Group (also CoinDesk’s parent company), has had fiat deposits and withdrawal frozen since February, it said in a recent statement by the CEO Marcus Swanepoel.      Although the company managed to get its bank account in Nigeria unfrozen in June, users still can’t move their fiat funds to and from the platform, Swanepoel said, adding that the company “intensified regulatory lobbying” to get the issue sorted out.      “We are negotiating day and night with the relevant stakeholders in Nigeria to get them to collectively work with the government to find a solution that works for everyone,” he added. “This includes the CBN and other crypto platforms, and allowing people to withdraw is the main priority.”      Chike Okonkwo, sales and partnerships lead in Africa for an asset manager Thresh0ld, and also a member of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SiBAN), said the crypto community has been trying to talk with the central bank, but hasn’t heard back so far.      He says SiBAN, along with other two organizations, Blockchain Nigeria User Group and Cryptography Development Initiative of Nigeria, has been working to get on the same page with regulators for a while.      “We have been having meetings with the [Securities and Exchange Commission, the country’s securities regulator] before the CBN ban news but due to the fact that the CBN did what they did, the SEC had to pause their own plans,” Okonkwo said.      Read also: Nigeria Protests Show Bitcoin Adoption Is Not Coming: It’s Here      Nigeria’s SEC announced in February that it’s putting on hold its own plans to regulate crypto because of the CBN’s ban.    P2P boom    Crypto communities world-wide have found ways around government restrictions, and Nigeria is no exception.      According to Paxful's Youssef, after the Central Bank of Nigeria banned crypto-related bank transfers in February Nigerians sent even more bank wires purchasing bitcoin than before. Paxful is “on pace” to have 23% more trades funded with bank transfers in Nigeria than last year, and 36% more in terms of volume, Youssef said.      Nigeria is the largest market for the company, with around 1.5 million users and over $1.5 billion trading volume, according to Paxful.      According to UsefulTulips, in the first half of 2021 the volumes of two major P2P platforms in Nigeria, Paxful and LocalBitcoins, were the largest in Africa, totaling over $200 million.      During the first five months of 2021, Nigerians traded 50% more than the same period last year on LocalBitcoins, said Jukka Blomberg, LocalBitcoins’ chief marketing officer, adding that new registrations have also increased this year.      That activity may be at least partly explained by the fact that P2P trades are not easy for government officials to trace. When people send money directly from one personal account to another, without channeling it through a third party, it’s hard to see how exactly individuals are using the money. It could be for bitcoin they purchased from someone, their apartment’s monthly rent or paying back a debt to a friend.      It would thus be difficult, if not impossible, for banks to ""ensure that such accounts are closed immediately,” as the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered.      Turning to peer-to-peer transactions might actually make the crypto ecosystem in Nigeria healthier and more resilient, according to Yele Bademosi, CEO of the Africa-focused crypto app Bundle.      “In my opinion, we got too comfortable about the fact that we were relying on centralized rails and channels to on/off ramp crypto,” Bademosi told CoinDesk. “In the ethos of bitcoin, P2P methods are more resilient as they don’t have a central point of failure.”      Read also: Bitcoin ‘Can’t Be Stopped’: Nigerians Look to P2P Exchanges After Crypto Ban      Nigeria is part of a larger regional trend. Africa has seen a wild 386.93% increase in P2P trade volumes on Binance since January, according to Damilola Odufuwa, Binance’s spokeswoman in Africa.

42434753,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPt6Xh,1625583126,Fashion Redefines Finance: The Logic of Digital Luxury,"We’re not cool. That’s why we’re in finance.      But people want to be cool. As highly social and intelligent animals, we want and need to belong, differentiate against each other and negotiate for status. We create signals and hierarchies to create pockets of relational capital, which we then cash in for real world benefits.      Such mammalian realities are contrary to the economic rendering of the homo economicus, the abstracted rational agent making choices in financial models. In 2021, our financial models are waking up and instantiating themselves, becoming decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), spun up by decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) industry insiders, and implemented into commercial actions on-chain. Behavioral finance finds edge cases where reason ends and our hormones take over. Then we can add (1) the democratization and commoditization of everything, and (2) technologically accelerated fashion and luxury.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    One intuition is to sell things to as many people as possible and to make those things as cheap as possible. This is the intuition of an ""attention economy,"" created and warped by the last two decades of internet advertising and venture capital blitz-scaling logic.      This is also the complete opposite of what you want to do with a branded, luxury good.      Then, you want to sell as few things as possible, and for as much as possible. That means instead of having everyone running around with your product, making it commonplace, a select few will be the beneficiaries. When everyone else is excluded, the beneficiaries accrue cultural capital. They are admired for their “having,” and it is precisely the “lack of having” on the behalf of everyone else that makes the luxury thing valuable.      Taken together with a brand narrative – a qualitative and consistent messaging about personal values that the brand represents – this creates intangible but highly valuable brand equity. That brand equity is destroyed with actions like cutting price or making the luxury goods feel less exclusive to access. This negative is what is highly priced in the first place.    Read more: Why Ethereum’s Price Is Built on Firmer Ground Than Bitcoin | Lex Sokolin    These days, it is no longer mere exclusivity and price that drive purchases. Instead, emerging luxury brands and goods have to connect to the “zeitgeist,” the cultural heart of the global conversation. That might mean being backed by the largest musician or sports influencers. See the neobank Step being backed by TikTok megastar Charli D’Amelio, or the green finance company Aspiration get funding from Drake, or the cryptocurrency exchange FTX working with Tom Brady.      Purchasing social clout from the right people, plugged into the right story, will turn whatever goods you make from commodities for consumption into emotional avatars for the owners. If your target audience is price-insensitive, then you should charge their maximum willingness to pay, as well as protect their purchase by pricing out people who are not like them. That is partly why some limited editions NFTs, CryptoPunks, have been accruing unbelievably value.      As practical finance people, some might be wagging their fingers right now at irresponsible investing practices. What kind of pixelated asset allocation is this, one might ask? But that is entirely the wrong question – one about money, financial planning and mathematical outcomes.      The right question is instead about the size of the luxury market. Knowing what we do about the preferences of the human animal, let’s measure how these preferences are commercialized today. Bain tells us that people are spending $1.2 trillion per year on luxury goods, of which $34 billion is fine art and $550 billion is cars.      Within that, the luxury goods market is around €300 billion ($355 billion) per year, growing at nearly 8% annually. It is no surprise that such trends would make their way into our digital world, as the digital world reformats physical reality into the metaverse. There is nothing especially rational about people that find themselves on the internet – they are just as impulsive, tribal and mercenary as those in the physical world.    The function of fashion    It’s a big opportunity, and there is one more attribute we want to highlight, which is the connection between luxury and fashion. Let’s review the microeconomics of exclusive goods:    What do you do if the demand for a high-priced luxury good is not there? The right answer is not to discount and sell to the masses. Rather, it is to destroy the unsold inventory.  What do you do if the demand for your high-priced luxury good is extremely high? Do you create more prints or permutations? Nope. You raise the price of access so that fewer people can afford the special status.    But it is hard to build a business with recurring revenue on such grounds. You do not know the state of demand, or how successful the brand's positioning is going to be. Mistakes are irreversible. And there is no reason for engagement from the millions of losers (in the sense that they are not winners of some auction) if the exclusive thing is permanently defined and permanently owned by the elite.      Fashion makes things popular and then unpopular. It catalyzes consumption. That means that if you did not hit the right notes this season, there is always another season. Turnover creates hope for the masses and a constant need to re-invest by those with high status to keep their status. Therefore, revenue becomes recurring. The artistic or cultural value of the object from the prior season is no longer guaranteed as being in style in the following season. Further, there is a motion around a creative process, and an engagement around the unveiling of new creative outcomes. You can have an entire industry of stories, brand narratives and collaboration with non-exclusive participants.    Read more: Story from Markets OPINION Kim Kardashian and Ethereum Max. Why? | David Z. Morris    And that is now exactly what we are seeing with digital objects.      NBA TopShot was extremely popular early in the year, and is materially slowing down. Axie Infinity, a blockchain insider collectibles game, is gaining some real steam. CryptoPunks have cemented their position as the premier luxury asset for crypto avatars, and their price is rising and falling with the rest of the markets. Demand for some projects, like Art Blocks, is rising organically. Other things are almost poisonous in how uncool they are, like some common CryptoKittys we hold.      All these sentiments are likely to flip, twist and change as the social hive processes new thoughts and positions on its own evolution. They are not market bubbles selling vapor to unsuspecting investors. Rather, they are art fashions, some of which may be everlasting Mondrians, while others are meaningless decorations that will fade over time.    Takeaways    As Silicon Valley's ethos and technology permeated finance, one hypothesis was the fear of media companies becoming financial companies – see Google. But something else is happening, too. Financial products and financial distributors are taking on media DNA. They are natively social and sentiment-oriented. They are massively retail, transactional and FOMO driven.      All of this brings us back to DAOs (see this article by Linda Xie or our 2018 meditation on the topic). The early DAOs are almost entirely financial in nature, coordinating the running of DeFi protocols. New entrants resemble either investment syndicates, artistic communes or some beast in between. But they all have the glue of internet culture and memetic connection between them. Unlike regular organizations, they are born of technological utopia even if some day anchored in human law.      Because DAOs anchor to the blockchain world, which enforces digital scarcity, they must manage the concepts of luxury and scarcity that we’ve explored. Code and data have no cultural meaning, and thus that meaning must be manufactured by a social layer of people organized for the purpose.      Not everyone can afford to be a market maker. But lots of people can govern the protocol that allows market making, create stories around it and profit from keeping it fashionable. Not everyone can buy an NFT. But lots of people can pool together to do it, while also building a meta-influencer entity that signals the cultural relevance of the purchased object. With this alchemy, a DAO could turn seasonal financial fashion into timeless investment art.",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Lex Sokolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/06/fashion-redefines-finance-the-logic-of-digital-luxury,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15bef481425368ad1e843a87a3449bcddd4ce4dd-1390x938.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434754,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPt6bh,1625580618,"State of Crypto: Yes, We're Still Talking About Regulatory Clarity","A subcommittee within the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on recent trading and volatility within the crypto markets last week that largely appeared to be a fact-finding mission and exploration of this relatively young marketplace. Interestingly enough, witnesses both from the crypto industry and from outside the space agreed some form of increased regulatory clarity is needed.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  What is regulatory clarity anyway?  The narrative    We keep seeing the phrase “regulatory clarity” come up during congressional hearings around crypto investing, central bank digital currencies and what possible regulations around this industry could look like. But what does that phrase actually mean?    Why it matters    Businesses and proponents within the crypto industry see vague regulations as a major issue preventing startups from succeeding in the U.S. Lawmakers are hearing this, too. It’s not yet clear what the result will be, though.    Breaking it down    I’ve talked about regulatory clarity a few times in this newsletter. In the U.S. at least, it’s sort of this ideal framework in which companies in the industry know what qualifies as a security versus what is for sure a commodity or what circumstances would allow a company to sell tokens or pay employees using cryptocurrency, etc. In other words, regulatory clarity would entail companies knowing what exactly they are allowed to do.      So why aren’t we there yet? The chief issue is there isn’t a single federal regulator that can provide this oversight (or is willing to). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates everything else, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates banks and national trusts and individual states decide to which exchanges to give licenses, etc. (this is a bit of a simplification).      The witnesses at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the crypto market last week advocated differing approaches to this issue, but the overall conclusion is clear: Regulators need to actually issue some sort of concrete guidance around what activities are allowed, or legislators need to give one entity the authority to do so.      We’re seeing this refrain more and more, especially with the recent bull market.      “One regulator says that a crypto asset is a currency. Another said that it is a security. And the outcome of that is incredibly harmful to retail customers,” said Christine Parker, one of the witnesses at the hearing. “This lack of clarity stifles innovation in the U.S. and frankly drives retail customers to foreign exchanges. So how do we better regulate cryptos?”      Parker, a partner at Reed Smith LLP, advocated for Congress to require the SEC and CFTC to provide clearer rules.      “I don’t know if there’s a right way or wrong way but we need to do something,” said Perianne Boring, the founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, after the hearing.      The solution may lie within existing laws, but with better and more consistent enforcement, said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.).      Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center and one of the witnesses at the hearing, indicated that some regulators have already begun demonstrating how existing laws apply to the digital asset industry.      “Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum are commodities but many crypto assets meet the flexible definition of an investment contract and are therefore securities which means their issuance and their trading are regulated by the SEC. Cryptocurrency derivatives are regulated by the CFTC,” he said.      Still, the tone of the hearing was generally positive, industry insiders said.      “Today’s hearing was a good example of months of education on Capitol Hill. Both Democrats and Republicans asked good pointed questions in regards to securities law, regulatory clarity, consumer protection, ransomware and fostering innovation in the U.S.,” said Ron Hammond, director of government relations at the Blockchain Association. “This hearing was unique in terms of the number of Members of Congress who were vocally supportive of the technology and application of cryptocurrency versus those who were skeptical.”      Boring noted that Rep. Maxine Waters’ (D-Calif.) participation in the hearing is “a strong signal” that the overall committee is continuing to focus on crypto.      “It did seem more like a fact-finding mission,” she said.      In a statement, Coin Center Director of Communications Neeraj Agrawal said the think tank was “pleased to see that so many members of Congress” have continued researching the sector.      “Our best bet for sound policy outcomes is a broad understanding of these technologies,” Agrawal said. “The growing number of policymakers knowledgeable about cryptocurrency is a good sign.”    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    Still nothing has really happened this week.

Huobi Reveals Countries Where It Has Halted Derivatives Trading: Huobi has barred customers from the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong and several other countries, and barred existing customers in a number of other nations from trading derivatives. It’s this last bit – derivatives trading – that I think is really worth watching as FATF guidelines continue to be implemented and regulators investigate this sort of activity.

Additionally, four out of 10 respondents said they would increase their crypto holdings dramatically, with fewer than one in 10 saying they would reduce their exposure.  Among reasons for increasing exposure, 58% cited the long-term capital growth prospects of crypto and digital assets. Over a third of respondents said it was because of either feeling more comfortable with the asset class (38%) or the improving regulatory environment (34%).  A recent example of the latter was a new law in Germany permitting ""special funds"" – the dominant institutional investment vehicle in the country – to hold up to 20% of their portfolios in crypto.

China's central bank closed down a Beijing-based company providing software services for virtual-currency transactions and reiterated that no institution under its jurisdiction should engage in such transactions.  Bitcoin fell from $35,100 to nearly $34,000 after the news started doing the rounds on Twitter.  Both the PBOC and the Chinese government stepped up their anti-crypto rhetoric in May, adding to bearish pressures around the cryptocurrency.  China's crypto restrictions have been dominating the headlines and taking a toll on market sentiment since mid-May.  The National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association, and the Payment and Clearing Association of China published a note on May 18, confirming a ban on crypto services and initial coin offerings originally implemented in 2013 and 2017.  In June, China's Qinghai province banned virtual currency mining. The crackdown was later extendedto the southwest province of Sichuan.  According to some observers, China's mining ban has dramatically reduced competition for block rewards and improved the profitability for miners based elsewhere.  However, China's mining crackdown is a one-off event, meaning most of the hash power will return, eventually boosting competition and difficulty. There are reports of miners banned in China moving to Kazakhstan, Russia, and the U.S.  Bitcoin's sensitivity to negative news flow out of China has declined in recent weeks. The cryptocurrency appears to have stabilized near $34,000 at press time after the initial decline.  While similar comments rocked the market in the second half of June, bitcoin buyers were able to defend the psychological support level of $30,000.

Sales in the second quarter were $1.24 billion, only slightly eclipsing the first-quarter figure of $1.23 billion, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing DappRadar data.  The figures dwarf those of first-half 2020, when NFT sales totaled $13.7 million, Reuters said.  This surge represents the explosion in interest around NFTs in the last 12 months, buoyed by platforms such as NBA Top Shot, which have enjoyed considerable popularity.  The figure for total sales also varies depending on which transactions are included. DappRadar's figure contrasts with NonFungible.com's calculation of $1.3 billion. Neither site tracks ""off-chain"" transactions, which must be added manually to their data and can lead to disparities.  It is not clear whether NFT sales have peaked.
