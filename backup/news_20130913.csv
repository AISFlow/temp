42397226,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAanzBt,1379088925,Founder of bitcoin exchange BitBox on compliance and banks,"Kinnard Hockenhull is the founder of BitBox, a US-based exchange and provider of bitcoin-related services. The company is FinCEN registered and BitBox was accepted into the most recent class at Boost VC, a venture capital firm and startup incubator located in downtown San Mateo, California.  Boost VC's Adam Draper has invested in Coinbase and has a focus on bitcoin-based businesses: of the 17 start-ups in Boost VC’s current summer class, seven are bitcoin-related startups.  Participants in the incubator such as Hockenhull live and work on the same block, which has its own living space in the form of a renovated hotel and is located across the street above Draper University, an affiliated school that focuses on entrepreneurship and accepts bitcoin for tuition.  During my visit to Boost, I talked with Hockenhull and heard his perspective on Mt. Gox, regulation and what the future of bitcoin might look like.  CoinDesk: Are you seeing a lot of business with what has been going on with Mt. Gox?  Kinnard Hockenhull: It’s really hard to say. There’s no way for us to do analytics on that sort of thing. We did conduct a survey and we found that most of our users have used one other bitcoin exchange before. It’s probably not always Mt. Gox, but my guess is more often than not, it is.  What is your competitive advantage as a bitcoin exchange?  KH: That’s kind of complicated and that’s where my job gets very difficult because we’re not actually an exchange. Being an exchange is just one of the things that we do. Some of the other things we are doing are a little bit more nascent and are in the works. From the beginning, our intention has been to build a firm that is vertically integrated into the economy. The reason why we chose to do an exchange first is one of the problems we saw was that people needed to get bitcoin.  One of the biggest problems in bitcoin is still actually obtaining it.  KH: There are things going on here at Boost that are going to make getting bitcoin a lot easier. We’re working with Gliph (another Boost startup), for example, to try and make it easier.  You indicate on your website that you are FinCEN compliant. What does that actually entail?  KH: You basically have to go to the FinCEN website and register as a money transmitter.  That’s it?  KH: It’s actually a fairly straightforward process. The complexity comes in on the state level, if the states do decide to consider bitcoin exchanges as money transmitters. There is a huge misconception that just because you’re a money transmitter on the federal level that doesn’t make you one on the state level. That’s where the difficulty and the massive regulatory costs come in.  Because you’d have to do something for every single state, based on whatever their laws are.  KH: Right, and pay a lot of money.  Is that a threat?  KH: Well, I think that I wouldn’t call it a threat, but I think it’s very much an impediment to doing business. Especially for startups. So coming up, for me, is what we estimate to be a $1.5 million cost to get money transmitter licenses in the states where it’s required, which is kind of absurd.  Just to start a business.  KH: Right, exactly. We’re not doing that much business yet. And the way the laws have been written, they are not commensurate with the amount of business that you’re doing. Even if you’re just doing $1,000 of business, you still need to go and get the $100,000 bond. So there’s a little bit of a disconnect there.  You introduced me to the company Standard Treasury. Banks are into something like that, aren’t they?  KH: Standard Treasure is still new. They just had a demo day a few weeks ago. So, we’ll see. But yes, hopefully they do like it, because otherwise dealing with them (banks) will be like hopping on a time machine. For example, the Internet Archive Credit Union: while they were very friendly to bitcoin companies initially, their technology was not a pretty sight.  It was old?  KH: Yes. It presents problems when you’re trying to do a service at scale. When you’re doing hundreds of deposits a day, or potentially more, you can’t enter them all by hand and provide a good service to your clients. The interfaces that exist right now broadly across the banking industry are not sufficient.  Why wouldn’t a bank just hire someone like Charles Lee, the founder of Litecoin, and build a system just like Bitcoin inside of the bank?  KH: I think that there is the potential for that sort of thing. I’ve actually talked to some people at the US Treasury about something called Fedcoin but what it really comes down to is that bitcoin is a currency of choice and people will only use it if they find value in it. So I think there are certain issues that could come up as a result of a government having an unfair advantage.  Do you think that bitcoin is actually something that I’m going to be able to go down to the store and use without having to think about it? Or is the banking system going to go, ""This is a good idea, let’s use that money-moving component of it""?  KH: Banks may not have that choice. Most of the world’s population at this point is unbanked. And more and more of these people are going to have cell phones. They aren’t going to need a bank. They aren’t going to ever imagine getting on the time machine and going back to the period where they would need a bank. Africa is probably the best example.  [All of the Boost VC startups will be having their demo day on September 19. Thanks to Kinnard Hockenhull of BitBox for taking the time to give this interview. - Ed]  What do you think about bitcoin and the banking industry? Do you think that banks and bitcoin can coexist?

42397227,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAanzDr,1379083045,"The worst swear word, a risky business, and playing by the numbers","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 13th September 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  High hopes from a low country  Like a fledgling revolutionary state, bitcoin is desperate for international recognition. And, as with many such states, the rest of the world is carefully chewing over the implications of any such acknowledgement. So the latest lukewarm-to-positive statement from Belgium’s finance minister that BTC looks mostly harmless has brought cheer to many coinistas.  Belgium is a strange place. A quick look at its history may help explain why it’s not uncomfortable with the idea of a new (and basically strange currency) and what to infer from the announcement.  Both bitcoin and Belgium are new, synthetic and have no shortage of conflict and drama in their histories. The state of Belgium came into existence in the 19th century much as a new particle comes about in the Large Hadron Collider: by repeatedly smashing together other states until bits fall off. The territory has the dubious status of hosting the most (and bloodiest) conflicts in European history, mostly by dint of being at the crossroads of just about every family feud going.  It is home to two very different peoples: the Dutch-speaking Flemish and the francophone Walloons. So, following one of the most gruesome exercises in imperialism and a central role in the two bloodiest global conflicts ever, it was very ready to be one of the six founding members of what was to become the EU. Then, it decided to practically pull itself apart and is now competing with Italy for the most enduring and least comprehensible political crisis in living memory.  And yet, it prospers. From being known as ‘the cockpit of Europe’, in reference to the hole in the ground where cockfights took place, it’s now much closer to the aviation definition than the poultry one thanks to its position as the spiritual and bureaucratic helmsman of the Union and other legal entities. It’s perhaps understandable that jaw-jaw is now far more to the taste of its people than war-war. If ever a place has earned the right to be considered boring, Belgium is it.  So: a healthy disdain for politics, a strong liking for reinvention, a pragmatic sense of how to keep the tills ringing and an instinctive feel for how a small border nation can influence the goings-on of much older, bigger and more powerful neighbours.  That sounds like a useful and apt friend for bitcoin to have, even if the place has little detectable bitcoin activity itself. And if that’s not enough, Douglas Adams once declared “Belgium” as the single most powerful swear word in the galaxy, the use of which is completely unacceptable everywhere except on one tiny planet where they just don’t know what it means.  Diss Belgium at your peril.  Kraken up  All of which helps explain why baby cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has opened trading not in dollars, pounds and yen but euros. It wants, says San Franciscan founder Jesse Powell, to be the first fully legal exchange in America, but you know... regulators... What you gonna do?  Well, Powell said that investors are more interested in a company that’s up and running than one that’s fully legal and although there’s no intention to ‘slip under the radar’, ultimately, he thinks that users are more excited by funky features than boring old compliance.  Up to a point, Lord Copper. Whilst John Law very much appreciates brash talking by punk rockers to Power, he also notes that only certain classes of investors and users will remain unperturbed by a lack of demonstrable legality in a business proposition. Regulators do notice such nuances - after all, it’s a high-stakes game - and there’s a fine line between chutzpah and carelessness.  On the other hand, as Carrie Fisher said, everything is negotiable. There are plenty of successful businesses - indeed, successful markets - that have enthusiastically pushed against the boundaries of acceptability until the rules are rewritten in their favour. Sometimes you get rich. Sometimes you get porridge. It’s not unknown to get both.  One thing that unites those who go on the offensive and win is that whether through luck, instinct or sheer smarts, they get their timing right. There were MP3 players before the iPod. Smartphones before the iPhone. Tablets before the iPad. However you wouldn’t have got much bang for your buck by investing in any of them and, like so many digital pleasures, even Apple products are still not clear of the big guns of the content providers. Once upon a time, those guys liked to complain that the vast majority of music and movies copied into such things were done so illegally. In that instance, people didn’t care for the fine details of the law (and not just any old people neither).  Whilst the content providers look set to lose the war in the long term, in the short term their lobby has won many victories thanks to a vigorous, expensive and ongoing campaign. But it takes an awful lot to overhaul an entrenched system full of big, powerful players: mostly, it requires lots and lots of people who agree that funky features are more important than unimpeachable legality. It doesn’t hurt that the content industry has displayed the moral correctness of a barbarian chieftain in its own contractual dealings: few feel they’re destroying a city of light when they download Miley Cyrus.  Powell’s big question, then, is whether there are enough folk who share his features-over-legality view about bitcoin to give his stance some heft against the biggest, meanest and least-scareable lobby in town: government finance.  But are there really that many of those folk out there yet? John Law fears not. There are other, less hopeful explanations for why someone running a start-up wants to push for revenue and investment right now. Plus the view from San Francisco has been out of sync with the world before. However, John Law wishes success to Powell and everyone else shaking their fists at the castle, as long as they follow an old rule: you can live outside of the law as long as you’re honest.  Keeping it honest  Continuing in the theme of honesty, John Law feels strongly that advertising should always be legal, decent and truthful. With that in mind, here’s an unabashed advertisement: the mighty minds behind CoinDesk have made two new things happen on the site this week and you are more than welcome to help yourself to both.  The first is the signing-up of Jon Matonis, Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, as Contributing Editor, which is about as horse’s mouth as you can get without being a veterinarian dentist. As someone with as good a claim as anyone to be a recognisable face of bitcoin and one, moreover, that is comfortable in the halls of power, he’s highly likely to be something of a lightning conductor for whatever electrical storms gather, and it’s good to have a tap on that particular powerhouse.  Yet publications hire high-profile contributors all the time. Rather fewer set up shop as a global economic indicator - Dow Jones and the Financial Times have their indices - but if the people CoinDesk writes about have a certain chutzpah, then why not the site itself? Thus the Bitcoin Price Index, CoinDesk’s own, independent and reassuringly serious-minded tracker of the actual value of the cybercurrency.  You can read the thinking behind it on the launch announcement, or just head on over to the price page itself. The idea for the index was born well before the site launch but getting it right in a market that’s quite so rapidly changing in both size, importance and basic composition wasn’t an overnight task. And it’s not a fire-and-forget site gimmick: it’ll be tended with care, don’t you worry.  Like the currency itself, it is predicated on openness both in how it’s created and how it’s used, and is something that has a clear role to play in the future of digital currency. It’s also driven by the itch that someone needs to do it - and who better?  Chutzpah. It’s contagious. Honest.  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude. He has returned to write for CoinDesk on the foibles of digital currency.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,John Law,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/13/the-worst-swear-word-a-risky-business-and-playing-by-the-numbers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e95e25a04fa42ca1405942a4a9a4664f92b8f41-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397209,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAanyw9,1379078148,CoinTerra and HashFast flesh out ASIC miner product lines,"ASIC mining firms CoinTerra and HashFast have updated their product offerings as they jockey for position in the 28 nm hardware space.  CoinTerra announced a new entry-level unit and slashed the price on its flagship ASIC miner whilst HashFast announced a higher-performance unit to complement its smaller device.  CoinTerra’s  new 1 TH/s TerraMiner II, based on the same GoldStrike1 chip as its 2 TH/sec TerraMiner IV, will sell for $3,499.  January batches of the firm’s TerraMiner IV have been priced at $5,999 for January delivery to customers. At the end of last month, CoinTerra had already cut pricing on the December batch of the TerraMiner IV from $15,750 to $13,999. This latest reduction means that those willing to wait a month for shipment will get the units 57% cheaper.  CoinTerra's competitor, HashFast, has also been fleshing out its product line. It initially offered its 400 GH/sec BabyJet ASIC miner for $5,600, creating a nominal price of $14 per GH/sec ($11 if, as reports suggested, the device could be overclocked to 500 GH/sec).  While CoinTerra fleshed out its product range with an entry-level unit this week, HashFast moved upmarket, announcing its Sierra unit. Intended for datacenters, the Sierra features three of the firm’s Golden Nonce chips, offering a nominal 1.2 TH/sec. The firm promises power consumption of under 0.65 W per GH/sec.  HashFast, which initially offered its miner protection program as a mandatory feature with its BabyJet, is now offering both the Sierra and the BabyJet either with or without the protection. The program offered to add more hashing power for customers who failed to see an ROI in bitcoin terms on units over a three-month period.  Without the insurance, the 1.2 TH/sec Sierra costs $9,500, compared to the 1 TH/sec TerraMiner II’s $3,499. Adding the protection will increase the Sierra’s price to $14,000.  Second-batch 400 GH/sec BabyJets can now be purchased for $3,500 without miner protection. Adding insurance costs another $1,500 but the grand total still comes in at $600 less than HashFast was charging earlier this month.  Some miners prefer to pay less and not get the protection, explained HashFast’s VP of marketing John Skordenis, adding that batch one customers didn’t have the option to buy without the protection. “Our pricing was more than competitive during batch 1, even without the miner protection program,” he said.  Sierras sold without price protection cost $7.92 per GH/sec. TerraMiner II units will cost $3.5 per GH/sec. However, the Sierra’s more expensive price comes with a time advantage: while Sierras will begin shipping in November, TerraMiner II customers will have to wait until January.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MINING | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/13/cointerra-and-hashfast-flesh-out-asic-miner-product-lines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94738baffe531708b60fa94934ab352003ce2045-1027x670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397216,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAanz23,1379065554,Israeli government reportedly mulling bitcoin tax,"The Israeli government is considering taxing profits on bitcoin, said an Israeli paper this week.  Business paper Globes reported that the Israel Tax Authority is mulling the prospect, believing that people who make profits from bitcoin owe taxes.  ""We cannot ignore this phenomenon which one way or another involves financial transactions and therefore we are examining its importance,"" an Israel Tax Authority source was quoted as saying.  But a model for taxing profits was unclear, given that the country has not yet recognized bitcoin as an official currency, said Globes.  Jonathan Rouach, CEO at Israeli bitcoin exchange Bits of Gold, agreed. “I think the Israeli Tax Authority is not avant-garde enough to have a company go 100% bitcoin,” he said. “They still need to know what bank account they can levy taxes from, and they won't take them in bitcoin, yet.”  Bits of Gold signed a partnership last month that allowed it to exchange the currency legally in the country. He now says that he is in talks to help shape future regulation.  Ron Gross, Tel Aviv-based founder of cryptocurrency portfolio tracking software BitBlu, argued that bitcoin taxation would be a good thing.  “People and companies who want to follow the correct regulation mostly do not know what that regulation is, and there is nobody today that has provided any official answers to that,” he said. “I see the tax authority’s move to tax bitcoin as legitimizing it.”  Israel’s stance on bitcoin has been patchy. Banks, for example, have been ambivalent about the cryptocurrency, in some cases reportedly limiting or refusing payments. But some industries have embraced it. The Israel Bar Association said last monthhttp://www.forexminute.com/bitcoin/now-israeli-attorneys-can-accept-payment-in-bitcoin-for-their-legal-services-9056 that bitcoin was on the way to gaining acceptance as a means of payment for lawyers.  “Formal regulatory bodies have mostly ‘pleaded the fifth’, so to speak, regarding bitcoin,” argues Meni Rosenfeld, founder of still-down exchange Bitcoil, and an advocate for the bitcoin community in Israel. “There has hardly been any clear statement or action from them.”  Israel is a vibrant environment for bitcoin activity. Rouach, Gross and Rosenfeld have all been involved in starting an Israeli chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation, and there are also several startups, including Rosenfeld’s. The regional bitcoin meetup group can get up to 160 attendees. Israeli retailers are also starting to accept the cryptocurrency. And other exchanges, such as bit2c.co.il and bitgo.co.il are helping to create market liquidity.  But more is needed, says Gross. “We need at least one commercial bank to let go of its fear of progress, and start innovating in regards to bitcoin. Simply not blocking transactions would be a great start,” he said. “Fidor Bank in Germany decided to partner with the German exchange,” he said, arguing that its stocks subsequently rose. “There is a lot of potential here.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/13/israeli-government-reportedly-mulling-bitcoin-tax,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2394d8d2f9c51dd903f4bd14d9cbe075e71d97a2-1000x583.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
