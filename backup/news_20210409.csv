The SEC published a public notice Friday announcing it would begin evaluating the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, which the ETF giant filed with Cboe BZX Exchange. WisdomTree first filed for this ETF last month, but has previously attempted to launch a regulated financial product with exposure to cryptocurrencies.  A bitcoin ETF would provide retail and institutional investors a chance to invest in a regulated financial product incorporating the world's oldest cryptocurrency, without requiring them to invest in the crypto directly. This is seen as a potentially safer way to gain exposure to the still-young crypto sector, which can be volatile or frothy at times.  This is the second active bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application the federal regulator is evaluating in the U.S. The first, filed by VanEck, has been under review for a few weeks, with its initial comment period closing on Friday. As of press time, only five comments had been filed.  The regulator's initial decision on whether to approve or reject, or otherwise continue evaluating VanEck's application is expected to come next month.

The SEC has blocked all attempts at launching a bitcoin ETF to date, rejecting over a dozen applications in past years. Despite that, many expect an ETF to be approved for the first time in the U.S. in 2021.

42386448,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBT6kP,1618001083,Communitas Capital's 'Infrastructure-First' Investing Approach Is Paying Off With Coinbase and Others,"“We didn’t set out to create a crypto fund,” says Doug Atkin, managing partner of venture capital firm Communitas Capital. “We’ve just moved that way organically.”      The investment theme for former Instinet CEO Atkin and his two Communitas co-founders – Tom Glocer, former CEO of Reuters, and Duncan Niederauer, former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange – is building market infrastructure. In other words, providing the picks and shovels that, bit by bit, shift the paradigm.      Following this theme has led these three on a journey that has included early-stage backing of soon-to-list cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to recent investments in hot tickets like zero-knowledge proofs company StarkWare and back-end provider Alchemy.      “I’d call our thesis ‘pattern recognition,’” said Atkin, the driving force behind Instinet's dominance in electronic trading in the late 1990s that led to the firm’s $464 million initial public offering. He also ran Majestic Research, an early pioneer in using big data to provide key insights to the world’s largest asset managers.    Read more: Dapper Labs Taps Alchemy to Give Boost to Blockchain Powering NBA Top Shot    Similar patterns that existed in the transformation of equities markets are repeating for cryptocurrency. On the other hand, because crypto began with retail investors (rather than evolving from institutional to retail like traditional markets), this has led to fragmentation and many trading venues. What’s at stake right now for crypto are things like getting a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (EFT) over the line in the U.S.      “The decentralization of markets is good”, said Atkin, “but you need software in the middle to bring all these exchanges and marketplaces together.”      It’s really about what crypto needs to become a true asset class, and that’s infrastructure, said Glocer.      “That means things like real end-of-day data, sound asset management strategies, ways to keep things safe and in custody. So all the things that you needed in the equities markets,” Glocer said.    Communitas history    Founded three years ago, Communitas Capital was the formalization of what Atkin, Glocer and Niederauer had been doing informally together for years. The hat was passed around, $20 million was raised and now the firm has made 17 investments. Communitas is now about to go out and raise its second fund.    It’s very natural in Silicon Valley history to only talk about how brilliant you are with the good ones. Back up the truck, and you’ll see all the other ones that I thought were really smart and have blown up.    The firm’s more recent investments, following once again the need-for-infrastructure thesis, are right at the intersection of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the currently exploding non-fungible token (NFT) craze.      “Alchemy is kind of like DevOps for DeFi and NFT developers,” said Glocer. “The guys really impressed me. It was a bit like when I met up with the Coinbase team. The Alchemy guys were in their 20s and seemed to have half of Stanford investing.”    The Coinbase moment    Prior to the launch of Communitas, when Glocer was starting out as an angel investor, he was lucky enough to join Coinbase’s 2015 Series C.      “I was introduced to the Coinbase founders, who were thinking early-on about issues I care about such as market structure and price transparency. I was so impressed I asked if they would make an allocation available for me. And that's how Coinbase happened,” Glocer said.    Read more: As Coinbase Listing Nears, Analysts Pitch Valuations From $19B to $230B    Thanks in no small part to the current crypto bull charge, shares in Coinbase are expected to list at around $350 apiece, catapulting the exchange into the $100 billion ranks of big-ticket IPOs like Airbnb and Uber.      Glocer, who also joined early rounds for LendingClub and TransferWise, remains humble about his fortuitously timed investments, however.      “I think it's very natural in Silicon Valley history to only talk about how brilliant you are with the good ones,” said Glocer. “Back up the truck, and you'll see all the other ones that I thought were really smart and have blown up.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/09/communitas-capitals-infrastructure-first-investing-approach-is-paying-off-with-coinbase-and-others,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ccc5688dfa9d454ba5d9ddaa35dd16460d33f1e-1500x1025.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386457,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBT6qh,1617999784,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stuck Around $58K; Monthly Volatility Drops to 3-Month Low,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $58,386.28 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 1.11% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $57,486.10-$58,880.82 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price action has been less exciting as the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded in a narrow range between $55,500 and $60,000 over the past week.      Bitcoin’s spot trading volume on the eight, mostly-U.S. crypto exchanges tracked by CoinDesk drifted even lower on Friday from the previous day, slightly above $1 billion at the time of writing.      The lighter volume also suggests retail traders in the U.S., unlike in 2020, are not as active with their latest round of $1,400 stimulus checks from the federal government.      Bitcoin’s struggle to retest a key resistance level at $60,000 has “dampened” market sentiment, said Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKEx Insights.      “Until bitcoin breaks $60,000 and consolidates above it, we are likely to continue seeing traders buy weakness and sell on strength instead of holding assets for longer periods and waiting for a bigger move,” Naseer told CoinDesk.      While bitcoin may have failed to break above $60,000 a few times, it has nonetheless found strong support at the $55,000 price level the past week.      What’s more, it appears that bitcoin miners have also started accumulating their coins for the first time since December, according to blockchain data at Glassnode, a bullish sign for the market.      Meanwhile, the BTC/USD pair’s one-month realized volatility has fallen from a peak of 114% in February to about 62%, the lowest level since the end of November.    Ether and altcoins  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,078.08 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 0.98% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,045.05-$2,100.23 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Ether’s recent price gains seem to have cooled down in tandem with bitcoin’s lackluster performance lately.      The star of the alternative cryptocurrencies (“altcoins”) on Friday was again xrp (XRP). The token used in Ripple Labs’ payments received another endorsement from analyst Peter Brandt, who said XRP could hit new all-time highs in the coming months.      The token has rallied in recent weeks, erasing losses suffered in December when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a case against Ripple Inc. charging the company raised $1.3 billion by selling XRP as an unregistered security. Several crypto exchanges delisted XRP from their platforms after the lawsuit was filed.      Other digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly flat or in the green Friday.

42386447,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBT6ht,1617995601,Daniel Loeb's $17B Hedge Fund Is Keeping Crypto With Coinbase – And Maybe Even Staking It,"Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb’s “deep dive into crypto” last month led his $17.6 billion hedge fund to a familiar place: a custody deal with Coinbase.      Loeb’s Third Point LLC now holds cryptocurrency from five of its funds with Coinbase, according to regulatory documents obtained by CoinDesk. Some tout billions of dollars in underlying assets, but it is not clear how much of that is in crypto, which assets, or for how long they’ve invested.      With less than a week to go before Coinbase’s Nasdaq debut, the custody tie-up underscores how Brian Armstrong’s nine-year-old firm has transformed itself from a bitcoin-only digital wallet into a massive vault for Wall Street’s crypto bets.      Coinbase revealed it held $122 billion in institutional assets during this week's voluntary earnings call. It expects “meaningful growth” driven in part by custody revenue in the year ahead.      CoinDesk reported earlier this week that fellow hedge fund titan Paul Tudor Jones is also a Coinbase client, offering a glimpse at the deep-pocketed investors behind the exchange’s institutional assets under management.      Third Point did not respond to CoinDesk by press time.    ‘Deep dive’    The hedge fund’s true exposure to crypto assets remains more opaque. In a brochure accompanying the March 31 filings, Third Point said it can invest directly in cryptos or indirectly through derivatives contracts.      Notably, it is open to staking and lending any cryptos as well, the documents say.      “This is the first big traditional hedge fund that I know of that is doing staking,'' said Tim Ogilvie, who runs a company called Staked that provides staking services to institutional investors, after reviewing the documents.      “On the one hand I'm surprised. On the other hand I'm not surprised,” he added. “If you want to hold a crypto asset that is proof-of-stake I think you have a fiduciary responsibility to stake.”      Proof-of-stake blockchains like Tezos, Cosmos, Solana and others reward token holders with payouts akin to interest for securing the network with their contributed holdings.      Institutional investors are slowly waking up to staking, Ogilvie said. With staking there are two gains generators: the token price and the staking payout. It’s a guaranteed reward on top of a speculative bet. Ogilvie said there are $4.5 billion in crypto assets on Staked.    Third Point invests    Loeb has never publicly disclosed his crypto holdings. But he began to toy – at least publicly – with the asset class in an early-March tweet.      Third Point’s own foray into crypto likely started well before. In mid-March the asset manager revealed it is backing crypto exchange eToro, which, like Coinbase, is gearing up for a Nasdaq debut.    Read more: Hedge Fund Manager Daniel Loeb Says He’s Taking a Crypto ‘Deep Dive’    eToro’s SPAC deal (it is going public through a merger with FinTech Acquisition Corp.

42386436,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBT6VJ,1617991007,"The Node: Bitcoin, Warts and All","Last week, Human Rights Foundation executive and Bitcoin evangelist Alex Gladstein tweeted that a recent article in Wired UK threatened to set back the cryptocurrency's cause, by working in a well-worn and what he considers overdone, genre: bitcoin crime stories.      The article, “The bitcoin terrorists of Idlib are learning new tricks,” written by CoinDesk alumna Rachel-Rose O’Leary, examined how Syria-based jihadi are using encrypted tools like cryptocurrencies and Telegram to further their cause. This isn’t a new trend. What’s different is, with increased surveillance of their operations, there’s less open discussion about crypto among terrorists. They’re going further underground.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Bitcoin’s strength comes from being an open-access tool. Anyone, anywhere can transfer BTC to anyone, anywhere. Its emergence was a revolutionary moment in the history of money. It prevents governments and private companies from meddling in the basic human need to transact. Humanitarians, laypeople and criminals alike benefit.      “Bitcoin's non-discriminatory nature should be celebrated,” Gladstein said. His main issue with the article, primarily its headline, is that by focusing on the criminal application of Bitcoin, Wired is providing yet another reason for governments to attempt to stymie adoption.      Gladstein thinks in this instance the data in O'Leary's article doesn't support a sensationalist headline – he did the math, and the ""bitcoin terrorists"" only transacted about $10,000 in BTC two years ago. But it's also indicative of a general anti-Bitcoin stance in the mainstream press.      His criticism is context-dependent. Of the 18 articles Wired UK has published on Bitcoin, almost all – except for a glowing profile of the Winklevoss twins – were “negative,” by his reckoning. This is all the more relevant given “the significant history of using terrorism as a pretext for cracking down on civil liberties.” Just recently, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen called the illicit use of cryptocurrencies a “growing problem.”      All this may be true, but it may miss the larger story of what Bitcoin means for the world. It also over-emphasizes the power of the media to shape reality in the year 2021, especially the reality about Bitcoin, which famously doesn't care what people think it is or isn't.      In a phone call yesterday, Gladstein made reference to a media establishment that largely ignores how Bitcoin is being used as a means of emancipation by those who were born under the yoke of authoritarianism. There is a clear anti-Bitcoin bias in the mainstream press, he said.      I am doubtful that an article, or even the entire media establishment, could harm Bitcoin adoption. The media is simultaneously over- and- undervalued. Overvalued, precisely because of the control some think it exerts in influencing – rather than simply reflecting – public opinion. Undervalued because, well, the collapse of the industry speaks for itself.    Unstoppable    The first time I heard about bitcoin on Reddit I thought it was cool, downloaded the source code to mine some, never did and then forgot about it. The first time I bought bitcoin was to purchase a grey-area good on the clearnet. When my unspent UTXOs started rising in value, I took a closer look. It wasn’t until I read an article in New York Times Magazine that I fully understood what was going on.      I’d wager there are many adoption stories like mine. As Gladstein noted, the majority of Bitcoin’s users “aren’t on Twitter,” even fewer read Wired. Adoption comes from utility. People stay either because they can make money, or they become ideologically aligned. From Turkey to Morocco, across Latin America, Asia and Africa, real people are finding value in crypto. These stories are told in numerous publications, not least of all in CoinDesk.      The same attributes that make Bitcoin a tool for fostering self-reliance also provide a boon for criminals and despots. North Korea has a sanctions-busting crypto stockpile. And, yes, Al Qaeda, ISIS and Hamas have taken advantage of direct, unstoppable and irreversible payments. There must be a reason why “RC” (research chemicals) sites offer discounts on purchases made through cryptocurrency.      O’Leary noted in her article that only a small fraction of crypto payments are for criminal activity, citing Chainalysis research. But the criminals are here, and to say otherwise is to obfuscate the power of Bitcoin.      “Bitcoin doesn’t care what you write about it. Bitcoin is unstoppable,” Gladstein said. Negative articles ""damage people’s ability to use it, it scares them away – whether they are in advanced economies or in places like Syria.”      It’s possible that when Bitcoin was young, less known and less accepted these negative portrayals might have sunk the project. Satoshi thought WikiLeaks would draw regulatory attention. But now, Bitcoin has a patina of respectability. Publicly traded firms are buying BTC, insurance companies are betting on it and some of the most influential people are singing its praises.      As much as external criticism won’t bring the network down, there is an internal series of conflicts among bitcoiners that could harm it. Gatekeepers, so-called “maximalists” and those who chill criticism have done their damage. I know smart people who turn away from BTC after being dragged on Twitter.      If greater adoption is the aim, then we might as well tell the truth about what that world would look like. The whole truth. ""Uncensorability"" means more freedom — and more terror. That's the point.      That may be a world many would prefer not to live in. O’Leary showed, to some extent, that world is already here.

42386454,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBT6pR,1617989361,Money Reimagined: The Coinbase Catalyst,"The week was all about Coinbase’s booming first-quarter revenue results, which delivered an ideal precursor to the public listing of its shares next week. The news inspired this week’s column on how that much anticipated event will feed investor demand for other crypto projects.      After reading it, check out this week’s “Money Reimagined” podcast. With guests Rebecca Liao of Skuchain and Aditya Menon of Tallyx, we dive into the nerdy but vital field of trade finance.      Without letters of credit, global trade would not happen. (And you thought the Suez Canal was important.) Yet, millions of suppliers worldwide are unable to tap into the trade finance industry’s highly complex, opaque system of risk management. It’s a problem Skuchain and Tallyx are trying to solve in different ways. Blockchain projects like theirs offer a healthy reminder that beyond the razzamatazz of crypto markets and celebrity non-fungible tokens, meaningful impact is possible if you work hard at the core problems faced by real-world entities.    Coinbase FOMO Opens Door for Crypto Startups    Following its spectacular Q1 earnings report Tuesday, Coinbase’s historic stock market listing next week – which some estimates value at $100 billion – will likely stir investors to seek out alternative bets on “this crypto thing,” opening a new fundraising opportunity for startups in the space.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    It’s FOMO, among VCs...      This is a version of the “fear of missing out” that afflicts venture capital investors and which, in the process, drives tech development. A wave of crypto FOMO is poised to infuse yet more money into the crypto startup community – arguably the hottest hotbed of innovation right now – as these early-stage investors seek out “the next Coinbase.”      Valuations are rising across the industry…      Kraken, a crypto exchange, is raising funds at a valuation target of at least $10 billion – making it a “decacorn” – and Blockchain.com recently raised $300 million at a $5.2 billion valuation.      Money is flowing into NFTs....      Non-fungible tokens pioneer Dapper Labs, the team behind the wildly popular NBA Top Shot platform, recently closed a $305 million round including a Who’s Who in professional basketball as investors.      And DeFi could be next…      Although the end of last year’s “DeFi Summer” slowed the once booming VC inflows into decentralized finance, the Coinbase FOMO effect could now revive them, for two reasons:    Coinbase said in its SEC filing that DeFi presents a risk to its centralized business, which means adventurous investors could see decentralized exchanges as the New New Thing.  A potential symbiotic boom in the nexus of DeFi and NFTs.    But will the same VCs win again?      With their “old boy club” connections, Silicon Valley’s money men often act as gatekeepers, which means the path to a mega-initial public offering isn’t very democratic. Small investors are excluded from profitable ventures and startups’ access to funding can be more about who you know than what.      The ICO alternative to that model failed…      During the 2017 run-up, some touted token sales as a way for both startups and small investors to bypass the Silicon Valley old guard. But the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s crackdowns against unregistered securities offerings to unaccredited investors put a stop to that. Wealthy, accredited investors continue to hold a built-in advantage.      There’s a new alternative…      It’s called the “fair launch,” an idea pioneered by DeFi developer Andre Cronje, who did not reserve for himself or his co-founders any pre-launch tokens for the Yearn protocol they developed.      It’s supposed to level the playing field…      The approach means founders aren’t easily accused of pumping their books or – in a theory admittedly untested by law – of selling a security. All players – the founders and their supporters, big or small – only make money in the token if they buy it after launch and its price rises.      That has spawned the idea of ‘fair launch funding’…      Cronje’s approach so impressed Ian Lee of IDEO CoLab Ventures that he launched the “Fair Launch Capital” initiative, inviting DeFi investors to help with pre-launch outlays for code audits and bug bounties. This no-strings-attached funding, Lee argues, improves the wider DeFi ecosystem and, as the rising tide lifts all boats, boosts the value of all their holdings.      Time will tell whether this radical approach to making a profit catches on. But if it works, and the Coinbase FOMO money flows into such projects, then maybe those who want crypto innovation to proceed can get their cake and eat it too: the money needed to drive it and a fairer distribution of the opportunities that flow from it.    Off the charts: Bitcoin’s more perfect market    Among the many wonderful charts Shuai Hao contributed to CoinDesk Research’s Q1 Review , this one about the progression of bitcoin issuance since the cryptocurrency’s beginnings stood out to me.      The yellow line shows total bitcoin supply shaping as it should, leveling off as the “halvings” every 210,000 blocks reduce the size of the reward distributed to miners from 50 down to its current 6.25 in more or less four-year intervals.      But look at the blue lines, which show the variance of total daily issuance, and how that narrows over time. That trend speaks to the idea that the bitcoin mining market is becoming increasingly efficient, which makes it more secure and predictable and improves bitcoin’s status as a store or value.      A key point here: the Bitcoin protocol’s periodic difficulty adjustment, which alters the proof-of-work puzzle miners must solve to close out a block and keeps average block time running as close as possible to 10 minutes, is not perfectly in sync with changes in the hashing power to which it responds. Instead, the protocol takes stock of hash power every 2016 blocks and then tweaks difficulty up or down accordingly.      During that interim period, miners have an opportunity to add more hashing power, with more and/or more efficient machines, and gain an advantage over others to proportionately win more rewards. But the advantage only lasts until enough competitors have also added more hashing power to exploit the same discrepancy and, in doing so, removed it.      The fact that variance in daily bitcoin issuance has gotten thinner over time shows this periodic window of opportunity has narrowed because the new miners’ advantage keeps getting competed away. In other words, Bitcoin is getting closer and closer to a perfect market.      The story here is a big one: As the Bitcoin network grows – with rising prices, a rising user base, and rising hash power – the competitive economic system that drives its underlying security model is evolving toward an ever-more efficient state. It’s an excellent example of how the right incentive system can foster behavior that improves the functioning of a decentralized system.    The conversation: Thiel’s China weapon    Peter Thiel said what?      The billionaire investor’s off-hand remark at the Nixon Foundation event – yes, there is an entity named after the disgraced U.S. president – spurred an angry response from bitcoiners. How dare a guy who’s supposedly all in favor of bitcoin malign it this way!      But maybe Thiel had a different agenda…      I tend toward the latter interpretation. Contextless takes on social media lose the nuance.      If Thiel had said, “I do wonder whether China is using Bitcoin as a financial weapon against the United States,” rather than suggesting Bitcoin might be a Chinese financial weapon, it could be more easily read as a shrewd assessment of geopolitical reality.      It wasn’t a critique of Bitcoin but a reminder that by its mere existence, as a decentralized alternative to the existing financial system, Bitcoin poses a challenge to all governments but especially to the world’s financial hegemon, the U.S.      It’s a legitimate argument that China is selectively applying policies around Bitcoin that could heighten the pressure the U.S. faces from that challenge while protecting its own closed financial system. How else to explain why Beijing turns a blind eye to so much domestic mining activity – which contributes to Bitcoin’s systemic efficiency gains, described above – but restricts cryptocurrency exchanges?      So, no, Bitcoin was not created as a Chinese weapon. But that doesn’t mean China isn’t choosing to use it as one. And if so, it’s probably a good idea for the U.S. government to listen to Thiel and figure out whether to fight that weapon or co-opt it for its own defenses.    Relevant reads: ETH’s ATHs    Unlike the bitcoin market, which has failed to hold a break above the psychologically important $60,000 level, ether is enjoying an ebullient April. On Thursday, Ethereum’s native token hit a new all-time high of $2,153, and as of publication remained comfortably above $2,000.      As per this April 2 account from CoinDesk market reporter Omkar Godbole, the first impetus for the gain in ETH was something fundamentally important: the big news that Visa would start processing Ethereum-based USDC stablecoin payments.      Yet, there were also signs the ETH breakout was accompanied by a lot of sentiment-driven buying of other cryptocurrencies, activity that seems more detached from fundamentals. In particular, XRP hit a two-month price high in the wake of the ether rally, as Godbole also reported.      This is the same token that’s under investigation by the SEC for being an illegal security, and yet folks are buying it. You can’t blame ether for this rather incongruous behavior. It’s just unfortunate that strong ETH gains often coincide with broad-based “altcoin rallies,” moves that tend to feel more like momentum pumps than sustainable gains.

42386453,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBT6oB,1617986038,"As Coinbase Listing Nears, Analysts Pitch Valuations From $19B to $230B","In a sign of the extreme range of opinions on cryptocurrencies, not to mention the uncertainty and risk of investing in the 12-year-old industry, analysts are estimating values for next week's Coinbase stock listing at anywhere from $230 billion to one-twelfth that amount.      New Constructs, an investment research firm, estimates the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange's valuation should be closer to $18.9 billion. Delphi Digital, a digital asset research firm, calculates a Coinbase valuation between $160 billion and $230 billion if the stock can command above-average price multiples. Earlier this week, the brokerage firm DA Davidson estimated the market cap at $90 billion.      Coinbase's direct listing will trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker COIN on April 14, and the event is increasingly seen as a watershed moment for the fast-moving industry.      One crypto exchange, FTX, has even tried to capitalize on the speculative fervor around the Coinbase stock debut by listing a ""pre-IPO contract"" designed to allow market participants to bet on the initial share price. It's up about 16% for the month to date to a value of $499, implying a valuation of around $103 billion, assuming an estimated 266.2 million shares outstanding.    “The price of COIN will fluctuate greatly depending on forward guidance and growth expectations as well as the valuation multiple it winds up commanding,” Delphi Digital wrote.  The research firm also stated that “it’s not implausible that the stock could trade closer to 15-20 times forward sales, which would imply a roughly $172 billion-$230 billion total market value.”  Maintaining high valuations will depend on Coinbase’s ability to attract millions of new users. Verified users grew 23% between 2018 and 2019 and another 34% between 2019 and 2020, reaching 43 million in Q4 of last year, according to Delphi. (That verified user count jumped to 56 million at the end of March 2021, according to Coinbase’s earnings call on April 6.)  Growth in new users contributes to margin growth and overall profitability. Coinbase estimates $1.8 billion in total revenue for Q1 2021 on $335 billion in trading volume, the exchange said Tuesday.  However, Delphi cautioned that COIN could be subject to market risk, especially if growth stocks continue to struggle relative to value peers. “Valuations for growth stocks are trading at significant premiums relative to historical averages,” writes Kevin Kelly, partner at Delphi.    According to the New Constructs report, however, Coinbase ""has little-to-no-chance of meeting the future profit expectations that are baked into its ridiculously high expected valuation of $100 billion.""    “The crypto markets are very young and we expect many more companies to compete for the profits Coinbase enjoys today. As the cryptocurrency market matures, we expect Coinbase’s transaction margins to drop precipitously.”  “The 'race to the bottom' phenomenon that took place in late 2019 with stock trading fees will likely make its way to the crypto trading space. We expect Coinbase competitors to cut their trading fees to zero in an effort to increase market share.  “Competitors such as Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken, Binance and others will likely offer lower or zero trading fees as a strategy to take market share, which would start the same ‘race to the bottom’ that we saw with stock-trading fees in late 2019. Similarly, if traditional brokerages begin offering the ability to trade cryptocurrencies, they will most certainly cut down on the unnaturally wide spreads in the immature cryptocurrency market.”    According to New Constructs, Coinbase would need to produce compounded annual revenue growth of 50% over the next seven years. Yet, Nasdaq's greatest 10-year revenue growth rate was just 21%.      Assuming a rate of 21% and slight profit-margin compression, COIN shares would be worth just $18.9 billion, the report argues.

42434150,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8aBh,1617981386,Visa and PayPal Can Be the Cosmos and Polkadot of CBDCs,"Just over a week ago, one action by payment giants Visa and PayPal moved cryptocurrencies out of a mere “speculative asset” zone into clear “currency” realm. While much has been said about this development, the future potential of these players is even more significant in the central bank digital currency (CBDC) world than with cryptocurrencies.      When Bitcoin was launched, no cryptocurrency project focused deeply on interoperability. Fast forward 12 years and a vast array of interoperability plays have developed – Cosmos, Polkadot, Chainlink and others. Similarly, CBDCs are at their nascent phase currently, with very few live projects and pilots. Fast forward a few years and interoperability is poised to become perhaps the most major bottleneck for CBDCs.    CBDCs face a challenge of interoperability    With the coronavirus pandemic pushing the use of contactless payments, central banks all over the world are rushing to experiment with CBDCs. The domestic capabilities required for CBDCs are already complex, but globally bridging the gap between various CBDC initiatives and existing financial infrastructure is a mammoth challenge.    Tanvi Ratna, a CoinDesk columnist, is the founder and CEO of Policy 4.0, a research and advisory body working on new policy approaches for digital assets.    CDBCs will need to share compatible technology, code languages, and standards, to achieve full functionality. Standardizing legislative structures, harmonizing regulatory discrepancies between jurisdictions, and ensuring CBDC's legal tender status is another major dimension of interoperability challenge.      Recent research by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and other bodies proposes various models such as a multi-CBDC bridge between different central banks using wholesale CBDCs. A common theme in central bank experiments involves the use of “corridor” networks for real-time, cross-border settlement between CBDC transactions.      One conclusion has been that there is a requirement for a modern SWIFT-like system – a consensus process by a third-party mediator between two distinct CBDCs that can verify cross-chain transactions, ensuring transaction information is compatible with data on both sides of the transfer. This will ensure that state transfer laws, such as anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, are followed while avoiding the problem of double-spending. CBDCs may require a common technical interface or even a shared clearing system between local systems. Enter payment players.    Payment players provide real interoperability    In the internet era, as businesses, merchants and governments moved to digital payments, Visa already cracked the infrastructure and interoperability requirements to process payments between them. Its flagship solution, VisaNet, interoperates between the layers of government in 200 countries, 15,000-plus financial institutions, 46 million-plus merchants and businesses and over 3 billion card holders.      Today it is the world’s largest electronic payment network, with robust capabilities in both domestic processing as well as cross-border processing. All of these become essential when it comes to the CBDC landscape.    Read more: Visa May Support USDC Credit Card After Adding Circle to ‘Fast Track’ Program    PayPal is a different sort of payment company but in its own way performs an interoperability function. While Visa is primarily a payments processor, PayPal runs one of the world's largest e-commerce payments networks with over 377 million active users and merchants. With a focus on online and mobile payment wallets for consumers, it is offering more products and an omni-channel experience. PayPal acts as a gateway for a variety of merchants and payment processors to plug in, including card players such as Visa and Mastercard. In recent years PayPal has also been focused on creating interoperability among digital wallets, physical stores, online stores and other products such as discount finders.      CBDC interoperability is a harder challenge to solve than blockchain interoperability because it requires tackling both complex engineering and complex regulations. Apart from adoption, speed and scale, the real advantage for these players is not their systems, but that they are legally-compliant in every jurisdiction they operate in. This already gives them a near Herculean advantage compared to blockchain players when it comes to the realm of CBDCs. And they are actively capitalizing on it.    They are already innovating around CBDCs    Most major payment players are actively innovating for the CBDC and digital currency space. For example, Mastercard recently launched a proprietary virtual testing environment for evaluating CBDCs, which has already aided a number of banks in their evaluation and exploration of national digital currencies.      The new platform will enable banks, financial service providers and consumers to simulate the issuance, delivery and exchange of CBDCs. Central banks, commercial banks, technology and consulting firms have been invited to assess CBDC tech designs, validate use cases and assess interoperability with existing payment rails. Although there are a number of possible operational models, the most common one involves central banks issuing and distributing digital currencies, through commercial banks and other approved payment providers.    CBDC interoperability ... requires tackling both complex engineering and complex regulations.    Additionally, users of a multi-currency Mastercard debit card will be able to purchase, carry, swap and sell up to eighteen conventional and digital currencies, as well as make free international ATM withdrawals up to a certain number.      Visa has already built and launched its solution to settle USDC transactions on Visa cards on the Ethereum blockchain. Its pilot allowed Crypto.com to settle a portion of its obligations for the Crypto.com Visa card program in USDC. This was enabled by Anchorage, the first federally chartered digital asset bank and an exclusive Visa digital currency settlement partner. These exact capabilities and their treasury improvements and integration with Anchorage will help with CBDC processing in the future.

Its cryptocurrency offering last year enabled customers to convert their cryptocurrency holdings into fiat currency at checkouts. If a user has ""sufficient cryptocurrency balance to support a qualified transaction,"" the crypto-payment function would automatically appear in their PayPal wallet. Although PayPal has not made public its CBDC strategy as yet, it is actively working on the space with an in-house team.      As CBDCs emerge as a major disruptor to existing infrastructure, interoperability remains one of the most significant roadblocks to their functionality. Although most financial institutions remained wary of digital currencies, payment players like Visa, Mastercard and PayPal have not only accepted the concept of cryptocurrencies and CBDCs but are constantly innovating on both fronts.

42434163,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8adh,1617980910,XRP's Price Can Go ‘Boatload’ Higher: Veteran Analyst Peter Brandt,"A rally in the XRP (XRP) token rally may have just started, and new all-time highs could be seen for the cryptocurrency in the coming months, says Peter Brandt, an analyst with over four decades of experience tracking commodity markets.      Brandt identified a pattern in XRP’s weekly price chart that he described as a “possible inverted head-and-shoulders with a stunted right shoulder.” XRP has quadrupled this year in price and recently climbed above $1 for the first time since 2018, for a $37 billion market capitalization.      The pattern “would indicate prices a boatload higher"" to new all-time highs, Brandt, CEO of Factor LLC, tweeted Friday.      Inverted head-and-shoulders patterns comprise three price troughs, with the middle one being the lowest, and a trendline connecting the high points of the two retracements. A breakout or bullish reversal is confirmed once an asset establishes a firm foothold above the neckline hurdle.      While XRP has already flipped the neckline hurdle of 75 cents into support, a weekly close above (Sunday, 23:59 UTC) is still needed to confirm the breakout.      That would open the doors for a rally to $3.30, the all-time high hit on Jan. 4, 2018, according to data source Messari.      Technical analysis is subjective because there is an art to the science involved in identifying patterns. Hence, sometimes analysts differ on the validity of patterns or interpret similar-looking price structures differently.      According to Katie Stockton, a technical analyst at Fairlead Strategies, the price structure seen on the weekly chart is not a textbook inverted head-and-shoulders formation.      ""It does not meet my qualifier of having just three major oversold lows throughout the formation of the pattern,"" Stockton said in an email. ""There is such a thing as a complex head-and-shoulders, but I think more accurately this can be labeled as a rounded base.""      For an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern to be valid per Stockton, the three troughs need to be accompanied by an oversold reading on an overbought/oversold indicator such as the relative strength index (RSI).      Brandt and Katie differ on semantics but agree on the interpretation. ""The takeaway is similarly bullish given the breakout above long-term resistance,"" Stockton said, adding that XRP has already achieved the upside price targets.      XRP is currently trading at $1.003, representing a 58% gain for the week – the most since the final week of January, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Also read: XRP Rises Above $1 for First Time Since March 2018, Despite SEC Shadow      The coin is enjoying the madness of the crowd, Brandt noted. The rally may have received a boost from New York Judge Sarah Netburn's recent decision to grant Ripple access to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) internal communications on how it determines whether a cryptocurrency is security.      In December, the SEC sued Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen for unlawful selling of $1.3 billion worth of XRP to the general public.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/09/xrps-price-can-go-boatload-higher-veteran-analyst-peter-brandt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b1a174454611120b1f072ee72ac91cd6934274f-1000x881.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434154,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8aRh,1617973554,How a 'Dual Double-Entry' Blockchain Could Unite Digital and Physical Assets,"Zenotta, which includes both the Zenotta data protocol and the Zenotta network protocol, has raised $10.7 million in its seed round to pursue solving what it calls the “data problem.”      The data problem, according to Zenotta, is simultaneously simple and complex.      Data contains two main qualities: the ability to contain information and value. That value can be derived contractually, economically, socially or legally.      Think about the ways that, for example, a land deed is essentially a collection of data that holds value because of the asset with which it’s associated. Alternatively, think of the ways that your personal data, when aggregated with millions of other people, drives value for social media companies who use it to attract advertising revenue.      “While machines can operate on information through logic and maths, they cannot preserve or describe value. This is the 'data problem,'” said Andrew Kessler, CTO and co-founder of Zenotta.      “Zenotta converts any form of data or digital content into Smart Data – a rival and excludable digital asset that is truly unique and can be owned. This ownership gives the Smart Data value, and gives the owner the rights and control over their Smart Data asset, something that was previously unattainable.”      Zenotta has been in development since 2015 and mined its genesis block in early March 2021. There is another funding round planned for the coming months, in advance of its forthcoming initial coin offering.      The idea is to make real-world assets, not just digital currencies, tradable via blockchain.    Zenotta’s dual double-entry blockchain    The Zenotta Digital System is made up of the Zenotta Data Protocol (which converts any type of data into Smart Data) and the Zenotta Network Protocol (the Proof-of-Work, dual double-entry blockchain on which transactions are executed).      A dual double-entry blockchain is an accounting system Zenotta has built where the seller pledges to the network a real asset (a file secured by the Zenotta data protocol) and the buyer pledges some native tokens.      This is to correct what the project says are some of the failings of single-entry blockchain ledgers. Kessler points to the shortcomings of non-fungible tokens – for example, ""rugpull scams in which people have changed the JPEG associated with an NFT even after purchase. All the NFT does is point to a file somewhere on the internet, which can be changed or even deleted. This is because single-entry blockchain ledgers distribute tokens over their network, not the assets themselves.    Read more: Data Is Labor: Why We Need Data Unions    “Asset distribution happens off-chain in the ‘real world/internet,’ far beyond the reach of token-based blockchains,” said Kessler. “This allows for crypto payment to be triggered without concomitant asset distribution.”      In Zenotta’s dual double-entry blockchain ledger, if the network protocol can authenticate both halves of the trade the transaction is packaged into a block where the data asset and the tokens used to pay for the asset are exchanged between two wallets simultaneously. Kessler said if any error were to occur, the trade would roll back to the seller, who then holds onto their provably scarce file, while the buyer holds onto their token amount.      “The benefits of the dual double-entry are both for the seller and for the buyer. In traditional single-entry ledgers, the ledger favors the seller,” he said. “Furthermore, the folding of sell requests and buy requests into dual double-entries allows for programmable service levels and governance without control and pricing, the cornerstone of any capital market.”    Smart Data vs. the 'data problem'    When thinking of most tech, analogies help. For example, according to Kessler, there is a big gap between using fingerprint evidence in a court case versus blood DNA evidence. While someone's fingerprint may be publicly accessible, their blood is not.      “Current attempts to use hashes (file fingerprints) to link off-chain files to on-chain hashes (or any fingerprinting technology) have several technical difficulties making them undesirable,” said Kessler. “Smart data uses the idea that a file’s binary DNA both builds the file content and also identifies the file uniquely.”      This creates a stronger relationship between what’s recorded on the ledger and what’s happening in the real world, potentially allowing a synchronized off-chain world governed by on-chain parameters.      Kessler also said there are other benefits that accrue with Smart Data.    Read more: Lessons From the Nifty Gateway NFT Heist: Not Your Keys, Not Your Art    One is privacy. Existing hashes can be reverse-searched given enough computing power, meaning with enough time you could find what file exists beyond the ledger.      “Our file DNA approach guarantees that it is impossible to learn anything about the off-chain file’s DNA by studying the on-chain entry,” Kessler said. “But when the file is willingly handed over by the owner for inspection, it can be proven 100% to be the owner’s digital property and the correct file referenced by the ledger.”      A second benefit is that Smart Data signatures are modular. In standard, hash-based, data-signature schemes, the validator learns the signer’s identity, the file’s integrity and the file content (message) all at the same time – otherwise none of the above can be verified.      “The modular nature of the Smart Data signing scheme allows a recipient to establish the owner’s identity independently of the file’s content or integrity"" if the owner wishes their identity to become known, said Kessler.      Same for independently establishing integrity and accessing file content.      Finally, Smart Data is for files, not just smart contracts, which Kessler refers to as applications. Bad data can track a smart contract. Kessler said the lack of a data oracle means automated smart contract deployment is hindered.      “But if the Smart Data is smart, even ‘dumb’ applications can act intelligently,” he said. “For enterprise, this is a big deal. Integrating Smart Data is as simple as setting the storage format. Enterprise’s application layer needs no upgrading or amendments.”      A statement announcing the funding round said Zenotta would continue to scale up its operations focusing on the further development and testing of its technology while also connecting with its burgeoning mining community. It will also finalize its advisory board and strategic partnerships.      Zenotta’s native token is the “zeno,” which will be used to purchase Smart Data and provide the ""gas"" for Smart Data contracts.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | TOKEN SALE,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/09/how-a-dual-double-entry-blockchain-could-unite-digital-and-physical-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42ed0303bbcdd8a0f06f27b92b0de2069d616f41-2560x2012.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434156,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8aPh,1617973233,CipherTrace Wants to Introduce DEXs to Sanctions Compliance,"Crypto analytics firm CipherTrace is adding to its list of regulatory compliance tools with a new sanctions-friendly address tracker for decentralized exchanges (DEXs).      Announced Friday, the new DeFi Compli tool creates an oracle on Chainlink that details crypto wallet addresses on government watchlist, such as the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list. DEXs or other decentralized smart contracts could tap these lists and prevent transactions from touching sanctioned addresses.      “What we’ve seen in the U.S. at least is really a focus on sanctions,” said John Jefferies, chief financial analyst and marketing officer for CipherTrace. “That’s the angle regulators are most concerned about right now and one of the things that has crept into the latest [Financial Action Task Force draft guidance] was proliferation financing.”      A handful of cryptocurrency addresses are already on OFAC's sanctions list, allegedly tied to cybercriminals, theft, drug smugglers and election interference.    Read more: US Treasury Sanctions Russians Using Crypto for Election Interference    A press release announcing the new tool claimed implementing some form of crypto crime monitoring in decentralized finance (DeFi) is timely. The increasing amount of value locked in DeFi – currently some $51.4 billion, according to DeFi Pulse – presents an ""even bigger target"" for malicious actors, CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans said in a statement.      More specifically, decentralized products that facilitate traditional financial activities like lending still fall within existing regulations, CipherTrace said, pointing to a 2020 speech by Securities and Exchange Commission digital asset head Valerie Szczepanik.      The regulatory crypto czar warned at the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s 2020 Parallel Summit that securities, banking, lending and anti-money laundering (AML) laws all apply to these financial activities.    Regulating DeFi    The latest in a set of know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) products launched by CipherTrace, the new DeFi Compli is fairly simple: CipherTrace runs its own Chainlink node, and has set up an oracle it can update that contains a list of sanctioned addresses or funds.      Developers of DEXs or other DeFi smart contracts can set up an API call to the oracle, creating a function on their platforms that would prevent sanctioned addresses from sending funds through the DEX or contract, and similarly prevent users from sending funds to the sanctioned addresses.      “Right now we’re really looking at screening the addresses, not the individuals, so from their perspective they would on-ramp onto the DEX from their wallet, maybe from their MetaMask, [and] the DEX itself would ping the compliance oracle and say ‘is this an OFAC-sanctioned address,’” Jefferies said. “From the user perspective, unless it is an OFAC-sanctioned address, it would be transparent and frictionless.”    Read more: CipherTrace Releases Its FATF-Friendly AML Tools for Crypto Exchanges    Jefferies said he hopes to expand the service as it evolves. While it’s only looking at specifically sanctioned sources at the moment, a future iteration could evaluate whether the source of funds is otherwise linked to illicit activity.      In his view, the crypto sector, including decentralized platforms that aspire to be stateless, must comply with regulations voluntarily or risk being shut down forcefully.      DEXs are virtual asset service providers, Jefferies said, referring to the term the Financial Action Task Force uses in its guidance around crypto exchange regulation. If the crypto sector can prove that DEXs can still comply with existing regulations, entities like FATF may focus less on carving out specific rules for developers or projects.      “Like it or not, the whole decentralized community needs to address this. Otherwise the [regulations are] going to come down in full force and the ripple effect might hit the rest of the decentralized world,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LINK | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/09/ciphertrace-wants-to-introduce-dexs-to-sanctions-compliance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d699767b56110cd9404edea2775e9b4845aaf0db-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There is strong resistance around $60,000, which has been tested multiple times since March.    The oversold reading on the four-hour relative strength index (RSI) on April 7 preceded a near 5% rise in BTC. The last oversold reading on March 25 preceded a near 19% price rally.  BTC is attempting to break above a series of lower price highs since April 1, which suggests buyers are gaining strength as sellers retreat.  Intraday support is around $56,934. The four-hour RSI is not yet overbought, which indicates further upside over the short term.  However, BTC’s uptrend on daily and weekly charts is slowing.

42434161,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8abh,1617966000,"No 'Stimmy' Rally: Why the $1,400 Checks Brought So Little Bitcoin Stimulus","U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges say they've begun to see an uptick in customers buying bitcoin (BTC) or other digital tokens with their $1,400 stimulus checks from President Joe Biden's latest coronavirus-relief and economic recovery plan.      But in the bitcoin market, the episode has proven to be a disappointment to some traders who were speculating last month that a new wave of demand might help push prices to fresh highs.      “It would be very difficult to get a full picture of how that money moved from Uncle Sam into bitcoin,"" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, a market analysis firm based in Tel Aviv, during an interview with CoinDesk.      Biden signed the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill into law on March 11, and the $1,400 stimulus payments started going out soon afterward, many of them via direct deposit into recipients' bank accounts.      Soon afterward, some cryptocurrency traders began to speculate whether some of that money might be used to buy bitcoin. Mizuho Securities, a Japanese brokerage firm, estimated that $40 billion of stimulus checks could be spent on bitcoin and stocks, according to a survey published on March 15.      As recently as late last month, no cryptocurrency exchanges reported any major bump in $1,400 purchases, based on an informal survey by CoinDesk. Industry executives cautioned that it might be too early to judge.      Now, those purchases do appear to be happening, according to some firms, even if they're not the tsunami that some bitcoin bulls might have expected.      “We have seen a significant number of deposits in the amount of the latest individual stimulus check,” Steve Ehrlich, CEO of U.S. cryptocurrency brokerage Voyager Digital, told CoinDesk in an email sent by a spokesperson.      Kraken, a San Francisco-based exchange, has seen an “uptick that may well stem from U.S. stimulus checks,” according to Thomas Perfumo, the company’s head of business operations and strategy.      But the rise in $1,400 “stimmy” deposits hasn't been enough to bid up bitcoin.      Over the past month, BTC has struggled to decisively break above $60,000 amid slugglish trading activity. Slowing volume is typical of a consolidation phase in price action, diverging from the BTC price uptrend seen earlier in the year.      Traders could be waiting to accumulate BTC at lower support levels, especially given the near two-fold price increase this year.      “We expect weak BTC support around $56,000 down to $52,000, and stronger BTC support starting at $44,000 down to $42,000,"" wrote Justin Chuh, senior trader at Wave Financial, a digital asset investment fund. ""BTC resistance remains at $60,000.”      Retail traders aren’t the only ones on standby; institutional demand is also slowing. ""The drop-off in volume has been more related to institutional volume going down, especially with the decline in futures market volatility,"" said Hunter Merghart, head of U.S. operations at Bitstamp, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Luxembourg.      ""We're seeing new institutions coming on board from traditional finance backgrounds, ramping up deposits on the platform,"" Merghart said. ""These are buy-and-hold clients, unlike prop shops in 2017.""      Retail accounts make up about 80% of deposits on Bitstamp. The company experienced growth in retail deposits under $2,000 over the past month when U.S. stimulus checks were issued, Merghart told CoinDesk during a phone interview.      Robinhood, an online brokerage app, said Thursday that 9.5 million customers traded cryptocurrencies during the first three months of the year, up from 1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.      There just wasn't much of a bitcoin stimulus.      ""I wasn’t expecting stimmies to pump bitcoin,"" said Greenspan, of Quantum Economics.

42434166,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8ajh,1617965466,Bitcoin Miners Are Again Stacking Coins in a Positive Sign for the Market,"Blockchain data shows bitcoin miners are accumulating coins and adding to bullish pressures in the market for the first time since December.      Analytics firm Glassnode's miner position change metric, which gauges the 30-day change in the supply held in the miners' addresses, recently turned positive in a sign of renewed holding by those responsible for making coins.      The balance held in miner wallets has increased by 4,435 BTC to 1.806 million over the past two weeks, Glassnode's data shows.      ""Miners [now] have a net accumulation of liquid assets as they have enough cash in reserve to run their future operations, having liquidated holdings when the bitcoin price was between $20,000 and $40,000, or most of them are holding in anticipation of a price rally,"" Flex Yang, CEO of Hong Kong-based Babel Finance, said in an email.      Miners predominantly operate on cash and liquidate holdings to meet expenses. However, the pace of miner selling varies from time to time depending on mining-specific factors and bitcoin's price expectations.      The return to accumulation mode observed since March 31 comes after almost four months of largely negative readings – miners decreasing positions and taking profits. Peak distribution of roughly 17,000 BTC to 24,000 BTC was seen throughout January, according to Glassnode's weekly newsletter, dated March 8.      While miner flows constitute a small part of the total network volume, as tweeted by Glassnode's CEO Rafael Schultze-Kraft, accumulation by miners is analogous to increased promoter holding of corporate stock and is considered a positive indicator. ""Their spending patterns provide insight into the sentiment of some of the biggest bulls in the Bitcoin market,"" Glassnode said in a newsletter published on April 5.      Whales, or large investors with the ability to influence prices, have also stopped selling coins.      The number of whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 bitcoin – has steadied above 2,000 since March 31.      The figure dropped from 2,230 to 2,004 in nearly two months to March 31, mainly due to quarter-end rebalancing, according to blockchain analyst Willy Woo. It remains to be seen if these positive on-chain developments fuel the next leg higher in the cryptocurrency.      While bitcoin is currently trading moderately higher on the day near $58,500, it remains trapped in a narrowing price range. A breakout would mark a continuation of the broader uptrend typically experienced in the seasonally strong month of April.

42434155,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8aNh,1617961495,Ukrainian Officials Backtrack on Crypto Wealth Claims as Feds Promise Probe: Report,"Ukrainian public officials who reported eye-popping numbers of bitcoin in their property declarations might be having some regrets after the nation's anti-corruption agency said it would weigh in.      As CoinDesk reported earlier this week, 652 public officials in Ukraine reported owning 46,351 bitcoin (BTC), worth around US$2.67 billion at the recent price, in their obligatory property declaration. The numbers raised eyebrows, especially when it came to individual declarations.      For example, Vyacheslav Mishalov, a member of the Dnipro city council, reported owning 18,000 bitcoin; Petro Lensky, first secretary of Ukraine’s embassy in Vietnam, said he had 6,528 BTC; and Alexander Urbansky, deputy chairman of the Odessa regional council, reported holding 5,328 BTC.      It turned out, however, those numbers should be taken with a pinch of salt. On Friday, Mishalov said he made a mistake and ""skipped the line"" with crypto in his declaration and actually he doesn't have that much BTC.      That admission came right after Ukraine's anti-corruption authorities took notice of the whopping numbers declared by public officials. Following the report by the data analytics project Opendatabot on Thursday, the head of the office of mandatory full inspections at the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption (NAPC) said on his Facebook page that the agency will look into the reported holdings.      ""When checking the declaration, we will see whether the declarant really owns the specified number of crypto tokens, whether the money for its purchase was really transferred and whether the declarant can explain the origin of the money spent on the purchase of tokens,"" NAPC's Sergiy Petukhov wrote. He added that filing a false declaration might lead to a criminal investigation.      The next day, Mishalov told a Ukrainian TV channel he actually doesn't own that much bitcoin, although he does have some.      ""I do have some bitcoin, quite a lot actually, but of course not that much,"" Mishalov said. ""I was amending my previous declaration and didn't update that line. I wrote a letter to NAPC and you will soon see the updated declaration.""      Another self-declared crypto whale, Alexander Urbansky, told the journalists he bought bitcoin in 2009 at the price of $1.      Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister for digital transformation of Ukraine, said public officials in Ukraine might be claiming to own large amounts of cryptocurrencies as a plausible explanation of ill-gotten income.      Michael Chobanyan, founder of the Ukrainian crypto exchange Kuna, told CoinDesk crypto is often used to explain why a civil servant happens to own a lot of money he or she couldn't have possibly gained in a legal manner.      ""Previously, they would declare royalties from books. Now they might simply say they sold some crypto and here's how they could buy that villa in Italy,"" Chobanyan said. He added that, in practice, nobody would check such claims so they often might be outright false.      He believes 99,9% of the crypto Ukrainian public officials declared this year are bogus numbers.

42434146,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8a9h,1617936436,Rare CryptoPunk NFTs Will be Auctioned by Christie's Next Month,"Nine rare non-fungible token (NFT) digital collectibles known as CryptoPunks will be sold by the physical auction house Christie's, according to a Twitter announcement on Thursday.    The digital collectibles are from marketplace Larva Labs's own collection, and are set to feature in the 255-year-old auction house's ""21st Century Evening Sale"" next month in New York city.  All nine CryptoPunks are from mints below 1,000, meaning they were created in the earliest days of the company's digital collectibles.  The mint numbers include 2, 532, 58, 30, 635, 602, 768, 603 and 757, with a ""rare alien"" collectible to be included in the auction also.  The announcement signals that NFTs continue to be legitimized by establishment art firms, even as athletes and musicians also ramp up their participation in the NFT space.  Rival auction house Sotheby's, which was founded 22 years before Christie's, will also sell NFT art later this month.  NFTs are digital cryptocurrency tokens that can take on various attributes to represent artwork or assets online, as can be seen in CryptoPunks such as Mohawk Thin and Frumpy Hair.  Christie's sold an NFT representing digital artist Beeple's work for $69 million last month, setting a record for the NFT space. The auction house accepted ether for the sale.  In February, a batch of 34 NFTs was purchased by a whale who paid 557.5 ETH (roughly $1 million) in minutes highlighting the popularity of the pixelated collectibles.  Twitter user DeGenData claimed ""Punk Sellers are racing to pull their punks off the market"" after the announcement by Christie's because offers for the Punks are ""getting hit like crazy.""  The ""price floor has moved to around 5 ETH … already,"" tweeted DeGenData.
