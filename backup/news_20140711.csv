42425885,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgldh,1405119913,CoinDesk Mining Roundup: BitFury's Latest Venture and a Global Scrypt Network,"The bitcoin mining ecosystem seems primed for major change, if recent developments are harbingers of what’s to come. New funding and expansive initiatives are pushing the boundaries of the mining sector and opening doors for both recent entrants and established heavyweights.  Today the bitcoin network hash rate stands at nearly 125 petahashes per second, according to Blockchain, with the difficulty resting just below 17 billion. With a steady trend upward – and suggestions that mining economies around the world could grow in scope and capacity – there’s no telling where these numbers will be by summer’s end.  With that, read on to see what’s been happening in the mining world during the past two weeks.  PeerNova raises funds in pre-Series A round  PeerNova, the company formed by the May merger of CloudHashing and HighBitcoin, has announced new pre-Series A funding from a single investor.  Cybersecurity entrepreneur and FireEye founder Ashar Aziz is investing an undisclosed sum in the California-based company. FireEye, founded in 2004, specializes in network security services and has a market capitalization of nearly $5bn.  Aziz remarked in a press statement that becoming involved with bitcoin is part of a broader shift to a safer, cryptographically enhanced digital economy, saying:  “As cyber threats proliferate and get more sophisticated, I believe that crypto-ledgers like bitcoin’s block chain will play an increasing role in recording the exchange of valuable assets.”  The funding will be used to fund PeerNova’s future projects, which includes next-generation mining hardware and peer-to-peer application platforms. CEO Naveed Sherwani said that the company plans on releasing a range of products that take advantage of the possible uses for the block chain, calling the block chain “the true innovation” of bitcoin.  Since its formation two months ago, PeerNova has emerged on the global bitcoin stage as a leading voice. Sherwani took part in a broad discussion on the nature and future of mining at the CoinSummit digital currency confab in London that also included MegaBigPower CEO Dave Carlson.  BitFury enters the investment game  Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer BitFury has announced the creation of BitFury Capital, a new seed investment initiative that will fund nascent companies in the bitcoin space.  BitFury, which raised $20 million in new funding in May, wants to forge a series of new partnerships with bitcoin companies over the next few years. The company is actively seeking partners and fund participants, with those interested being invited to apply, according to a 9th July press release.  In a statement, BitFury chief executive Valery Vavilov said that the company wants to use its weight to provide support to other parts of the bitcoin market. Proceeds from the new fund will both help BitFury grow its own initiatives while expanding investments elsewhere.  He said:  “Our leadership position in cryptocurrency and bitcoin infrastructure will help accelerate and help grow the significance of other parts in the ecosystem – which in return grows the value of our own core business, and enables us to expand into new opportunities within the industry.”  The company’s significant role in the mining space suggests that it may become involved with existing businesses as well as new ones. BitFury’s products can be found in a range of operations worldwide, including North America-based industrial miner MegaBigPower. As well, BitFury received a high-profile customer in CoinSeed, which purchased $5 million in hardware at the time.  Zeus seeks ‘global scrypt network’  Last month, MegaBigPower announced the launch of a global mining franchisee program aimed at significantly expanding hashing power within the bitcoin network.  Mining hardware company Zeus Integrated Systems, which operates mining ASIC ZeusMiner and cloud hashing service ZeusHost, is aiming to launch a similar project that it calls a “Global Scrypt Mining Network”.  Specifically, the company said that it will provide mining power and the expertise to operate it to those who have facility space and sufficient power output to run the machines. In a press release, Zeus remarked that the goal was to empower miners and build more sustainable networks for altcoins that utilize the hashing algorithm.  The company said:  “Despite the ups and down in altcoin market, we hold strong faith in scrypt mining industry. Scrypt-based coins have already taken a large share in crypocurrency business. We believe altcoins led by litecoin will rise as a vital force for earning more ROI.”  In its announcement, Zeus added that interested parties should submit information regarding the resources they are capable of providing, including available space, power output and expertise in the area of scrypt mining. Those interested can contact the company by sending an email to farm@zeusminer.com.  ASIC Highlight: the RockMiner Rocket Box  CoinDesk received a Rocket Box from RockMiner to test out. The bitcoin ASIC is advertised as providing approximately 450-490 GH/s in performance, with a roughly 480 watt power consumption rating. We took the seven-kilogram unit for a spin to see how it performed mining bitcoins.  Set-up was simple, requiring about 10 minutes of wiring. The Rocket Box came with the requisite USB cables, receiver port for the cables and a Raspberry Pi.  For power access, the unit requires four six-pin PCI-E cables which were not provided but are easily attainable at any computer hardware stores.  RockMiner deploys a cloud-based user interface with a native CGMiner environment.  As you can see in the picture below, the UI offers basic information including mining performance per ASIC, temperature rates and share accrual, as well as share time updates and rejection rates for each unit.  You can also input pool information, configure IP address data and update existing information. The UI also facilitates unit rebooting and status checks.  Hashing power-wise, the unit performs well within the ranges advertised by the company. According to our comparisons between pool and RockMiner UI readings, the unit averaged between 460 GH/s and 515 GH/s at a given time.  In terms of operating temperatures, the Rocket Box ASICs averaged 51 degrees Celcius and maintained that range over a 12-hour testing period. It’s design is conducive for air cooling, and with the added fan the Rocket Box doesn’t get too hot.  The unit’s power consumption rate was also close to the advertised numbers. The unit pulled approximately 490 watts on an 860-watt power source, and maintained a steady flow through a 12-hour test. The unit’s ability to hash upon power-up was noted to be quick – after preprogramming, the Rocket Box automatically connects to a predetermined pool after startup.  Overall, the Rocket Box delivers hashing power and electrical consumption rates as-advertised. Aesthetically its design is a good fit for any sized (in our case, very small) mining space and the open-air concept allows for easy access to the components.

42425876,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglLh,1405113308,French Government Outlines New Regulations for Bitcoin Market Transparency,"The French Ministry for the Economy and Finance has outlined regulatory measures to be put in place by the year’s end for financial institutions and users of bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The 11th July communiqué, which came from the office of Budget and Public Accounts Minister Michel Sapin, emerged in response to a report by Tracfin, a unit that targets money laundering and illicit finance operations.  Sapin said in a statement:  “This report shows that even if the existing volumes of virtual currencies are not likely to destabilize the financial system, these unofficial currencies are developing and have risks of illegal or fraudulent use.”  He presented four regulatory actions with the aim of “securing” users of “these currencies that offer particular opportunities for transactions lower than traditional payment services costs"".  Transparency cited by regulators  The new regulations require bitcoin “distributors” to identify and verify their users to limit the level of anonymity. As well, regulators will have to clarify the treatment of bitcoin and other digital currencies in France’s tax system. The digital currency will also become subject to capital gains taxes.  The document read:  “We have proposed […] a threshold on the margin tax of €5,000. We believe that France should let people try, invest and develop business with bitcoin before we tax it.”  Ultimately, the regulations are presented as a means to promote greater transparency in France's bitcoin market. Due to the pseudonymous means of bitcoin, the document also calls on regulators to discuss and present a spending cap for digital currency transactions, in keeping with the current rules for cash payments.  Finally, at the European level, the French government is now increasing regulation of bitcoin exchanges that handle fiat currencies. Specifically, exchanges are required to report on every transaction and verify the identity of the parties involved in any bitcoin activity.  France's stance on bitcoin evolving  Speaking for the Association Bitcoin France, President Philippe Rodriguez told CoinDesk that it disagrees with the key points of the new guidance. However, he acknowledged the positive aspects of the new regulation, saying:  “Yes, this is going in the right direction. Although we disagree on the verification on 'every transaction' of identity, we understand the principles.”  France’s bitcoin community has evolved as discourse - and action - on the federal level continues to take shape. La Maison du Bitcoin opened in May, bringing Europe its first bitcoin center. It offers flexible co-working space, assistance for bitcoin startup companies, workshops, hackathons, meetups and a Lamassu bitcoin ATM.  Imposing taxes on bitcoin is a controversial issue in the country - as well as throughout the world - because of the uncertain legal definition of the digital currency. Earlier this year, the French government said that although it does not officially recognize bitcoin as a currency, it can still impose income taxes.  It was the second acknowledgment from the government since the central bank issued warnings in December against price volatility.

42425883,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglXh,1405108535,CoinSummit Day Two: Mining Superpowers and the 51% Challenge,"A significantly thinned out crowd reassembled for the second day of CoinSummit in London today.  Those who didn't attend the Swam-sponsored afterparty the previous night - or possessed exceptional powers of post-party rejuvenation - dutifully filed into the glass-walled East Wintergarden. Several panelists informed CoinDesk, and in some cases posted on Twitter, that many libations were consumed the previous night.  Ultimately, the crowd came geared up for what promised to be another data-packed series of panel discussions.  On 51% attacks, core devs call for miner activism  Day two kicked off with a panel discussion focused on a hot topic in the bitcoin community: the threat of 51% attacks.  Titled 'Will Bitcoin Last the Distance Beyond the 51% Challenge?', the panel was moderated by angel investor Jez San and featured of bitcoin core developers Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd, as well as Cornell University Professor Emin Gun Sirer.  The participants agreed that, while there will be a technical fix at some point in the future that prevents 51% attacks, for the time being, the onus is on the mining community to make sure that such an event is avoided at all costs.  Todd said the mining community needs to be responsible and considerate of which pools they use in order to ensure that mining power is spread evenly across the network. He added that pool-switching should be explored by large-scale miners, if necessary.  He went on to say there need to be more developers involved with bitcoin core projects. Currently, Garzik explained, people are pitching plenty of great concepts but there isn't enough hands-on involvement – or hours in the day – to research, develop and implement these ideas.  The conversation later turned to education and the development of a new generation of core developers. Sirer said masters classes at Cornell university now feature a lecture or two on cryptocurrencies. He doesn't see a full course on the topic being created anytime soon, but he said that a number of students are choosing to focus their research projects on bitcoin.  A key takeaway from the panel: awareness of bitcoin in the 18-to-22-year-old crowd is ever increasing. As a result, the space should see an influx of crypto-focused graduates in the coming years ahead.  China could become a mining superpower  China is always a heated topic for bitcoin price-watchers. Several major price movements in the past year have been largely attributed to regulatory changes from the Chinese government.  A panel focusing on China's bitcoin market included Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTC China, Rui Ma of startup seed fund 500 Startups and Jack Wang of bitcoin wallet Bifubao. The panel was moderated by Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Venture Partners.  The panel had several interesting pieces of information to share. Ma discussed how China already has three well-funded bitcoin exchanges, and as a result, that part of the ecosystem has become unattractive to new entrepreneurs. Instead, exchange-focused startups are diverting their efforts to altcoin exchanges, wallets and services.  Ma also noted that the mining sector is the focus of much investment and entrepreneurial activity. She cited funding rounds for mining operations that have brought tens of millions of dollars in investment thus far.  Ma said:  ""It appears there is a staggering amount of money being poured in [...] I was under the impression that China had cheaper electricity but that's not the case; it's because of cheaper labour and real estate costs.""  Underlining the importance of mining in China, Wang remarked that some estimates suggested China-based miners could account for up to 60% of global mining power in future. Both he and and Bobby Lee struck less optimistic tones in regards to the Chinese bitcoin market.  Lee pointed out that the Chinese government had issued informal guidance to banks and payment processors that were ""suffocating"" exchanges, although official guidance remained relatively liberal towards bitcoin. This approach appeared to be gaining traction with other regulators around the world. This included Europe, as demonstrated by a recent report from the European Banking Authority.  Lee continued:  ""[The authorities] say one thing, and they do something different by suffocating exchanges, limiting what banks and payment providers can do. This is true in Hong Kong and Singapore as well. When the doors are closed, they say, don't you dare touch it, don't you dare transact with bitcoin companies. It's all hush-hush, never written down.""  Lee added that the notion that Hong Kong, a special administrative region within China, was being treated as a more liberal jurisdiction for bitcoin by the Chinese government is false.  ""There is a feeling that China is going to allow Hong Kong to experiment with bitcoin. I don't think there's any truth to that. All the banks I talk to in Hong Kong are even more paranoid,"" he said.  Wang, meanwhile, said there was a serious adoption problem among merchants in China. This is because of the impression that bitcoin is illegal. As a result, entrepreneurs can't build a company that provides consumer-friendly end-to-end services in the mode of Coinbase or BitPay due to a lack of demand.  Wang explained:  ""It was tough convincing [merchants] to take that risk, especially combined with the capacity of Chinese consumers not to spend their bitcoin. That cuts off the merchant services portion.""  Banks still wary of bitcoin companies  A group of exchange operators gave their views on the challenges facing their corner of the bitcoin economy.  The panel included Rich Teo, the outgoing CEO of Singapore and New York-based exchange ItBit; Jesse Powell of Kraken, the largest exchange by volume for the euro-bitcoin trading pair, according to CoinSummit organiser Pamir Gelenbe; and Jeffrey Smith of CEX.io, the exchange arm of mining pool Ghash.io. Luke Sully of PwC's fraud unit moderated.  The discussion focused primarily on transparency and compliance. Powell noted that his firm spends heavily on legal work to ensure legal compliance in US, even though the nature of future regulations regarding digital currency remains vague. This, he said, puts the company at a disadvantage compared to other exchanges that operate in the US without the same outlay on legal affairs. Powell also remarked that he sees more liquidity entering the bitcoin market from a variety of institutional sources, saying:  ""The single biggest challenge for any exchange is liquidity, and liquidity begets more liquidity. I see more liquidity coming in through institutional money, through Wall Street, hedge funds, prop trading shops, family offices.""  Banks also continue to be the bane of exchange's operations, the panel agreed. The operators concurred that the process of gaining a banking relationship remains difficult and opaque. Powell summed it up:  ""You could spend a hundred hours with a bank and get the completely on board. Then for whatever reason, they pull out at the last minute. They decide it's too risky for them [...] They're more worried about what other banks think. Banks rely on other banks; it's a network. And that's something we can't really do anything about.""  Operators were unanimous on the topic of consolidation in their sector. But it won't happen any time soon, they said.  Should we call it mining?  A panel on the future of bitcoin mining brought together Marc Aafjes, who runs strategy and communications for BitFury; Dave Carlson, MegaBigPower's founder; Timo Hanke, chief technology officer at CoinTerra and Naveed Sherwani, chief executive of PeerNova. It was moderated by Jez San.  The issue of semantics - and whether or not the term 'mining' is accurate - came up repeatedly during the discussion. Sherwani raised the point that describing the industry with that language wasn't an accurate, saying  ""Mining gives a very different kind of mental image of what we do. We are not mining, we are processing transactions and adding blocks to the blockchain.""  Scalability and the shape of future investment in the mining space was also touched upon. As miners have to invest significant capital in order to run a competitive mine capable of discovering blocks, the issue raised was this: how much capital outlay will be the right amount? Carlson thought he had the answer:  ""In the next two years 2.6 million bitcoins will be produced. At current prices that's a $2 billion market opportunity. How much does it cost to invest, to capture a large market share of that $2 billion? It’s far less than $2 billion. You could invest $100 million and capture a significant share.""  Petahash predictions  With the network running at roughly 140 petahashes per second, moderator Jez asked the mining panel how much hashing power they foresee by year's end. Here's what they had to say:  Timo Hanke: 600 PH/s.  Naveen Sherwani: 350-400 PH/s.  Dave Carlson: 350-400 PH/s.  Marc Aafjes: More than 600 PH/s.  And with those predictions posted, the curtains were brought down on another CoinSummit in London. Suitcases with wheels were produced and speakers and delegates prepared for the next cryptocurrency confab on their agenda.

42425882,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglPh,1405098197,Mystery Scavenger Hunt Gives Away Bitcoin in San Francisco,"Someone is going around San Francisco and leaving small sheets of aluminium all over the city. No, they are not littering. The sheets are in fact bitcoin 'paper' wallets – part of an elaborate scavenger hunt that is being carried out by an anonymous and fun-loving donor.  The hunt has its own twitter account, @SFHiddenBitcoin, which carries the slogan: 'Bringing bitcoins to the people by hiding them. An educational experiment'.  The account reveals clues as to where the wallets might be found, and acknowledges when they are found, but it is a mystery as to just who might be behind the stunt.    Clue #2: There's no printing press here, but they do accept Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/19PaldAA2T      — SF Hidden Bitcoin (@sfhiddenbitcoin) July 10, 2014    Cryptic crypto freebies  The wallets are neatly designed, black-on aluminium cards, displaying a bitcoin address, a QR code and the name of the twitter account. Each one is said to contain 0.0333 bitcoin, or about $20, which goes to the lucky finder.    Many of the twitter clues reference pop culture icons, movies and TV shows and are obviously designed to amuse. One is a play on words on the Facebook movie tagline: 'You don't pay $10m for a house without making a few enemies', and it is believed the card is hidden somewhere near Mark Zuckerbeg’s house.  Copycat scheme?  @SFHiddenBitcoin claims the scavenger hunt will go on for a month, with a new wallet stashed away in a new location every day of July. So far all the cards have been found within a short time of the clue being released.  The scheme closely resembles the Hidden Cash scavenger hunt organised by billionaire Jason Buzi in May. Buzi buried money in plastic toys in several locations in California and elsewhere, and the associated twitter feed eventually ended up with 700,000 followers.  @SFHiddenBitcoin currently has 219 followers, but media coverage is picking up, even at mainstream news outlets. Business Insider ran a brief feature on the scavenger hunt yesterday, while SF Weekly covered it today.

42425866,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgl1h,1405073343,"Italian Authorities Issue Bitcoin Warnings, Urge Regulation","Three Italian institutions have issued new bitcoin warnings in recent days, calling for new legislation to eliminate loopholes and regulatory ambiguity.  The warnings come just weeks after Italian lawmakers met with a group of bitcoin advocates in a fact-finding session. Soon after that, on 1st July, the successful ‘No Cash Day’ event also saw bitcoin representatives advocating for the digital currency in parliament.  Bitcoin regulation urged  Speaking in an interview with Ansa.it, Attorney General of Rome, Luigi Ciampoli, warned that bitcoin could be abused by criminals engaged in money laundering, financing of terrorism, or mafia activities. He urged for regulation that would allow authorities to trace and identify all persons involved in digital currency transactions.  However, Ciampoli also made some relatively positive comments about bitcoin, saying that the system “has its own charm” and has the potential to simplify transactions.  Ciampoli stressed that the current legislative framework is vague and that the problem should be addressed by new, specific legislation.  He argued that the bitcoin system “does not provide ample clarity” and that it is difficult to identify subjects involved in bitcoin transactions, meaning the currency has potential be misused for illicit purposes. Ciampoli pointed out that bitcoin’s public ledger does not guarantee that each user can be identified, as new owners are identified by a numerical code, which is not a real identity.  The court, he said, would like to see “precise and rigorous” rules to counter crimes involving digital currencies. Furthermore, bitcoin offers an “interesting new perspective, the legitimacy of which seems to solicit appropriate legislation to shelter operators from uncertainty and poor visibility”.  Money laundering a concern  In a recent report on the Italian financial information system (FIU), the Bank of Italy also warned that bitcoin poses a potential risk and that it can be employed to circumvent money laundering regulations or funnel funds to terrorist organisations.  The FIU is currently examining bitcoin’s potential for illicit activities and looking at complaints involving suspect bitcoin transactions. Like Ciampoli, the bank warns that “bitcoin transactions, while recorded in an online database, do not identify the parties involved in the transaction”.  Anonymity blamed  This sentiment is shared by Colonel Albert Reda of the Guardia di Finanza, Italy’s financial police authority, which is currently the only institution in Italy with the authority and resources to deal with bitcoin.  Reda told Italian daily La Repubblica that bitcoin’s volatility poses a risk for investors and that its anonymity allows Italian residents to hold and transfer wealth anonymously. Reda said the Guardia di Finanza is involved in an ongoing investigation, but he said he cannot disclose any information.  He said that the absence of any form of regulation makes bitcoin a “potentially powerful tool for money laundering, drug trafficking and arms trafficking.”  Furthermore, the Tor network can be employed to obscure online identities of persons involved in bitcoin transactions, while the bitcoin public ledger does not include information such as names, addresses or beneficiaries, as bitcoin addresses are “simply numeric codes”.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | WALLET,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/11/italian-authorities-issue-bitcoin-warnings-urge-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c2a7b809fca35bd3cf68698ec1fcad13a749bf4-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
