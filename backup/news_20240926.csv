34022572,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644702,1727389853,"Crypto Analyst Predicts What Will Drive The Ethereum Price Back Above $3,000 Again","Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has yet to reclaim the $3,000 price level since early August. Since the beginning of September, Ethereum has mostly traded below $2,600, but this week brought a glimmer of hope for investors as it finally managed to break above the $2,600 threshold. Now that this resistance threshold has been broken, the next outlook is a continued surge up until the $3,000 price level. An analysis on the CryptoQuant platform points to a potential catalyst for this move to the upside. Notably, this analysis identifies an emerging bullish trend in Ethereum’s funding rates as a critical catalyst. Bullish Shift In Funding Rates According to an ETH analysis on CryptoQuant by ShayanBTC, Ethereum’s 30-day moving average of funding rates has seen a slight but noticeable bullish shift after an extended period of decline. This change suggests that traders are once again becoming more confident in Ethereum’s price performance, particularly after the recent Fed interest rate cut. ETH Funding rates refer to the periodic payments made between traders to maintain the price of perpetual futures contracts near the spot price of the cryptocurrency. When the funding rates shift positively, it often indicates that long positions are more dominant, which can create upward price pressure. The importance of the funding rates was emphasized by the analyst, especially considering the prospect of a bullish fourth quarter of the year. Notably, they echoed that for Ethereum to continue its recovery and target higher price levels, the demand in the perpetual futures market must keep rising in the coming weeks. A small decline in the funding rates could cascade into a fall in bullish momentum. Ethereum Staging A Return To $3,000? Ethereum’s recent breakout above $2,600 is the first signal of a major shift in market sentiment. After weeks of trading below, the $2,600 price level seems to have now become an essential support zone for the cryptocurrency. Interestingly, this breakout sets the stage for the return of ETH to $3,000, with the funding rates playing an essential part. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,610 and is up by 8% in the past seven days. Notably, this price increase is more noticeable from a low of $2,171 on September 6, reflecting a 20% increase since then. The positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum is also moving towards institutional investors, which is reflected through Spot Ethereum ETFs. According to flow data, the ETFs, which initially started the week with a net outflow of $79.3 million on Monday, have now witnessed two consecutive days of $62.5 million and $43.2 million, respectively, on Tuesday and Wednesday. The combination of these inflows could play a significant role in whether Ethereum can breach the $3,000 price level and sustain above in the coming weeks.

42390316,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcMLYt,1727388902,"Crypto PACs Dominate Ohio Senate Race, Spending $40M on Sherrod Brown's Foe","Money from the political action committees backed by such crypto firms as Coinbase and Ripple Labs is helping lift the Republican challenger against Sen. Sherrod Brown, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee where crypto bills have languished.  Blockchain businessman Bernie Moreno has experienced a rapid rise in polling, some of which now put the Republican candidate atop Brown in the battleground state of Ohio.  The colossal campaign spending from the cryptocurrency industry is showing up in dominant fashion in Ohio's U.S. Senate race, where its political action committees have devoted $40 million to support Republican Bernie Moreno's opposition of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the crypto-skeptical chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.  In the largest single outlay of campaign spending from the digital assets sector, the latest Federal Election Commission filings show Fairshake PAC and its affiliates – specifically Defend American Jobs – have far outdistanced the initial $12 million the group announced at the start of its Ohio engagement. The spending, which has been devoted to pro-Moreno advertising, is the most any group has so far committed to this battleground.  Since Fairshake weighed in last month, the sentiment of Ohio voters has shown a major leap for blockchain businessman Moreno. At the start of August, he was at 39.6% support in one industry poll of likely voters obtained by CoinDesk, compared with 48.3% for Brown. The latest polling by ActiVote shows Moreno potentially pulling ahead with 51% to Brown's 49%, though that poll carried an almost 5% margin of error.  A broader average of polling also suggests steady gains for Moreno, with a 2.3 percentage point increase since Fairshake leapt into Ohio, according to the running tally of polls maintained by FiveThirtyEight.com, a political analysis site.  Read More: Crypto Fan Won Ohio Senate Primary That Could Alter the Industry's U.S. Destiny  Some crypto insiders have expressed private discomfort with Fairshake's decision to try to dethrone Brown, who currently has control of a significant segment of the Senate's crypto agenda. If Brown wins, and the Senate remains under a Democratic majority, he'll retain that authority, and this open warfare could hurt the industry's legislative drive. The decision had already cost the goodwill of one of Fairshake's significant donors and has resulted in ill will among high-profile Democrats.  Fairshake spokesman Josh Vlasto declined to comment on the Ohio strategy.  The outside spending in that state is going far toward bridging what is otherwise a massive gap in direct contributions to the candidates, meaning the fully disclosed individual contributions that are subject to spending limits and the full range of legal restrictions in U.S. elections laws. Veteran lawmaker Brown has received about $53 million, according to the most recent federal records, versus $16 million for Moreno.  Super PACs like Fairshake are only able to target candidates with so-called independent expenditures – advertising and other services that have no direct affiliation with or approval from the campaigns. In some races, Fairshake has spent millions on negative ads to oppose candidates that don't support pro-crypto policies, but in this one, the ads are positive in bolstering Moreno, an Ohio businessman and crypto enthusiast who founded a blockchain startup that focuses on property titles.  If Brown loses, the chances get much higher that Republicans take the Senate majority, and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) potentially becomes the next chairman. Though Scott's crypto views had long been muted, he recently cheered on digital assets innovations at the Nashville Bitcoin 2024 event, and at a symposium in Wyoming hosted by the SALT Conference, he floated a crypto-specific subcommittee if he wins the gavel.  ""We have to get rid of the folks who are in the way,"" Scott said in Nashville.  Fairshake made a splash when it quickly outpaced other industry PACs for the amount of cash it stockpiled for the 2024 elections: $169 million. It's used that war chest on candidates it considers good for the industry, and to oppose those who wouldn't be – especially if they've been backed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)  Despite Fairshake's origin – mostly funded by some of the crypto sector's most prominent names, including Coinbase Inc., Ripple Labs and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) – the ads don't typically mention digital assets at all.  The industry's favored candidates have won in about two dozen primary elections, meaning pro-crypto candidates will occupy a greater share of the seats of Congress next year. Since both the Senate and House of Representatives have been considered vulnerable to a reversal of their majorities, every shift in the landscape is potentially significant. Democrats have been holding onto the Senate with the barest possible majority – the tie-breaking vote of the vice president in an otherwise 50-50 split between the parties.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/26/crypto-pacs-dominate-ohio-senate-race-spending-40m-on-sherrod-browns-foe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c3b26db64a58d46f06cb32b6f8c6845342608c7-3683x2072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34020432,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644404,1727384400,"Bitcoin Price Forecast: Q4 Outlook Indicates Parabolic Move Toward $120,000","For the past five days, the Bitcoin price has remained locked in a narrow range between $62,000 and $64,000, following a surge of bullish sentiment triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut interest rates on September 18. This pivotal move by the Fed has sparked optimism among investors. Yet, Bitcoin has struggled to consolidate above the critical $64,000 level, which, if surpassed, could pave the way for a retest of previously lost resistance levels, potentially targeting $70,000 in the near term. Bitcoin Price Set To Reach New All-Time Highs? Despite this short-term stagnation, several analysts maintain an optimistic outlook for the Bitcoin price as the market approaches the fourth quarter (Q4) of the year. Market expert Lark Davis, for example, recently highlighted the historical trends that suggest the average return for Bitcoin during Q4 is a notable 88%. Davis suggested that if the Bitcoin price were to replicate this performance, it could soar to nearly $120,000. Even a more conservative estimate of a 55% gain – similar to last year’s performance – would take the price to $100,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Parabolic Rally To Trigger 5,500% Surge To $6, Here’s When In addition, the expert points out that this year offers unique catalysts that could drive significant price movements, including the launch of the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, the upcoming US elections, and the expected $16 billion in cash repayments from the collapsed FTX exchange. However, when analyzing the current state of the Bitcoin market, there are signs that current price movements are being “artificially constrained.” Analysts Warns Of Final Dip Before Further Price Gains Analyst InspoCrypto has noted that the price action has been persistently hovering around $63,000, with breakout attempts being blocked. A significant institutional options trader has reportedly executed a block trade that appears designed to keep Bitcoin’s price stable until October 4. InspoCrypto further explains that the Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) indicates a pattern of distribution even as prices rise, while the Futures CVD shows a divergence, suggesting that recent price increases have been primarily driven by futures trading. The Whales vs. Retail Ratio analysis from Hyblock supports this view, revealing that while whales are accumulating short positions, retail investors are predominantly betting on long positions—creating a potentially unfavorable scenario for the latter group. Yet, InspoCrypto believes that the market will see one final dip before reaching new all-time highs (ATHs) of $80,000 or even $85,000 for the largest cryptocurrency on the market. Related Reading: XRP Remains Bullish: Crypto Experts Unveil Predictions For The Price Adding to the technical analysis, analyst Ali Martinez points out that Bitcoin is currently testing its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at the $64,000 mark, which is acting as a short-term resistance level. A breakout above this key level could signal a significant bullish trend, according to Martinez. Looking further ahead, if the Bitcoin Long-Term Power Law holds true, Martinez believes the next market top could reach around $400,000, with predictions for this peak to occur by October of next year. Overall, while Bitcoin faces short-term challenges, the consensus among analysts is that the cryptocurrency is poised for new all-time highs in Q4 and into 2025, despite the current state of the market and BTC’s inability to overcome short-term hurdles. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $63,160, little changed from Monday’s price, and up 0.7% over the past 24 hours.

42390312,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcMLJV,1727384274,"Tornado Cash Dev Roman Storm’s Criminal Case Will Proceed to Trial, NY Judge Orders","The U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) case against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm will proceed to trial, a New York judge ruled during a telephonic hearing on Thursday.  District Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) denied Storm’s motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, saying his arguments about free speech, not receiving sufficient notice that he may be breaking the law and Tornado Cash's operations didn't hold enough water to overcome the DOJ's complaint, and that the government had brought plausible allegations against the developer.  “At this stage in the case, this court cannot simply accept Mr. Storm's narrative that he is being prosecuted merely for writing code,” Failla said. “If the jury ultimately accepts this narrative, then it will acquit. But there's no basis for me to decide that as a matter of law.”  Both Storm and his supporters have argued that to be prosecuted for writing code would be akin to being prosecuted for speech, suggesting that coding should be protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. But Failla didn’t buy it, saying “The functional capability of code is not speech within the meaning of the First Amendment.”  ""The Court finds that the government has a substantial interest in promoting a secure financial system by combating money laundering, by combating the operation of unregistered money transmitting services and by combating the evasion of sanctions,"" she said. ""These interests are wholly unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and the applicability of these laws to destroy conduct does not burden substantially more speech than necessary.""  Failla also said that she didn’t think that Tornado Cash was “meaningfully different” from other money transmitting businesses or financial institutions, and that the service was not “an altruistic venture,"" pointing to allegations that a venture capital fund provided financing in exchange for future profits, the relayer feature and the role of TORN tokens.  Along with fellow Tornado Cash developer Roman Semenov, Storm was indicted last August on three charges tied to their work with the privacy mixer – conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Powers Act (i.e. violating international sanctions).  Prosecutors have accused Tornado Cash and its developers of “knowingly” facilitating the laundering of more than $1 billion, including “hundreds of millions” from North Korea’s infamous hacking organization, the Lazarus Group.  Storm has pleaded not guilty to all charges. In his motion to dismiss filed in March, Storm’s lawyers argued that he simply wrote Tornado Cash’s code – anything criminal that subsequently happened with that code, they said, was out of his hands.  During Thursday’s hearing, Failla argued that, under the law, it didn’t matter whether Storm knew about the criminal uses of Tornado Cash.  “Now, the law is clear, but to be guilty of money laundering, the defendants need not be guilty of, involved in, or even aware of the specifics of the specified unlawful activity,” Failla said. “The government did not have to allege that Mr. Storm was aware of the specific nature of, much less a participant in, the underlying criminal activity.”  Read more: Conduct vs. Code May Be the Defining Question in Roman Storm Prosecution  Failla also denied another of Storm’s pending motions in the case – a motion to compel the DOJ to produce the defense with documents from Dutch authorities, who recently convicted another Tornado Cash developer, Alexey Pertsev, of money laundering.  Storm's team had not demonstrated that the material from Dutch authorities would be relevant, the judge ruled, calling his arguments too ""speculative.""  ""Of course the defense argues that because it does not know what's in those materials, it must couch its description in terms like 'may,'"" she said. ""There must be some showing that the MLAT materials are in fact, and not just in theory, relevant to the [case].""  Storm’s trial is currently set to begin in New York on Dec. 2, and is expected to last two weeks. If convicted on all three counts, he faces a maximum potential sentence of 45 years in prison.

Bitcoin is valued about $63,000 as of September 26, 2024; it shows some consistency following previous swings. Related Reading: Massive XRP Rally Incoming? Analyst Predicts 220% Price Jump – Details This price is still significantly higher than its value just a year ago when it hovered around $26,000. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and many analysts are weighing in on what lies ahead for Bitcoin. Predictions From Financial Institutions Various financial firms project different paths of pricing for Bitcoin. For instance, Standard Chartered recently changed their projection from an earlier forecast of $100,000 to $120,000 by the end of 2024. This change captures an increasing hope about the market potential of Bitcoin, particularly considering the major impact of the recent halving event. Conversely, Berenberg has been more circumspect, setting a target of $56,630 by April 2024. Their projection takes into account the possibility for significant market corrections. Fundstrat, however, has set a lofty aim of $180,000 since it believes that the introduction of a BTC ETF will increase prices. Such forecasts draw attention to the divergent opinions in the sector and show how greatly market attitude may change. Researcher Sees Bitcoin Targeting $68,000 Next Head of Research at Uphold Martin Hiesboeck has voiced hope on the foreseeable future of the crypto asset. He believes that Bitcoin is “ready” to break above the $68,000 mark, representing a potential increase of 6.67% from its current price. Looks like $BTC is ready to blow straight through to 68000 🤞 Happy trading! — Dr Martin Hiesboeck (@MHiesboeck) September 25, 2024 According to Hiesboeck’s research, Bitcoin has lately exhibited great momentum almost approaching $65,000 before encountering some opposition. He expects the bitcoin to keep on its rising slope and eventually reach the $68,000 mark. Variables Affecting Bitcoin’s Price The price of Bitcoin varies for several reasons. Unlike conventional equities that generally react to corporate performance or economic news, macroeconomic trends, technological improvements, and legislative changes can all affect the value of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Popcat Climbs By 35% – $1 Target Within Reach Institutional curiosity in Bitcoin also keeps rising. Many investors see it as a means of portfolio diversification and a hedge against inflation. Certified financial adviser Drew Feutz said: “The potential benefits of investing in crypto are potentially higher returns than traditional assets.” Many others agree that over time Bitcoin could outperform conventional stock and bond portfolios. The Road Ahead Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, forecasts range greatly. By 2030, some analysts estimate BTC valued between $400,000 and $1 million. These forecasts, however, are only hypothetical at best and mostly rely on macroeconomic conditions and external events including legislative changes.

34017564,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644905,1727377209,"Bitcoin Peaks At Highest Value In 2 Months Above $65,000: Bull Run Predictions","For the first time in nearly two months, Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the $65,000 mark, marking a significant recovery following two notable downturns in August and September. During these crashes, Bitcoin experienced a steep decline of 20% on two separate occasions, specifically on August 5 and September 6. However, as October approaches—a month often associated with a bullish resurgence for Bitcoin—market predictions are increasingly optimistic, suggesting that the cryptocurrency might be gearing up for another major uptrend. Could Bitcoin Reach $79,000 In October? On Thursday, Bitcoin recorded a 3% increase within a 24-hour period, reaching a price of $65,500. This upward movement has sparked discussions among analysts about whether this signals the start of a parabolic bull run. Related Reading: BlackRock Continues To Buy Bitcoin: Holdings Now Reach 358,000 BTC Worth $22 Billion Crypto investor Scott Melker expressed this sentiment, emphasizing that Bitcoin is currently attempting to establish its first higher high since peaking at $74,000 in March of this year. Melker noted that closing above $65,000 would confirm a new upward trend, transitioning from the lows of $50,000 observed in August. This pattern—a low, high, higher low, and higher high—suggests a bullish market structure replacing the previous bearish trends. Historically, October has been a strong month for Bitcoin, with analysts like Lark Davis pointing out that the average return during this month is approximately 22.90%. If Bitcoin were to experience a similar increase this year, it could potentially rise to around $79,000, surpassing its previous all-time high and overcoming key resistance levels. Such a move would set the stage for a powerful rally into November according to Davis’ analysis. Record-Breaking Performance In September In a further analysis, Rekt Capital provided insights into Bitcoin’s recent performance. He noted that September, often viewed negatively, turned out to be the best September for Bitcoin on record, with a 9% increase. Rekt also highlighted historical patterns related to Bitcoin’s Halving cycles, indicating that Bitcoin typically breaks out from its re-accumulation range approximately 154 to 163 days post-Halving. Currently, Bitcoin is 159 days past its last Halving that took place in April of this year. Based on previous cycles, Rekt believes that this timing suggests that a breakout could be imminent, reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin is well-positioned for significant gains in the near future. Related Reading: Dogecoin Eyes Bullish 50% Rally To $0.16, But Will A Crash Come First? The current resurgence can be attributed to the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed’s) dovish stance and recent 0.50% basis point (bps) interest rate cut on September 18, which was seen as a notable bullish catalyst not only for BTC but also for the broader market, which has followed Bitcoin’s performance to the upside in recent days. In addition, last week saw a resumption of inflows into the Bitcoin ETF market, following steady outflows throughout August and early September. For instance, US spot Bitcoin ETFs had a total net inflow of $106 million on Wednesday, continuing their net inflows for 5 consecutive days. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF had an inflow of $184 million. Overall, there seems to be a combination of bullish catalysts in place for the market’s largest cryptocurrency to continue its recovery, with massive gains expected in the last half of the year and early 2025.

Downside risks persist, including profit-taking potential and concerns about Mt. Gox repayments impacting Bitcoin’s supply. Technically, a daily candle close above the 200-day MA and 65k handle could trigger a bullish breakout, while a rejection might lead to a correction. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices have held the high ground over the past 7 days, flirting with a break of the 200-day MA and the psychological 65k handle. Acceptance above the 200-day MA could be a catalyst for further gains as ETF flows remain positive. According to SoSoValue, the total daily net inflow for BTC ETFs surpassed $100 million for the second consecutive day, marking a five-day streak of positive net inflows for these funds. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that this has turned the 30-day net holdings indicator for ETFs positive for the first time in September, indicating a growing trend of accumulation rather than sales. Source: CryptoQuant Optimism ( OP-USD ) continues to grow that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is ready for a bullish breakout as global Central Banks step up policy easing. Will a break above the 65k handle improve market sentiment and propel Bitcoin back above the 70k threshold? Downside Risks – Profit Taking and Mt. Gox Still in Focus As much as optimism has risen, this would not be the first attempt to break above crucial resistance areas in the last few weeks. Previous attempts have been futile, will this attempt be any different? My main concern is profit taking with Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) showing 84% profitability if the price languishes above the $63800 handle. An increase in UTXO is usually seen as a sign of improving investor confidence. Looking at the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, however, the story is a bit different. The index dropped around 10 points from yesterday to languish in neutral territory. Source: FinancialJuice Failure to push on and break above the 65k handle may see some short-term speculators cash in and look to enter on a pullback, which could lead to a correction and scupper attempts at a run toward the 70k handle. Mt Gox Repayments Back in Focus Mt Gox repayments are back in focus this week as the wallet appears to have shown signs of movement. On Wednesday, the bust crypto exchange emptied four of their wallets after receiving funds from the Kraken exchange. Arkham Intelligence asking the correct question, does this mean more repayments are on their way soon? The Mt Gox wallets hold 44,899 BTC worth $2.85 billion, with any significant repayments likely to stoke concern of an oversupply as creditors look to sell their Bitcoin. Such a move could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin prices and are definitely worth monitoring. Technical Analysis BTC/USD Bitcoin is currently trading around 3.5% up on the day and above the psychological 65k handle. A daily candle close above the 200-day MA and 65k handle may embolden bulls and be the catalyst for a push higher. A close above the 65350 handle may open up a clear run toward resistance at 68350 before the 70000 handle comes into focus. There is a descending trendline around the 70000 mark which could prove a stubborn hurdle, but beyond that, a clear run to the all-time high is a real possibility. Given the downside risks present, let’s take a look at the alternative. A rejection of the 200-day MA and a return of selling pressure could lead Bitcoin back toward support at the 100-day MA languishing at 61000. The area between the 100- and 50-day MA at 59900 is a key area of confluence and support and could keep any attempted push lower at bay. This area could form the base for a move beyond the all-time highs if it is able to hold firm.

34016138,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644704,1727373654,"Bitcoin Descending Triangle Formation Says A Crash Is Coming, How Low Can It Go?","A crypto analyst has just confirmed an impending Bitcoin (BTC) crash, pointing to the formation of a bearish descending triangle formation on the cryptocurrency’s price chart. With Bitcoin’s price holding strong above the $60,000 mark, the key question now is how low this anticipated downturn is. Analyst Confirms Incoming Bitcoin Crash TradingView crypto analyst, Alan Santana has published a report warning of potential risks in Bitcoin’s current price behavior, pointing to a possible price crash driven by the formation of a new descending triangle. Santana noted that currently, the price of Bitcoin is trading above $60,000, which is about 20% lower than its March 2024 All-Time High (ATH) of more than $73,000. The analyst hypothesized that if Bitcoin were trading at a lower price level of $37,000, this would represent a 50% decline from its March ATH. In such a case, this price would be seen as a strong correction from all-time highs. Santana also revealed that trading at $37,000 would be advantageous for Bitcoin, especially before a major political event like the upcoming United States (US) Presidential elections in November. This means that by trading below $40,000 or $37,000, Bitcoin would be due for a significant recovery to new highs. However, since BTC is currently trading at $63,635, a price mark close to a critical resistance level, this indicates a strong momentum. As such, if an unexpected event or market shakeout occurs, it could potentially trigger a massive price decline for the cryptocurrency. Moreover, Bitcoin has formed a descending triangle pattern, which the analyst has flagged as a bearish signal. He revealed that on the cryptocurrency’s monthly chart, this pattern broke to the downside, ultimately confirming an impending price crash. As a result, Santana has warned that investors should expect a Bitcoin crash, citing the cryptocurrency’s prolonged sideways movement with a bearish bias over the past six months. He further disclosed that BTC has been printing lower highs in the short-term and mid-term for more than six months, highlighting that lower highs were an indication of a bearish trend. Based on the cryptocurrency’s market behavior, descending triangle pattern and current price, Santana has predicted that Bitcoin could dip below $49,000. He noted that the next Fibonacci retracement level below $49,000 sits around $40,000 to $43,000, meaning the main target for this bearish forecast could be even lower. BTC Uptrend Hinges On $70,000 Breakout While emphasizing the potential for Bitcoin to crash below $49,000, Santana also disclosed that Bitcoin could witness a major uptrend if its price can successfully break above the $70,000 mark. He revealed that a strong confirmation above this price is necessary to consider BTC bullish this cycle. Specifically, if the cryptocurrency can achieve a one or two weekly or monthly close above $70,000, it could spark a bullish turnaround for the market. However, while Bitcoin is rising and maintaining a price above $60,000, the market is only seeing over-leveraged traders being liquidated and the growth of altcoins.

42390320,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcMKyz,1727372981,DePIN: Reshaping the Internet and Empowering Users,"In recent years, a handful of tech giants have gained an alarming amount of control of the internet, jeopardizing our data privacy and digital security. The recent CrowdStrike incident, where a single failure led to widespread disruption, is more than just a wake-up call — it's a loud warning that we’re facing a much bigger problem. But there’s a solution: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). DePIN offers a game-changing way to connect the physical world to the blockchain, completely overcoming the major flaws of our current centralized systems.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  DePIN networks cleverly link up physical devices like sensors, IoT gadgets, computers, and smartphones with decentralized blockchain networks. By sharing data, offering resources, or helping keep things running, users earn real rewards in digital assets — a fair deal that’s been a long time coming in the digital world. This setup doesn’t just empower users to benefit from their involvement; it frees them from the grip of centralized middlemen who’ve been exploiting the system for too long by profiteering from user data. These middlemen use this data for targeted advertising, marketing, and analytics, generating massive revenue while offering little in return to users.  The idea is simple: spread out physical infrastructure and reward people for contributing to the network. These contributions can be anything from sharing data about your driving habits or vehicle performance to renting out extra hard drive space, sharing your internet bandwidth, or connecting weather sensors for real-time environmental data. Instead of just handing over your data to big tech companies to monetize it, DePIN lets you share it and actually get paid. It’s more than just getting involved — it’s about making sure every user becomes a stakeholder in the infrastructure they rely on.  Real-World Applications  Today, DePIN-based projects are already reimagining countless aspects of our day-to-day lives. Take geolocation as an example, where blockchain networks like GEODNET are pushing the boundaries of location accuracy to centimeter-level precision, unlocking huge potential in fields like agriculture, construction, and drone operations. Such solutions allow farmers to fine-tune crop management like never before while construction projects could hit new levels of precision and autonomous drones could navigate with pinpoint accuracy — all thanks to a network powered by individuals who both contribute to and benefit from it.  In another instance, the rise of community-driven internet access, like WiFi Map’s 150 million active hotspots worldwide, isn’t just a new option. It’s a bold challenge to the outdated telecom monopolies. Meanwhile, DIMO allows people to collect, use, and monetize data from their vehicles, simultaneously offering developers special APIs to build applications to leverage this information for use cases like insurance, vehicle maintenance, and fleet management.  In another instance, Witness Chain, a DePIN proof system that has already attracted more than $5 billion worth of delegated stake from EigenLayer restakers, is actively working to unify the often siloed DePIN economy. The network allows disparate DePIN projects to share their physical locations, network capacities, and other data to connect with each other, establishing an end-to-end supply chain of decentralized infrastructure.  Other DePIN projects, such as mobile network operator XNET, are making strides to bring reliable network connectivity — which is today considered a human right by the UN — to the 2.9 billion people in the world who are still offline. XNET leverages the bandwidth reserved for Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) and carrier-grade Wi-Fi to build a decentralized community of network operators coordinating via a common blockchain.  Similarly, storage networks like Filecoin let people use their extra storage space to create a more resilient, efficient, and user-friendly alternative to traditional cloud storage. This shift makes such services more accessible and affordable while giving users control and a chance to earn from resources that would otherwise go to waste.  Ultimately, decentralization is not only improving access but also democratizes the core of our highly interconnected digital world.  What’s holding us back?  While current decentralized storage solutions may not yet match the cost-efficiency of centralized alternatives, this is a temporary hurdle; not a permanent barrier. However, this is a solvable problem. Better data compression and consumer-grade hardware advancements will lead to a ""sweet spot"" where decentralized cloud storage becomes as efficient as centralized options.  Technology is meant to be anti-fragile. The fact that we will suffer from massive outages due to single points of failure isn’t just inconvenient or unacceptable — it’s a damning indictment of our current system. But again, this problem is solvable too; we get there by truly decentralizing all aspects of our digital infrastructure, including often overlooked elements like provers in blockchain systems.  Open-source tools will power this transformation. ZK tools like Plonky3 are already being used to create provers and other critical infrastructure, with projects like Fleek leveraging these to power highly efficient decentralized provers.  The time for DePIN isn't just now — it's long overdue. Its potential to reshape our digital landscape isn't just exciting; it's absolutely necessary for the future of a free and open internet. We must act now to seize this opportunity and build the decentralized future we all deserve.

34013947,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644690,1727368235,WIF Bulls Push Hard Toward $2.1 Resistance Amid Market Optimism,"Dogwifhat (WIF) is on the verge of a major breakout, with bulls targeting the $2.1 level as upward momentum continues to build. After a strong period of gains, all eyes are on whether this momentum can trigger the price past this critical resistance. A successful push could ignite a broader rally, further solidifying WIF’s bullish outlook. As the market heats up, this article seeks to analyze WIF’s price action as it approaches the critical $2.1 resistance level, focusing on the bullish strength that has driven recent gains. By examining technical indicators, market sentiment, and potential key levels, the goal is to assess whether the bulls can sustain their push and trigger a breakout, or if bearish pressure may halt the rally. WIF, with a market capitalization surpassing $2.1 billion and a trading volume of over $528 million, was trading at around $2, indicating an 8.15% increase at the time of writing. In the last 24 hours, its market cap rose by 8.14%, while trading volume saw a decrease of 27.81%. Bulls Push Gains Steam: Can WIF Surpass The $2.1 Barrier? Following the recent trendline break, WIF’s price on the 4-hour chart has continued to gain momentum as it reaches $2.1, with the purpose of breaking past it. WIF is also trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggesting a positive upward trend that could lead to a potential breakout. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a potential for further upward movement. The RSI has risen again to the 70% threshold after previously dropping to 63%, indicating that positive movement is gaining strength. Related Reading: Dogwifhat On The Edge: Can WIF Hold Above $1.47 As Bears Close In? On the daily chart, WIF shows strong upside movement, reflected in multiple bullish candlesticks following a successful move above the 100-day SMA. This rising strength suggests that bulls are actively in control and may push the cryptocurrency higher, aiming to surpass the $2.1 mark. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a detailed examination of the RSI formation indicates that WIF may maintain its optimistic trajectory as the indicator’s signal line has risen above the 50% threshold and is currently positioned at 70%, displaying a sustained bullish outlook. How High Can The Meme Coin Go Post-Breakout If the upbeat momentum continues and WIF successfully breaks through the $2.1 resistance level, it could target the next resistance level at $3.5. A decisive move above this level might pave the way for additional gains, possibly reaching its all-time high of $4.8 and beyond. Related Reading: Dogwifhat Price Up 15%, Analyst Predicts it Will 25x in 2024 Conversely, if the breakout leads to profit-taking or bearish sentiment, WIF may retrace to the previous support level of $1.47. When this level is breached, it could result in deeper declines, potentially dropping toward $0.7122 and other lower ranges.

42390323,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcMLTl,1727366817,Canada's CBDC Departure Risks Web3's Interoperable Future,"Many of the world’s central banks are years into developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Per the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), 94% of the world’s central banks are actively working on CBDCs, while 19 of the G20 nations were in advanced stages of CBDC development prior to this month.  However, recent government decisions suggest changing sentiment around CBDCs. On September 23, Canada announced it was shifting its focus away from a retail CBDC to a focus on “broader payments.” This announcement closely follows Australia’s pivot to a wholesale CBDC over a retail currency.  Decisions regarding CBDC development impact more than an individual country’s citizens and financial system. They have serious implications for a problem facing the broader Web3 ecosystem – a lack of interoperability.  Minding the interoperability gap  CBDCs are more than just government-controlled digital money. They are a complex ecosystem that must account for different participants, use cases, tech stacks, data formats, and governance models. Not to mention, they must also be compatible with foreign CBDCs and legacy systems. Rolling out a functional CBDC is a tall order. However, it is not without parallel.  Read more: Fiorenzo Manganiello - Why We Won’t See CBDCs Everywhere  The world’s central banks are well aware of the formidable task ahead of them and have rightly been considering interoperability from the start. If anything, creating an interoperable CBDC ecosystem is even more daunting than Web3 interoperability. International cross-border payments, just one use case for CBDCs, are a complex and fragmented web of pre-existing, independent domestic payment systems and currency exchange challenges.  As such, central banks face enormous constraints when designing CBDCs. The pressure is on to be interoperable with legacy, contemporary, and, ideally, future financial systems. Beyond the obvious technical challenges, CBDCs must also comply with multiple legal and regulatory frameworks. Sound familiar?  These kinds of interoperability challenges have existed since Web3’s inception. Look no further than the two most prominent public blockchains: Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the surface, connecting these two networks seems obvious. Yet, the result of the industry’s best efforts is a collection of distinct stop-gap solutions, each requiring concessions in security, scalability, decentralization, or scope. As the CEO of the industry’s longest-running interoperability solution, Wanchain, I’ve witnessed all the progress we’ve made as an industry. Yet, I also recognize just how far we still are from true interoperability.  The widespread adoption of CBDCs provides a solution to the interoperability challenges holding back Web3. This is what makes Canada’s decision so significant – and frustrating. If too many governments abandon CBDCs, the CBDC landscape may end up looking like Web3 does today: a fractured ecosystem plagued by fragmented liquidity. With more than 100 L2s, 140+ active Layer 1s and countless private or consortium chains, the blockchain space already faces an existential threat. If we then add 75+ incompatible national CBDC networks… Let's just say the outlook is bleak.  But there may be a silver lining. Nations that remain steadfast in their pursuit of CBDCs will have a more prominent voice in setting the standards for CBDC interoperability. Such an advantage could be a game-changer for smaller nations with Web3-friendly landscapes. While this will likely not disrupt the current world order, it offers countries an avenue to ameliorate their standing on the global stage.  CBDCs: An Interoperability Blueprint  Unlike the public blockchains that preceded them, CBDCs have the opportunity to be inherently interoperable. There are a number of options available to central banks, some of which have already been tested in Web3.  Individual CBDCs can leverage universal messaging formats, cryptographic algorithms, and data structures. This mirrors ongoing efforts in Web3 interoperability, where universal standards are being developed. While intermediary relayers would still be necessary, operational complexity would be reduced. However, this approach may pose challenges for countries already employing standardized domestic technical interfaces.  Alternatively, CBDCs could operate on a single platform, allowing jurisdictions to set their own rules for transaction limits and participation. The IMF suggested a similar approach in 2023. Here, the challenge lies in determining who should run this platform, as reliance on contentious international powers could prove problematic in any global setting. There is also the option to link CBDCs directly via singular gateway entities or a hub-and-spoke model, though these present scalability and concentration risks. A reciprocal link model where participants in one system can directly transact with another likely offers better outcomes, though this model lacks clear parallels in Web3 and is, therefore, unproven.  Finally, a more realistic option might be a hybrid solution that blends elements to address specific use cases and the unique needs of different jurisdictions.  While the precise technical configuration is yet to be determined, CBDCs have a leg-up on existing Web3 interoperability solutions as they are a blank slate. CBDC design can be informed by the difficulties public blockchains have encountered trying to make already deployed systems interoperable after the fact. There is a rare opportunity for central banks to work closely with experienced developers to (finally) get interoperability right.  Interoperability and the CBDC Debate  A lack of interoperability remains one of the primary obstacles to developing CBDCs, and this echoes similar issues found in scaling Web3. In its current state, interoperability poses an existential threat to the mainstream adoption of both.  Yet, CBDCs have the potential to lay the groundwork for resolving these industry-wide interoperability challenges. To some, CBDCs elicit fears of pervasive government surveillance and control. To others, they are unnecessary in the age of stablecoins. But we should not ignore the contributions CBDCs can make for the long-term health of Web3 as a whole. It’s time for a unified and decentralized network of blockchains built on industry-wide interoperability standards.

Traders anticipate another cut to come at the Fed's next meeting on Nov. 7, with current betting favoring another 50 basis point reduction, according to the CME FedWatch Tool  The more immediate catalyst Thursday for not just bitcoin, but global markets in general, was China, where authorities are reportedly considering injecting up to 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) of capital into that country's biggest state banks in an effort to revive the struggling economy.

42390325,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcMM3f,1727365226,"Inflation Should Moderate in August, Boosting the Crypto Outlook","Inflation growth keeps falling.  One of my most vivid memories of the COVID pandemic was rediscovering lunch. The moment that I fondly remember was realizing my favorite deli, The Wine Merchant, was still open for business.  You see, for the initial three to four weeks of the pandemic, my wife, children, and I really didn’t leave our neighborhood. Other than going to the grocery store for food or Target for things like cleaning supplies, we kept to ourselves. But, after talking with friends who were still going into the office and getting take-out lunch, I was jealous. And the next day, I headed out for a sandwich.  One thing you need to understand is that I’m a creature of habit. So, I can go for years getting the same thing for lunch every day. And my go to sandwich is turkey with Swiss cheese and Dijon mustard on rye, add a half order of salami. In addition, I grab a bag of UTZ barbeque chips and two bottled cokes. If prices change, I notice.  When I first showed up, I still paid the same $12 I had prior to COVID. Then as time dragged on, I noticed prices started to creep up. By the end of the first year my lunch cost $15… Within two years it was $18… And by the end of the third year it had risen to $20. But lately I’ve noticed a change…. The price has held steady.  To get a visual of what I’m talking about, look at the price of white bread over the same time frame…  In the chart above the price of white bread was $1.36 at the end of 2019. In the early part of 2020, prices held steady. Then, by the end of the year, they had jumped 13% to $1.54. In 2021, prices held steady before surging 21% in 2022. In 2022, the pace of growth slowed, increasing another 8%. But this year, the price of bread has stabilized and eased.  This dynamic reminds me very much of the national inflation picture. As the cost of goods has risen, demand has cooled. Individuals may not be eating lunch out as much as they used. The dynamic shift tells me that price pressures should ease more when August personal consumption expenditures are reported at the end of September. That will support more rate cuts this year by the Federal Reserve and underpin a steady rally in risk assets like cryptocurrency.  But don’t take my word for it, let’s look at what the data’s telling us…  If we want to get an idea of what PCE growth looks like, we need to study the big picture. So, we must observe the number on an annualized basis. That way, we don’t let any one-off monthly surges distort the more important long-term picture.  The headline PCE index component breakdown works out to be roughly 35% goods and 65% services. So, services are going to have a bigger influence on the gauge’s direction. However, core PCE (minus food and energy) is what we really want to watch.  So, let’s take it a step further. Food and energy fall under non-durable goods (last less than three years). That subset makes up around two-thirds of the PCE goods part, with durable goods (last longer than three years) making up the other third.  Read more: Scott Garliss - The Fed Must Have Confident Consumers  The central bank likes to remove food and energy because the prices are volatile. That way, policymakers feel like they’re smoothing out the numbers. So, when we back them out of the inflation equation, we’re left with a core PCE index that is largely made up of services prices.  Now, let’s take a closer look at the services component. It accounts for the divergence between the BEA and BLS inflation measures. That’s why PCE growth tends to be shallower than the CPI.  In PCE, housing including utilities is roughly 17%, healthcare is about 17%, financial services and insurance is around 8%, other services almost 8%, food (remember service side) and accommodations is roughly 8%, recreation services 4%, and transportation around 3%. That’s vastly different from CPI where housing makes up over 36% while medical services is just 6%.  According to BLS, in August, shelter prices rose 0.5%, medical care services contracted 0.1%, financial services decreased 0.3%, insurance costs declined 0.2%, hotel room costs rose 1.8%, recreation services were unchanged, and transportation and warehousing services slid 0.1%.  If we adjust those numbers on a weighted basis, we get an almost 0.2% increase for August. That’s in-line with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and consensus expectation for 0.2% growth.  So now, let’s look at what year-over-year growth will look like at 0.2%...  According to my forecast, 0.2% monthly growth would translate to 2.7% core PCE on an annualized basis. That would be in-line with Wall Street’s expectation for a 2.7% increase but below the Cleveland Fed’s forecast of 2.8%.  More importantly, the average rate of growth over the last six months would be running at 0.2%. That would translate to 2.4% core growth on an annualized basis. That would be below the current rate and implies the pace should continue to slow moving forward.  If PCE plays out as I expect, it will boost the outlook for easier money policies from the Fed. Because based on the new rate of inflation and the effective fed funds rate, real interest rates will have a 2.7% cushion to the downside before they stop weighing on inflation growth.  In other words, the change will give our central bank plenty room to start cutting interest rates without stoking an inflation rebound. That should support the outlook for economic growth to slow, but not collapse, and underpin a steady rally in risk assets like bitcoin and ether.

42417166,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTOlP3,1727364117,How a Harris 'Opportunity Economy' Will Benefit the Crypto Industry,"Single-issue crypto voters overwhelmingly support Donald Trump for good reason. The Biden administration’s hostile stance on digital assets is now being attributed to Kamala Harris, and Trump has overwhelmingly embraced the industry in recent months. If you are purely looking at what the candidates publicly say (or don’t say), it is logical to believe Trump will do more for the industry. However, if you look more closely at the broader platform of each candidate, I believe it becomes clear that a Harris administration will create a better long-term environment for crypto to thrive. Kamala Harris finally broke her silence on digital assets in recent days. At a New York City fundraiser Sept. 22 she said she would “encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting our consumers and investors."" On Sept. 25 in Pittsburgh, she said that she wants the U.S. to be “dominant in blockchain.”  These comment comes more than a month after Democratic cryptocurrency industry leaders coalesced to form the Crypto4Harris movement which hosted a Town Hall advocating for a Democratic “reset” on digital asset policy. And I acknowledge they were modest comments in comparison to Trump’s 180 degree pivot from skeptic to supporter. For many, they were the first clear signs of her willingness to support the industry. But those of us who have been following the paper trail and reading the tea leaves saw this coming. Her advisors and surrogates have made supportive overtures, her campaign staff have participated in thoughtful dialogue, Democratic Congressional leaders including Senate Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) have made it clear where they stand, and her own comments, platform, and tagline have hinted at a departure from the Biden administration’s restrictive crypto policies. Industry insiders are confident that a “reset” is coming under a potential Harris administration. I argue that, despite the contrast in public statements made by each candidate on crypto, a Kamala Harris presidency would be more beneficial for our future digital economy. First I will highlight ways in which the former President’s words don’t match his actions, and the many ways he has lied or exaggerated to gain an advantage. Then I outline why Harris’ vision of an “Opportunity Economy” will benefit our industry more broadly. Here are some reasons to be skeptical of Trump:  No Presidential Action: Joe Biden was certainly no crypto champion, but neither was Trump. Trump did nothing to support the industry during his four years in office. In fact, he started the Treasury Department’s Operation Hidden Treasure which served as the precursor to Chokepoint 2.0. He also openly called cryptocurrency a scam — making him the only presidential candidate to do so.  Uneducated & Impractical Policy Proposals: Many of the policy proposals that Trump has made are little more than vague platitudes and empty promises. His statement that crypto should be “made in America” highlights his ignorance on the decentralized nature of validating the technology, his promise to “fire” SEC Chair Gary Gensler is formally outside the power of presidential authority, and his claim that bitcoin could offset our national debt is simply silly.  He is only following the money: Trump’s pivot to supporting the industry can be closely tracked by following the paper trail of mega-donors to his campaign. Starting with Andressen Horowitz and the Winklevii brothers, his increased engagement comes in direct correlation to donors expressing support for his campaign. For better or worse, the crypto industry accounts for almost half of all corporate political donations this cycle. Additionally, his recent business venture World Liberty Financial has made contradictory claims: first announced as accessible to accredited investors, but later introduced a public token (of which 20% of the total supply is reserved for Trump family members). This has raised ethical concerns and led many experts to believe his interest only lies in lining his pockets.  While Trump admittedly has made very specific policy recommendations for crypto, his general economic policy is starkly vague. In comparison, Harris has outlined a detailed strategy for creating what she calls an “Opportunity Economy,” a vision that re-introduces the long lost concept of social mobility and addresses the core structural failures of the American economy. By addressing policy issues of education, small business development, and ensuring a strong rule of law, our economy — and digital economy — is poised for a rebound after decades of middle class stagnation.  Here's how a Harris ‘Opportunity Economy’ will encourage digital asset innovation:  Child tax credits, education policy, and technical job training: Harris’s Opportunity Economy places a strong emphasis on reinvigorating the middle class through a combination of child tax credits, improved education policies, and expanded access to technical job training. These programs are crucial for digital asset innovation. By creating an educated and skilled workforce, the Harris administration would foster the kind of talent necessary to sustain and expand the blockchain and crypto ecosystem. This focus on human capital directly benefits the decentralized technologies of tomorrow.  Emphasis on Small Business Support through the $50K Startup Credit: One of the key pillars of Harris’ platform is the $50K startup credit, designed to empower small businesses to take off. This policy is essential for blockchain entrepreneurs who need early-stage capital to launch their businesses. Crypto thrives in an environment that supports grassroots innovation. Small businesses are the backbone of a healthy economy, and competition in the blockchain ecosystem will encourage growth. Harris’ experience in Silicon Valley and SME policies reflects an understanding that the next wave of decentralized technology will not come from large corporations but from small, agile players.  The Importance of the Rule of Law for Functioning Markets: Most importantly, as a former District Attorney, we can be confident that the rule of law will be stronger under a Harris administration than that of a convicted felon. Stable, transparent, and predictable regulations and institutions foster trust in the system, enabling local businesses to thrive without fear of abrupt legal changes. This not only secures U.S. investors but also sends a strong signal to global markets, reassuring foreign investors that the U.S. is a safe and innovative place to do business. By instilling confidence through rule of law, Harris’ economic plan will bolster both local and international interest in digital assets, creating a stable environment for growth.  Harris's holistic and pragmatic approach to economic reform driven by data and inclusive tent of varied and various viewpoints, will lead to broader national benefits. A thriving middle class is key to sustainable growth, and her plan emphasizes redistributing opportunity by supporting those historically left behind. Her focus on education, workforce training, small business innovation, and the rule of law creates an economy that serves everyone, not just the wealthy elite — a core value of the crypto community. Her commitment to regulatory transparency enhances market stability, crucial for long-term growth. This balanced approach will ensure all Americans benefit from economic prosperity.  Harris's broader economic policies are well-researched and detailed. Now that she’s endorsed the industry, I believe her digital asset policies will follow suit. I hope we hear more measured comments from the VP on this topic before the election — unlike Trump’s unpredictable tactics. I am certain the United States will be stronger under a Harris administration, and am confident the digital asset industry will be, too.

The team promised several large incentives to players, such as an “equally important” reward system which was never met. The use of “keys” during the final weeks of Season 1 also caused confusion since no clear information was issued regarding importance, with some players focusing just on collecting keys to later find out they are banned for shortchanging. Boycott Threats And Community Backlash The community’s dismay of the token distribution has resulted in a notable pushback. Many of the players labeling the airdrop a “scam” have expressed their wrath on social networking sites. Some have even promised to sell their tokens right away after listing and abstain from the game. The Hamster Kombat team has not yet provided a clear explanation or resolution for the community’s concerns. With millions of players potentially selling their tokens, the listing could face significant volatility and downward pressure on the HMSTR price. Those who follow the project actively and invest in the premarket should know that the price of the token may skyrocket to its correct value and drop to low levels. Most of the players and investors are seeing great hope in the listing, but this issue that came recently should make them take cautious steps. Meanwhile, Hamster Kombat will have to answer the complaints of the community and rebuild confidence when the dust settles if it is to keep its success and appeal over the long haul.

42417175,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTOlXJ,1727362800,Crypto for Advisors: The Growth of Bitcoin as Collateral,"In today’s issue, Adam Reeds, CEO of Ledn, looks at the evolving landscape of bitcoin financing products in the market as the number of opportunities to use bitcoin as collateral is growing.  In Ask an Expert, Kevin Tam from Raymond James answers questions about crypto trends, regulatory changes and sovereign ownership of cryptocurrencies.  –Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Bitcoin Financing Rewrites the Rules for Asset Managers  As traditional investment products face declining yields, savvy asset managers must consider emerging opportunities within the cryptocurrency space to meet growing client demand. Bitcoin and ether have moved from speculative corners into the mainstream of institutional portfolios, driven by the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and a growing appetite for yield in a low-interest-rate environment.  Are advisors meeting client interest in this asset class?  The recent regulatory approval of spot bitcoin ETFs has significantly expanded the accessibility of digital assets. We’ve seen new net inflows of $17 billion, meaning new buyers and a tailwind for bitcoin prices.   Financial institutions, including notable players like Goldman Sachs, are taking substantial positions, with Goldman reportedly purchasing $400 million worth of bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. This move signals not only the growing legitimacy of crypto as an asset class but also institutional confidence in its role as a portfolio diversifier. Analysts at Standard Chartered have projected fund inflows between $50 billion and $100 billion into bitcoin and crypto products by the end of 2024 as wealth managers and advisors reassess their strategies to meet client interest.  The opportunity in Bitcoin financing  For wealth managers and institutional advisors seeking to keep pace with client demand while enhancing returns, Bitcoin financing presents an untapped opportunity. Bitcoin-backed loans and financing structures are emerging as competitive alternatives to traditional fixed-income products like bonds, which have struggled to deliver meaningful yields amid the global low-interest-rate environment. Bitcoin loans, which often come with high spreads and are over-collateralized, can offer superior yields with comparable risk to traditional fixed-income strategies.  The economics of bitcoin-backed lending are particularly attractive in the current financial landscape. As traditional fixed-income products struggle to provide meaningful returns, bitcoin-backed loans are delivering significantly higher yields, often in the range of 7.5-12.5%. This premium exists due to the perceived risk in the digital asset industry, but as more traditional institutions enter the space, this premium may shrink over time.  Bitcoin-backed loans mitigate risk through over-collateralization, and bitcoin's unique market dynamics – including its 24/7/365 liquidity – provide an additional advantage for asset managers. Unlike bonds, which are subject to market hours and liquidity constraints, bitcoin-backed loans allow for the liquidation of large positions at any time, offering enhanced flexibility in managing portfolio risk.  Institutional adoption is on the rise  The movement into crypto isn’t limited to speculative investments; it has caught the attention of institutional investors, including pension funds. Recent moves by large pension funds like the Wisconsin Investment Board and the Fairfax County Employees’ Retirement System reflect a growing shift towards diversifying into crypto. These pension funds, like others globally, have been forced to reevaluate their portfolios as traditional income strategies falter in the face of low yields and rising inflation.  Historically, pension funds have relied heavily on stocks and bonds, often using liability-matching strategies to meet long-term obligations. However, the need for portfolio diversification has seen an increasing allocation to alternative assets like private equity, real estate, and now digital assets. Bitcoin-backed financing, with its strong collateral requirements and potential for higher yield, offers an appealing option for those looking to hedge against macroeconomic volatility and inflation while enhancing returns.  Meeting client interest and fiduciary duty  For financial advisors, the key question remains: are they doing enough to meet client interest in crypto assets? According to recent surveys, approximately 39% of family offices are already actively investing in cryptocurrencies, with many more expressing interest in diversifying into digital assets. However, there is still a gap between client interest and advisor action. Advisors who are proactive in understanding the opportunities in bitcoin financing and other crypto products are not only responding to client demand but are also positioning themselves as forward-thinking, innovative partners in wealth management.  The rapid adoption of crypto-backed financing solutions offers a compelling case for advisors who are looking to meet client interest in alternative assets while delivering superior performance in a challenging market environment. By embracing bitcoin financing, wealth managers can provide their clients with access to a new avenue for yield enhancement, portfolio diversification, and inflation hedging.  As the global financial landscape continues to evolve, advisors have a unique opportunity to lead the way in embracing bitcoin and other digital assets as a core part of their investment strategy. The ability to offer innovative solutions like bitcoin-backed loans not only helps meet client interest but also reinforces an advisor’s fiduciary duty to explore all viable options for enhancing returns in today’s low-yield world.  - Adam Reeds, co-founder and CEO of Ledn  Ask an Expert  Q. What are the main trends shaping the crypto market?  The current primary trend is the institutional adoption of bitcoin as a digital asset and a store of value.  Institutional adoption continues to unfold in many ways, including the launch of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs that allow investors to buy and hold exposure to bitcoin directly. Additionally, options markets are emerging, and bitcoin has been considered for inclusion in mutual funds and ETF portfolios. Fidelity Canada has a 1-3% bitcoin allocation with their ownFidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF Fund, which is a fund of funds with exposure to various asset classes. These developments are positive indicators of institution adoption and are expected to continue moving the crypto market forward.  Institutional investors have considered alternative assets like bitcoin to diversify their portfolios and hedge against inflation. Hedge fund billionaires Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones have publicly endorsed bitcoin as part of a well-diversified portfolio.  Additionally, BlackRock, the biggest asset fund manager in the world, with $10 trillion in assets under management for institutional clients(including central banks), discusses bitcoin's unique position as a diversifier in investment portfolios.  Q. What are the existing regulatory frameworks governing crypto?  In Canada, the regulatory environment for digital assets is clear and supportive, with the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) requiring crypto trading platforms to register and comply with securities laws, like KYC and AML regulations.  The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US applies a regulation-by-enforcement approach by actively pursuing action against major players in the crypto space. Going afterunregistered broker-dealers, exchanges and clearing houses. In most cases, this results in court decisions that set a precedent for future cases.  While Canada has a more cohesive regulatory framework that encourages innovation in cryptocurrency markets, the US has challenges due to its fragmented approach. Other countries are watching these developments closely as they form their regulatory landscape to foster growth while ensuring investor protection.  Q. Which country owns the most bitcoin?  El Salvador has accumulated 5,748 bitcoin on the open market and has used it as legal tender since 2021.  The Kingdom of Bhutan owns 13,029 bitcoin worth more than $780 million, and they started mining in 2019 with their vast hydroelectric energy sources.  Other countries, such as the USA with 215,000 bitcoin, China with 190,00 bitcoin, the United Kingdom with 61,000 bitcoin and Germany with 50,000 bitcoin, have seized bitcoin from companies that have contravened local securities legislation. Generally, the respective governments will conduct public auctions to sell off the confiscated assets.  - Kevin Tam, Digital Asset Research Specialist & Senior Branch Compliance Supervisor, Raymond James Ltd.  Keep Reading  According to Citi’s “Global Family Office 2024 Survey Report”, the number of family offices that are optimistic about cryptocurrency ownership has increased this year, and they are primarily interested in direct ownership.

34010232,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24105,1727359312,What is Hamster Kombat (HMSTR)?,"Hamster Kombat is a popular play-to-earn game that has quickly garnered a massive following of 200 million users since its launch in March 2024. Hosted on Telegram, this game allows users to engage in virtual battles with hamsters, earning in-game currency and rewards along the way. The game’s integration with The Open Network (TON) blockchain, which is tightly integrated with Telegram, ensures a secure, decentralised experience where players can convert their earned “Hamster Coins” into real-world cryptocurrency, adding an exciting financial dimension to the gameplay. The upcoming launch of the HMSTR cryptocurrency token represents a significant achievement for the game and its community. This token will not only serve as the in-game currency but also extend its utility across other products in the Hamster ecosystem. The Hamster Foundation, a non-profit organisation, will oversee the development and sustainability of the HMSTR token, ensuring it remains a community-driven asset without the pressures of traditional venture capital backing. The token launch, including what is expected to be the largest airdrop in crypto history, will further engage players and solidify the game’s standing in the play-to-earn sector. Trade Hamster Kombat Now One of the unique aspects of Hamster Kombat is its focus on community engagement. The game’s viral success is partly due to its strong social features, such as a referral system that rewards players for inviting friends, and daily challenges like the Daily Cipher Code and Combo Card , which offer significant rewards. With millions of players worldwide, the game has created a vibrant and active community, bolstered by its presence on platforms like Telegram and Twitter, where it boasts tens of millions of followers. As Hamster Kombat prepares for its token launch and continues to expand its features, it sets a new standard for combining gaming with financial rewards. The game’s success is a testament to the growing appeal of play-to-earn models, and its upcoming developments are poised to attract even more players and investors, further integrating the worlds of gaming and cryptocurrency. Join the Hamster Kombat discussion in our Discord! What is the HMSTR Token? The HMSTR token is the native cryptocurrency of the Hamster Kombat ecosystem, designed to serve as both an in-game currency and a foundational element of a digital economy within the platform. Launched by the Hamster Foundation, a non-profit organisation committed to driving the adoption of Web3 technologies, the HMSTR token plays a critical role in incentivising user participation and engagement across the various features and activities of Hamster Kombat. Unlike many other crypto projects, the HMSTR token is community-driven, meaning its value and development are shaped by the interests and actions of its users rather than by external investors or venture capital firms. Within the Hamster Kombat game, HMSTR tokens are used for a variety of purposes, from purchasing upgrades and items for your virtual hamsters to participating in exclusive events and challenges. The token is also earned through gameplay, particularly by completing tasks such as Daily Cipher Codes, Daily Combo challenges, and other in-game activities. This play-to-earn model not only enhances the gaming experience but also allows players to accumulate real value, which can be converted into other cryptocurrencies or used within the ecosystem. Beyond the game itself, the HMSTR token is envisioned as a multi-purpose asset within the Hamster ecosystem. It will support transactions across different platforms and products that are being developed under the Hamster brand. For example, as the ecosystem expands to include new games, tools, and services, the HMSTR token will be integral to facilitating seamless interactions and exchanges between users. This creates a cohesive and interconnected digital environment where the token’s utility is constantly being reinforced and expanded. The HMSTR token’s launch is accompanied by what is anticipated to be the largest airdrop in cryptocurrency history, signalling the project’s commitment to widespread distribution and community involvement. By ensuring that a significant portion of the token supply is allocated to players and community members, the Hamster Foundation aims to foster a decentralised and user-centric ecosystem. This approach not only drives adoption but also aligns the token’s growth with the interests of its most active participants, ensuring that the HMSTR token remains a central and valuable asset within the evolving Hamster Kombat universe.

With major developments such as an increase in participation from both small and large investors, as well as indicators turning bullish, the DOGE price looks primed for a major recovery. However, there could be a small roadblock for the meme coin when it comes to achieving this uptrend as one analyst has pointed out the possibility of a further crash from here. A Crash Or A Surge For DOGE? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has presented a forecast for the Dogecoin price with mixed signals for the future. The analysis focuses on both the bullish and bearish possibilities for the meme coin as it continues to trade in a trading range. Both of these scenarios are possible, with the Stochastic RSI may win out this time. Related Reading: Shiba Inu On The Edge Of Historic Run As Investors Accumulate 770 Billion SHIB According to the analysis, the Stochastic RSI has made a bearish crossover for the Dogecoin price. This bearish crossover suggests that there is a price crash coming for the altcoin. In this case, the DOGE price could be falling below $0.1 again. Not only this, but Dogecoin may lose around 15% of its value if this bearish scenario were to play out. This could see the DOGE price fall as low as $0.087 in the worst case scenario. On the flip side, the Dogecoin price is also showing some bullish tendencies, as the crypto analyst points out. The price is apparently “flirting with a bullish breakout,” which could be significant if it plays out. In this case, the bullish breakout could see the meme coin’s price rise as high as $0.16 and that would mean a 45% breakout from the current price. #Dogecoin keeps flirting with a bullish breakout, but patience might be key! The Stochastic RSI just had a bearish crossover, hinting at a potential short-term correction before the next move. pic.twitter.com/IZNsTJHksT — Ali (@ali_charts) September 25, 2024 Dogecoin Looking For A Breakout The crypto analyst has previously presented bullish scenarios for the Dogecoin price but chalked it up to two key signals. The first of which is the RSI actually making a successful break out of the descending trending on the daily chart. Second of these is a break above the $0.11 resistance on the chart. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies Cardano Buy Signal And Parabolic Rally To Send ADA Price To $5 One of these signals had been triggered, with the RSI breaking the descending trendline. However, that has since changed as the Stochastic RSI has actually turned bearish in the meantime. The DOGE price is still trending below $0.1, suggesting that bears are still well in control of the price. These developments show more potential for the Dogecoin price to actually crash from here before a recovery. But in the event of a market-wide recovery, DOGE could end up following the uptrend regardless.

42417158,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTOlFl,1727355600,Crypto Hackers Nabbed $409M in Q3: Immunefi,"$409 million stolen in the third quarter, 40% less than in the year-earlier period.  The majority of stolen funds can be attributed to the hacks of WazirX and BingX, with $235 million and $52 million being stolen respectively.  DeFi remains an unparalleled opportunity for blackhat hackers, Immunefi said.  Hackers stole $409 million worth of cryptocurrency in the third quarter, and an additional $3 million was lost to fraud, according to a report by Immunefi.  The figure is 40% less than in third-quarter 2023, the bug bounty platform said.  The amount of capital locked on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols represents an ""unparalleled and attractive opportunity for blackhat hackers,"" Immunefi said. There is currently $87.2 billion in total value locked (TVL) across DeFi, according to DefiLlama.  Most the quarter's losses came from hacks of crypto exchanges, with India's WazirX losing $235 million and Singapore's BingX $52 million. The report said 32 other hacks accounted for 32% of total losses.  ""We're seeing a higher number of incidents targeting DeFi, while CeFi experiences fewer incidents but often with more severe consequences, with hundreds of millions in stolen funds in a single exploit,"" said Mitchell Amador, founder and CEO of ImmuneFi.  ""In CeFi, the biggest infrastructural issue is private key management, which is essential to maintaining the self-custody of crypto assets but is not typically subject to security audits. It requires rigorous key management policies, practices, and emergency plans.""  WazirX lost funds after hackers compromised the exchange's private keys. The exchange halted withdrawals and froze trading on July 18, and is now seeking a moratorium from Singapore's courts to give it time to restructure.  The Ethereum blockchain was the most common target for hackers, with 15 incidents of theft reported compared with eight on BNB Chain and two on Base.  There were also two incidents of funds being recovered after being stolen.

42417160,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTOlIr,1727355600,Avalanche Unveils $40M Grant Program Ahead of 'Avalanche9000' Upgrade,"The foundation supporting the Avalanche network is releasing a $40 million grant program to reward developers for building new protocols in the blockchain ecosystem.  The program, called Retro9000, is supposed to encourage developers to build on Avalanche ahead of a much-anticipated upgrade known as Avalanche9000, the Avalanche Foundation said Thursday in a press release.  “Normally, you ship a big upgrade to testnet, and if everything looks good, you immediately ship it to mainnet, and then you hopefully get adoption for it,” said Luigi D'Onorio DeMeo, chief operating officer at Ava Labs, the main developer firm behind Avalanche, in an interview with CoinDesk. “We kind of want to spin that on its head a little bit, and instead elongate the testnet process and do sort of what you can call an incentivized testnet.”  Builders and users will have to register with the Retro9000 platform to build on Avalanche, where the users receive some voting credits, based on their activity on the network.  “They'll be able to effectively vote with those credits during the incentivized testnet on the builders, and this is going to be used as a signal for the Avalanche Foundation to then retroactively grant the participants afterwards,” D'Onorio DeMeo said.  “For a builder to actually qualify for the retroactive grant, they will have to eventually deploy on mainnet,"" D'Onorio DeMeo said. ""That is a prerequisite. The goal here is to allocate a substantial amount of funds, to build up a strong pipeline on testnet, so that when we go to mainnet, there's a bunch of stuff to launch.”  AVAX Price  Avalanche9000 is expected to be Avalanche’s largest upload since its mainnet launch in 2020. It’s supposed to make launching layer 1s on Avalanche cheaper, easier to customize and smoother to maintain.

42417165,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTOlO1,1727354650,Bitcoin Jumps Over $64K on China Stimulus; IBIT Options Could Provide Longer-Term Boost,"Bitcoin climbed above $64,000 in early U.S. trading hours ahead of a number of Fed speakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, and after China's Politburo reportedly pledged continuing support to that country's economy and markets.  Bitcoin could see increased interest from retail and institutional investors following the approval of options trading on BlackRock's IBIT.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is again setting its sights on the $65,000 level not touched since the first week in August, with a speech later today from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell potentially the next catalyst.  “The market will be following Powell’s speech closely for indications of any shifts in sentiment following last Thursday’s FOMC press conference, which signaled the potential for further easing,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message. The Fed Chair, however, did not comment on monetary policy or the economic outlook.  The Fed announced its first round of cuts last week - leading to risk assets such as bitcoin surging - and traders expect a 62% chance of an additional 50 basis point reduction in November, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  Gold notched another in what's become a series of record highs of late, climbing nearly 1% to above $2,700 per ounce. China is reportedly mulling a $142 billion capital injection into its banking system, along with a number of other stimulus measures. The Shanghai Composite soared another 3.6% and is on track for its best week in a decade. U.S. stock index futures are ahead about 1%.  Bitcoin’s appeal is starting to grow among retail and professional investors alike. Data from SoSoValue shows that the total daily net inflows cracked $100 million for the second day in a row for the BTC ETFs, marking a five-day streak of positive net inflows for the funds.  On the other hand, retail bitcoin investors have accumulated 35,000 BTC in the past 30 days, highlighting increased confidence and participation from smaller holders.  Meanwhile, some say the newly-approved options on BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has primed BTC for further gains ahead.  “The approval would increase liquidity and investor participation in the Bitcoin market, marking a further step toward broader institutional adoption,” onchain analysis firm CryptoQuant shared in a note with CoinDesk. “Indeed, Bitcoin options on the CME recorded a fresh high open interest of almost half a billion on March 12, 2024, growing by almost five-fold from their maximum level in 2023.”  UPDATE (Sept. 26, 13:25 UTC): Headline and body changed following Powell's remarks, which didn't touch on monetary policy or the economic outlook.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/26/bitcoin-jumps-over-64k-ahead-of-powell-speech-ibit-options-could-provide-longer-term-boost,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da81f19c01c4676669a420bfb1d31e6a27fb95c4-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Other major tokens also registered gains, with ether adding 0.4% to $2,630. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a weighted measurement of the digital asset market at large, rose nearly 1.2%. In other markets, gold hit a record high and Asian stocks surged amid reports that China's central bank will inject around $142 billion of stimulus into the biggest state banks to increase their capacity to support the struggling economy.  Bitcoin ETF inflows cracked $100 million for the second consecutive day on Wednesday and stretched their winning streak to five days. That flipped an indicator tracking 30-day net holdings among ETFs to positive for the first time this month, data from CryptoQuant shows, suggesting a rising trend of accumulation as opposed to sales. Ether ETFs enjoyed a second consecutive day of inflows, netting $43.2 million. While the ETH products remain over $500 million in the red since they listed in July, ether has outperformed bitcoin since the Fed's rate cut last week, which coincided with an increase in network transactions and rising Ethereum transaction costs, known as gas fees.  Ethereum layer 2 Celo is challenging Tron's position as the blockchain with the most daily active addresses using stablecoins. The seven-day moving average of the measure on Celo has climbed to nearly 700,000, nearly matching Tron's tally, according to data tracked by Artemis. The surge follows Tether's decision to deploy its industry-leading dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDT, on Celo in March. Since then, USDT worth over $200 million has been issued on Celo. On Wednesday, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin cheered Celo's progress on X, galvanizing investor interest in the CELO token. As of writing, the cryptocurrency traded at 63 cents, representing a nearly 20% gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk data.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows implied volatility for bitcoin options at the $100,000 strike expiring on Nov. 8 and subsequent monthly and quarterly expiries.  Options expiring on Nov. 8, are pricier compared to later dates, a sign traders anticipate significant market movement around the U.S. election results.  The U.S. elections will be held on Nov. 4 and results will be declared on Nov. 8.

In the post uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, Onchained’s analysis focused on the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Mourad Ratio, a proprietary indicator that tracks UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) held for more than six months. This ratio basically helps gauge market sentiment and accumulation trends among long-term Bitcoin holders, offering valuable insights into when BTC may enter its next bull phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Held For Years Are Now On The Move, Is This A Signal For Caution? Stability In The Long-Term Holder Mourad Ratio One of the key indicators highlighted in the analysis is the stability of the Long-Term Holder Mourad Ratio. Historically, when this ratio remains stable, it suggests that the market is not yet ready for a significant upward movement. Onchained explained that a bull market typically begins only when the ratio starts to deviate negatively from these stable levels. Currently, data shows that the LTH Mourad Ratio is steady, signaling that Bitcoin’s bull run is yet to begin. This stableness in the ratio as revealed by the analyst, indicates that long-term holders are not yet driving substantial price movement in the market, and investors may need to exercise patience until more favourable conditions arise. For further context, the Mourad Ratio is calculated by dividing the Long-Term Holder Mourad Current Transaction Value (LTH MCTV) by the current Bitcoin price. This calculation provides insight into the average value of UTXOs aged over six months, giving a clearer picture of recent accumulation trends among longer-term BTC holders. Technicals Suggests Bitcoin Bull Run Is Not So Far While Onchained analysis has confirmed that Bitcoin bull run is yet to start, other analysts has turned to historical price chart to gauge when the bull run for BTC could begin from a technical perspective. Popular Bitcoin insight platform known as Bitcoin archive on X has recently highlighted that BTC is on the verge of making a “bullish cross-over on the 5-day chart for the first time in 230 days.” Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Short Squeeze as Bitcoin Futures Market Heats Up According to Bitcoin Archive, the last two times this happened, BTC went up by 79% and 74%, therefore, should this repeat itself again, Bitcoin could surge past $100,000.

42417156,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTOlEj,1727350200,Wall Street Titan Guggenheim Tokenizes $20M of Commercial Paper on Ethereum,"Guggenheim Treasury Services and blockchain platform Zeconomy issued $20 million of tokenized commercial paper on the Ethereum blockchain.  Zeconomy CEO Giacinto Cosenza said he sees ""massive demand"" for digital assets, as demonstrated by the success of crypto ETFs.  Guggenheim Treasury Services, a subsidiary of financial services giant Guggenheim Partners, has issued $20 million of tokenized commercial paper on the Ethereum blockchain, its partner, blockchain platform Zeconomy, announced Thursday.  A spokesperson for Guggenheim confirmed the transaction took place but would not comment further.  The tokenization comes weeks after German industrial giant Siemens AG issued digital commercial paper via megabank JPMorgan’s Onyx and blockchain platform SWIAT.  Tokenization of traditional financial instruments, referred to as real-world assets (RWA), has become one of the hottest areas in crypto for TradFi firms to dabble in lately. The niche has grown to a $12 billion market capitalization, including $2 billion of tokenized U.S. government securities, according to research firm RWA.XYZ.  “With tens of billions of dollars locked in DeFi and corporate treasuries, we are thrilled to partner with GTS to address a clear need for more trusted and secure blockchain solutions,” said Giacinto Cosenza, Zeconomy's CEO, in a statement.  “As clearly demonstrated by the ETFs approval and the growth of the tokenization space, there is a massive demand for these digital assets, and we want to enable our partners so they can be at the forefront of what could be a transformative moment in the financial industry,” he said.  The commercial paper was rated P-1, the highest credit rating available for such instruments, by Moody's Investors Service.

The team said UStb can support its synthetic stablecoin USDe during tough market conditions by allowing Ethena’s governance to close USDe hedging positions and reallocate assets to UStb.  Ethena announced today that it's developing a new stablecoin called UStb, which invests its reserves in BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL).  Its the second stablecoin from Ethena, as earlier this year it launched USDe, a synthetic stablecoin that derives its value from the cash-and-carry trade, an arbitrage strategy between an asset and its derivative to maintain its $1 peg.  In a blog post, the team explained that UStb will be a ""wholly independent product"" with a different risk profile compared to USDe.  The team also wrote that UStb helps USDe manage risk during tough markets by allowing Ethena's governance to reallocate backing assets to UStb when needed.  USDe has brought about some concern from industry stakeholders who say that while the trade is safe, volatility in the markets – which crypto is known for – can quickly cause it to unwind.  In a thread on X, the team addressed some of these concerns, pointing out that while USDe has remained stable despite recent bearish conditions, it can dynamically adjust its backing between basis positions and liquid stable products and may incorporate UStb during periods of weak funding rates if needed.  Ethena said in the post that UStb will be listed on centralized exchanges like Bybit, Bitget, and any future exchanges that Ethena partners with, where USDe is already used as margin collateral.

The CELO token rallied over 20% on Wednesday.  Celo, an Ethereum layer 2 and blockchain-based ecosystem dedicated to mobile-first decentralized applications and smart contracts, is challenging Tron's position as the chain with the most daily active addresses using stablecoins.  The seven-day moving average of the daily active addresses using stablecoins on Celo has climbed to nearly 700,000, nearly matching Tron's tally, according to data tracked by Artemis.  The surge follows Tether's decision to deploy its industry-leading dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDT, on Celo in March. Since then, USDT worth over $200 million has been issued on the network.  A year ago, Celo and Opera partnered to launch MiniPay, a mobile-first non-custodial stablecoin wallet built on the Celo blockchain that facilitates the instant transfer of funds using a phone number.  ""Within less than five months of its launch, MiniPay garnered over 1 million users across Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya,"" a Celo representative told CoinDesk in an email.  On Wednesday, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin cheered Celo's progress on X, galvanizing investor interest in the CELO token. As of writing, the cryptocurrency traded at 63 cents, representing a nearly 20% gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk data.  ""Improving worldwide access to basic payments/finance has always been a key way that ethereum can be good for the world, and it's great to see @Celo getting traction,"" Buterin said on X.  Celo still lags behind Tron in terms of value of stablecoin transferred on-chain this month. Data from Artemis shows that Celo has registered just over $1 billion in the so-called transfer volume, significantly less than Tron's $335.7 billion.

Lutz said Asia is strong and that outside the U.S., India will power the industry through the next decade.  SINGAPORE —The U.S. crypto market will take a different path from the rest of the world, consolidating more with traditional finance (TradFi), because of differences in the regulatory environment and customer needs, Stephan Lutz, CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, said in an interview at Token2049 in Singapore.  ""I think that the U.S. crypto businesses will pivot in one direction that is consolidating TradFi with crypto,"" Lutz said. ""If you look at Coinbase, if you look at Circle, you look at Kraken, they are basically going more and more into becoming a digital twin of the TradFi system.""  The split, Lutz called it a bifurcation, means U.S. crypto businesses will focus on domestic customers, and companies from the rest of the world will stay out of the country. BitMEX itself does not operate there, having pleaded guilty in July to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and failing to set up an adequate know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) program between 2015 and 2020. In 2022, co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed were fined a total of $30 million for violating money-laundering rules.  Instead, BitMEX is more prominently placed in Asia, said Lutz, who was previously a partner at PwC after spending time at Deutsche Boerse, the operator of Germany's largest stock exchange.  The industry has been ""begging for issue-specific legislation in the U.S. for years,"" he said, though he's not optimistic of the chances for crypto legislation moving through the Senate before November's presidential election.  ""Market institutions in Asia will take advantage of America's confusion.""  Asia and India  Unlike the U.S. and European Union where almost everyone has access to the conventional banking system, Asia has the banked – family offices, accredited investors and wealthy corporates – alongside the so-called unbanked, who comprise more than half of the continent.  It's that group that needs alternative services such as international remittances from family members working abroad to support relatives at home, a real use case.  ""This is why you have a bifurcation of the markets. You serve completely different needs,"" Lutz said.  According to Lutz, outside of the U.S., India will power the crypto industry in the next 10 years provided the companies are reasonably open and if policymakers understand that crypto ""actually adds to their capability of maintaining"" monetary policy independence.

34005212,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644636,1727348419,"BlackRock Continues To Buy Bitcoin: Holdings Now Reach 358,000 BTC Worth $22 Billion","In less than nine months since the launch of its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) following the approval of these investment vehicles by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asset manager BlackRock has established itself as the world’s largest Bitcoin fund. A Tale Of Two Titans In Bitcoin And Ethereum Holdings According to on-chain data from blockchain analysis platform Arkham, BlackRock has aggressively expanded its Bitcoin holdings through its ETF, known as IBIT over the last months. Despite recent market volatility that saw significant dips in Bitcoin’s price on August 5 and September 6, BlackRock continued to buy more Bitcoin, thereby supporting not only the token’s value but also its own asset base. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains On Bitcoin Following Fed Rate Cut: Altseason Soon? As of September 25, BlackRock’s holdings have reached approximately 358,000 BTC, valued at around $22.76 billion, representing about 1.70% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million. In comparison, BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings exceed those of Grayscale, another major crypto asset manager in the industry, by nearly 100,000 BTC. Grayscale currently holds approximately 258,671 BTC, valued at $16.45 billion, highlighting the significant gap that BlackRock has created in the BTC investment landscape. While BlackRock has taken a commanding lead in Bitcoin, Grayscale maintains an advantage in Ethereum (ETH) holdings. Arkham’s data indicates that Grayscale possesses 2.104 million ETH, valued at roughly $5.45 billion based on the current trading price of $2,600 per ETH. In contrast, BlackRock’s Ethereum holdings amount to only 349,970 ETH, valued at approximately $910 million. BlackRock Strengthens Bitcoin Stance BlackRock’s support for Bitcoin extends beyond mere investment; it includes a strong endorsement of the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Robbie Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, challenged the prevailing notion that Bitcoin should be categorized as a “risk-on” asset. During Tuesday’s interview, Mitchnick noted that while Bitcoin has recently shown a high correlation with US equities, this relationship may be misleading. The head of digital assets at BlackRock noted that risk-on assets, such as stocks, commodities, and high-yield bonds, perform well during periods of market optimism and economic growth. Conversely, assets like gold are sought after in times of uncertainty, providing a safe haven for investors. Mitchnick drew parallels between Bitcoin and gold, saying “gold shows a lot of the same patterns”, referring to their temporary correlations with equities. He emphasized that the long-term correlation between BTC and traditional financial assets is close to zero. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Consolidates in Symmetrical Triangle – Analyst Reveals $160 Target On Breakout One of BTC’s defining characteristics is its decentralized nature, Mitchnick added. No single country or government controls it, he said, which adds to its appeal as a global monetary alternative. Mitchnick went on to highlight Bitcoin’s scarcity, global reach and decentralized framework, describing it as a “non-sovereign asset”. He pointed out that BTC has no specific country risk and no counterparty risk, making it a compelling option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has given back some of the gains made during Tuesday’s trading session, after hitting a one-month high of $64,700. Currently, BTC is trading at $63,220, down a slight 0.3% over the 24-hour period.

The memecoin has stolen the spotlight following its 117% surge throughout Q3, outperforming other well-established tokens in the sector. The feline sensation has now consolidated as the first cat-themed memecoin to hit a $1 billion market capitalization, leading the market’s bullish run alongside tokens like Sei (SEI) and Worldcoin (WLD). Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) On Track For ‘Strongest September Performance’, Is $90,000 Next? POPCAT Hits $1 Billion Market Cap Status Memecoins became the leading sector during this cycle, with many tokens outperforming most altcoins over the last few months. At the front of the frenzy, dog-themed tokens like dogwifhat (WIF) stole the spotlight during Q1 and Q2. However, a feline rival is challenging its spot as Solana’s best-performing memecoin. Investors and market watchers have praised the cat-themed sensation’s performance over the past few months. Throughout Q3’s violent market retraces, POPCAT showed a remarkable performance, becoming the largest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies several times. The memecoin’s price quickly bounced from its 55% pullbacks during the market crashes, recovering and surpassing its previous level each time. POPCAT’s price has seen a 117% surge in the past three months, driving its price from the $0.68 mark to a new all-time high (ATH). In the late hours of Tuesday, the cryptocurrency broke above the $0.97 resistance level set by its previous ATH. The memecoin continued its 21% jump towards the $1.08 level, its new ATH, before retracing to the $1.01-$1.02 price range. The surge propelled POPCAT’s market capitalization to the $1 billion mark, cementing its status as the leading cat-themed token and making it the first memecoin in this sector to achieve it. Following its remarkable rise, the token registers a 57.8% and 40.2% surge in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Its daily market activity also saw an 82% jump to a trading daily volume of $133.3 million in the last 24 hours. Investors See Further Price Potential Some crypto whales loaded their bags as POPCAT broke the $1 barrier. On Wednesday morning, on-chain data analytics firm Lookonchain revealed that a crypto investor recently repurchased the cat-themed sensation, suggesting that some investors feel positive about the token’s future performance. Per the post, the whale spent 8,644 SOL, worth around $1.29 million, to buy 1.3 million POPCAT over the past two days. The address bought 456,000 tokens on Monday before acquiring another 843,000 POPCAT when the memecoin hit $1. This whale had previously sold its POPCAT holding at a 45% loss over two months ago. The investor saw $611,000 in losses from selling its 1.69 million tokens. However, before the long-awaited surge to $1, crypto investor Trade4ddict noted that the POPCAT’s consolidation under the key resistance level was a strong sign for its potential bull continuation.

42417169,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTOlS9,1727342616,Curve Finance Mulls Removing TrueUSD as Collateral for Stablecoin Curve USD,"A new proposal on Curve Finance suggests removing TrueUSD (TUSD) as collateral for its stablecoin, crvUSD, due to concerns over TUSD's stability and regulatory issues, reducing its backing limit to zero.  The proposal also recommends decreasing the minting capacity of crvUSD with PayPal's PYUSD from $15 million to $5 million, as part of a strategy to diversify collateral and reduce reliance on potentially risky assets.  The SEC earlier charged TrueCoin, the original issuer of TUSD, with defrauding investors by not fully backing TUSD with U.S. dollars, leading to a settlement involving fines and the return of profits.  A new proposal on Curve Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) for stablecoin trading, is contemplating the removal of TrueUSD (TUSD) from its list of collateral tokens for its stablecoin, Curve USD (crvUSD).  Curve Finance is one of the largest and most used decentralized finance protocols, holdings billions of dollars in user funds. It is autonomously governed by its CRV token holders, who float and vote on proposals to keep the protocol running.  “WormholeOracle” proposed reducing the upper limit on TUSD backing for crvUSD to zero, meaning that TUSD tokens can no longer underpin crvUSD if the proposal is passed. They also recommended reducing the minting capacity of crvUSD with PayPal's stablecoin, PYUSD, from $15 million to $5 million, aiming for a more balanced reliance on different collateral assets.  “crvUSD is overexposed to minor stablecoins, especially TUSD which has a dubious track record and has recently been charged by the SEC with defrauding investors,” WormHoleOracle wrote in the proposal. “It may be prudent to consider completely removing crvUSD exposure to TUSD, which has a notably poor track record on peg stability and transparency standards compared to all other PegKeeper stablecoins.”  Currently, users can mint up to $10 million worth of crvUSD using TUSD through what's known as the 'PegKeeper' liquidity pool. A liquidity pool can be thought of as a collection of tokens stored on a smart contract.  PegKeeper debt ceiling is the max amount of crvUSD that a PegKeeper can mint to a target crvUSD pool. Historically, the USDC/USDT pools have been the primary liquidity centers and most useful PegKeeper pools for keeping crvUSD pegged to its intended U.S. dollar-backed - ensuring crvUSD is equal to $1 at all times.  The move is part of a broader strategy to diversify and ensure the stability of crvUSD by reducing reliance on any single asset, or group of assets, that are deemed risky.  It comes after regulatory concerns and legal challenges faced by TrueCoin, the original issuer of TUSD before it ended up in the hands of offshore firm Techteryx.  TrueCoin was earlier accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of engaging in unregistered offers and sales of securities involving TUSD through TrueFi, a stablecoin platform, and the agency said they remained closely tied to the asset after unloading the stablecoin to the other issuer.  The SEC alleged that TUSD was not fully backed by U.S. dollars as claimed, but instead, a significant portion of its reserves (allegedly 99%) was invested in a speculative offshore fund.  Earlier this week, the companies agreed to pay $163,766 each in fines, and TrueCoin will return nearly $400,000 in profits and interest, assuming a federal court approves the settlement.",NEGATIVE,TUSD,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION | TUSD,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/26/curve-finance-mulls-removing-trueusd-as-collateral-for-stablecoin-curve-usd,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de31c185aa16c4ba1606d395883d5ef7ebc16e7d-3333x1875.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34001259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644649,1727339410,Bitcoin Price Forecast: Decisive 24 Hours Ahead With Crucial Support And Resistance Levels,"According to technical analyst InspoCrypto, the current state of the Bitcoin (BTC) market reflects mixed sentiment and potential for volatility, particularly as the Bitcoin price hovers between $63,000 and the $64,000 mark. Bitcoin Price Analysis InspoCrypto’s analysis indicates that the maximum slippage recorded was 16.5, which points to moderate liquidity in the market. A volume delta of 415.848 million suggests a cumulative imbalance between buy and sell orders, with increased buying pressure supporting the recent price rise. This indicates that liquidity is sufficient to prevent sudden price shocks. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Consolidates in Symmetrical Triangle – Analyst Reveals $160 Target On Breakout Hyblock Capital’s heatmap analysis reveals critical liquidation levels based on traders’ leverage positions. Notably, substantial liquidity exists around the $60,000 and $64,000 zones, indicating potential resistance just above the $64,500 mark due to a heavy cluster of short liquidations. Conversely, long liquidations are concentrated around $61,000, which could serve as a significant support level for the Bitcoin price. A breach of $64,000 may trigger short liquidations, potentially driving prices higher, while a drop below $61,000 could lead to cascading long liquidations. Examining the distribution of open interest (OI), significant concentrations are found in the $64,200 to $64,400 range. This suggests strong trader positioning, indicating that a substantial move away from this zone could lead to increased volatility. Additionally, the funding rate stands at -12.678%, indicating a dominant short position in the market, with shorts effectively paying to maintain their positions. Whales Favor Long Positions The current bid-ask ratio is at 38.618%, reflecting a slightly ask-heavy market, which indicates that selling pressure outweighs buying demand. This sentiment is further supported by the average leverage delta, which is at -6.67, showing that short traders are using more leverage than longs, reinforcing a bearish outlook. However, the volume delta is positive at 4.60 million, indicating a net buying imbalance that could support upward momentum. The Whale vs. Retail Delta stands at 56.681%, suggesting that whales are slightly longer compared to retail traders. This minor bullish sentiment from larger players could influence market dynamics as whales typically have a greater market impact. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Spend $185 Million To Accumulate 70,000 ETH, Time To Buy? Overall, the analyst contends that the Bitcoin price is exhibiting mixed signals. The negative funding rate and higher short leverage indicate a potential downward move, but significant open interest and positive volume delta suggest that a breakout in either direction could be imminent. InspoCrypto suggests that in the next 24 hours, traders should prepare for volatility, particularly if liquidation zones around $61,000 or $64,500 are triggered. By the end of the week, it is expected that the Bitcoin price could either break resistance near $64,500 or test support at $61,000. If funding rates shift to positive, further upward momentum may follow. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $63,370, recording minor losses of 0.3% compared to Tuesday’s trading session.

42417168,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTOlR7,1727338207,Crypto Inspired by 'Moo Deng' Zooms to $100M as Hippo Meme Takes Over Internet,"Moo Deng, a baby pygmy hippo, has become an internet sensation, leading to the creation of a Solana-based memecoin that has surpassed a $100 million market cap.  One trader notably turned $1,331 into $3.4 million by investing in the Moo Deng memecoin.  Her appeal has transcended individual internet users to encompass corporations including Dreamworks and UFC, which are creating memes based on the hippo.  Moo Deng, a newborn Thai hippo at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Bangkok, has captured the hearts of many online through her cute antics. Now, she's the star of a $100 million memecoin.  The Solana token crossed the milestone capitalization earlier Thursday, becoming one of the few to reach that level from zero in recent months, CoinMarketCap data shows.  It's also the first Thai-themed token to hit that market cap, though it's not a Thai project per se, according to Udomsak Rakwongwan, a professor at Kasetsart University and co-founder of decentralized exchange FWX.Finance.  ""There used to be other memes in Thailand, but they were not so successful because they began in Thailand,"" he said. ""There was a token about ex-junta prime minister. It went quite viral, but the price and market caps didn't go anywhere.""  ""Moodeng is a little different,"" because the hippo has been on major global media and appeals to a global audience rather than a token about a politician that only Thais would know.  Holder count has zoomed to 12,400 unique wallets, with over $48.5 million in volume traded over the last 24 hours, a fan page for the token said Wednesday.  One trader made millions from the hippo heartthrob, with on-chain data from Lookonchain showing a wallet that turned $1,331 into $3.4 million by correctly timing the market.  Moo Deng – which means bouncy pork in Thai – was born in July and became a popular Internet meme earlier this month after images of her went viral online. She has two siblings, brother Moo Toon (stewed pork) and sister Moo Waan (sweet pork). They also birthed tokens on Solana and other networks, but failed to catch the traction that Moo Deng did.  Companies including Dreamworks and UFC are using Moo Deng’s popularity to produce memes based on the hippo, a shift away from the usual cats or dogs.  The Bangkok zoo is reportedly working on copyrighting and trademarking ""Moo Deng the hippo"" for fundraising purposes. So far, it hasn’t acknowledged the memecoin or any crypto-related Moo Deng imagery.  Meanwhile, some see the token as a fresh, engaging memecoin with genuine appeal due to its cute and interesting theme.  “I believe Moodeng is EXACTLY what meme coins should be like,” X user and crypto trader @0xuberM said. “Something genuinely cute/interesting with crazy normie appeal that will capture enough attention over a sustained period of time to guarantee PVE expansion where everyone eats.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | ZRX,"Shaurya Malwa, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/26/crypto-inspired-by-moo-deng-zooms-to-100m-as-hippo-meme-takes-over-internet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c7c7d81dfdcba0921a0520530039feea13ecda9-1261x635.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417174,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTOlYL,1727336430,Key Indicators Challenge Fed's 'Normalization' Rate Cut That Torched Bitcoin Rally,"The post-Fed risk-on rally supports the normalization narrative.  Some indicators, like the unemployment rate, the ratio between leading and lagging economic indicators, and the gold-oil ratio, disagree, pointing to an impending slowdown.  Since the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) cut rates by 50 basis points a week ago, the debate has been raging on whether the so-called easing represents the normalization of an overly tight monetary policy aimed at taming inflation or preparation for an impending economic swoon.  Risk assets, including pure fiat liquidity plays like bitcoin {{BTC}} and altcoins, have rallied since the Fed decision, a sign that markets perceive the rate cut as a normalization move. Some analysts foresee accelerated gains once bitcoin surpasses the $65,200 resistance.  However, at least three indicators point to an economic malaise ahead, suggesting caution on the part of the bulls. Perhaps, the Fed delivered an outsized rate cut, taking note of these forward-looking indicators.  Rising joblessness  The U.S. Household Survey, which tracks the unemployment rate across 50 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico, showed that as of August, more than 57% of states experienced an increase in joblessness compared to the preceding month and the same period last year, according to data tracked by MacroMicro.  The fact that most states are witnessing an uptick in the unemployment rate means the risk of reduced income, consumer spending and investment, and a decline in business and consumer confidence in the months ahead, potentially leading to a marked economic slowdown, if not an outright recession (consecutive quarters of economic contraction). A slowdown could see investors scale back exposure to riskier investments.  ""According to August's analysis, 57.7% of U.S. states reported higher unemployment rates than the previous month and year. This points to increasing challenges in the labor market, possibly signaling a more widespread slowdown,"" MacroMicro said on X.  Lead/lag ratio  Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) fell to 100.2 in August, falling to its lowest since October 2016. The index marked its sixth consecutive monthly decline, triggering a recession signal.  The LEI comprises several forward-looking indicators such as average weekly hours in manufacturing, average weekly initial claims for jobless insurance, ISM new orders index, stock prices and leading credit index. The index is widely tracked to identify shifts in economic trends and turning points in asset prices.  More concerning is the slide in the ratio between leading and lagging indicators to under 0.85, the lowest since at least the 1950s, according to data tracked by Jeff Weniger, head of equities at WisdomTree.  The plunge seen over the past several months points to a potential slowdown or recession, with lagging indicators catching up to the economic reality.  The ratio has seen eight similar meltdowns in the past, each portending a recession.  Surging gold/brent ratio  The ratio between prices for gold futures and brent crude futures has surged over 35% this year to nearly 40 points, the highest since 2020, according to data source MacroMicro.  Gold is a safe haven asset and an inflation hedge, while oil is tied to global demand and economic activity. Therefore, gold's prolonged outperformance relative to oil is often taken to represent a sign of economic slowdown.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/26/key-indicators-challenge-feds-normalization-rate-cut-that-torched-bitcoin-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7c5610c2812bd5d3dba3734d262fdfe5f5058ed-1433x806.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.1090 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another increase if it clears the $0.1100 and $0.1120 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes Upside Break Dogecoin price extended its increase above the $0.1100 resistance zone. It even spiked above $0.1110 before the bears appeared. DOGE started a downside correction from the $0.1111 high like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.1100 and $0.1095 levels. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1037 swing low to the $0.1111 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.1090 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. However, the bulls were active near $0.1075. They protected the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1037 swing low to the $0.1111 high. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.1080 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1095 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1120 level. A close above the $0.1120 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1132 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1150 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1200. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1095 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1080 level. The next major support is near the $0.1065 level. The main support sits at $0.1050. If there is a downside break below the $0.1050 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1000 level or even $0.0950 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1065 and $0.1050.

China is reportedly considering a substantial 1 trillion yuan capital injection into its major state banks to bolster the economy, following the People's Bank of China's decision to cut the reserve requirement ratio and lower the repo rate.  Ether traded above $2,500 with a weekly increase, despite a small daily drop, with its ETFs also showing positive inflows. Meanwhile, WorldCoin’s WLD tokens surged by 14% following expansion announcements and developments at OpenAI.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} traded above $63,000 for the first half of the Asian trading hours on Thursday, down 1.4%, but up 2% on-week as inflows into BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain positive.  Asian stocks surged higher amid reports that China is considering injecting up to 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) of capital into its biggest state banks to increase their capacity to support the struggling economy.  This follows an easing decision from earlier in the week that saw The People's Bank of China (PBOC) cutting the reserve requirement ratio for mainland banks by 50 basis points (bps) while also lowering the seven-day reverse repo rate – the interest rate at which a central bank borrows funds from commercial banks – by 20 bps to 1.5%.  Data from SoSoValue shows that the total daily net inflow cracked $100 million for the second day in a row for the BTC ETFs. This marks a five-day streak of positive net inflow for the funds.  That has flipped an indicator tracking 30-day net holdings among ETFs to positive for the first time in September, data from CryptoQuant shows, suggesting a rising trend of accumulation as opposed to sales.  Meanwhile, ether {{ETH}} is trading above $2,500, down 1.3% on-day and up 8% for the week. Data shows that spot ETH ETFs had daily net inflow of $43 million, marking a second day of positive net inflow.  In a recent note, Presto Research wrote that rising Ethereum gas fees, driven by an increase in network transactions, have coincided with ETH outperforming BTC following the Fed's 50 basis points rate cut.  While on-chain yields remain below the three-month treasury bill, some investors are positioning for a potential recovery in total value locked (TVL), Presto Write. However, a broader capital migration may not happen until 2025.  Sam Altman-backed WorldCoin’s WLD jumped 14% in the past 24 hours to become one of the only gainers in the broader crypto market. The company on Wednesday said it had begun its verification services in Poland, Malaysia and Guatemala over the past week - onboarding more users and boosting the project's fundamentals.  The rise came amid an executive shuffle at OpenAI - another Altman company - and a switch in the company’s status from a nonprofit to a for-profit benefit corporation.

33996547,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644609,1727328616,"Ethereum Demand Driven By Use In On-Chain Applications, Token Transfers: CoinShares","Ethereum (ETH) demand is largely driven by the token’s use in on-chain applications and token transfers, according to a report by CoinShares. Ethereum’s Use-Cases Have Increased, But Long-Term Value Is Missing In a recently published detailed report, CoinShares’ Matthew Kimmell noted that despite Ethereum’s potential to host popular applications in the future, investors are struggling to see a significant value proposition in its native ETH token. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs See Largest Outflows Since July: Is Waning Institutional Demand Hurting ETH? Since its inception in July 2015, Ethereum has made big strides as it has continually witnessed the emergence of new use-cases, starting from simple token transfers, to use in on-chain applications, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and, most recently, non-fungible tokens (NFTs). According to the report, Ethereum began to see broader utility from 2018 onwards, when its major use shifted from token transfers to simple on-chain applications, digital identity systems, and on-chain withdrawals. From 2020 onwards, Ethereum has facilitated more complex use-cases such as protocol staking, liquidity mining, MEV (maximum extractable value), bridges, oracles, and second-layer technologies. Although the increasing use-cases might sound favorable for Ethereum at the surface level, the challenge lies in ETH usage being concentrated among a limited range of services. The report reads: However, the hard truth is that a very small set of services consistently makes up the majority of Ethereum usage, and these sets largely revolve around speculation or simple value transfer, not necessarily the type of complex “real-world utility” use cases originally envisioned by the developers of the Ethereum Foundation. The chart below confirms this observation, showing that simple token transfers and application interactions comprise the bulk of ETH usage, followed by infrastructure, intermediary operations, and contract management. Marketplaces Dominate Application Usage, Stablecoins Lead Token Transfers The report highlights that on-chain marketplaces – especially decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like Uniswap – dominate application interactions. Notably, over 90% of transaction fees originate from marketplace activity. In the first half of 2024, Uniswap alone captured about 15% of Ethereum transaction fees. This is not surprising, as the leading DEX recently achieved the milestone of generating $50 million in revenue. On the contrary, NFT trading platforms have suffered a dramatic decline in user transactions since their peak in 2021. Token transfers continue to play a key role in the Ethereum network activity. With the constantly expanding ecosystem, the type of tokens being transferred has diversified. However, ETH, and stablecoins such as USDT and USDC have emerged as the dominant tokens in terms of transaction fees. The chart below illustrates the rise of stablecoins from mid-2017, when USDT began to see high adoption as a trading pair for almost all listed ERC-20 tokens on crypto exchanges. Circle’s entry into the market in late 2020 with its USDC stablecoin further boosted stablecoin usage within the wider Ethereum ecosystem. An interesting observation made in the report is regarding the increased use of Ethereum layer-2 solutions. While their adoption has tackled some of Ethereum’s scalability issues, they have also, unintentionally reduced demand for Ethereum’s base layer. Kimmel notes: In our view, the latest major change, EIP-4844, which strongly incentivized Layer 2s, has worked directly against the economic design benefits of EIP-1559, which tied the value of ether to its Layer 1 platform demand.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.5850 and $0.5880 resistance levels. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $0.600 resistance zone. The price started a downside correction and traded below the $0.5880 support like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $0.580 level and the price tested $0.5750. A low was formed at $0.5744 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $0.5780 and $0.580 levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5953 swing high to the $0.5744 low. The price is now trading below $0.590 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5850 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.5880 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5953 swing high to the $0.5744 low. The next key resistance could be $0.5920. A clear move above the $0.5920 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5950 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.600 resistance or even $0.6050 in the near term. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5850 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5765 level. The next major support is near the $0.5750 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5750 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5640 support in the near term.

The Indian cryptocurrency exchange lost $234 million, some 45% of customers' funds, in a hack in July.  A Singapore court has granted Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX a four-month moratorium based on certain conditions on Thursday, the company said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.  The conditions imposed on WazirX include revealing the addresses of its Wallets through a court affidavit, responding to users' queries, revealing its book of accounts within six weeks, and ensuring that any future voting on the way ahead is conducted on an independent platform.  WazirX, which lost $234 million in a hack, some 45% of customers' funds, had filed an application with the Singapore High Court for a six-month moratorium.  The hacker behind that July hack has nearly finished laundering the stolen funds, using Tornado Cash to obscure the transactions.  Earlier, the crypto exchange's legal advisers said WazirX customers are unlikely to be made whole in crypto terms.  The Judge in the case heard the matter on Wednesday, and on Thursday, she delivered a verdict.  During the proceedings on Wednesday, she asked the legal representatives of WazirX to ""think about"" releasing the details of any assets the exchange had other than the tokens it held.  The Judge said the exchange acted on ""good faith"" by stepping up and seeking a moratorium, according to an industry source.  ""Our immediate filing for the moratorium was a decisive step taken to ensure the fastest, fairest, creditor-approved, legally binding path to resolution where creditors have a token choice and potential upside in a bull run,"" said Nischal Shetty, Founder of WazirX in a statement.

NY's BitLicense has evolved and has been used as inspiration for other regulatory regimes around the world like Singapore and the EU, the superintendent said.  NEW YORK — New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris said federal legislation addressing cryptocurrencies would be welcome, but maintained that states should keep their existing roles overseeing digital assets.  States have been able to move more quickly while conventional wisdom that allowing states to regulate digital assets may create a ""race to the bottom"" in terms of regulatory oversight hasn't been borne out, Harris said at the Digital Asset Compliance and Market Integrity Summit in midtown Manhattan Wednesday.  ""We are maybe more eager than anyone to have a federal partner and to see federal legislation and regulation,"" Harris said. ""I think it's really important that legislation gets passed, regulations get written, but it is still important that there is a role for the states.""  Harris said she was ""optimistic"" that the House and Senate might move legislation soon, saying NYDFS has spoken to both parties in both houses of the legislature over the past few years.  BitLicense evolution  New York's BitLicense, which is nearly a decade old, has evolved over the years but the regulator's view of it has stayed the same, Harris said.  ""I think our approach hasn't evolved that much. The approach was always about, how do you sort of square these competing objectives of fostering innovation, but protecting consumers and markets,"" she said. ""And so that means you really have to stay abreast of developments in industry, but also be the cop on the beat and strike that balance.""  NYDFS has one of the world's largest crypto units, Harris said, with 60 full-time staffers dedicated to the crypto sector.  Harris said the general public's views on the BitLicense have similarly become more accepting since its introduction, a change she called ""gratifying."" Even federal lawmakers have pointed to the BitLicense as an example.  ""[That's] not to say that it's perfect, right? There are some really valid critiques, both in terms of the rule and the way it has been operationalized,"" she said.

However, the meme coin’s fundamentals remain concerning as they paint a bearish picture for SHIB. Shiba Inu Set For A Historic Run In October Shiba Inu is set to enjoy a parabolic rally in October if history were to repeat itself. Data from CryptoRank shows that the meme coin has always enjoyed monthly positive returns in October. During the 2021 bull run, SHIB’s price skyrocketed by 833% in October of that year, while it enjoyed modest gains of 10% and 6% in October 2022 and 2023, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Remains Bullish: Crypto Experts Unveil Predictions For The Price Therefore, Shiba Inu could record significant gains this October. Moreover, the outlook for the broader crypto market in October is also bullish. For instance, Bitcoin has historically enjoyed its highest returns between October and December. The flagship crypto is again expected to enjoy a price rally starting in October. As such, Shiba Inu’s price will also rally as Bitcoin enjoys an upward trend. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that SHIB’s price correlation with BTC is currently at 0.89, which indicates a strong positive price correlation between both assets. This proves that the meme coin will rally as Bitcoin moves to the upside. Shiba Inu investors are already preparing for the historic run as data from the on-chain analytics platform Cryptoquant shows that they have accumulated 770 billion SHIB between September 23 and 24. This figure represents the outflows that left exchanges in these two days. Moving coins off exchanges indicates that these investors intend to hold for the long term. This accumulation trend among these investors could also contribute to the price surge that Shiba Inu could enjoy in October. Fundamentals Remain A Concern Shiba Inu’s fundamentals are a concern, as they paint a bearish picture for the meme coin. Data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker Shibburn shows that the coin’s burn rate has dropped over 90% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, there has also been a 61% drop in the number of tokens burnt in the last seven days. The lack of network activity on Shibarium is another bearish fundamental. Data from the Shibarium explorer shows that daily transactions on the layer-2 network remain stagnant and below 10,000. A recent high was the 11,360 transactions witnessed on September 19. However, the following day, daily transactions dropped to 8,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Symmetrical Triangle Pattern Reappears, Why A 200% Rally Is Possible The low activity on Shibarium has also contributed to the drop in Shiba Inu’s burn rate. Base transaction fees on Shibarium are usually converted to SHIB and burnt. However, with such low interest in the layer-2 network, there is a limit to how many SHIB tokens can be burnt. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.000014, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

BCHG's NAV premium remains high at over 100%, making it akin to paying $2 for $1, which I find unjustified. Grayscale's private placements have increased BCHG shares by 23% YTD, with restricted shares unlocking in February 2025, potentially normalizing the premium. Growing short positions in BCHG indicate bearish sentiment; I recommend direct BCH allocation over BCHG due to high premiums and upcoming share unlocks. I'll get the mea culpa out of the way before we get into updated data for the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust ( BCHG ). In early December 2023 , I called the then 43% premium to NAV the market was assigning BCHG shares overvalued and unwarranted. I even posited that it made more sense to fade BCHG and long the coin more directly if investors were truly bullish Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ). Performance 12/5/23 - 9/24/24 (Seeking Alpha) Not only have I been dead wrong about BCHG's inflated premium since that December article, but BCHG has outperformed both BCH and the S&P since that time. Between December and early April, the market took the BCHG NAV rate premium from slightly over 40% to just under 300% at the peak. Performance 3/6/24 - 9/24/24 (Seeking Alpha) However, I'll also note that since reiterating my caution on the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust in early-March, we do indeed see BCHG slightly below that second 'hold' call dating back to last year. But I'll own it again; there was a rocket ride up to $23 per share for BCHG in-between my March article and today. Thus, I'm still considering that call a major miss. Furthermore, BCH has under-performed BCHG since the March article and now trails even the index as well. But like any glutton for punishment, I'm back with a third attempt at proclaiming BCHG overvalued at the current market price. Though now, I suspect longs are running out of time to capture what is left of the fund's juicy premium. Current NAV Premium BCHG Premium Rate History (CoinGlass) There is no question the price of BCHG shares has been volatile over the last 12 months. That volatility has allowed the fund to trade at a massive premium to NAV. While that premium has come down considerably in the last five months, I'd argue it's still way too high at current levels. At a closing price of $6.31 per share on 9/24 against a NAV of $2.94, BCHG shares continue to trade at more than double the underlying value of the fund. I'll reiterate once again that buying BCHG at the most recent closing price is no different from paying $2 to buy $1. Doing so is justified with the assumption that someone else will pay more than $2 for a $1 or that the $1 in the fund will double in value. You could talk me into the latter happening. The former is likely more dubious given the share supply that I expect to come to market in Q1 next year. Private Placements Earlier this year, Grayscale reopened private placements in nearly every single-asset fund that the company offers. To explain this as simply and easily as I can, Grayscale's non-ETF products are closed end funds. During times of NAV rate discounts, there is very little recourse for shareholders to close the rate to 'fair value' if sellers are more motivated than buyers. However, when the funds trade at large, sustained premiums to NAV, Grayscale allows accredited investors to buy BCH at NAV and place the newly purchased crypto into the Bitcoin Cash Trust in exchange for newly issued shares. In doing this, private placers have an immediate paper gain on the investment, provided the fund shares continue to trade at a NAV rate premium in the secondary market. The catch is private placers must wait out a 12-month share lockup before they can capture the premium by selling new shares via OTC secondary. Grayscale BCH Holdings (Coinglass) Since private placements were reopened for BCHG in Q1 of this year, we've seen approximately 64k BCH come into the fund from a starting level of roughly 300k BCH in mid-February. Shares outstanding have grown from 34.8 million at the end of 2023 to 42.8 million as of September 24th. Thus, shares in the fund have grown by roughly 23% year to date. This is certainly not the worst private placement pile-on from accredited investors that can currently be observed in the Grayscale single-asset altcoin funds. But given BCHG is Grayscale's 2nd largest single-asset product of this type by AUM, I suspect BCHG will be one of the first Grayscale funds to normalize when restricted shares start coming out of lock in February 2025. Shares Sold Short Perhaps adding credence to that theory is the growing position in BCHG shares sold short according to OTC data. BCHG Short Position (OTC, Grayscale, Author's Chart) Going back to the beginning of May, we've seen shares sold short as a percent of shares outstanding more than double, from about 3% to nearly 8%. To be clear, I would not personally advocate for shorting Grayscale funds due to the fact that premium rates can move so high, and the underlying assets can also move up in price very quickly. I wouldn't say that I'm seeing justification for an explosive move in BCH given the on-chain data that I follow, but in a rate cut environment with expectations for growth in global liquidity, anything can happen. But I do think the increase in short selling is a signal that BCHG holders shouldn't ignore. Final Takeaways In closing, value is certainly subjective. Just because I think a 100% premium to NAV is silly, it doesn't mean the market has to agree with me. In fact, the market has shown over the last 9 months that it doesn't agree with me. Regardless, I'm going to remain stubborn on this 'hold' call because I see unlocks on the horizon. I see bearish bets getting more aggressive. And I see this happening in a fund that is one of Grayscale's more liquid of its single-asset altcoin product offerings. I have no beef with Bitcoin Cash. I actually hold some in a crypto IRA. And I think that's the biggest issue I've had with the high premiums for these funds in this cycle. There are numerous other ways to get tax-advantaged exposure to altcoins compared to the last bull cycle. Grayscale was largely the only game in town during the 2020/2021 run. That's not the case today. From here, I see BCHG rallying to higher prices longer term, only if it gets dragged up by BCH. Thus, given the premium, I say direct BCH allocation is the better way to express that idea. In five months, BCHG share supply is coming to market. And it sure looks to me like the shorts are already sniffing that out.",NEUTRAL,BCH,ALTCOIN | BCH | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4723344-bchg-grayscale-bitcoin-cash-trust-five-more-months-until-unlocks-begin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33993797.jpeg

Claims that crypto mining devices constitute securities are incorrect, and are based on a misinterpretation of court documents.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Green United can proceed to trial, a Utah judge ruled Monday.  Last March, the SEC accused the Utah-based operation of scamming investors out of $18 million by selling them phony crypto mining equipment via a multi-level marketing scheme in which the company’s affiliates received a portion of the proceeds from each of the $3,000 “Green Boxes” they sold.  According to the SEC’s complaint, investors were told that the so-called Green Boxes were specialized crypto miners that mined GREEN tokens on the Green Blockchain – which they allegedly claimed supported a “public global decentralized power grid” – and could generate 40% to 50% monthly returns. Investors never physically received their equipment, and were told that the machines would be remotely hosted at a Green United-controlled data center.  In reality, the Green Blockchain didn’t exist, but the Green Boxes did – sort of.  Green United’s founder, Will Thurston (who, along with promoter Kristoffer Krohn, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit), allegedly used the money investors gave him for the phony Green Boxes and used it to buy S9 Antminers – commercially-available bitcoin mining machines – which he then used to mine bitcoin for himself. According to the SEC, investors didn’t see any of the actual bitcoin {{BTC}} their purchases mined, but instead received periodic distributions of worthless GREEN tokens created by Thurston on the Ethereum blockchain.  Though Green United’s lawyers attempted to have the case dismissed, U.S. District Court Judge Ann Marie McIff Allen ruled that the SEC has “sufficiently alleged a security in the form of Green Boxes” to allow the case to proceed to trial, as well as its allegations of fraud.  The ruling caused something of a stir in online crypto circles, with at least one large X account claiming (in a since-deleted post) that the “SEC says crypto mining devices are securities.”  “This is wrong. Remain calm,” responded Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications at crypto lobbying group Coin Center. “This has no bearing on managed crypto mining. It’s garden variety ‘cloud mining’ scamming.”  The judge’s Monday ruling makes no mention of the real S9 Antminers – or bitcoin – Green United was allegedly buying with investor funds.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/26/utah-judge-rules-secs-case-against-alleged-crypto-mining-scam-green-united-can-proceed-to-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c41a0231d78933b542741460696230f0d9d80a7-4802x2701.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC is still above the $62,500 support and might aim for a fresh increase. Bitcoin is consolidating gains below the $63,800 resistance zone. The price is trading below $63,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $63,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if there is a clear move above the $63,700 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Revisits $62,500 Bitcoin price started a downside correction after it failed to clear the $64,750 zone. BTC dipped below the $64,000 and $63,500 support levels. There was also a spike below $63,000. A low was formed at $63,673 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a move above the $63,000 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $64,770 swing high to the $62,673 low. Bitcoin is now trading below $63,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $63,250 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $63,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $63,700 level. A clear move above the $63,700 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $64,000 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $64,770 swing high to the $62,673 low. A close above the $64,000 resistance might spark more upsides. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $64,750 resistance level. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $63,700 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $63,000 level. The first major support is near the $62,500 level. The next support is now near the $62,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $61,200 support in the near term.

33991721,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644608,1727317819,Ethereum’s Futures Market Points To Potential Breakout—Here’s What You Need To Know,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is signaling a potential price recovery based on recent data from its perpetual futures market. According to a CryptoQuant analyst named Shayan, Ethereum’s futures market has noticed a notable shift that could indicate an upcoming price surge. The key to this analysis lies in the 30-day moving average of Ethereum’s funding rates, which has started to show a slight bullish trend after a period of decline. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Poised for a Comeback: Can It Break $2,700? Futures Market Suggests Ethereum’s Price Breakout Is Near The funding rate in perpetual futures contracts is a crucial indicator that helps identify whether market participants are predominantly buying or selling Ethereum. A positive funding rate signals more aggressive buying activity, whereas a negative rate suggests that sellers are in control. Shayan notes that Ethereum’s funding rates have recently experienced an uptick, reflecting an increase in buyer activity, which has coincided with a broader market rebound. This development suggests that the market sentiment toward Ethereum may shift toward a more bullish outlook, potentially setting the stage for further price increases. Shayan noted: Recently, the 30-day moving average of ETH funding rates has shown a slight bullish shift after a prolonged period of decline. This shift has coincided with a broader market rebound and an uptick in Ethereum’s price, suggesting a possible change in market sentiment. Shayan highlights this change as an early indication of a potential price recovery for Ethereum. According to the analyst, for Ethereum to maintain its upward momentum, the funding rates will need to stay in positive territory, reflecting sustained demand in the futures market. However, should funding rates reverse and turn negative again, this could signal a pause or even a reversal in Ethereum’s price growth. Ethereum Market Performance So far, Ethereum has struggled to make any further significant move since it recently reclaimed the $2,600 mark. Although the asset has fallen below this price mark today, ETH has increased by more than 10% in the past week. With its current market performance now trading for $2,589, at the time of writing, it is evident that Ethereum is yet to reflect the bullish momentum suggested by its perpetual market. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains On Bitcoin Following Fed Rate Cut: Altseason Soon? Regardless, given that ETH has broken above the $2,100, analysts such as Crypto Patel have suggested further upward move for the asset.

Following the recent decision by the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 0.50% on September 18, the cryptocurrency market has seen a resurgence in investor confidence, leading to notable price increases for SOL. In light of these developments, asset management firm VanEck, through its research arm MarketVector, has released compelling predictions regarding Solana’s future. The report highlights Solana’s technological advancements and raises questions about its current market positioning compared to Ethereum (ETH). Solana Market Cap Could Hit $157 Billion VanEck’s analysis reveals significant differences between Solana and Ethereum, particularly in performance metrics. Solana processes 3,000% more transactions than Ethereum, has 1,300% more daily active users, and offers transaction fees that are nearly 5 million percent lower. However, despite Solana’s superior performance, its market capitalization is only 22% of Ethereum’s, which currently stands at $314 billion. This disparity is even more pronounced when considering the combined activity of Ethereum and its Layer 2 (L2) solutions, which often enhance transactional capabilities.

Based on the report, there is growing optimism that Solana could reach 50% of Ethereum’s market cap, which would mean a jump from the current market cap of $71 billion to $157 billion for the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. In addition, the research notes that the SOL price could reach a mark of $330, representing a rise of nearly 120% for the cryptocurrency. This could represent a potential top for this market cycle and a new all-time high for the token, a far cry from the current record high of $259 in the 2021 bull run. VanEck Warns Of Missing Out On SOL Opportunities The report also notes that the roles of decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, and payments are critical drivers of adoption for both Ethereum and Solana. Lending and borrowing in the DeFi space are projected to grow rapidly. At the same time, Solana’s cheaper fees and faster transaction times present a strong case for its adoption in payments and remittances. The asset manager believes that if institutions and everyday users can benefit from low-cost transactions, Solana’s user base could grow significantly, further strengthening its ecosystem and usage.

However, the report argues that while retail investors are beginning to recognize the benefits of Solana, institutional adoption has been slower. Factors contributing to this include Ethereum’s first-mover advantage, greater institutional familiarity and a general reluctance to shift significant capital from well-established assets such as ETH. Still, VanEck points out that institutions that “overlook undervalued assets” such as Solana, risk missing out on significant opportunities. The firm concludes that holding on to established assets without considering emerging competitors can be dangerous in cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $152, up 3.3% and nearly 20% over the 24-hour and seven-day periods, respectively.
