Boost VC’s Tribe 5 began its three-month startup accelerator yesterday, as reported by Upstart Business Journal. According to Draper, the firm remains bullish on bitcoin and has no plans to stop investing in new startups and ideas.  ""While some people might have backed off of bitcoin a little bit, we doubled down,"" Draper told the publication. ""We just invested in twice as many companies as anyone has ever invested in bitcoin. We broke our own record.""  Draper added that he intends to grow the amount of companies in Boost VC's portfolio to as many as 100 by 2017.  Despite bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations, Boost VC continues to be extremely confident in the space and assertive with its investments.  Last month Draper revealed in the company’s ""biggest announcement ever"" that following new funding, it would provide each of Tribe 5’s graduating companies with 300 BTC in addition to the initial $10,000–$20,000 in capital that the companies receive upon admission to the accelerator.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TRADING,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/03/boost-vc-enlists-24-bitcoin-startups-for-tribe-5,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eae711c98ef77e7e0c12b8fdd4e0e7113051e58-1455x556.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398213,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSnbz,1423001780,Isle of Man eBusiness Chief: Bitcoin Legislation Coming This Year,"The story of bitcoin on the Isle of Man has been one of fits and starts.  Bursting onto the scene as a favorable jurisdiction for bitcoin at a time when global regulators were largely taking a reactionary approach to the digital currency, the self-governing British crown dependency won quick acclaim from prominent members of the ecosystem.  By September, however, doubt was cast on the viability of its initiatives when key banking channels available to startups were abruptly severed during a high-profile conference.  Undeterred, the Isle of Man is seeking once again to make the case that it can provide a safe haven for digital currency projects, and in the process, spur the kind of economic boom it saw arise from its early embrace of online gambling and electronic gaming.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Brian Donegan, the Isle of Man’s head of operations for digital development and e-business, asserted that the government is still moving aggressively to put key measures in place that would help the region's budding digital currency industry thrive.  Donegan said:  “The Proceeds of Crime Act, an existing piece of legislation from 2008, is being amended to embrace bitcoin and digital currencies generally. That proposal is in hand as we speak and due to be laid in front of our parliament for approval later on this year.”  While unable to provide an exact date as to when the regulation would be enacted, Donegan voiced his optimism that it would be more likely “earlier on than later”.  Interpretations of how bitcoin could be addressed by the Financial Services Act of 2008 first surfaced in July. At the time, the island’s Financial Supervision Commission (FSC) noted it would seek to amend schedule 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Act in a bid to bring such businesses under anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) law.  Economic incentive  To Donegan, the Isle of Man’s embrace of bitcoin is part of a long-term trend that has found it seeking to diversify its reliance on banking and insurance companies.  Research from Ernst & Young indicates that e-gaming, for example, accounted for 8% of the national income on the Isle of Man in 2010, providing nearly 700 jobs at that time. The Isle of Man was early to embrace the e-gaming industry, enacting specific regulation in 2001 that it believes proved integral to helping the industry grow to $20bn in annual revenue.  As such, Donegan sees a big opportunity in helping the bitcoin industry achieve similar growth, given the unique combination of resources it offers.  “We need the tech platform in terms of the telecoms interconnectivity, we need the bandwidth and the data centers, and we have those in spades,” he said, referencing strengths listed in the island’s published materials.  Donegan further cited the developing relationship between the bitcoin and e-gaming sectors as yet another reason courting the bitcoin industry is smart business.  To date, there have been a number of bitcoin companies and projects that have sought to strike e-gaming partnerships, including most notably bitcoin processor GoCoin.  Banking services need regulation  Such a future, however, won’t be possible unless the Isle of Man can encourage UK banks to engage again with startups on the island.  Donegan indicated that while such relationships were discontinued as a result of a “combination of factors”, the island’s planned regulation will send a strong message that it plans to keep crime out, thereby encouraging banks.  “I think the general view is that once we have this legislation in place, this will allow the banking services that these businesses need to thrive,” Donegan said.  Still, he said the Isle of Man will seek to keep an open mind about the policies it enacts, suggesting the island will follow the industry closely to potentially develop or change its policies as needed.  He maintains that the island’s roughly 20 startups, employing 30–35 professionals, are finding banking partners elsewhere for the time being, but that all moved to the island in advance of this year’s coming regulation.  Eye on crypto 2.0  Notably, Donegan expects other factors to mitigate any banking concern, citing the rising interest in crypto 2.0 projects like Counterparty and Factom that aim to encourage non-financial use cases for bitcoin technology.  Calling them “pure software plays”, Donegan indicated his belief that these companies can migrate to the island to start working today.  “2.0 is going to be a big deal for us in 2015, and we’ll be putting a big focus behind it,” Donegan explained, noting also that this part of the bitcoin sector generally faces fewer regulatory and banking hurdles.  Donegan also stressed that the Isle of Man offers favorable tax policies for entrepreneurs that want to build 2.0 startups, increase their value and later exit.  “Our strong intellectual property laws allows them to have full ownership of that property when they decide to dispose of it or sell it as part of their exit strategy,” Donegan said. “If you have a 2.0 business and you build that up and then exit, there is no capital gains tax, you pay no capital gains tax on the profits, and there’s no inheritance tax and there’s no tax on dividends.”  He added that the Isle of Man is already in talks with startups working in the distributed applications (Dapp) space in the field of insurance, legal and medical records. Donegan admitted to a strong personal interest in this field, suggesting that he and other Isle of Man officials see this technology as a common sense solution for the future.  “If you have two lawyers transacting on a business or purchase of a property, then that’s going to be code driven, so the contracts will be uploaded to the blockchain,” he added, concluding:  “We’re very very keen on the technology, we think it’s transformational and that we’re really at the very beginning of an explosive development in information technology.”  Brian Donegan image via LinkedIn; Isle of Man image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/03/isle-of-man-ebusiness-chief-bitcoin-legislation-coming-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/045cd19351244c9d037724d30b094b80785b2d18-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The comments follow suggestions by Microsoft users that the company had opened up its offering to users in the UK and Germany.

42398216,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSnfv,1422983739,Australian Bitcoin Exchange Claims Exemption from 10% Government Tax,"Australian exchange Coin Loft has received an official ruling exempting it from having to charge Goods and Services Tax (GST) on local bitcoin sales, according to the company.  The exchange claims the private ruling from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) means that it need not apply the GST to its bitcoin exchange price. As a result, the firm ceased charging the tax on 26th January and says it is the first Australia-based exchange to do so.  The tax must still be charged on the commission component of the order, however, and a Coin Loft blog post also stated that commission fees would increase from 3 to 5% as a result of the process, though the overall price would remain competitive with its GST-charging competitors.  'Severely affected' by tax  Coin Loft  's David Temple told CoinDesk that the company submitted its private ruling application in October and that it was the only Australian exchange charging GST at the time.  Temple said:  ""Our business was severely affected by this, so we decided we had nothing to lose by making the application.""  Other exchanges began adding GST in the weeks following, but after consulting with its legal team Coin Loft decided that pursuing the ruling could produce a favorable result for its customers.  The application process came with ""significant costs"", though, Temple added, so the company decided a commission fee increase of 2% was reasonable as a means to recoup some of that expense.  ""Effectively for the customer we swapped a 10% GST for a 2% commission increase,"" he said.  Competitive advantage  Coin Loft is not disclosing any specific details of its ruling, knowing that the advantage it gains by being first to have such a ruling will be temporary if competitors follow the same path.  ATO private rulings are valid only for the specific case in question and are not binding in other situations, even if circumstances are similar. The office has issued other private rulings pertaining to bitcoin in the past.  The ATO's position on bitcoin has been controversial since it released a ruling on how tax laws apply to bitcoin businesses in August last year. The ruling stated that 10% GST must be applied to all sales of bitcoins themselves, rendering local exchanges unable to compete with overseas exchanges on price.  Melbourne-based Coin Loft, founded by two software developers, has operated as a fixed-price exchange serving the Australian market since January 2014.  It announced it would suspend bitcoin trading after the ATO's ruling was released, although this did not come about.  Another local exchange, CoinJar, decided to move offshore to the UK, while bill paying service Living Room of Satoshi said it would use some international exchanges to avoid passing extra charges to its users.

42398217,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSnew,1422980640,Ziftr Raises Over $850k in E-Commerce Altcoin Sale,"Online shopping startup Ziftr has officially closed the pre-sale of its own altcoin, ziftrcoin, raising over $850,000 in under two months.  Aimed at creating an alternative digital currency for use by merchants and consumers, the project launched on 9th December and formally ended its sale on 23rd January having sold 4.1 million ziftrcoins.  Founded in 2008, Ziftr is a US startup that also offers e-commerce solutions, such as a browser add-on and mobile app.  Project funds will now be used to fund the creation of a suite of tools for merchants in the Ziftr ecosystem, including a merchant API (Ziftrpay), a dedicated digital wallet (Ziftrwallet) and an online marketplace for the altcoin (Ziftrshop).  In statements, CEO Bob Wilkins promised more announcements regarding the project would be forthcoming, while thanking those who were involved:  “I’m humbled by the support we received during the ziftrcoin presale and would like to extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who contributed and made this such a success.”  Wilkins further told CoinDesk that the pre-sale was brought to a close due to a need to stay true to dates originally shared with the bitcoin community.  Though significant, the final total indicates enthusiasm for the project may have tapered off toward the end of the crowdsale. Ziftr raised $600,000 by 23rd December, $150,000 of which was invested by 10x Venture Partners. This suggests just $278,000 was raised over the final four weeks of the sale.  Notably, the company has taken steps to ensure the altcoin's value, offering a $1 redemption guarantee when purchases are made on Ziftrshop.

42398215,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSndx,1422975030,"Meet Darkleaks, a Bitcoin-Powered Black Market for Secrets","A new black market where informants can trade secrets for bitcoin has been announced this week.  Darkleaks  , masterminded by members of crypto-anarchist collective unSystem, will let users sell leaked data in an anonymous, trustless environment powered by bitcoin's blockchain.  Amir Taaki, the project's systems developer, told CoinDesk he hopes to ""[devalue] business models based around proprietary secrecy"" by providing a financial, rather than moral, incentive for insiders to reveal information.  History of radical schemes  The unSystem team has divided opinion with radical projects like the anonymous Dark Wallet, due for release soon, and Dark Market, a P2P eBay-style platform designed to run outside government control.  Darkleaks, which Taaki said has been in development ""on and off for many months"", is no less controversial.  The programmer, known for his anti-censorship stance, argues the Darkleaks concept is ""ethical"", if not necessarily legal. However, detractors are likely to argue that rather than exposing misconduct, the platform's profit-driven structure may, in fact, encourage it.  The marketplace builds on another proof-of-concept, PayPub, revealed last May, that rethinks the moderated, feedback-focused model used by sites like Silk Road.  Unlike other dark markets, there are no third parties to weigh in on disagreements between users. In fact, buyers and sellers on Darkleaks cannot communicate at all. Instead, the marketplace functions via technology – using bitcoin to encrypt, store and release users' files.  The site explains:  ""The software uses bitcoin’s blockchain to encrypt files which are released when payment is claimed by the leaker. Files are split into segments and encrypted. These segments are unlocked only when the leaker reveals the key by claiming his bitcoins.""  To prevent disputes, several of each leaker's file segments are released at random, via a provably fair cryptographic system, on a specified date. This way, potential buyers are able to authenticate and value the leaker's document before making a payment.  'No limits' on content  Darkleaks, as with unSystem's other tools, is ""all about communication, knowledge and economy,"" Taaki said.  However, as the project's page makes clear, there really are no limits on the type of information on sale. Users can monetise everything from evidence of tax evasion or corruption, to more unsavoury items, including stolen databases and naked pictures of A-list celebrities.  While this illicit content puts the platform in a grey legal area, Taaki said the team has not yet received any formal notice from the authorities.  ""Seems like they're happy with our work, otherwise they've had plenty of excuses to try and make moves,"" he added.  Currently, Darkleaks' open-source software is in alpha, with code available to view on the project's GitHub page.  Taaki said he hopes to encourage other developers to build on the project's foundations and make the secrets-for-bitcoin model a reality:  ""I think the idea is widely applicable, so I hope by putting this out there with Python bindings that the community starts to use this concept in novel and interesting ways.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/03/meet-darkleaks-a-bitcoin-powered-black-market-for-secrets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37c3359140943bf85fb1fb8d4ef36d522fd7b9d4-1500x798.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398218,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSngu,1422967453,Bitcoin Mining Firm KnCMiner Raises Further $15 Million,"Bitcoin mining company KnCMiner has raised $15m in Series B funding.  Led by international venture capital fund Accel Partners, the round also included existing investors of the Stockholm-based mining company GP Bullhound and Creandum, as well as noted Swedish investor Martin Wattin.  Creandum led the mining firm's $14m Series A round, announced in September, which also saw participation from GP Bullhound.  KnC  says it plans to use the latest funding in expanding its operational capacity, as well as furthering the development of its next-generation 16-nanometer mining chip.. According to co-founder and CEO Sam Cole, the company has finalised the design of the 16nm chip and expects a smooth development process to take place over the months ahead.  The move comes amid a period of change in the mining space, particularly for hardware manufacturers, after months of declining mining profitability.  KnC itself has faced complaints in recent months regarding late shipments, malfunctioning equipment and sporadic customer service. The firm's shift away from consumer-facing products was first revealed by Bloomberg News in October.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Cole said that KnC is continuing its shift away from being a provider of retail mining hardware and toward a dual role as cloud services provider and bitcoin transaction processor, explaining that the 16nm chip the company will form a key part of its future growth.  “It’s an arms race, and we need a great weapon to be able to compete,"" he said.  VCs bullish on mining's future  Cole said that Accel's participation in the round indicated growing interest among a broader range of investors in bitcoin and expressed the belief that more diverse sources of capital will enter the bitcoin space, with a focus on mining in particular, in the months ahead.  As part of the Series B deal, Accel partner Michiel Kotting will become a member of KnC's board, while Fred Destin, also a partner, will act as an observer.  Kotting said:  “We are excited to back the KnCMiner team, as they have proven to be world-class operators in a very dynamic marketplace. We strongly believe in the long-term potential of bitcoin technology and see large-scale miners like KnCMiner playing a crucial role.”  Creandum general partner Staffan Helgesson added in a statement that his firm welcomes a broader investor pool for KnC.

42398222,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSnkq,1422965775,"Uber, Hotwire Execs Back Micropayments Startup NeuCoin","Micropayments startup NeuCoin has raised $1.25m in angel and seed funding from over 20 individual investors, including King co-founder Patrik Stymne, Uber SVP Emil Michael and Hotwire president Henrik Kjellberg.  The announcement coincides with the official launch of neucoin, a dedicated altcoin that aims to promote online tipping.  NeuCoin co-founder Dan Kaufman said the project would provide a similar service to that of prominent micropayments startup ChangeTip, in which he is an investor, while removing the need for consumers to use bitcoin.  Kaufman told CoinDesk:  ”Basically we think that digital currencies have not been adopted widely by consumers because they’re not easy to use ... and they’re not providing a benefit or a use case that consumers care about.”  NeuCoin’s launch will coincide with the debut of a number of supporting resources for the project, including GetNeuCoin.com, a tutorial site for new users, and MyNeuCoin.com, the site’s online money management portal.  In total, NeuCoin says it has raised $2.25m, with the additional $1m coming in the form of unpaid work the company has so far conducted since 2014.  To start, 3bn neucoins will be pre-mined and distributed to three non-profit organizations controlled by neucoin holders – the Code, Utility and Growth foundations – which will seek to expand and promote the altcoin.  The initial fundraising will be allocated to covering operational costs at the foundations for the project’s first year.  Focus on distribution  Throughout the interview, Kaufman and co-founder Johan Sandstrom sought to frame bitcoin as ill-equipped to become a more widely used micropayments solution, given that its high cost restricts startups from promoting its use.  To pursue this goal, NeuCoin has formed partnerships with YouTube channel MondoMedia, Internet radio startup Jango and artist promotion startup Radio Airplay – the latter two companies of which were originally founded by Kaufman.  Kaufman indicated that NeuCoin will seek to offer its altcoin for free to users of these partner platforms. For example, he indicated NeuCoin-enabled artist pages at Radio Airplay could have prompts that allow users to tip artists 10 neucoins, but receive 25 free.  “You have to give them the experience and then they can buy,” Kaufman explained. ""We think that micropayments really requires some 'freemium' distribution, and that any kind of premium content site would never put up a paywall that would ask people to buy bitcoin.”  Sandstrom further suggested this model has been time-tested, given that games like King's Candy Crush Saga and streaming music services like Spotify provide a free entry-level service to new users that eases them into a new consumer experience.  “Imagine if Candy Crush cost money the first time, it wouldn’t have grown the way it did,” Sandstrom said.  Reducing barriers  Kaufman went on to suggest that while ChangeTip provides a satisfactory experience for bitcoin users, NeuCoin will aim to reduce barriers to entry through a “freemium model” that keeps the value of neucoins low and enables them to be distributed in a cost-effective manner.  Toward this end, the project has brought on strategic advisors, such as dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer and venture capitalist Brock Pierce (who also is a NeuCoin investor), to provide consultation.  In statements, both Palmer and Pierce lauded the experience of the Neucoin team, while expressing their belief in the project and its prospects.  “The NeuCoin team has the best track record of consumer marketers involved in the digital currency space,” Pierce said. “I expect their freemium distribution model to be a successful in onboarding many users to their economy.”  Palmer confirmed that he will be involved in the launch stage of the project, and hinted at how projects like NeuCoin could play an important role in introducing digital currency to content-streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify.  Consumer-first approach  Kaufman and Sandstrom both emphasized their past experience building consumer-facing products as perhaps the project’s key differentiating factor.  “When we tried to get our first bitcoin, we couldn’t do it. It had great promise but [was a] huge turnoff. There’s, like, no-one from the marketing department in the industry,” Kaufman said, before lauding more recent improvements made by top players in the ecosystem.  The co-founders indicated that building a dedicated altcoin for micropayments would also allow them to eliminate other hurdles that would come standard with any bitcoin-based solution.  Both reported that they were inspired by proof-of-stake digital currencies, as well as those that use consensus algorithms to achieve network security such as Ripple and Stellar, citing the high costs of proof-of-work systems as factors that could have limited overall participation in the neucoin community.  Kaufman added that, like Ripple and Stellar, 100 billion neucoins will be created over the lifetime of the project, a factor that should keep the price of individual coins low, even if Neucoin's market cap surges.  Neucoin’s pre-sale is set to begin on 15th February with the price of neucoin starting at $0.01.  Correction: A previous version of this article suggested NeuCoin had raised $2.25m in angel funding. NeuCoin has raised $1m in angel funding, $250,000 in seed funding and raised an additional $1m in its founders' unpaid work.
