34591356,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647493,1728685821,"Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming?","Bitcoin is currently hovering above a key support level, and any minor selloff triggered by a group of traders could potentially snowball into a wave of intense selling pressure. This fragile situation is underscored by data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which revealed that over 30,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.83 billion, has been transferred to crypto exchanges within a short period. Undoubtedly, such a huge amount of BTC entering crypto exchanges is problematic, especially in terms of a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. 30,000 BTC Sold In 72 Hours According to Santiment data highlighted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC have sold or redistributed around 30,000 BTC in the past 72 hours. Considering the current average price of Bitcoin, this comes out to about $1.83 billion worth of BTC exchanging hands. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens #Bitcoin whales have sold or redistributed around 30,000 $BTC in the past 72 hours, totaling $1.83 billion! pic.twitter.com/y9FsARYrmM — Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2024 Exchange inflow data from IntoTheBlock, which tracks the activities of various holder cohorts, reveals that on October 8 alone, around 18,220 BTC was moved to exchanges. This was followed by an additional 16,000 BTC on October 9 and roughly 13,800 BTC on October 10. While not all inflows lead to immediate selloffs, high volumes of BTC entering exchanges often suggest that investors are positioning themselves for potential sales. This continued exchange inflow could signal a buildup of selling pressure, with market participants potentially preparing to liquidate their holdings in the near future. Bitcoin Under Increased Selling Pressure? On a positive note, the current selloffs are largely being driven by short-term holders, which has led to a shift in Bitcoin ownership. Many of the BTC being sold are being scooped up by long-term holders, who view the dip as an opportunity to strengthen their positions. This shift in ownership could stabilize the market, as long-term holders are typically less likely to sell going forward. Related Reading: Second XRP ETF Filing Hits The Market, How Did The XRP Price Respond? Moreover, exchange inflow data shows a gradual decline in the amount of BTC being sent to exchanges each day. This trend indicates that fewer investors are moving their Bitcoin into exchange wallets, which could be a sign that the recent wave of selloffs is losing momentum. In terms of exchange reserve, data from CryptoQuant shows a steady decline in the amount of BTC held on wallets controlled by crypto exchanges since the beginning of October. This decline in exchange reserves contradicts the fears of continued selloffs, as it implies there is less Bitcoin available for sale on exchanges. If this trend continues, it could further reduce the selling pressure and provide a more optimistic outlook for Bitcoin’s near-term recovery. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,854, establishing a price floor of around $60,000.

Bitcoin, the leading crypto asset by market capitalization, shot up 7% from Thursday's trough below $59,000 after the hotter U.S. CPI inflation report, bucking this week's trend of giving up gains during the U.S. trading hours. Recently, BTC was up 5.5% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index's (CD20) 4.7% advance.  Tokens from Solana {{SOL}}, Avalanche {{AVAX}} and Render {{RNDR}} were the leaders among altcoin majors with 6%-8% gains. The only token of the CD20 index with a negative daily return was Uniswap {{UNI}}, which slightly shed some of its Thursday gains that were spurred by the decentralized exchange's plan to launch its own layer-2 network.  The crypto rally happened as equities also gained, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closing the week at record highs. The U.S. dollar index paused below 103 after steeply strengthening over the past week as traders repriced expectations of further Federal Reserve interest rate cuts following solid U.S. jobs reports and hotter inflation readings.  Crypto-related stocks also reflected the positive sentiment. Bitcoin miners including MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Bitdeer (BTDR) soared 5%-10%, while U.S. crypto exchange giant Coinbase (COIN) ended the day up 7%.  MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of BTC with nearly $16 billion of the asset, surged 16% to its highest price since March 2000. The company's share price premium versus its bitcoin holdings also broadened to the widest since 2021.  China fiscal policy update may move crypto  Macroeconomic factors influencing crypto prices have shifted away from monetary policy to the U.S. election outcome, Coinbase analysts David Duong and David Han said in a Friday report.  The key catalyst for crypto volatility might be the upcoming China fiscal policy update by the finance minister slated for early Saturday UTC. Investors anticipate more financial stimulus for the ailing Chinese economy and financial markets, which could reverberate in the digital asset market, the Coinbase report noted.  ""As most markets will be closed during this next briefing, we expect traders could turn to crypto markets as a way to express their (proxy) views on the size and strength of China’s fiscal announcements,"" the authors said.  Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, noted that recent U.S. economic data shows a resilient economy and jobs market, allaying past concerns over an imminent recession.  ""This sets the stage for risk assets to perform well into year-end, and it may take little to drive crypto prices higher,"" Thielen said.

34588867,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647487,1728680420,Baby Doge Coin Rockets 200% In 30 Days – What’s On The Horizon?,"Rising roughly 200% since mid-September, Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) has fundamentally rocked the digital currency market. Reaching early August, it has climbed an impressive 237% from its lowest price this year. The enthusiasm commenced when Baby Doge was listed on Binance. Such listings frequently generate excitement and attract interest in tokens, and BABYDOGE proponents are evidently capitalizing on this momentum. Related Reading: SUI Rallies 100%, But Signs Of Fatigue Emerge – Is A Drop Incoming? Baby Doge: Surpassing September Peaks Following its lows on September 6, Baby Doge experienced a 215% increase within three weeks, albeit undergoing a significant regression to test the $0.0018 level. This 33% decline was promptly rectified in the first week of October. Even as Bitcoin failed to breach the $64,000 barrier level, Baby Doge did even better with a 60% rise in just the same time frame. The rapid rises have also stoked online interest and more buyers are coming in hoping for higher profits. Source: Coinglass Recently, the Open Interest (OI) in Baby Doge has surged from $18 million to an impressive $39 million. The increase in open interest indicates that sentiment is decisively optimistic. The approximately 10% decline in the last 24 hours coincided with a reduction in open interest, indicating that traders are responding to the recent volatility. Speculative Sentiment And Price Forecasts Analysts express optimism on Baby Doge’s potential. Given its substantial community and the recent Binance listing, many anticipate that a price target of $0.0000000045 may be attainable in the forthcoming upward movement. Confidence is increasing, particularly as traders commence purchasing more, perhaps catalyzing more expansion. Currently, Baby Doge is viewed as bullish; according to the forecasts, the price is likely to rise by 227% and may reach $0.00000009113 by 10 November 2024. For the last 30 days, the coin has shown 18 green candles, denoting it has been in good form despite showing an unusually high volatility rate of 25%. Related Reading: Cardano Surges In Strength—Now 10x More Powerful, Analyst Says But it’s not all rosy. The Fear & Greed Index is at 32, a fear signal in the market. That means even as there’s a possibility of expansion, the trader would need to be cautious since the mood can change in the market quite rapidly and external influences can significantly impact price changes. In the event that buying activity continues and optimism prevails, then we may see significant upside momentum. However, if selling pressure is becoming more marked or market conditions deteriorate, then perhaps a test at lower support levels may be encountered before any rally.

34586407,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647430,1728675039,BNB Under Siege: Failed Recovery Sparks Fears of Deeper Losses,"BNB finds itself under renewed selling pressure as a recent recovery attempt falls short, leaving the cryptocurrency vulnerable to further losses. Despite a brief upward movement, BNB’s failure to break through key resistance levels has sparked concerns about a deepening decline. With technical indicators signaling potential weakness ahead, the question now is whether the token can regain its footing or if further losses are inevitable. As bearish sentiment intensifies, this analysis aims to evaluate the technical indicators signaling weakness in BNB’s price action and assess whether the asset can stage a recovery or face more declines. By exploring key support levels, market sentiment, and price trends, the goal is to determine BNB’s next move and the likelihood of a bullish reversal or sustained bearish momentum. Key Technical Indicators Flash Warning Signs BNB has recently entered pessimistic territory on the 4-hour chart, dipping just below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and approaching the crucial $531 support level. This drop below the 100-day SMA indicates weakening strength, and with sellers taking control, the cryptocurrency faces the potential for more losses. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line has dropped below the 50% threshold toward 42%, suggesting that buying pressure is waning, as the RSI moves deeper into bearish territory. Typically, an RSI reading below 50% implies that sellers are gaining control, which could lead to downward pressure on the price. Related Reading: BNB Battles Persistent Bearish Pressure, Will $500 Be The Next Stop? After facing resistance at $587, BNB has shown significant downbeat movement on the daily chart, marked by the formation of a strong bearish candlestick. The price has now fallen toward the 100-day SMA, signaling mounting selling pressure. If the negative trend continues, BNB may experience additional declines, leading to a reduction in buying interest. Furthermore, a closer look at the RSI on the 1-day chart shows that the signal line has once again dropped below the 50% threshold, now sitting at 48%, after previously rising above it. Unless the bulls step in to shift momentum, the market could be set for more drops, as the current RSI level suggests weakening buying strength and heightened bearish control. Trading Strategy: Navigating BNB Bearish Pressure BNB’s recent price action indicates potential continued declines if downbeat momentum intensifies. If the price hits the critical $531 mark and closes below it, this could pave the way for further losses, possibly driving the asset down toward the $500 level. Related Reading: BNB Price Tops $600: Can the Rally Continue? However, should buyers step in and regain control at the $531 level, there is a chance for a bullish reversal and the price will start moving upward toward the 605 resistance level, especially if the RSI shows signs of recovery.

34583903,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647494,1728669621,"Ethereum TD Setup: Why The ETH Price Must Hold $2,250","Ethereum has largely exhibited a sideways movement between $2,500 and $2,350 in the past seven days. This sideways movement has yet to give rise to a clear path as to how the crypto performs moving forward, denting the sentiment of many bulls. In an interesting analysis with the use of the TD Setup, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a critical price point for investors to watch on the ETH price trajectory. At the heart of this analysis is the $2,250 price point, a level that could be the line between a bullish recovery and a steep correction. ETH Price Must Hold $2,250 The TD setup is very popular among crypto analysts and investors. Historically, Ethereum has shown a clear reaction after breaking above or below the TD setup. Its reliability in pinpointing key reversal points has made it a go-to tool for analysts like Ali Martinez. Related Reading: Second XRP ETF Filing Hits The Market, How Did The XRP Price Respond? Using an ETH/US Dollar price chart that he shared on social media platform X, Martinez noted that the TD Sequential has made or broken the cryptocurrency’s price action in the past while also highlighting notable examples. Each time the ETH price broke above the TD setup resistance trendline, a strong bull run has always followed. On the flip side, when ETH dipped below the setup’s support line, it corrected by an average of 53%. The first significant breakout above the TD setup resistance triggered an 8,885% surge, which saw the ETH price reach an all-time high of $1,138 at the time. Conversely, the first time the ETH price broke below the TD setup, it corrected by 56.67%. The latest break above the TD setup occurred in March of this year, which saw the ETH price surge by about 113% as it crossed above $4,000 for the first time in two years. Recent price dynamics puts the TD setup around $2,250. According to Ali Martinez, breaking below this price point could trigger a significant price drop. If a historical 53% average were to repeat itself, Ethereum could correct to as low as $1,100. Current Market Snapshot As of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at approximately $2,410, roughly 7% above the critical $2,250 threshold identified by the TD setup. While the ETH price has managed to stay above this level for now, its proximity to this key price level makes it a critical level to watch. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes Fractal Similar To October 2023, Here’s What Happened Last Time The TD sequential indicator identifies potential points of exhaustion in an asset’s trend, whether bullish or bearish. Therefore, a break below $2,250 could mean the final reversal from a bullish Ethereum to a bearish sentiment. Market sentiment towards Ethereum remains mixed at the moment. Sellers currently have the upper hand, but a break above $2,500 could set the path for a bullish momentum.

According to Helium’s recent blog post, the partnership will bring 100,000+ data-only hotspots around the US, expanding the network’s coverage over the country overnight. Exciting News for Helium Mobile Users! 👏 Ameriband today announced its partnership with @helium_mobile to add 100,000+ Data-Only Hotspots to the Helium Network in the next few months across the US. These Hotspots will help deliver faster, and more reliable coverage to users… — Helium🎈 (@helium) October 9, 2024 “Ameriband’s vast network is deployed in well-known retail businesses, grocery chains, venues, and commercial locations across the country and will help drive usage to the Helium Network. Thanks to this partnership, anyone with a Helium Mobile phone plan will experience connectivity in even more locations than before,” stated Helium in the blog post. This came as a massive win for Helium as the network expansion nearly guarantees connectivity for US users. This means that Helium users who previously experienced connectivity issues will have fewer or zero problems regarding connectivity in the coming weeks and months. It also ensures that the average retail user will have exposure to the Helium network, possibly adding on the growing number of users of the platform’s mobile arm. The carrier offload program caters to 130,274 subscribers from three different network providers with over 122 TB of data routed to the Helium network, figures that will continue to grow as the Ameriband partnership takes effect. Rising Correlation With The Market Leaves Gains Behind For HNT HNT bulls are in the middle of an attempt to retest the current $6.79 resistance level. As of writing, HNT is still on the down-low with the token possibly taking another dive toward $6.23 in the coming days or weeks. The relative strength index (RSI), however, is hinting at a possible bullish reversal within this week or the coming week. Related Reading: Cardano Surges In Strength—Now 10x More Powerful, Analyst Says However, the rising market correlation with the broader market might endanger the token’s bullish momentum that is currently building up.

42407386,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGwxm,1728663075,Scroll Airdrop Allocation Met With Dismay From Farmers,"Airdrop farmers have expressed their disappointment at Scroll's decision to allocate 5.5% of the total supply to the Binance Launchpool.  15% has been set aside for airdrops, with 7% to be distributed on Oct. 22.  Several tokens released on the Binance Launchpool have suffered major declines in asset price shortly after being listed.  Airdrop farmers are up in arms over the release of layer-2 network Scroll's (SCR) airdrop allocation this week, with 7% being set aside for early adopters while centralized exchange Binance will receive 5.5% for its Launchpool users.  Scroll's proposed SCR token will be used for governance purposes with plans to progress it towards being a protocol utility token as Scroll becomes more decentralized.  Total supply for SCR will be 1 billion tokens, 15% of which has been allocated to future airdrops, including 7% that will be distributed on Oct. 22; 17% will go to investors, while the Scroll Foundation will get 10%.  The frustration stems from the 5.5% allocated to the Binance Launchpool. Binance users can increase their allocation by ""staking"" larger amounts of Binance's BNB token to the launchpool, making the distribution skewed in favor of larger holders.  ""You still grinding for airdrops like it's 2022? Time to face reality; Scroll’s 7% for 2 years of effort while 5% to Binance Launchpool farmers in days, shows how we’re being milked & VC's are favored. Airdrop meta has changed!"" X user Axel Bitblaze wrote.  One of Scroll's core contributors, named sandyzkp on X, responded to criticism by saying, ""Binance is more than just a listing, it's the best channel to reach global distribution, it will open the on-ramp and off-ramp channels and help us grow to the next stage, especially in emerging markets.""  It's also worth noting that several tokens released on the Binance Launchpool suffered disappointing starts in terms of trading performance. Arkham's ARKM dropped from its debut price of 90 cents to 30 cents, while Portal's PORTAL fell from $3.60 to $2.08 three days after being issued.

42407377,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGwXK,1728660371,Has Ethereum Lost Its Way?,"Ethereum has come a long way since the network went live in 2015 under the codename Frontier, transforming from a grand idea into what is now the foundation for thousands of decentralized applications.  Still, with a rise in blockchains like Bitcoin and Solana competing for Ethereum’s developer and user base, the ecosystem is beginning to falter and lack direction, losing sight of what it originally intended to do. Even its value remains a bit flat. Ethereum’s token price still hasn’t successfully broken its all-time high of $4700, which it reached in 2021.  This raises the question, has Ethereum lost its way? If so, how do we get it back on track?  As Confucius once said, “The man who chases two rabbits, catches neither.” Between chasing Solana’s faster execution and the ultra-sound money narrative that competes with Bitcoin’s hard money, Ethereum has lost sight of its original vision of becoming the World Computer. Péter Szilágyi, an Ethereum Team Lead, said “Ethereum is losing the plot.” Even Ethereum’s “ultrasound money” status is being questioned as its inflation rate reaches 0.74%, driven by the reduced transaction activity and ETH burn rate. While others advocate for ETH to retain its deflationary nature, it is important to remember that ultrasound money was never the goal.  Ethereum is more than just a currency and it has never been about having the fastest TPS or the lowest gas fees; it has always been about building a truly decentralized future. Vitalik Buterin and other co-founders created Ethereum to become a World Computer — a universal network consisting of thousands of computers on which anyone can build decentralized applications from anywhere. While building to enhance accessibility and interoperability, the ecosystem is distracted by the latest trends and has lost focus.  With the price dropping below $2500, it’s been thought that the cause of ETH underperforming is related to the applications being built on the network. Many of today’s dApps on Ethereum gain short-term hype, but the reputation of a clunky UI and underdeveloped platforms lead to limited usage and slow user growth. Additionally, these applications often garner the attention of the same users siloed in various L2s. Without usable applications, Ethereum can't reach its goal of becoming the World Computer.  Ethereum’s primary ambitions hinge on robust infrastructure, not applications. Decentralized compute, with secondary and tertiary networks that feed into Ethereum, are being developed as we speak, indicating how Ethereum’s infrastructure is showing signs of advancement. Even enterprises are beginning to favor permissionless networks like Ethereum over private corporate networks now that it’s become much cheaper to develop on permissionless chains.  But, even with these advancements, Ethereum is still improving at a slow place with the network stuck in the middle of the scaling roadmap, a less exciting time where Merkle Trees, zkSTARKS, account abstraction, and technologies that unify desperate L2s are coming to fruition.  There needs to be less short-term thinking. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum will come out of the doldrums of seemingly little activity. Ethereum is having its “Lightning moment” and it needs to drop the ultra-sound money narrative and stop trying to catch Solana. Ethereum has a clear path to fix this for those who pay attention. For example, we still haven’t seen how people will use Blobs beyond being a space for rollup fraud-proof challenge windows.  Following the Dencun upgrade in March, Pectra is the next major Ethereum upgrade scheduled for the end of 2024, and further down Ethereum’s roadmap is The Purge. This upgrade will play an important role in Ethereum keeping pace with other chains and handling the influx of activity once the chain achieves broader adoption. The Purge will simplify the protocol by clearing old history, which will eliminate technical debt and reduce costs of participating in the network.  While removing historical state comes with benefits, it leaves the chain vulnerable to data being gobbled up by centralized entities making Ethereum a data-centered chain. Ethereum then becomes more of a billboard with less trustlessness properties. This problem hinders the next phase of the World Computer because downstream activity, like multi-agent AI systems and decentralized compute, can’t scale if there’s no data to look to. This is solved through one type of solution: decentralized long-term data availability.  Yes, right now, Ethereum is stuck in the middle of the scaling roadmap. However, Ethereum can get back on track by directing its focus to infrastructure. This is what will truly allow the network to fulfill its role as the World Computer. As Ethereum reaches the end of the roadmap and achieves decentralized compute in the years to come, the World Computer will function effortlessly bolstered by none other than robust global infrastructure.

34579494,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24308,1728659460,Is There Demand for Bitcoin Staking?,"Bitcoin staking is revolutionising the way Bitcoin holders can utilise their Bitcoin, allowing them to earn rewards while also opening the door to Decentralised Finance (DeFi) use cases. Protocols like Babylon, Build On Bitcoin (BOB), and platforms such as Stacks enable users to stake their Bitcoin in a trustless, self-custodial manner, enhancing both liquidity and network security. This approach integrates innovative mechanisms like slashing for malicious behaviour and fast un-bonding, aligning with Bitcoin’s core strengths of censorship resistance and decentralisation. As demand for staking grows, Bitcoin is expanding beyond its role as a store of value, becoming a key player in DeFi. Stake Bitcoin and Earn a Yield While You Hodl As the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve, the rise of Bitcoin staking is opening up new avenues for Bitcoin holders to earn rewards while also creating opportunities for Bitcoiners to participate in DeFi use cases that were previously only available on Web3 blockchains. Traditionally, Bitcoin has been viewed as a store of value, but the advent of staking layers built on top of Bitcoin is transforming its utility. Protocols like Babylon , Build on Bitcoin (BOB) , Solv , and platforms such as Stacks are enabling Bitcoin holders to stake their assets in a decentralised, trustless manner, allowing them to participate in locking their Bitcoin and earning staking rewards. Bitcoin staking is particularly compelling because it allows users to earn yield without having to rely on third-party custodians or bridge assets to other blockchains. This model emphasises Bitcoin’s strength as a censorship-resistant and secure asset, leveraging its Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain as a backbone for other decentralised systems. By staking Bitcoin, participants can provide economic security to PoS chains, ensuring that validators remain honest while simultaneously enhancing Bitcoin’s liquidity and utility. The demand for Bitcoin staking has surged, especially with innovations like Babylon’s Bitcoin staking protocol, which allows users to stake their Bitcoin in a self-custodial manner. This staking solution integrates unique mechanisms such as slashing conditions and fast un-bonding , ensuring that stakers maintain liquidity while protecting the staking layer’s network from malicious behaviour. The ability to slash stakers for safety violations adds an extra layer of security to PoS chains, and the use of Bitcoin timestamping ensures synchronisation between PoS networks, Layer 2s, and the Bitcoin blockchain. As Bitcoin continues to position itself as a participant in DeFi, these staking protocols are paving the way for future use cases. With multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions now integrating staking options, the ecosystem is growing beyond its traditional role as a store of value. Investors and institutions alike are recognizing the potential to leverage their Bitcoin holdings for both yield generation and enhanced security across various decentralised systems being built on Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols . Decentralised Bitcoin Staking May be the Best Path for Returns on BTC The demand for earning a yield on BTC holdings has surged in recent years, as many holders are looking for ways to generate passive income from their BTC without selling their assets. Bitcoin has been viewed primarily as a store of value or digital gold in the past, but with the growing sophistication of DeFi, and the lines beginning to blur between Web3 and Bitcoin, opportunities have emerged for BTC holders to earn a return on their holdings through various staking and yield-generating mechanisms. This trend reflects the evolving role of Bitcoin beyond a simple asset to hold, as users increasingly seek to maximise the utility of their BTC by participating in staking protocols that offer returns in the form of additional BTC or other assets. Decentralised staking, especially liquid staking, has gained significant traction as one of the most promising paths forward for BTC holders seeking yield. Unlike traditional staking, where assets are locked up and inaccessible, liquid staking allows users to stake their BTC while still maintaining liquidity through derivative tokens that can be used across various DeFi platforms. This flexibility is highly appealing to Bitcoin holders who want the benefits of staking, such as earning yield and securing networks, without losing access to their funds. The rise of liquid staking platforms and protocols has been accompanied by substantial demand, as users lock their BTC into these systems to earn a return while retaining the ability to deploy their capital elsewhere. The growing interest in BTC staking is evident from the rapid adoption of various staking platforms designed specifically for Bitcoin. As more Bitcoin users look for ways to earn a return on their holdings, decentralised staking and liquid staking protocols are emerging as the ideal solutions, offering both security and flexibility. These platforms allow users to tap into the value of their BTC in ways that were previously not possible, creating new avenues for wealth generation while maintaining control over their assets. With the increasing demand and innovation in this space, it’s clear that staking represents a significant shift in how Bitcoin holders engage with their investments, moving from passive holding to actively earning yields. A Look at Some of the Options for Staking BTC Babylon Chain Babylon Chain offers a novel staking solution for Bitcoin, allowing BTC holders to contribute to the security of PoS blockchains without the need for third-party custody or token wrapping. By leveraging Bitcoin’s inherent strengths, its censorship-resistant blockspace and secure PoW consensus, Babylon Chain introduces a Bitcoin staking protocol that enables users to lock their BTC in self-custodian vaults, providing slashable economic security to PoS networks. This innovative approach allows Bitcoin holders to stake their assets while maintaining full control, earning staking rewards while ensuring that misbehaviour, such as double-signing on PoS chains, leads to slashing of the violator’s Bitcoin. One of the standout features of Babylon Chain’s BTC staking is its focus on security and liquidity. Unlike traditional PoS systems where un-bonding periods can be lengthy, Babylon’s integration of Bitcoin timestamping allows for faster and more secure un-bonding, synchronising staker sets with Bitcoin’s chain. This means Bitcoin stakers can quickly reclaim their BTC without compromising on security. Babylon’s approach to Bitcoin staking not only offers a new earning potential for Bitcoin holders but also enhances the decentralised security of multiple PoS blockchains by enabling Bitcoin to serve as a foundational layer of trust and economic backing. Babylon recently saw $1.5 billion in value locked as the staking cap was lifted recently. Solv Solv offers a unique approach to Bitcoin staking through its Decentralised Bitcoin Reserve, which unlocks the potential of Bitcoin as a stakable asset within DeFi ecosystems. By addressing the fragmentation of Bitcoin assets across different platforms, Solv provides an infrastructure that allows Bitcoin holders to earn yield while contributing to the liquidity and security of decentralised systems. This is achieved through a consensus-driven liquidity model, which not only provides staking opportunities but also opens the door for institutional investors to participate in Bitcoin staking with confidence. Solv’s solutions are designed to ensure compliance, security, and liquidity, making it an attractive option for those seeking to earn rewards while maintaining the flexibility to utilise their BTC in various financial applications. Solv’s staking protocols are backed by robust security measures, including extensive audits from well-respected firms like Quantstamp and Certik. These measures provide additional assurance for stakers, ensuring the safety and integrity of their assets. With support from prominent investors and the integration of staking into broader DeFi ecosystems, Solv is positioned as a leading platform for Bitcoin holders to not only safeguard their assets but also actively grow them through staking rewards, all while contributing to the decentralisation and security of blockchain networks. Solve recently surpassed over $470 million in Total Value Locked (TVL). pStake pSTAKE offers an innovative solution for Bitcoin holders looking to stake their assets and earn rewards through liquid staking. By enabling users to stake their Bitcoin in a trustless and decentralised manner, pSTAKE allows them to participate in securing blockchain networks without sacrificing liquidity. When users stake their BTC through pSTAKE, they receive a tokenized representation of their staked assets, which can then be used in DeFi applications to generate additional yield. This liquid staking model provides the dual benefit of earning staking rewards while still being able to access the liquidity of their Bitcoin, making it a flexible option for those looking to maximise the utility of their holdings. Moreover, pSTAKE enhances the security of staked Bitcoin by integrating with leading PoS networks, offering slashable security guarantees to the underlying protocols. By providing a decentralised infrastructure for Bitcoin staking, pSTAKE not only helps secure these networks but also opens up new earning opportunities for BTC holders. Its seamless integration with DeFi protocols ensures that users can easily stake their assets, participate in yield farming, or engage in other financial activities, all while contributing to the security and decentralisation of blockchain ecosystems. B.O.B. Build On Bitcoin (B.O.B.) offers a one-click staking solution for Bitcoin holders, allowing users to easily participate in DeFi and earn staking rewards. By partnering with Everstake, a well-regarded staking provider, B.O.B. simplifies the process for both retail and institutional investors, enabling them to stake their Bitcoin without the need for complex technical knowledge. The B.O.B. platform integrates liquid staking into its ecosystem, providing Bitcoin holders with the opportunity to earn yield while maintaining liquidity for their assets. This approach opens up access to decentralised financial products, allowing users to generate returns on their Bitcoin without having to sell or lock up their assets indefinitely. What makes B.O.B. particularly appealing is its seamless user experience and growing ecosystem of premium liquid staking derivatives and DeFi partners. The integration of B.O.B.’s staking SDK (Software Development Kit) with the Everstake platform offers a streamlined experience, enabling users to deploy their Bitcoin across various DeFi platforms with ease. As Bitcoin staking continues to gain traction, B.O.B. positions itself as a valuable gateway for Bitcoin holders to engage with staking and liquidity opportunities, broadening the utility of BTC within the DeFi space. Stacks Stacks is a Bitcoin layer that extends the functionality of Bitcoin by enabling smart contracts and DApps while leveraging Bitcoin’s security. Stacks introduces a mechanism called “stacking,” which, while similar to staking, operates differently. Instead of locking up Bitcoin directly, users lock up Stacks’ native token (STX) to support the Stacks network. In return, they earn Bitcoin as a reward. This is possible because Stacks anchors its operations to Bitcoin, effectively allowing participants to earn a yield on their BTC by participating in the network’s consensus mechanism and contributing to its security and decentralisation. Unlike traditional staking, where users lock native tokens (like ETH on Ethereum) to secure the network and earn rewards in that same token, stacking with Stacks allows users to earn Bitcoin as a reward while supporting the growth of the Stacks ecosystem. This offers Bitcoin holders a unique way to earn yield on their BTC without giving up the benefits of Bitcoin’s decentralised and secure network. Through stacking, users can generate returns in Bitcoin while also helping to grow a broader ecosystem of applications and services built on Bitcoin.

34578942,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647446,1728658831,XRP Price Is In ‘Uncharted Territory’: Here’s What It Means,"Crypto analyst Egrag has provided an historical analysis of the weekly XRP price chart, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is entering “uncharted territory.” Utilizing historical data and focusing on critical technical indicators. Egrag highlights significant shifts in XRP’s trading behavior, emphasizing the exhaustion felt by the XRP community during this prolonged cycle. “This cycle has been extremely exhausting and super manipulative, especially when it comes to XRP. But don’t lose hope!” he states. Why XRP Is In Uncharted Territory Central to Egrag’s analysis are two key indicators plotted on a weekly scale: the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 55-week Simple Moving Average (MA). Both indicators are renowned for their responsiveness to price changes and have historically been indicative of market momentum shifts for XRP. The interactions between these moving averages, particularly when they cross, are pivotal in forecasting potential bullish or bearish trends. Related Reading: XRP Could Surge To $60 Overnight Using SWIFT Model, Expert Says Egrag identifies three types of crosses in his analysis, each signaling different market sentiments. A bearish cross, marked by a red circle on his chart, occurs when the 21-week EMA crosses below the 55-week MA, indicating potential downward momentum. A bullish cross, denoted by a green circle, happens when the 21-week EMA crosses above the 55-week MA, signaling possible upward movement. An indecisive cross, represented by an orange circle, marks periods where the moving averages converge but do not decisively cross, reflecting uncertainty or possible market manipulation. In Cycle A, XRP experienced a bearish cross followed by two bullish crosses, with significant implications for its price trajectory. The period from the bearish cross to the first bullish cross spanned approximately 616 days, during which the market sentiment gradually shifted. Midway through this cycle, there was another bearish cross about 140 days after the first bullish cross, preceding the second bullish cross that occurred 49 days later. This second bullish cross led to an explosive price movement. Egrag remarks, “We had a bearish cross, followed by two bullish crosses—one midway through the cycle and the second was explosive! Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Soar Past $5.85, Predicts Crypto Analyst Cycle B presented a different scenario, featuring one bearish cross followed by one bullish cross. The duration from the bearish to the bullish cross was approximately 763 days, indicating a prolonged period of bearish sentiment before the market shifted. During this cycle, XRP narrowly missed an earlier bullish cross due to a significant price dump, which prevented the moving averages from crossing as they might have otherwise. “Mid-cycle, XRP narrowly missed the bullish cross due to a major price dump,” notes Egrag. Currently, in Cycle C, XRP is exhibiting behavior that differs from the previous cycles both in duration and complexity. From the first bearish cross to the first bullish cross, the cycle lasted about 441 days, longer than in prior cycles. Subsequently, there was a period of 399 days leading to a second bearish cross. In total, Cycle C has spanned approximately 987 days from the first bearish cross, making it the longest cycle since XRP’s inception. At present, the 21-week EMA and the 55-week MA are converging but have not decisively crossed, marked by an orange circle indicating an indecisive cross. Egrag expresses frustration at this development, stating, “Right now, both indicators (21 EMA & 55 MA) are in the orange circle—right on the verge of a manipulated bullish cross that we narrowly avoided. This is pure manipulation! ” Egrag’s analysis suggests that Cycle C’s unprecedented duration and deviation from previous patterns place XRP in “uncharted territory,” indicating that the market may be poised for an outcome not previously observed. “After breaking down all these crosses, my takeaway is that Cycle C is different from Cycles A & B based on the number of crosses and duration. We’re in uncharted territory, so we’re likely to witness something new this time,” he asserts. However, Egrag remains optimistic about the future. He envisions the potential onset of a ‘utility phase’ for XRP, where the focus shifts from speculative trading to practical applications of the cryptocurrency. “In my optimistic view, I hope this is the moment the utility phase kicks in, allowing us to use our XRP instead of selling it!” he concludes. At press time, XRP traded at $0.53.

The Fed's interest rate cuts have weakened the USD, boosting Bitcoin as a currency hedge. New ETFs and CEFs tracking Bitcoin have increased investor confidence and broadened its appeal. Both major political parties are showing support for crypto, enhancing its regulatory environment and investor confidence. Main Thesis & Background The purpose of this article is to evaluate the broader equity market and explain why I believe Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) could continue to trend higher in the months to come. As readers are likely aware, this has been a winning play in 2024 - along with many other ""risk-on"" assets. For perspective, here is BTC's year-to-date move compared to US equities: 2024 YTD Returns (Google Finance) As you can see, the market has clearly been favoring cryptocurrency and this has propelled BTC back to historic levels, along with other digital currencies. For my followers, this is a follow-up to a positive review I wrote about BTC just under a year ago. This exemplifies that BTC's run in 2024 has not been an anomaly but back of a longer-term trend higher: BTC Performance (Seeking Alpha) The fact is that BTC has been on a tear for a while and those who agreed with my buy call have been rewarded handsomely. While a victory lap is always fun, what is more important is where the asset trades going forward . In my opinion, the view is still bright ahead because of regulatory acceptance, increased legitimacy among the public, lower interest rates, and a weaker US dollar. I will tackle each of these topics in detail below. Why The Strength? Fed/Interest Rates A Big Reason I will start with a look back at why Bitcoin has been performing so well. There are multiple reasons of course, but a big one has been the weakening US dollar. Due to the Fed's decision to finally cut interest rates (and the market's expectation leading up to it that they would do so) assets with a negative correlation to the USD have fared very strongly. This includes commodities, precious metals, bonds, and, as it is relevant here, Bitcoin. This is a fairly simple concept, but its importance cannot be overstated. When the USD weakens, it takes more of said currency to buy the same amount of another asset, all other things being equal. This means that as USD has faced headwinds, investors have rotated into currency hedges (like BTC) to protect the value of their portfolio: USD Index (Bloomberg) This clearly shows the USD is well off its highs and I don't see it resuming an upward trend any time soon. The Fed is likely to continue with rate cuts and that means investors will want to lock in higher yields in bonds and also shift to USD hedges, such as hard assets and crypto. My point here is not that Bitcoin is the only way to play this. There are a plethora of ways one can approach an environment where the USD is seeing a decline in value. But that doesn't mean we should ignore its impact on Bitcoin. This is one of a few examples of assets that tend to perform quite well when investors are worried about inflation and a declining dollar. Since that remains top-of-mind for many as we push into Q4, my bullish outlook on Bitcoin continues to stay in place. New Investment Options Push Interest In BTC Another reason I remain a Bitcoin bull has to do with the investment landscape as a whole. After regulatory approval from the SEC - and eventual launching - of a number of ETFs and CEFs that track the spot price of Bitcoin, more investors are warming up to the idea of owning this asset. In my view, this is only a trend that will continue. The legitimacy that comes with these formal fund options will give more people the confidence to buy into this asset class rather than just buying it directly through means like PayPal Holdings, Inc. ( PYPL ) or through other exchanges that haven't really been time-tested. And this isn't just my opinion. Recent surveys show the public warming up to Bitcoin in a broad fashion: Public Attitudes on Crypto (The Harris Poll) I see this as a fundamental shift in how the world (and especially investors) will view crypto going forward. It is no longer as misunderstood or as mistrusted as it used to be. As the asset becomes more visible, more regulated, and more on the minds of average investors, the higher the price is likely to climb. This is central to my long-term bull view of Bitcoin. Election A Catalyst? My how times have changed when it comes to the political environment! With 2024 being an election year - and the public having a more favorable view of Bitcoin - it shouldn't be a surprise that Washington has a more favorable view of it as well! Taking each party, and nominee in turn, we will start with Donald Trump. He has been a recent champion of crypto, quoted as recently saying he wants to make America the ""crypto capital of the planet"". This is surely a nod to attract younger and perhaps more tech-savvy voters, two blocks he would be keen to attract to his campaign. But the support goes deeper than just Mr. Trump. In fact, the RNC highlights crypto on its official platform . There is a paragraph highlighting that Mr. Trump will protect the right to ""mine Bitcoin"" and ""ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control"". This is a straight-up endorsement of Bitcoin (and other cryptos) in my view and if it helps either Mr. Trump or the Republican Party in November I find it hard to believe they will switch course on this. If it is successful in attracting votes, I imagine they will stick with their pro-crypto stance. This bodes well for the regulatory environment and should improve investors' confidence in the space. Shifting gears, crypto lovers will find support among Kamala Harris as well. The Harris campaign released a policy outline that states her agenda will ""encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting our consumers and investors"". This is certainly a bid in favor of crypto and is a keen effort to stay on top of the issue and be consistent with the Trump campaign. While the current Biden administration is not considered wildly bullish for crypto given the SEC's crackdown on the industry following the failure of the FTX exchange, the truth is that Bitcoin has done quite well during the administration and Ms. Harris is a part of it. What I see here is a win-win. Both candidates are either subtly or aggressively courting crypto fans and that is a welcome move for the industry. It is hard to see how this could be anything but positive for prices. Earnings Growth Seen Declining For Mag 7 Another reason to be considering crypto assets right now has to do with the relative attractiveness of equity hedges. As I already noted, Bitcoin has done well alongside many other asset classes this year. That overwhelmingly includes Big Tech and the famous ""Mag 7"" that have dominated headlines this year. While I am certainly a large-cap US bull - always have been and likely always will be - there are times I favor moving cash into that sector more than others. For now, I remain concerned that concentration in large-cap indices, such as the S&P 500, is not healthy. This means I continue to rotate new cash into alternative strategies at its expense, including through Bitcoin. One reason for this has to do with earnings growth. Importantly, this is still a ""good"" figure, and I am in no way advocating a bearish stance on US Tech or the Mag 7. Quite the contrary - I own a lot of it! But I am saying that investors would be wise to exercise some prudence here. Equity levels are at all-time highs and earnings growth has slowed. Yes, it is still quite positive, but it is well off the highs we saw in 2023: ESP Growth (FactSet) In relative terms, we can see that earnings growth has come down by a decent clip. It remains in healthy double-digit numbers but helps justify why diversification should be on the minds of most investors. With concentration risk elevated and earnings slowing, thinking outside the box is probably a good move to wrap up 2024. That could include an asset like Bitcoin, or many of the other hedges I have discussed in prior reviews. Bottom line Bitcoin has been one of my best calls over the past year and I have room to believe more gains are on the way. This upward trend is due to multiple factors, including regulatory changes, improving public sentiment, lower interest rates (here and abroad), and also an increase in institutional adoption. The last point is actually an important one because it helps explain the widening breadth of those investing in this space. For example, a recent study conducted by Ernst and Young showed a majority of financial professionals holding 1% or more of assets under management in the world of crypto: Percentage Allocated To Crypto (Financial Professionals) (E&Y) These are the types of graphics I find so revealing because while it may seem that currencies such as Bitcoin are still a fringe investment idea, it is actually very mainstream. In fact, more people are warming up to it than the opposite, suggesting the best days are still ahead. Hopefully, this review gives my followers confidence in the future of Bitcoin and will give everyone some food for thought as we push into the final stages of the year.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4726218-bitcoin-further-gains-could-be-forthcoming-btcusd-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34578975.jpeg
42407379,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGwdw,1728658703,"FTX's Salame Hoped Dog Bite Would Delay Prison, But Tucker Carlson Derailed Effort","Ex-senior executive of failed crypto exchange FTX Ryan Salame kept trying to delay his prison arrival up to the last minute, but a judge decided his dog-bite claims fell short of keeping him from his 7.5-year sentence.  An interview Salame did with Tucker Carlson seems to have helped convince the federal judge that he was well enough to report to prison.  Former FTX executive Ryan Salame, convicted of violating U.S. election laws in his contribution of millions of dollars in the previous congressional elections, has been rebuffed in an 11th-hour attempt to delay his prison sentence to treat a dog bite to his face.  A defiant Salame, who had taken to social media to criticize his prosecution, was originally supposed to start serving more than seven years in prison on August 29 but told the court he'd been injured by a large German shepherd, leading to his reporting date being postponed to Oct. 11. He requested another extension earlier this week, ostensibly to continue treating the same dog bite.  But he sat for an interview with Tucker Carlson without obvious signs he's hampered by the wound – a fact noted by Judge Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York when the court denied Salame's effort.  Salame had claimed a need for ""urgent and necessary medical treatment and surgery"" that wouldn't allow his immediate incarceration, and the prosecution had responded that he appeared to be doing fine. At a court appearance last month, he answered questions ""with no signs of drooling or slurred speech,"" prosecutors contended, and then did his interview with Carlson – a conservative political commentator who had been a longtime fixture at Fox News – during which Salame ""appears physically recovered and entirely unimpaired.""  Salame has already benefited ""from extremely generous postponements of the commencement of the term of imprisonment,"" the judge noted, adding the court's doubts about the ""veracity"" of Salame's claims.  The former CEO of an FTX subsidiary has publicly embraced his pending inmate status, noting on his LinkedIn page that he's started a role as an inmate, and featuring a prison picture on his page on X and wearing mock prisoner attire.  Prosecutors have also been pursuing his girlfriend, prominent crypto advocate Michelle Bond, for allegedly taking illegal campaign contributions from Salame during her failed run for Congress in New York.

42407382,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGwkY,1728656598,DePIN Promises Small Business Innovation in Emerging Markets,"DePIN deserves the hype. Projects in the space are creating technologies that stand to change, at least to a degree, the reigning cloud computing model, whileproviding users with sustainable economic incentives to uphold the networks. This could be the basis for new models of economic development.  The decentralization of cloud computing is the creation of a two-sided marketplace. Node networks, the most common infrastructure underpinning DePIN projects, are an efficient and secure way for users to actually own parts of the network.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  Physical assets like telecom infrastructure or video streaming networks can be divided up, apportioned and owned by node owners for a small profit. Users then pay to access that network that is sustained by the many, instead of owned by the few.  We need to consider the importance of node operators to a local economy and local innovations. DePIN networks might actually enable the little guy to win, for once.  For example, Helium’s network is being deployed for livestock tracking in Africa, helping to protect endangered species while supporting farmers’ livelihoods. Helium CEO Abhay Kumar CEO noted that: ""The cow in this case, or the livestock in this case, is sort of the center of the economy for this community.”  Indeed, this is a local innovation born from DePIN.  In the emerging markets, physical infrastructure is unreliable or even nonexistent. Those markets therefore stand to be the first mover of mass adoption of decentralized networks of nodes. This is because nodes can be a small business, akin to operating a produce stall or a bicycle repair shop.  So we need to think of nodes as “micro businesses franchises” rather than an immediate cypherpunk global revolution in radical decentralization.  DePIN is not a crypto gimmick; it’s actually a small business for node operators  New ideas take time. Yet, technology is often adopted much faster in the emerging markets. Banking adoption in Africa skipped internet banking and went straight to mobile banking. Localized innovations meant African payments and credit business models emerged.  This is how we should think about DePIN, a slow revolution that the big tech giants won’t see coming as it emerges gradually through various local drivers in certain geographies. Drivers such as the utility of operating a computing node as a small business.  The DePIN supply-side business model is already slowly changing how we think about ownership of physical infrastructure networks. Still, on the demand side for Westerners this might not yet be a revolutionary moment. I’ll just stick with Zoom or Telegram and rely on AWS Cloud, thanks. Just a side hustle for Western node operators, this could be a personal finance game changer for node operators in emerging markets.  Running cloud computing nodes for a modest profit is not a gimmick or a crypto quirk, but rather it is a very viable economic engagement that, in turn, provides localized value in the form of strong and reliable networks for users.  Just think about a node operator in Bangladesh who sells cloud storage space to local users and businesses who need better and more reliable service. The businesses will pay less than by using AWS and the node operator can perhaps live off the income derived from that node. In theory, everyone in this scenario wins.  New ideas will start in the emerging markets  Most importantly, DePIN technology will also lead to new and innovative business models AWS cannot replicate.  Cheaper local nodes will create more local start ups, driving localized development and promoting ownership. The emerging markets will influence new business models, based on operating nodes for a modest profit.  Further distance education, streaming, gaming and healthcare can all be improved by better internet services. AWS won’t solve these problems: locals facing local problems will.  Nodes can feed a family, but more importantly, they can fund human capital. The person working a menial job, by owning a node, might have enough income now, to have the luxury of time to create new things, new ideas, new localized businesses based off of the learnings from running a node.  DePIN addresses more than lags, it’s a catalyst for global innovation  However, while this revolution starts in the emerging markets, innovation will sprout everywhere.  Latency issues, or lags and glitches, in the emerging markets hinder innovation. But, in truth, they hinder productivity everywhere.  DePIN means that nodes can be localized — for better internet — not just in India, but even in dense cities like New York City. The close proximity of Huddle01 nodes in New York, for example, already means that latency can be lessened and even outperform big tech. New ideas will also emerge in NYC and beyond from better internet speeds.  So the real question is what new business models can be created by DePIN? Like the early days of internet super-apps in China, fintech innovations in Africa, what innovations will node operators in India create?  We are in DePIN to support that human capital. It’s exciting, and it’s early. But DePIN node operator “micro franchise programs” – or whatever we call them next – can be a dynamo for local economic development, and for humanity.

Though there has been growth, we're already seeing client churn. 96% of IREN's reported revenue between July and September was derived from Bitcoin mining. The economics of which are fundamentally flawed. The company is positioning to be a leader in the AI compute data center space, though I have serious doubts about the sustainability of such endeavors. In my last Seeking Alpha article covering Iris Energy/IREN ( IREN ) back in August 2023, I focused primarily on the beginning of the company's pivot to AI and HPC services after purchasing NVIDIA ( NVDA ) chips. While I called the stock a 'buy' at $4.90 per share, I was far less enthusiastic about the short term prospects for generative AI applications: I'm less convinced that chasing generative AI will be a fruitful endeavor any time soon as I believe we're already seeing interest declines with those applications. I'll admit I was probably a little too bearish interest in generative AI applications at the consumer level at that time, but I don't think skepticism about the profitability of such business lines is unfounded. Consider the recent report that OpenAI is projected to lose $44 billion between 2023 and 2028. That's a lot of cash to light on fire building 'the future' of potential copyright infringement . For me, AI is still very much driven by hype in 2024. This brings us back to IREN. As of 10/10/24 (IREN Homepage) Today, we see a company that is nearly entirely leaned in on HPC data centers. Despite IREN's plans for the future, the core business is still almost entirely reliant on mining Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). In this update, we'll look at the company's recent corporate performance, Q3-24 mining production, and some additional considerations prospective shareholders should keep in mind. Year Ended June 2024 For the company's fiscal year, IREN reported just under $189 million in total revenue. Nearly 98% of that revenue came from Bitcoin mining: Revenue Segments (IREN, Annual Report) Just $3.1 million of the company's total revenue in the fiscal year came from AI cloud services. We'll get into this segment a bit more in a moment. But this is somewhat forgivable as AI cloud services are a new business line for IREN. The company has notoriously adopted an anti-HODL strategy when mining BTC. There are benefits to this because the price of the coin is still so volatile. Unlike other Bitcoin miners who have BTC in corporate treasury, IREN's primary exposure to Bitcoin's price is in top line revenue numbers rather than in digital asset holdings that can dramatically alter quarterly net income based on FASB accounting rules. Month EH/s Public Industry Rank June 25.0 3rd May 24.4 7th April 43.5 5th Source: Compass Mining For this, I actually like IREN because it gives us a real world view of the true mining economics of a company that has generally been near the top of the industry historically based on monthly exahash metrics. Back in June, IREN had the third highest exahash figure in the industry at 25.0 EH/s. Despite selling all production and maintaining a competitive fleet within the industry, IREN still couldn't generate a profit in the quarter ended June: Data by YCharts There is certainly a Bitcoin halving story at the core of this performance. But total opex has exceeded revenue 7 of the last 9 quarters: Data by YCharts It's quite clear the company is aggressively trying to scale data center capacity. Given the difficulty in raising debt at favorable terms for Bitcoin mining, IREN has instead gone the dilution route to raise capital. At the end of June, the company had $404.6 million in cash, no long term debt, and a shares outstanding figure that nearly tripled in just one year. September Production IREN BTC Production (IREN, Author's Chart) For month ended September, IREN reported 347 Bitcoin mined on an average operating exahash of 16.5 EH/s. Mining revenue in the month came in at $21.4 million in September and $50 million for the quarter. Monthly Key Metrics (IREN) In this table shared by IREN in its September update, we can see AI cloud services revenue actually fell by 47% month over month from $1.3 million in August down $685k. In the update, IREN said the hit to AI revenue in September was due to Poolside capacity being re-contracted to new buyers throughout the month. The company says 7 deals have been closed since the Poolside contract ended and IREN now has 10 customers served since inception of the business. Additionally, there are now 1,896 GPUs in IREN's AI compute fleet which the company says will support $32m in annualized hardware profit. The reported margin on this AI service revenue - which appears to not include the price of the GPUs for some reason - is staggering. At 98% in each of the three months shown above, the profit margin on the electricity costs for AI Cloud services makes me highly skeptical of the sustainability of this revenue segment long term. When reported profits are this high, it's almost a certainty that it can't continue unimpeded by competitors in the quarters and years ahead. But beyond that, I think it's concerning that the Poolside contract has already ended given it was only just April when IREN was touting an upsized buy and extension from this very same client. That said, we're told that capacity is already contracted again. But I'll reiterate that as of today IREN is still very much at the mercy of Bitcoin's price for top line revenue. For quarter ended September, we can expect the company to report 94% of total revenue from Bitcoin mining. Thus, we still see exahash growth figures and guidance for as much as 50 EH/s in the future: Project Schedule (IREN) The other thing to consider is the project schedule for IREN's remaining MW capacity. There is currently 360 MW operating, an additional 550 MW under construction, and then another 1,400 MW projected for late 2026. The additional pipeline of over 1,000 MW has no timetable. This is where I would caution shareholders who may be extrapolating today's AI compute margin with tomorrow's capacity. Judging from the client churn we're already seeing, I suspect the more data center capacity there is, the less companies like IREN will be able to actually earn from each MW. Closing Thoughts If we do indeed expect AI applications to get to a level of profitability, which if OpenAi is any indication is still several years away, it will most likely have to come at the consumer level. If it does not, I suspect the application layer will simply have to cut costs; which figures to hit margins for compute capacity providers like IREN. From where I sit, this is all still a highly speculative space and IREN's core business remains mining Bitcoin. Given that, IREN goes as Bitcoin's price goes for now. I'm of the view that we'll see higher BTC prices between now and the end of the year. So I won't rule out higher share prices in IREN as well. However, I do think any spike in share price will be temporary and probably a good opportunity to sell. I'm downgrading IREN to hold today. I think dilution is going to continue to be an ongoing headwind for equity investors. The difference between IREN and several other BTC miners is any upside from higher coin prices is capped since the company has no HODL stack.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4726202-iren-stock-ai-optics-still-a-bitcoin-business-crypto-btcusd?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34577282.jpeg

The gap is rising even more on Friday as MSTR shares jump 11% versus bitcoin's 3% advance.  MicroStrategy increased its ""Bitcoin Yield"" KPI to 5.1% from 4.4% in Q2 2024.  The company's aggressive accumulation strategy means the premium could continue for the longer term.  Disclosure: The author of this story owns shares in MicroStrategy (MSTR).  Shares of self-described Bitcoin Development Company MicroStrategy (MSTR) continue to advance relative to the price of bitcoin {{BTC}}, expanding the premium to the value of its holdings to the highest level in more than three years.  The company's so-called net asset value (NAV) premium is calculated by dividing MSTR's market capitalization by the value of its bitcoin stack, and it has risen to roughly 2.5, according to MSTR-tracker, the highest level since February 2021. Prior to the Friday market opening in the U.S., MicroStrategy had a market cap of around $37.14 billion, with its 252,220 BTC valued at $15.1 billion.  In the hours since, that premium has expanded further, with MSTR soaring 11% to a 25-year high, far outpacing bitcoin's 3% gain.  Not only is the NAV multiple at its highest level for years, but dividing the MicroStrategy stock price by the bitcoin price totals 0.0030. That's the highest ratio since the company's adoption of bitcoin started in August 2020.  MicroStrategy has outperformed bitcoin in 2024  When the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched on Jan. 11, there was much deliberation beforehand about how bitcoin-related equities, such as MicroStrategy, would perform due to the huge expectations of the ETFs.  However, since the launch of the ETFs, MicroStrategy stock has gained more than 240%, making a new record high on Oct. 8. That's about 8 times better than the performance of bitcoin, which is lower by 16% since hitting its own record all the way back in March.  Explaining the premium  Since adopting bitcoin as a balance sheet asset in August 2020, MicroStrategy has aggressively leveraged financial instruments such as at-the-market equity offerings (ATM) and convertible senior notes to raise capital to steadily boost its coin stash. As a result, the bitcoin per share has continued to increase, which is accretive for shareholders.  Bitcoin per share can be defined as the amount of bitcoin that each outstanding share of MicroStrategy equates to, which is currently at 0.0012.  In both instances, equity financing and debt financing involve shareholder dilution. The share count for debt financing increases once the convertible debt is converted into equity. Meanwhile, equity offerings involve shareholder dilution each time shares are sold through the ATM program. However, the important part is whether the bitcoin holdings can grow faster than the shareholder dilution, and that's been the case over the last four years.  A new key performance indicator (KPI) coined by MicroStrategy is the ""Bitcoin Yield,"" which the company defines as the percent change period-to-period of the ratio between the company’s bitcoin holdings and its Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding."" This metric increased to 5.1% for the second quarter, up from 4.4% three months earlier.  With MicroStrategy showing no signs of stopping this aggressive accumulation strategy and investors seeking greater returns than holding bitcoin itself, the NAV premium could in theory continue over a long period.

With the entire crypto market anticipating a potential rally, Ethereum investors carefully watch for any signs of strength within the network. However, growing concerns about a possible deeper correction loom over the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Break Yearly Highs ‘Any Moment Now’ – Crypto Analyst Key metrics from IntoTheBlock indicate that if Ethereum breaks below the $2,300 level, a significant sell-off could follow, increasing pressure on the price. This has created a tense atmosphere among traders and investors as they wait for a clear confirmation that Ethereum can hold strong above this critical support level. As the broader market experiences uncertainty, Ethereum’s performance in the coming days will likely determine its trajectory. Investors are hoping for bullish momentum, but many remain cautious, aware of the risks that a drop below $2,300 could trigger. The next few days will be critical in shaping Ethereum’s future price action. Ethereum Price Testing Crucial Demand Ethereum is at a crucial turning point as its price remains indecisive, hovering between two significant levels that could result in substantial gains or losses once the trend becomes clear. Currently trading in a tight range, ETH investors and analysts carefully observe key support and resistance areas. Top analyst and investor Ali recently shared important data from IntoTheBlock on X, highlighting the critical nature of the $2,300 support level for Ethereum. According to the report, around 2.4 million addresses purchased approximately 52.6 million ETH around this level. This makes $2,300 a significant demand zone that, if breached, could trigger a wave of selling as investors look to protect their portfolios and minimize losses. If Ethereum holds above this critical support, the sentiment around ETH could shift toward a more positive outlook. Traders and investors may gain confidence, leading to a potential rally. Ali’s analysis underlines the importance of the coming days in shaping Ethereum’s price action. Related Reading: Dogecoin Targets $0.11 As Short-Term Traders Fuel DOGE Price – Details Ethereum’s performance at the $2,300 level will likely determine its short-term future, either as a foundation for gains or a trigger for deeper corrections. ETH Technical Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,420, following a 3% rebound from the lower demand zone around $2,330. Despite the recent recovery, the price remains under 2% away from the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $2,467 and about 3% away from the 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,495. These moving averages are critical resistance levels for ETH in the short term. Ethereum must break above the 200 MA and EMA and target resistance levels above $2,500 to push the price higher. A clear breakout above could open the door for further gains, with investors looking for signs of sustained momentum. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Signals Massive Gains Ahead – 2021 Rally Could Repeat However, if Ethereum fails to reclaim both indicators in the coming sessions, the risk of a deeper correction increases.

Recent earnings reports showed revenue declines and net losses, missing consensus estimates and highlighting potential long-term growth concerns. Despite challenges, positive factors include strong growth in subscription revenue and substantial bitcoin holdings valued at nearly $14.3 billion. MSTR is testing major resistance levels; a break above $200 could signal a bullish breakout, but downside risks remain if key support levels fail. When I last wrote about MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) on May 17th with "" MicroStrategy: Dangerous Stock, Sell All Rallies "", the stock was in the process of making forceful moves in the bullish direction, and share prices had experienced massive gains of nearly 56.9% in just 16 days. Given the stock's obvious history of substantial downturns following surging price rallies, I felt that the balance of the evidence (from a risk-reward perspective) warranted a ""strong sell"" rating for the stock. After moving to new highs at $174 per share, the stock quickly reversed in the downward direction and lost over -30.86% over the next seven weeks: MSTR: Price Behavior Shows Major Declines (Income Generator via TradingView) Interestingly, very similar price moves in MSTR share prices had occurred a short time prior and then again a short time later. Specifically, the stock dropped by -49.5% during the trading period spanning from March 27th to May 1st, and the stock dropped by -44.29% during the trading period spanning from July 29th to August 5th. Clearly, this pattern of behavior suggests that the stock has recorded a broad inability to maintain rallying price moves for significant periods of time and this outlook largely formed the basis for my original assertions that a bearish stance should be adopted whenever MSTR generates substantial rallies during relatively short time frames. MSTR: Prior Failures to Sustain Bullish Rallies (Income Generator via TradingView) With all of this in mind, it is probably not difficult to understand why some investors might consider MSTR stock to be a highly volatile asset that may not be suitable for all investment portfolio types. Furthermore, MicroStrategy's most recent earnings release left quite a lot to be desired, as the company reported revenue declines of -7% (at $111.4 million) and net losses of $102.6 million (which marked a sizable turnaround from the net income figure of $22.2 million that was recorded during the same period a year earlier). Additionally, the positive Q2-2023 EPS figure of $1.68 also reversed sharply to show losses of $5.74 per share in Q2-2024. Q2 2024 Earnings Figures (MicroStrategy Earnings Presentation) Overall, MicroStrategy's quarterly revenue figure fell short of consensus estimates of $122 million by nearly -9%, and longer-term revenue projections for the company indicate annualized growth rates of just 4.2% over the next three-year period (even while consensus estimates for the software technology sector in the United States call for annualized growth rates of roughly 12% during the same period of time). According to Phong Le, MicroStrategy CEO, there were several positives that should also be noted: We are extremely optimistic with the improved understanding of bitcoin and the increasing support for the ecosystem from bipartisan politicians and institutions... We also continue to see increased global adoption of our cloud-powered BI and AI software, achieving another quarter of strong double-digit growth in both subscription revenue and subscription billings. Most important, however, are the company's bitcoin holdings, which rose to 226,500 (purchased at an average price of just over $36,800 per coin). With BTC-USD currently trading at a valuation of $63,126.50, this means MicroStrategy's current holdings are worth just under $14.3 billion: MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings (MicroStrategy Earnings Presentation) Additionally, MicroStrategy's total bitcoin holdings accumulated at a rate that was faster than the assumed diluted share count (5.6% versus 1.8%): MicroStrategy: Use of Leverage (MicroStrategy Earnings Presentation) On the daily time frames, it has become quite clear that the market has responded favorably to these developments, and MSTR is currently in the process of testing major long-term resistance levels. Specifically, the stock's recent rallies from the September 6th lows of $113.69 have created a severe turn in upside share price momentum that has generated near-term highs of $198.49. At this stage, the real question will be whether or not the recent upsurge in share price momentum will lead to a convincing longer-term break of the stock's all-time highs near $200. Of course, this is a stock that has generally been characterized as an asset that is highly volatile and often susceptible to false breakouts (in both bullish and bearish directions). So, it must be understood that even if we do see share prices touch new highs above the $200 mark, we could still be in store for violent downside reversals that have the potential to take investors off-guard. MSTR: Near-Term Resistance Zone (Income Generator via TradingView) Thus far, we have already seen a bit of a rejection from these psychological levels near $200 per share. Specifically, a triple-top resistance area has formed near $198.50 and the most recent rejection from this area has sent the stock to test near-term lows of $186.80 (on October 9th). Interestingly, this price low aligns quite closely with the prior $185.32 support zone and, if the stock is able to form a base in this area, it seems quite likely that the stock will be able to break to new all-time highs relatively soon. In order to reverse this bullish outlook, I would need to see share prices break below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the upward trending move from the September 6th lows (at $113.77) to the October 8th highs (near $198.50), which is located just above the $179 level. If this support zone is breached to the downside, I would start to adopt a consolidative (sideways, neutral) outlook and wait for the stock to show more evidence that share prices are actually establishing a sustainable base. MSTR: Critical Downside Price Levels (Income Generator via TradingView) From there, I would view a further downside break of the $156.70 level (which is the 50% retracement of the aforementioned price move) as more of a significant warning sign, suggesting that this most recent uptrend is actually in significant danger of developing a more heavily bearish reversal. However, the stochastic indicator reading has recently rolled over out of overbought territory, so it seems unlikely at the moment that this negative outlook is going to be the most probable outcome. MSTR: Daily Stochastic Indicator Readings (Income Generator via TradingView) Finally, I think it is constructive to look at the indicator readings on the daily time frames because here we can see that MSTR is on the verge of moving out of overbought territory. Of course, we are not quite there yet, but once these overbought conditions resolve themselves, I think it will be much easier for the stock to form a sustainable base and make another push above the $200 mark. For the most part, I try not to focus on psychological price levels unless there are specific chart signals that add validity to those price regions. In this case, the formation of a triple-top resistance zone right below this level suggests that further moves to the topside could be quite forceful if this resistance is broken. As long as investors understand the broader history of this stock (and its prior tendencies in failing to maintain significant rallies), I do think that MSTR is a stock to consider because we might be on the verge of a major bullish breakout. As always, it will be critically important to monitor trend activity in BTC-USD, as well. Any sizable bearish trending move in this cryptocurrency pair should weigh heavily on MSTR and potentially send the stock through my reversal pivot point at $156.70.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4726176-microstrategy-major-breakout-ahead-rating-upgrade-mstr-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34575587.jpeg

There has also been a continued push toward building a spot crypto ETF hierarchy. While some analysts and investors love cryptocurrencies in an ETF wrapper, there’s just not broad mainstream demand beyond bitcoin. That doesn’t mean there won’t be demand in the future. There are important issues to address before demand becomes more widespread. Crypto ETF innovation hasn’t stopped. Since the launch of spot ether ETFs this summer, there have been launches reviving the crypto equity universe (e.g., SPDR Galaxy Digital Assets ETFs). There has also been a continued push toward building a spot crypto ETF hierarchy. Issuers like VanEck and 21Shares have filed for spot Solana ETFs. More recently, and Bitwise has filed for a spot XRP ETF. Neither Solana nor XRP have a clear path ahead in the near term (more on that later). But the big question is, do mainstream investors want more crypto, or does interest end with spot bitcoin ETFs? While some analysts and investors love cryptocurrencies in an ETF wrapper (including myself), there’s just not broad mainstream demand beyond bitcoin. That doesn’t mean there won’t be demand in the future. But right now, there are more important issues to address before demand becomes more widespread. First, let’s look at some of the roadblocks for broader crypto adoption (beyond bitcoin). 1. Are clients ACTUALLY interested in crypto? The spot bitcoin ETF launch was almost too good to be true. There was a lot of uncertainty, there was drama (fake SEC tweet), there was an unprecedented race among issuers. All of this resulted in a record-breaking launch. Many of us thought this launch would help bring crypto into the mainstream and encourage adoption. But by the spot ether ETF launch in July, we were deep in the summer doldrums. Demand for these products was significantly muted compared to their spot bitcoin counterparts. Of course, this was expected to an extent - bitcoin has significantly more market cap than ether. But ether is the silver to bitcoin’s gold. And if the “silver” of the crypto world has not caught on in the ETF universe, it’s difficult to predict what demand we’ll see for other cryptocurrencies (i.e., Solana, XRP). The issue is that we’re confusing crypto investors with mainstream retail investors. The two groups have some crossover but aren’t necessarily the same. On one hand, seasoned crypto investors and analysts see the benefit of investing in multiple cryptocurrencies - not just bitcoin. But they usually like direct investment. The ETF wrapper, while a game changer, is a trade-off for those direct investment characteristics - security, privacy, decentralization - that cryptocurrencies are known for. And unlike the old-school crypto investor, newer investors may be satisfied with a simpler approach to cryptocurrency investing (e.g., investing in just bitcoin ETFs). Bitcoin and ether have two very different use cases. Yet, it is very easy to use bitcoin as a “just for fun” investment without fully diversifying their crypto allocation. Products from large issuers like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) were able to see $21 billion and $10 billion, respectively, in net inflows YTD. But their spot ether counterparts have seen only $1.2 billion and $450 million in net inflows YTD, respectively. 2. Are advisors WILLING to allocate to crypto? Given a niche portion of clients interested in crypto ETFs, the next step is making sure advisors are also open to conversation. The survey results shown below are important, because 64% of advisors surveyed - that’s almost two-thirds of advisors - are neutral to negative on cryptocurrencies. To further support this, 13F data filing show that most investors who own spot crypto products are self-directed investors - not those who invest through an advisor. (13Fs are filed by institutional investors including banks, broker-dealers, investment advisors, pension funds, and corporations. These are filed quarterly to disclose holdings.) According to this data, 82% of shares held of iShares’ IBIT and 75% of shares held of the Fidelity’s FBTC are by investors who do not file 13Fs (i.e., mostly self-directed clients). This goes against what we thought in the beginning - that the launch of these products would bring a new wave of mainstream investors and their advisors. Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut answer to getting advisors more interested in this asset class. Education - not just for investors, but also focused on advisors - will be the primary solution. Education takes time but should become easier as time passes and ease acceptance among both clients and advisors. 3. CAN advisors allocate to crypto? Assuming both clients and advisors are interested, there are still some barriers to investing. Many large brokerage firms and asset managers do not allow investment in crypto, including crypto ETFs. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers, has stated on its website that it does not allow crypto ETFs on its platform because it does “not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios.” Similarly, Edward Jones released guidance stating that “cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and [they]don’t offer a way to purchase or hold cryptocurrencies,” including crypto funds. While Morgan Stanley recently started allowing its financial advisors to offer bitcoin ETFs, there is a significant caveat. They can only offer the two largest funds - BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. And these can only be offered to clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million with aggressive risk tolerance. These are likely the most difficult barriers to overcome. That’s because they can’t simply be solved by education, but persistent investor and advisor demand should reduce these barriers over time. Looking Forward Crypto ETFs have come a long way. And I still believe the industry has room to move forward. But we need to address education to encourage adoption and bridge the gap between advisors and their clients for bitcoin and beyond. Looking forward, the approval timeline for Solana products has already been stalled. And the SEC is still in the middle of legal security classification issues with XRP. On top of this, there is very little investor demand. So issuers aren’t racing to file for products this time around. Education can boost investor and advisor interest. But a better crypto regulatory is also required to make issuers, brokerages, and exchanges more comfortable with these products. These issues need to be tackled so that we can move forward with launches like Solana or XRP. Disclosure: © VettaFi LLC 2024. All rights reserved.

42407388,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGx4O,1728648060,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Trims Thursday's Inflation-Led Losses,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,908.58 +1.34%  Bitcoin (BTC): $61,001.69 -0.04%  Ether (ETH): $2,410.36 +0.74%  S&P 500: 5,780.05 -0.21%  Gold: $2,640.19 +0.28%  Nikkei 225: 39,605.80 +0.57%  Top Stories  Following its 4% slide during U.S. hours on Thursday, bitcoin regained some ground to trade above $61,000 on Friday. BTC fell to $59,000 following a U.S. CPI report that showed hotter-than-expected inflation in September, seemingly putting paid to hopes of another 50 basis-point interest-rate cut by the Fed next month. The bounce left BTC about 0.25% higher than 24 hours ago. The broader digital asset market showed stronger gains of 1.65%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. XRP and DOGE led the way, adding around 2.5% and 2% respectively.  Donald Trump's odds of a return to the White House surged to a more than two-month high on Polymarket. Traders are giving the former president a 55.8% shot versus Vice President Kamala Harris' 43.8% on the prediction market site, where more than $1.6 billion has been wagered on the November election. Trump's chances have risen to levels last seen days after President Joe Biden said he wouldn't seek reelection, clearing the way for Harris to take over. Another prediction market, Kalshi, which just recently won permission to list contracts based on U.S. elections, also shows Trump in the lead over Harris: 52% to 48%.  Crypto exchange Bitnomial filed suit against the SEC, saying the regulator overextended its jurisdiction in seeking to regulate a proposed XRP futures contract together with the CFTC. In a Thursday filing with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the company said the futures fall solely in the CFTC's remit and the SEC's involvement would add significantly to the company's regulatory burden. The exchange self-certified that the XRP futures did not violate the CFTC's regulations on Aug. 9, it said. ""Bitnomial disagrees with the SEC’s view that XRP is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, and that XRP Futures are thus security futures,"" it said in the filing.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price performance months after 2012, 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections.  Bitcoin has seen an average gain of over 4,000% in 400 days after elections.  ""Past U.S. election events have aligned well with both Bitcoin Halving events and U.S. business cycle troughs, which are likely the main factors behind Bitcoin's stellar performance over the past 3 election cycles in 2012, 2016 and 2020. We have a similar alignment in this cycle,"" analysts at ETC Group said in a report.

Over 100% increase in value drove the token’s market capitalization above $5 billion. But as is always the case with cryptocurrencies, what rises must fall at least momentarily. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Cardano Surges In Strength—Now 10x More Powerful, Analyst Says The coin’s surge is exhibiting indications of stalling after weeks of increasing momentum. Traders are now closely observing what can happen next for this once-red-hot asset. According to crypto price prediction site CoinCheckup, SUI is selling 220% below its expected price for next month, suggesting a possible undervaluation. Price Slips And Declining Market Activity SUI was trading at $1.84 at press time after losing 5% of its value within only 24 hours. Based on CoinMarketCap, trading volumes have likewise dropped by 4%. This decline in activity suggests, at least for the time being, a decreasing interest in the token. The technical signs hardly seem much better. Tracking money flow into and out of an asset, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has also been on a downward slope in the last seven days. This is an indication that money is fleeing SUI, usually leading to issues for price stability. Moreover, the CMF has entered negative territory, suggesting that purchasing interest is currently subordinated to selling pressure. SUI: Slowing Momentum But Potential Bounce The token started to sell off as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped below a key signal line, indicating declining momentum. Still, there is a positive aspect here. Should the RSI show a positive turn once more, it may indicate a buying chance for those who think SUI has long-term promise. If selling keeps on, analysts say SUI might test support at $1.70; this might not be a negative outcome. Strong support levels draw buyers who see value at lower levels, thereby acting as a basis for the price to increase once again. SUI will have to barrel its way past the resistance at $2, a fundamental psychological and technical barrier, if it is to break out from its present downturn. Cooling Interest Meanwhile, SUI, which has lately been seeing explosive growth, also seem to be cooling off. From an all-time high of $560 million to $450 million, open interest declined 10% over the past 24 hours. This implies that traders are closing positions as excitement declines, thus helping to explain the general sell pressure on the coin. Some traders would see the drop in open interest as a sign of opportunity even with this cooling off. Prices falling always mean that buyers will re-enter the market, particularly if they feel SUI is underpriced.

42407420,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZH4xk,1728645212,"Bitcoin on Track for Record Sideways Action, With Eyes on November Elections as Bullish Catalyst","Bitcoin is nearing the record for the longest sideways market range post-halving, currently at 285 days since the last halving in April.  Factors like U.S. election uncertainty, rising U.S. Treasury yields, and the extension of Mt. Gox's repayment deadline to October 2025 are contributing to Bitcoin's lackluster price action.  Historically, October is bullish for Bitcoin, particularly its second half.  Bitcoin is two weeks away from marking its longest-ever period in a sideways market range since its April halving, demoralizing bulls positioned for a bigger rally in the final quarter of this year.  “285 days have passed since the bitcoin halving,” CryptoQuant founder Ki Young-Ju said in an X post Friday. “If there is no bull market in 14 days, this will mark the longest sideways post-halving in history.”  Halvings happen about every four years and decrease the block rewards to miners. Bitcoin halving has always been associated with bull rallies, with asset prices increasing by several hundred percent in the months following previous events.  Prices tend to rise with fewer new bitcoin in the open market as long as demand remains constant or increases. BTC jumped above $73,000 to new lifetime highs ahead of the April 14 halving - with some targeting a continued rally to as high as $160,000 by the end of this year. However, prices have largely fluctuated in the $59,000 to $65,000 range since then, nearing a 300-day sideways action record from 2016.  Bitcoin's boring price action, characterized by continued accumulation by small investors, is being attributed to several reasons, including the U.S. election uncertainty and renewed uptick in the U.S. Treasury yields.  “The higher bond yield move and SPX at record highs are helping to push USD higher, but it is coming at the expense of crypto, where BTC is back to hovering at around the 60k level again,” shared Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk on Friday.  “Finally, defunct Mt. Gox's fresh announcement that it has extended its repayment deadline by a year to Oct 2025 might help to alleviate some supply pressures in the short-run, but it appears that BTC will be in a holding pattern here heading into the final weeks of the election,” Fan added.  Republican candidate Donald Trump is viewed as crypto friendly. He is associated with the new decentralized finance project World Liberty Finance, while the Democratic party is considered less friendly toward the market. A Republican victory is widely expected to fuel a higher Bitcoin move.  Markets often enter a sideways phase where traders and investors reassess their positions, leading to a balance between buying and selling pressures.  Bitcoin would need to break and remain above the $69,000 level to be considered a bullish breakout above the current range, as per CoinDesk market analyst Omkar Godbole. A breakout would mean a resumption of the broader uptrend from October 2023 lows and shift focus to $100,000, a level anticipated by options traders.  Sideways movement can be interpreted as periods of accumulation (where investors slowly buy up supply without moving the price much) or distribution (where they sell off their holdings in a similar controlled manner). This typically leads to a period of high volatility.  Bitcoin is coming out of a seasonally bearish period of August and Septermber, where investors do not make big moves, to a historically bullish October. A CoinDesk analysis shows most gains in October arise in the second half of the month - usually after October 16.  But market strains remain. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this week charged multiple market-making and trading firms on consecutive days - igniting debate on whether the crypto market could face more trouble in the weeks before the November elections.

The case concerns an XRP futures contract that's already regulated by the CFTC.  Crypto exchange Bitnomial filed a suit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying the regulator overextended its jurisdiction in seeking to regulate a proposed XRP futures contract together with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  ""The SEC asserted that XRP Futures are security futures, which are subject to joint SEC and CFTC jurisdiction (unlike non-security futures which are subject only to the CFTC’s exclusive jurisdiction),"" the company said in a Thursday filing with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. ""The SEC further asserted that Bitnomial is required to comply with a host of additional SEC requirements before listing XRP Futures, including the significant task of registering as a national securities exchange ('NSE') and submitting to the SEC’s jurisdiction.""  In the filing the company said the futures fall solely in the CFTC's remit and the SEC's involvement would add significantly to the company's regulatory burden. The exchange self-certified that the XRP futures did not violate the CFTC's regulations on Aug. 9, it said.  ""Bitnomial disagrees with the SEC’s view that XRP is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, and that XRP Futures are thus security futures,"" it said in the filing.  Bitnomial's case alleging SEC overreach follows a similar filing by Crypto.com on Tuesday. In that suit, the exchange said it was responding to a SEC warning that it was considering an enforcement action, and it was taking ""a warranted response to the SEC's regulation by enforcement regime which has hurt more than 50 million American crypto holders.""  The SEC has contended in the past that Ripple has violated securities laws by selling the XRP token.  In August a federal judge ruled that Ripple should pay $125 million after finding last year that the company had violated federal securities laws with its sale of XRP to institutional clients, but the judge said it selling XRP to retail clients through secondary markets didn't violate those laws. The penalty was a fraction of the $2 billion that the SEC sought and the regulator is now appealing the case.

The meme coin has caught the attention of analysts and traders, with mixed opinions about its next move. Some believe Dogecoin is preparing for a rally, while others suggest further declines could be ahead. Key data from IntoTheBlock highlights the importance of short-term traders in driving liquidity for meme coins like DOGE. This cohort of traders remains a significant source of activity, often influencing rapid price fluctuations. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Signals Massive Gains Ahead – 2021 Rally Could Repeat Dogecoin is holding strong above the critical $0.10 level, a key psychological support for the asset. If the price maintains momentum, the next bullish target is around $0.11, which could spark more excitement and buying interest in the market. As speculation continues, all eyes are on whether Dogecoin can sustain its recent strength or if it will face another wave of selling pressure. The coming days determine the meme coin’s direction in the weeks ahead. Dogecoin Price Driven By Speculation Dogecoin faces intense speculation as investors and analysts express differing views about its future price action. After several weeks of ups and downs, the meme coin has been subjected to massive volatility, reflecting the overall market’s erratic behavior. The uncertainty surrounding Dogecoin has led to heated debates about whether it will rally or continue to fall. Key data from IntoTheBlock reveals the pivotal role of short-term traders in driving meme coins, particularly Dogecoin. These tokens thrive on hype and speculative trading activity, and DOGE leads the pack with the highest number of active short-term traders. Over the past week, Dogecoin has seen approximately 113,000 short-term traders, underscoring its dominant position in the meme coin space. Interestingly, DEGEN, a much smaller token, has also attracted around 23,000 short-term traders—similar to Shiba Inu’s, despite DEGEN’s market cap being only 10% of Shiba Inu’s size. This highlights the speculative frenzy within the meme coin ecosystem, where even lesser-known assets garner significant trading activity. Most mid-sized meme coins, in comparison, show only around 4,000 active short-term traders, illustrating Dogecoin’s continued strength. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details Despite the speculative nature of these assets, Dogecoin’s ability to attract the most active traders signifies resilience and hints at a potential for future rallies, even amid broader market uncertainty. DOGE Holding Above $0.10 Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.108, testing the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) as resistance. Bulls aiming to maintain momentum must reclaim this key indicator to increase prices. The 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) also sits at $0.1088, just under 1% above the current price. This creates a crucial resistance zone for DOGE. A clear break above the 200 MA and 200 EMA and the psychological $0.11 mark would likely trigger a rally, pushing the price higher as bullish momentum takes hold. However, failure to reclaim these indicators could lead to a more significant correction. In this case, DOGE could face a drop to $0.088, a key lower demand level, signaling further downside in the coming days. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Testing $0.34 Support – On-Chain Data Suggests Price Consolidation As Dogecoin continues to test these levels, traders are closely watching for a decisive move that could indicate the next major trend, with the potential for a rally or further decline hinging on whether bulls can reclaim these moving averages and push beyond $0.11.

He has been unlawfully detained for over 220 days,"" a Binance spokesperson said in statement adding that the company is committed to working with the Nigerian government.  Gambaryan, the crypto exchange's head of financial crime compliance, has been detained in Nigeria since February. He has been in the notorious Kuje prison alongside the likes of terrorist group Boko Haram since fellow Binance employee Nadeem Anjarwalla escaped custody in March.  Alongside Binance, Gambaryan was charged with tax evasion and money laundering, though the tax charges were later dropped.  The court deferred making a decision on bail in September. Gambaryan's attorneys filed a new bail application, citing his deteriorating medical condition. One lawyer, Mark Mordi, told the court last month that the executive has needed surgery since July 18 and requires urgent assistance that cannot currently be provided in prison, Bloomberg reported.  During his time in prison Gambaryan has developed malaria, pneumonia and tonsillitis and suffers from complications tied to a herniated disc in his back, which left him in need of a wheelchair – though in a video from his last court appearance, Gambaryan did not have a wheelchair, and instead had to struggle on a single crutch.  ""It is completely unjust to deny someone in Tigran’s condition the opportunity to seek appropriate medical help and I just pray that when he is finally released that the damage he is suffering is not permanent,"" Tigran's wife Yuki Gamabryan said. ""I am exhausted and deeply disappointed, but I will continue fighting for my husband’s rightful freedom.""  Read more: 'Is Daddy on the Airplane?'

Alexander Nikolas Gierczyk alleges Olympus Peak is reneging on paying an extra amount he says he's owed because the bankruptcy payout is more than expected.  A California-based former customer of FTX is suing hedge fund Olympus Peak alleging that the firm's bankruptcy claims purchasing desk has withheld promised payments on a claim he sold to it.  In documents filed with the U.S. District Court Southern District Of New York, Alexander Nikolas Gierczyk says he agreed to sell a $1.59 million FTX bankruptcy claim at a 42% discount to Olympus Peak Trade Claims Opportunities Fund with an ""excess claim provision.""  The agreement provided that “if the Claim is ultimately allowed … in an amount that is greater than the Claim Amount, Buyer will purchase such Excess Claim Amount by paying … the Excess Claim Amount multiplied by the Purchase Rate.”  Gierczyk agreed to the sale only because ""the purchase agreement contained a clause that expressly gave him the right to receive additional recovery in the event his claim was paid above par through the bankruptcy proceedings,"" according to the filing.  Gierczyk's attorneys write in the filing that the most recent FTX disclosure statement says that claims similar his are estimated to receive as much as 146% of their value in distributions. But, they allege, Olympus Peak, ""made clear that they would not be fulfilling their end of the bargain.”  ""We disagree with your position that you have a retained any economic interest in the claim,” an Olympus Peak representative wrote to Gierczyk.  ""This lawsuit is entirely without merit and is based on a plain misreading of the parties’ contract,” Ariel Lavinbuk, a Partner at Kramer Levin, Olympus Peak's counsel, wrote to CoinDesk in response for a request for comment.

Derivative traders on decentralized exchanges see limited upside in ETH.  The bearish sentiment toward ether {{ETH}} remains pronounced relative to bitcoin {{BTC}} even as DeFi enthusiast Republican candidate Donald Trump extends his lead over Democrat rival Kamala Harris in prediction markets tied to the outcome of the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.  At press time, ether's 25-delta risk reversals for shorter and longer duration expiries were more negative than bitcoin's, according to data sources Amberdata and Deribit. That's a sign of stronger bearish sentiment toward the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, which dominates in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Risk reversals measure the premium required to hold a call option relative to a put. Negative values suggest a bias for put options, which reflect expectations of a price drop in the underlying asset.  Traders often use options to hedge their spot/futures market exposure. Therefore, a trader with a bullish spot/futures bet may buy a put option when expecting downside volatility. Both bitcoin and ether traders seem to be doing just that, with ether traders displaying a stronger inclination to mitigate potential downside risks.  The risk reversal for Oct. 11 ether options is -7.3%, while bitcoin's is -5.8%. A similar pattern is observed for expiries up to the end of October.  A curious pattern has emerged: While BTC risk reversals are positive for Nov. 8 and beyond, ether's don't turn bullish until late December. In other words, traders expect upside volatility in BTC once the election results are out on Nov. 8. Ether isn't expected to turn the corner until later.  DEX traders see limited upside in ETH  On the dominant decentralized exchange (DEX) Derive, Ethereum call options saw a 2.5:1 sell-to-buy ratio in September. The flow was much more balanced in bitcoin options.  The relatively greater interest in writing (selling) ether calls means traders do not foresee a notable upside volatility in the cryptocurrency.  ""The skew in ETH open interest, with nearly 2.5 times more calls sold than bought, suggests that traders see the upside as limited for now. This divergence between the two assets will be key to watch as we get closer to election day,"" Nick Forster, founder of Derive, told CoinDesk in an exclusive monthly report.  Trump's lead widens  Trump's odds of winning the election soared to a two-month high of 55.8% on prediction platform Polymarket, leaving Harris behind at 43.8%.  The popular narrative is that a potential Trump win would be positive for both BTC and DeFi. The perception likely stems from Trump's decision to debut DeFi protocol World Liberty Financial in September.  On Oct. 9, the protocol submitted a proposal on Aave to link the two projects, focused on providing stablecoin liquidity for ETH and WBTC and growing Aave's user base.  Still, some observers, including Standard Chartered, say a Trump victory would be better for Ethereum rival Solana, and Ethereum will prosper more under Harris' presidency.

34567065,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647408,1728633635,Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Top Analyst Predicts What’s Next For Crypto,"Crypto analyst Bob Loukas has released a new video analysis titled “No Bull.” In the video, Loukas delves into the current state of the Bitcoin market, addressing growing concerns about the possibility of a canceled bull run. Loukas begins by acknowledging the prolonged period of consolidation for the Bitcoin price. He senses that “there is now some fear creeping into the market,” partly due to factors such as the Bitcoin ETF being “out for quite some time” and the halving having “come and go,” without leading to significant upward price movement. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Loukas observes that while traditional markets are performing robustly—with “the stock market making all-time highs seemingly every week” and “even gold making big all-time highs”—Bitcoin continues to “languish,” and altcoins are “pretty much dying a slow death.” He notes that “the only thing out there that’s really working is the really speculative memecoins,” contributing to negative sentiment in the crypto space. However, he considers this development to be “kind of normal,” emphasizing that despite these challenges, Bitcoin remains “close to the all-time highs from the prior cycle.” Discussing the eight months of consolidation in Bitcoin’s price, Loukas interprets this period as a bullish sign. “Eight months of consolidation is actually pretty bullish if the timing is right in the four-year cycle. Sentiment is right, it’s been reset; fundamentals, macro, I think they all look right,” he states. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Path To $80,000 “Melt-Up” In Q4 2024 – Details Inside Loukas further highlights that the market is “23 months in” since the lows of the last cycle in November 2022, “just shy of a 24-month or 2-year anniversary of this cycle,” which is due to conclude around November-December 2026. He acknowledges the “quite a bit of fear that’s sort of crept into this market” following a “very bullish, very frothy period” from the ETF approval leak in September-October 2023 up to the peak in March 2024. One of the main fears, according to Loukas, is that Bitcoin made its last all-time high seven months ago in March, and since then, “we’ve been forming these lower highs on the monthly and also to some extent a lower low structure.” This has created anxiety among investors who “entered the market way too late, waiting for confirmation,” only to find themselves “locked out when the market went on this five straight months move,” without providing an opportunity to buy during a dip. He points out that many investors have “rolled into a bunch of altcoins in this later period that are now down 50, 60, 70%,” leading to a situation where, despite Bitcoin being “still up around 3x off the lows,” a lot of people feel they haven’t “extracted any sort of value out of this cycle” or have even “lost money over this period.” Loukas considers this scenario to be “quite normal from a cycle structure perspective.” He emphasizes that during this bullish phase, the market didn’t experience a “typical 30% decline at any given point,” with the “biggest declines” being “mostly time-based and were only around about 20% from peak to trough before making a new high.” This atypical behavior “threw a lot of people off” and “made it difficult for people to get in,” as they were “looking to buy on a dip which never really eventuated.” Loukas suggests that the current consolidation is a necessary phase to “completely reset sentiment in order to prepare for the next phase of this four-year cycle.” He finds it significant that Bitcoin is “sitting here 23 months, just around 20% or so off the all-time highs of the last four-year cycle high back in 2021,” which makes it feel “more primed for the next phase of the four-year cycle than anything else.” He also draws parallels with previous cycles, noting that from the cycle low in December 2018 to the first point where Bitcoin made a new high, “it took 23 months to get to the price four-year cycle high to exceed that.” Similar patterns were observed in earlier cycles, with timeframes of “around 25 months” and “around 22 months” to reach new all-time highs. In contrast, the current cycle achieved this milestone “in just 16 months, much sooner,” which he attributes largely to the ETF news that “forced buyers in earlier in the cycle than normal.” Loukas believes that this accelerated timeline has created a dynamic where “we now have to rotate a lot of coins,” allowing “a lot of whales, a lot of old-timers” to “unlock” and “exit and rotate,” while “institutional players, larger account players have been accumulating those coins in this period.” He views this as “a matter of time more than anything else,” interpreting the current period as a process where the market “ends up erasing all that bullish sentiment” from the previous phase, thus allowing “a complete separation from one phase of the cycle to this phase of the cycle”—essentially a “mid-cycle decline.” When Will BTC Price Break Out? Overall, Loukas remains largely optimistic: “So far in this four-year cycle, I see nothing that has changed that trajectory, nothing in the profile or the structure that tells me that this cycle is any different to the last cycles.” He cites several factors supporting his bullish outlook, including “massive inflows into Bitcoin, mostly institutional players,” and the absorption of large sell-offs by entities like “the German government” and “the US government,” which have not significantly impacted the price. Loukas emphasizes that “price is down only 20%; it’s held up well.” He also mentions that “the ETF is still there; it’s going to be pushed through the independent advisor channels,” and “the timing is there; the macro, the fundamentals are there.” Loukas is particularly excited about the cyclical patterns, noting that “the third year of each of these four cycles is where the magic happens.” He explains that “the first year surprises everybody, that makes up a lot of ground. The second year seems like it stalls because it consolidates that first year of gains. And the third year is the mania year. And right now, beginning next month, we have the mania year that is on deck.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hope: Mt. Gox Delays Repayment Plan Until October 2025 He predicts that “within the next 90 days… we’re going to break out of this consolidating range; we’re going to break to the upside.” Once this happens, he believes Bitcoin “isn’t going to look back,” anticipating a period that “may only see one or two red monthly candles and mostly green candles.” While he refrains from providing specific price targets, he acknowledges that reaching “somewhere between $120,000 and $180,000 also seems very reasonable.” Loukas emphasizes that the focus should be on “time and sentiment,” aiming for a move “in the range where prior cycles have peaked,” which has been “very consistent at around month 35 since the last low.” This timing would place the projected peak around “October of 2025,” giving “another 12 months to an expected or projected peak.” He notes that this is not set in stone and that the peak could come “three, four, five months earlier,” as market movements “can come in many different flavors.” Turning to the immediate future, Loukas admits that the next two months are “a little murky,” with “a lot of factors still at play right now.” He brings up the upcoming US election on November 4th, mentioning that “Trump and the GOP have really been pushing crypto and Bitcoin,” and that “the market is certainly going to respond very, very favorably to an election win by the GOP purely because of their stance on crypto.” However, he clarifies that he doesn’t think “it matters one bit” who wins, as Bitcoin has thrived even when “governments have been very hostile towards it.” Loukas speculates that the market might “trend sideways into that period in November,” and that a significant move might not occur until after the election concludes. He suggests that “we still have around three to four weeks of some trending sideways action,” and he would be “highly surprised if this market can push into the $70,000s before the election here in the US.” At press time, BTC traded at $60,699.

Gox Delays Repayment Plan Until October 2025,"In a development that could offer relief for Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto ecosystem, Mt. Gox, the defunct cryptocurrency exchange that was hacked in 2014, has announced a significant delay in its repayment plan for affected creditors. Originally set for October 31, 2024, the new deadline for repayments has been pushed to October 31, 2025. Mt. Gox Trustee Announces New Repayment Timeline This delay is particularly notable given that the repayment of approximately 200,000 BTC to creditors could have exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Had the repayments proceeded as scheduled, there was concern that many affected investors might liquidate their holdings en masse, potentially exacerbating Bitcoin’s existing downtrend and leading to a sharp price decline. Related Reading: SEC Strikes Again: Cumberland DRW Charged For ‘Unregistered Crypto Operations’ In a statement released on Thursday, the Rehabilitation Trustee outlined the current status of the repayment efforts. It noted that while significant progress has been made in processing repayments, many creditors have yet to receive their funds due to incomplete procedures or issues encountered during the repayment process. The Trustee stated: With the exception of certain types of repayments, the Rehabilitation Trustee has largely completed the Base Repayment, Early Lump-Sum Repayment, and Intermediate Repayment for rehabilitation creditors who have completed the necessary procedures. However, the statement highlighted that a considerable number of rehabilitation creditors still await their repayments. In light of these challenges, and with permission from the court, the Trustee determined it was in the best interest of all parties to extend the deadline for repayments. Key Levels To Watch For Bitcoin Amid Ongoing Fluctuations Despite recent optimism surrounding the Bitcoin market, the cryptocurrency has once again fallen below the critical $60,000 mark. This decline follows a brief uptrend triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut interest rates on September 18, which initially boosted confidence among crypto investors. Bitcoin had rallied to approximately $66,500 on September 27, marking its best September performance in over a decade. However, the cryptocurrency has since faced a sell-off, resulting in losses exceeding 2% in the last 24 hours and nearly 9% over the past two weeks. Related Reading: XRP Could Surge To $60 Overnight Using SWIFT Model, Expert Says Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has pointed out that Bitcoin is currently down around 6% for October. Historically, the cryptocurrency has experienced downturns in October only twice: in 2014, when it fell by 12.95%, and in 2018, with a decline of 3.83%. Both years were characterized by bear market conditions. With the current year being a Halving year—an event that historically has led to price increases—there is a prevailing sentiment that Bitcoin may avoid a negative monthly close this October, according to Rekt’s analysis. Rekt Capital also noted that Bitcoin is currently testing the Weekly Re-Accumulation Range Low, which is around $60,600. This level serves as crucial support, and maintaining a weekly close above it could set the stage for a potential upward movement. Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to hold this support, the analyst warns that it could lead to further declines, potentially pushing the price below $55,000. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $59,650, as seen in the daily BTC/USDT chart below.

42407405,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZH4NN,1728621623,Trump-Themed PoliFi Tokens Buck Bitcoin Downtrend as China Stimulus Hopes Return,"Trump-themed PoliFi tokens outperformed a slow market this week as the Republican candidate pulled ahead of Kamala Harris on Polymarket.  Crypto traders in Asia are eagerly awaiting Beijing's next moves as the People's Bank of China (PBoC) prepares to role out more stimulus.  Donald Trump-themed Political Finance (PoliFi) tokens bucked low volatility in bitcoin and the broader crypto market this week as the Republican presidential candidate's chances of winning the election surged to a two-month high on Polymarket.  Bitcoin slid over 4% in U.S. hours Thursday, before recovering in Asian morning hours Friday, now trading above $60K, as renewed regulatory fears plagued the market.  A re-acceleration in inflation pressure in September initially sent markets lower, with majors such as ether (ETH) and dogecoin (DOGE) falling as much as 6%.  But Trump-themed MAGA, MAGA HAT, and the Solana-based TREMP are all up double digits this week, with MAGA, the first and largest of them, up 55% on-week with a market cap moving past $200 million, while MAGA HAT is up $102% while TREMP is up 93%.  PoliFi is a cohort of tokens and memecoins that gained traction earlier this year, allowing communities and traders to speculate on the rise or fall of political figures using markets.  Trump's odds of winning the U.S. presidential election have surged to a more than two-month high on the leading prediction market, Polymarket.  As of Friday, traders are giving the former president a 55.8% shot versus Vice President Kamala Harris' 43.8%, according to pricing on Polymarket, where more than $1.6 billion has been wagered on the November election.  However, some market watchers await broader economic data before placing larger bets.  “A rebound in Trump's election odds has failed to elevate sentiment higher, and the market could be focused on how much of the income release of the FTX creditor claims will be reinvested back into crypto,” shared Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.  Elsewhere in crypto, Uniswap's native token {{UNI}} is up 10% as the market responds positively to the decentralized exchange (DEX) rolling out its own Layer-2 network built on optimism.  Meanwhile, the CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index tracking the performance of the largest digital assets, has been flat, up only 0.5%.  Renewed China Stimulus Hopes  Traders might wait to see how far the Chinese government goes with stimulus measures before making moves.  Bloomberg reported that market participants in China expect $283 billion (2 trillion yuan) in fresh fiscal stimulus as early as this weekend.  Elsewhere in China, the PBoC has begun to roll out a $70.6 billion fund called the Securities, Funds, and Insurance Companies Swap Facility, Caixin reported, which will allow financial institutions to pledge bonds, ETFs, and specific stock holdings to the PBoC in exchange for liquid assets like government bonds, which they can use to secure additional financing for stock purchases as a form of market stabilization.  However, does any of this matter for crypto investors eager to see BTC hit an all-time high? Maybe not.  A paper from BCA Research suggests that while China’s recent major stimulus has sparked rallies in stocks and risk assets like bitcoin, CoinDesk reported earlier, it may not have lasting effects, as the new credit flow, or ""credit impulse,"" is too low to drive a strong economic boost similar to past cycles like in 2015.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/11/trump-themed-polifi-tokens-buck-bitcoin-downtrend-as-china-stimulus-hopes-return,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a07c4d783483d7a9fa71d171a3bc312151cf35b-1283x722.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price is trading below $2,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,420 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must stay above the $2,350 support level to start decent increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Aims Upside Break Ethereum price failed to start a fresh increase above the $2,450 resistance zone. ETH remained in a bearish zone like Bitcoin and traded below the $2,365 support zone. There was also a move below the $2,350 level. The price tested the $2,320 support zone.

The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,468 swing high to the $2,329 low. A clear move above the $2,420 resistance might send the price toward the $2,450 resistance. An upside break above the $2,420 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,500 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,550 level or $2,560. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,420 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,380 level. The first major support sits near the $2,350 zone.

As ADA’s price falls 2.9%, some analysts warn of the next key level to watch out for. Related Reading: Worldcoin Drops 6% Amid Alameda Research 1.5 Million Token Sale, Will WLD Price Hold? Charles Hoskinson Defends Cardano On Thursday, Charles Hoskinson addressed the adverse response towards Cardano in an X post. Hoskinson noted that the crypto community’s sentiment about the project has lately been more negative than usual. However, he argued that Twitter’s sentiment change isn’t a reflection of the project failing “but rather the desired result of Voltaire.” Cardano’s “Voltaire” era is set to turn the network into “the most advanced blockchain governance system,” focusing on decentralized governance and its future sustainability. Hoskinson believes that Cardano’s collaborative efforts and the transparency of the network is what sets it apart from the rest of the crypto space. “It’s why we are loathed by a lot of others. Their backroom deals and dirty tricks can’t be hidden because there is no one to ask to do it under the table,” he added. In the post, the project’s founder also underscored Cardano’s “passion” for integrity and long-term vision for growth and progress: Short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout have no role or place here. That’s the difference that makes a difference. Lastly, Hoskinson remarked that the project is not dying but “thriving and growing.” He that ADA is one of the last cryptocurrencies still wanting to be a real crypto instead of “the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go up preferences.” ADA Could See A 10% Drop Soon The crypto community reacted to Hoskinson’s message, with many arguing that, regardless of the developments, the Network’s “lack of volume” and “limited” ecosystem growth remains a problem for its community. Meanwhile, part of ADA’s community agreed with Hoskinson, concurring that “it is the only chain that has truly built what I can only see as the groundwork to deliver on the promise of crypto.” Despite the ongoing criticism, some market watchers remain bullish about ADA’s future price action. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello recently predicted that the cryptocurrency will “easily” reclaim the $1 mark before year’s end. To Gambardello, the exponential surge “could happen fast” and leave many “flabbergasted.” Additionally, he stated that after the 200% surge, ADA’s potential targets of $5 and $10 would “look more realistic.” Related Reading: Experts Discuss What Made Solana Memecoins The Cycle’s Top Narrative Conversely, crypto analyst Sebastian warned about a key level to watch for following ADA’s recent performance. Earlier this week, the analyst highlighted that ADA showed signs of a breakout after retesting the trendline it had recently broken above $0.35. However, the cryptocurrency’s price dropped 2.9% in the last 24 hours, falling below the $0.34 mark. The analyst signaled that ADA must hold the current levels as failing to bounce from the $0.335 level could send the token to a retest of the $0.30 support level. As of this writing, ADA is trading at $0.337, a 1.95% and 2% decline in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

In a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst explained that Bitcoin is currently in a high open interest zone, having exceeded the critical $18 billion level. Historically, when open interest levels reached this point, major corrections followed. The analyst mentioned that the current market sentiment appears divided, noting: The market seems indecisive in many aspects, with some believing that the next big upside move is on the horizon, while others think BTC’s downward trend remains strong. A common belief is that BTC may need a final shakeout before surging to a new all-time high (ATH). Aytekin added that funding rates, though slightly above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), suggest that long traders are still dominant. However, significant price corrections in the past often occurred when funding rates turned negative, which hasn’t happened yet. Aytekin concluded that, while a final shakeout might occur, the depth of the correction may not be as severe given the relatively moderate funding rates. BTC Price Outlook As Bitcoin has struggled to break through key resistance levels, its recent price action reflects ongoing market indecision. Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin maintained stability above the $60,000 mark, but failed to make a major move to reclaim $70,000. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has slipped by 2.9%, currently trading at $60,485. This decline follows the asset’s brief surge to $63,774 earlier in the week, which sparked optimism for a possible move toward the $65,000 and then $70,000 mark. Prominent crypto analyst Ali recently commented on Bitcoin’s price action, noting that Bitcoin is still trading within a “descending parallel channel.” According to Ali, the asset was rejected at the upper boundary of this channel, signalling the potential for further downside. “We might see a drop to the middle boundary at $58,000 or even the lower boundary at $52,000,” Ali noted in a post on X.

However, this capitulation could be followed by a “full bull” market. Bitcoin Headed Lower Before Higher In a detailed thread on X about BTC price analysis, crypto analyst Cole Garner stated that capitulation might be on the horizon for the leading digital asset. Garner attributes the potential downturn to tightening on-chain liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Options Set To Supercharge Price Volatility, Expert Warns Tracking global liquidity from central banks worldwide, the analyst said he sees a “buy signal” for digital assets. However, more downsides for cryptocurrencies could come before liquidity-enhancing measures undertaken by central banks buoy them. In his analysis, Garner stated that “if China doesn’t ring that bell, the Fed or Japan should do the job,” likely pointing toward the recent economic stimulus injected by the Chinese central bank in a bid to boost the country’s grim economic outlook. Garner referenced the recent economic stimulus from China’s central bank but noted that this week, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) refrained from injecting additional liquidity, tempering expectations for risk-on assets like crypto. Garner emphasized the low supply of stablecoins compared to the beginning of October 2024. Analyzing the “Bitfinex grail,” which is essentially the total supply of two leading stablecoins on the exchange – USDT and USDC – Garner noted its quarterly rate of change is declining, potentially leading to lower prices for digital assets in the short term. Despite these concerns, Garner pointed out that Bitcoin has printed a higher high on the 8-hour chart, and the market structure remains bullish. Even if BTC dips to its range lows in the high $40k range, the overall price action is still considered positive. Garner suggested that should BTC hit its range of lows, traders and investors can consider buying at that price. Even if they are low on liquid cash, they must ensure they don’t get spooked by the market and panic-sell their current holdings. Another crypto analyst, Ali, seemed to echo Garner’s outlook, stating that Bitcoin is stuck in a descending parallel channel and runs the risk of sliding to channel lows of around $52,000. The analyst stressed that BTC must overcome the $66,000 level for a bullish breakout. Can Bitcoin Hit New All-Time Highs In 2024? With the remainder of 2024 ahead, Bitcoin bulls anticipate interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to fuel a new rally. However, BTC must clear several hurdles to sustain its bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Puell Multiple Signals A Bullish Surge: Could A New ATH Be Near? Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently noted that BTC must overcome the $64,000 resistance level to trigger a rally in Q4 2024. Failure to break through this price level could lead to further downside. Further, Bitcoin’s price finally turned green in October, giving bulls hopes of another “uptober” for the asset, which was marked by significant price increases. BTC trades at $60,711 at press time, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

Indicators Point Toward More Upward Movement For Uniswap On the 4-hour chart, Uniswap is showing strength as it approaches the $8.7 resistance level while trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). UNI’s positioning above the SMA indicates a firm trend, suggesting that buyers are gaining confidence with the potential of targeting higher resistance levels. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) points to the possibility of continued upward movement, as the RSI has rebounded to the 73% threshold after previously dipping to 52%. This rise indicates that positive momentum is gaining traction, suggesting that buyers are increasingly in control and that further gains could be on the horizon.

If Uniswap can sustain this push, it may open the door for additional price appreciation and challenge higher resistance levels. Furthermore, the RSI on the daily chart is currently at 65%, having risen from a previous low of 43%. This upward movement suggests that UNI is gaining momentum, signaling more growth. If buying interest continues to hold steady, the positive trajectory indicated by the RSI could support an extended rally for Uniswap, reinforcing positive sentiment in the market. Potential Upside Targets: How Far Can the Bulls Push UNI? As Uniswap maintains its upward momentum, the immediate resistance level to watch is $8.7, which could pave the way for a challenge of higher thresholds if surpassed. A breakout above this level could see UNI targeting the $10.3 mark, where significant psychological resistance may come into play. Related Reading: UNI In Trouble?
