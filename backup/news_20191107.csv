TrueEx was first granted the registration in January 2016.  Tassat, formerly known as trueDigital Holdings, said in July that it was looking to launch a ""fully-regulated"" cryptocurrency derivatives exchange in the U.S., on which it would offer customers physically-delivered bitcoin swaps and other products.  At the time, Tassat CEO Thomas Kim said ""adding the exchange to our ecosystem delivers a complete end-to-end offering, currently unavailable today, that encompasses tokenization, payments, market data and settlement for the benefit of our clients and partners.""  ""TrueEX and Tassat met the requirement for transferring a SEF registration by demonstrating that Tassat will be in compliance with provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations applicable to SEFs after the registration is transferred. There are currently 19 registered SEFs, including Tassat,"" Wednesday's press release said.  Tassat, founded in early 2018, has been an active participant in the crypto community. The company helped Signature Bank build its Signet blockchain payments platform, launched last December. More recently, the company partnered with software provider AlgoTrader to offer institutional clients access to its upcoming crypto derivatives.  The company has also partnered with Inca Digital Securities and Kaiko to offer wider access to its over-the-counter bitcoin and ether reference rates.  With Wednesday's approval, Tassat is one step closer to offering clients a trading platform for its products. The company is still waiting to secure the designated contract market (DCM) registration trueEX also held.

42387634,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlwPX,1573162227,The SEC Has Rejected Every Bitcoin ETF. This Firm Thinks It Has a Solution,"One company thinks it knows how to get a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved by U.S. regulators.  Wilshire Phoenix, a relatively young financial firm in New York, filed to launch the United States Bitcoin & Treasury Investment Trust ETF in May with NYSE Arca. At that point, a dozen bitcoin ETF proposals had already been swatted down by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – including nine in one day. But unlike other ETF applications, Wilshire Phoenix's ETF will invest in both bitcoin and U.S. Treasury securities, commonly referred to as T-bills.  The SEC is currently reviewing the application.  ""Our proposed bitcoin-related ETF is quite different from those that have previously been submitted to the Commission for approval,"" Wilshire Phoenix founder and managing partner William Herrmann said in a phone interview. ""To name just a few distinctions, the composition of the Trust is very different. Our Trust is a multi-asset trust (bitcoin and T-Bills), as opposed to just bitcoin.""  The SEC has long been hesitant to approve an ETF with exposure to digital assets, citing the market's relatively young age and the possible risks to investors. The agency has rejected a number of proposals, while other applicants have proactively withdrawn their filings.  Herrmann says the Wilshire ETF has several mechanisms to address these concerns.  The Trust itself will automatically rebalance itself monthly to address possible concerns about bitcoin's price volatility, Herrmann explained. Essentially, if bitcoin's price volatility increases, the index will reduce its exposure to the cryptocurrency and instead increase its exposure to Treasury bills. As bitcoin's volatility falls, the opposite occurs.  The weighting will be transparent, with the index being shown on Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters portals, he said.  The CME's Bitcoin Reference Rate will provide the data for bitcoin's price in the Trust, rather than use an in-house price method ""or one from any related party,"" he added.  Wilshire Phoenix is also hoping to address SEC concerns about market manipulation by using a surveillance sharing agreement, one component the regulator stressed was needed when rejecting a recent bitcoin ETF application. Herrmann said:  ""The CME has surveillance sharing agreements with both the CME futures market as well as the relevant portion of the spot market that forms the basis for the Trust's bitcoin values. This addresses the SEC concerns about the lack of surveillance sharing agreements with the relevant spot market, which is something previous applicants have not been able to address.""  Most recently, the SEC denied Bitwise Asset Management's fund. In a whopping 112-page order published Oct. 9, the regulator said surveillance-sharing agreements were necessary and market manipulation remains a real concern.  As recently as September, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said that while progress has been made in the space, the market manipulation question had not been resolved.  For Wilshire Phoenix's proposal, the SEC began accepting comments on the proposal in June, though a final decision is still months away. The agency is currently accepting comments on the proposal through Nov. 12, 2019.  Herrmann is optimistic about the ETF proposal’s chances, saying “we developed the ETF consistent with investor protection as well as fair, orderly and efficient markets.”  SEC image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/07/the-sec-has-rejected-every-bitcoin-etf-this-firm-thinks-it-has-a-solution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22a252d7ce6d4fb476e2cb28fa92122d91f7637d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403505,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgAnB,1573155043,Stellar's Plan to Win Global Payments: Play Nice With the Finance Cops,"MEXICO CITY – There's a mobile app approved by the Mexican government that lets 20,000 migrant workers in the U.S. pay bills back home over the Stellar network.  That's according to Marco Montes Neri, the creator of the Saldo app, which relies on peso-backed stablecoins. ""Stellar has created a set of protocols and a set of standards to handle all these regulatory obligations,"" he said, adding:  ""If you want to touch real people's money, you really need to play ball with regulators.""  This theme came up again and again at the Stellar Meridian conference this week in Mexico City, with roughly 350 people, most of whom were building on Stellar, in attendance. Embracing financial rules seemed to be a defining theme; Facebook's ""move fast and break things"" was not the mantra.  ""Making sure Stellar is useful for actual people"" was always the goal, said Jed McCaleb, who created the cryptocurrency in 2014. ""That will ultimately always come back to some sort of regulatory situation ... we don't avoid it.""  McCaleb now serves as the chief technical officer of the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) at a time when the race over blockchain-based global payments is increasingly crowded. In 2012, McCaleb co-founded Ripple, which now focuses on cross-border bank transfers, but in recent months Facebook's Libra project has pushed talk of crypto remittances under the regulatory microscope.  Stellar's advantage is that it's already here and moving – with a built-in compliance layer just above the protocol itself. This allows users to plug into a common set of know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) standards.  Neri said that makes Stellar helpful for a business like his in a way that, say, ethereum does not.  “In other ledgers, that layer doesn’t exist yet because it hasn’t been the focus,” Neri said. “You can build it, but the problem is that it’s not compatible with another project that wants to do the same thing.”  SDF CEO Denelle Dixon says she doesn't want to just help people cope with regulations; she wants to go to rule-makers and show them how blockchain technology is making the world a more orderly place. Said Dixon:  ""We need to actually focus on getting more regulators involved.""  Community buy-in  Cole Diamond, CEO of CoinSquare, a crypto exchange in Canada, told the Meridian crowd that ""the majority of us went and trailblazed with our regulators.""  Diamond said his company actually left a lot of money on the table by leaning into his province's laws. As fellow Canadian exchanges crumble, he doesn't regret it.  ""I can't suggest strongly enough the importance of doing that,"" Diamond said.  Pavel Matveev of Wirex, a startup for global crypto-to-fiat value transfer, told the assembled Stellar fans, ""It's actually quite risky not be regulated.""  Though no one disputed that governments tend to be frustratingly slow. Amit Sharma, CEO of FinClusive Capital, which makes a compliance-as-a-service platform, urged founders to proactively approach policymakers with ideas.  ""Because inherently innovation outpaces regulators,"" Sharma said.  Ernest Mbenkum, founder and CEO of Interstellar Wallet and Exchange, holds out hope. ""Governments, they can't resist it forever,"" he said. ""At the same time, they are going to want to be able to control it. It's an interesting dance.""  How central banks see it  There's one way that nation-states could embrace crypto with unsettling consequences for the industry: by putting fiat currencies onto a blockchain.  ""If central banks decide to issue a CBDC [central bank digital cryptocurrency], it's going to be in token form, and it's going to be delegated,"" Francisco Rivadeneyra, a research advisor at the Bank of Canada, predicted on stage Tuesday morning. A delegated CBDC means partners will help the bank to manage consensus and track payments, in some way similar to blockchains like EOS and Libra (as currently envisioned).  Linda Schilling, a professor of financial economics at Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, said:  ""The rise of cryptocurrencies has in some ways pushed central banks to think about how to compete.""  She believes central banks understand that if any cryptocurrency becomes globally adopted, it will allow citizens within a nation-state to opt-out of a central bank's policies. Users who could use crypto for a significant portion of their economic lives would be shielded from a bank's plans for managing inflation or economic growth.  But if central banks beat crypto companies to the punch and start taking over peer-to-peer payments, an enormous amount of data will accrue to what are, in the end, political institutions.  ""As you move toward central bank currency, you move much more toward a business model like Facebook and Google and so on,"" she said. Among other things, political appointees would have far too much information about voters, dissidents and political rivals.  Libra looming  Of course, the proposal that has spurred the most gesticulating from central bankers has been Libra, the cryptocurrency proposed by Facebook in June.  As it happens, Libra has basically the same vision as Stellar – speed, low fees, financial inclusion, easy token creation. Themes that are very familiar to McCaleb's fans.  ""It's fair to say that all the noise associated with Libra had a kind of negative effect,"" said Wirex CEO Matveev.  For his part, McCaleb told CoinDesk he thinks Mark Zuckerberg and his Libra lieutenants don't really understand what they are getting into.  Said McCaleb:  ""Their approach seems a little bit arrogant, at least from an outside perspective. The way they announced it seemed a little bit premature.""  McCaleb said Libra doesn't look decentralized enough to him and he doesn't believe the founding partners will ever fully decentralize it, though he acknowledges he has a bias there. Libra is attempting to build at scale essentially the same global payments network SDF has already built.  But Mbenkum, the founder of Interstellar Wallet and Exchange, argued that Stellar's advantage for reaching the unbanked is not its cryptocurrency, XLM. Rather, it's the system of ""anchors,"" the Stellar lingo for companies making asset-backed tokens on the network.  ""Stellar, bitcoin, that's the first wave. The next wave is asset-backed tokens,"" Mbenkum said. He sees huge potential in scores of new tokens based on real stuff. People in emerging markets don't understand abstract things like cryptocurrencies, Mbenkum said.  ""People understand tea. People understand yams,"" he said, and they will understand something that promises the future delivery of such products. ""This is where the world is going in emerging markets,"" he said.  McCaleb is hopeful, too, though he knows progress is slow. He pointed to Saldo's peso-backed stablecoin and another anchor in Nigeria that is slowly building a following by helping people get money in and out.  McCaleb seemed actively reluctant to oversell it all, but he did offer this:  ""It seems like we are on the cusp of these things actually making people's lives better.""

In an effort to fight cybercrime, the Ministry of Internal Affairs intends to develop legislation allowing law agencies to force criminals to hand over ill-gotten digital gains and wants proposals on the books by December 2021, according to a report from Russian news source RBC Thursday.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs will be joined by the finance regulator Rosfinmonitoring, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Investigative Committee, the Justice Ministry, the Federal Customs Service, the Federal Security Service and the Supreme Court in developing the proposals.  Long-awaited regulation addressing crypo assets more generally has been held up in the Russian parliament, further complicating the issue. A legal definition of cryptos, perhaps as commodities or cash-equivalents, is required to allow forfeiture, according to the report. However, the definition being set out in the new rules may not be appropriate in this case.  There are other potential problems down the road for the plan, too. Regulators are aware of the difficulties of confiscating crypto residing in various wallet types protected by both encryption and user passwords, RBC sources said.  Still, authorities believe they may be able to work with exchanges to isolate and freeze funds, said Nikita Kulikov, member of the State Duma's expert council and founder of PravoRobotov Autonomous Non-Profit Organization.  Additionally, agencies may have to develop their own crypto wallets and find ways to exchange digital assets into fiat. “For these purposes, they can create a state crypto-exchange and crypto-ruble with a stable rate in which they will store the withdrawn funds,” Kulikov said.  While law enforcement moves to become acquainted with cryptocurrency, Russia’s central bank is maintaining indifference.

The five drilled through the concrete wall connecting the two buildings. All the suspects were friends without past criminal records, The Sun writes.  Worth $10,300 each, the machines were most likely bitcoin mining rigs, although local police did not specify.  “On Oct. 29, a shopkeeper lodged a police report following the missing of 85 bitcoin machines,” Seremban police chief Supt Mohd Said Ibrahim said in a press conference. “Subsequently, police conducted raids and arrested suspects, aged between 25 and 46 years.”  The raids occurred last Saturday night between midnight and 5:00 a.m. local time.

Roughly a year after it first filed for its initial public offering, Silvergate began its “IPO day” on the NYSE, according to the stock exchange’s Twitter account. The news comes a day after Silvergate received a “notice of effectiveness” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating its long-running IPO bid had been accepted.  The bank currently serves more than 750 firms in the crypto space, including exchanges, investors and others, according to an updated IPO prospectus filed in September 2019.  This is up significantly from the 542 clients it reported in March 2019. At the time, while the bank saw its client base grow between November 2018 and March 2019, the assets it held shrank marginally, falling from nearly $1.6 billion to $1.5 billion in the last quarter of 2018.  In September’s filing, these numbers grew again, holding $1.55 billion in deposits.  SIlvergate priced its stock pricing at $12 per share on Nov. 6, and is planning to offer 3,333,333 shares of Class A common stock. Just under 1 million of these shares are being offered directly by Silvergate, while shareholders are offering the other 2.5 million, according to a press release.  These numbers are more conservative than an updated S1 filing dated late October 2019, where the company priced each share at a maximum of $15 and sought to raise roughly $65 million overall. If it sells the 3.3 million shares for $12 each, the company will more likely raise approximately $40 million.  The bank is hoping to sell these shares under the “SI” ticker by Nov. 12.

42403496,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgAgI,1573139735,Zcash Trademark Talks Were About More Than a Logo,"Electric Coin Company (ECC), the firm led by zcash creator Zooko Wilcox, officially shared the zcash trademark with the Zcash Foundation (ZF) on Wednesday.  Sources with knowledge of the trademark negotiations told CoinDesk talks were more complicated than either party originally expected, especially with regards to the mutual ability to veto trademark usage.  And while the branding issue may seem trivial to some observers, the process took months – becoming a bellwether of the privacy coin’s decentralized aspirations.  “It’s a novel agreement, for which there appears to be no precedent,” ECC announced Thursday, highlighting one provision in particular:  “No party has independent authority to declare that a specific chain of Zcash can actually be called Zcash. There must be agreement from both parties, and neither party can unilaterally override the will of the community.”  Wilcox told CoinDesk last week the zcash trademark negotiations were emotionally painful. He likened it to watching a baby bird leave the nest.  “As a person, I am devoted to zcash and can never stop working for zcash and all that it means for humanity,” he said. ""As the ECC, of course, we can only work for the community if they hire us to do so.""  Since his startup spearheaded the launch of this privacy coin in 2016, Wilcox has been the de facto public face of the cryptocurrency. To him, the trademark agreement is a sign of the project “rapidly moving to a status where I don’t have the power to make something happen or stop it from happening.”  However, it’s hard to imagine what the nonprofit would look like completely separated from ECC, since zcash founders are now its main source of funding.  Wilcox personally became wealthy from the zcash founders’ reward, which delegates a portion of newly mined coins to the founding team. Along with other co-founders, Wilcox donated to the independent Zcash Foundation, as a type of checks-and-balances entity apart from the for-profit startup ECC. Several academically minded zcash co-founders, such as Andrew Miller, became foundation board members.  “I’ve pledged half of all the money I expect to see in the world to fund the foundation,” Wilcox said.  Yet even with the best intentions, this trademark struggle was, according to Zcash Foundation director Josh Cincinnati, part of the political growing pains associated with decentralization.  “You have to make these small tactical decisions every day that might loosen grips of power you might be accustomed to or comfortable with,” Cincinnati told CoinDesk. “It requires a lot of risk and faith in the community to take the reins properly.”  Governance  While many people in the crypto industry still turn to ethereum co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin for funding and cultural guidance, the zcash community is publicly signaling it wants to create a different governance structure.  At least four independent entrepreneurs and venture capitalists submitted their own public proposals for the network’s October 2020 upgrade, when the original founders’ reward funding mechanism will expire.  The reward system won’t expire on its own. The reality is that both firms currently dominating network development, ECC and the ZF, will push necessary upgrades the community will adopt that redirect that cash flow. The community is currently grappling with where those funds will go in the future.  “We hope they [ECC] use the same data and if there's divergence we'll need to work it out with them,” Cincinnati said. “Users are free to fork off of course … if they don't like the outcome. It's important to note that neither ZF nor ECC could get away with flagrantly ignoring what the community wants.”  Based on proposals and social media chatter, what the community wants is a peaceful transfer of power from benevolent leaders to a participatory republic. And that, based on centuries of political history, tends to be the hardest deliverable.  “The unique governance model in zcash is that it’s community-driven and it’s self-funding,” Wilcox said. “Anything that’s not self-funding is at risk of capture.”  Proposals  Several proposals suggest the new developer fund should be managed by a new, third-party council with rotating members determined by democratic voting.  “I think it’s important to have an entity that doesn’t have these conflicts of interest. That [board members] actually have investment experience,” Autonomous Partners founder, ZEC holder and proposal writer Arianna Simpson told CoinDesk. “While I appreciate the academic lens and the role that professional cryptographers have to play in the community, I don’t think that is sufficient, in terms of skill set.”  The trouble is, where will all these new candidates and voters come from? According to Zcash Foundation communications manager Sonya Mann, roughly 64 community members participated in electing the foundation’s board in 2018, which took considerable outreach and work on the nonprofit’s part.  “If we had a robust, both Sybil-resistant and anonymous voting system, then we wouldn’t even be having this conversation,” Mann told CoinDesk.  On the other hand, Simpson was clear the ECC and ZF should both receive funding for the foreseeable future.  “I think some of the animosity towards Zooko is misplaced,” she said. She was, after all, Wilcox’s personal nomination for the foundation board in the past 2018 election. (In the end, voters chose Clovyr CEO Amber Baldet, among others, instead.) These days, Simpson continues to play an active role in community governance by participating in public forums.  “Over time their roles should diminish, but that time isn’t now,” Simpson said. “I think the risk with zcash is nobody is doing the work. All that work, I believe, needs to be done in a centralized manner.”  Indeed, a study published in August by Electric Capital found less than 40 developers were regularly contributing to zcash. (By comparison, the study found bitcoin routinely has more than 100 contributing developers and ethereum has roughly 1,200 developers.) If zcash is going to thrive, these numbers need to grow dramatically without crippling current teams.  Another proposal writer, Chris Burniske of venture capital firm Placeholder, told CoinDesk:  “[ECC] is one of the most talented technical teams in the space and they deserve to be funded to work on the promise of the zcash protocol.”  Evolving organisms  Electric Capital co-founder Avichal Garg told CoinDesk the zcash community is looking to other blockchains – like bitcoin, ethereum and even decred – for lessons on governance. He compared crypto communities to evolving organisms defined by their environment, saying:  “The environment that bitcoin evolved in and grew up in has changed, if only for the reason that now bitcoin exists. I don’t think [zcash] will look like bitcoin. I don’t think it will look like ethereum, with a foundation, ConsenSys and thousands of developers.”  Stepping back, the bitcoin community diversified long before the asset garnered much public attention and market activity. Ethereum grew much faster because co-founders like Lubin and Buterin prioritized evangelizing and spending their own money to encourage external experiments, Garg said. Wilcox has arguably done the same, albeit with a smaller fortune.  “There gets to be one chain [bitcoin] that says, ‘We are the store-of-value chain that never changes,’” Matt Luongo, CEO of the crypto development studio Thesis, said of bitcoin. “I think this is an opportunity for zcash to say: ‘Look, we are different. We are not just a professor-coin or research-chain, but we are at the forefront of privacy tech.’”  But Placeholder’s Burniske says another ingredient is needed.  “These networks thrive, as ethereum has shown us, off of third-party investment. It’s not the technology alone that drives a network,” Burniske said. “In order to get third-party investment, you need to give these parties a voice. The zcash community is trying to figure out the best way to do that.”  In contrast to Decred, a smaller crypto community sustaining a few dozen developers without relying on a benevolent leader or corporate structure, Burniske said a “slightly more centralized form of governance” might be more palatable to enterprises.  “While both Decred and zcash are good alternative stores of value, zcash, given the anonymity using zk-Snarks, has a lot of interesting business and enterprise applications,” Burniske said.  Leaderless?  Despite differing views on how zcash should evolve, in a true anomaly in the space, all interviewed parties agreed Wilcox has done an excellent job shepherding the privacy coin so far.  There also appears to be a robust community of people who want to participate in the open-source project, as evidenced by the roughly 200 people who attended the annual zcash conference in June.  However, some people would like to eventually see Wilcox play a less central role. “For [zcash] to actually work, this can’t be about him,” said Electric Capital’s Garg.  And that, Wilcox concluded, was always the goal.

Working in conjunction with Microsoft through the firm's Azure blockchain-as-a-service sandbox since 2016, Webjet said Thursday the new Rezchain application will address hotel reservation snafus and overcharges by looking for data mismatches in real-time between customers, hotels and booking agents, and sending alerts if any are found.  Such errors are found in at least 5 percent of bookings, according to the firm. Once identified, they trigger ""a time consuming and painful reconciliation process, resulting in heavy resourcing requirements and financial exposure.""  Founded in 1998, ASX 200-listed Webjet hosts an online travel agent business throughout Southeast Asia, Australia and North America. The firm also operates business-to-business accommodation platform WebBeds.  Combining a “virtual handshake"" and email ""early warning system,” Webjet says Rezchain leverages the distributed nature of blockchain technology, storing information on a shared ledger to give each party involved with online bookings up-to-the-moment information. According to its website, Rezchain is built on a private version of ethereum.  John Guscic, managing director at Webjet, said in a statement:  “With multiple IT systems speaking different languages, mistakes are probable, and the default position is often to write off debts when the situation is not clear.

42403486,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgAXR,1573131635,Crypto Exchange CEX.io Boosts US Push With Silvergate’s Payment Network,"U.K.-based cryptocurrency exchange CEX.io has joined the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), the payment rail connecting major customers of Silvergate, the go-to bank of the crypto space.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Steve Gregory, chief compliance officer and corporate counsel of CEX.io Corp, called Silvergate “the gold standard” when it comes to U.S. crypto compliance, and said joining SEN meant being included in a kind of institutional crypto “club”.  By participating in SEN, CEX.io is connected directly to big institutional crypto players like Coinbase Prime, Cumberland, Kraken OTC, BitStamp, Jump and Circle, to name a few.  CEX.io, which began offering services to US customers in 2015, established a headquarters in Jersey City, NJ, and now holds some 17 state licenses to operate its exchange. The company has 250 staff and operates in 180 countries.  Gregory was formerly a compliance officer at Gemini, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)-regulated exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, which also recently joined SEN.  He told CoinDesk:  “We are in the club now. Silvergate is the biggest bank in the space and with the SEN and we can facilitate trades to some of those larger institutions that are members.”  SEN provides Silvergate’s large institutional clients an instant fiat payment rail, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This means if a proprietary trading house such as Cumberland, for example, wants to move a few million dollars to CEX.io, this can be done without using a wire transfer.  Silvergate’s internal online banking uses an API to transfer the funds instantly on an internal ledger. “Instead of doing a wire and then a wall to wall transaction, we can just have Silvergate move our balance of USD,” Gregory said.  Although there is no hard data on how many firms are in the SEN and regularly using its internal payment rail (Silvergate is currently in an IPO quiet period and unable to comment), users of the service say the number of transactions is significant.  Removing counterparty risk from OTC crypto trades and enabling them to be always on is a good idea, which is also being explored by the likes of BitGo and OTC desk Genesis, as well as Kingdom Trust and trading firm OTCXN.  US plans  There’s a short list of banks that will handle crypto companies. CEX.io US also recently became a customer of Nevada-licensed trust company Prime Trust, which now provides the fiat on-ramp and banking relationship for Binance U.S. Signature Bank is another popular crypto bank, which CEX has worked with.  “Signature Bank has been great to us and has been efficient and seamless to work with,” said Gregory. “Signature does have the unfortunate limitation that they cannot process retail wire and ACH transfers under $50,000 without batching the transactions.”  Based on this limitation, he said CEX.io “will use Silvergate for retail, under $50,000, ACH and wire deposits or withdrawals.”  In addition to the 16 or so U.S. states that don’t require a license, CEX.io has acquired licenses to operate in: Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia.  The firm applied for a BitLicense in the spring and held initial meetings with the NYDFS, said Gregory. A CEX.io spokesman added that the anticipated approval would be “in a few months from the NYDFS which administers the Bitlicense and the New York Money Transmitter License.”  Speaking to the “high barrier to entry” when setting up shop in the U.S, Gregory pointed out that setting up surety bonds in order to operate in each state is expensive, especially while having to wait to get a license application looked at, concluding:  “It makes it tough to disrupt some of the bigger exchanges that are already established.”    Image: Alex Kravets, CEO of CEX.io's U.S. subsidiary, courtesy of the company",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | WALLET | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/07/crypto-exchange-cexio-boosts-us-push-with-silvergates-payment-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e854b35ee8cde1d63bf55a2b0ecf6596f31b974-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a company blog Wednesday, Coinbase said U.S. customers (barring residents of Hawaii and New York) can now stake the smart-contract platform’s crypto with an estimated 5 percent annual return.  Tezos uses an alternative consensus mechanism to proof-of-work mining – the system built into the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin. Called proof-of-stake, the alternative mechanism rewards network users for holding onto its coins and thereby helping protect the network.  Coinbase’s 5 percent estimate is based on Tezos’ last 90 days of staking returns. The firm also notes that there's an initial holding period of 35–40 days, after which stakers will start to see rewards appear in their accounts every three days.  The exchange has also added Tezos to Coinbase Earn, a program aimed at educating the public about crypto, and will give out XTZ to participants completing educational videos.  Coinbase soft-launched staking for both Tezos and decentralized finance token Maker (MKR) this March on Coinbase Custody.  As Coinbase wrote at the time, Coinbase Custody primarily serves institutional clients holding large amounts of crypto. This latest initiative brings staking to even the smallest of Tezos holdings, however.  Coinbase also recently rolled out 1.25 percent interest on users' holdings of the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC.

42403503,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgAmC,1573124416,Bitcoin Price Risks Drop Below $9K if Bulls Can't Muster Rally Soon,"View  Bitcoin's repeated failure to produce a strong bounce from key support indicates the bullish sentiment has fizzled somewhat.  Failure to hold above a bearish MA on the longer-term chart indicates scope for a deeper drop.  BTC risks falling to $8,800 in the short-term and may extend the decline to $8,500.  A high-volume triangle breakout on a 4-hour chart would be bullish, although that looks unlikely at press time.  Bitcoin is struggling to revive its stalled rally and could soon roll over to deeper support levels below $9,000.  The top cryptocurrency picked up a bid near $7,500 on Oct. 25 and jumped to $10,350 on the following day, according to Bitstamp data. The breakout into five figures, however, was short-lived, as prices quickly fell back below $10,000 on Oct. 28 and have remained largely trapped in a narrow range of $9,600–$9,000 since.  Downside has been restricted so far by the 200-day average – a barometer of long-term market trends. A pullback typically reverses from key support levels like the 200-day MA, especially if volumes are low, as has been the case recently.  So far, however, the cryptocurrency has failed to produce a strong bounce from the support, despite positive seasonality.  Prices jumped more than $400 to $9,586 from the MA on Nov. 4 only to surrender gains on the following day. A similar weak bounce has been observed in the last 24 hours or so with prices rising to $9,450 only to dive back to lows near $9,200.  These shallow bounces indicate bullish sentiment generated by the sharp rise to $10,350 has weakened and the market may test dip demand by revisiting levels below $9,000.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,170 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.50 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  BTC's upside has been capped by the trendline connecting June 26 and Aug. 6 lows multiple times in the last few days. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has tested the 200-day MA support five times in eight days.  Trading volumes have fallen sharply since the recent drop-off from $10,350. Low-volume pullbacks are often reversed, but a decent bounce continues to remain elusive.  All-in-all, the cryptocurrency looks set for a drop to the former resistance-turned-support of $8,800.  Monthly chart  The upper shadow of the monthly candle represents rejection above the 5-month MA at $9,265. A failure to hold above descending averages usually translates into a notable price drop. Major support is seen at the ascending 10-month MA near $8,000.  4-hour chart  The contracting triangle seen above looks likely to be breached to the lower side, as suggested by the daily and monthly indicators.  The ascending 100- and 200-candle MAs, currently at $8,928 and $8,558, respectively, could offer support if a drop out of the zone is confirmed.  The bearish view would be invalidated if the triangle ends with a high-volume bullish breakout. In that case, a retest of $10,000 could be seen.

The joint statement comes two weeks after President Xi Jinping called on Communist Party leadership to “seize the opportunity” provided by blockchain technology, seeking for a top-down implementation approach along with wide-spread testing of blockchain’s applicability for the Chinese economy.  The PBoC is currently developing its own digital yuan, expected to be built at least in part with blockchain technology.

In remarks delivered Wednesday at Hong Kong Fintech week, Ashley Alder, chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said Libra and other ""Big Tech"" stablecoin projects pose a deep threat to fragmented financial regulators around the world.  The risk comes not when countries shore up their domestic anti-money laundering and consumer protection laws, but when some do, and others don’t, Alder said.  Explaining the ""arbitrage"" threat – that is, when companies flee stricter jurisdictions for nations with more lax regulations – Alder said:  ""If a retail stablecoin is approved in one jurisdiction, whether as a security, payment system, fund, trading platform or another category (or a combination of these), it could easily go global very quickly if it rides on the back of the huge user-base of a Big Tech platform.""  Alder acknowledged that Libra’s explosion into the public consciousness has brought added scrutiny around the area. Indeed, recent pressure from Chinese, U.S. and EU regulators has triggered a hemorrhage among the project's governing council, with several companies exiting the project even before the namesake Libra Association was formally created.  Regardless of how Libra itself performs or if it launches, Alder said, its very existence has drawn much regulatory attention to the crypto space.  ""In 2018, the crypto world was seen to be of marginal importance to the global financial system. The Financial Stability Board, which is basically the G20’s financial regulatory arm, concluded last year that, although blockchain 'currencies' such as Bitcoin were problematic from an investor protection angle, they did not yet pose any significant financial stability risks,"" he said. ""But then came Facebook’s Libra, and the international regulatory community had to get its act together very rapidly.""  “But, regardless of its future prospects, the Libra project has galvanized regulators across the world to look far harder at the opportunities and risks inherent in virtual assets.”  Alder’s remarks at the Fintech conference also presaged the release of SFC’s updated regulatory framework for crypto exchanges.

42403498,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgAhH,1573117200,3 Insights on Crypto Derivatives and Risk From Veteran OTC Traders,"For all the talk about liquidity, bitcoin and other crypto-assets are thinly traded. Investors that buy and sell large volumes can't do so directly, without slippage, or a change in the price between order and execution.  They turn to over-the-counter (OTC) desks to manage those trades, whether buying crypto for the first time, or trading to generate alpha (above-market returns).  As a result, these desks handle anywhere from 30 percent to 65 percent of total crypto market volume, depending on whose estimate you believe. To get a look inside this business, CoinDesk Research talked to two veteran OTC traders in a live webinar on Oct. 28.  Martin Garcia is managing director and co-head of trading at Genesis Trading. Yinfeng Shao is a former trader at Circle and now the CEO of a development-stage OTC firm, Reciprocity Trading.  OTC desks take on tremendous, temporary risk. Traders like Martin and Yin are tasked with managing that risk by moving large amounts quickly and offsetting it on derivatives markets, including BitMEX, Huobi, OKEx, CME Bitcoin Futures and Bakkt. (For background, CoinDesk Research has produced a white paper on the state of crypto derivatives markets. You can download it for free here.)  As a result, they are among the most sophisticated traders on crypto derivatives exchanges. Here are a few of the insights Martin and Yin shared during our hour-long conversation. Sign up and listen to the entire webinar here, and check out our other live conversations at coindesk.com/webinars.  1. Investors' mentality has shifted  The mentality of investors has changed since the earlier days of crypto, from venture-like to hedge-fund-like.  ""There's a lot more velocity amongst the traders that are out there, whereas in the early days it was very much more a buy-and-hold"" strategy, Martin said. ""People these days understand that this market is super volatile and a lot of the different crypto funds and people that are out there, they are trying to add alpha for their shareholders.""  2. Derivatives markets move the spot market  First of all, market moves get started on derivatives exchanges more often than on spot exchanges.  ""Because there are so many trading venues, it's a constant question of, where is the action starting?"" Yin said. ""Often it's starting on derivatives exchanges because that's where a lot of people have connections and that's where a lot of the most highly levered bets are taking place.""  ""Crypto already is a fairly random, volatile walk in terms of price action and the collection of these derivatives and the exchanges that list them effectively act as leverage on top of that,"" he went on. ""Whenever you start to make a move, there's a good chance it will get exacerbated because of the amount of open bets that are out there.""  In isolated examples, like the May 17 flash crash, a small amount on spot markets can cause a large move on the offshore derivatives markets, specifically BitMEX, allowing traders to manipulate the spot price in favor of their derivatives markets position.  Theoretically, that's possible on regulated crypto derivatives markets like CME's, but it's more expensive and difficult because the leverage is not as high.  That's not the only way derivatives markets can fail.  ""Where things tend to break down a bit and you get a lot more slippage is when you've simply exhausted everybody's ability to really use the derivatives instruments to hedge, so whether that's the amount of collateral that everyone's posted is insufficient, or the market conditions are such that you really can't get access to some of these platforms,"" Yin said.  3. Two products dominate derivatives  The most popular product is the perpetual swap, reputedly invented by BitMEX. Crypto futures are a close second. A handful of OTC desks can provide swaps and custom derivative products, including contracts for difference, but those two products have dominated market volume so far.  Bitcoin options are emerging, but remain a small percentage of overall volume. As providers including Bakkt and CME have announced plans to bring options on bitcoin futures into the markets, Yin and Martin said these may prove attractive for large investors entering crypto, looking for a hedge against a big downside in a volatile market.  ""I think it means there are more sophisticated hedging strategies. It allows people to be more comfortable with spot exposure, if it can be more easily hedged out,"" Martin said. ""These markets move really quickly and a lot of the bigger places that want to start trading, there's a significant amount of headline risk attached to this. How do they protect against the crazy downside move? Options may very well help eliminate some of those risks for them.""  Sign up and listen to the entire webinar, here  .

The company revealed in an updated filing of its initial public offering (IPO) application in the US on Wednesday that it has been able to bring home a profit of $13 million on a revenue of 670 million yuan, or $95 million, which records a 40 percent growth over the same period last year.  That would give the company a total net loss of $31.2 million on a revenue of $132 million for nine months ending in September this year, as the firm recorded a net loss $45.8 million for the first half of 2019.  Canaan officially filed for an IPO in the U.S. last month as its third attempt to go public after its first two applications in mainland China and Hong Kong, respectively, fell through.  Bitcoin's price jump since earlier this year has boosted the sales of Canaan's Avalon miners, which resulted in the market's demand outstripping the firm's supply.

42382960,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZAd,1573102840,Asia's Bakkt? AAX Rolls Out Crypto Trading With London Stock Exchange Tech,"AAX, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange that uses the London Stock Exchange (LSE)'s matching engine technology, has officially launched.  After 19 months of development and testing, the company said on Thursday that the exchange platform has gone live on web and mobile, targeting retail and institutional investors with spot, futures and over-the-counter peer-to-peer trading.  The LSE said previously that AAX would be the first crypto exchange to utilize its Millennium Exchange matching engine. Other major equity markets like the London one itself and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange also uses trading platform tech from the LSE.  In addition to crypto-to-crypto spot trading, AAX expects the derivatives market to be a major focus with its offering of perpetual contract futures settled in bitcoin. These contracts, which have no expiration date, will be tied to the performance of five digital assets – bitcoin, ether, ripple, litecoin, and EOS – with up to 100 times leverage.  AAX claims that with the LSE's matching engine, it can settle futures trades at an average speed of less than 0.0005 seconds. To put that in perspective, Binance advertises a low-latency settlement of 0.005 seconds for all its current and upcoming products on Binance Futures.  “LSEG Technology is delighted to have successfully deployed our world class matching engine capabilities at AAX. This is the first time that Millennium Exchange has been deployed in the cloud, bringing its, scalability, flexibility, reliability and seamless direct market access to AAX,” LSEG Technology's CIO Ann Neidenbach was quoted as saying in a statement.  Thor Chan, CEO of AAX, told CoinDesk that the firm started in March 2018 without raising money from external investors, using its own capital to support a now 100-person team, of which 60 percent are developers.  The exchange will take a hybrid approach to the custody of customers' digital assets, combining its own in-house storage solution and third-party institutional custodians.  Asia's Bakkt?  Chan said he believes the partnership with the LSE will expedite the process of on-boarding institutional clients especially from the traditional financial sector for AAX's spot and futures services.  He added that working work with the LSE will allow AAX to gain access to the stock exchange's exclusive partner network that consists of over 300 major banks and financial institutions.  Michael Wong, COO of AAX, told CoinDesk:  ""We are in the progress of discussions with major institutions both from traditional markets and crypto markets as well. ... We have a number of live conversations going on with serious institutional clients right now. But unfortunately, I'm not allowed to disclose any names at this point. ""  Earlier this year, Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, launched Bakkt, a long-awaited market for physically-settled bitcoin futures targeted at institutions. Chan said Bakk'ts tiered system, which requires registered brokers to serve as middlemen, could be a hurdle to widening its client base.  That is where he believes AAX has an edge.  ""It's different. Bakkt has physically delivered contracts. So they need to have a broker network to help do the settlement. It's actually a barrier for them to acquire users,"" Chan said.  On the retail side, AAX uses a similar strategy to exchanges like Huobi or OKEx by enabling peer-to-peer OTC trading as a fiat on-ramp supporting Chinese yuan, U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars.  ""For us, we don't provide any fiat deposit or withdrawal methods for the users,"" Chan said. ""We are not allowed to take deposits or withdrawal from mainland China. That's not compliant to do so. But if it's just a peer-to-peer deal, it's something allowed in mainland China.""  Futures warning  AAX's launch comes just a day after the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) released a warning on exchanges that offer cryptocurrency futures trading in Hong Kong.  Companies or individuals who offer crypto futures contracts without a proper license or authorization may be considered as breaching the regulation in the city depending on the product structure, the SFC said, adding:  ""Any person who operates a platform that offers or trades 'futures contracts' is required to be licensed or authorized under the SFO unless an exemption applies.""  The SFC has not licensed or authorized any person in Hong Kong to offer crypto futures and added given the risks associated with this type of products, it ""would be unlikely to grant a license or authorization to carry on a business in such contracts.  AAX's current Terms of Use states that it will not offer services to users from various jurisdictions including the U.S., Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, or any other countries sanctioned by the U.S. or the EU, though it does not include Hong Kong users in the restriction list.  In a response to the SFC's latest warning, the company said:  ""We welcome the SFC's latest guidance on virtual asset futures contracts.

In a letter posted on his WeChat feed Wednesday, Zhan publicly addressed what he described as a coup without consent for the first time. Last week, fellow co-founder Jihan Wu told all Bitmain staff in a surprising email that Zhan had been dismissed from all of his roles, and forbade employees from engaging with him.  Wu further revealed an ugly power struggle between him and Zhan during Bitmain’s all-hands meeting on Tuesday last week following the initial email to the staff. Zhan did not immediately issue any statement or respond to requests for comment from multiple media outlets, including CoinDesk.  But in Wednesday's statement, Zhan said he was ousted from the company without any consent or prior knowledge, and he plans to resolve the issue through legal methods. He will take Bitmain on in court if needed.  ""I have never thought that as a person focusing on technology and product, I have to start thinking from legal perspectives. It was embarrassing that as a Bitmain co-founder, the biggest shareholder, and a registered legal representative, I got ousted without any knowledge in this coup while on a business trip,"" he wrote, adding:  ""I didn't realize until then that those scenes in TV shows, where you get stabbed on your back by those partners you trusted and 'brothers' you fought together with, can really happen in real life.""  While the letter did not state whom it's specifically addressing, Zhan told Bitmain staffers and shareholders to be assured that he will ""return to the company as soon as possible through legal methods to end this very critical moment.""  ""Bitmain is our child. I will fight for her till the end with legal weapons. I won't allow those who want to plot against Bitmain to succeed. If someone wants a war, we will give them one,"" he said.
