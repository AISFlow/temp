42397396,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RpW,1394147978,"Vault of Satoshi Halts US Bitcoin Exchange Service, Cites Worsening US Regulatory Conditions","Toronto-based bitcoin exchange Vault of Satoshi, announced via its Facebook account on 6th March that it will cease its US operations effective immediately.  Most notable, however, was the reasoning the company gave for the abrupt move. It suggested that the changing attitudes of US regulators were to blame for the service shutoff.  Citing a recent ""Let's Talk Bitcoin"" Interview with Charlie Shrem, the company elaborated on its reasoning, saying:  ""We feel the regulatory environment in the US is becoming increasingly hostile toward Bitcoin, and more specifically toward exchanges trading in digital currencies.""  In the post, Vault of Satoshi spoke out harshly against the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which it said has made it ""impossible"" to run its business in a way that is compliant with regulations.    ""We’ve made repeated attempts to comply with FinCEN regulations, but their online form submission process will not allow us to post reports from our headquarters in Ontario, Canada.      They refuse to accept printed paper reports, and their drop-downs don’t include Canadian options, making it impossible to the file the required documentation properly in order to comply.""    Despite repeated attempts to gain clarity from FinCEN on how it could best move ahead with its regulatory compliance in light of these issues, the company said its questions have gone unanswered.  The statements are notable given that fellow exchange CoinTrader recently had its accounts closed by a partner bank in Canada. At the time, CoinTrader cited the worsening regulatory environment in Canada as the impetus for its partner bank's decision to cut its services.  The high cost of compliance  In addition to the lack of clarity from major regulatory bodies, Vault of Satoshi suggested that the state-by-state requirements for operating an exchange in the US were the biggest roadblocks. The company described setup and compliance costs for this process as ""astronomical"".  Yet, Vault of Satoshi didn't close the door to its US business permanently, saying it will ""be exploring re-launching on a state-by-state basis"".  Still, it noted that no timeline for such an action is yet in place.  What's next for customers  Vault of Satoshi also detailed how service would change for current US-based customers in the post, suggesting they would only be able to conduct coin-to-coin trading, a service that is not yet launched on the site but that will debut in the coming weeks.  US customers that were in the process of being verified will not be able to complete this process. The company did issue a timeline for when customers could expect refunds to be given.  ""Any dollars currently in your account will be refunded to you via check, which you should receive within [two to three] weeks’ time.""  Vault of Satoshi was also apologetic to its users for the service setback, suggesting that the decision, while in the best interest of its business, was not made lightly.  ""We deeply regret that we can no longer service your cryptocurrency exchange needs, and we’ll do everything we can to re-gain your business and re-launch in your country in the near future, stronger than ever before.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/06/vault-of-satoshi-halts-us-bitcoin-exchange-service-cites-worsening-us-regulatory-conditions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f4a7956d8d903e617251a9e5ccb88441e746fd4-1170x716.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397395,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RmZ,1394131876,"Russia’s Anti-Bitcoin Stance May Be Softening, Reports Say","The Bank of Russia has issued a formal response to a letter penned by a citizen requesting more detail on its alleged banning of digital currencies this past February, reports suggest.  The letter asserts that a meeting of top Russian financial authorities in February did not result in a bitcoin ban, but rather was devoted to “combating crimes in the sphere of the economy devoted to the use of anonymous payment systems and cryptocurrencies on the territory of Russia”.  The statement has appeared translated into English on Bitcoin In Russia, and in Russian on BTCRussia, and Habrahabr, among other sources.  Translations of the posted letter indicate that the goal of the meeting was also to “develop a unified approach to the determination of the legal status of cryptocurrencies”.  Furthermore, the letter indicated that meeting attendees “discussed future directions for the legal regulation of the sphere of cryptocurrencies”, including establishing property rights for citizens and organisations in the field and introducing regulation for their use.  A translation of the letter posted online reads:  “Thus the position of the meeting was not to prohibit all operations related to cryptocurrencies, the main goal was the preparation and realization of a complex of measures to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in illegal operations, including those related to the legalization (laundering) of proceeds from crime, as well as improving the regulatory framework to protect the rights of citizens and organizations using cryptocurrencies.”  The statements were addressed to Valery Alexandrovich, who sent a letter to the bank following its February statements.  Changing tone  The document runs counter to past statements from Russia’s General Prosecutor's Office, which had previously indicated that the use of any monetary instruments other than the Russian ruble is expressly prohibited.  The February announcement stated:  “The anonymous payment systems and crypto-currencies, including bitcoin – which is the most popular of them – are monetary surrogates. As such, their use by private citizens or legal entities is not allowed.”  Those statements were said to have been approved at a meeting comprising representatives from the Bank of Russia (also called the Central Bank of the Russian Federation) and the Russian Interior Ministry, among others. However, in light of the new document, they may more accurately reflect written law in the way that California does not formally allow alternatives to the US dollar.  Representatives from major bitcoin exchange BTC-e, which broke ties with a RUR service provider following the announcement, suggest that Russia’s central bank “never banned” bitcoin, and that the statements were “just a warning”.    BTC-e indicates that the letter is consistent with how “procedures work in [Russia]”, suggesting that Russia’s evolution on the issue has been similar to most other nations.      It offered the following timeline as an explanation for how events are developing in the country:      1. [Central bank] makes warning, sometimes in very strict words due lack of understanding the issue.    2. After the warning, bunch of requests of clarifications from the users of that country goes to the authority.    3. Authority from some number of requests start do homework better and research the issue more carefully.    4. Authority adjust previously made warning with clarification what exactly allowed and what is not.            Regulatory impact  As Russia’s supposed ban had been seen as among the more aggressive actions taken against digital currencies, it may have exerted some influence on global regulators, though no countries have acted as a result of the February statements.  Neighbouring nations such as Estonia, Kazakhstan and Lithuania, for example, appear to be looking to the EU for direction.  The alleged ban seems to have had a slight impact in the US, however. Senator Joe Manchin, for example, cited Russia’s policy in a letter to top US regulators last week, along with the harsh measures adopted by China and Thailand.  However, given the initial reaction to Russian policy, a reversal of such a stance would likewise carry an equivalent influence in the global community.

42397393,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RnY,1394127716,Bitstamp Audit Proves it was Behind $147 Million Mystery Bitcoin Wallet,"Bitstamp  , one of the largest bitcoin exchanges by volume, released the results of a financial audit on 6th March conducted in November and December of 2013.  The release comes one week after Bitstamp issued a joint statement together with other prominent bitcoin businesses calling for the industry to become more transparent in the wake of escalating issues at Mt. Gox.  Led by Firestartr.co, the audit required the creation of the largest single bitcoin wallet and transaction in history. In doing so, it also validated Bitstamp's internal auditing practices.  It read:  ""The report identified that Bitstamp held 100% of validated BTC balance and USD funds. No material issues were raised as a consequence of the investigations.""  CEO Nejc Kodrič spoke to CoinDesk about the news, indicating the audit will become a regular routine for his company, saying: ""Future audits will be conducted quarterly with results published on the Bitstamp website.""  Kodrič also projected this process would ""raise the bar"" for other exchanges to follow suit.  $147m mystery transfer solved  Notably, the audit also confirmed that Bitstamp was the entity behind the transfer of 194,933 BTC into a single bitcoin wallet back in November.  At the time, the transaction, which represented 1.6% of all bitcoins, sparked widespread speculation in the industry, including claims that the real Satoshi Nakamoto was behind the transfer.  Bitstamp was suggested as a possible originator of the transaction, though Kodrič declined to comment to CoinDesk on the rumours at the time.  First audit of many  The release of the audit as part of rolling process is also noteworthy as it could help set a new precedent for bitcoin businesses, becoming a necessary part of proving legitimacy and increasing customer satisfaction.  Bitcoin wallet provider Coinkite released an audit on 24th February, stating at the time that it believed ""web wallets, exchanges and websites holding your funds should provide proof of reserves"".  Furthermore, the joint statement it issued in the wake of Mt. Gox was also signed by Jess Powell, CEO of Kraken; Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China; Nicolas Cary, CEO of Blockchain.info; and Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle Internet Financial.  This statement suggests more audits from major bitcoin companies could be forthcoming as the industry looks to ease consumer concerns and remove long-held mysteries about how exchanges operate.

42397408,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4S2J,1394123795,"Denial, Outrage and Acceptance: Reactions to Satoshi Nakamoto's 'Unmasking'","Update 8:51 GMT: Bitcoin Foundation board member Gavin Andresen has posted an open letter to the report author on reddit.  Update 7:30 GMT: Bitcoin Financial Association member Bruce Fenton has offered to charter a plane for Satoshi Nakamoto, as part of comments meant to encourage the community to protect the alleged bitcoin founder.  Newsweek returned to print edition this week with an article that was sure to grab attention and stir controversy: the announcement that its two-month investigation had revealed the creator bitcoin – a 64-year-old Japanese American with a love for privacy and model trains named Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto.  Unsurprisingly, the declaration sent tremors through the bitcoin community and drew a range of reactions, though the most vocal were those who protested the report and the methods of its author Leah McGrath Goodman.  Chief among the author's critics was Bitcoin lead developer and Bitcoin Foundation board member Gavin Andresen, who indicated that he now regrets talking to the journalist. The report revealed an email message that suggested that Andresen had an early role in promoting the notion that Nakamoto was a ""shadowy figure"", and that Andresen's relationship with Nakamoto ended abruptly.    I'm disappointed Newsweek decided to dox the Nakamoto family, and regret talking to Leah.      — Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) March 6, 2014    Though the article did not confirm conclusively that Nakamoto was the long-sought inventor of Bitcoin, certain statements by the story's subject suggest this is the most plausible, if not exactly desirable, conclusion. Said Nakamoto in perhaps the piece's most notable quote:  ""I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.""  Goodman soon took to Twitter to defend her story, offering to answer questions about the article.  2/2 For those of you who have serious questions for me and/or @Newsweek about the piece, I will do my best to answer them. #Bitcoin — Leah McGrath Goodman (@truth_eater) March 6, 2014  At press time, the tweet had garnered roughly 15 questions seeking responses. These included queries as to why Goodman had elected to release potentially sensitive personal information on her subject and if Nakamoto had contacted her since the article's release. Though, the tweets arguably best succeeded in capturing the range of reactions observed in the community.  Denial  Despite the implications of the quote from Nakamoto, there are some in the community who were incredulous that bitcoin's inventor would reveal himself so easily, especially given the elaborate protections afforded by his principal invention.  On reddit, the community was quick to suggest that finding Nakamoto would not bring any benefit to its creator or the bitcoin movement, but rather detract from the currency's decentralized stance.  Former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem told CoinDesk that he is among those who believe the real Nakamoto is still out there, if he exists at all:  ""I find it hard to believe that a guy who's name is Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto who went sooo far, farther than anyone I know to hide is anonymity, signed messages with PGP, used a throw away email address, avoided all emails about his personal life, worked for the US government, would use his REAL name on potentially the most groundbreaking technological innovation of our time.""  Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik also suggested that the article isn't conclusive in its findings, telling CoinDesk:  ""This Newsweek article is no more, or less, credible than other articles supposing to find Satoshi. It offers zero credible evidence that he designed bitcoin. We will know Satoshi by his digital signatures: the ""real"" Satoshi can easily prove their identity by (a) signing a message with his well-known PGP key, or (b) signing a message using bitcoins presumed to be mined and held by Satoshi.""  Outrage  The loudest protests were heard from members of the bitcoin community on reddit that suggested the article went too far in terms of the amount of information it provided on an individual that they did not firmly connect to the project.  These community members point to the fact that the article revealed Nakamoto's address, license plate number and estimated personal fortune as well as detailed information about his family members.  The result, they say, is that Nakamoto, regardless of his connection to bitcoin, could be at risk.  Goodman defended these actions on Twitter, stating that such information is already public for those who wish to access it.  @EntropyExtropy Good question. Pictures and info people are asking about (including residence and car) already public. His name too.#Bitcoin — Leah McGrath Goodman (@truth_eater) March 6, 2014  Further, photos of Nakamoto, Goodman said, served the purpose of highlighting his humble lifestyle.    @paulrobichaux Yes, there were. We felt showing he lives humbly, despite his achievement, was both telling and inspiring. #Bitcoin      — Leah McGrath Goodman (@truth_eater) March 6, 2014    Other reddit commentators suggested retaliatory actions against Goodman, though these were brushed aside by others who cautioned that any such actions could further shift the public narrative on bitcoin in a negative direction.  Acceptance  For others, the announcement was less jarring and more inevitable given the media sensation that bitcoin has become over the last year. Goodman received her fair share of praise for the piece, even from bitcoin users, some who suggested that this provided answers to long unanswered questions.    @truth_eater people may disagree on methods, but at the end of the day, we all very much wanted to know      — Nick Doiron (@mapmeld) March 6, 2014    Famed bitcoin investor Roger Ver, speaking to Wired, was more intrigued by the news. He did not provide any comment as to whether the story was accurate, but suggested he found it ""interesting if it turned out Satoshi Nakamoto was the real name the entire time.""  One reddit user chose to look at the event in the context of history, suggesting that great creators and bound to be tied to their inventions, for better or for worse.

So, maybe it’s time to forget all this negativity and just have some fun.  By day, bitcoin fanatic Scott Rose is a developer at FileMaker in Austin, Texas; by night, he's a comedian. Rose believes strongly in bitcoin’s potential to change our world for the better, but he can also see the funny side of his obsession. So, he makes videos.  They “primarily make fun of my own bitcoin enthusiasm with a little bit of self-deprecating humour,” he says.  Rose claims people often overlook the amazing, positive developments happening in the bitcoin world, as well as the incredibly innovative and supportive community that is building around the currency.  To paraphrase Mark Twain, he adds, “The reports of bitcoin’s death have been greatly exaggerated.""  Rose considers his ‘Shit Bitcoin Fanatics Say’ videos a “special gift to the bitcoin community, to lift their spirits with laughter when things seem low”.

42397392,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Rkb,1394115217,Upcoming Version of Bitcoinj Software Will Use Tor Network,"Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn says that an upcoming version of bitcoinj will route all connections via the Tor anonymity network.  Bitcoinj is the software behind some of the most popular bitcoin apps and wallets, while Tor is the biggest and most popular anonymity network on the planet.  A pseudo-anonymous digital currency and an anonymous network which routes data through several servers sound like a match made in heaven, at least for some users.  Hearn claims transactions made using the new version of bitcoinj will be sent through Tor's system of three encrypted hops, bouncing encrypted communication through a network of relays around the world. The end result is clear – a completely anonymous transaction.  Security over anonymity  Hearn's plan is bound to get a lot of flak from bitcoin critics, as it could be used for all sorts of questionable practices. However, the idea behind routing bitcoinj through Tor has more to do with security than anonymity.  Hearn told Forbes that the integration will be ready for public use in roughly one month. He also revealed that he developed the prototype in January and is working alongside another famed, but anonymous bitcoin developer – devrandom. Hearn said:  “The fact I use Bitcoin isn’t a secret, but I don’t want all my transactions in an NSA database. When I use Bitcoin in a bar, I don’t want someone on the local network to learn my balance. The way Bitcoin is used today, both those things are possible.”  He also points out that bitcoin is not as anonymous as many people assume. The public ledger is out there for all to see, hence it is possible to trace transactions and even reveal the identities of those behind them.  By monitoring internet traffic it is possible to trace the transaction back to the IP address where it originated. Therefore, some organisations can learn the true identity of bitcoin users. Hearn says it is possible that the NSA and GCHQ have already 'de-anonymised' most of the block chain.  Could Tor fend off criminals?  Since Tor bounces traffic through a number of proxies around the world, this would not be easy to do with bitcoinj on the Tor network. At the moment, attackers can use untrusted WiFi networks to stage attacks by spoofing the bitcoin network and tricking the user into accepting bitcoins that don't even exist.  However, Hearn cautions that there is no silver bullet and that the Tor network is just part of the solution. Both Hearn and Mastercoin's Peter Todd point to Bloom Filters as another attack vector.  Bloom Filters were designed to make bitcoin wallets more efficient and seek out transactions relevant to the user, but in the process they also bleed a lot of information that could be used by attackers.  Hearn argues that Bloom Filters will be updated in future Bitcoin implementations to reveal less information. He maintains that the filters can be sorted out and views Tor as a more important step in protecting privacy.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/06/upcoming-version-of-bitcoinj-software-will-use-tor-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22cc92d0909897cd79bf7df53e0868bc5e64dbbc-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397394,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RoX,1394111253,Bitcoin Inventor Satoshi Nakamoto 'Found' in California,"Ever since bitcoin was created five years ago, the crypto community has been trying to find out the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. Many tried and failed, so eventually Satoshi Nakamoto became the Keyser Söze of the bitcoin world.  As the Söze saying goes, the biggest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist. Nakamoto's biggest trick was convincing the world that his name was a pseudonym.  A new report claims it was not.  Newsweek scoop  Newsweek magazine is reviving its print edition this week and it came back in style, with one of the biggest scoops in bitcoin history (if it turns out to be true, that is). Newsweek's Leah McGrath Goodman apparently managed to find the real Satoshi Nakamoto, and what's even more surprising is that the humble man behind the cryptocurrency craze was hiding in plain sight.  The real Satoshi is not a Tokyo whiz kid, nor a spy or a group of developers – there was never any mystery, or pseudonym. He is 64-year-old Satoshi Nakamoto, a Californian with a love of math, encryption and model trains, McGrath Goodman claims. His background is not entirely clear, but he apparently worked on classified projects for major corporations and the US military.  He is not living out his days sipping cocktails and spending his bitcoin fortune on the French Riviera, either. Nakamoto lives in Temple City, California, in his humble family home. Not what you would expect from a man who is said to hold $400m in bitcoins.  Not too keen to talk  According to McGrath Goodman, Nakamoto was never after fame and was not thrilled when the Newsweek reporter showed up at his home. In fact, he called the police. The police officers were surprised to learn that the 64-year-old was the ""real McCoy"".  He suggested he played a role in the development of bitcoin, but refused to say anything else.  ""I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,"" he told the reporter. ""It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.""  Nobody knew, not even his family, not even his friends or locals. His brother told Newsweek he is a ""brilliant man"", but also a reclusive man who doesn't like to talk about his work. He added that he would never acknowledge his involvement in bitcoin.  Newsweek tracked Nakamoto down through one of the companies he used to buy components for model steam trains. He gets the parts from Japan and England, he has been working with model trains since his teens and he does the machining himself.  He clearly does not want to spend his time talking to reporters, he has better things to do.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/06/bitcoin-inventor-satoshi-nakamoto-found-in-california,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99b56db7567789b4f3d4227aeb38d40fef537cf1-1200x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397403,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RwP,1394099778,New Toronto Accelerator to Invest $250k in Bitcoin Startups,"The second cryptocurrency accelerator has opened in north America this week, this time in Toronto, targeting entrepreneurs working in ""second generation cryptocurrencies"".  Bitcoin Decentral Accelerate  will begin with a $250,000 fund, but hopes to score at least $1.5m in investment to sustain its first eight months of operation, according to its organizers.  The accelerator, launched by Bitcoin Alliance of Canada founder Anthony Di Iorio, is a spinoff of Bitcoin Decentral, the coworking space that has been operating since 1st January.  The venture will target both bitcoin entrepreneurs, and also those working on what Di Iorio calls the next wave of cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (with which he is also involved).  What are second generation cryptocurrencies? ""Ones like Mastercoin, Open Transactions, and Ethereum, that aren't just about bitcoins sending and receiving money,"" he explained. But as the name suggests, the accelerator will be welcoming bitcoin entrepreneurs too.  Di Iorio has not yet approached VCs about the accelerator, but is confident they will invest, because of existing conversations that he has shared with them about Ethereum, the cryptocurrency framework that will launch officially sometime next month.  Three cohorts  For now, the accelerator plans an initial three cohorts, running for around three months each. Each of these will contain nine companies, Di Iorio said. The first cohort will be announced at the bitcoin expo that he has organized for 11th – 13th April.  The accelerator will take a 7% equity stake in participating companies, which may be paid in cryptocurrency in addition to fiat. The amount that it pays for that equity stake is likely to vary from firm to firm. Once they graduate, they'll get an additional investment commitment that will seed their follow-on round.  The criteria for acceptance include a prototype, and either market traction, or feedback from a significant test base. The accelerator also requires a team that has worked together and executed successfully.  ""The focus is also bitcoin, or something disruptive, in finance fields, payments fields, things like that,"" Di Iorio said.  Hackathons will also come into play, he added, hopefully producing some promising candidates for the cohort. One such hackathon is currently running at the Bitcoin conference in Austin.  Expert Panel  Ultimately, cohort selections will be made by a panel of participants including the three founders, along with a potential collection of mentors from the broader network.  Also involved in the project is A. Traviss Corry, who founded the InCubes accelerator.  William Mougayar  , founder of Startup Management, will act as special advisor to the accelerator, and will also be part of a network of mentors.  The mentor network is a who's who of bitcoin players, including BitPay's Tony Gallippi, Bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees, and Charles Hoskinson, who along with Di Iorio is one of the driving forces behind Ethereum.  Di Iorio is also hoping for additional funding from Ethereum in addition to the $1.5m he's going to be asking for from other private funders.  Billed as a coworking space, Bitcoin Decentral doesn't yet house paying coworking customers. Instead, it houses people working with Di Iorio's Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. The top two floors will be devoted to the accelerator, and will also house the ongoing CoinTalk podcast.  This is a big week for cryptocurrency accelerators.

42425533,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUAth,1394071372,US Congressman Launches Satirical Bid to Ban the US Dollar,"Just over one week ago, US Senator Joe Manchin made headlines when he wrote an open letter to federal regulators calling for an outright ban of bitcoin, and now he has received a tongue-in-cheek response from a fellow politician, Congressman Jared Polis.  The Colorado representative issued a letter today to the same federal regulators that Manchin addressed, and in the letter Polis satirically calls for a ban on the physical US dollar.  Elaborating on his concerns about the dollar, Polis wrote that ""the exchange of dollar bills, including high denomination bills, is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity"", mirroring similar statements made by Manchin about bitcoin.  The West Virgina Senator suggested that the digital currency's value to the US economy is ""suspect, if not outright detrimental”, and urged federal regulators to ban its use in the States before Americans get left ""holding the bag on a valueless currency"".  Drawing similarities between bitcoin and the US dollar  Many opponents of bitcoin argue that its ability to be transacted anonymously lends the digital currency to illicit activity like money laundering. While Polis made no claims against this, he also gave a sound observation that the same properties that make bitcoin susceptible to illicit activities are found in the US national currency.  Wrote Polis:  ""The very features of dollar bills, such as anonymous transactions, have created ubiquitous uses from drug purchases, to hit men, to prostitutes, as dollar bills are attractive to criminals who are able to disguise their actions from law enforcement.""  Notably, one day after Senator Manchin urged regulators to ban bitcoin, Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen issued her very first statement regarding the digital currency, stating that the Federal Reserve doesn't have the authority to ""supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way"".  Inspiring meaningful conversation about bitcoin regulation  Congressman Polis' request to ban the US dollar is admittedly made in jest, but Polis hopes that his letter to regulators incites meaningful conversation in the US government about regulation of bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Polis said:    ""As digital currencies like bitcoin become more popular, the level of awareness will increase in Congress as well.      It's important to continue to establish the basic fact that the dollar is the currency of choice for cartels, criminals and illicit transactions and is likely to stay that way for the forseable future.""    As bitcoin continues to gain awareness with the public both in the US and abroad, the issue of governmental regulation is becoming difficult to avoid. Mt. Gox's recent filing for bankruptcy is one example where government regulation arguably could have improved customer protections, and many people in the industry suggest that a regulatory framework may be necessary in bringing digital currencies to mainstream adoption.  Polis said that while he believes digital currencies like bitcoin will continue to gain traction around the world, he doesn't expect them to replace government issued fiat currencies, at least not in the near future:    ""I think that digital currencies, whether it is Bitcoin other existing digital currencies, have many advantages over government currencies.      I think there will be an increased role for digital currencies over timem but I doubt that they will replace government issued currencies any time soon.""    The future of bitcoin regulation is yet to be seen, but with more politicians like Congressman Polis and Senator Manchin voicing their opinions about the digital currency, it is becoming clear that governments are starting to take the issue more seriously, for better or for worse.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Tom Sharkey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2014/03/06/us-congressman-launches-satirical-bid-to-ban-the-us-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e1365e86b3ac6f2a520dd7fd800dc43b8fc839f-942x718.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
