On the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Diana, a blockchain startup, is launching a “lunar registry” that attempts to place the lunar surface on a distributed ledger.  The project is offering collective ownership of Earth’s only natural satellite through dividing the moon into 3,874,204,892 cells encoded on a blockchain by a 3-word address. Proof of stake in this “cadastral map” is represented by two tokens, dia and mond.    We come in pieces    Following the launch of the Diana blockchain, the startup also plans to develop a decentralized autonomous organization and eventually an exchange to build an economy around the orbital celestial object.  Dia, a native token distributed upon registration, will be exchangeable with mond, intended for transactions. Accordingly, registration costs will increase as more tokens are sold, which will “boost” the value of tokens for market participants and prevent speculation.  Fifty percent of the tokens will be made publicly available, while less than 2 percent will be reserved for the founders and development team, and the rest will act as a reserve.  Tokens will be held in “noun.verb.noun” addresses. “diana.love.BTS, i.am.yourfather, and amstrong.land.Moon,” are given as possible examples.    The dark side of the moon    The project’s white paper quotes Article II of the UN Outer Space Treaty:  ""Outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.""  Yet, the founders point out this treaty says nothing about “private ownership” or parceling of the solar system, noting that many sovereign nations, like China, and capital-rich corporations, like Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, are gearing up to explore – and perhaps monopolize – humanity’s shared heritage.  The project leads think this next-gen space race will inevitably lead to the question of “who owns the moon.”  “Given the increased possibility of ownership disputes,” Diana is currently offering tokenized ownership of the visible lunar surface – a chance for everyone to get a slice.  As part of the project roadmap, the team hopes to establish a Together Moon Foundation, appoint an international and space expert defense team, and ""develop the biz model for Moon possession.""

42403110,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAded7Q,1563616828,Anchorage Chose South Dakota for Its Crypto Custody – Here's Why,"During a tense Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday, in which Facebook blockchain lead David Marcus was skewered over the social media company's ambitious Libra project, Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) started his remarks with a brief announcement:  ""Mr. Marcus, thanks very much for appearing here before us today. Before I begin my questions, I just want to take a moment to commend the South Dakota Division of Banking for their forward-thinking and willingness to allow for innovation in the digital currency space. Another founding member of the Libra Association, Anchorage, just received permission from the Division of Banking to become a South Dakota chartered trust company.""  Observers may have found it odd given the tenor of the hearing, but indeed, Rounds had it right. ""Anchorage, which is a Silicon Valley crypto startup,"" he said, ""has chosen to open its second headquarters in Sioux Falls.""  Amidst the fear, uncertainty and doubt hanging over the hearings, Anchorage was improbably enjoying its moment in the sun.  The startup recently raised a $40 million Series B on the promise of crypto custody services for institutional investors that are ""both more secure and more usable."" Anchorage's technology avoids the traditional dichotomy of internet-connected hot wallets and offline cold storage in favor of specialized hardware security modules (HSMs). The company's custom HSMs ""will process a given transaction only when certain criteria are met,"" according to a company blog post from April.  In June, Anchorage also snagged a seat at the table of the Libra Association alongside some of the world’s most powerful brands. (Anchorage investors Andreessen Horowitz and Visa are also founding members of Libra's initial 28-company consortium.)  CoinDesk spoke with Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley the day after the Senate hearing about why shopping jurisdictions made sense and what the benefits of launching a subsidiary in South Dakota are expected to be.  While Wyoming is perhaps the most notable state to court the crypto industry, others have also joined in. Montana passed a crypto-friendly securities law in May. In South Dakota, Anchorage is following in the footsteps of fellow crypto custodian BitGo, which got the green light from state regulators in 2018.  Below is an edited transcript of our discussion.      The cost of living is among the lowest in the U.S. and there are no income taxes, but are there specific reasons you selected South Dakota for your new Anchorage Trust subsidiary?  South Dakota knows trust administration, and that kind of institutional memory means abundant access to legal counsel, auditors, office space and talent. There were others states we talked with where a trust company hadn't been created in over a decade, and ""over a decade"" was considered recent.  From top to bottom the state is really interested in seeing innovation happen. The South Dakota Trust Charter allows companies to operate on a national level so you can serve clients from every state. There is regulatory clarity that allows crypto natives to increase yields for clients through baking, staking and other kinds of participation. And surprisingly, South Dakota is one of the largest holders of assets in the country, more than $3 trillion, according to the FDIC, three times the size of New York, second only to Ohio.  It’s also a really nice business climate. We’re hosting a ribbon-cutting ceremony in a few weeks and the local chamber of commerce is helping put it together.  How long did it take to get the charter?  We were motivated to do it quickly because from the get-go we knew we wanted to be a qualified custodian for our institutional-investor clients. Initial contact was late December. We met with the Division of Banking three or four days before Christmas and we received our charter on July 16, so it took six, seven months.  Who else is part of the South Dakota crypto community?  BitGo and Kingdom Trust are here as well.  What challenges do you foresee at the federal level?  SEC broker-dealer guidance  continues to be a work in progress. We’re in good shape because of our licensure but more regulatory clarity is needed for the industry.  Any plans to expand internationally?  Right now our focus is on the United States because the U.S. remains the center of gravity for institutional investment, but we’re open to conversations with folks from the EU and Asia as many of them are interested in working with a U.S.-based custodian.  You recently deepened your ties with fellow Libra Association members Visa and Andreessen Horowitz, which are both investors in your Series B round. What are you most excited about going forward?  The investment from Visa is an important part of our story because it speaks to the kind of investor we're attracting and the growing interest in cryptocurrency. It’s also very exciting that social networks like Facebook are getting involved in cryptocurrency to make financial services available to a larger portion of the population in a user-friendly way.  We’re just thrilled to be part of it.

42403087,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdedBM,1563612326,Could Donald Trump Ban Bitcoin?,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in crypto assets. Sign up here.      Bitcoin yet again graced global headlines last week, after the President of the United States, Donald Trump, took to Twitter to declare himself “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies, “whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”  The ensuing discussion largely celebrated the global attention and the fact that bitcoin is now important enough for one of the most powerful men in the world to make a public statement about it. And the crypto markets seemed to shrug it off, signaling with their relative indifference that they have bigger things to worry about.  One potential conversation that has been largely overlooked is how vulnerable bitcoin is to governments the size of the United States. Now that bitcoin has Trump’s attention, will more incendiary statements follow? Will he declare it a “bad idea” that needs ""dealing with?"" That would not be out of character.  The knee-jerk reaction to the possibility of a bitcoin ban is “yeah, just try it.” Many believe that a ban would be unconstitutional. Most insist that, even if passed, it would have no impact.  These assumptions are bold, largely unchallenged, and deserve a closer look as they mask confusion over what bitcoin is, and how far the influence of the world’s largest economy reaches.  In essence, Trump can try to ban bitcoin. If successful, the ban could have a material impact on the technology’s value. But, he won’t.  (Please note that I am not a lawyer, and there are nuances to every interpretation. Also, I hold a modest amount of bitcoin with no short positions and therefore have no interest in spreading FUD. But investors of all types have to be aware of risks, and the real danger lurks in those we don’t even think about.)  Code is not speech  First, let’s look at how he could do so. Many claim that a ban on using the bitcoin code is a ban on civil liberties. Code is speech, the argument goes, and as such is protected by the First Amendment.  This is not nearly as clear as it seems. Contrary to popular opinion, there has been no official statement supporting the claim – the Bernstein case so often cited, in which a judge upheld the claim that the government could not stop the publication of code, was superseded by appeals and eventually dismissed without an official ruling.  While code may have some elements of speech, in that it can be used to express and communicate, code is also very different. Unlike speech, it executes actions, which can be (and often are) regulated by law, with official enforcement.  Also, writing code as a form of expression is in itself as harmless as speaking your mind. But bitcoin users aren’t writing code, they are executing it. They are taking an action, which could theoretically be declared illegal. And given the public blockchain’s transparency, this would not be impossible to enforce.  Given the size and reach of the U.S. market, its absence from the bitcoin ecosystem would be felt, and not just in the price. Fungibility would come into question – the risk of accepting a bitcoin that a few hops ago was in a U.S.-based wallet could lead to the emergence of parallel markets for “verifiably clean” coins. And the risk of inadvertently sending a payment to a U.S.-based person or entity could push transactions into more expensive and even more traceable vehicles.  Size and might  If Trump is persuaded that going after the bitcoin protocol would be futile, he could still decide to clamp down on cryptocurrency businesses. While it is difficult to stop independent enterprises from handling assets that are not illegal, the imposition of a slew of compliance and fiscal requirements could render such projects no longer viable.  And as we saw with the handling of the U.S. approach to Iran sanctions – the threat of retaliation against any company, no matter its jurisdiction, that violated the ban on trade – it is possible that an aggressive stance from the issuer of the world’s reserve currency could force other sovereign nations to capitulate.  In other words, in the face of a U.S. clampdown, bitcoin would not disappear – its code and operation are decentralized, and the advantages of the technology will always give it some demand – but its potential could be curtailed.  However, this bleak scenario overlooks one important detail: banning bitcoin is not in Trump’s interest.  Play to the base  It’s not so much the colossal fight that a bitcoin ban would get in the courts at all levels that would dissuade him – he has not shied away from that before. More likely to worry him is the alienation of a significant part of his constituency.  Apart from the dissonance of the most anti-establishment president in recent memory attempting to squelch one of this century’s most anti-establishment technologies, one of his electoral pacts was to roll back financial regulation and encourage innovation. Weakening his self-styled image as both a disruptor and a free-market evangelist could damage his voters’ trust and hurt him in the polls.  What’s more, some major Trump-supporting states have spent considerable time and effort in positioning themselves as crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Even Trump’s core team has its converts: his acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, was an early supporter of cryptocurrencies.  While it could be argued that clamping down on bitcoin would be more a step to protect the dollar than an encroachment of federal power (although the administration seems to see Facebook’s Libra as a greater threat), the precedent of trying to stop a particular non-violent use of code will make many enterprises both in and out of finance uncomfortable.  And most of “Wall Street,” the traditional financial institutions that Trump seems to want to cultivate through his fiscal and economic policies, has an interest in bitcoin, through either the development of crypto operations or the investment preferences of institutional clients.  There’s also the allegedly substantial federal holdings through bitcoin seizures to consider.  While Trump’s decisions don’t always seem driven by reason, we should accept that he is an astute politician and is unlikely to embark on a path that could lose him votes and donors.  The upside  The most important takeaway from Trump’s outburst is that bitcoin’s significance has now reached presidential level. While this may elevate the risk of negative repercussions, it also brings forward the potential, highlighting how far the concept has come: once an obscure and complex idea developed by a niche group of coders, bitcoin is now a global phenomenon that has attracted not just support from investors and corporations of all types, but also the attention of world leaders.  In the extremely unlikely event that Trump decides to go after bitcoin, either at the protocol level or on the service layer, he will certainly be vociferously challenged in the courts. The hearings could generate debilitating uncertainty, but at the same time they would push the conversation even further along the path of regulatory clarity, and the resulting decisions on limits to federal power, the freedom inherent in code and even an official recognition of the potential of cryptocurrency will impact tech development at all levels.  I’ve said before that one of the strongest appeals of bitcoin for investors is its asymmetric risk: the chance that it will go to zero (and the impact that would have on a portfolio) is less than the chance its price will increase 10x.  We have here another type of asymmetric risk. The chance that Trump will try to ban bitcoin is not zero, but it is significantly less than the benefit to the ecosystem of the heightened level of conversation. Even though the road may be bumpy, when the President of the United States of America tweets about a decentralized store of value designed to circumvent the power of established finance, it’s hard to deny that the zeitgeist has shifted.
