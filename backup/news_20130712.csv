42425011,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAHh,1373648432,Instawallet closes claims process and Bitcoin-24 encounters problems in Poland,"We have two nuggets of refund news for you today. First up, Instawallet has officially closed its claims process, after opening it 91 days ago.  The bitcoin wallet was created in April 2011 and was designed to offer a speedy alternative to the other available wallets. It required no signup, it simply generated a secret link when users visited the site – this link was then the only way the user's wallet could be accessed.  Fast-forward two years and the site's security was breached, with an intruder gaining access to all of the hidden urls, so the company closed and told customers to file a claim form in order to get their funds back.  Users were told that those with under 50 bitcoins in their account would get a refund, but those with more than this would have their claims dealt with on a ""case by case and best efforts basis"".  Instawallet's latest updatehttps://www.instawallet.org/ explained it is now drawing up a final ""payments table"" which it will then crosscheck with each claimant to make sure no mistakes are made.  Here's the detail the update gave:  Today (July the 11th) at 10PM CEST, after 91 days, the claims submission interface will be disabled  On July the 12th we will handle the claims that came in after our last processing batch and before the cutoff  At the end of that day we'll have a surrogate payouts table  We'll update the claims interface with this data and make it publicly available  We will then proceed to go mind our own business for the week-end  On Friday the 19th of July we'll broadcast a payout for all accepted claims [1]  For three months after this we'll make weekly payouts for the claims that got accepted during the previous considered week  If an offered payout hasn't been accepted three months after the first payouts it'll be considered expired.  [1] Assuming no significant discrepancy or mistake is found in the calculations leading to our proposed payments table before Friday the 19th.  Bitcoin-24  Meanwhile, some Bitcoin-24 (BTC 24) customers are having to wait around to get their funds back too.  The latest statement from the German exchange's lawyers Röhl, Dehm & Partner explains a decision made by the Polish Public Prosecutor's Office that a large proportion of the exchange's money can be returned (but some still cannot).  At the end of April, BTC 24's German and Polish bank accounts were closed following the hacking of customer accounts, suspected fraud and the use of accounts for illegal purposes. The German accounts were reopened in late May, but the Polish authorities have taken more time to mull things over.  The statement from Röhl, Dehm & Partner reads:    Before payments can now be made from the Polish account, those accounts subject to the suspicion of illegal use must be first clearly identified.      But unfortunately this will only be possible once the Polish Public Prosecutor’s Office has given us and our colleagues in Poland access to the files. To protect all profit already earned, it is critical that our client avoid paying out money to those users who are connected with the suspicious accounts.    The statement also explains that all customers entitled to get funds back from the German bank should receive confirmation within the next two weeks.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/12/instawallet-closes-claims-process-and-bitcoin-24-encounters-problems-in-poland,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30e562ba336c3ac63659e46acdcc6ff9aed705be-419x283.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425026,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAjh,1373641210,"Taxing, hacking and the one key innovation to ensure BTC victory","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 12th July 2013 — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law  The UK loves Vikings. And turtles. What about bitcoin?  What made Britain great? The weather? The food? A pragmatic approach to the acquisition of wealth from others? As you munch your cheesy chips in the first sunny spell since last April, you may suspect what the rest of the world knows: if it involves other people’s money, we’d like some, please.  This may not be the public reasoning behind Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs declaring that bitcoin exchangers don’t have to worry about registering as regulated money changers (at least, not yet), but it’s an interesting contrast with the Land-Of-The-Free Californians. They give the impression that if you’ve ever used the letters B, T and C in the same sentence, you should lodge a seven-digit bond or risk losing three of your favourite organs. Over here - hey, let’s give it a go and see what happens.    Perhaps some of the UK’s relaxed attitude comes from being involved with currencies from the groat to two-pound coins containing blue turtles (just don't go into the politics of those) via a system based on three different number bases simultaneously. After all, we currently have eight entirely separate sets of banknotes from eight different issuers on the go. The latest examples of this wild free-for-all are Northern Irish banknotes apparently issued by Vikings: John Law is not sure that the last example of Danegeld portends well.      But the underlying principle is that when people do transactions between themselves in the UK, it’s up to them how they agree the details - and that includes any intermediate bartering. You can force settlement with legal tender - basically, Bank of England notes - but only in England and Wales; otherwise, the state leaves you to it. Anything that makes you richer interests the taxman, anything that involves fraud or terrorism interests the plod, but if you want to buy your Marks and Spencers knickers with dried goat dung and M&S is happy with the idea - go ahead. It would at least make till design more interesting.      And so, the humble bitcoin retains the same legal status as goat dung, at least as far as the money changing laws of the United Kingdom are concerned. Whether this will perk up the great and troubled financial masters of the City - well, we’ll have to wait and see. But for now, the doors are open for the next gold rush. Just bring waterproofs.    A coin of a different colour    New technology is like a child - when it grows up, you stop taking an interest in its internal workings. Bitcoin isn’t there yet, so every fever is a worry, every growth spurt a matter of joy, and every chance to check up on whether it’s doing All Right is a chance taken. (Non-parents will have to remember back to how much more satisfying it was to be proper ill before you had to get your own sorry carcass to the docs.)      So it was very satisfying to read CoinDesk's interview with BTC developer Jeff Garzik, who spends a lot of quality time protecting and nurturing the core code at the heart of the reference Bitcoin system. John Law, whose peak fiscal innovation was during the 18th century when secrecy and running people through with swords was quite the thing, is all in favour of open source: not only is the working there for you to look at if you understand it, the people who make it are entirely free to talk if you do not. Compare that to the hallowed halls of Barclaycard.    Lots of fascinating detail came out, including more tales about how the original Nakamoto code looked (“unconventional”) and how it was turned into something that could stand up to the real world. That meant giving it a more traditional open source structure and group of developers: right now, the process of building up the protocol is similar to how the early Internet core systems evolved. How did that turn out again?  But like all really good developers, Garzik really gets excited about the future - both technical and practical. The developing world could win big, and there’s enormous potential to build mutiple layers of services on top of BTC itself to create an entire financial system.    The thing that John Law likes most, although not as important in big, grown-up terms as some of the other things that Garzik foresees, is coloured coins, slang for attaching stuff to a bitcoin. That stuff can be anything digital - a picture, an ID code, a link, a short video clip of a goat rampaging through Marks and Spencers - and turns the bitcoin into a token. That’s the sort of concrete feature that will help you explain cryptocurrency to your granny, and without which anyone not wired to be comfortable with digital abstraction will prefer to stick to the stuff with pictures of famous dead people on, thanks. (And credit cards and cheques, but they’re obvious, right?)      But don’t hang around here. Go and read the interview.    How to use kittens for global fiscal revolution    That breakthrough technology will be the physical cryptocurrency holder that’s cheap enough to give away in a transaction but secure enough to be accepted on sight. And if the Firmcoin isn’t that technology, it’s certainly very close.      Coming from Argentina - another hotbed of BTC interest - the Firmcoin is a little perspex gizmo that contains a digital wallet, an optional e-ink screen like a tiny Kindle, and a near-field communication transceiver (NFC), like a contactless credit card. When stuck together with the appropriate digital signature code and verification technology, it turns into something rather like a banknote, albeit one that, optionally, you can give whatever value you like.      Indeed, you can think of it like a credit card but without the credit card account, Instead of presenting it for verification and cash deduction, you just give the whole thing over in exchange for your goods or services (potentailly with some change in real cash or another Firmcoin), It gets all its power from the NFC when needed, so doesn’t run out of batteries, and doesn’t need to be in range of any network or authority to be useful.      Although inventor-cryptographer Sergio Lerner doesn’t say, it is almost certainly possible to put a picture of a famous dead person - or even a kitten - on it. Not so much a Lolcat as a Lollycat, perhaps.      If that doesn’t bring the revolution thundering in through the gates ready to park its heels on the desks of power, John Law is at an utter loss to know what more you lot want.

42425021,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAbh,1373632645,"Feathercoin, PhenixCoin and Worldcoin partner to form UNOCS, the United Open Currencies Solutions group","A new altcurrency partnership has just been announced. The United Open Currency Solutions (UNOCS) group consists of Feathercoin (FTC), Phenixcoin (PXC) and WorldCoin (WDC). The three currencies intend to merge their development teams while keeping the three currencies separate. The UNOCS website, has a nine day countdown, indicating there'll be more to find out then.  The three coins are planning to form a complementary set as they have each been created with distinct focuses. For example, Feathercoin aspires to be a cryptocurrency for consumers. This was demonstrated by the Feathercoin marketplace.  Meanwhile, UNOCS states that Phenixcoin has been created for the ""entertainment industry"". In practice, this coin is aimed at gambling sites, such as its own PhenixPoker.com website.  WorldCoin  is a currency built to facilitate cryptocurrency commerce for merchants and businesses. Its website states:  Our major goal is to become the cryptocurrency of choice for merchants and consumers for their everyday transaction, whether it be a cup of coffee or a bigger ticket item. Our speed and security makes all of this possible. WorldCoin is also based on sound money principals which makes it the smart choice for wealth preservation. It is designed to appreciate in value over time, unlike paper currency. This is due to the fact that only x coins will ever be produced. These advantages are what makes us the leading choice for users.  UNOCS told us:    UNOCS is a collaboration between three established currencies in order to provide improved consumer and merchant services. A joint platform to push back technological boundaries and create cutting edge tools that will define the next stage of cryptocurrency adoption.      In the coming weeks strategic solutions, services and applications will be rolled out to facilitate acceptance and wide-scale use of crypto-coin services across all markets. UNOCS intend to create industry standards by working together and pooling our resources to be innovative leaders in this field.    The altcurrencies partnering for UNOCS are all Scrypt based coins. Of all the altcurrency exchanges, only Cryptsy lists all three of the partnered currencies. On that exchange, the bitcoin price for each is as follows: FTC/BTC=0.00086500, PXC/BTC=0.00028127, WDC/BTC=0.00011112. For reference, the bitcoin price of litecoin on Cryptsy was 0.02815001 at the time of writing, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the other prices listed here.  We spoke to Tuur Demeester, Editor of Macrotrends, about the partnership and he told us:    ""Time will tell whether there is something substantial here, but I'm always excited about new initiatives around altcoins. I think it's important to not dismiss altcoin experiments and innovation, but rather to encourage it - this keeps the bitcoin community on its toes and it helps create a more resilient cryptocurrency ecosphere.      ""I'm keeping an eye on what's happening. Over time the altcoin community will start maturing, and I think in the next few years we'll see the emergence of important complementary currencies.""

42425017,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlARh,1373626825,Coinbase opens instant bitcoin transfers for verified customers,"The bitcoin wallet platform Coinbase has now enabled instant bitcoin purchases. Users will have to undergo identity verification, which will unlock instant transfer and larger transaction limits. Coinbase is still limited to the US only, but this move brings it into closer competition with the BitInstant exchange.  Coinbase  imposes transaction limits via so-called user levels. Level 2 accounts have the highest transaction limits. However, as a part of the new instant transfer facility, Coinbase says it has set all users at level 1, and it will require identity verification before anyone can return to level 2 status.  According to comments by a Coinbase representative on Reddit, there are two steps required for verification:    To become level 2 you need to do two things:      1) Make a purchase at level 1, and wait 30 days    2) Complete ID verification, which takes less than 5 minutes    In the ensuing Reddit thread, it was established that no physical ID was required to be submitted. This in turn means that Coinbase would be checking a user's information against their public credit record. Users who had little or no credit rating raised concerns as to whether they would be able to be verified or not. At the time of writing, the Coinbase representative had not responded to those queries, and so the question remains unanswered.  Reddit users who had already gone through Coinbase's identity verification reported that it was a quick process, and at least in case the process was completed in ""less than a minute"".  There are other worries that the requirement for identity verification compromises the anonymity offered by bitcoin. While this is true, it is a trade off with the added convenience of being able to buy and sell bitcoin instantly.  Previously, BitInstant had been the market of choice for instant transfers. However, Coinbase's ease of use and added instant transfers may make it a more desirable option for customers. Perhaps the biggest problem for Coinbase, though, is that it only operates in the US, whereas BitInstant operates in several countries.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/12/coinbase-opens-instant-bitcoin-transfers-for-verified-customers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/248e32ce7e84c607bedc728f6a7039b6910930c1-1000x693.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425014,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlALh,1373624501,"Merchant-friendly payments: less than perfect, but better than before","Bitcoin is due for an overhaul of its payment mechanism to make it more merchant-friendly, but the core dev team is working with an imperfect system, they say.  The basic idea behind the Payment Request initiative is to give Bitcoin a mechanism for sending verified payments directly between people. This doesn’t take transactions away from the blockchain, but it does provide an extra layer of security between merchant and customer. It also makes payments more user-friendly.  The problem with bitcoin payments  In the traditional bitcoin payment system, bitcoins are sent by manually pasting a long, gibberish alphanumeric address into a bitcoin client. Some clients allow for QR codes of addresses to be scanned.  “It’s great technically but it looks like a monkey banging on a keyboard to the average person,” says core developer Jeff Garzik. Aside from being difficult for the average non-techie to understand or use, the gobbledygook address format makes a number of attacks possible. “For example you don't know whether the bitcoin address I gave you is really mine,” he points out.  There is a danger that the address is either inaccurate, or simply fraudulent. I could pretend to be a known legitimate merchant online, or perhaps send a phishing attack asking you for money. If you fell for the scam and paid me, your money would be gone. After all, bitcoin payments are irreversible.  The other problem with existing bitcoin payments is while they are permanently registered in the blockchain, they’re not easy to document when they’re happening. There is no metadata encoded in the payment information itself that says what it’s for. Neither is there any information about a return address for refund purposes. Any refunds have to be arranged separately. And if you want to confirm immediately that your bitcoin payment reached its recipient, then you have to get separate confirmation from them.  A better way  All of this may have seemed reasonable in 2009, but things have moved on. We need something more robust now, argues Pieter Wuille, one of Bitcoin’s seven core developers. “In almost all cases, you are already visiting the merchant's website in order to make an order. It's pretty strange that we're now relying on the (slow, unreliable, expensive and unflexible) peer-to-peer network to get his payment to him, while we could just send it to him directly (faster, cheaper, ability to add metadata to the transaction, and most importantly, an instant confirmation from the merchant that they received it).”  The Payment Requests mechanism will attempt to do just that. Instead of having to send payments to a cumbersome bitcoin address, someone wanting to pay for something in bitcoins can simply wait for a request to be emailed by the merchant, or served via a website. The customer’s bitcoin client uses the information contained in the Payment Request to make a payment, making the payment process more secure.  Payment Requests use digital certificates to try and solve the problem, in the same way that websites use them to prove that the sites are owned and operated by the true owners of a business.  In the dark old days of the Internet, it was easy to visit a web site that you thought was owned by a certain company, (www.microsoft.com, say) only to end up on a fraudulent site run by a scammer (perhaps www. m1cros0ft.com). Many people fell vulnerable to phishing attacks thanks to this flaw. So the industry introduced digital certificates. Sites would serve up these certificates, which were obtained from trusted third party companies called certificate authorities. Browsers would look for the certificates, and throw up an error if it didn’t find them.  Digital certicates in bitcoin payments  The core developers want to use the same basic premise for payments. A merchant will send a payment request to the customer, signed with a digital certificate. It can include information such as an expiry date for the payment, merchant-specific data such as an invoice number, a plain text note, and a URL to send payment to. None of this information was available in a standard bitcoin payment before, because there wasn’t a payment request. The customer would simply send bitcoins off into the ether, hoping that they were landing with the right person.  In the new system, the customer will send their payment to the merchant, encoded with extra information, including some of the information in the payment request as a reference, along with a refund address in the event that the merchant needs to send funds back.  It’s all very grown-up, and something that Bitcoin has long needed, which is why it’s been on the drawing board for the last year or two. But the system that it will be built on is far from perfect, admit the core devs.  SSL's security speed bump  Certificates are difficult to do well. What happens if a certificate is fraudulent, as happened here, here, and here? What happens if a certificate has been revoked?  “In general, public key trust infrastructure is a very hard problem, and there is no silver bullet for it, unfortunately. The SSL PKI is sort of the worst existing system, after all others,” admits Wuille.  SSL is the colloquial name for X.509, the certificate standard that will be used for the Payment Request mechanism. Experts have long criticized it for its flaws. Dan Kaminsky and Moxie Marlinspike are demigods in the security business. They blew the lid off X.509 security vulnerabilities at the infamous Defcon hacker conference in 2009.  Other problems with X.509 include certificate revocation. Certificates can be revoked for a number of reasons, including certificate holders providing false documents, or doing other specious things online. X.509 uses a system called the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to see which certificates have been revoked.  “The consensus among experts is that the certificate revocation system (OCSP) doesn't work,” says lead developer Gavin Andresen. “There just aren't strong enough incentives for the certificate authorities to invest in the infrastructure to support millions of users constantly querying their OCSP servers and asking ‘Is this certificate revoked? No? How about now?’.”  Adoption vs security  So, at least two of the seven core developers admit that X.509 has cracks in it. Why are they using it? Like it or not, pretty much the entire Internet uses SSL, and in practice, the core devs don’t really have a choice in this. If you’re an online merchant, you probably have an SSL certificate. Even if the core dev team had the capacity to tackle the public key infrastructure problem and build a better mousetrap, they’d have to get people to use it. It’s enough of a struggle getting merchants interested in bitcoin in the first place, without making them register for another certificate all over again.  Nothing in tech is perfect, and as Andresen says, web-based merchants don’t rely on OCSP in practice either. X.509 is still more secure than the bitcoin addresses in use today. Any step forward is better than nothing.  The benefits of Payment Requests  A better payment mechanism would bring significant benefits to Bitcoin. The enhancements to the user experience shouldn’t be underestimated. One day, Andresen would like to see the bitcoin addresses currently used disappear forever. “Hopefully, eventually,” he says. “Bitcoin addresses are not very user-friendly.”  Bitcoin addresses won't be officially deprecated, says core developer Nils Schneider, but they might very well be used less when dealing with merchants, especially given that they currently have to generate separate bitcoin addresses for each transaction.  “As of now, using a different address for each transaction is the preferred way to keep transactions apart. This means creating and storing a private key for each transaction,” he explains. “With payment requests, you may use the same key multiple times and still be able to tell different transactions apart and know which customer sent the money.”  There is a lot of infrastructure already built on standard bitcoin addresses, says Wuille. That’s a lot of inertia to deal with. But he hopes that the superior customer experience will make it worthwhile. “Let's focus on trying to get e-business transactions to use it first, and we'll see about the rest.”  So, when is all of this likely to happen? The core devs aren’t committing to much. They’re shooting for payment requests in Bitcoin v0.9, but it’s not a dead cert, says Wuille. “We make releases whenever necessary. In case there's an important security update, there can be new releases of the 0.8.x series before 0.9,” he says. “The plan is to have payment protocol support in 0.9, but if this turns out to need significant and unexpected delays, perhaps 0.9 can be released without.”  Payment Requests may face its challenges, but it’s good for bitcoin, and it’s a bold move from a notoriously conservative development team. Anything that can make the process of sending the cryptocurrency between parties more securely and effectively will be a good thing.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/12/merchant-friendly-payments-less-than-perfect-but-better-than-before,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc2d1653407c5d06599fd2b8e598812941e7cb58-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
