42386350,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSh1B,1617397359,Decentralized DNS Project Handshake Patches Inflation Bug,"The team behind the decentralized Domain Name Server (DNS) project, Handshake, recently patched a bug that could have inflated the supply of HNS coins.      When it existed in Handshake’s code, the bug was never exploited and no user funds or domain data were compromised, Handshake’s developers wrote in a post.      “A flaw was discovered in the Handshake protocol that could unintentionally increase the total HNS coin supply beyond its designed limits,"" according to the post. ""A user with a reserved name claim could have accidentally generated small amounts of extra HNS by modifying their wallet. In the worst-case scenario, a malicious miner could generate nearly unlimited extra HNS in every block. The bug was never exploited and is now fixed.”      See also: Handshake Goes Live With an Uncensorable Internet Browser      The team advises miners and node operators to update to the newest version ASAP.      Handshake is a decentralized domain name service wherein users can purchase Handshake names, an alternative to the DNS identifiers traditionally used for accessing websites (Handshake users pay for these in HNS token). Per the blog post, the bug would have given users who have claimed Handshake names the ability to accidentally print extra HNS tokens.    Handshake inflation bug    Matthew Zipkin, former developer at BitGo and a contributor to Bcoin, alerted the team of the vulnerability on March 24. From here, Handshake developer (and Lightning Network architect) Joseph Poon and fellow Handshake dev Christopher Jeffrey coded fixes that were rolled out to HNS mining pools first.      The team approached miners like F2Pool and Poolin first because the bug required overhauling Handshake’s code, according to the post.      “This flaw is not just an implementation bug that could be fixed with a software patch. It is a problem with the design of the Handshake protocol and so it affects every user and all full nodes. The only way to fix this kind of issue is with a soft fork, which adds new rules to the protocol and is enforced by miners,"" the team said.      “Soft forks” are blockchain upgrades where new versions of a software are made compatible with older versions and, as the post admits, they typically occur with total community involvement. Handshake’s team executed this emergency soft fork because “the flaw could not be disclosed until the new protocol rules were in place and enforced by as much hashrate as possible,” the team said in the post.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/02/decentralized-dns-project-handshake-patches-inflation-bug,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00e1a555eb18fb1485b9a225560d79e36a771d46-1200x839.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Up 0.3% since 0:00 UTC. Flat over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $58,491-$60,102 (CoinDesk pricing)    Bitcoin was little changed after briefly pushing above $60,000 earlier Friday, but quickly found selling pressure that brought the largest cryptocurrency's price back down to about $58,900 as of press time.      ""This could be an interesting weekend for bitcoin as much of the institutional money is expected to be dormant,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange broker Oanda. ""Weekend volatility has been somewhat of a story this year, so many crypto watchers will look to see if any whales try to take advantage of illiquid conditions.""      Though bitcoin has roughly doubled in price this year, the gains have stalled around $60,000 despite continuing signs of growing mainstream adoption, including lofty price predictions from Wall Street firms including JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, and the brokerage firm BTIG.      JPMorgan issued a note Thursday arguing bitcoin could fetch a long-term price of $130,000 if its volatility continues to decline. According to the bank, bitcoin is becoming more appealing to institutions seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios, Business Insider reported Thursday.      BTIG issued a “buy” rating on shares of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm and bitcoin storehouse. The firm's analysts said their valuation was partly based on an assumption that BTC could rise to $95,000 by the end of 2022.      Bitcoin has been increasingly embraced by big investors as a potential hedge against inflation in the face of trillions of dollars of stimulus from governments and central banks around the world attempting to jolt their coronavirus-racked economies.      Greg Cipolaro, head of research for the digital-asset manager NYDIG, wrote Friday in a weekly newsletter that he sees bitcoin ""as an alternative to existing economic systems, which is why we think it has elicited so much interest, especially in the current easy money era.""

Ether’s 24-hour range: $1,950-$2,097 (CoinDesk pricing)    Ether jumped Friday to a new all-time high as the second-biggest cryptocurrency extended its winning streak to five days.      The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, ether traded as high as $2,097 around 20:41 UTC, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The price has rallied 24% this week in the wake of Visa's decision to facilitate crypto-based settlements on the Ethereum network.

The U.S. tech company purchased the Chinese miner for $9 million, according to a press release. Per the agreement, FutureFinTech will take full ownership of the firm’s mining operations, which includes some 30,000 ASICs located in China’s hydro-rich Sichuan region, but Nanjing Ribensi’s current staff will continue maintaining the farms.  Future FinTech CEO Shanchun Huang said the low cost of energy was a factor in the decision.      The farm “enables us to deploy advanced bitcoin mining machines, but to potentially generate profits due to the expected low energy cost of the target mining farm since it uses local low cost of hydroelectricity to run the mining machines,"" he said.      According to the statement, the sale comes with guaranteed profit targets between $2 million and $4 million up to 2023. If the farm fails to hit these numbers, then Nanjing Ribensi’s shareholders will make up the difference, the press release claims.

This week, the global payments giant announced it had begun letting users in the U.S. pay for things online with cryptocurrency. “We think it is a transitional point where cryptocurrencies move from being predominantly an asset class that you buy, hold and or sell to now becoming a legitimate funding source to make transactions in the real world at millions of merchants,” CEO Dan Schulman told Reuters.      Transitional is an apt word to describe the situation, especially for anyone using crypto with PayPal. Since last autumn, the company has been allowing customers to buy or sell bitcoin, ether and a few other coins, but not do much else with them – not even withdraw them from the platform, or deposit crypto they already owned.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Up to this point, the service was arguably just a way to gamble on the prices of these assets. Which, to be fair, is probably the most popular use case for crypto, at least among those people privileged enough not to need it to get transactions done.    You still can’t deposit or withdraw digital assets from PayPal, which undercuts the technology’s appeal as a way to put individuals back in control of their money in a world of unchecked asset seizures and involuntary bank bail-inshttps://money.cnn.com/2013/03/28/investing/bitcoin-cyprus/index.html. But now you can at least use the service to buy stuff.    How many users will take advantage of the new feature? Notwithstanding Crypto Twitter’s usual hyperventilating, a modicum of skepticism is warranted, given this technology’s long struggle to catch on as a payment mechanism.      And I say this having once believed (in the prehistoric days of 2013) that the payments use case would be a big part of bitcoin’s appeal.    The age of innocence    Even then, I had a tinge of doubt:      [The] 20-minute wait for Bitcoin confirmations is awkward for in-store retail purchases. Depending on the size of the purchase, a merchant who accepts Bitcoin may be taking a risk if he lets the customer walk out before the transaction is confirmed. But arguably he's already taking that risk if he accepts credit cards, since from a merchant's point of view the transaction isn't really done until the funds are placed in his account — which could be two or three days later in the card world.      In other ways, Bitcoin can be a compelling alternative (or supplement) to Visa, MasterCard or PayPal for merchants. ... For starters, there are no acceptance fees (Bitcoin has an optional transaction fee for senders, typically the equivalent of a few pennies, to expedite payments). And merchants who are put off by the notoriously volatile exchange rate between bitcoins on dollars don't have to take the currency risk. They can elect to hire a processor ... which will take immediate possession of the bitcoins on a merchant's behalf and remit the equivalent in dollars or euros. The fee for this service is around 1%, which still beats 2% to 3% for credit card payments. So merchants can reap the benefit of Bitcoin without having to worry about the price of bitcoin….      Ah, to be so young again! A few years later, during the bull market of 2017, network traffic became congested, “a few pennies” became a few dollars, settlement could take hours instead of minutes, and I ate my words.      Today, it’s another bull market, average confirmation times are again spiking, and fees are in the double digits in dollar terms. This latency has already scuppered at least one would-be Tesla buyer’s bitcoin payment:      Other blockchains’ developers tout their higher throughput and lower fees, but none of them boasts Bitcoin’s level of security, network effects or name recognition. Its closest competitor, Ethereum, faces its own scaling challenges.      On top of everything else, crypto prices remain volatile, and in the U.S. the government treats digital currencies as property, meaning buying a can of dog food with dogecoin is a reportable and taxable event.      None of this augurs well for crypto’s use in everyday commerce in the near term, at least from an Average Joe’s perspective.      If you don’t know how much a currency will be worth from one minute to the next and you might have to wait an hour and pay $20 to get the payment done and it’s going to generate a tax liability, why on Earth would you choose this method when buying diapers for your newborn at Walmart? Just swipe that credit card and get on with your life.    Winds of change?    Then again, I'm talking like a provincial American here. There is some evidence that crypto is starting to catch on as a means of exchange in other parts of the world where payment rails aren’t as developed.      Further, on-chain transfers aren’t the only way to move small amounts of digital money anymore; “second layer” systems like Bitcoin’s Lightning Network can do it fast and cheap like in the old days. One of the sector’s most promising entrepreneurs and the scion of a Bitcoin dynasty, Jack Mallers, is working with none other than Visa and using Lightning to clear dollar transactions.      And while the stoicism of “HODLing” bitcoin for the long term is admirable, there is a case that it must succeed as “electronic cash” (its creator’s words) if it is to succeed as “digital gold” (the current value proposition), at least as much as the reverse. As CoinDesk Research Director Noelle Acheson wrote a few weeks back:      It can be argued that bitcoin’s worth as a store of value depends on its utility. The more there is residual demand for bitcoin as a payment token, regardless of its price, the more investors will believe that demand for it will rise in a sustainable way.      It can also be argued it is essential for the health of the network that bitcoin’s use as a medium of exchange be encouraged. As successive halvings reduce the block subsidy (in which miners get new bitcoin as compensation for the work expended in successfully processing blocks of transactions), miner incentives will increasingly rely on transaction fees.      PayPal, to its credit, is greasing the wheels here. It won’t charge its usual fee to sell crypto when consumers use the Checkout with Crypto feature (and you have to sell it because PayPal isn’t asking its merchants to accept anything other than fiat). PayPal customers won’t have to worry about on-chain fees or confirmation times, either; that fussy business will be handled behind the scenes by the company and its partner Paxos. And PayPal will mitigate the tax preparation headache for U.S. customers by providing them with a form 1099 documenting their crypto sales and reporting the transactions to the Internal Revenue Service.      Will that be enough for consumers to overcome the indignity of paying taxes to buy a cup of coffee and the disincentive to spend a coin today that might be worth more tomorrow? Even with PayPal’s vast reach (29 million merchants worldwide), it’s a tall order.

42386358,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBShBF,1617387517,"‘Blockchain Recovery’ Scam Is Posing as a Legit Firm, UK FCA Warns","An audacious new scamming syndicate is targeting cryptocurrency investors by imitating a legitimate firm supervised by the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the regulator said.      The “clone” outfit has been emailing and cold-calling investors and impersonating Gain Capital UK Limited by attaching that (legit) company’s Firm Reference Number to a fake name, ""Blockchain Recovery Association,"" an FCA blog post states. (To be clear: Gain Capital UK Limited is a real company that is authorized by the FCA to carry out certain services.)      “Fraudsters are using the details of firms we authorize to try to convince people that they work for a genuine, authorized firm,” the FCA said.      “Almost all firms and individuals carrying out financial services activities in the U.K. have to be authorized or registered by us. [The Blockchain Recovery Association] is not authorized or registered by us but has been targeting people in the U.K., claiming to be an authorized firm.”      The fake firm has listed its address and phone number as: Cambridge Court 210, Shepherds Bush Rd, Hammersmith, London; +44 555-183-726. CoinDesk called this number and received a “This call cannot be completed as dialed” message (555 numbers, traditionally used for directory assistance, often indicate fake numbers).      Impersonating legitimate organizations is a longstanding and, unfortunately, often effective practice among scammers. In the U.S., for example, mortgage fraudsters have posed as government housing officials from the Great Depression well into the 21st century. Email phishing scams can be thought of as a low-effort digital version of the same ruse.      While the FCA post does not explicitly state the nature of the cloned firm’s chicanery, the fraud appears to be an attempt to trick crypto users into exposing the private keys to their holdings or other personal information.    'Tis the season    The scam identified by FCA is perhaps a reminder that, as crypto becomes more institutionalized, scammers will find newer (and bolder) ways still to filch what they can from this trillion-dollar asset class.      Traditionally, an easy attack vector for hackers and like have been phishing attacks. With these attacks, malicious actors trick crypto users into entering sensitive information, like a password or private key, on a website or through a messaging medium to gain access to accounts or coins.      Alternatively, these actors may use personal contact information like email addresses, phone numbers and home addresses to extort and threaten victims.      In the past, data leaks from hardware wallet Ledger and crypto lender BlockFi, among others, have led to phishing or extortion attempts. As bitcoin and other coins rise in price, scams and fraud are matching the market demand, with fake wallets even making their way on popular app stores.

42386357,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSh9z,1617375991,FinCEN Names Former Chainalysis Advisor Acting Director as Blanco Resigns,"The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) just hired Chainalysis’ former chief technical counsel as its new acting director, a hire that reflects the federal government’s increased interest in the growing cryptocurrency sector.      Michael Mosier will assume the post on April 11 following the departure of current Director Kenneth A. Blanco, who announced his resignation.      Blanco's tenure at FinCEN was marked by his stance that the burgeoning crypto industry is subject to existing regulations and as such does not require its own legal framework.      Most recently, Mosier served as counselor to the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, a job he took on last month after having served as FinCEN’s deputy director and first Digital Innovation Officer.      Joining Mosier is AnnaLou Tirol, the former associate director of FinCEN’s Strategic Operations Division, who will now serve as FinCEN's deputy director.      Before his stint as a deputy secretary and his new job at FinCEN, Mosier was the chief technical counsel at blockchain surveillance firm Chainalysis. Mosier held the position from June 2019 until February 2020 when he joined FinCEN. FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Treasury, serves as the U.S. financial intelligence unit.      Established in 2014, Chainalysis uses public blockchain data to trace and reveal details of cryptocurrency transactions for law enforcement agencies, private companies and government agencies. The company’s software has been used by public and private entities to trace exchange hacks and pinpoint illicit transactions. With the new bull market in cryptocurrencies, Chainalysis and its products have found favor with U.S. federal and state agencies.      Updated Thursday, May 6, 2021, 21:45 UTC: A previous version of this article stated that Mosier was the former CTO of Chainalysis; this is incorrect, and the article has been updated to reflect that he served as chief technical counsel to the surveillance company.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/02/fincen-names-former-chainalysis-advisor-acting-director-as-blanco-resigns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2ec6b8ad153e5737fa99ad222eb6231ab805c64-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""The 90-day correlations between BTC and both gold and stocks (represented by the S&P 500) reverted to a more typical range of 0.0-0.2 during Q1, most likely as a result of the growing clarity around its value proposition relative to more traditional assets,"" CoinDesk's research analysts noted in their first-quarter review.      In simple words, analysts mean the accumulation of bitcoin during the first quarter by major public-listed firms such as Tesla, the electric vehicle maker led by billionaire Elon Musk, validated the long-held belief in digital-asset markets that the cryptocurrency could serve as a reserve asset or a digital alternative to gold.      That likely offered investors clarity on bitcoin's use case or value proposition relative to traditional markets and weakened the cryptocurrency's mild positive correlation with stocks and gold.      The correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 was higher for most of 2020 – a sign that many investors viewed the cryptocurrency as just another risky asset class like stocks. Back then, gold, a proven haven asset, also moved in line with equities.      While the cryptocurrency is no longer tracking stocks and gold so closely, its inverse correlation with the U.S. dollar remains intact, meaning a continued rally in the greenback (versus foreign-exchange counterparts like the euro, yen and British pound) may slow down bitcoin's rally.

Thailand’s central bank assistant governor announced Friday it is open to accepting public feedback on its retail CBDCs by June 15.  BoT said the main objective of the currency is to provide citizens with access to more convenient and secure financial services.  The bank is planning to fully implement the currency over the next three to five years, according to a Reuters report.  The CBDCs will be aimed at providing access to convenient and secure financial services and “it will not affect the Thai financial system,” Vachira Arromdee, the assistant governor of the financial markets operations group, Bank of Thailand, said at a briefing, according to Reuters.  In March, BoT said it will issue regulations on asset-backed stablecoins later this year after warning against the illegal use of a baht-denominated stablecoin that was created outside the country.

The unemployment rate edged down to 6% from 6.2%.      The gains were led by leisure and hospitality, public and private education, and construction.      The coronavirus pandemic-hit leisure and hospitality sector added a whopping 280,000 jobs.      With increased vaccination rates, macroeconomic uncertainty for the U.S. labor market is decreasing. While institutions have been providing the largest inflows to high-yield assets like bitcoin recently, the decrease in uncertainty could bode well for retail investors in digital assets.      While many investors treat bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and in some cases a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty, a recent survey of European households by an economics professor at the University of Texas, Olivier Coibion, and four other economists showed that households reduced their share of assets allocated to crypto by 0.5 percentage points during times of elevated macroeconomic uncertainty.      One notable difference between economic recovery in a pandemic-induced recession and recovery in previous recessions is the large fraction of unemployment caused by temporary layoffs, said Robert Hall, an economics professor at Stanford University.      “In the previous recessions, the unemployed on temporary layoffs were a tiny fraction of all the unemployed,” Hall said. “The distinction is important because the unemployed on temporary layoffs typically have a much higher rate of returning to employment than the other unemployed.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/02/us-added-more-than-900k-jobs-in-march-blowing-past-estimates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/727126cd9e9fac2ff5758fea3df3cf558f580ee3-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the report doesn't mention bitcoin (BTC), the analysis shows how countries' adoption of CBDCs might indirectly create extra demand for the largest cryptocurrency as an investment hedge against inflation.      The Bank of America report, titled ""Digital Love: Central Bank Digital Currencies,” explained the benefits of CBDCs, including their potential to increase the speed of domestic and international payment systems, while lowering costs.      Those advantages could make it easier for governments and central banks to distribute stimulus money, according to the report.    ""CBDCs represent the next frontier for central bank stimulus, potentially acting as a potent conduit for policies such as stimulus checks, emergency lending programs, UBI (universal basic income), inducing a more powerful, directed 'money drop.' The evolution of central bank digital currencies is likely to increase inflation expectations, boosting the case for inflation assets in the 2020s.""  Disruption from cryptocurrencies ""is prodding central banks to secure their role as the dominant means for settlement of payments, and their ability to supervise banks and conduct monetary policy,” wrote Bank of America.  Digital currencies issued by central banks could provide disadvantaged populations with greater access to financial services without bank intermediation, according to the report.  ""CBDCs could also speed the delivery of directed stimulus or helicopter drops. For example, many of the [Federal Reserve's] recent pandemic credit programs were hampered by legal and logistical issues,"" including the Main Street Lending Program, which has extended only $31 billion of its $600 billion authorization.  ""The existence of a CBDC would likely have allowed simpler designs and facilitated the targeted extension of credit. In cooperation with fiscal authorities, stimulus could be surgically tailored. In contrast to broad fiscal measures like the recent $1,400 stimulus checks issued by the U.S. Treasury, governments could credit smaller amounts to specific populations or industries to achieve their policy aims.""  However, the report also lists potential drawbacks. Governments could obtain access to private individual spending data.  There's also a crowding-out effect: “CBDCs could compete with banks and money funds by providing another option to store value, curtailing cheap deposit funding for banks and reducing margins on money funds.”  Bank of America expects the evolution of CBDCs to increase inflation expectations, boosting the case for inflation assets over the next few years.

BTIG, which also praised MicroStrategy's core business, said that it views bitcoin as a form of digital gold and that buying MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) provides investors a way to gain exposure to the virtual currency.  MicroStrategy's strategy lets it benefit from the rise of bitcoin driven by its adoption by institutional investors worried about inflation.  BTIG said its valuation is partly based on an assumption that the price of bitcoin will rise to $95,000 by the end of 2022 and on MicroStrategy's shift from a product license model to a cloud-first, subscription one.  MicroStrategy has reported owning 91,326 bitcoin it bought for $2.21 billion, BTIG noted, with that stash worth now more than $5 billion. Given that MicroStrategy shares are just over half where they had reached in early February, BTIG says the current price is an attractive entry point.  BTIG said it has an $850 per share price target on MicroStrategy's shares. No time frame was provided.  Shares of MicroStrategy closed Wednesday at $703.56, up $24.76 or 3.65%.

According to JPMorgan, bitcoin is becoming more appealing to institutions seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios, Business Insider reported Thursday.  The U.S. investment bank noted that high volatility “acts as a headwind towards further institutional adoption.”  The signs that bitcoin’s volatility is diminishing could see it “crowding out gold” as a portfolio diversifier and suggests a long-term price target of $130,000, JPMorgan’s note said.  This target is based on the notion that bitcoin’s volatility will meet gold’s, which for the time being is still some way off. Bitcoin’s realized volatility in the last three months stood at 86% compared to 16% for gold.  A separate JPMorgan report issued to ultra-high-net-worth clients in March played down the comparison between bitcoin and gold, arguing that the crypto’s “volatility characteristics and correlation profile refute the comparison to the traditional safe-haven asset.”    See also: Veteran Analyst Peter Brandt Expects Bitcoin to Reach $200K",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/02/bitcoins-drop-in-volatility-may-boost-appeal-make-130k-possible-jpmorgan-says-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4939b92e52d91d376bbbec7edaf4bb734b1559a8-1500x988.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386354,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSh6D,1617328925,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High as Delayed ASIC Shipments Come Online,"Bitcoin’s mining difficulty hit an all-time high today after a roughly 6% increase, a move that follows a record month in earnings for bitcoin miners as new-generation ASICs come online.      “Difficulty” refers to the relative measure of the amount of resources required to mine bitcoin. This measurement climbs or falls depending on the amount of power consumed (or “hashrate” produced) by the network at a given time. Bitcoin is programmed to adjust its difficulty level every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks, to ensure that new blocks are mined at a stable rate.    Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works                This difficulty is measured on a relative scoring scale where bitcoin launched with a mining difficulty of “1,” the lowest it has ever been. (Difficulty works like Google Search scores in that the scoring system is internal and has no reference point or unit for measurement outside of the networks themselves.)      As of today’s adjustment, bitcoin's current mining difficulty is 23.1 trillion, according to data pulled from this CoinDesk journalist's Bitcoin node. Per figures from BTC.com, that is a roughly 6% increase from its last level of 21.8 trillion, which makes it the second-largest adjustment of the year and the fifth upward adjustment in the last six difficulty periods.      The difficulty adjustment is arguably one of Bitcoin’s most important features as it ensures block times remain relatively stable while also preventing a large miner from eating up too much hashrate.    New ASICs online lead to increased difficulty, hashrate    This latest adjustment is a notable bump, Compass Mining CEO Whit Gibbs told CoinDesk, because it’s likely attributable to tens of thousands of new machines coming online that were previously on back order in the ASIC supply chain. ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits, are chips that are customized for a specific use.      Gibbs said the current adjustment is just a sampler of the flood of hashrate that will come online in 2022 as more back-ordered shipments are filled.      ""Today’s moderately large difficulty increase is not surprising, and I expect it's only a taste of what will come later in this year and into 2022, as delayed machine shipments start arriving and being deployed. The pending flood of hashrate about to enter the market will only continue pushing bitcoin’s mining difficulty higher, which should track with bitcoin's price,” Gibbs said.      As bitcoin’s price has gone stratospheric, mining investments have been soaring. North American miners such as Hut 8, Marathon, Blockcap and others have used 2021 as an opportunity to aggressively expand operational capacity. As these machines come online, bitcoin’s hashrate and difficulty are rising in step with miner revenues, which hit a record $1.5 billion in March.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/02/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-hits-all-time-high-as-delayed-asic-shipments-come-online,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/397003c5e71ed80bb84567093c136e19e7678bc9-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
