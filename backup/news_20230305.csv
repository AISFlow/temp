42435415,yQOv5bn58BVfxFU7cHP3BQ,1678059872,ETHDenver Teases Spin-off Plans as Conference Winds Down,"DENVER – The biggest ETHDenver ever closed out on Sunday, with finalists in the Ethereum ecosystem conference’s hackathon presenting their builds to a ragged but still energized crowd at Denver’s National Western Complex.  After two weeks of programming, hacker houses, parties and panels that spanned the city of Denver, thousands of attendees had whittled down to a couple hundred diehard developers at ETHDenver’s main stage for closing ceremonies.  The collectivist nature of the festival – a celebration of the Ethereum ecosystem and also a summit for developers building atop it – bled into conference co-founder John Paller’s closing remarks.  This year’s ETHDenver mascot was a spork – the multi-purpose dining utensil that organizers used as a metaphor for the conference's utility-minded goals. In his remarks on Sunday, Paller revealed the mascot for next year’s gathering would be the ""SporkWhale,"" which he said embodies community ownership.  ETHDenver, a community-run conference managed by token-holder members in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), reached new heights this year; on the first day of the main event, a staffer said there were over 16,000 tickets to be checked in – a sellout. The event had 600 staffers, Paller said.  The conference is poised to grow in size and scope next year, Paller said. He said organizers are in discussion with “countries” over setting up satellite feeder events around the world to which ETHDenver would be the “Super Bowl.”",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/05/ethdenver-teases-spin-off-plans-as-conference-winds-down,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3af94df31f0653daab8d4bf0f09a50505e7494d-4403x2477.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The roughly 66% drop in banks' crypto custody over the past year coincided with a market crash stemming from a slew of high-profile failures, ranging from the collapse of the Terra blockchain ( LUNC-USD ) ( UST-USD ) in May to crypto exchange FTX’s ( FTT-USD ) implosion in November. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the largest token by market cap, sank about 65% during the year, marking the worst Y/Y slump since plunging ~75% in 2018. In addition, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the primary global standard setter for banking rules, approved new regulations late last year whereby a bank’s exposure to a certain crypto must be capped at 2%. The BIS cited this move as another reason for the drop in depository institutions’ crypto custody, although the proposed rules won't take effect until the beginning of 2025. When taking account of the participating banks in addition to those that did not report crypto custody exposures (but joined the wider Basel III monitoring exercise), total exposure was 0.001% versus 0.005% for only those that reported. Clearly banks have marginal exposure to crypto, which makes sense as many regulators raised their concerns about financial stability risks surrounding crypto banking. Still, banks' total prudential crypto exposures, including synthetic or derivative exposures, climbed 30% Y/Y to EUR 2.9B, given ""increased underlying cryptoasset activity,"" the study found. The underlying assets of the reported crypto exposures were primarily bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), 43%, Coinbase ( NASDAQ: COIN ) stock, 29%, and ethereum ( ETH-USD ), 4%. Silvergate Capital ( NYSE: SI ) took the spotlight in recent days as the crypto-friendly bank faces an exodus of institutional clients, including Coinbase Global ( COIN ) and Galaxy Digital ( OTCPK:BRPHF ), after noting it will delay filing its annual report and revealing doubts about its viability. The latest blow to the industry was reflected in the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), sliding 4.7% to $22.36K as of Friday afternoon. Amid the prolonged market turmoil, Signature Bank ( NASDAQ: SBNY ) has been working to limit its digital currency deposit exposure to less than 20% of total deposits. In its recently issued mid-Q1 financial update, the lender said its spot deposit balances dipped by around $826M due to notable crypto deposit outflows of $1.51B. Other banks that have made their foray into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space include: Goldman Sachs ( NYSE: GS ), SVB Financial ( NASDAQ: SIVB ), Customers Bancorp ( NYSE: CUBI ), Metropolitan Bank ( NYSE: MCB ), Bank of New York Mellon ( NYSE: BK ), BNP Paribas ( OTCQX:BNPQF ) ( OTCQX:BNPQY ) and Leumi ( OTCPK:BLMIF ).

42435417,yQOv5bn58BVfxFU7cHP3Fw,1677978200,Lido’s LDO Token Sinks 10% Following Rumors Crypto Staking Service Received SEC Notice,"Lido’s LDO token tanked 10% on Saturday following a rumor the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) served the largest Ethereum staking service with a Wells Notice.  A Lido spokesperson declined to comment on whether the protocol had received a notice.  A Wells Notice is a letter from the SEC detailing charges it is considering bringing against a recipient. On Friday, David Hoffman of the ""Bankless"" crypto podcast said that he’d heard Lido and other crypto projects had been served with Wells Notices, an assertion he later retracted.  Hoffman described his comments to CoinDesk as ""a miscommunication between me and a lawyer friend.""  The rumor sparked panic on Crypto Twitter, however, and it quickly spread across the Colorado convention hall where ETHDenver, one of the year’s largest crypto industry gatherings, was underway. The rumors, if proven true, would suggest that the SEC is ramping up scrutiny of Ethereum and crypto staking.  Wells Notice rumors  On Friday, Hoffman said on a video stream that “many Wells Notices” had been distributed in the past week, adding, “I think Lido got one.” Soon after the video spread on Twitter, Hoffman backtracked. “While there is at least one confirmed Wells Notice that *has* gone out recently, that *isn't* known to the public, the idea of a mass recent carpet bomb isn't correct,” he tweeted.  “There have apparently been rumors of Lido being caught in the crosshairs of Gary the Destroyer,” he said, referencing SEC Commissioner Gary Gensler, who has become persona non grata in some cryptocurrency circles due to the perception that he is unfriendly to the industry. “Members of the Lido team have reached out to me and said that this is false.”  It is unclear how the SEC would have delivered notice to Lido. The staking service is technically operated by the Lido decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning it is governed by a vast network of Lido’s LDO token holders and lacks a formal leadership structure.  Despite Hoffman’s retraction, the market appeared to respond to his Wells remarks; the price of LDO has fallen 10% in the past 24 hours.  Andrew Thurman of crypto analytics firm Nansen tweeted that Wintermute, one of the largest crypto market makers, sold off around 10%, or $2 million, of its LDO holdings. Thurman speculated the sell-off was correlated with the Wells rumor, but Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy told CoinDesk that the timing was ""coincidental.""  The SEC’s crypto crackdown  Friday’s Wells Notice fracas comes amid a broader crypto industry crackdown by U.S. securities regulators. Last month, for instance, stablecoin issuer Paxos confirmed that it had been served with a Wells Notice on Feb. 3. The SEC said it is considering charging Paxos with operating an unregistered security with its Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin.  Lido, a liquid staking platform, helps users lock up – or “stake” – tokens to earn interest and help secure the Ethereum blockchain. Lido currently accounts for 31% of all staked ether (ETH), according to Dune Analytics. The $8 billion staked with Ethereum via Lido, a decentralized service, makes it the largest Ethereum staker.  Last month, the crypto exchange platform Kraken agreed to shutter its own staking service in the U.S. in a settlement with the SEC. The Kraken shutdown had a chilling effect on the crypto staking landscape, raising regulatory questions for similar services – centrally controlled and DAO operated alike.
