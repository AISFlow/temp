In a post on Twitter, Foxx promoted the token sale for Cobinhood, which is being advertised as a zero-fee cryptocurrency exchange. That sale is currently underway, according to its website, netting about 17,840 ethers (worth roughly $5.1 million at press time) to date.    Looking forward to participating in the new @cobinhood Token!

42427786,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3oHh,1505761282,Survey: Younger Americans More Likely to Invest in Bitcoin,"New survey data from online student loan marketplace LendEDU suggests that younger consumers in the United States are more interested in investing in bitcoin.  The startup published the results of its survey today, which was conducted online in August and drew 1,000 participants from around the US. The survey focused on a number of areas, including a basic question about whether they've heard of bitcoin at all. As it turns out, roughly 78% of respondents said they had.  Among the notable findings in the LendEDU survey is that, according to the data, younger consumers – those between the ages of 18 and 34, showed more willingness to invest in bitcoin than older age groups.  Of those between the ages of 18 and 24, 35.9% said they plan on investing in bitcoin, versus 43.5% who said no and 20.5% who weren't sure. For the 25-34 age group, the ""yes"" figure grew to 40.4%, with 31.7% of respondents in that demographic saying no.  By comparison, just over 10% of those between the ages of 45 and 54 indicated an interest in investing in bitcoin. Less than 5% of those over the age of 55 expressed the same sentiment, the survey data shows.  In a blog post detailing the results, LendEDU predicted that this data foreshadows a greater role for bitcoin among younger consumers.  ""Judging from this data, as the years go by and younger Americans develop more spending power, you can expect bitcoin to become more and more prevalent in the American economy,"" the company said.

According to a newly published notice, the meeting – set for October 12 – will feature ""a discussion regarding blockchain and other distributed ledger technology and implications for securities markets"". No other details, including the speakers that may attend or the specific issues that may be raised, are known at this time.  The gathering represents the latest public hearing hosted by a part of the US government that is dedicated, at least in part, to blockchain. The US Treasury Department hosted an event in January, focused on the ramifications of blockchain for the insurance market. Other agencies, including the CFTC, have held their own hearings on the topic as well.  What remains to be seen is whether any of the recent SEC actions will be raised during the meeting. For example, at the end of July, the agency released the findings of its investigation into The DAO, the ethereum-based funding vehicle that collapsed last year, as well as its broader determination that some tokens sold via initial coin offering (ICO) constitute securities.  As with past public hearings, the SEC will be live-streaming the event on its website for those unable to attend.

42400432,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYdL,1505752221,Bitcoin 'Double Taxation' Relief Bill Introduced in Australia,"Australia's government has introduced a bill that delivers on a long-standing promise to solve a ""double taxation"" problem for cryptocurrencies.  As it stands today, Australians are potentially liable for goods-and-services tax (GST) when they either purchase or spend a cryptocurrency. This state of affairs has been the target of criticism from the country's local bitcoin community, and in March 2016, the government announced a plan to resolve the issue by removing the tax at the time of purchase.  Now, months after unveiling a budget that included the tax cut, Australia's government has introduced legislation that would, if passed, codify the elimination. In a September 14 statement, the Australian Treasury said that the plan would ""cement Australia’s reputation as a global fintech centre.""  The government explained:  ""The Bill will ensure that Australians are no longer charged GST on purchases of digital currency, allowing it to be treated the same way as physical money for GST purposes. The law change will retrospectively apply from 1 July 2017, in line with the 2017 Budget announcement.""  The measure was framed as part of a wider effort to promote financial technologies in Australia, including its homegrown cryptocurrency ecosystem.  ""The Bill will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia, as the government takes action to boost jobs and wages.""  It's not immediately clear when the bill will be brought up for debate and potential revision. Australia has a bicameral legislature, meaning that both chambers would need to approve the legislation before it could advance and become national law.

In a new interview with CNBC, MUFG CEO Nobuyuki Hirano responded to questioning about the JPMorgan chief executive's remarks, which made headlines after he branded bitcoin ""a fraud"" and saying that ""it won't end well."" Notably, Hirano stressed in the interview that ""there are different types of digital currencies,"" including one that forms part of a blockchain-based settlement system that MUFG and other financial institutions are developing.  ""In short the digital currency probably Jamie blamed as fraud is public digital currency,"" he told the outlet.  Hirano went on to emphasize that, unlike public cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, private digital currencies are regulated and controlled, arguing:  ""...it's a kind of interbank money or securities settlement clearing method. So it has nothing to do with bitcoin or other type or that there's that currencies which does not have any controlling arm, which has a huge volatility every day and which is not really with the money laundering and other problems.""  The MUFG CEO concluded that, by applying blockchain to the payments and settlement process, the bank hopes ""to make every operation more efficient.""  The institution has been working on digital currency concepts for some time, including an internal ""MUFG coin"" which sought to replicate aspects of other digital currencies but without bitcoin's energy-intensive mining process.

42400428,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYYQ,1505743229,'End of Life Cycle': BIS Report Positions DLT as Needed Banking Update,"The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has published a report arguing that distributed ledger technology (DLT) could help central banks replace their aging payment systems.  BIS, which is effectively a bank for central banks, commissioned the report to look at both DLT and cryptocurrencies with the aim of clarifying their applicability in a central banking context.  While central bank-issued cryptocurrencies are still largely speculative, it concludes, DLT has shown their potential utility in the industry. Such a digital currency would be of particular utility in countries such as Sweden which are seeing a reduction in the use of cash, the paper states.  Most notable in the paper's findings, though, is that DLT is of particular interest to central banks due to a need to upgrade existing payment systems.  The paper states:  ""One of the reasons for the interest in DLT is that many central bank-operated wholesale payment systems are at the end of their technological life cycles. The systems are programmed in obsolete languages or use database designs that are no longer fit for purpose and are costly to maintain.""  The paper comes amid growing interest in DLT and cryptocurrencies worldwide, with various central banks experimenting with applications of the tech. Bank of Canada, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Bank of England and the Central Bank of Brazil are all attempting to implement real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems onto DLT platforms, while others have expressed interest.  Further, several central banking authorities have already moved to experiment with cryptocurrencies. Last week, The Reserve Bank of India hinted that it was researching what it called a ""fiat cryptocurrency"" as a digital alternative to the rupee. Officials in Russia have also expressed support for a national cryptocurrency  The BIS paper states, however, that while interest exists in central bank-issued cryptocurrencies, there is confusion in institutions surrounding what they actually are. As such, its authors provide a taxonomy of terms to clarify the potential of cryptocurrencies.

42400439,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYlD,1505739604,Inside the Blockchain Factory: How IBM's Distributed Ledger Work Went Global,"For one of the world's largest tech companies, ""small"" is a relative term.  So when IBM, a tech conglomerate that boasts 380,000 employees, says it has a ""small"" team working on blockchain, by startup standards, it's anything but. Far from just building a garage and staffing it with a few engineers, IBM has created a network of global offices seeking to operationalize its team of 1,500 blockchain professionals now operating out of a dozen offices.  Perhaps more impressively, all those moving parts are choreographed by one person: Marie Wieck, a 20-year veteran of IBM and the general manager of the newly created blockchain unit.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Wieck explained what it takes to build distributed networks using both its proprietary IBM Blockchain Platform and the open-source Hyperledger Fabric, which her firm helped pioneer. For companies looking to gain access to one of those networks, build their own network or compete against IBM, the step-by-step description provides a rare glimpse into how the $135 billion company conducts its blockchain business.  Speaking from her office at IBM’s Watson headquarters in downtown Manhattan (one half of what is internally referred to as ""Blockchain North""), Wieck painted a picture of a distributed team that in many ways mirrors a blockchain in its design.  She told CoinDesk:  ""We're trying to keep as co-located as possible with the teams working together so we can really focus on the speed to market that we want to see.""  Blockchain North  While her job now is buzzing back and forth between the Manhattan location and the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York (the other half of Blockchain North), Wieck first started working with IBM back in 1997 when she joined as a founding member of the company's nascent internet unit.  As part of this team, she began a career of finding business use cases for cutting-edge technology that would eventually include XML, web services and mobile, preparing her in many ways for her current task of helping IBM's clients with blockchain.  The ""solution work"" of this process – as Wieck calls it – is centered around Blockchain North, the assembly line mechanism of the project, where staff help clients around the world build applications using the IBM Blockchain Platform.  Due in large part to the open-source code at the core of IBM's blockchain strategy, one which lets clients build on their own distributed ledgers as well, Wieck frequently doesn’t get involved until the clients – or potential clients – are already well advanced in their work.  As for work on that open-source platform, and the IBM Blockchain Platform itself, that largely takes place 511 miles south.  Blockchain South  Known as ""Blockchain South,"" the Research Triangle Park offices in Raleigh, North Carolina, are home to what Wieck calls IBM's ""platform work.""  This is where the IBM Blockchain Platform – unveiled for enterprises last month – has been developed for the past three years. The platform is designed to be an end-to-end or ""full-cycle"" solution where developers and managers can experiment with the technology, building it and testing it either by the hour or via subscriptions.  This platform is the machinery that in part cranks out the solutions in Blockchain North. But ""platform work"" also has another meaning at Blockchain South.  For builders around the world with a more adventurous bent, this is also where they can go to hire help on projects that bypass IBM's proprietary platform and go straight to its open-source core: Hyperledger Fabric.  While Fabric comprises about one-third the total code used in the proprietary IBM Blockchain Platform, anyone can build on it – even if what they want to create is a direct competitor to IBM.  ""Whatever they need to do at the technical level to operate or to build a blockchain network, we would like to see continuing to expand in that platform,"" said Wieck.  Littleton, Massachusetts  IBM's newest blockchain offices are located at the IBM Mass Lab in Littleton, Massachusetts.  Originally opened in January 2010 as what was then touted by IBM as the largest software development lab in North America, the location now serves as a satellite location of sorts for Blockchain North.  But instead of being focused on solutions work generally, the location is helping develop what Wieck calls ""solution accelerators,"" or frequently used widgets such as the provenance engine required by many of IBM's clients to track items.  Crucially, however, this is also the base operations for another kind of solution: governance.  Based on the lessons learned from other implementations, IBM uses the Littleton branch to help companies write software to onboard new members, develop consensus mechanisms so they can find ways to agree, and if things go wrong, kick bad actors off the network.  Or as Wieck put it:  ""How to actually operate a network at scale.""  In the garage  Arguably the most startup-like component of IBM's blockchain work, Wieck also oversees nine ""Bluemix Garages"" scattered around the world, in New York City, Toronto, San Francisco, London, Nice, Tokyo, Singapore, Austin and Melbourne.  Initially launched in 2014, the collaborative locations are similar to WeWork facilities, but with startups hand-selected to receive support from IBM.  Gradually, those locations are being adapted to accommodate increasing demand by blockchain companies. Most recently, this July, the BlueMix Garage in the Soho area of New York (pictured above) expanded to include support for blockchain services.  At these disparate locations, and in any real garages where people build on the open-source technology Wieck helped develop, she said the basic principles that form IBM's blockchain networks first take root.  ""To me, it's kind of like a mall,"" she said, concluding:  ""You may have the anchor tenants, but you don't stay in a mall unless the food court is good, there's good movies playing. You want all of those value-added services around that network.""

42400437,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYiG,1505736318,"Bitcoin's Price Is Back Above $4,000, But Is All-Time High in Sight?","It's safe to say Friday wasn't the most stable day for the (BTC/USD) exchange rate.  After news of exchange shake-ups in China triggered a wave of panic selling, prices fell below $3,000 for the first time in months. Overall, this was the lowest total observed on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index since August 5, when a V-shape recovery saw prices rise all the way to $3,875.  Yet, just a few days later, the price is already back at that level, having gained 33% in three days.  The sharp recovery could be attributed to oversold technical conditions and to the relief offered by news that China’s exchange ban would not impact all forms of cryptocurrency trading.  But while the exact causes are uncertain, it seems safe to say the bad news has already been priced in by the market.  The recovery from the low of $2,980 followed by a bout of consolidation (ongoing) in the range of $3,500 to $3,800 over the weekend and move above the resistance of $3,900 (September 5 low) today further indicates there's confidence in the current market state.  So, is bitcoin out of the woods?  Price action analysis says bitcoin could be setting up for a solid rally to record highs, the likes of which it saw from mid-July. However, the bulls still need to clear some key technical resistance levels, before claiming victory over the bears.  Daily chart - 100-day moving average support & an oversold RSI  The price action witnessed over the last 48 hours is similar to conditions seen in mid-July, i.e. the dip below the 100-day moving average was short lived as the RSI (relative strengh index) was oversold.  At that time, the market saw a huge breakout, followed by a rally to record high of $5,000.  Still, the daily chart shows back-to-back Doji candles (on Saturday & Sunday), a candlestick pattern which shows indecision in the marketplace. A bullish reversal is confirmed if the Doji is followed by a positive candle. If bitcoin ends on a positive note today, preferably above $3,958 (50-day moving average), a bullish reversal would be confirmed.  If bitcoin ends on a positive note today, preferably above $3,958 (50-day moving average), a bullish reversal would be confirmed.  Outlook  The trend line drawn from September 2 high and September 8 high will offer resistance around $4,250 levels. A break higher would open doors for fresh record highs in bitcoin.  View  A bullish reversal confirmation followed by a break above $4,250 would add credence to the rebound from the 100-DMA and shall boost the odds of the digital currency rallying to fresh record highs above $5,000.  Only a daily close below $3,600 would revive the bearish view.

42400429,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYbN,1505734321,Japan Exchange Report: Cloud Edging Out DLT for Capital Markets Needs,"The Japan Exchange Group (JPX) has released a new working paper on the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in capital markets, one that seeks to build on its past reports and proofs-of-concept.  In a paper, released Thursday, JPX analyzes how different types of distributed ledgers – including Hyperledger Fabric, R3's Corda and JPMorgan's Quorum platform – can be utilized to help companies become more efficient when conducting transactions, with much of the work revolving around the viability of the emerging technology for financial services.  However, the report notably goes on to detail possible stress points in the adoption of DLT.  These include difficulties when trying to use advanced cryptography for the confidential transfer of assets, performance issues with certain transactions and possible centralization risks that could result from a consolidation of blockchain nodes in the cloud.  Still, JPX's researchers go so far as to suggest that financial institutions should perhaps seek capital markets solutions with existing cloud solutions in the short term. The authors, in particular, cite the effort by Swift to move cross-border payments to the cloud through its Global Payment Innovation (GPI) project as one likely to be more successful.  Despite these potential issues, however, the authors conclude that more experimentation on DLT is needed to realize its potential benefits.  According to the report:  ""It is a highly meaningful process for users of new technologies to proactively study a new technology and provide feedback to developers based on practical needs. We believe that steadily evolving financial services by implementing new technologies for production use in this industry is essential, even if the new technologies are not very different from existing technologies.""  As such, the report positions JPX as perhaps one of the rare large financials interested in publishing unbiased research on permissioned blockchains, a field of study that even the authors note has seen fading interest due to the recent spike in the value of public cryptocurrencies.  The JPX has already been driving blockchain development, launching a consortium last March to test applications and determine how such a platform could operate with real-world applications.

42400426,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYaO,1505728812,Split on Forks? Blockchain Leaders Learn Tough Lessons from Bitcoin Scaling,"Cypherpunks attack ideas, not people – or so the saying goes.  If bitcoin's long-roiling scaling debate is any indication, though, that doesn't always work in practice. From suggestions that some were undermining the project's intent to outright personal attacks, things have gotten – and remain – heated.  But with at least the first chapter in bitcoin's scaling debate in the books (and maybe more to come), the lead developers of other blockchain protocols are taking note, hoping to draw lessons to create a smoother environment for upgrading the new form of software.  First and foremost for many, though, is determining whether bitcoin truly reached a ""consensus"" of stakeholders, and just how the network – by far the largest blockchain in terms of the number and diversity of users, startups, developers and miners – achieved the upgrade (conclusions vary).  All in all, the mix of competing proposals may have resulted in the feeling that open-source economics is becoming more of a republic than a direct democracy.  In fact, Riccardo Spagni, a monero core developer, went so far as to label the latter idea a fallacy, saying:  ""When it comes to measuring consensus we have to view the opinion of people contributing a bunch of code worth more than the people on the sidelines just writing posts on reddit and tweeting a lot.""  Actual consensus  That's not to say that any user should be left in the dark when a protocol is making changes, it's just that deciding who to listen to is easier said than done.  ""We need to have discussions, not just as a group of developers, but actually discussing it with users, miners and economically-sensitive nodes like exchanges and merchants,"" Spagni told CoinDesk.  Still, efforts to advance a decentralized group can be compared to herding cats – for one, developers don't have a ""magical relationship"" with exchanges just by proxy of exchanges using the protocol developers work on, Spagni said.  ""If I want to talk to Poloniex [for example], I have to go open a support ticket and pester them to push that up. I don't have anyone on speed dial,"" he said, pointing out that the process of determining consensus takes much more time and effort than people generally think.  Bitcoin Core developers spoke about these same struggles in interacting with a diverse and distributed community last year as members were looking to revamp the process of proposing code changes to allow more people to understand the consensus mechanism.  Yet, even with Core's willingness to bring others into the discussion, they were still looked at as the omnipotent dictators of bitcoin's future by some.  As it's advertised as a leaderless system, it remains unclear whether various user groups should advocate for changes – and how. For example, the Segwit2x agreement, a formalization of software changes put forth by businesses and miners, riled many for violating ""community"" processes largely followed by developers.  The difficult thing is that, given that these processes are often unspoken, they are hard to define.  In absence of any right or wrong, any group is capable of drawing its own lines, and just as equally, holding other groups accountable (sometimes angrily) to their violations.  A harder fork  There's also the matter of whether to look at bitcoin's recent scaling upgrade (and split) as a success or failure.  Ultimately, while the sudden creation of bitcoin cash hasn't been detrimental to bitcoin's price (arguably what many use to determine the cryptocurrency's standing), Spagni would argue that when any formerly united group of blockchain users goes in two different directions, it isn't ideal.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The literal point when the blockchain changes, and those that aren't following the new rules get forked off the new chain, and if that leads to a split, you haven't done your job right.""  And Spagni has some experience with this sort of thing since monero, with its $1.8 billion market cap and more than $55 million in daily volume, hard forks every six months.  These hard forks deliver new features to the protocol and keep the software on the network in sync, meaning nodes aren't running different software and behaving differently, making an unplanned fork more possible.  Instead of the vagueness that comes with voluntary upgrades, Spagni believes strongly there's merit in setting clear checkpoints for upgrades.  Monero uses a process called ""flag-day activation,"" a term that denotes a point at which all nodes and miners switch to different code. This differs from bitcoin's ""threshold activation,"" in which nodes and miners must signal support for a change for it to be locked in and activated.  The latter is what Bitcoin Core used to activate Segregated Witness.  ""From our perspective, things like miners are an important part of the ecosystems, but typically and traditionally in bitcoin … we've given them more importance than they probably should have,"" Spagni said.  For instance, while it's typically been fine to have miners in control on signaling soft fork support and activation, that wasn't the case with SegWit, according to Spagni.  ""When trying to activate SegWit, which was not a particularly controversial or shouldn't have been a particularly controversial upgrade, [threshold activation] gave miners veto power,"" he said.  And so monero has kept voting out of its equation.  Do not feed the trolls  According to Spagni, no monero users have jumped ship because of its more aggressive hard-forking process.  While Spagni said two users complained about the increased size of a new transaction type in a recent update, he notes they were simply ignored due to overwhelming community support for the change. And overlooking people playing the opposition is something Spagni doesn't think is particularly insensitive.  Zooko Wilcox, founding member of another privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, zcash, agrees.  While he advocates for softer tactics, like setting a positive example and asking people to ""play nice"" first, there are times when people cross the line.  And Wilcox has no problem socially excluding people if they cross it.  ""Individuals or groups who do more harm than they contribute, they can be excluded from the conversation. It's a good thing, not a bad thing, that you can exclude people from a seat at your table,"" Wilcox told CoinDesk.  Although, these protocols are riding a fine line of duplicity – and Spagni admits it:  ""It's difficult as a community to encourage people to ask hard questions and continuously test each other, but on the other hand, unite when someone doesn't follow the groupthink and reject people and eject people who are causing division.""  You've got an upgrade  Seemingly because of this notion blockchain participants should be given choice, Wilcox has adopted a softer fork method.  In his mind, splits should be easy and safe, but also predictable. In an effort to create this environment, Wilcox points to several features zcash offers.  The first is replay protection, where transactions on one chain are protected from being duplicated on the chain that hard forked. The process has been discussed in depth in bitcoin circles, since many Core supporters contend that Bitcoin Cash doesn't have adequate replay protection.  Secondly, Wilcox highlighted the reference client's auto-self-deprecation feature, which orders the client to turn itself off 18 weeks after an upgraded release.  If a user has not upgraded to the newest software, they'll receive a message once the client is turned on again, saying the software ""is too old to be reliable for following the zcash blockchain, so you need to go upgrade to a newer version of me,"" said Wilcox.  This is nearly opposite of bitcoin. Actually, bitcoin's mechanisms for pushing people to upgrade are nearly non-existent, and Wilcox believes this has something to do with much of the community believing any small push from an individual or group of people is the beginning stages of coercion.  ""There's almost a sense … an implicit or unspoken thought [some in the community] might be having, that this is wrong, that it's necessary and morally imperative to support arbitrarily old versions of the software,"" said Wilcox.  While people can use old versions of the zcash software, but they won't get the zcash team's attention on diagnosing and fixing bugs and other performance upgrades.  Wilcox concluded:  ""But we have opposite sense. We think it's necessary and morally imperative to communicate clearly to users which versions we support and which we don’t.""  Yet, controversy remains between which of these two ways – the methodical single arbitrator of the future versus an open, chaotic free for all – is the better one forward for securing consensus within cryptocurrency protocols. But maybe, a winner doesn't need to come out of this dyad, but an acceptance that both ways have their reasons for existing.

42400420,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYTV,1505725251,Russian Central Bank Strikes Restrictive Tone on Cryptocurrency,"The chief of Russia's central bank has reportedly spoken out against regulation that would classify cryptocurrency as a traditional financial instrument.  In comments last week at an event in Sochi, Bank of Russia governor Elvira Nabiullina, who previously served as President Vladimir Putin's economic adviser, she said she specifically opposes any policy that would deem the technology comparable to foreign currency, payment instruments or ""monetary assets,"" though she stopped short of suggesting what determination she would ultimately support.  According to Sputnik, Nabiullina said:  ""We are categorically opposed to introducing cryptocurrencies in regulation as a monetary asset, an asset used to pay for goods and services, are against equating it with foreign currencies, because … there is foreign currency, there are states that produce it, there are economies and central banks that are behind it.""  That same day, another official from the Bank of Russia, deputy governor Dmitry Skobelkin, also took a hard-line approach when speaking with reporters after a meeting with representatives of the Chinese government, according to Bloomberg.  ""China doesn't recognize cryptocurrency as payment and forbids ICOs,"" he said. ""Our views are absolutely similar. In our view, it's a sort of a financial pyramid that may collapse at any moment.""  But while notable, it's important to remember that the Bank of Russia, though overseeing monetary policy, does not regulate domestic financial policy (a task overseen by the Ministry of Finance) or introduce new laws (a responsibility of the Russian parliament).  Nonetheless, the comments come at a time when all three groups continue to deliberate how best to regulate the emerging technology. Already, regulation on cryptocurrency trading is expected this year, which could result in some kind of specific definition for cryptocurrencies under state law.  A senior official from the State Duma, Russia's national legislature, recently predicted that work on this front will be completed by the end of the fall.

42400421,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYUU,1505721648,Now Boarding: Is AXA's Ethereum Test Blockchain's Ticket Mainstream?,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.      As summer draws to a sultry close in the northern hemisphere, we should all spare a thought for those whose holidays were marred by lost luggage, hotel complications and very strange weather.  However, one bane of the frequent traveller – delayed flights – could soon have had its day, and blockchain could play a leading role. That's because this past week, French insurance giant AXA unveiled a test run of a blockchain platform designed to manage flight insurance.  Amusingly called ""Fizzy,"" the product is a network of smart contracts linked to a platform based on ethereum that will scan data sources for information on delayed flights. If those flights match an outstanding insurance policy, a pay-out is automatically triggered.  While the initial test is limited in scope – for now it only covers direct flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and the U.S. – its significance is potentially huge.  On the radar  Travel insurance is not a new concept – policies guaranteeing compensation for cancellations, lost luggage, etc., date back to the late 1800s. But, boosted by terrorism and extreme climate, it has enjoyed spectacular growth over the past few years, a trend that is generally expected to continue.  That said, the sector itself has not kept pace with innovations in the travel industry, and – in spite of a surge of insurtech startups aiming to disrupt the way insurance operates – mainstream policies are structured and executed in much the same way as 50 years ago.  This project, however, breaks ground, not only in the technology used, but also in its focus and market approach.  While a handful of independent blockchain startups have taken a run at flight insurance, Fizzy is the first such project to be launched by an incumbent, and the first to make it to the mainstream market.  Currently in beta with limited route coverage, AXA plans to roll the scheme out internationally next year.  Plane truth  Fizzy is also an early working example of an emerging sub-genre of ""parametric insurance"" – rather than compensate for loss, it originates a pre-established pay-out based on a triggering event.  Traditionally limited to large-company catastrophe bonds, parametric insurance has the potential to streamline risk management, lower costs and increase customer satisfaction by removing uncertainty.  This could be where blockchain technology has its most significant impact on the insurance sector. Executed on technology platforms, parametric policies can ""go small,"" cover a wider range of eventualities and reach a much broader audience.  But why blockchain? Why couldn’t a distributed database work? Because of the underlying issue of trust, often absent from personal insurance.  As most of us unfortunately know, getting an insurer to transfer compensation is often a frustrating battle. A blockchain platform can remove the need to save receipts, submit paperwork and request pay-out authorization. It can also remove the required leap of faith that the issuer will honor the trigger, since the embedded conditions cannot be modified.  Flight path  Although the first mainstream test is focused on flights, it could be expanded to cover other types of transport. It could also end up both fragmenting and streamlining areas such as home and health coverage.  If a police record of theft is uploaded, an X-ray is performed, smart car sensors detect an incident or hurricane-induced floods reach a certain level, a pay-out is automatic.  In this light, the name that AXA chose for the service is surprisingly appropriate. In fizzy drinks, small bubbles transform a liquid substance into a more cheerful experience. In insurance, small parametric contracts could end up transforming how we interact with the sector – starting with personal insurance, but possibly spilling over into corporate and life policies.  More accessible coverage for customers, lower costs along with a broader market for issuers and the emergence of a new type of financial security... This small blockchain-based travel insurance experiment is giving us a glimpse of what the insurance business could look like in 10 years' time.
