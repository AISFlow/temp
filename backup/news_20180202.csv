42400987,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZgF,1517612126,"Report: Bank of America, JP Morgan Ban Credit Crypto Purchases","Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase will reportedly no longer enable customers to purchase bitcoin with credit cards starting in February, reports say.  Revealed today in a Bloomberg report, JPMorgan is expected to start its ban on Feb. 3 due to concerns about the credit risk of those who make purchases through their cards. Bank of America is said to be launching its ban on Feb. 2, when transactions with known cryptocurrency exchanges will begin to be declined.  The Bank of America ban is limited to credit cards, and will not impact customers who wish to purchase cryptocurrencies using debit or ATM cards, according to the news source.  Bloomberg further reported that the Bank of America cited anti-money laundering regulations for the move, as well as the potential for thieves to convert stolen credit cards into cryptocurrency stashes.  Like JPMorgan, Bank of America is also concerned with the idea customers can purchase more cryptocurrency than they can afford. Other banks have purportedly moved to increase charges for crypto transactions in recent weeks.  Stepping back, move coincides with a broader discussion among financial firms about how their businesses are being impacted by the cryptocurrency economy, which after growing by leaps and bounds in 2017, has seen a sizable market drawdown so far this year.

Harvest Portfolios, an independent Canadian investment management company, filed the preliminary paperwork for its Blockchain Technologies ETF (ticker: HBLK) in January, seeking to provide Canadian investors with the opportunity to buy into the blockchain technology sector, according to the Globe and Mail.  The fund will invest ""in equity securities of issuers exposed, directly or indirectly to the development and implementation of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies,"" a Harvest Portfolios statement said. The company intends for the ETF to track blockchain technology projects, mirroring its Harvest Blockchain Technologies Index.  According to the Globe and Mail, two other Canadian companies, First Trust Portfolios Canada and Evolve Funds Group Inc., are also seeking to launch blockchain funds, and filed their first prospectuses with regulators this week.  First Trust is already a presence in the U.S. market, offering its blockchain ETF under the ticker LEGR. The introduction in Canada of its First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF (ticker: BLCK), modeled after the Indxx Blockchain Index, is the product of client demand, the company said.

Its fund will invest in ""equity securities of issuers that are involved in the research, development, or utilization of blockchain technologies, or involved in the supply chain for blockchain applications including technology hardware,"" the company said in a statement.

42400993,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZlA,1517602539,Santander to Roll Out Ripple-Powered App in 4 Countries,"Ripple has landed one of its largest clients yet, with Santander Group announcing a mobile app powered by the company’s distributed ledger.  The bank had been piloting the app for 18 months with its employees, integrating Apple Pay for payments between £10 and £10,000 ($14 and $14,000), according to Finextra. The app will be rolled out in Spain, Brazil, the U.K. and Poland, according to the company’s 2017 earnings presentation.  Customers will be able to use the app to facilitate same-day cross-border payments in under a minute, according to the slide. The app will also provide a digital wallet, a personal finance manager and help aid person-to-person payments.  A Santander spokesperson said the company plans to launch the app in the next few months, and that it will use Ripple's xCurrent in the project.  Ripple's xCurrent product does not use XRP, the company's native cryptocurrency.  Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse announced the move to his followers on Twitter, noting that the app will be released this quarter.  Here's A Billion  Separately, Ripple spent about $84 million of XRP from its nearly $1 billion January reserve last month, according to current market prices.  The company had access to 1 billion XRP last month, meaning the remaining 900 million went back into escrow at the end of January. The funds were transferred back through two transactions, with the 900 million XRP holding a value of $756 million at press time.  The company has 61 billion XRP valued at $51 billion locked up in escrow over the next four years through a series of smart contracts.  Ripple’s escrow movement was developed as a way to increase trust in XRP. Due to Ripple’s own holdings, limiting access to the tokens from even the developers prevented massive token dumps which could tank the price.  Each month, 1 billion XRP is released to the company for internal use. While in the past, Ripple used on average some 300 million XRP per month, it appears to be requiring fewer of its reserve tokens, at least according to this one data point.

The Smominru botnet, which infected more than 526,000 Windows servers at its peak, has been used to mine 8,900 monero tokens since it first started appearing in May 2017, according to ZDNet. The botnet is based on the Windows exploit EternalBlue, which was developed by the U.S. National Security Agency and leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacker group last year. Eternal Blue was subsequently deployed in conjunction with another NSA-developed exploit, DoublePulsar, in the WannaCry attack.  Windows servers have been the botnet's primary victims, which ZDNet notes are ideal hosts because they are always turned on and have more processing capacity than a personal computer. The majority of affected machines are reportedly located in Russia, India and Taiwan, though the attack spans the globe.  Attempts to curtail the botnet have had only short-term success thus far. Cybersecurity workers from Proofpoint, abuse.ch and the ShadowServer Foundation attempted to eradicate the botnet using a technique called ""sinkholing,"" but the Smominru quickly recovered.  As CoinDesk has previously reported, monero has increasingly been implicated with cybercrime, likely because transactions, the coins used in transactions and transaction histories associated with monero are all private.  Last year  , the previously mentioned exploit, DoublePulsar, was used to facilitate the secret installation of monero mining malware.

42400998,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZo7,1517587857,Copycat Twitter Accounts Seek to Scam Crypto Users,"A number of Twitter accounts masquerading as notable cryptocurrency developers and startups have been soliciting funds with promises of major gains.  With the rise in value and popularity of cryptos, such scam accounts have been on the rise – asking for small donations of various cryptocurrencies on the social media platform. In exchange, these scams promise, they will later send several times the amount donated back to the originating address.  Often this exchange will come under the guise of a giveaway: a ""developer"" will encourage fans to donate within a limited period to be able to participate, or they only send funds to the first 50 or 100 users responding.  What is notable (and disappointing) about these accounts, though, is that several of them appear to have been successful in scamming cryptocurrencies from users.  Data collected by CoinDesk indicates that these users have received a combined total in the thousands of dollars over the last several days.  For example, user @SatoshiLitev, copying the username of litecoin creator Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) offered to donate four litecoins to the first 60 people to donate a fraction of one to an address. According to Block Cypher, the address received a total of 11.5 litecoin (worth $1489.56 at press time). The coins were transferred to other addresses soon after.  Similarly, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) has several copycats.  One, @VittaliBuuteri, offered to send two ether tokens to anyone who sent him 0.1 tokens. Etherscan data indicates that while people sent him ethereum, he did not send any back to those specific addresses. Another user, @vitalic_buterin, made a similar offer. Etherscan showed he had a balance of 2 ether from several donations as of Thursday night.  Individuals are not the only ones being copied. A copycat of Ripple, the company behind the XRP token, offered to donate 100,000 tokens to the community provided individuals first sent it 100 XRP. The account, @RippleOfficial, took pains to ensure it looked like the real Ripple account (@Ripple) by tweeting and retweeting the same posts as the company account.  And of course, some of the developers being copied are not happy about the trend.  Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse commented that ""impersonators [have] (frustratingly) become very relevant"" after ""@bgarlinghaus"" tried to scam his followers.  The account has since been suspended by Twitter, but cached archives from Google show the user offered to donate 1 million XRP tokens in exchange for smaller donations on at least two occasions. It is unclear whether any XRP was sent to the user's address.  Similarly, Vitalik Buterin commented on Wednesday that deleting scam accounts one at a time was ineffective, advocating for a system that would filter copycat accounts or a ""better reputation system.""  His concern was that there were more than 800 possible permutations of his name by changing a single character. Changing two characters increased that number to nearly 350,000. As if to prove his point, the account Buterin was specifically referencing was suspended, but in his tweet responses people listed at least two more scam accounts.  It is unclear what efforts Twitter is making to remove these scam accounts on a larger scale, though at least two accounts have already been suspended.  The ethereum creator later joked about the situation, saying if anyone sends him 0.1 ether, he will respond with nothing as he is ""too lazy.""

Speaking at the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Mnuchin said that he does not believe cryptocurrencies are threat to the financial market stability, though he is concerned about their use in money laundering and other illegal activities, NHK reportshttps://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20180131_14/.  If held, the talks notably wouldn't mark the first time that a major global summit saw such dialogue, with a meeting of the G7 nations – a group comprised of the world's largest economies – having discussed the matter as far back as 2015.  This time around, however, Mnuchin is not alone in seeking the dialogue, as French finance minister Bruno Le Maire put out a similar call in December for such talks to coincide with the meeting. At the time, he cited the risk of market speculation as a top concern.  Still, Mnuchin's plan comes weeks after he stated that U.S. finance regulators are forming a digital currency working group, one that would aim to investigate the nascent market.  ""We are very focused on cryptocurrencies,"" he stated, adding that it is the job of regulators to ensure it is not misused or abused.

42400992,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZkB,1517578320,Red Tide: Double-Digit Losses Sweep Crypto Asset Market,"The cryptocurrency markets are a sea of red today, with all the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap reporting double-digit percentage losses for the last 24 hours (at press time).  Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped 16 percent over the same period to 10-week lows below $8,000, and is heading towards its worst weekly loss (more than 25 percent) since April 2013.  The cryptocurrency suffered a 30-percent drop in January and is down 45 percent on a year-to-date basis.  Cardano (ADA) is the biggest loser in the top 10, and is down 37 percent.  Ethereum's ether (ETH) token is down by 28 percent. The cryptocurrency had looked relatively resilient earlier this week, reportedly due to institutional capital flows and Venezuela's decision to presale petro cryptocurrency on the ethereum platform. However, the bull grip looks to have weakened and ETH was last seen trading around $785, it's lowest so far in 2018.  Meanwhile, Ripple's XRP token ranks third on the list of losers with a 35 percent drop. The cryptocurrency has now fallen to $0.635 – its lowest level since Dec. 15. That follows XRP’s bad start to the year, with a 49 percent fall during January.  As seen in the graph, IOTA, NEO, EOS and litecoin have all also posted losses greater than 20 percent.  Overall, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies taken together has dropped more than $100 billion, to below $400 billion for the first time in 2018.  Further down the chart, striking a rare positive note amid the gloom and doom, a gold-backed token named DigixDAO (DGD) stands out after having posted 30 percent gains.

42401009,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZu1,1517574636,Texas Takes Aim at Overseas ICO with Cease-and-Desist,"A state securities regulator in Texas has put out yet another cease-and-desist order on cryptocurrency-related activities.  According to an emergency order signed on Jan. 24, the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) is taking aim at a Hong Kong-based firm dubbed R2B Coin, which the agency alleges is issuing unregistered securities to Texas residents with false and misleading information.  According to the R2B website, the firm says its pre-mined cryptocurrency ""R2B Coin"" will have an offering price ranging from $0.008 to $188. It further claims that ""R2B Coins will reach $200 within three months after the start of trading, and will be among top 10 currencies in 1–1.5 years.""  The state agency states that such offering, which is being promoted by ""misleading and deceptive"" information, falls under the definition of securities.  While the firm claims to be globally licensed, the Texas regulator said R2B is not registered in its jurisdiction and thus has violated securities regulations by soliciting investors from Texas through a series of conference calls.  The document further details that the company has allegedly claimed to have 14,500 investors participating in the project from 34 countries including the U.S., Sweden, Italy and India. It has also allegedly promoted R2B Coin's potential by making misleading promises; for example, that investors may swap their tokens for public stocks at exchanges in Hong Kong or New York.  As such the Texas agency is seeking the emergency order to halt R2B Coin's activity targeting residents in Texas. R2B Coin has 31 days after reception of the order to file an appeal. The firm has not responded to an email enquiry sent by CoinDesk for comments.  The cease-and-desist is the state's third against a crypto company since December last year, signalling the agency's increasing oversight over cryptocurrency related investments. Previously, it has also given similar orders to Dubai-based USI-Tech, as well as BitConnect, which was subsequently shut down and is now facing mounting class action suits.

42401007,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZwy,1517571901,Bitcoin Slides Towards $8K Amid Market Slump,"Down more than 25 percent week-on-week, bitcoin could be heading for its worst weekly loss since April 2013.  The sell-off gathered pace today with prices hitting a 10-week low below $8,100, but a relief could be in the offing, technical charts indicate.  Having breached the psychological support level of $9,000 earlier today, prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) fell to $8,056.51 at 11:39 UTC; its lowest level since Nov. 25. On a 24-hour basis, the cryptocurrency is down 14 percent, according to data source OnChinaFX.  Also, it is worth noting that BTC prices on Korean exchanges now trade at a discount to prices on western exchanges. For instance, BTC is changing hands at $8,227 on Coinbase's GDAX exchange, while on Bithumb, it's at $7,960. So, prices on Korean exchanges are trading at a discount of more than $250.  Till last month, the premium on Korean exchanges (known as the ""Kimchi premium"") was so high that it would distort the global average price of bitcoin. Thus, on Jan. 8 data source CoinMarketCap decided to exclude Korean prices from average calculations.  Bitcoin is not the only one taking a beating today. Ripple's XRP token has depreciated by 31 percent in the last 24 hours. Ethereum's ether token, bitcoin cash, NEO, and litecoin are down at least 20 percent each. Further, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies together has declined by over $100 billion in 24 hours.  Since the start of the year, cryptocurrency markets have been hit by a string of negative news. For example, fears of tighter regulation in China and South Korea rocked the bitcoin freight train in January.  While things are looking bleak currently, the charts indicate there may be some glimmer of good new ahead.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows-  BTC is fast approaching $8,052 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to high).  The 200-day MA support is lined up at $7,855.  BTC risks breaching the falling channel on the downside.  The relative strength index (RSI) and stochastic show oversold conditions.  A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,052 would only strengthen the bears. It would also mark a downside break of the falling channel (represented by lines joining lower highs and lower lows).  However, as noted above, the daily indicators show oversold conditions. Further, the 4-hour RSI and stochastic also show the sell-off is overdone. Hence, BTC will likely defend the 200-day MA support seen at $7,855.  View  The sell-off could come to a halt in the range of $7,855 (200-day MA) and $8,052 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to high).  Technical recovery could be seen, but gains above the $9,000 mark could be short-lived in the short-term.  Consolidation around $8,000 over the next 72 hours, if followed by a daily close (as per UTC) below the 200-day MA could revive the sell-off and open doors for $6,189 (Oct. 21 high).

According to a report from Nikkei, inspectors from the Financial Services Agency (FSA) arrived in Coincheck's office this morning to examine whether the firm has the financial capability to fulfill its promise that it would compensate users who lost funds in the major breach.  As reported by CoinDesk, Coincheck, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan, saw 500 million NEM token stolen on Jan. 26, resulting in a loss of $533 million at the time from around 260,000 users.  Following the hack, Coincheck announced on Jan. 27 that it would issue compensation at a rate of $0.81 for each stolen token, which would amount to a total payout of $420 million.  The FSA then stepped in on Jan. 29 and gave an administrative order to Coincheck, requiring the exchange to report by Feb. 13 on its investigation on causes of the hack, as well as its plans for security improvements.  Yet, whether Coincheck is in a position to fulfill its compensation promise has raised questions from FSA. The on-site inspection reported today comes as the first instance in which regulators in Japan have taken oversight over cryptocurrency exchanges to a physical level for investor protection.  As of press time, the agency has yet to release a formal statement regarding the result of its inspection.  Yet, according to another report by Reuters, the FSA said on Friday that it has already ordered Coincheck to fix its security loophole, which was also one reason FSA has yet to approve Coincheck as an exchange.

42401012,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZyw,1517562027,January's Top Large Cap Crypto? Not Bitcoin or Ether...,"January turned out to be a difficult month for the cryptocurrency markets.  Bitcoin, the world's largest currency by market capitalization, dropped close to 30 percent, meaning its market capitalization shaved off billions after a torrid end to 2017. Meanwhile, excitement seemed to fade as the total value of all cryptocurrencies taken together topped out at $830 billion on Jan. 7, ending the month below $500 billion.  However, amid the gloom and doom, a few small-cap tokens managed to put on a good show.  For instance, names like VeChain, NEO, Populous and Stellar dominated the list of gainers among the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (as of Jan. 31).  Here's a closer look at their performance.  VeChain  Boasting an association with enterprise firms in Chinahttps://www.pwccn.com/en/press-room/press-releases/pr-150517.html, VeChain has been aiming to use an open blockchain network to revolutionize the internet of things (IoT) since late 2016.  But despite the partnerships, it hadn't garnered much attention throughout 2017's cryptocurrency boom, trading under $1 as recently as December, up from as low as $0.20 in November.  That seems to have now changed, as the blockchain recently announced it will be rebranding VeChain (VEN) into VeChain Thor (VET/THOR) this month, a plan of action that may have sparked the interest of investors eager to chase gains in a cooling market.

Still, the retail market has shown a strong interest. Launched in Dec. 2016, neo weathered the storm created by China's ICO ban in September last year to rebound with a strong start to 2018, possibly due to its innovative features.

Singular focus  The Commission's announcement specifically emphasized its desire to mobilize the blockchain for the benefit of the single European market, and noted that a primary objective of the Observatory and Forum is to build on existing projects to make sure they work across borders.  Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society Mariya Gabriel commented:  ""I see the blockchain as a game changer and I want Europe to be at the forefront of its development. We need to establish the right enabling environment – a Digital Single Market for blockchain so that all citizens can benefit, instead of a patchwork of initiatives.

42380305,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MpPR,1517547648,"Tezos Has a New Board, But What About the Money?","The on-chain governance protocol Tezos, long stalled by its own crisis of governance, lurched forward in several notable ways this week.  To begin, Johann Gevers, president of the Swiss-based Tezos Foundation kicked off events by publishing a blog post outlining his intent to use the project's proceeds to hire operational staff (before later deleting it). Then on Wednesday, the foundation announcedhttps://tezosfoundation.ch/news/tezos-foundation-appoints-new-board-member/ it had named a new board member, Lars Haussmann, to replace a seat left vacant in December.  Not to be outdone, that same day, a grassroots group aiming to empower the project's founders, a husband-and-wife team who have long been at odds with Gevers, set their own chess pieces in motion. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, a new Swiss Foundation, called T2, will launch with the intent of charting an alternate path to market. (The T2 effort actually consists of two organizations, a foundation and an association).  Taken together, the events mark the latest phase of a drama that began in July, when Tezos raised $232 million, a record fundraising at the time, in an initial coin offering (ICO).  According to the WSJ, the Tezos Foundation has control of those funds, denominated in bitcoin and ether.  But what's less clear is what a new foundation could do to assert control over the funds.  ""In the short term this is really just to show that the community has a real voice and say here. It's been very clear to me that the community and the foundation are not in line at all,"" Polychain Capital founder and T2 board member Olaf Carlson-Wee told CoinDesk.  Carlson-Wee said that he had previously applied to be a member of the Tezos Foundation but was rejected, a move that led him to join T2's seven-member board.  The T2 Foundation was formed by Ryan Jesperson, a member of the Tezos Community who explained in a YouTube video Thursday that he personally funded hiring a Swiss attorney to represent Tezos backers to the authority that supervises these organizations in the country.  He explained to CoinDesk:  ""We hope that the Foundation Authority will help fix the situation. That is part of the purpose of the Foundation Authority, to make sure that Foundations fulfill their charter.""  Nuclear option  Regardless, T2 has something of a nuclear option available to it.  While the Swiss-based Tezos Foundation controls all the contributions made in the ICO, Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), the corporate entity for the project's creators, holds the keys to something that might ultimately prove more valuable: the technology's codebase.  Along with today's announcement, the T2 Foundation published an FAQ as a public Google document, and in that document, it proposes a radical option – that DLS would release the codebase with the same genesis block as planned.  In this scenario, everyone would get the Tezos tokens they paid for, but the reserve tokens (10 percent of the total pool, vesting over four years) would be turned over to the control of T2 rather than the Tezos Foundation.  If that happened and T2 took over supporting development, ""resources would not be a problem,"" Jesperson wrote.  That is, assuming that DLS goes along with the plan and is legally capable of doing so under its ""contractual agreement"" with the Tezos Foundation. (Neither DLS nor the Tezos Foundation responded to requests for comment from CoinDesk.)  Jesperson said, ""This is a grassroots driven effort, but DLS is aware of what is happening and will ultimately make the decision on what they want to do.""  T2 would prefer for Tezos to proceed as originally planned, provided the community supporting it gets more of a voice.  Jesperson added:  ""This is not about one foundation being right or wrong, it is about preparing a place for the network to launch and making sure that resources are used for their intended purpose, to support the Tezos protocol.""  What's gone wrong?  Still, it's hard to see how likely the scenario above may be. For one, CoinDesk has been unable to confirm how much funds have or have not been distributed by the foundation to DLS for development of the protocol.  ""To me there's two legitimate paths: one is you allocate resources and support the community,"" Carlson-Wee said. ""The other path is don't do it, and be extremely transparent about why.""  However Carlson-Wee argues that the Tezos Foundation has taken a third path: not allocating resources and not explaining why.  Some of the most needed resources cost little or nothing, he argued, saying that such a project should have basic community building, at a minimum: meetups, conferences, newsletters and blog posts. Additionally, it could also benefit from grants for beneficial but less lucrative projects, such as developing block explorers.  None of those things have happened. If the T2 Foundation isn't able to accomplish anything else, it should be able to start moving some of that community building forward.  Of course, it's essential that community has a protocol to organize itself around. Carlson-Wee has been watching the developments of Tezos codebase closely, via Github and the developers' weekly YouTube posts.  ""Given the circumstances, I think it's pretty impressive what they've accomplished,"" Carlson-Wee said.  How it ends  In the background, accusations in the community have gotten heated. The Tezos Reddit, for example, has crowdsourced a professional history of the Tezos Foundation's president and former business partners published a similar account on Medium.  Meanwhile, the Tezos Foundation itself has launched a website that doesn't appear in the internet archive before Feb. 1, and all Gevers' old blog posts have been deleted from Medium.  All the while, class action cases against DLS and the Tezos Foundation have been stacking up.  Stephen Palley, an attorney with Anderson Kill in Washington who has long observed Tezos, asked whether the T2 founders were ""thinking of how it will look in light of the pending litigation"" in a phone call with CoinDesk.  All of the documents and accusations released in the public sphere can be submitted as evidence to the fact that this is a project in disarray, he argued.  ""On the contrary, T2 gives all of the contributors more confidence that one way or another the Tezos network will launch and the lawsuits will be dismissed,"" Jesperson argued.  With a larger board and with more robust dispute resolution procedures, he believes T2 has been designed not to be beset by the Tezos Foundation's trouble.  ""The most important part of the project, the code, is getting close to being ready,"" Jesperson wrote.  Carlson-Wee agreed, arguing that DLS's work is too far along to justify the lawsuits proceeding, concluding:  ""I think before anything really comes of that the network will go live.""

42380301,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MpKP,1517540437,US Commodities Regulator Beefs Up Bitcoin Futures Review,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is developing a ""heightened review process"" for cryptocurrency futures though it will continue to allow exchanges to self-certify products, Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo announced last week.  As reported by Reuters, Giancarlo introduced a checklist during a conference speech in Florida pertaining to Designated Market Contracts (DMCs) and Derivatives Clearing Organizations (DCOs). The aim is to assist regulators as exchanges introduce new products around cryptocurrencies into the market.  The chairman's speech came after some pushback tied to the CFTC's handling of the December launch of bitcoin futures by the Cboe Global Markets and the CME Group, after which the Futures Industry Association (FIA) expressed concern over potentially having to pay for outstanding bitcoin futures contracts caused by the cryptocurrency's volatility. The Association claimed it wasn't sufficiently included in the process and criticized the Commission for allowing exchanges to self-certify their futures products.  Giancarlo's checklist requires that DMCs set ""exchange large trader reporting thresholds at five bitcoins or less"". It also mandates that they must enter into ""information sharing agreements with spot market platforms to allow access to trade and trader data"" in addition to agreeing to frequent communication with the CFTC regarding trade activities.  Beyond such measures, the CFTC will leave the self-certification process alone, according to Giancarlo.  He was quoted as saying:  ""The CFTC's current product self-certification framework is consistent with public policy that encourages market-driven innovation that has made America's listed futures markets the envy of the world. Whatever the market impact of bitcoin futures, I hope it is not to compromise the product self-certification process that has served so well for so long"".  Others have been scrutinizing the process as well, including some members of the U.S. Congress.  Yesterday, top Senate Agricultural Committee members sent a letter to Giancarlo requesting information on the CFTC's oversight of bitcoin futures and options markets.
