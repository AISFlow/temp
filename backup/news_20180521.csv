42429112,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrkHh,1526925984,Walmart Looks to Blockchain for Retail Product Resales,"A new patent application from retail giant Walmart shows how blockchain could be used to augment its digital offerings for consumers.  The document, released last Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, outlines a blockchain ledger which would track the items that stores sell to a particular customer. It's the latest example of an intellectual property play by Walmart, which has filed a number of related applications and has also piloted the tech for tracking food products.  The proposed system would allow a customer to register the item after it's bought for the first time. The customer would then be able to choose a price for a resale, with the system itself acting essentially as a digital marketplace, according to the application.  Perhaps just as notable is the fact that the application appears to work in details from another use case – distributed delivery tracking – that was outlined in a past patent filing.  Walmart's latest application explains how a ""distributed delivery record blockchain"" would be updated as products move from the seller to the courier to the buyer, with new transactions signifying each step.  The company wrote:  ""By one approach, the transfer from the seller to the courier may require signatures from both the sender and the courier using their respective private keys. The new transaction may be broadcasted and verified by the sender, the courier, the buyer, and/or other nodes on the system before being added to the distributed delivery record blockchain. When the package is transferred from the courier to the buyer, the courier may use the courier's private key to authorize the transfer of the digital asset representing the physical asset from the courier to the buyer and update the delivery record with the new transaction.""  The idea of Walmart actually pursuing such a use case isn't that far-fetched – last September, the retailer detailed how it was testing automated delivery solutions with a limited group of customers in California.

The Commission announced the findings Monday in an annual scams report, also noting that the rise in crypto-related scams corresponded with an increase in coin prices through 2017. Of the more than $2 million lost in 2017, scams cost consumers approximately $100,000 per month between January and September, the report said. However in December - when bitcoin's price skyrocketed to nearly $20,000 - consumers reported losses exceeding $700,000, the Commission said.  The report indicated that fake ICOs, crypto-related pyramid schemes and ransomware payments were common means of swindling consumers.  The Commission said it expects crypto-related fraud to continue, noting, ""as with other scams, this is likely the very tip of the iceberg.""  That being said, the report noted, Australians in general lost more than $340 million in scams overall, with $64 million being lost to investment scams specifically last year.  Stepping back, the report highlights one instance of an epidemic of scams that spans the globe.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, just seven prominent scams, hacks and attacks in 2017 resulted in the loss of around $490 million of consumer funds. Likewise, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that of the 1,450 ICOs it reviewed, 271 had ""red flags that include plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns and missing or fake executive teams.""

42429130,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrkNh,1526918659,A New Startup Has Zooko and Naval Betting on Better Crypto Contracts,"If a series of high-profile vulnerabilities weren't enough to persuade you that today's smart contracts are insecure, a group of computer scientists that have been researching the tech since the 1980s just might.  Announced Monday, computer scientists Mark Miller, Dean Tribble, Brian Warner and Bill Tulloh have launched a new startup, Agoric, to develop a secure, blockchain-agnostic programming language based on javascript. The launch comes with a seed investment from a notable group of backers including Naval Ravikant, Polychain Capital and Zcash Company, the for-profit institution that manages the development of privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash.  According to the team, the language will allow programmers to code in a more intuitive and secure manner, while allowing for the kind of formal verification processes that can be a struggle in smart contract testing today.  “In the current blockchain environment for smart contracts, security is a major impediment to having it grow into the larger economy and mainstream applications,” Tribble said.  He told CoinDesk:  “We have security and smart contracting approaches that can address that, and make it so that typical application programmers can program their typical application problems using smart contracting technology.”    By building upon popular programming language, javascript, the founders argue the language will open smart contract development up to a wider range of developers.    “Now with the enablers in javascript, we can bring the massive amount of javascript programmers into this new world,” Miller, who left a 10-year position at Google to found the startup, said.  Miller continued, saying that the new language should also facilitate communication between smart contracts running on different networks, potentially in the future enabling peer-to-peer trades of different cryptocurrencies.  “The overall contract and relationship can span different environments,” Miller, who has been a member of the javascript standards committee, TC39, for many years, said. “It could bring about the all-or-nothing swap of assets.”  A notable team  But it's perhaps the experience of the founders that most differentiates the project.  During CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference last week, zcash creator Zooko Wilcox could not praise Miller enough because of his foresight into what issues could arise within distributed smart contract development. For instance, Miller co-authored the Agoric Papershttp://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers.html, a founding document for market-based, distributed computation, back in 1988 (before the term 'smart contract' had even been coined).  Yet the others on the team also have impressive pasts. Tulloh and Tribble were both involved in the first smart contracting system, AMiX, while Warner co-founded decentralized cloud storage protocol, Tahoe-LAFS.  But with the new project, the founders are setting their sights on improving what they see as weaknesses within the dominant smart contracting languages of today.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Miller said that while ethereum is very much a “breakthrough system,"" there are aspects of its core programming language, Solidity, that can cause programmers trouble.  Miller said:  “There’s an essential part of the ethereum architecture that leads developers into writing smart contracts with certain vulnerabilities.""  Indeed, researchers have estimated that there are 34,000 vulnerable smart contracts active on the ethereum mainnet today, a problem the founders attribute to fundamental flaws with Solidity.  “And the problem isn’t just bad language design – like solidity is a bad language, we can just make a better language – the problem is architecturally deep, it has to do with the underlying security model,” Miller told CoinDesk.  Miller continued, saying that the core of the problem is that within these systems authorization and identity are connected. With a passport in one hand and a set of keys in another, Miller explained that Agoric’s approach seeks to decouple authorization-based access control, like car keys, from identity-based access, like a passport.  Because on blockchain-based systems, identities and wallets are linked, a switch to an authorization-based model could help protect developers from making expensive mistakes.  Miller told CoinDesk:  “What we’re doing is we’re preserving the basis of authorization-based access control up through all the layers of abstraction, so that all the derivative rights created by smart contracts are as transferable as the tokens.”  An easier audit  Another way Agoric is said to help developers is through an object-oriented approach.  With this, coders can focus on ensuring the security of small, discrete elements that are then amassed into increasingly complicated systems without compromising the underlying components.  “The intuitions object-oriented programmers already have about interacting objects is what we amplify in order to help them reason about security,” Miller said.  Tribble agreed, telling CoinDesk that the questions programmers then ask are as simple as: “Here’s my code, does my bank account escape? Here is the code for my contract, is the money preserved? At a high level, what you can specify is much more accessible to humans.""  This kind of language is advantageous as well because the systems are easier to audit.  Currently, because there aren't many people that are fluent in smart contract languages like Solidity, security reviews are slow and expensive. But according to Tribble, that's not sustainable.  As such, the Agoric team has been working alongside a variety of academics to improve the auditing process, while noting that such methods won't be finalized until a little further down the line.  “We’ve got a lot to build,” Tribble said. “We’ve been working on this for a long time, and we’re just getting started.""  While the team is focused on building the language for developers right now, going forward, Agoric will release open-source toolkits that will allow developers to build in a variety of different environments. And those toolkits will help expand the team's own vision for smart contracts as well, whereby complex machine-human interactions over the Web can happen with ease.  Concluding, Tribble said:  “We have several plans in motion but our primary focus right now is how to help solve these problems and make the market leaps and bounds bigger.""

Dubbed ""Operation Cryptosweep,"" the effort was unveiled during a Monday event hosted by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). Its existence was first reported by the Washington Post and later detailed in releases from the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance (TDCI) as well as the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB).  Cryptosweep, according to statements, constitutes ""nearly 70 inquiries and investigations and 35 pending or completed enforcement actions since the beginning of the month."" More investigations are said to be underway, though it's unclear when any related enforcement actions will be unveiled.  The effort gathered steam in April when a task force comprised of NASAA members was convened ""to begin a coordinated series of investigations into ICOs and cryptocurrency-related investment products,"" the TDCI said. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales were a major focus and officials reportedly identified hundreds for further inquiry.  A representative for the NASAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but others involved in the operation painted a picture of a wide-ranging effort to stamp out fraud. Recent examples of state-based regulatory actions include one that touted false endorsements from celebrities like actress Jennifer Aniston.  “The actions announced today are just the tip of the iceberg,” TDCI Assistant Commissioner Frank Borger-Gilligan said in a statement.

Yet, while the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization suffered a 3.6 percent week-on-week drop in prices, it still outclassed other major names like bitcoin cash (BCH) and EOS, which both reported double-digit losses.  Meanwhile, the previous week's winner zilliqa (ZIL) fell almost 20 percent to become the biggest loser among the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  On the plus side, privacy-focused zcash rallied 50 percent and topped the list of winners as investors cheered a new exchange listing.  Top 3 losers (May 11–18)  Zilliqa (ZIL)  Weekly performance: -19.82 percent  All-time high: $0.2306  Closing price on May 11: $0.1677  Current market price: $0.1455  Rank as per market capitalization: 25  Zilliqa dropped close to 20 percent in the week ended May 18, having rallied 13.8 percent in the previous week. However, the cryptocurrency was overdue for a healthy correction after a solid rally to record high of $0.2306 on May 10.  While the investor community is keenly eyeing a Singapore meetup at which the zilliqa developers will give a preview of its new smart contract language Scilla, the pre-event excitement has not put a bid under the token.  ZIL/BTC daily chart  A break below the May 18 low of 0.00001608 BTC would establish a lower highs and lower lows (bearish setup) pattern and allow a deeper drop to 0.00001430 BTC (50 percent Fibonacci retracement). The 10-day moving average is trending south in favor of the bears.  EOS  Weekly performance: -15.77 percent  All-time high: $22.89  Closing price on May 11: $14.90  Current market price: $13.60  Rank as per market capitalization: 5  EOS fell to three-week lows below $12 last week, according to Bitfinex, indicating the excitement surrounding the coming mainnet launch is no longer boosting its price. However, the cryptocurrency did defend the 50-day moving average (MA) and moved back above $13.00 as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  Notably, the ascending trendline (in red) is still intact, and EOS is trading well above the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages, suggesting the long-run technical outlook remains bullish.  A high volume break above the descending trendline resistance, currently at $15.62, would allow a re-test of record highs around $23.00. On the downside, acceptance below the rising trendline would signal a bearish trend reversal – i.e. the rally from the March 18 low of $3.87 has ended.  Bitcoin cash  Weekly performance: -14.36 percent  All-time high: $4,330  Closing price on May 11: $1,372  Current market price: $1,250  Rank as per market capitalization: 4  Bitcoin cash (BCH) ran into offers around $1,500 on May 13/14 and fell to a low of $1,128 on Bitfinex on Friday – the lowest level since April 22.  A planned software upgrade (or hard fork) to introduce new features came into effect on May 15 as expected, but around 20 percent of nodes have still not upgraded – perhaps negating any potential price boost from the news.  Subsequently, the weekend's rally in bitcoin prices seems to have had a positive impact and BCH did regain bid tone, but it failed to cut through the key moving average, as seen in the chart below.  4-hour chart  BCH is now back below the head-and-shoulders neckline, having faced rejection at the descending (bearish) 50-candle moving average hurdle. As a result, the recent low of $1,128 could again be put to test.  A daily close below that level would mean the rally from the April low of $600 has ended and could yield a drop to levels below the $1,000 mark.  However, a move above $1,500 (last week's high) would put the bulls back in the driver's seat.

42429103,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrk3h,1526904353,Blockchain's Killer App? Making Trade Wars Obsolete,"Pindar Wong is the chairman of VeriFi (Hong Kong) Ltd and a member of CoinDesk's advisory board. An internet pioneer, he co­founded the first licensed Internet Service Provider in Hong Kong in 1993.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed exclusively to attendees of CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 event.      On Hainan Island, China’s Hawaii, in the shadow of sanctions, tit-for-tat tariffs and a looming trade war, China’s paramount leader stood up for globalization last month by launching a surprise defense of world trade. Laudable though his position might be, Xi Jinping’s bargaining position – and that of Donald Trump – may soon be irrelevant.  A confluence of technologies is poised to dramatically reshape the world of manufacturing and, in the process, render obsolete the existing international trade regime. A few get a lot attention: the rise of 3D printing, the application of internet-of-things (IoT) devices to shipping and logistics, the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence and machine learning.  But it’s blockchain technology, with the capacity it gives to non-trusting parties to transact with each other by relying on a common source of digital truth, that will facilitate this disruption. It provides the enabling platform on which a new dynamic, highly fluid global system for exchanging value will emerge, one that’s far outside the purview of the World Trade Organization’s current “rules of origin” model.  Trade warriors are fighting yesterday’s battles. Instead of pitting their smokestack, 20th-century factories and armies of workers against each other, governments should apply blockchain’s ‘Don’t Trust, Verify’ approach to trade arrangements, using it to reduce trade friction and improve cross-border relations to the betterment of their societies.  What might the roadmap look like? That’s what an ad hoc group of Hong Kong’s leading strategists and business thinkers set out to define when they started meeting privately in late 2016 to explore how to fully digitize trade among the 65-plus countries involved in China’s ‘Belt and Road Initiative’.  The Belt and Road Blockchain Consortium, as our group came to be known, recognized that as supply chains evolve into highly automated, data-driven ecosystems, they will need the transparency, immutability and accountability that blockchains provide.  Verifiability and validity  Already, large-scale enterprises like Walmart, IBM and Maersk are deep in blockchain-for-supply chain research and a clutch of exciting startups such as Provenance and Skuchain are building blockchain-based tools for the supply-chain management industry.  But the consortium recognized two important barriers to the widespread adoption of a global blockchain-based trade architecture. The first concerned the desire for legal certainty, and independent verifiability, of unique blockchain identifiers, which are currently often represented as QR (Quick Response) codes. The second concerned the liability and validity of data written to an immutable blockchain, specifically what to do in the case of erroneous – let’s call it #FakeData.  We felt the history of the Internet’s development offers a useful framework for addressing the question of legal verifiability. We saw that verifying a blockchain address is conceptually similar to resolving cross-border accountability issues with Internet Domain Names, which identified a need for a Blockchain Naming Service (BNS), with common business identity standards to interface with sovereign company registries.  Under this model, if coindesk.com wanted to operate a bitcoin wallet, anyone should be able to verify that a bitcoin address was actually administered by CoinDesk LLC, the U.S. company, and not someone else.  As for the data validity issue, we found that it was useful to borrow some of the thinking behind traditional finance notions of security, specifically the KYC, or know-your-customer concept. The intersection of IoT with blockchains drives a need for hardware integrity, which we call KYM (know your machine).  The need for a mechanism for online dispute resolution (ODR), one that lies outside of the blockchain in question, also became apparent to us. In that case, the blockchain would provide initial evidence to lower the cost of establishing ""matters of fact.""  Any new, blockchain-based governance system for the Belt and Road community will need a reliable, trusted jurisdictional home. And for that, we highlighted a key role for Hong Kong, with its access to the free and open Internet, its common law heritage, and a business credo of “public governance/private business.”  Thus we argued that resolving the ‘verifiability and validity’ issues could be addressed by developing open standards for online dispute resolution of blockchain identifiers under Hong Kong law, with legal certainty provided by its Electronic Transactions ordinance (Cap 553).  We adopted an open, bottom-up, opt-in approach inspired by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which successfully managed a similar global policy endeavor for domain names.  Other standards will also need to emerge in related industries to ensure all parties have confidence in the data being shared in a blockchain environment.  Of particular value was the foundation last year of the Global Smart Container Alliance in Shenzhen to drive standards both for smart shipping containers that record and report the ambient state of their cargo and for “E-locks,” which are used to electronically seal the container for faster customs and duty clearance.  Since March 2016, E-locks have been successfully used between the customs authorities of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China’s Silicon Valley. By combining legal certainty with cryptographic certainty, the Belt and Road Blockchain will not prevent trade disputes from occurring – they will – but when they do the cost and complexity of having them will be dramatically reduced. And that’s good for business.  Toward 'pull' demand chains  One exciting, highly disruptive outcome of blockchain integration into global manufacturing and trade is the prospect that businesses will move from “push” supply chains to “pull” demand chains.  This is the idea that production will be configured in response to – or pulled by – customer demand rather than pre-configured on anticipation of what customers want and then pushed onto them. More than anything, it is going to make trade spats like that of the U.S. and China redundant.  Blockchains’ role in this is to help market participants break up long value chains into shorter ones, with financial exchanges acting as bridges between them. This should result in greater liquidity and enhanced price and market discovery.  I call this “packetizing risk” as the system can automatically dispense fine-grained rewards that can be traced back to the original rights holder based on the presence of appropriate cryptographic evidence.  A model like this could, for example, have allowed businesses waiting on the delivery of goods trapped on the creditor-seized ships of the bankrupt Hanjin Shipping Company in 2016 to liquidate their positions by selling tokenized rights to those immobilized goods.  It’s a demonstration of how finance can be unfrozen at intermediate stages along the chain, breaking them up, and facilitating more flexible and efficient means of aggregating the kinds of suppliers that operate in the ‘pull-based’ Demand Chains used in e-commerce.  Demand chains optimize “made-to-order” manufacturing, and customer fulfillment, to maximize product “variety not volume.” To get an idea of how this alters the current logic of trade rules, imagine we are fully immersed in the era of 3D-printing and IoT-driven manufacturing and a footwear maker gets a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a batch of customized cleats for Brazil’s national soccer team that must be rushed in time for next month’s World Cup. The cleats might be “Designed In China” – the home of the intellectual property – but “Made in Brazil” by a trustworthy 3D printer somewhere in Rio to produce the product and fulfill this order.  Demand chains are particularly useful when accurate sales forecasts are unavailable and demand is variable. Unfortunately, they are fragile; any unexpected supply disruption risks stopping the whole manufacturing process, leading to dreaded ""stock-outs.""  By packetizing risk and increasing a pool of potential KYM-ed suppliers, blockchain may finally enable demand chains to scale beyond their traditional trust limits and challenge traditional long-standing trust relationships.  Demand chains exploit that fact that digital trade dramatically changes cost equations and economics. A key reason why e-commerce thrives is because it is relatively inexpensive to stock digital bits on computers compared with stocking analog atoms in warehouses.  As such, it makes sense to offer an overwhelming variety of products. The assumption is that any logistic complexity can be managed through computerized automation, throwing in more computers and software as needed to scale. More importantly, products offered can be “pulled” into production only after they have been sold.  There are several commercial benefits to this approach. For suppliers, there’s an immediate gain in that they get the money up front. Secondly, because they now know real-time sales demand, they avoid the common “bullwhip effect” problem encountered in traditional “made-to-stock” supply chains. This occurs when errors in forecasting demand are amplified up the supply chain, leading to increased waste the higher upstream you go. With demand chains, suppliers see “effective demand,” not forecasted demand.  One can view demand chains with packetized risk as an evolution of “just-in-time” manufacturing, as they add in the important element of automated “just-in-time” financing. This wouldn’t be possible without a blockchain, since it can automatically reward participants without the risk of funds being stolen or unduly withheld.  Another potential benefit: saving the environment. This stems from a rather non-obvious feature of “pull” demand chains and the exchange markets that power them: the concept of “reverse logistics,” which covers all operations involved in the return or reuse of products and materials.  One might create an exchange for a product’s reuse, recycling or upcycling. Doing so might incentivize the creation of the “circular economy,” greatly improving the resource usage with potentially huge environmental benefits. In this model, products are not optimally priced for the point of sale, but for one step beyond the sale -- the point of reuse.  Taking this idea further, manufacturers might be encouraged to make a market in their own products where it is cheaper to design a product for durability, and buy it back, rather than design for planned obsolescence that externalize the environmental costs.  Since 2017, the Europeans have had a bold plan to kill “planned obsolescence” and encourage products that are end-user serviceable. A blockchain-based model of demand chains, with the added kicker of tokenized incentives, could help them get there.  Trade = IP exchange  Cryptocurrency exchanges, which now cover more than 10,000 unique digital assets, can be thought of as providing a market mechanism for pricing intangible property (IP). (Note: I am deliberately applying the acronym “IP” to a wider definition of assets beyond “intellectual property” since most cryptocurrency technology is based on open-source software).  We now have an opportunity to extend this approach to on-demand Industry 4.0 manufacturing technologies such as 3D-printing. Here, the only element that is “shipped” is a digital design, whose provenance can be tracked to the original author of the work using a blockchain (e.g. ascribe.io).  A blockchain might also act as a market, one that functions like an efficient collecting society since the monetization event occurs long after the original creation was made. With a blockchain, we can now trace and cascade back any royalties to the appropriate beneficiaries, forging a powerful new way to reward the creative process. MIT researcher Prema Shrikrishna calls this “IP over IP” (Intellectual Property over the Internet Protocol), where manufacturing “supply” moves adjacent to market “demand.”  Thus the very nature of trade changes from shipping tangible property in containers (atoms) to intangible property in packets (bits). This has huge ramifications for the international trade policy regime.  It’s unclear how the existing trade rules under the World Trade Organisation’s Rules of Origin will apply in such cases or whether countries will strategically hoard raw materials such as rare earth elements.  Given the glacial rate of WTO negotiation rounds, measured in multiple years, it is hard to see how the existing regulatory regime will adapt to a world where manufacturing, trade and retail are “all digital,” even less so to a world where smart containers and packages automatically route themselves to their most profitable market.  This emerging paradigm suggests that divergences in manufacturing processes and costs – and the nation-state-led trade wars they trigger – will have decreasing economic relevance, relative to the impact of digital innovation. Already the root cause of labor disruption worldwide, digital automation will have an accelerating impact on people’s lives and livelihoods.  The real danger for policymakers lies in not recognizing when a technical innovation is fundamentally changing the underlying architectural assumptions, and brings with it changes in market structure and competitive landscape. Rarely does a bell ring to tell you it’s underway. That’s what the onset of blockchain technology portends. Governments must have their eyes and ears open.  As for the immediate future, there is certainly a risk of a US-China trade war, with Hong Kong possibly caught in any crossfire. Yet there is also an opportunity for leadership and for a grand bargain between the world’s two great trading powers to identify a common interest in establishing new rules for trading in Intangible Property using a global blockchain-based trade architecture.  Of the two outcomes, it’s clear to me that a trade war is not only powerless in the face of a dramatically changing economic architecture but even more dangerous than ever to common wellbeing.

The Office of the Colorado Secretary of State published a new working draft of its ""Rules Concerning Campaign and Political Finance"" on Wednesday, which notably includes a new section on cryptocurrency donations.  The document, which updates the Code of Colorado Regulations, does not specify any particular cryptocurrencies in the new rule, but does allow for market volatility and includes certain restrictions.  The proposed guidance states:  ""A committee may accept contributions in cryptocurrency, up to the acceptable limit for a cash or coin contribution. The amount of the contribution is the value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the contribution. The committee must report any gain or loss after the contribution as other income or receipts.""  Further sections note that anonymous contributions must be below $20, with contributions at or above that level being donated to a charitable organization or the state treasurer.  No maximum limit is specified in the document for contributions from identified donors, instead referring to supplementary documentation. According to the Secretary of State's website, this limit can range from $200 to no prohibition, depending on the position for which a candidate is running.  Residents of Colorado can provide feedback to the secretary's office on the draft until 5:00 p.m. local time on May 23. If approved, Colorado would become the latest state to allow cryptocurrency donations for this purpose.  The Federal Election Commission – which oversees national-level campaigns – previously announced it would allow bitcoin donations to political campaigns, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

Subsequently, bitcoin gained more than $500 over the weekend, rising back above resistance at the 50-day moving average.  At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at around $8,530, having clocked a six-day high of $8,644 earlier today.  While last week's bearish trend seems to have run out of steam (as seen in the charts below), the weekend's low-volume rally risks trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market.  4-hour chart        The inverse head-and-shoulders breakout indicates short-term bullish trend reversal – i.e. the pullback from the high of $9,990 has ended and the breakout has opened the doors to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows yesterday's candle closed (as per UTC) above Saturday's doji candle high of $8,468, signaling a bullish reversal. Further, the 5-day and 10-day moving averages have shed bearish bias (are no longer sloping downwards).  As a result, the probability that bitcoin will rally to $9,000 this week is high. However, the bullish case significantly weakens if we take into account the figures for trading volume.  Volume is an important indicator, as it shows the level of interest in bitcoin. A rally backed by high volumes means greater reliance can be placed on the bullish move. Conversely, a low volume rally trends to end up being a bull trap.  In BTC's case, currently, trading volume on Bitfinex continues to decline and more importantly remained low alongside positive price action, as seen in the chart above. Further, trading volume across all exchanges fell below $5 billion over the weekend – the lowest level since April 11, according to CoinMarketCap.  Thus, the sustainability of the rally seen over the weekend is under question.  View  BTC rally lacks substance (low volumes), hence the outlook is likely neutral, despite the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout (4-hour chart) and the bullish doji reversal (daily chart).  A failure to hold above $8,475 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) would revive the bearish view and allow a drop to Friday's low of $7,925.  On the higher side, only a high volume move above the 100-day moving average, currently seen at $8,857, would open the doors to $10,000.

42401554,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd01MS,1526889606,China's IT Ministry: 2017 Saw 'Exponential' Blockchain Growth,"Nearly 40 percent of all Chinese blockchain startups emerged in 2017 alone, according to a new white paper published by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  Revealed  by the ministry's Information Center on Monday, the blockchain industry paper indicates that currently China has 456 startups that focus on blockchain technology development and applications as part of their core business. While the number of new blockchain firms in 2016 had tripled compared to that in 2015, 2017 saw ""exponential"" growth, it says, with a total of 178 newcomers to the space.  Meanwhile, corresponding to that trend, similar momentum was also seen in equity financing for blockchain startups. According to the government data, currently there are 249 equity financing initiatives that directly relate to blockchain startups, and nearly 100 of them got started in 2017.  That number marks more than the total recorded from 2014 to 2016, the paper says, and also notably, the industry has already seen 68 equity financing initiatives for blockchain startups in the first quarter of 2018.  Published as a comprehensive summary of the blockchain outlook in China, the 157-page white paper marks the latest effort by the Chinese government to bring knowledge of the nascent technology to the public, and shed light on future development – especially regarding regulatory frameworks.  While reiterating the importance of maintaining the ban on initial coin offerings, the ministry also argues in the paper that China's current patent law – completed a decade ago – may already be outdated when it comes to protecting intellectual properties for blockchain technologies.  For example, as explained in the paper, the patent law in China now only seeks to protect those technology use cases that can be specifically outlined by patent applicants.  ""But blockchain is an underlying technology that has a wide range of application scenarios. It is both difficult and expensive to require patent applicants to list all potential and specific use cases in order to gain intellectual property protections,"" the paper wrote, adding:  ""If we want to protect blockchain technology IPs, then we have to to make certain adjustments to how the patent law is being practiced.""

42401560,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd01SM,1526886041,Crypto Tribalism Is Holding Back Blockchain,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.          The inaugural 2015 event’s 500 attendees were dominated by true believers in bitcoin, along with its subversive goal of replacing fiat currency and traditional banking – though, with Citibank as a sponsor and many bankers present, the conference was also a modest blockchain baptism for the financial establishment.    By contrast, last week’s fourth installment boasted 7,500 attendees, from 104 different countries and captures a full cross-section of the economy that includes everyone from automobile makers and insurance companies to government agencies and even a fast food chain.      Expansion has come at the cost of cohesiveness. This big-tent community is gripped with internal divisions that are both baffling and off-putting to outsiders.      “Permissionless” cryptocurrency purists accuse established enterprises of co-opting the technology to produce watered down blockchain models that protect their incumbency. For their part, the enterprises critique the early adopters as naïve idealists whose complex solutions are impractical in the real world.      Further, within the purist crypto sub-community itself, there are internecine battles among proponents of different visions of bitcoin while fierce competition rages between so-called “altcoins,” whether ethereum, XRP, EOS or hundreds more.      Accusations of scams and personal attacks against different developers are rife on “crypto Twitter,” a social media setting that’s now synonymous with derision, bitterness and ad hominem attacks.      This conflict is unavoidable. It’s even helpful, to the extent that it compels developers to improve their projects’ code.      But with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators considering a more draconian stance against cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, a more united front among all who believe in this technology’s sweeping potential could help ensure a more constructive legal environment for its development.      Not everyone will want in on this. Purists who were prominent in bitcoin’s early development rightly point out that cryptocurrency’s DNA is geared toward resisting regulation. “Bring it on,” they say, viewing bitcoin, monero and other cryptocurrencies primarily as safe havens for their wealth and less as societal tools for building a disintermediated, frictionless economy.      But they are now in a minority. Those who’ve swelled the ranks of the community tend to focus on the great potential for humanity generally across multiple use cases and believe that achieving it requires accommodation with policymakers, regulators, and a wary general public.      There’s quite a chasm between those views, one that comes down to how each approaches the question of trust.      Libertarian crypto hardliners strive for a “trustless” ideal, the notion that managing one’s own assets and exchanging value with others should not require trusting any third-party person, institution, machine or software program.      By contrast, most others, including many of the community’s newcomers, see this technology as a way to enhance trust, not replace it. Their idea is that if an immutable blockchain ledger can overcome mistrust in the record of money and data transactions, people will have a more reliable foundation, a shared record of the truth, upon which to forge the human bonds needed to write the necessary “off-chain” business contracts that put those transactions in motion.    ‘Trustless’ is impossible    Although I strongly believe in the disintermediating power of bitcoin and in the ideal of decentralization, I see total trustlessness as an unattainable ideal, at least not for the world I want to live in. I don’t want the only sense of security for my private property to be a gun that I’d never want to use.      Crypto hardliners will call this position naïve. Many have embraced the mantra “Don’t trust, verify,” but I prefer Ronald Reagan’s original formulation: “Trust, but verify.”      Trust is unavoidable if we are to thrive. The more willing and open people are to exchanges of value, the better off we are. Economics is not a zero-sum game. Wealth is created, it is not taken – now, more than ever, in a digital economy in which collaboration and network effects are fostering exponential growth for organizations that can master them. For people to form those networks and enter into an exchange with each other requires trust.      If the many non-cryptocurrency use cases for blockchains, such as supply chain and Internet of Things applications, are to succeed, we’re going to have to devise workable, off-chain trust arrangements by which people and machines input data. Purists will argue that most of them are impossible because of this “last mile” problem. But that problem exists with or without a blockchain.      Surely by improving the record-keeping layer, removing the prospect of double-spent transactions and creating an immutable chain of provenance for each piece of input data, we are taking a step forward from the current scenario when neither layer is fully reliable.    Code is not law    The critics’ counterpoint is that the immutability and append-only nature of blockchains create a “garbage in/garbage out” problem that doesn’t exist with traditional, editable databases, which can be reversed if an error is found.      But if the parties to a transaction either voluntarily agree or are compelled to reverse a prior transaction, a blockchain’s “garbage” can, in effect, be removed. This points to the need to properly install that most important of human trust systems: the web of laws and self-regulating rules that bind contracting parties to their commitments.      It’s vital that standards, governance models and, most importantly, supportive legal frameworks are allowed to develop for blockchain technology. (This does not necessarily mean changing laws. Often it will be better to seek clear, unambiguous interpretations of how existing laws apply to blockchain models and in ways that don’t make them unworkable.)      Investors in The DAO learned the hard way that there is no escape from relying on the law. That notorious, ethereum-based investment fund’s fatal flaw was not so much that the code underpinning its smart contract inevitably contained a bug but that the terms and conditions held out that the functioning of the code could not be superseded by any law.      The attacker or attackers who drained $50 million from the fund could, under those conditions, argue they had acted entirely legally, that they were exploiting a feature of the software, not a bug. The DAO’s rigid “code is law” position was not tenable when investors began demanding retribution and persuaded the ethereum core developers to institute a contentious fork to recover those funds.      The technology needs more than technical development for it to achieve broad global impact; there’s also a crying need for social infrastructure that establishes a formal and informal system of governance within which it can operate.      It’s exactly the kind of thing that the wide group of people who attended this week’s Consensus conference should be setting their minds to.

42401555,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd01NR,1526871335,3 Ways Blockchain Is Already Delivering on the Hype,"Balaji S. Srinivasan is the CTO of Coinbase, a Board Partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a member of CoinDesk's advisory board.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed exclusively to attendees of CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 event.      In Monty Python's ""Life of Brian,"" there's afamous scene in which John Cleese's character is stirring up a group against the Romans.  He's trying to get them all frothed up about the supposed righteousness of their cause and the uselessness of the Romans, until reality intrudes. One by one, members of the crowd begin listing off all the things the Romans actually have brought to the community, from roads to medicine to sanitation, thereby contradicting his criticism and undermining his point.  I'm reminded of this scene when surveying much of today's commentary on blockchain technology.  There's no dearth of intelligent and thoughtful people claiming that theblockchain is bad, or that it has no use, or that it's bad andhas no use.  It's an odd situation, because while businesses in the blockchain sector are already empirically generatingbillions of dollars in revenue, thevalue of digital currencies and assets is often said to be driven largely byspeculation on future rather than present utility.  But even if we grant this claim for the sake of argument, stating that most of the value of blockchain lies in the future is not the same as saying that (a) the present-day utility of the blockchain is zero or that (b) the blockchain sector will never live up to its valuation.  In this piece, we review some of the reasons why new technologies like the blockchain are often heavily criticized en route to ubiquity. We then discuss the specifics of how the blockchain has already begun disrupting at least three multibillion dollar verticals: thegoldindustry,internationalwiretransfers andcrowdfunding.  Finally, we talk through a few objections, and conclude by discussing the areas where the blockchain may provide yet more near-term 10X advantages.  Fad, bubble, monopoly  Highly valuable technologies typically experience relentless negativity on the way to the summit.  High growth is matched by high volatility and even higher expectations, leading to hypecycles and periods of apparent overvaluation until eventually the technology is globally ubiquitous. Then the new critique is no longer about faddishness or lack of utility but about inescapable monopoly, until the next disruption appears on the horizon and the cycle begins anew.  One example of this with the earlier internet revolution can be seen by comparing IT Doesn't Matter (published in the trough of the dot-com bubble in 2003) to The Shallows (written after social media and web 2.0 had re-emerged and proven themselves in 2011).  The first book argued that software was no longer a source of competitive advantage and that the internet revolution had been overhyped. The second book, by the very same author, argued that software companies were now too successful and the internet revolution was causing a fundamental shift in society. While the theses were mutually contradictory, the one common thread was unremitting negativity toward the then-new technology called the internet.  Another more recent example is with Facebook and social media.  Despite piling up 500 million users in six years, in 2010 people were still calling the company a bubble that would never live up to the outlandish $33 billion valuation that people had placed on it. This narrative stillheld as late as August 2012, as Facebook's stock plummeted after the IPO and it was an open question as to whether they'd be able tomonetize on mobile. By 2017, of course, Facebookmade $15 billion in net income in just one year.  Now the questions of whether social media is a fad or Facebook is overvalued have silently faded away. The new question is whether Facebook is an unstoppable monopoly that requires government regulation. This may be a legitimate question; however, it is a wholly different one from the contention that social media was a mere trifle or passing fad.  The blockchain is already midway through a similar path. Lest we forget, bitcoin was initially dismissed as something that couldneverwork due to its deflationary mining schedule. Decade-old macroeconomic textbooks were quoted like holy scripture, as if ""Econ 101"" was relevant to Nakamoto Consensus and the solution of the Byzantine Generals Problem. Tulips were waved like cloves of garlic. Endlessprocessions of the prominent were trotted out to denounce the heresy.  Hundreds  of obituaries and dozens of ""bans"" later, of course, bitcoin is now worth many billions of dollars. It hasn't just survived but has thrived, and has given rise to ethereum and dozens of other coins and chains.  But it's far too early to declare victory.  No longer dismissed as a passing fad, and not yet attacked as a dominant monopoly, today's argument against the blockchain sector is that it's a bubble without real use. After all, the blockchain space as a whole is worth hundreds of billions of dollars, but where is the utility? What are the daily use cases? What justifies this value? Why is it not just a bubble now and forevermore?  10x advancements  So let's talk about the successes of the blockchain to date, as those often go without saying. There are at least three multibillion dollar sectors where the blockchain has provided quantifiable 10X improvements over the preceding technologies. These are digital gold, international wire transfers, and crowdfunding.  First and perhaps most obviously, bitcoin is a better gold.  Wences Casares of Xapo gave the canonical presentation on this several years ago. Being digital, bitcoin is infinitely lighter than gold of the same value. Large amounts of money can be quickly transported across borders, easily10X faster than the equivalent amount of gold can be moved. And bitcoin is significantly more divisible and liquid than a gold bar.  Even given bitcoin's recent issues with transaction fees and wait times (already partially obviated viaLightning), the technical advantages vis-a-vis gold are obvious and at this point well-nigh indisputable. The gradual replacement of gold by bitcoin onmanybalancesheets and in a wide variety offinancial contexts is now just a matter of time and institutional inertia.  Given that the total value of gold is estimated to range into thetrillions of dollars, scaling the digital gold application alone can justify the total market cap of the blockchain sector.  Second, consider international wire transfers.  If two startups or contractors on either side of the world want to transact and if both parties are aware of cryptocurrency, ethereum is increasingly their medium of choice. The reasons for this low-profile revolution in global money transmission are simple: ethereum settles in roughly14 seconds, works 24/7 in any country, allows instantaneous generation of receiving addresses, and is now fairly well known in the tech community. Thus, if you can email someone, you can send them $50,000 in ethereum about as quickly and easily as you can send them an attachment.  This allows medium-scale international deals to close in real time. The vendor emails over an ethereum address, and the customer Docusigns a contract and sends the ethereum. Receipt is confirmed over the phone as both parties hit refresh onEtherscan. The sheer speed of the transaction increases the velocity of business and the trust between geographically distributed partners. Forget same-day transfer; this is same-minute transfer.  We've personally seen this exact use case many times. While it's not obvious how many people are using ethereum in this way, it is obvious that it's far better than wires for those that are. To gauge how widespread this use case is, we spoke to Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain for this article, who noted that ""a significant fraction of our tens of millions of users are using the Blockchain Wallet to enable large, fast cross-border transactions. We may publish statistics on this in the future.""  In theory, this use case will soon face competition from banks, who will adoptSWIFT gpi and bring settlement times down. But in practice, international wires still takemultiple business days to clear while ethereum reliably clears within seconds — and has for years. Ethereum also saves both parties a trip to the bank during business hours, as ETH transactions can be sent between any pair of devices at any time of day.  In this case, the real world utility of a blockchain-based technology has actually been underhyped. It is already 10X faster than SWIFT, and has been for some time.  As a third example of what the blockchain has already done for us, consider crowdfunding. Most folks in tech know ofKickstarter,Indiegogo andGoFundMe. But when considered internationally, the sector is even bigger than you might think. It was estimated to be in thebillions annually andgrowingfast even before January 2017. And then came the year of ICOs and token sales.  With almost $9 billion worth of token sales and ICOs consummated within the span of about a year, we have entered a completely new age for crowdfunding. To put this in perspective, just three years ago ethereum itself raised about$15 million in whatwas thenone of thelargest crowdfunders of all time. But the advent of ICOs and token sales completely demolished all previous records. As with gold and international wire transfers, the use of blockchain technology empirically introduced a 10X improvement, allowing international crowdfunders on the scale ofhundreds of millions of dollars to occur for the first time. And thanks to the blockchain, tens of millions of dollars from all around the world could now be sent and settled within30 seconds.  Please note: remarking on these totals is meant to offer neither praise nor criticism of the specific projects which have raised these funds. It is simply important to note that blockchain-driven improvements in crowdfunding technology have enabled financings of an unprecedented scale and speed, literally 10X larger and faster than what came before. And while many regulatory issues still need to be worked out to fully mainstream ICOs and token sales, it is quite possible that the blockchain will go on to transform not just crowdfunding, butventure capital itself.  Flaws are fixable  The three application areas outlined above — digital gold, international wire transfer, and crowdfunding — demonstrate that blockchain-driven 10X innovation is already here.  The remaining obstacles are related to execution and distribution. The fundamentalzero-to-one innovation in these areas is no longer in question and has been obvious to people in the space for years.  One counterargument is that these 10X improvements may indeed exist, but not everyone can yet avail themselves of them.  Note, however, that this is a significant step back from the claim that ""nobody has come up with a use case for blockchain after 10 years,"" as the number of parties that can benefit from these three use cases includes every entity with gold on the balance sheet, every business with transnational trade, and every organization raising money online.  While scaling the blockchain-driven 10X advantages out to all these entities will doubtless take some time, it will also reliably generate billions in value.  Another counterargument is that the new technologies are not superior in all respects.  What about bitcoin's volatility? What about the fact that everyone doesn't yet accept ethereum in lieu of a bank-based wire transfer? And what about the regulatory issues surrounding crypto crowdfunding?  Each of these is a legitimate objection, for which we can furnish an answer.  To address volatility we need companies to sell the traditional instruments for managing volatility, likecollars. To get more folks to accept crypto as a means for international wire transfer means gettingmoreusers for exchanges on both sides. And to address the regulatory issues surrounding ICOs and crypto-crowdfunding, we'll have to spend time with policy makers andheads of state.  But these kinds of objections miss the forest for the trees. A new technology is typically not mildly superior to an existing technology in every respect but is instead 10X better on one key axis. That 10X improvement draws customers and provides the capital and rationale for fixing the other defects.  The early iPhone camera is a good case in point — while far worse than a dedicated digital camera in most respects, it had one 10X advantage going for it: its ubiquity as abundled piece of a network-connected smartphone. That led to arapid rise in use and a concomitant rapid investment in the feature set of network-connected, phone-based cameras.  We're seeing a similar phenomenon with blockchain-based technologies, where their 10X advantages mean they are gaining ground despite their largely remediable flaws.  Conclusion  There is no dearth of articles on how theblockchainwilleventuallydisrupteverything. I actually believe we will see most of the envisioned use cases come to pass, though some will take years or decades to fully play out and will go through multiple iterations before succeeding. Over the next few years, I'm particularly bullish on ethereum games and blockchain-basedsocial networks andmarketplaces.  But that long-term bullishness comes from an empirical reckoning with the concrete successes that the blockchain has put on the board to date.  It is only because the blockchain has already done so much for us that I expect it to do so much more.
