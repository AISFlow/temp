Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Prices Fall After Rate Hike  By James Rubin  The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates a widely anticipated 75 basis points for the fourth consecutive time.  Ether, dogecoin and other major altcoins didn't like the sound of that, and tumbled well into the red Wednesday afternoon.  Bitcoin fell more moderately.  ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading a few fractions above $1,500, down more than 4% over the past 24 hours but right around its perch of the past week. DOGE was recently down about 10%, returning some of its recent, dramatic gains. The popular meme token was still trading above 12 cents, near its highest point in more than six months.  Meanwhile, BTC continued to hover over its most recent $20,000 support line, down 1.8% from Tuesday, same time, despite rising investor interest. CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams noted on Wednesday that the crypto winter had given bullish investors an opportunity to accumulate bitcoin at a favorable cost basis. ""Larger crypto investors are continuing to explore this opportunity,"" Williams wrote, adding: ""Whether asset managers are picking the right price point to go long will play out over the next 12 months, but they appear to be ahead of the curve.""  The CoinDesk Market Index declined about 2.5%.  Meanwhile, major equity markets plunged following the Fed’s announcement, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off 3.3% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) off 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively. Investors remain concerned about the central bank’s strategy to combat rising prices, and the prospect of a harsh recession. Safe haven gold sank 0.7%.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Nischal Shetty, co-founder of Indian crypto exchange WazirX, said he ""wouldn't be surprised if we see downward pressure on prices,"" although he was upbeat about bitcoin's recent tenacity. ""Bitcoin seems to be holding strong at $20,000; that's an important point,"" he said.  Insights  Arbitrum Is More Than Hype, According to On-Chain Data  By Shaurya Malwa  Crypto traders and investors are increasingly seeing the Arbitrum ecosystem as a likely spot for capturing returns along the lines of the 100-times-plus multiples sometimes witnessed in prior bull-market cycles.  The Ethereum-based scaling product, which allows traders to transact on the blockchain network for under a few cents in fees and transacting times of a few seconds, is among a flurry of blockchain networks that launched in the past year – each promising to be faster and cheaper than the previous one.  On-chain data shows Arbitrum is not all hype. Since August, weekly transactions on Arbitrum have skyrocketed over 550%, with the Arbitrum network now commanding more than 62% of the weekly transactions on Ethereum.  The total value locked (TVL) on Arbitrum has increased by over $400 million in the past few months, data from DeFiLlama shows, with the ecosystem now holding over $1 billion. Popular trading tool GMX accounts for 43% of all this TVL.  Weekly active users on Arbitrum have also spiked in the past two weeks, analysts at research firm Delphi Digital said in a report this week.  “Since Oct. 10, weekly active users have grown 125% to reach a new all-time high of 282K, even surpassing numbers recorded during the Arbitrum Odyssey event,” they said, referring to a week-long initiative held in July meant for users to explore the Arbitrum ecosystem with exclusive non-fungible tokens (NFT) as rewards.  Delphi analysts added that much of the ongoing activity was also “likely from speculators trying to boost their on-chain activity in the hopes of receiving a larger airdrop.”  “Users could also be taking advantage of the various yield farming opportunities offered by protocols on Arbitrum,” they further added.  Arbitrum developers had not announced any tokens, or even plans for any tokens, as of Wednesday. But rumors and anticipation of a potential developer is sometimes all you need to excite degens in crypto land.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

42388769,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRSCWJ,1667428236,Instagram Users Will Soon Be Able to Mint and Sell NFTs,"Instagram said that starting this week it will begin allowing a select group of digital creators to mint and sell non-fungible tokens (NFT) directly from the social media platform.  The image-focused app recently launched its Digital Collectibles feature in 100 countries, allowing users to connect to their digital wallets and showcase NFTs that they either created or bought. The connected NFTs can be shown in your feed and include a shimmery effect to indicate authenticity.  The latest update will allow creators to make their own digital collectibles and sell them both on and off Instagram, giving them an ""end-to-end toolkit"" for creating, displaying and selling NFTs. It will initially launch on the Polygon blockchain and will be tested among a small group of creators in the U.S., including Amber Vittoria, Refik Anadol, Jason Seife, Dave Krugman and several others.  “This move represents a remarkable milestone in the evolution of Instagram’s existing NFT functionality and a natural next step to bring Web3 to the mainstream,” said Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.  Instagram will also allow video-based digital collectibles to be shown on its platform and will add support for the Solana blockchain and Phantom wallet. Prior to this, the platform supported Ethereum, Polygon and Flow blockchains, as well as connections to third-party wallets including Rainbow, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet and Dapper Wallet.  Meta noted that it will not charge fees for displaying and sharing a digital collectible on Instagram or Facebook and it will not charge any additional fees for selling digital collectibles until at least 2024. It added, however, that ""digital collectible purchases made within the Instagram app on the Android and iOS operating systems are subject to applicable app store fees.""  In addition, it pledged that neither creators nor collectors will need to pay gas fees for digital collectibles bought on Instagram at launch.  In a step-by-step video of the new feature viewed by CoinDesk, it appears that NFT creators will also be able to choose their royalty percentage between 5% to 25%. Creators can then link their bank account or PayPal account to get paid.

Asset-light Marathon, which works with hosting firms and doesn't own the infrastructure behind its mining machines, has had a tough few months.  Most of its hashrate was knocked offline by a June storm in Montana. Its hosting partner Compute North, one of the largest in the U.S., filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September, unsettling the market about Marathon's deployment prospects.  Despite these headwinds, Marathon energized 32,000 machines during October, increasing its hashrate by 84%. The miner's computing power is now 7 exahash/second (EH/s), the press release said, making it one of the world's largest miners.  The bitcoin mined in October almost matches the 616 it mined for the entire third quarter.  The rest of Marathon's hashrate is supposed to come online by mid-2023 through a 200 megwatt (MW) hosting deal with Applied Blockchain (APLD), an additional 42 MW with troubled Compute North and 12 MW with undisclosed firms. The miner didn't provide updates as to the progress of these projects.

Bitcoin shrugged. Ether fell.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at roughly $20,200, down 1.3% over the past 24 hours after rising earlier in the day. As CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams wrote earlier in the day, the crypto winter has given bullish investors the opportunity to accumulate at a favorable cost basis. Larger crypto investors are continuing to explore this opportunity.  ""Whether asset managers are picking the right price point to go long will play out over the next 12 months, but they appear to be ahead of the curve,"" Williams wrote.  Ether, the second-largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at about $1,510, down more than 4% following the Fed’s decision to continue its months-long, monetary hawkishness.  The CoinDesk Market Index declined about 2%. Even dogecoin (DOGE), the biggest gainer among altcoins over the past week, plunged almost 10%. CRO was among the exceptions, recently rising more than 6.7%.  Meanwhile, major equity markets plunged following the Fed’s announcement, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off 3.3% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) off 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively. Investors remain concerned about the central bank’s strategy to combat rising prices, and the prospect of a harsh recession. Safe haven gold sank 0.7%.

Technical Take  BTC Markets Entering a New Phase in Potential Accumulation Season  By Glenn Williams Jr  Bitcoin and ether’s significant decline in recent months is providing bullish investors the opportunity to accumulate at a favorable cost basis. Larger crypto investors are continuing to explore this opportunity.  Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range for nearly five months, with support at about $19,000 a good portion of the time. Ether has dipped as low as $1,000 but has mostly hovered around $1,300 over the same period. Now, both have stepped up a rung, with support above $20,000, and $1,500, respectively.  The increases come amid a fourth consecutive 75 basis point interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in the Federal Reserve's fierce battle to stem inflation without throwing the U.S. economy into a steep recession. Crypto markets have largely responded to the central bank’s monetary gyrations and other macroeconomic events, usually rising with encouraging news and dipping when investors are more pessimistic.

42411697,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfJSs,1667424129,SWIFT Is Partnering With Chainlink: Here’s the Down-low on the Blockchain Data Provider,"SWIFT and Chainlink’s “love story” began years ago when Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink’s co-founder, won its blockchain start-up competition.  “You were actually one of the first startups that we bet on,” Strategy Director Jonathan Ehrenfeld Solé of SWIFT, which executes financial transactions and payments between banks worldwide, told Nazarov at this year's SmartCon. Now their partnership could ensure that blockchain becomes an integral part of the financial system.  Chainlink announced recently it is helping Belgium-based SWIFT make token transfers and communicate across all blockchain environments.  “That'll accelerate the adoption of DLT [distributed ledger technology] blockchains and benefit various institutions all over the capital markets,"" Nazarov said at the conference.  So what is this significant protocol all about?  Read more: SWIFT Partners With Crypto Data Provider Chainlink on Cross-Chain Protocol in TradFi Play  What is Chainlink?  The protocol’s mission is to help enable the creation of innovative smart contracts and decentralized, peer-to-peer applications that can be used by different types of enterprises across the globe, plus improve the way people access blockchain technology. An example of this is its network of oracles that enable the decentralized Web3 ecosystem to access data sources like weather information.  Chainlink Labs was founded in 2014, under the name SmartContract.com, a blockchain technology startup. Steve Ellis, Ari Juels and Sergey Nazarov published a white paper on Chainlink in September 2017. Nazarov’s track record with crypto technology dates back to 2011.  Steve Ellis also co-founded a crypto company in 2014 called the Secure Asset Exchange, and was a software engineer before that. Meanwhile, Ari Juels is a faculty member at Cornell Tech in New York and co-director of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3). He is currently the chief scientist at Chainlink Labs.  Chainlink operates on Ethereum Virtual Machine-based (EVM) chains that can execute smart contracts such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche Mainnet and Fantom, Marc Arjoon, research associate at digital asset management firm CoinShares said in an interview with CoinDesk. It also supports non-EVM chains like Solana. Chainlink does not have its own blockchain.  What exactly is Chainlink doing with SWIFT?  Chainlink is working with SWIFT on a proof-of-concept (PoC), where it is exploring using the protocol's cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP) to help the interbank network communicate and transfer tokens across all blockchain environments. SWIFT is an interbank messaging system that connects to banks and enables cross-border payments.  The CCIP allows smart contracts, which are tools that can automatically execute functions after certain criteria is met, to communicate across multiple blockchains. Developers can easily build applications on top of it.  “So from SWIFT’s side, it becomes a lot more powerful because instead of just messaging, it can do settlements as well now, not directly but through the blockchain,” Arjoon said. Typically SWIFT just delivers the information from banks for example, while the banks handle the actual settlement.  Why would SWIFT partner with Chainlink?  Chainlink has 47% of the total value secured by all oracles, while the rest is distributed across competitors like WINKLink (17.45%). This made it the perfect candidate for a collaboration like this.  ""It's ... [partly] first mover's advantage ... they pioneered this space,"" Arjoon said of SWIFT. There is also “undeniable interest” in crypto from institutional investors, SWIFT’s Solé said at the conference.  SWIFT, an international cooperative owned by member financial institutions, is well positioned to lead the charge in putting more assets on-chain. Its partnership with Chainlink allows banks to test the waters with blockchain technology without triggering undue regulatory scrutiny.  “If banks wanted to interact with blockchains, without using SWIFT, without using Chainlink, that would take years and a lot of overhead costs and there's a lot of regulatory oversight,” Arjoon said. Whereas together they can combine their networks.  ""We connect to 11,000 banks, [Chainlink] connects to 15 blockchains,” Solé said at the conference. “Then you have these two infrastructures that are secure, that are reliable, that are scalable, that can actually work so that you can buy an asset wherever you want, and you can transact it in whatever country.”  What else does Chainlink do?  It provides data feeds. This enables companies to connect smart contracts with real world data such as asset prices and reserve balances.  For example, if Compound, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, wants to get the price of a token, it would contact Chainlink’s oracle. On the back end, different exchanges would submit data to the oracle and Chainlink would combine these messages, Arjoon said.  Chainlink has also developed a programmable token bridge built on the CCIP that enables developers to transfer tokens across blockchain networks. It has an automation service, a verifiable source of randomness for smart contract developers (like a random number generator), and a way to monitor reserves. It sets out where the protocol is going in its 2021 white paper.  LINK  Chainlink has its own coin, called LINK, an Ethereum token that drives Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.  The Chainlink network uses LINK to pay its node operators (run by people) a reward to retrieve data from off-chain data feeds and then delivering that data on-chain to the smart contract, its white paper said. You need LINK to pay for Chainlink’s services. Node operators are the entities that are responsible for running Chainlink's hardware and software and monitoring the network. They also watch out for incoming data requests from smart contracts.  Soon, Chainlink will upgrade so that LINK can be staked on its platform and rewards can be retrieved to help secure its oracle services. The project will be underway by December.

42388765,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRSCIH,1667423224,Lending Protocol TrueFi Issues Notice of Default to Invictus Capital for Failing to Repay Loan,"Decentralized lending protocol TrueFi issued a notice of default on Wednesday to failed crypto hedge fund Invictus Capital after it missed repaying a $1 million loan.  Invictus took out a $1 million uncollateralized loan from TrueFi’s Binance USD (BUSD) credit pool, which was due to mature on Oct. 30, according to data on TrueFi’s loan dashboard. The borrower secured the loan with its good financial standing and reputation but didn’t pledge any assets against it, complicating the recovery of losses and restitution to those who invested in the credit pool.  TrueFi said it tapped its default protection fund designed to compensate affected investors, cutting 10% of the platform’s governance token TRU locked up in staking.  New World Holding, Invictus’ parent company, entered into a court-advised liquidation process on the Cayman Islands this summer after it became insolvent due to the implosion of the Terra blockchain and crypto lender Celsius Network’s bankruptcy.  Following the loan default, Archblock (formerly TrustToken), which manages relations between lenders and borrowers on TrueFi, will join the liquidation process in an attempt to reclaim assets. At the time, when TrueFi originated the loan to Invictus, Archblock was the sole underwriter of the loan.  This is the second loan default within a month on the TrueFi platform after Blockwater missed payment on a $3 million debt in October, CoinDesk reported. Rival lending platform Maple also encountered a default on a $10 million loan.  “Collections on the New World Holdings and Blockwater loans will be handled by Archblock’s special servicing team on behalf of TrueFi,” Diana Bushard, general counsel at Archblock, told CoinDesk. “Archblock has engaged local counsel in both matters and is actively pursuing asset recovery to minimize their impact on TrueFi lenders.”  Recent defaults on loans without collateral demonstrated the inherent fragility of uncollateralized lending based on trust, according to Walter Teng, vice president of digital assets at research firm Fundstrat.

42420890,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZQz,1667421061,BTC Markets Entering a New Phase in Potential Accumulation Season,"Call the current crypto winter the season of accumulation.  Bitcoin and ether’s significant decline in recent months is providing bullish investors the opportunity to accumulate at a favorable cost basis. Larger crypto investors are continuing to explore this opportunity.  Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range for nearly five months, with support at about $19,000 a good portion of the time. Ether has dipped as low as $1,000 but has mostly hovered around $1,300 over the same period. Now, both have stepped up a rung, with support above $20,000, and $1,500, respectively.  The increases come amid a fourth consecutive 75 basis point interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in the Federal Reserve's fierce battle to stem inflation without throwing the U.S. economy into a steep recession. Crypto markets have largely responded to the central bank’s monetary gyrations and other macroeconomic events, usually rising with encouraging news and dipping when investors are more pessimistic. Such reactions are normal in asset markets of all stripes.  During the recent rate hikes, BTC’s average true range (ATR) has declined approximately 71%. ETH’s ATR has declined 52%.  Yet, the pattern has differed in one respect – BTC and ETH have displayed less volatility than traditional assets. Will that trend change? Will the latest robust interest rate hike on Wednesday jar markets?  In remarks following the Fed’s announcement, Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the bank’s months-long commitment to quell rising prices. But a Fed statement earlier in the day offered investors some hope that the present monetary hawkishness would end in the near future.  ""In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments,"" the FOMC said.  The dovish signals are likely to send BTC and ETH higher, breaking them from their recent staid mode.  And asset managers will then surely – and wisely – take advantage of this likely upturn. A recent Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed that asset managers have increased their long positions in BTC while reducing their short positions. Asset managers’ open interest in BTC is now 88% long and 12% short, up from 84% long the prior week.  As asset managers generally hold larger sums of deployable capital, they have the ability to sway market prices with their activities.

Robinhood announced in August that it was slashing its staff by 23%, or 780 people, to reduce costs amid a continuing decline in monthly active users (MAU). Earlier in the year, Robinhood had cut about 9% of its workforce.  In the third quarter, Robinhood’s MAUs fell to 12.1 million from 14 million in the second quarter and 15.9 million in the first quarter as “customers continued to navigate the volatile market environment,” the company said. The company’s MAUs peaked in the second quarter of 2021 at 21.3 million.  In September, Robinhood released the beta version of its Polygon-based Web3 wallet to 10,000 users. The company said users of the wallet would be able to trade over 20 cryptocurrencies without fees and also connect to decentralized apps and earn yield on assets.  On the company's earnings call with analysts, CEO Vlad Tenev said Robinhood has garnered positive feedback about its self-custodial Web3 wallet, and plans to roll out the product globally. ""We're excited that this will be our first product available to people all over the world,"" Tenev said.  He also noted that Robinhood continued to make more coins available for users to trade in the third quarter, including USDC, its first stablecoin.  Overall, for the third quarter Robinhood posted an adjusted loss of 20 cents a share, ahead of the consensus analyst estimate of a loss of 31 cents a share, according to FactSet, on revenues of $361 million, just shy of the analyst estimate of $362 million.  Shares of Robinhood were up 2.6% to $11.70 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Shares are down about 34% year to date.  Michael Bellusci contributed reporting to this story.

Zhao also noted that investing in banks is a smart strategy for Binance because when the crypto exchange works with a bank, Binance often winds up driving many new users to it, increasing the bank’s valuation.  Zhao has said in the past Binance has over $1 billion to spend on acquisitions, and he recently committed $500 million to help fund Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover of Twitter.

Of this total, $905,000 was scammed just on the mid-September day the Merge took place.  Jardine told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” the Merge, which took place in September, had “all the ingredients” a scammer would need to grab vast amounts of money.  “You had a big change that created uncertainty, a major blockchain that was undergoing the change [and] a lot of publicity surrounding the event itself,” Jardine said. “Those are the right [things] to bring people into the system and see scammers succeed.”  Read more: Most Crypto Scams on BNB Chain, Solidus Labs Says  The scammers' efforts closely reflected those of traditional trust trade scams, which falsely promise users a significant amount of money or tokens in exchange for investing a certain amount of crypto.  “It’s a classic scam setup,” Jardine said. “In this case, they [scammers] were capitalizing upon the branding of the Merge.”  According to the crypto compliance platform’s latest report, scammers “were able to take advantage of lack of understanding around the Merge to fleece unsuspecting users.”  Read more: What to Expect From Ethereum’s Next Big Upgrade  Jardine said that one way scammers did this was by telling victims that Ethereum’s upgrade would require its users to send in substantial amounts of money.  On Sept. 15, 2022, the day of the second-biggest blockchain’s long-awaited shift, scammers were able to grift over $905,000 worth of ether (ETH).  Moreover, Merge-related scams appeared to have been tied to specific areas and were focused on clusters of countries with the highest GDP rates. Jardine noted that it is likely scammers targeted users in “wealthier countries under the assumption they’d be more likely to invest more in the scam.”  Read more: Ethereum’s Layer 2 Rollups Reduce Costs, but the Risks Are Underappreciated  “We found [that countries] like Finland, Poland, Chile, Panama and Vietnam were among those that most heavily tilted toward Merge-related scams,” Jardine said.  If people “become more familiar with the ins and outs of the crypto environment ... they will learn about the sort of telltale warning signs that would say this is probably a scam [and] you should probably avoid it,” he added.  In short, he said, it's all about “caution in avoiding things that seem too good to be true.”  UPDATE (Nov. 2 19:45 UTC): Corrects spelling of Eric Jardine's last name.

42388748,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRSBJT,1667412153,"Federal Reserve Hikes Rates as Expected, Will Watch 'Lags' in Monetary Policy; Bitcoin Rises","The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point) to a range of 3.75% to 4 % in a move that was widely anticipated by market participants, including bitcoin (BTC) traders.  It's the fourth consecutive rate hike of that magnitude by the Fed, which has aggressively been moving to jack up borrowing costs to cool the economy and in turn help bring down the highest inflation rate in four decades. Consumer prices have been rising at a pace of 8% on a 12-month basis, more than four times the Fed's target.  “Ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,“ according to a statement from the Fed's monetary-policy panel, known as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  Crypto traders watch the Fed because the price of bitcoin often tracks U.S. stocks; the theory is that tighter monetary policy makes risky assets less attractive.  Bitcoin rose 1.3% in the moments after the announcement by the FOMC.  Further clues about the path ahead could come from Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.  “Inflation continues to be sticky and high so rate hikes will continue, but the pace of hiking is set to slow,” said Nick Hotz, vice president of research at Arca. “Any sign of the Fed easing up would be taken as very bullish short-term for digital assets.”  Recent comments by central bankers suggest that this month's rate hike could be the last at an increment of 75 basis points – three times as fast as the typical increment in prior economic cycles.  San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly, for example, warned last month that the Fed could push the economy into an “unforced downturn” if it raised rates too fast.  The FOMC's statement suggested that the officials will keep a close eye on how the economy and inflation are responding to the recent series of rate hikes.  ""In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments,"" according to the FOMC statement.  Even though inflation in the U.S. has slowed from a year ago in recent months, it is still rising on a monthly basis, adding pressure on the Fed to not back down from tightening monetary policy.  Officials are also still trying to avoid an ugly recession and ease the pain of investors who have been grappling with a volatile U.S. Treasury market and falling stock prices.  Crypto assets have also seen a big drop in price ever since inflation started reaching painful levels earlier this year.  With inflation still running at 8.1% it might be too soon for central bankers to reverse course, given that the goal is 2%.  It could also be dangerous, because it could weaken the U.S. dollar against other currencies. The strength of the dollar is part of the reason why the U.S. economy is seeing much lower inflation than other countries, such as those in the European Union.  Powell hints at slowdown  At a press conference following the announcement, Powell gave several hints that the Fed is considering slowing the pace of rate hikes in the near future.  ""At some point it will become appropriate to slow … and it may come as soon as the next meeting, or the one after that,” he said. ""It is likely we'll have a discussion about this at the next meeting.""  While slowing is a possibility, pausing isn't at this point, Powell reiterated. He stressed that he doesn't think that the Fed has overtightened and that it is “very premature” to discuss pausing and ""not a conversation to be had.""  The chair did, however, say that ""how high to raise rates is more important than the pace of tightening.""

42388759,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRSC4F,1667410470,OpenSea Rolls Out Two New NFT Theft Protection Features,"Leading non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea said Wednesday it is offering two new features to prevent theft on its platform.  The features, one to prevent NFT theft and the other to detect it, come as part of the company’s larger effort to reduce scams and exploits by bad actors within the industry.  “Trust and safety issues – specifically scams and theft – are some of the biggest barriers to broader NFT adoption today,” OpenSea said in a blog post. “Ultimately, the goal of this work is to help make the ecosystem safer by reducing the downstream sales of stolen items … and thus reduce the incentive for NFT theft in the first place.”  The platform’s new theft prevention feature will proactively scan URLs to prevent malicious links from appearing on fraudulent collection listings. These types of links have been a major problem in recent months, commonly used as “wallet drainers,” where a bad actor can trick a user to sign over control of their NFT wallet to drain funds or transfer digital collectibles.  The second theft protection feature they are testing will auto-detect and flag potentially stolen or suspiciously transferred NFTs and then bar them from being traded on the platform. OpenSea expects this feature to reduce the incentives for NFT theft by lowering the value of any stolen goods. The platform had previously flagged stolen NFTs with a warning sign but still allowed them to be traded. The new feature will bar any trades and mark the NFT as “under review” for seven days while the previous owners are contacted to confirm or deny if the sale was legitimate.  OpenSea says it’s working with other entities in the NFT space to reduce scams, though a company representative declined CoinDesk’s request for more information.  “We’re working closely with other marketplaces, wallet providers, analytics organizations, and others, to develop holistic scam detection and prevention systems. We look forward to sharing more on this front soon,” OpenSea said in the blog post.

42394109,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXlsT,1667408400,Analyzing What's Next for Europe's Markets in Crypto Assets Law,"The European Union is set to be the first major jurisdiction in the world to agree how to regulate the digital asset sector, via its Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA).  Under the recently agreed text, providers of crypto services – which means anything from trading to custody to fiat exchanges – will need a license and be monitored by a financial regulator from one of the EU’s member states (Germany’s BaFin, say). Issuers of stablecoins – crypto assets which claim to maintain their value against assets such as the euro – will be subject to a bunch of other rules to ensure they keep their promise; regulators want them to hold reserves to avoid another Terra-style debacle.  Broadly, the rules get tougher for stablecoins that are more widely used, and for those tied to foreign fiat; EU governments are worried about their own currencies losing influence. Issuers’ white papers also need to be fair, clear and honest – a legacy of the time when initial coin offerings were all the rage, and often turned out to be scams.  All that’s easier said than done. Just to apply for a license you already need to be an EU-based legal entity, such as a company or formal partnership – which already rules out many decentralized governance models. (Witness Binance, which for a long time declined to say where its headquarters is located, or even that it had one). In return for jumping through those hoops, crypto companies can serve the entire bloc, which numbers some 450 million people. Perhaps more importantly, even if imperfect, the rules should be clear, mitigating the risk of capricious or unpredictable enforcement seen in the U.S. and elsewhere. Broadly, the industry has welcomed the new law, despite concerns that a cap on the use of dollar stablecoins could inhibit trading.  EU lawmakers such as Ondřej Kovařík may have buyers’ remorse, but political haggling on the law is now over. After a couple more bits of rubber stamping, it could be etched into the statute book early next year. The rules will apply between 12 and 18 months later, with the stablecoin measures coming in first.  Between now and then, the EU agencies responsible for banking and securities markets will need to set out everything from the design of forms and qualifications for executives, to how crypto firms should measure energy footprints and manage customer complaints.  The industry, aware that the devil is in the details, is watching eagerly. “I think a lot of MiCA's practical success honestly depends on those technical standards,” Circle’s Patrick Hansen told an Oct. 25 conference in Brussels.  Expect a bunch of consultations from EU agencies like the EBA and ESMA to appear around fall 2023. Plus national authorities will need to set out exactly how their procedures will work, including places such as France which already have some form of crypto license.  MiCA matters because it could end up being a template for the world – just as the EU’s ambitious rules in, say, data protection influenced others looking to safeguard privacy online.  “I think there's a reasonable expectation that MiCA will influence rulemaking across the world… it will probably bring efficiencies to a lot of global companies like ours,” Binance’s Director of EU Affairs Hugo Coelho told the same conference [Oct 25].  Sometimes countries copy each others’ homework, and it’s not always a bad thing. The risk of getting overtaken by the EU was certainly noted by lawmakers in the U.K. – formerly a member of the bloc, and now its rival – as they rushed through their own stablecoin plans last week.  Despite its ambition, MiCA leaves a lot out: It doesn’t fully cover decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens or crypto lending. Expect a further report on those issues in 2025, and maybe another bill, too.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/02/analyzing-whats-next-for-europes-markets-in-crypto-assets-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4b10370f816883b0f9c034fb9f303c13099a963-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394148,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXn7P,1667408400,Previewing Next Week's US Midterm Election,"The U.S. election is next week. Control of the Senate and House of Representatives is up for grabs, not to mention state legislatures and governorships. The crypto industry is playing a bigger role in 2022 than it did in 2020, but still not a large enough role to apparently matter overly to the results. Despite that, what happens next week will define crypto legislation in the U.S. for the next two years.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  One week till the elections  The narrative  The U.S. midterm election is next week! There are 435 House seats, 35 Senate seats and, this close to Election Day, still a surprisingly large number of questions about how exactly Congress's divide will shake out next year.  Why it matters  Regulators have increasingly signaled that the only way U.S. crypto companies will see guidelines covering their operations is if Congress acts by passing measures the President can then sign into law. A number of efforts in 2022 are stalling or have stalled, leaving the effort to the 118th Congress.  Breaking it down  There are a few major efforts we might see Congress take up next year.  I wrote about some of the legislative efforts a few weeks ago so I won’t rehash them here. Other legislative efforts include the Lummis-Gillibrand bill, which isn’t so much intended to be passed as a piece of legislation as it is more a compilation of the different issues regulators and industry participants are trying to grapple with. Still, I imagine we’ll see the bill reappear in full or in part next year.  Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is set to retire from the Senate at the end of this term. He introduced a stablecoin bill earlier this year, and it’s unclear whether he has a successor who can take up the effort when Congress returns.  Despite this, there's still a ton of interest in trying to influence candidates and the future of legislation. My colleague Jesse Hamilton took a look at campaign donations for this election cycle, noting that the crypto industry poured over $80 million into races over the past few months – a lot of money, even if it’s not that much compared with the billion dollars donated this year.  That being said, these donations don’t seem to have had a widespread influence just yet. Many candidates supported by the industry lost their primary races, while several who won their races have not yet established firm views on crypto regulations.  Those who have shared crypto views include both familiar names – Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) – as well as newcomers, like Katie Britt, a Republican running for the Senate in Alabama, and Jonathan Jackson, a Democrat running for the House in Illinois.  We’ll have more to come on this over the coming week, and a live blog on election night as polls start closing.  Analyzing MiCA's Next Steps  The European Union is set to be the first major jurisdiction in the world to agree how to regulate the digital asset sector, via its Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA).  Under the recently agreed text, providers of crypto services – which means anything from trading to custody to fiat exchanges – will need a license and be monitored by a financial regulator from one of the EU’s member states (Germany’s BaFin, say).

The bitcoin (BTC) price was trading around $20,300, little changed from the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was staying above the $20,000 level its ninth consecutive day – after previously failing to crack the mark for 18 straight days.  The CoinDesk Market Index was down 1%. Ether (ETH) slid 1% to $1,550 as of press time.  U.S. stock markets followed a similar “wait-and-see” pattern as markets expected the Fed to impose a fourth consecutive 75 basis point (0.75 percentage point) rate hike during the two-day closed-door meeting that started Tuesday in Washington and culminates at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday with an official statement; a press conference is expected afterward with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 0.7%.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk that traders will look toward Powell’s post-meeting commentary to “gauge the Fed's sentiment for future hikes.”  “The point here is to identify a potential pivot point to return toward risk-on assets,” he said.  There have been divergent views on whether the Fed will pivot to a dovish approach on interest rate hikes for the December and subsequent monetary-policy meetings, with major investment banks warning that the Fed could keep raising borrowing costs for longer.  “Markets want clarity on where the Fed will at least pause the current rate hike cycle, but Chair Powell is not really in any position to provide that just yet,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a Wednesday note.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/02/bitcoin-and-ether-steady-ahead-of-fed-decision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25e3f2d23645a003caad9aed817188bb1615ad6a-2327x1745.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394107,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXlXx,1667405576,The Missing CryptoQueen Has Friends in (Very) High Places,"A long-term BBC investigation has discovered new and shocking details about one of the biggest Ponzi schemes of all time. OneCoin, which fraudulently branded itself as a cryptocurrency, appears to have received significant support from high-ranking government leaders in both the United Arab Emirates and Bulgaria. Evidence suggests that included leaking details of an international police search to the fugitives who launched the scam.  Even among cryptocurrency veterans and scam watchers OneCoin is in some ways oddly forgotten. The crypto-inflected Ponzi scheme was launched way back in 2014 and was largely brought down by mid-2017. Founder Ruja Ignatova disappeared on Oct. 25, 2017, and has not been seen since. That means OneCoin had largely faded from the public eye before late 2017’s frenzy of crypto speculation.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But OneCoin was in some bleak sense a pioneer, proving that promises of crypto riches were effective bait for naïve victims. Even though OneCoin never built an actual cryptocurrency, it managed to con people worldwide out of an estimated $4 billion. OneCoin was also the first big crypto scam to go global using multi-level marketing tactics – or more accurately, as a fraudulent pyramid scheme.  See also: Is Crypto a Ponzi? Define 'Ponzi' | Opinion  That makes OneCoin a precursor to the much better-known pyramid scheme BitConnect. BitConnect mimicked much of OneCoin’s approach but has a more prominent place in crypto lore because, frankly, the memes were better.  But Jamie Bartlett and an investigative team at the U.K.’s BBC have been paying very close attention to OneCoin. Starting in 2019, Bartlett and Co. released a podcast, “The Missing CryptoQueen,” chronicling their attempts to track down Ignatova. The series ran for just over a year, producing nine episodes of fascinating but ultimately inconclusive digging.  “The Missing CryptoQueen” uncovered strong evidence that OneCoin was more than just a massive pyramid scheme. Most strikingly, Bartlett and his team found many hints that Ignatova was tied to shadowy figures capable of real violence – quite possibly Eastern European organized crime.  The show seems to have nudged global law enforcement to take the case more seriously, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) adding Ignatova to its Most Wanted list in late June 2022. Bartlett even published a book earlier this year, seeming to put a cap on his team’s efforts – but Ignatova still hasn’t been found.  Then, after a more than two-year hiatus, Bartlett and company returned in late September with shocking new evidence. OneCoin wasn’t simply a mob scheme – it appears the scammers had government backing, from not one but two different governments.  First, Bartlett’s team received secret documents indicating that Ignatova worked with Sheikh Faisal bin Sultan Al Qassimi, a royal in the United Arab Emirates, to release funds that had been frozen over suspicion of money laundering. Ignatova also appears to have bought a $20 million villa in the UAE, which may be where she has been hiding out for half a decade now.  See also: Most Crypto Scams on BNB Chain, Solidus Labs Says  But the most shocking new discovery by Bartlett and his team is evidence that elements within the Bulgarian government were actively helping the OneCoin scammers stay one step ahead of international police.  These new revelations highlight a frightening consequence of the rise of huge global financial frauds in the digital age: Their ability to bring in huge amounts of money can easily attract the involvement of very powerful and dangerous figures, including both mobsters and corrupt government officials. In fact, Bitconnect may have taken this page from the OneCoin book, too: Though it got little play at the time in the West, Indian legislators accused the ruling BJP of complicity in that fraud.  Two new episodes of “The Missing CryptoQueen” are available now, and Bartlett and his team are promising at least one more coming soon.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | BNB,David Z.

42413724,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBw0G,1667405031,Aave Community Members Vote to Deploy on zkSync v2 Testnet,"Community members in the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Aave voted on Wednesday to deploy the protocol to the zkSync 2.0 testnet. The successful vote marks the first stage of Aave's rollout to the new version of the zkSync platform, a layer 2 rollup network on Ethereum that offers users faster transactions and cheaper fees.  Originally put forward by Matter Labs, the firm behind zkSync, the Aave proposal received overwhelming support from community members, with nearly 100% in favor of bringing the decentralized lending service to the Ethereum rollup’s testnet.  Like other Ethereum rollup platforms, zkSync 2.0 is a layer 2 network that aims to scale the famously sluggish, expensive Ethereum base chain. It bundles up transactions and passes them back down to Ethereum's layer 1 blockchain, where they are processed in bulk for a fraction of the cost of regular transactions.  Though Aave has previously launched on other layer 2 platforms, zkSync will mark the first time it has embraces a zero-knowledge rollup – a more advanced, still-in-development alternative to Ethereum's incumbent rollup platforms.  zkSync uses fancy cryptography – so-called called zero-knowledge proofs – to prove that the data it passes down to Ethereum's main chain has not been meddled with. It aims to be among the first products to make this technology accessible to virtually any app that currently runs on Ethereum.  The proposal noted that if liquidity on Aave’s decentralized exchange (DEX) improves, there will be a follow-up vote to bring the DeFi protocol to the zkSync 2.0 mainnet – the production version of the system. Today, the production version of zkSync 2.0, which is still in its ""baby alpha"" phase, has very limited capabilities.  Steve Newcomb, chief product officer at Matter Labs, told CoinDesk that Aave will be a prominent partner in helping bring the rollup to its mainnet in the long term.  “We are building a scaling solution that will enable significant cost savings and performance improvement without affecting security or decentralization, and we want that to be accessible to the whole Ethereum ecosystem and its projects,” Newcomb said.  Aave’s move to zkSync 2.0's testnet follows a similar move from Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange platform, whose community voted to deploy onto the rollup last month.  Aave is the largest decentralized lending platform, with nearly $10 billion locked across all versions of its platform according to DefiLlama.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | UNI,"Cam Thompson, Sam Kessler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/aave-community-members-vote-to-deploy-on-zksync-v2-testnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b63dea5f1777a825569ecd1e4695fac2b2a11f6e-1456x1092.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin 30-Day Volatility Currently Has A Value Of Just 1.7% As per the latest report released by Arcane Research, BTC&apos;s price stabilizing around $20.5k has resulted in the daily volatility remaining low. The &apos;daily volatility&apos; is an indicator that measures the percentage changes in the daily closing price of Bitcoin averaged over a specific period of time. While this timespan can be of any length, the 7-day and 30-day volatilities are the most common and useful version of the metric. When the daily volatility has a high value, it means the crypto&apos;s price has been observing large fluctuations recently.

42413722,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBvzK,1667402431,India Considers Taxing Crypto Income From Businesses Headquartered Elsewhere,"India’s taxation authority has proposed new changes to the filing of income tax returns that could have a significant impact on those holding virtual digital assets (VDA) or cryptocurrencies or possibly even investments in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).  The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has proposed a new common tax return (ITR), which largely consolidates existing income tax returns to make it a smoother process. But the proposal also seeks information from Indians residing abroad about any business connections they may have in India, and whether that entity has a significant economic presence (SEP) in India – particularly businesses from which they draw income.  This may have an impact on any crypto exchanges that are not incorporated in India but still have Indian traders, said Rajat Mittal, a tax counsel in India's Supreme Court advising crypto businesses.  ""A lot of Indian customers are on these exchanges, and this might result in Significant Economic Presence (SEP) for these exchanges. If these exchanges have SEP in India, they might be required to discharge the equalization levy,"" he said.  The equalization levy, which is essentially a foreign company operating tax, was introduced in 2016 with the intention of taxing digital transactions or income that foreign e-commerce companies made from India.  The CBDT has invited comments on the draft from stakeholders and the general public by Dec. 15, 2022.  Many creative professionals, startup founders and those working in the digital economy or Web 3 space have moved abroad due to both the COVID-19 pandemic and the Web 3 revolution allowing for remote workers. The proposed changes to the form could be aimed at people who might have some business connections in India despite leaving.  The new proposal also asks taxpayers questions about their investments, including investments in unincorporated entities. This raises the question of whether an investment in a DAO is an investment in an unincorporated entity.  India has not introduced crypto-specific regulation but imposed what the local industry has criticized as a crippling tax regime while the country's central bank has called for a ban on cryptocurrencies.

42413939,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAnTZ7,1667400262,Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda’s Balance Sheet,"Billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire is officially broken into two main parts: FTX (his exchange) and Alameda Research (his trading firm), both giants in their respective industries.  But even though they are two separate businesses, the division breaks down in a key place: on Alameda’s balance sheet, according to a private financial document reviewed by CoinDesk. (It is conceivable the document represents just part of Alameda.)  That balance sheet is full of FTX – specifically, the FTT token issued by the exchange that grants holders a discount on trading fees on its marketplace. While there is nothing per se untoward or wrong about that, it shows Bankman-Fried’s trading giant Alameda rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto. The situation adds to evidence that the ties between FTX and Alameda are unusually close.  Read the latest: Binance Is Strongly Leaning Toward Scrapping FTX Rescue Takeover After First Glance at Books: Source  The financials make concrete what industry-watchers already suspect: Alameda is big. As of June 30, the company’s assets amounted to $14.6 billion. Its single biggest asset: $3.66 billion of “unlocked FTT.” The third-largest entry on the assets side of the accounting ledger? A $2.16 billion pile of “FTT collateral.”  There are more FTX tokens among its $8 billion of liabilities: $292 million of “locked FTT.” (The liabilities are dominated by $7.4 billion of loans.)  “It’s fascinating to see that the majority of the net equity in the Alameda business is actually FTX’s own centrally controlled and printed-out-of-thin-air token,” said Cory Klippsten, CEO of investment platform Swan Bitcoin, who is known for his critical views of altcoins, which refer to cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin (BTC).  Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison declined to comment. FTX didn't respond to a request for comment.  Other significant assets on the balance sheet include $3.37 billion of “crypto held” and large amounts of the Solana blockchain’s native token: $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.” Bankman-Fried was an early investor in Solana. Other tokens mentioned by name are SRM (the token from the Serum decentralized exchange Bankman-Fried co-founded), MAPS, OXY and FIDA. There is also $134 million of cash and equivalents and a $2 billion “investment in equity securities.”  Read the latest: Bitcoin Falls Below $17K, First Time in 23 Months, as Binance Said to Waver on FTX Deal  Also, token values may be low. In a footnote, Alameda says “locked tokens conservatively treated at 50% of fair value marked to FTX/USD order book.”  Owners of the FTT token get discounts on FTX trading fees, increased commissions on referrals and earn rewards. The value of FTT is maintained by FTX’s rolling program of buying back and burning tokens, a process that eats up a third of the exchange’s trading commissions, which will continue until half of all tokens are burned, according to FTX.  There are about 197 million FTT tokens worth $5.1 billion in circulation, according to FTX’s website.  Tracy Wang and Oliver Knight contributed reporting to this story.

42413715,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBvrq,1667399903,Binance CEO Zhao Suggests Exchange Might Still Allow Russian Users,"LISBON — The head of the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume said new and stronger EU sanctions have created a ""tricky situation"" for dealing with Russian users.  ""We are not against any people,"" said Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, holding a press conference during the Web Summit here on Wednesday. ""We are against dictatorships of war. We’re not against the population. But as a business, we’re licensed in many different places. We have to follow the rules,"" he added.  Asked by CoinDesk whether Binance will follow the decisions of LocalBitcoins, Crypto.com, Kraken and other peers to expel their Russian users, Zhao said he did not have a definitive answer yet.  ""It's a tricky situation,"" he said. While Binance's licensed entities in Europe – France, Italy, Spain, Lithuania, and Sweden among them – definitely wouldn't be able to serve Russian citizens because of sanctions since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, he said the question is less straightforward in jurisdictions outside the EU.  ""We are communicating with the regulators on whether it's OK for us to service Russian users,"" he added. ""How it plays out internationally, we have to see. We're waiting for expert recommendations. It’s a tough situation.""  Zhao has previously called Russia a ""key market"" for Binance, and the exchange has been fairly popular in that country.  Russian citizens' accounts at EU-based crypto services have been being shut down for the last month after the bloc added to its sanctions regime against Russia to punish the country for the ongoing war in Ukraine.  The new rules expanded an earlier ban on digital wallets for Russian citizens containing more than 10,000 euros worth of assets. In the latest iteration introduced Oct. 6, the sanctions prohibited crypto asset wallet, account or custody services to Russian citizens, residents and legal entities, ""irrespective of the amount.""  Major European-based crypto services, including LocalBitcoins, Crypto.com and Blockchain.com, immediately sent Russian users notifications that their accounts would soon be discontinued. Kraken, a U.S.-based exchange with branches in Europe, also restricted accounts of Russian citizens, the Russian-language news website Forklog reported.  Unsurprisingly given such a broad policy, there appear to be at least some cases where sanctions penalized Russians who did not support the war in Ukraine and did not live in Russia, CoinDesk reported.  Read more: EU’s Russian Crypto Ban Confirmed as Bloc Tightens Sanctions  Crypto appears to be where these sanctions have hit the hardest because there have been no similar measures regarding bank accounts for Russian citizens residing in Europe. Also, while the EU is gradually reducing its dependence on Russia’s oil and gas, the latest sanctions still allow European operators in certain cases to help Russia transport its oil for sale in third countries.

42394118,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXmcd,1667398483,"Stop Using the Word 'Platform', and Other DeFi Language Pet Peeves","The saying “It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it” is intended to underscore the idea that tone and confidence can (at least sometimes) take you further than the words you use. Although that may be true in certain instances, that is not true when speaking about concepts relating to decentralized finance, or “DeFi.” Words matter. A lot.  The words we use for DeFi must demonstrate the fundamental differences between the DeFi system and the traditional financial system (TradFi). This is particularly critical now as lawmakers around the world train their focus on DeFi – a relatively nascent innovation – seeking to understand it and regulate it (in some way, shape or form).  Rebecca Rettig is the general counsel of the Aave Companies, a group of software development companies that build blockchain-based software for Web3.  Having given significant consideration to many aspects of the DeFi ecosystem, I have some pet peeves on language used in DeFi. The examples provided here are not comprehensive, but ones that arise consistently, can confuse things and may make the legal and regulatory landscape more challenging.  I have to say it – this is not legal advice (and I am not your lawyer!). The concepts below highlight practical, common-sense approaches to talking about DeFi – ensuring there is no confusion about decentralization. What it means to be decentralized has been the topic of countless articles/posts, podcasts, tweet storms and, while not explicitly addressed here, do form the background for my thoughts.  See also: How DeFi 'Degens' Are Funding the Next Wave of Open Source Development | Opinion  Can we stop using the word 'platform?'  What is a platform? The DeFi protocol plus the front end? The protocol plus the front end plus the DAO [decentralized autonomous organization]? The protocol and the DAO? Just the protocol? Something else entirely?  To add insult to injury, the CeFi [centralized finance] companies also use the term “platform” to refer to their products. “Platform” doesn’t have real meaning in DeFi (or CeFi, I’d argue). If you’re talking about an operational DeFi system – a set of smart contracts setting forth pre-programmed rules for economic transactions – then it’s a “protocol.”  Let’s properly refer to where and how people work in DeFi  If you’re paid by a company or other formal organizational entity to build DeFi software, you work for a software development company. Say that – “I work for X Labs.” If you made a governance proposal, which was accepted by X DAO and now you’re paid by that DAO, only then you “do work for or on a protocol.”  There aren’t any instances where you should say you “work for a protocol”; you can’t work for an autonomous piece of software. If you confuse where and for whom you work, you are mixing up the decentralization part. In other words, if you say you work for X protocol that is now run by X DAO but you really work for X Labs, then you’re conflating what the DevCo [development company] does for the protocol, or what it does not do in the case of decentralization.  There are no 'customers' in DeFi  Those who engage in transactions on a DeFi protocol are “users,” not “customers,” of the protocol or of the DevCo. By definition, customers are entities that buy goods or services from a business. Intermediaries have customers, so there aren’t any customers in a fully decentralized system.  Users of a DeFi protocol are initiating economic transactions on their own via their own wallet – their interactions are peer-to-protocol, without any intermediary.  The protocol is not 'yours,' it’s everyone’s  The protocol isn’t “yours” at X Labs. If X Labs created a decentralized protocol, governed by some form of a DAO, the protocol belongs to the community. If X Labs continues to say, “our protocol” or “our customers” (for shame!) or even “our users,” that is language of an intermediary, an owner or operator.  In a fully decentralized system, there isn’t a centralized owner/operator (and it’s definitely not the DevCo) – just users executing transactions through a smart contract-based protocol.  See also: A Dictionary for Degens | Opinion  DeFi doesn’t 'walk like a duck'  There’s the saying, “If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck.” Although certain features or protocols appear to have similarities to the TradFi system, using the same language in DeFi as in TradFi suggests the same system – a system beset by intermediaries.  If we want to impress upon people that “DeFi is different,” then we must use different language. And if we talk about DeFi in the exact same way as TradFi, it will be nearly impossible to make the notable distinctions between DeFi and TradFi clear and will be even more challenging to get different treatment in the legal/regulatory arena. Let’s make sure DeFi is not treated like a (TradFi) duck.  We can do better with our words, and this nascent, flourishing technology deserves it. As Erik Voorhees wrote, “If [DeFi] does not swell your heart with joy, hope and inspiration, you are missing something.” Changing the way we talk about DeFi – whether you’re a developer, a user, a DAO participant or otherwise – is a very small step on the path to recognizing the hope that DeFi brings for a better system.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Rebecca Rettig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/02/stop-using-the-word-platform-and-other-defi-language-pet-peeves,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c0ea99153c8fcb3a016f4626dce882916971a05-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In fact, earlier today, the crypto managed to register a 10.3% price pump over a 24-hour period as it traded for $0.00001342. But, according to latest tracking from Coingecko, SHIB entered a short-term price correction phase as it is now down by 3.3% on its intraday charts. At press time, it is trading at $0.00001252. Despite this, Shiba Inu is still sitting on a 22.3% increase over the last seven days and it has also tallied a 14% surge during the last 30 days. It is important to note that the time when the crypto made its recent price rally coincides with the time when Dogecoin managed to hit the $0.15 level for the first time since the month of April.

The capital infusion is a sign of confidence after a bumpy mainnet launch in May that needed smoothing out.  The funding will go toward hiring more engineers, developing partnerships and building out the Evmos ecosystem of interoperable decentralized applications (dapps). Other participants in the round included Galaxy Digital, Huobi, HashKey Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Asymmetric and a number of Web3-linked angel investors.  Evmos started out as the open-source Ethermint library of tools for making a Cosmos blockchain that’s fully EVM compatible. It's an environment that’s popular with developers on layer 1 blockchains because of the easy transition from Ethereum. EVM is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the software platform that allows developers to develop dapps for the blockchain.  “We realized we wanted to rebrand to increase the scope of the project to also be an interoperable EVM Cosmos that will enable decentralized applications – not just blockchains – to communicate with each other,” Evmos co-founder Federico Kunze Küllmer told CoinDesk in an interview. “This will enable new use cases for all of these applications, expanding access to liquidity and chains not necessarily running EVM.”  Read more: Evmos Looks to Jump-Start Ethereum–Cosmos Interoperability With Airdrop, Mainnet Launch",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | AIRDROP | TOKEN SALE,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/evmos-connector-of-cosmos-and-ethereum-blockchains-raises-27m-in-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/629db1e07a84d58bc5aef6ed09ed635dfd15db2b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top Stories  Bitcoin and ether were both trading slightly down early Wednesday as markets brace themselves for the Federal Reserve’s announcement later in the day. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points to a range of 3.75% to 4%, which would be the highest level since 2008. While U.S. stocks slipped in advance early Wednesday, one trader is recommending short-term options ""straddles"" in bitcoin and ether to benefit from potential price swings.  Crypto companies continue to lay off staff as crypto winter approaches the actual winter. Crypto venture-capital company Digital Currency Group cut 13% of its staff, Bloomberg reported (DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk), and cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX also reduced its workforce as it pivots to derivatives trading. While the extent of the layoffs wasn’t disclosed, BitMEX dismissed a report suggesting that it had let go 30% of its staff.  Ether is heading toward a deflationary future, according to Citigroup. In a research report, Citi noted the cryptocurrency’s volatility dropped to historic lows in the wake of the Merge, which moved the Ethereum blockchain to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. That resulted in net issuance of ether falling close to zero, whereas before the Merge, annual inflation of supply was around 4.2%, the report said.  Chart of the Day  Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto investment firm Matrixport, has put together this chart, which shows year-on-year changes in the dollar index (DXY) since 1992.  As of Wednesday, the DXY is up 20% year-over-year. In the past, rallies of that magnitude have marked major tops.  A potential bearish turnaround in the greenback may bode well for risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  – Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Crypto Markets Analysis: Money Supply Growth Is Falling, an Encouraging Sign for Fed Progress  France, Switzerland, Singapore to Test DeFi in Forex Markets  Crypto Exchange Deribit Loses $28M in Hot Wallet Hack, Pauses Withdrawals",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/02/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-ether-slip-ahead-of-fed-more-crypto-layoffs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5a441ff5b587ba33a2764ff30e6b3d9b3b6f027-3829x2872.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Last year, Bitdeer announced that it was merging with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. But according to Wednesday's filing, the SPAC will hold a shareholder meeting to vote on extending the deadline to close the deal to as late as Dec. 14, 2023.  Bitcoin (BTC) miners have been struggling with liquidity, and raising capital has proved difficult amid the market downturn. Their margins have dwindled as the price of bitcoin is low while energy prices are high.  The deadline has already been extended twice by three months each, and the SPAC is asking shareholders for the discretion to continue pushing it back, with another four three-month extensions, the filing says.  Bitdeer offers cloud-mining services, meaning customers can rent computing power from machines that Bitdeer owns and operates.

Trading at below 6 cents one week ago, DOGE rallied to as high as above 15 cents on Tuesday thanks to Elon Musk, the world's richest person, closing his Twitter purchase and hope of some sort of integration with the popular social-media platform.  As of Tuesday, the ratio between DOGE's going market price and the 200-day simple-moving average (SMA), also known as the Mayer Multiple, stood at 1.83, the highest since June 2021, according to data provided by charting platform TradingView.  Not surprisingly Dogecoin's Mayer Multiple is the highest among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  ""Dogecoin rallied over 100% last week on speculation of integration with Twitter. The surge is meaningful on its chart, noting the breakout above the 200-day MA and former peaks,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, wrote in a note to clients.  The chart shows DOGE has surged past its 200-day SMA, Ichimoku cloud (the blue shaded area) and the Aug. 16 high of 9.17 cents, turning the resistance into support. Crossovers above or below the cloud are widely taken to represent early signs of a bullish or bearish trend change.  According to Stockton, DOGE's breakout may have long-term implications if the bulls manage to build a new base above the former resistance-turned-support of 9.17 cents marked by the horizontal line on the above chart.  Yet chasing the rally now may be risky because of the possibility of a ""sell-the-news"" event, according to Stockton. Musk completed his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter late last week. So, traders who bought DOGE ahead of that event might book a profit, fueling a price pullback.  That may be happening already as DOGE is down 8.5% on Wednesday morning to 12.9 cents, off nearly 17% from its peak level on Tuesday.  And while the MACD (moving average divergence/convergence) histogram, the indicator below the price chart, shows strong upward momentum, the stochastic oscillator has turned lower from above-80 or overbought levels, suggesting scope for a bull breather or temporary price pullback.

The company has three special-purpose vehicles specifically for financing the purchase of mining equipment. Together the three have $104 million of debt outstanding.

Riley over the next two years, which would give the bank a stake of up to 31% in the miner.

42413716,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBvue,1667392438,Crypto Investor a16z Wants to Join Ooki DAO Defense Against CFTC,"Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, is seeking permission from a federal court to join an ongoing lawsuit.  It wants to argue the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) must serve individual members of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) instead of targeting the protocol itself.  The CFTC must comply with applicable laws in the state of California when serving an unincorporated association, said a friend of the court brief filed on Tuesday by a16z.  The venture capital giant is the latest entity requesting to join the case against Ooki DAO, in which the CFTC alleges the DAO had violated federal commodities laws by offering illegal leveraged and margin crypto trading products to U.S. residents. In early October, the District Court for the Northern District of California ruled the commodities regulator was allowed to serve the DAO via a website help bot and forum post.  Read more: A16z Doesn't Support Plan to Break Up DeFi Giant MakerDAO  Since then, District Judge William Orrick has allowed a group of lawyers and software developers called LeXpunK Army and lobby group DeFi Education Fund (DEF) to join the case and argue against the CFTC serving DAO members through a website bot. A few days later, crypto venture capital fund Paradigm Operations also asked the federal court for permission to join Ooki DAO's defense, saying the regulator's attempt to target all of the DAO's voting token holders wholesale ""threatens to seriously distort the law.""  Miles Jennings, head of decentralization at a16z, tweeted on Thursday that his firm was focusing on an additional point on ""why the CFTC should regulate apps, not protocols.""  In its brief, a16z argues the CFTC is currently seeking to do something California law does not allow, which is to ""serve a diffuse and unidentified group of individuals alleged to be engaged in unlawful conduct.""  Allowing the CFTC to proceed against the DAO in its current course ""could imperil an entire industry by chilling participation in decentralized governance or community activity,"" the brief said.  The CFTC can amend its complaint ""to remove the protocol and instead focus on the specific governance votes and illegal actions of individual Ooki DAO members in the operation of the Ooki App (the website),"" Jennings tweeted.  The hearing on the brief is scheduled for Nov. 30.

42411716,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfK6Y,1667392200,What You Need to Know About 401(k) Accounts With Bitcoin,"Fidelity Investments, the largest 401(k) custodian in the United States, made national news in April with the announcement it will be offering direct bitcoin (BTC) allocations in its 401(k) accounts. Social media was buzzing after the announcement because Fidelity has over $2 trillion under management in 401(k) accounts. The firm stated it would allow for bitcoin allocations of up to 20% in a client's 401(k) account. This represents a potential $400 billion of new capital that could be used to purchase bitcoin.  Bitcoin has been held in retirement accounts for a while now, either through self-directed individual retirement accounts (IRA) or self-directed 401(k)s, through investment vehicles such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) or even more recently via bitcoin futures ETFs. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Read More: What Is a Bitcoin ETF?  How are 401(k)s used?  A 401(k) account represents, for most Americans, their biggest opportunity to save for retirement. 401(k) accounts are designed to be accumulation tools, offered by employers to their employees, where participants save money and build wealth. Contributions are typically deducted automatically from a paycheck and invested into a mix of equity and bond mutual funds. In 2021, 401(k) balances reached their highest point in history. When viewed as the primary tool in retirement planning, it is important to have a strategy and to understand what assets you own and why you own them.  Traditionally, 401(k) participants use their accounts to purchase equities and bonds in a cost-effective and tax-efficient manner. Participants often use dollar cost averaging over a long period of time for their 401(k) accounts with the goal of being able to live off the income the portfolio generates via dividends and periodic withdrawals.  Bitcoin is not a cash-flowing equity  It is important to understand that bitcoin is not a stock, bitcoin does not pay a dividend nor distribute capital gains to its holders. Other cryptocurrencies may pay “income,” or a yield, generated via staking, but bitcoin does not. Many equities pay dividends to their stakeholders and bonds pay a yield to holders. Understanding why an individual would allocate funds to bitcoin, especially in an account designed for retirement income, is important.  Read more: What Is Bitcoin?  It is relatively easy to understand the concept of investing into cash-flowing equities or yield-generating bonds. The income from these traditional investments is usually reinvested, along with new cash contributions made each pay period, until the 401(k) owner retires and begins to live off the portfolio income. 401(k) participants typically use an aggressive asset allocation while young, and change asset allocation to be more conservative as they reach retirement age and begin withdrawing from the portfolio.  Bitcoin in a 401(k) as a hedge or emerging store of value  Bitcoin is seen by many as a hedge asset. Many bitcoin holders believe that it is wise, similar to an investment in precious metals, to allocate a certain percentage of one’s net worth into an asset that is not controlled by a central entity. Bitcoin is an open-source, decentralized network, and many believe it is an emerging store of value. Many people view bitcoin as an insurance-like instrument that will protect their wealth in the event of a systemic failure. An allocation to an asset seen as a store of value and a hedge against governmental or central bank errors represents a responsible and reasonable approach.  Read More: The Link Between Bitcoin and Inflation  Other investors believe bitcoin is an emerging technology that will power the future of many industries. An allocation to bitcoin viewed through the lens of an emerging technology would be similar to an allocation to a growth stock position or a more specific equity strategy. Many 401(k) plans offer participants the opportunity to invest in broad-based index funds or more specific, actively managed funds that may include large-cap growth or small-cap growth company stocks. Viewing bitcoin as an investment into emerging technology is a responsible way to view the asset.  It is important to note that an allocation to bitcoin represents an alternative allocation and must be done with caution.  Develop an investment thesis and portfolio rules  Before allocating funds to bitcoin in a 401(k) or IRA, investors must determine why they want to make such a unique allocation. Allocating to bitcoin solely because one believes the price may rise may not be the best decision. The investor must decide why bitcoin should have a place in his or her portfolio – for example, as a market hedge or as an active allocation to an emerging technology – and then must design rules for portfolio management.  Read More: Why Invest in Cryptocurrency?  Bitcoin-invested 401(k)s and portfolio rebalancing  Typically, as an investor nears retirement, portfolio risk and volatility will decrease. This is traditionally done by lessening exposure to equities and buying more bonds. This decreases volatility protects the portfolio from too much downside market risk. When an alternative asset allocation, such as a position in bitcoin, is introduced into a portfolio, new rules must be considered to control for risk. Bitcoin is an incredibly volatile asset and, if left unmanaged, may grow to a very large position in a portfolio, raising risk and increasing volatility. During bear markets, a bitcoin position may decrease from the target allocation, which means investors must have rules that will rebalance the portfolio back to target allocations. Using a rules-based approach to 401(k) management decreases the risk that emotions will drive the portfolio allocation – which in turn, increases portfolio returns over time.  Just because bitcoin is available doesn’t mean you need it in your 401(k)  401(k)s and IRAs are very important accounts to nearly every U.S. retiree. These accounts are the best tools we have for building retirement portfolios, so the money in these accounts is extremely important to the owner’s future well-being. Allocating to a speculative asset like bitcoin just because it’s suddenly available is not a wise decision. An investor must develop an investment thesis and develop portfolio management rules when allocating to these alternative strategies.  The innovation and store of value opportunities that are seen in the crypto asset class are unprecedented, but investors must be responsible with allocations and portfolio management – especially when allocating to highly volatile assets like crypto. Investors should not treat their 401(k)s like a hedge fund or a day trading account. These retirement accounts are best used for long-term wealth accumulation and valuable tools used in preparing for future income needs. When used correctly, bitcoin may help investors accomplish these goals. However, like any other alternative asset, when used incorrectly or irresponsibly, it may harm investments for the long term and make retirement that much more difficult.

42413729,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBw5s,1667392200,Solana-Based NFT Marketplace Exchange.Art Creates Royalties Protection Standard,"While several non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces have recently shifted to royalty-optional models, one platform is introducing a standard to ensure NFT creators continue to get paid.  Solana-based fine art NFT marketplace Exchange.Art has launched what it calls a “Royalties Protection Standard” that will enforce creator royalties on secondary sales of NFTs that originate on its platform, the company said Wednesday.  Alex Fleseriu, CEO of Exchange Art, told CoinDesk that because the platform was originally built for artists “exploited” by the lack of set royalties in the fine art world, it remains motivated to help artists more fairly earn their share in Web3.  “It is an opt-in basis type of program that essentially prevents creators' work from being ‘forced-listed’ on unintended marketplaces, where royalties are simply not honored,” said Fleseriu. “We are responsible for building tools that creators need to make a living.”  Through Exchange.Art’s “allow list” feature, creators will be able to choose which secondary platforms their tokens can be listed on, allowing them to earn guaranteed royalties as their work changes hands in perpetuity.  In August, NFT marketplace X2Y2 dropped its royalty requirements, allowing users to contribute to artists at their discretion. In October, Solana-based platform Magic Eden followed with an optional royalties structure, and most recently, LooksRare stopped enforcing royalties, instead sharing a 25% protocol fee between the platform and artists.  While some platforms are doing away with royalty requirements, others are modifying their structures to support creators. On Tuesday, Stepn parent company Find Satoshi Lab released an NFT marketplace that aims to protect artists by enforcing royalty percentages between 0.5% and 10%.  “We want to shift [the space] from value extraction to value creation, because there is room for this market to grow enormously…more and more creators are being onboarding to Web3 every single minute, but we have to treat them with respect,” explained Fleseriu.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/02/solana-based-nft-marketplace-exchangeart-creates-royalties-protection-standard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6bebbafd41ca6bb9923902153c04f1e8b07c423-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413719,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBvwW,1667392200,Coinbase’s Interest Income May Be Bright Spot Amid Challenging Third Quarter,"Crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) may post another weak quarter in terms of revenue and trading volumes amid tough macroeconomic conditions, but several analysts expect that interest income could be a bright spot.  “For Q3, we are forecasting revenues below the Street as exchange volumes declined in September,” Barclays analyst Benjamin Budish told clients in a note earlier in October. “But the new story we see developing for Coinbase is interest income: While rates were low (and crypto markets were hot), investors paid little attention to this revenue driver,” Budish added.  For the third quarter, Budish estimates that Coinbase could have generated $137 million in total interest income across its stablecoin business, customer fiat holdings and its corporate cash balance.  Interest income  For 2023, Budish forecasts Coinbase’s interest income reaching almost $1.4 billion, given increases in short-term interest rates, while JPMorgan recently estimated that figure could be a slightly lower $1.2 billion. Coinbase’s joint venture with USDC issuer Circle alone could contribute about $700 million in incremental revenue in 2023, JPMorgan added.  More recently, the MakerDAO community approved a proposal to place as much as $1.6 billion in USD coin (USDC) with Coinbase Prime, where it will yield 1.5%.  As for its corporate cash balance and customer fiat holdings, Coinbase reported having roughly $5.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents in its second-quarter earnings report, in addition to having just over $7 billion in customer custodial cash.  Earlier in the third quarter, some analysts saw ether staking following The Merge as a potential near-term positive catalyst for Coinbase, though that does not appear to have materialized.  “Despite the highly anticipated Ethereum Merge, we estimate staking revenue will not materially change between Q2 and Q3 given the declining average crypto prices between the two quarters,” Needham’s John Todaro told clients in a note. “Ethereum staking deposits have yet to see the large uptick that the community was hoping for. More than one month post merge, ETH deposited in staking pools stands at just 14.3 [million] ETH (~12% of the total network supply),” Todaro added.  Third-quarter estimates  Analysts expect Coinbase to post an overall adjusted Q3 loss of $2.37 per share on revenue of $646 million, according to FactSet. The consensus revenue estimate compares with $808 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.  Trading volumes continue to fall, according to Mizuho, which has been more bearish versus peer analysts on the stock. “3Q trading activity on Coinbase has been range-bound of late, and lack of volatility has weighed on volumes,” analyst Dan Dolev wrote in a recent note to clients. Additionally, Dolev sees the interest income boost being short-lived as Coinbase’s customers could seek higher-yielding alternatives for their cash deposits.  For Coinbase’s stock, it may remain a longer-term story barring a significant jump in crypto prices.  Coinbase is “explicitly tied to crypto prices at this point, but we anticipate that patience will be rewarded as we believe the company remains in a leading competitive position, is actively diversifying its business model, and will experience better pricing resiliency than the bear thesis argues,” JMP’s Devin Ryan told clients in a note.

42413731,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBw8g,1667391567,Switzerland Sticks to Tougher ID Checks for Crypto to Cash Transactions,"The Swiss financial regulator is extending money-laundering checks for crypto transactions despite significant pushback from the country’s users.  Customers will have to prove their identity if they make transactions that total 1,000 Swiss francs ($1,000) or more over the course of a month when they swap crypto for cash or another anonymous form of money.  “Virtual currencies are often used as a payment instrument for illicit trade, notably in drug trafficking, on the darknet, or for the payment of ransoms after cyberattacks,” a report issued by the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma) said. “The risk of money laundering in the domain of virtual currency is reinforced by potential anonymity and by the speed and cross-border nature of transactions.”  A consultation published by Finma in May proposed to tighten up the 1,000-franc limit which is currently measured daily, with a view to stopping ""smurfing"" – the breaking up of a large payment into smaller ones to avoid money-laundering checks.  But the regulator received multiple responses from citizens and crypto companies who said that the new rules weren't neutral between different technologies and that stores of customer data would be prone to hacking.  On Wednesday, Finma said it “stands by” its plans and declined requests to increase the threshold to as much a 25,000 francs, but conceded the new rules would apply only for anonymous transactions such as those on crypto ATMs.  Switzerland has sought to set itself out as a crypto hub, but regulators are keen to shake off its reputation as a site for money laundering, given the historic secrecy of its banking sector.

42393764,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAmeR,1667387700,What to Expect From Ethereum’s Next Big Upgrade,"Ethereum’s highly publicized recent update, “the Merge,” radically changed how the second-biggest blockchain network works by eliminating its reliance on cryptocurrency miners and dramatically reducing its energy costs. The network’s next upgrade, “Shanghai,” will focus on tying up loose ends.  After a month-long break, Ethereum’s developers reconvened last week for the (typically bi-weekly) Ethereum All Core Developers Zoom call. The motley crew of companies and individuals that maintain Ethereum’s open-source codebase discussed the features they intend to include in the network’s next update.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The developers did not align on a timeline or full feature set, but they did reaffirm that a core focus of Shanghai would be to enable Ethereum validators to withdraw the crypto they “staked” to help operate the network.  The Merge brought proof-of-stake to Ethereum, a system which pays validators interest if they stake – or lock up – ether (ETH), Ethereum's native currency, with the network. Currently, staked ETH can’t be unstaked, or withdrawn. Shanghai will change that, and validators will also gain access to whatever rewards they’ve earned from staking.  Alongside withdrawals, Shanghai is poised to introduce a handful of minor, developer-oriented tweaks to the Ethereum protocol. The list of goals, which is still being finalized, is viewable on Ethereum’s official github.  A long-wished-for feature is, however, missing from the Shanghai spec sheet, at least for now: proto-Danksharding. Ethereum’s gas fees – what users pay to complete an Ethereum transaction – are famously high, making certain kinds of transactions unaffordable. That was especially true as the crypto bull market peaked late last year.  Proto-Danksharding, once it’s released, will mark the first phase of a long-planned transition to sharding – a method of splitting up network activity into “shards” as a way to increase its capacity and bring down fees.  It’s unclear when proto-Danksharding will make its way into Ethereum’s next update. On the last developer call, researchers signaled that plans for the feature may be finalized in the next month or so.  That said, Ethereum development goals often are overly optimistic. There was talk of the Merge happening years ago. It took place in September. And even if proto-Danksharding does make it into the Shanghai spec sheet, the full “Danksharding” vision – a fully realized version of sharding that could dramatically improve the network’s usability – remains several months (or years) away.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/02/what-to-expect-from-ethereums-next-big-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c26edf52468746e83d5b318b07cb5949577c46c6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As NewsBTC has reported in recent weeks, financial markets around the world are hanging on every word from the Federal Reserve to predict future policies. Currently, there is little doubt that the FED will raise the interest rate by 75 basis points (bps) today, which would be the fourth consecutive hike. However, for the next meetings in December and January, the futures market is divided. To that extent, the main focus of today&apos;s session will be on the signals that the FED sends with regard to a possible slowdown in the pace of rate hikes. Currently, the market assumes a 50% probability of a rate hike of 75 basis points in December. Related Reading: Fed Could Hike Interest Rates By 75 BPS, Here&apos;s What It Means For Bitcoin Hawkish Or Dovish? As in previous meetings, Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, will probably not want to signal that a slowdown in the pace of rate hikes signals an earlier end to tightening or a lower peak rate. Dovish signals could be associated by the market with a slowing of the December rate hike by as little as 50 basis points.

Project Mariana, coordinated by the Innovation Hub of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), is looking at whether protocols used in intermediary-free decentralized finance (DeFi) can replace traditional, more laborious processes for matching buyers and sellers of different fiat currencies.  “DeFi and its applications have the potential to become systemically important parts of the financial ecosystem,” the BIS said in a statement on its website. It added that automated market makers can become ""the basis for a new generation of financial infrastructure.""  Those automated protocols use stores of liquidity and algorithms to determine the prices between tokenized assets – such as the central bank digital currencies (CBDC) the three countries may decide to issue in the future.  Project Mariana is the latest in a series of projects hosted by the BIS, which works with the world’s central banks, to examine whether state-issued digital currencies could have applications in everyday transactions or financial markets.  Meanwhile, officials are also struggling with how to regulate DeFi, given that there’s no obvious entity to heap obligations on. One study from the BIS last December even called DeFi an “illusion,” saying that centralized governance is inescapable.

42415101,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXGwe,1667379902,Citi Says Ether May Be Moving Toward a Deflationary Future,"The most significant impact of the Ethereum blockchain’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), a process known as the Merge, was the change in net issuance of ether (ETH), which fell close to zero, Citi (C) said in a research report Monday.  Before the Merge, issuance was stable at 2 ETH a block, resulting in annual inflation of supply of around 4.2%, the report said. Following the Merge, proof-of-work (PoW) issuance stopped, leaving only staking yield issuance, which is partly offset by burning – or removing from circulation – the fees.  The Merge was the first of five upgrades planned for the blockchain and involved the shift from PoW to a more energy-efficient PoS consensus mechanism.  “Ether looks like it could be moving towards a deflationary future as it exhibits periods of deflation amidst low network activity,” analysts led by Joseph Ayoub wrote. As activity rises it could maintain a deflationary supply having “already shown deflationary tendencies post-Merge in a low-burn environment.”  Citi says the switch to PoS has removed about 564,000 ETH from circulation in the six weeks since the Merge, compared with if PoW issuance was still occurring. In U.S. dollar terms this represents about $870 million. Annualized, it equates to a reduction of about $7.7 billion in active ETH supply following the transition to PoS.  Recent moves in the price of ether look to be driven by derivatives markets. Open interest has risen to the highest levels since April, when the cryptocurrency was trading at around $3,000, the note said. “This marks one of the largest divergences between price and open interest over the last [three] years,” and indicates further volatility is likely, according to the note.  The bank says this indicates a high amount of leverage in the derivatives market, “which may be the tail wagging the ‘spot-price’ dog.” Ether 30-day historical volatility reached record lows following the success of the Merge upgrade, but is rising following the cryptocurrency’s breakout from its recent trading range, the bank added.  Open interest reflects the total number of derivative contracts held by investors in active positions.

42415104,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXHCZ,1667379664,Ether and Bitcoin 'Straddles' Can Help Capture Post-Fed Price Swings,"Investors who foresee renewed volatility in ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) can consider building an option strategy that profits from an increase in price turbulence.  Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, recommended buying short-term ether options ""straddles"" to benefit from potential price swings following Wednesday's all-important U.S. Federal Reserve rate decision.  Buying a straddle involves purchasing both bullish call and bearish put options with the same expiry and at the same level or strike price. Buying a call means purchasing insurance against bullish price moves while buying a put implies hedging against price slides. Option buyers pay a premium to sellers as compensation for offering protection.  When an entity buys a straddle, it's doing so in hopes that the underlying asset will either surge or tank enough to recover more than what was paid to purchase the strategy.  ""Ether is expected to move by +/- 5.85% after the [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting, based on derivatives markets data. This implies that ether will finish the week at $1,485 or $1,670 (spot $1,578). This seems too narrow. Buying short-term straddles (buy calls and buy puts), which benefit from wide swings, might offer good risk reward here,"" Thielen said in a note sent to clients early Wednesday.  Expectations for post-Fed price turbulence appear underpriced and options tied to Ethereum's native token look cheap. The annualized one-month ether implied volatility, or traders' expectations for price turbulence over four weeks, currently stands at 81% versus 96%, seen ahead of the September Fed meeting, according to data tracked by Matrixport.  Implied volatility has a positive impact on options prices. Traders often compare implied volatility over specific periods to gauge whether volatility expectations are overpriced/underpriced and options are trading cheap or costly. The common mantra is to buy options when implied volatility is cheap relative to its historical standard/realized volatility and sell options when the implied volatility is too high.  ""Implied volatility is roughly 15 [volatility] points lower compared to the last FOMC meeting, which makes option prices significantly cheaper than at the last FOMC meeting,"" Thielen noted.  The bitcoin market has seen a similar ""implied volatility meltdown"" in recent weeks, making options cheaper.  Bitcoin's annualized three-month implied volatility recently slipped to nearly 50%, a level seen only five times since 2020. The one-month implied volatility dropped to 56%, according to data from Arcane Research and derivatives analytics platform Laevitas.  ""The low implied volatilities are a suitable environment for contrarian bets on reappearing BTC volatility,"" Lunde wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.  ""The timing could be great for straddle strategies purchasing far-dated expiring puts and calls. Straddles look cheap."" Lunde added.  Straddles look simple, but they are not without risks. A trader can lose the entire amount paid as compensation to call and put seller if the market stays flat.  That said, several key events are lined up for the coming weeks, promising to inject volatility into markets.  ""Traders should prepare for volatility in the coming weeks, as the event calendar is crowded with potentially market-moving events. Wednesday's FOMC press conference is this week's key event, but company earnings (MicroStrategy on Nov. 1, Coinbase on Nov. 3), economic data, and U.S. mid-terms may also lead markets to move,"" Lunde said.  Bitcoin traded near $20,400 at press time. The cryptocurrency has been dead flat for nearly two months, barring the past week's minor spike of 5%, CoinDesk data shows.

42415088,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXFf3,1667367868,"Singapore Starts Two New Token Pilots With Standard Chartered, HSBC and Others","The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said that it is starting two new pilot projects to explore the use of tokens in trade finance and wealth management.  The first pilot is being lead by Standard Chartered (STAN) to explore tokens for trade finance, and another pilot to look at tokenization of wealth management products. The wealth management pilot involves HSBC (HSBC), UOB working with Marketnode, a digital asset platform built by the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and Temasek.  “By transforming trade assets into transferable instruments, we aim to improve the accessibility to an asset class – which has largely been the domain of banks – with participation from a broader range of investors,"" said Kai Fehr, global head of trade and working capital at Standard Chartered. ""Not only can we potentially narrow the $1.7 trillion global trade finance gap, this also offers investors the option to balance their portfolio with a digital token that has traceable intrinsic value,” he added.  The central bank also announced on Wednesday the successful completion of the first trades using tokenized versions of the yen and the Singapore dollar, as well as government bond securities. The program was started to test the application of decentralized finance (DeFi), where financial activities are carried out on a blockchain without the use of third parties, in the wholesale funding market, which are used by banks to maintain liquidity.  The project involved Singapore’s DBS Bank, JPMorgan (JPM) and Japan’s SBI Digital, along with Marketnode, and was developed and deployed on the Polygon blockchain.  Han Kwee Juan, group head of strategy and planning at DBS, told CoinDesk in an interview how the major banks can use DeFi to carry out traditional financial activities.  “We wanted to show it was possible to tokenize government securities and cash within a DeFi liquidity pool,” said Han. “Then, using an [automated market maker], and solving for that with price oracles and market data streaming services from Bloomberg or Refinitiv, we wanted to create an institutional-grade DeFi venue which regulators would be comfortable with.”  Read more: Singapore’s DBS Explains How Big Banks Can Implement DeFi, Too  UPDATE (Nov. 2, 07:06 UTC): Adds comment from Standard Chartered in third paragraph.

42415105,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXH7G,1667366842,Rogue Actor Disrupts Lightning Network With a Single Transaction,"A Twitter user by the name “Burak” (@brqgoo) sent a large swath of the Lightning Network into turmoil on Tuesday morning when he allegedly created a non-standard Bitcoin transaction that prevented users from opening new Lightning channels (connections between Lightning nodes).  Lightning is a layer 2 network that runs atop the Bitcoin blockchain to enable cheaper and faster transactions. Burak’s valid but non-standard transaction caused Bitcoin nodes running an implementation of Bitcoin called btcd to reject valid incoming blocks. This caused a corresponding glitch on all Lightning Network Daemon (LND) nodes. LND nodes rely on information from btcd Bitcoin nodes, and the glitch caused LND nodes to deny all new channel opening requests.  Read more: Kollider Raises $2.4M to Build ‘Lightning-Native’ Financial Products  Burak’s shenanigans disrupted a good chunk of the Bitcoin and Lightning ecosystems. Nevertheless, one could argue the community’s anti-fragility was on full display. Core Lightning (CLN) nodes that rely on Bitcoin Core, the most popular implementation of Bitcoin, were unaffected (although this seems to have been by design). Additionally, the bug Burak exploited was quickly patched (thanks to Elle Mouton and Oliver Gugger).  “Given the context, it seems Burak was well aware of the consequences triggered by the transaction. I think everyone can decide for themselves if that is to be considered malicious or not,” Rene Pickhardt, Bitcoin and Lightning developer and educator, told CoinDesk. Pickhardt co-authored the popular “Mastering Lightning” book and helped demystify many technical aspects of this story.  How should Bitcoin handle bugs and exploits?  Burak’s actions not only sparked lively exchanges on Twitter, but also raised a key question – how should the Bitcoin community handle similar exploits in the future?  “Generally, developers promote a well-known culture of responsible disclosure and ethics when discovering exploitable bugs. Lightning Labs had a reasonable plan for patching this problem beforehand, but maybe Burak felt the situation was more urgent and wanted to light a fire under [them],” John Carvalho told CoinDesk. Carvalho is the CEO of Bitcoin software firm, Synonym. The firm’s chief technology officer, Reza Bandegi, also helped clarify technical aspects for this report.  Read more: Bitcoin Software Company Synonym Launches Bitkit, a Bitcon Wallet Powered by Slashtags Protocol  What Carvalho is describing could be further incentivized by establishing robust bug bounty programs. “It's always hard to prepare against a novel bug. I guess more review and bug bounty programs for responsible disclosure may help.” Pickhardt weighed in. “However, as I understand, Pieter Wuille thinks there may sometimes be a risk in fixing bugs, as that may raise awareness and attract potential malicious actors in the transition phase while nodes update.”  Indeed, Bitcoin developer Pieter Wuille thinks the process of fixing bugs and managing exploits is not always straightforward.  “I don't think it's necessarily that simple. It'd be reasonable to assume that exploiting this needed cooperation from miners (or ones with non-standard mempool/relay policy at least), making it harder to pull off. And fixing this one-line without raising suspicion is hard,” Wuille tweeted.  Wuille has a point. Rumors were circulating that Burak paid $700 to F2Pool, one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools, to have his non-standard transaction included in one of their blocks. He then embedded a bizarre message in the transaction, “You'll run CLN and you'll be happy,"" a reference to Core Lightning (CLN), which, as discussed above, is an alternative to LND, the Lightning implementation affected by the exploit.  “I can't speak for Burak, but it took some special effort and expense to perform his demonstration, so I have to assume he knew exactly what he was doing and that he at least wanted to draw attention to himself, LND, and apparently, CLN too, because he left a supportive message for CLN within the instigating transaction on-chain,” Carvalho explained.  Christian Decker, a researcher at Bitcoin infrastructure firm, Blockstream and contributor to the CLN project, distanced his team from the exploit and publicly denounced Burak’s actions.

Can diversification of cryptocurrency assets mitigate risk in a highly volatile asset class? As with any investment portfolio, timeframe, risk tolerance and risk capacity all play key roles. By Tyrone Ross and Erik Smith Over the past 13 years, the cryptocurrency market has reached a cumulative market capitalization in the trillions. As of September 2022, Lukka Enterprise Data has listed 50 cryptocurrency assets with a market capitalization of over USD 1 billion. With an increasing number of investment options to choose from, many market participants are wondering: Should digital asset portfolios be diversified? Can diversification of cryptocurrency assets mitigate risk in a highly volatile asset class? Generally speaking, financial advisors and investors tend to diversify broadly across asset classes and within asset classes. After all, actively picking investments is incredibly difficult. As Craig Lazzara, Managing Director and Global Head of Index Investment Strategy for S&P Dow Jones Indices, points out , “Returns are typically driven by a relatively small number of strong performers, which pull the index’s return above that of most of its constituents.” There are decades of historical performance data that support this observation in the equity markets. Does the same apply in the digital asset markets? Let’s take a look at four S&P Digital Market Indices: S&P Bitcoin Index S&P Cryptocurrency MegaCap Index S&P Cryptocurrency LargeCap Index S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index Looking at back-tested data, over the past five years (as of Sept. 30, 2022), the S&P Bitcoin Index and S&P Cryptocurrency MegaCap Index outperformed the broader cryptocurrency indices on an annualized risk-adjusted return basis. The S&P Cryptocurrency MegaCap Index, which combines Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ether ( ETH-USD ) into one index weighted by market capitalization, led the way in absolute returns, posting a 36.21% annualized five-year return. The S&P Bitcoin Index came in a close second on an absolute return basis, posting a 36.12% annualized five-year return. Similar to previous market downturns, Bitcoin has held up better than the vast majority of cryptocurrency assets in 2022. However, over a three-year timeframe, Bitcoin lagged the more diversified crypto-asset indices in both absolute and risk-adjusted annualized returns. The S&P Cryptocurrency MegaCap Index, which includes Bitcoin and Ethereum, led the way during this timeframe (see Exhibit 2). As we can see in Exhibit 3, Ethereum’s share of the total crypto-asset market cap has grown slightly since the beginning of 2017, now making up over 17% of the total digital asset market. Bitcoin’s market cap, which accounted for approximately 90% of the cryptocurrency market at the beginning of 2017, has fallen to around 39% dominance. This is still a high percentage compared to most asset classes. So how could diversifying away from Bitcoin have affected portfolios? The data suggests diversifying would have resulted in higher absolute and risk-adjusted returns over the past three years, while underperforming Bitcoin over the past five years. Closing Thoughts As with any investment portfolio, timeframe, risk tolerance and risk capacity all play key roles. Similar to how investors had a difficult time gauging which technology companies would thrive following the internet boom in the 1990s, it is equally difficult to predict which cryptocurrencies will gain or lose market share in the future. With limited historical data to base our analysis on, we are left pondering what the future holds for this new asset class that is growing exponentially.

Insights: Ripple's policy director for the Asia Pacific rim region noted a shift in Hong Kong's recent policy statement, but said the industry needs more details.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  DOGE Continues to Climb; Bitcoin Trades Flat  By James Rubin  The DOGE were on the loose again in Tuesday trading, while bitcoin and ether remained more tightly leashed.  The popular meme coin was recently trading over 13 cents, a more than 12% gain for the past 24 hours and its highest point since late April. DOGE has been soaring since the middle of last week as billionaire entrepreneur and dogecoin enthusiast Elon Musk neared the close of his $44 billion purchase of social media platform Twitter.  BTC and ETH were recently changing hands sideways with the largest cryptocurrency in market value down a smidgen and ether in the green. Bitcoin held its place snuggling above the $20,000 threshold it assumed more than a week ago amid hopeful signs the U.S. central bank will scale back its current diet of hefty interest rate hikes by early next year, if not sooner. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, will likely announce a fourth consecutive 75 basis point increase on Wednesday.  Yet recent indicators suggest that inflation will soon be waning meaningfully without throwing the economy into a harsh recession. As CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams wrote, investors hoping for a more dovish turn in monetary policy may look optimistically at a percentage decline in the M2 money supply growth from a year ago. The parabolic increase in U.S. money supply during 2020 is largely behind the current inflationary environment. The reduced supply growth could be evidence that recent Federal Reserve measures are working.  DOGE was not the only altcoin to surge as UNI recently rose 3.3%. Decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap’s native token was up more than 5.1% at one point and has climbed more than 10% over the past week. The gains have followed Uniswap's closing of a $165 million Series B funding round earlier in October.  Meanwhile, equity markets closed down slightly with the tech heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.  Noting an unexpected increase in job openings in the latest U.S. JOLTs (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) data, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote pessimistically that ""momentum was building on expectations for the Fed to downshift their tightening pace in December, but now that call seems like it may have been premature. Rates might need to stay higher for longer if the labor market is still healthy and inflation ends up being stickier than markets are initially thinking.""  Moya added: ""It seems like Wall Street might have to wait until the New Year for the Fed to downshift, which means Bitcoin could be vulnerable to finish the week lower.""

By Sam Reynolds  Hong Kong may be “ready to engage” with the digital assets industry to provide retail investors with a “suitable degree of access to virtual assets,” but the industry still needs to see more details of what this plan entails, says Ripple’s Rahul Advani, the firm’s policy director for APAC.  “The tone has changed slightly,” Advani told CoinDesk.  Previously, Hong Kong authorities had been adamant that investment in virtual assets was only to be the domain of professional (accredited) investors. Sam Bankman-Fried cited this as one of the reasons, alongside COVID-19 restrictions, why FTX moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to the Bahamas last year.  “But I think the statement was very broad,” Advani continued. “What we’re expecting to see next is a consultation from the [Securities and Futures Commission], which will have more specifics on what that permission looks like.”  Advani believes that the “devil is in the details.” There could be all sorts of clauses the SFC throws in, like suitability tests or other types of restrictions on how much you can trade and trading venues such as what Singapore has.  In Singapore, the government is not anti-retail crypto, but it has been “very clear that not all retail investors should be investing in crypto assets,” Advani said, pointing to a recent consultation from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which advocates for suitability tests for investors and restrictions on borrowing to purchase crypto.  “Singapore is ensuring that there are safeguards in place,” he said. “They’ve said that they aren’t going to ban retail participation in crypto because that’s going to move the market offshore. And it's not solving risks.”  Hong Kong vs. Singapore?  While some have argued that the crown for Asia’s crypto hub is a zero-sum, winner-take-all, game. Advani doesn’t agree.  “I don't think it's a question of Singapore versus Hong Kong. I think the market is big enough that both Singapore and Hong Kong can coexist,” he said.  Retail crypto’s rise in Hong Kong doesn’t come at a cost to Singapore. But the question remains, what will that rise look like? For now, everyone is in wait-and-see mode.  “It’s a positive statement that we’ve seen from the Hong Kong government ... We’re waiting to see that consultation.”  Important events  8:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:15 UTC) United States ADP Employment Change (Oct.)  2:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(18:00 UTC) United States Fed's Monetary Policy Statement  6:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(22:00 UTC) Australia S&P Global Services PMI (Oct.)

Plus, dogecoin (DOGE) was the top performer in October among the 150 digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI). Digital asset analysts attributed the big jump in DOGE to Musk’s $44 billion takeover of Twitter – ostensibly tied to speculation that the deal might somehow, eventually, bring value or utility to the Dogecoin blockchain and its eponymous cryptocurrency.

42393765,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAmoh,1667350800,Hong Kong Wants to Be a Crypto Hub Again,"HONG KONG — On Monday, at the opening of Hong Kong FinTech Week, regulators declared the city’s ambitions to be a virtual asset hub. The government announced that it will hold consultations for allowing retail investors to invest on licensed platforms and is open to considering virtual asset futures exchange-traded funds (ETF).  The irony is that Hong Kong, just a few years back, was already a hub. Ask people who’ve been in the crypto scene for a while and they’ll point to how Bitmex had an office, complete with a shark tank, right above the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong’s financial regulator.  Then the SFC started knocking on doors, and exchanges started to worry they’d be punished for listing tokens without getting legal opinions on whether they were securities within the jurisdiction. The costs were prohibitive, as getting a legal opinion could run US$10,000 per token.  The regulator issued warnings about leverage. It introduced an opt-in process whereby virtual asset service providers (VASP) could obtain licenses for dealing in securities and providing automated trading services. It was rigorous. Only two firms heard positive news – BC Group which runs exchange OSL is the only firm to have its licenses, and HashKey Group has an in-principle approval.  And it seemed that once its licensing regime came in and wasn’t opt-in anymore, platforms wouldn’t be able to service retail investors. (In the meantime, retail investors continued to use unlicensed exchanges.)  Across the border, China banned firms offering crypto services. Hong Kong’s politicians insisted that the city was still governed under the “one country two systems principle” – meaning the city is part of China but can organize its own affairs. But firms had doubts that Hong Kong could keep its autonomy when it came to deciding how to regulate crypto. They left in droves for Singapore and other jurisdictions.  COVID-19 restrictions compounded difficulties for businesses. This time last year, Hong Kong had among the toughest Covid-19 rules in place, including a three-week hotel quarantine for those coming to the city. The city hemorrhaged talent. Now, inbound travelers no longer need to quarantine, though they still need to go for tests. The city says it’s back to business as usual. The question is whether businesses and talent will return.  Licensing regime sets high bar  The VASP licensing regime comes into force in March 2023 and applicants will get a nine-month grace period. Hong Kong will not have an opt-in regime anymore. Either exchanges are licensed or they cannot operate in the city.  The VASP regime offers clarity. Without clear regulation, “we were basically self-regulating, benchmarking ourselves against the strictest regulatory standards,” said Amber Group managing partner Annabelle Huang. She added that the company has held itself to the toughest standards of crypto regulation globally in jurisdictions it operates in.  Padraig Walsh, partner at law firm Tanner De Witt, characterizes the proposed regime as bringing Hong Kong up to the expected standards under the Financial Action Task Force. “One of the areas where there was anticipation for progress was in relation to anti-money laundering and [know your customer rules] for virtual assets,” he said.  According to him, Hong Kong’s approach is designed and intended for the long term. The licenses are “not intended for the many, but the few,” he said.  Read more: ‘Crypto and DeFi Won’t Disappear’: Hong Kong Monetary Chief  Market players have expressed that they consider the VASP regime strict, a government source told CoinDesk. They see high operating costs, given a requirement that they insure their assets and hold a high percentage of assets in cold wallets.  Ultimately, the regime’s emphasis is on investor protection, this source said. At this point, it seems to be focused on spot trading, and does not allow staking, lending, copy trading nor the bread-and-butter for many exchanges – leverage. In essence, the SFC doesn’t want to see anything not found in the traditional stock market.  Other jurisdictions have introduced regulation and then made modifications. Singapore, for instance, has signaled to the market that it will ramp up compliance obligations. Hong Kong has set a high bar from the start.  Comparisons  Hong Kong “absolutely lost ground to a couple of neighboring jurisdictions,” HashKey Chief Operating Officer David Leahy said. But in his view, the strength of Hong Kong’s capital markets still make it a dominant force in the region.  “When we talk to the digital asset desks, investment banks, and licensed intermediaries, there is significant demand,” he said.  Hong Kong created “a very detailed set” of regulations for licensed crypto companies, said BC Group Executive Director Gary Tiu. It took the group’s digital platform business OSL more than two years to obtain its licenses from the SFC and start dealing in securities and providing automated trading services.  Tiu said that many people thought Singapore was more crypto-friendly, while Hong Kong was very strict. “The two regimes are starting to converge in the middle,” he said.  Read more: Hong Kong Monetary Authority Invites Views on Retail CBDC  Some investors like its strictness. Tiu said that he sees a lot of non-Hong Kong institutional interests spending a lot of time to understand the Hong Kong platform.  “They believe the Hong Kong regime provides them the right level of protection that they don't see in other places,” he said.  Walsh said there was a period of time, maybe a year ago, where there was a perception that Singapore was forging ahead and Hong Kong wasn’t. “I don’t think that’s the case now,” he said, citing the complexity of Singapore’s application process and the long time taken to process license applications, which even the regulator describes as “painfully slow.”  Open to discussing retail  In January, SFC had said that only professional investors could invest in crypto, meaning individuals or corporations with a portfolio worth upwards of HK$8 million (US$1 million) — and crypto didn’t count.  The industry welcomes the SFC’s willingness to reconsider retail investors and have a public consultation on the subject.  “It’s a great opportunity,” said Leahy of HashKey, which plans to bring its exchange to market in the second quarter of next year.  He’s waiting to hear if listing requirements will be the same for both retail and professional investors, and if the professional investor designation falls away.  “They are very focused on the quality of the projects that are listed on exchanges,” he said of the SFC.  Read more: Hong Kong SFC Should Regulate Crypto, Says Official: Report  If the SFC were to allow retail investors to invest, it would legitimize what is already happening. “If they don’t open to retail, given this asset class is becoming popular, these retail investors will invest through unregulated service providers outside of Hong Kong,” Michael Wong, partner at law firm Dechert, said. “If you regulate it at least you have some control.”  Wong said the SFC may bring in a suitability requirement and have investors fill in questionnaires to show they understand the risk profiles of what they’re buying. SFC-licensed trading platforms may be required to provide hotlines or physical branches to assist retail investors, giving them the chance to complain to the regulator if platforms act dishonestly, he said.  In his view, investors will likely move to regulated exchanges unless the unregulated ones offer them services like lending and staking.  Door open  There are still areas where firms want more clarity. Walsh is waiting for the application guidelines.  “We have enough to be able to assess whether a particular business falls within the scope that needs a license or is outside that perimeter,” he said. “But we don't really have enough to know what they would need to do.”  The licensing regime requires exchanges to have two responsible officers to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing requirements among others. But those with such qualifications may not be familiar with virtual assets, Asia Crypto Alliance co-founder Viven Khoo said. She’s fielded calls from people with this qualification on how they protect themselves when overseeing a business that includes virtual assets.  Read more: Hong Kong Monetary Authority Releases CBDC White Paper to Study Prospect of e-HKD  There is concern that some non-regulated companies may abuse the grace period by submitting an application knowing that they will not be successful, just to be able to max out what they can, she added. Some players in the market are lobbying for moderate restrictions in the interim.  Still, the regime “leaves some room going forward,” Khoo said. “If legislators decide they want to open it more broadly, they don’t need to go through another set of legislative changes.”  If the regime does relax, it will likely be gradual. “The regulator has said they will monitor the first-stage license holders and consider further changes,” the government source told CoinDesk. “If they have no intention to do so, generally they will not say so.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/02/hong-kong-wants-to-be-a-crypto-hub-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a6842454db62ce10559ce1cb1b1ab6ef4700b6f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415091,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXGAt,1667347200,Stablecoin Issuer Paxos Receives Operating License From Singapore Regulator,"Paxos, issuer of the USDP stablecoin, can offer crypto products and services in Singapore after securing the license under the nation's Payment Services Act.  The New York-based company announced the approval early Wednesday (Singapore time), saying in a press release that the license would allow it to offer ""digital asset and blockchain products and services"" to companies headquartered in the nation.  This includes tokenization, custody and trade services, the release said. Paxos is perhaps best known for issuing Paxos dollar (USDP), which currently enjoys a roughly $900 million market capitalization.  The Payment Services Act, a law passed in 2019, regulates payment systems and providers in the country, allowing the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to better oversee these entities, including certain crypto companies.  In a statement, Paxos Asia CEO Rich Teo said the company was one of the first U.S.-based crypto firms to receive the license.  ""From the start, we’ve been committed to innovating within regulatory frameworks,"" he said. ""We believe blockchain and digital assets will revolutionize finance for everyone around the world, but development of this technology must have clear oversight and consumer protections. We’re excited to have MAS as our regulator, and with their oversight, we’ll be able to safely accelerate consumer adoption of digital assets globally in partnership with the world’s biggest enterprises.""  Singapore has promised to crack down on malignant actors, and some companies – like Binance and the now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital – have left the country. Still others hope to continue operations through new licenses.  Crypto exchange Coinbase, also a U.S.-based firm, secured a digital payment token license in Singapore last month, alongside another 17 companies.  MAS, which is also Singapore's central bank, proposed fresh stablecoin rules last week, including setting reserve and capital requirements and a ban on lending and other activities. These proposals are open to public comment through next month.
