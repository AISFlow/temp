42385984,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPZvR,1613774608,"Nyan Cat NFT Sells for 300 ETH, Opening Door to the 'Meme Economy'","An age-old question of how to monetize memes appears to have found an answer. This afternoon, the storied internet sensation, Nyan Cat, sold for 300.00 ETH (about $590,000) in an online auction. It wasn’t the .gif file that was sold, which is still reproducible and found everywhere online, but a cryptographic hash of the psychedelic image on the Ethereum blockchain.      Chris Torres, who created the meme 10 years ago, confirmed the sale and his role in it over email. This was his first experiment with nonfungible tokens (NFTs), a type of digital asset that has taken the crypto scene by storm recently. NFTs, like Bitcoin, are provably scarce and uniquely identifiable. They’ve found application in the world of digital art, as well as more earth-bound industries.      “I am still relatively new to crypto in general, but I see its full potential,” Torres said. The sale took place on the crypto art platform Foundation, which launched just two weeks ago. The auction was open for 24 hours, with bids starting at 3 ETH.      In recent weeks, a number of historical NFTs have sold for hundreds of ETH, like one Crypto Punk variant priced at over $1 million. The NFT-based art market, which has surged with the crypto markets, is now worth over $100 million, with success seen by crypto-native and traditional artists alike.    Read more: Early CryptoPunk Digital Collectible Sells for $762K in Ether    Torres’ sale represents the latest permutation of the NFT industry: codifying and selling bits of the web that seemingly belong to everyone. “I'm very surprised with the success, but I think I'm most glad knowing that I've basically opened the door to a whole new meme economy in the crypto world,” Torres said.      Until now, the creators of memes would often see little recompense for their work. Some scored book deals, others sold t-shirts and merchandise. But there was little reliable way to monetize the idea.      With crypto, any idea can be monetized directly. And so long as the creator's identity can reliably be tied to the work, it presents the most direct way to reward someone for things others enjoy. Plus, the works can be resold on a secondary market, with proceeds continuing to accrue to the artist.      “I feel like that's what it really needed, and it's going to be great seeing how it plays out,” Torres said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/19/nyan-cat-nft-sells-for-300-eth-opening-door-to-the-meme-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14e75972c15e68c7f699c6f6ea5eb76b0213030e-1994x1496.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385989,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPa2z,1613773129,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Briefly Above $56K, Ether Follows BTC’s Rally","Bitcoin broke briefly above a key resistance level at $56,000 on Friday, while ether's slowly catching up to bitcoin's gains.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $55,512.76 as of 22:00 UTC (5 p.m. ET). Gaining 6.60% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $50,821.47-$56,283.55 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Some are attributing the astonishing rise of bitcoin’s price, including a short time above $56,000, to the tremendous demand from buyers looking to hedge against inflation.      “Through the insatiable buy-side pressure from exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers, closed-end funds and large public corporations adding bitcoin to their positions, demand is massively outstripping supply,” said John Willock, chief executive at digital asset exchange Blocktane. “I feel confident that we won’t see a massive crash like post-2017.”      The first publicly traded bitcoin ETF in North America, managed by Canada-based Purpose Investments, saw an impressive $165 million worth trading volume on its first day of trading, well above a typical Day One for a Canadian ETF. (TradeBlock, a CoinDesk subsidiary, is the index provider of Purpose Investments’ bitcoin ETF.)      Read More: North America’s First Bitcoin ETF Hits $165M Trade Volume in First Day      Yet, there are still several psychological barriers for bitcoin to break, even as it passed a key milestone of $1 trillion in market capitalization.      While the 10-figure market cap potentially makes bitcoin go from “a magic internet money meme” into a largely recognized investment asset, it also poses some psychological challenges to some buyers, who may sell some bitcoin for profit taking.      Read More: Bitcoin’s Price Surge Accelerates After Passing Milestone of $1T Market Value      In the derivatives market, bitcoin’s price could be tested at around $56,000, according toAndrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier.      “Based on options open interest, it looks like $56,000 is the next big resistance,” Tu said.      Some are taking it a step further. Michael Burry, “The Big Short” investor and founder of the Scion Asset Management, said in a now deleted tweet, “In an inflationary crisis, governments will move to squash competitors in the currency arena,” adding “$BTC #gold” to the end of the tweet.      However, while many bought into bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, physical gold has lost value year to date while bitcoin has skyrocketed.    Ether near $2K, DeFi drives Binance’s BNB    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday, trading around $1,951.37 and climbing 0.63% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      With ether’s new all-time high could be seen as a result of bitcoin’s surge, factors such as institutional interest and rapid growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) have also been moving its price higher.      But much of the chatter in the altcoin market is centered on BNB, the native token to Binance, the No. 1 cryptocurrency exchange by spot trading volume. BNB saw a seven-fold return on a year-to-day basis and its market capitalization has passed that of the stablecoin tether (USDT) to take third place behind bitcoin and ether.      Read More: BNB Gains 45% in 24 Hours as PancakeSwap ‘Flippens’ Uniswap Volume      BNB’s explosion is likely a result of an extraordinary growth in PancakeSwap, a DeFi project based on Binance’s Binance Smart Chain.

42385988,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPZzD,1613772922,Ideamarket Is a Literal Marketplace for Ideas (and Online Reputation),"With Facebook cutting news from its platform for Australians and most Americans having lost trust in media, the search for reliable information has sent many down the halls of Reddit, YouTube and other social media platforms.      Credibility is hard to find. But one Los Angeles-based startup is providing what it argues are objective rankings of information distributors. Built on Ethereum, Ideamarket launched this week and lets users put their money behind social media accounts they deem important.      In essence, it’s a manifestation of the generally amorphous “marketplace of ideas.”      “Ideamarket is an entirely new income stream for creators, without dependence on ads or paywalls,” said founder Mike Elias. “Our goal is to liberate journalism from paywalls by giving [journalists and creators] an income stream dependent only on the trust they earn from their audience. This rewards journalists for publishing their best work for free, without paywalls.”      It’s not just journalists, though. Some of the top-ranking accounts on the site include Elon Musk comfortably at #1 for Twitter accounts, with Soulja Boy coming in at #8. In between those two, at #5, is the @potus account of President Joe Biden.      Thus far, Ideamarket has attracted over $1 million in deposits to the site.    How Ideamarket works    Ideamarket functions somewhat similarly to Reddit, in which people can upvote various media brands, journalists and, really, any post that they think has online credibility. But instead of having no cost, like an upvote, Ideamarket lets users buy tokens (think of it like stock) in a social media account they deem valuable and reputable.      As described in a previous article, upvotes ""cost money and increase in cost as vote count increases, meaning that people have to put their money where their mouth, or itchy retweeting trigger finger, is.”      So, say you wanted to add Twitter account @johndoe to Ideamarket and buy tokens in that account. First you would have to go to the site and click on the button to “Add Listing.” You could then add that account.      Ideamarket encourages people, when listing an account, to buy tokens in it when they do. This is because the first 1,000 tokens for each listing cost $0.10 each but then automatically increase by $0.01 after every 100 tokens bought henceforth. These increases are managed by a bonding curve algorithm.      To buy or sell a token, you click on the trade button.      You then choose to pay with crypto or a credit card. For a credit card, there would be instructions to create a Portis crypto wallet. Then, use the dropdown menu to choose what currency to pay in. If you’re paying with a credit card, DAI is recommended. You then enter the amount you want to purchase and click buy. So after adding @johndoe, for example, you could pay $1 for ten tokens of @johndoe.    Read more: Jack Dorsey Has Floated Decentralized Fact-Checking at Twitter. Here’s What That Could Look Like    According to a document overview of the site, “money spent on tokens is held in Compound.Finance, a decentralized lending protocol. Compound lends these deposits to borrowers, who pay interest (usually 1%-10% annually).”      All interest generated by token deposits is paid to the owner of the associated social media account, and anyone can add an account to the platform.      Essentially, you buy tokens in accounts you think are “attention-worthy"" or have a reputation you'd like to support. You can later sell these tokens down the line if you choose. You can also lock your tokens for a certain amount of time, signaling long-term confidence in the account and that you won’t just sell as soon as other people purchase. As the price of the token rises you can sell at a profit if you choose, and the account earns interest which can be collected by its owner.      It’s not just the content creators who get paid; platforms get a new income stream as well.    Read more: In Trump Versus Twitter, Decentralized Tech May Win    For each transaction, there is a 1% fee, half of which goes to the platform and half of which goes to Ideamarket.      Currently, the platforms listed on Ideamarket are Twitter and Substack. Twitter currently has accrued over $6,000 that it has yet to claim, while Substack has not yet breached $75 at the time of writing.    New developments since the beta    There are two big differences from the beta of Ideamarket that was launched in November 2019. Originally, said Elias, it was going to rank web domains, like http://wsj.com and http://cnn.com “Now, we're ranking social media accounts, like @balajis and @joerogan,” he said.      All interest generated by deposits on tokens gets paid to the account owners.      “We see ourselves as ‘Chainlink for public narratives.’ We're not dependent on any particular social media platform,” said Elias. “Instead, we're available for any public square that develops to plug into.”    Read more: Prediction Markets’ Time Has Come, but They Aren’t Ready for It    According to Elias, Ideamarket’s main goal is to relieve social media platforms of the “impossible task of making epistemic judgments on behalf of the public.” He said Ideamarket is a protocol for risk-backed content moderation, and that by measuring credibility in dollars, ""fake news"" becomes permanently and increasingly more expensive.      “Now, in addition to creating a newsy-looking website, they have to buy a market rank similar to the trusted publications they're trying to imitate,” he said.      While Ideamarket is listing social media accounts on various platforms, news organizations’ accounts like those of the New York Times or Fox News could also be added if users decided to do so.      Like any existing market, Elias concedes, there’s no way to explicitly prevent private interests from artificially boosting a listing and in theory their online credibility. For example, I could list myself and then pay to boost my own ranking.      “However, parties that buy a high rank are paying out of pocket for something trusted voices crowdsource ‘for free,’” said Elias. “They’re also competing against the buying power of entire populations. Ideamarket is a new income stream for trusted voices, and a constantly growing expense for propagandists.”    Gas fees a hurdle    Like all things Ethereum right now, high gas fees are the biggest challenge Ideamarket is facing. Given the Ethereum-wide demand, gas fees are often over $100 per transaction.      Ideamarket CTO Alexander Schlindwein is now working on a plan, which originally came from Ideamarket investor Felix Hartmann. If it works, Schlindwein’s plan will reduce gas fees for buys denominated in DAI by about 40%.    Read more: How Crypto Transforms Prediction Markets    “We're also entertaining creative solutions, such as decentralized index funds from Enzyme Finance,” said Elias. “This would allow influencers to create Ideamarket indexes and crowdsource funds from small investors, who would then gain exposure to multiple Ideamarket tokens while only sending one transaction (to buy into the index fund).”      The staying power for the platform will depend upon, yes, gas fees, as well as overall interest and buy-in, to ensure the rankings can’t be swayed by a small group of individuals, for example. But it’s one more tool for consumers to navigate the fractured and insular online world of information, and for content providers to make some money along the way.",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | DAI,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/19/ideamarket-is-a-literal-marketplace-for-ideas-and-online-reputation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92a2113e8055c5eadc14add704bc5d25d48088fe-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385991,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPa1j,1613758372,Money Reimagined: Tucker Carlson Is Right About Financial Privacy,"Welcome to Money Reimagined.      I’m on vacation. So this week’s main-bar column comes to you from Executive Editor Marc Hochstein. In it, Marc draws deeply on his objective consistency to remind us that wherever you stand on the politically charged issues of our day, we all lose when our right to privacy is breached in pursuit of them.      Before I took two days off, my podcast co-host Sheila Warren and I got to record the first in a multi-part series on the nonfungible token craze. To explore why people in the art and entertainment world are so excited about NFTs right now, this week’s stage-setting episode starts with a look at how human beings decide how to value something.      For this, we were joined by perhaps the perfect guest: Nanne Dekking, the former vice chairman of Sotheby’s who is now the CEO of blockchain company Artory. This was an especially fun one! Check it out after reading Marc’s insights.      – Michael Casey    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.  Bank of America: World police    Trigger warning: This column has something nice to say about Tucker Carlson.      On Feb. 4, the Fox News host broke a story that should concern all Americans, even those who normally blanch at his populist brand of right-wing politics. Indeed, the revelations should interest anyone who cares about the future of money, even if Carlson’s TV broadcast could have used more context.      Since the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill riot in Washington, D.C., Bank of America has been helping federal investigators search for extremists by combing through its transaction records, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” reported, without naming its sources (standard journalistic practice with sensitive stories).      Specifically, the country’s second-largest bank searched for customers who:    Transacted with debit or credit cards in Washington on Jan. 5 and 6  Paid for hotel or AirBnB reservations in the area after Jan. 6  Bought weapons, or anything else (“t-shirts included”) from a “weapons-related merchant,” between Jan. 7 and “their upcoming suspected stay in D.C. area around Inauguration Day” (Jan. 20)  Made “airline-related purchases” after Jan. 6 – “not just flights to Washington, but flights anywhere, from Omaha to Thailand.”    Of the 211 customers who met the “thresholds of interest,” at least one was interviewed by the authorities before being cleared of suspicion, Carlson told his more than 4 million nightly viewers.      “Bank of America is, without the knowledge or the consent of its customers, sharing private information with federal law enforcement agencies,” he thundered. “Bank of America effectively is acting as an intelligence agency, but they're not telling you about it.”    What else is new?    To seasoned observers of the financial services industry, including regulated cryptocurrency businesses, it’s tempting to scoff, “no kidding, Columbo.”      Banks have been providing customers’ private information to the government without their knowledge or consent for decades under the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act and related anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations.      “For B of A, as well as any other regulated entity, it’s not like we’re sheriff deputies or an extension of law enforcement, but because we’re regulated, we have regulatory obligations. That’s how the regulatory framework was designed by our legislature and politicians,” said Tim Byun, global government relations officer at crypto exchange operator OK Group and a former Visa executive and bank examiner. “The public and customers should and need to be aware of this.”      Read more: Why Ledger Kept All That Customer Data      Financial institutions routinely file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports (SARs and CTRs), hundreds of thousands each year, to the Treasury Department. These reports contain sensitive personal information about customers who may not have committed any crime. As CoinDesk’s Ben Powers reported last year, they are stored indefinitely by a bureau that appears ill-equipped to guard them. A trove of them would make a comely prize for hackers. The SolarWinds breach only reinforced doubts about Uncle Sam’s cyber defenses.      After 9/11, the Patriot Act heightened banks’ “intelligence agency” role decried by Carlson. Particularly pertinent here may be Section 314(a), which authorizes the government to share with financial institutions the names, addresses and other data about individuals and groups suspected of terrorist and money laundering activity, and in turn requires those firms to search their records and tell the authorities if they find a match.      On Fox, Carlson asked his viewers to put themselves in the shoes of the B of A customer. “The FBI hauls you in for questioning in a terror investigation, not because you've done anything suspicious, but because you bought plane tickets and visited your country's capital,” he said. “Now they're sweating you because your bank, which you trust with your most private information, has ratted you out without your knowledge.”    Don’t tell a soul    Carlson’s indignation is understandable – but so would any bank’s reticence to notify customers they were being “ratted out.” Tipping off a customer to an investigation by disclosing a SAR filing, for example, is illegal, and both the bank and the officer responsible may be held liable for doing so. (Don't believe me? See title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations, sections 5318 (g) (2), 5321 and 5322.)      “All banks have responsibilities under federal law to cooperate with law enforcement inquiries in full compliance with the law,"" B of A noted in its response to Carlson’s questions.      Some details of Carlson’s report were fuzzy. For example, he complained that B of A cast “an absurdly wide net,” but it’s not clear how absurdly wide. The broadcast didn’t explicitly say whether the bank reported only those customers who met all four of the criteria described, or all who satisfied any one of them.      Read more: Marc Hochstein - Who Are the Real Monsters?      Also, while Carlson noted that B of A retrieved the information “at the request of federal investigators,” it would be helpful to know the exact nature of the request: a warrant backed by probable cause and signed by a judge? A subpoena? An order by the shadowy, Kafkaesque FISA court? (Neither Fox News nor B of A answered requests for clarification by press time.)      Here’s where the Patriot Act may come into play. Did B of A search its records in response to a Section 314(a) notification? If so, was this tool used because the suspects were considered domestic terrorists? (Remember, the law was written when the popular idea of a terrorist was Osama Bin Laden, not the QAnon Shaman.)      Does a search for broad types of purchases, rather than named individuals, fall under the scope of Section 314(a)? How much leeway did B of A have to push back against the Feds’ demands, as Carlson implies it should have? Was law enforcement simply looking to supplement information already gleaned from public video footage, names to put to faces? It’ll be interesting to see what further reporting finds.      But remember the big picture. Since the 1970s, courts in the U.S. have held that people have no reasonable expectation of privacy in information they voluntarily turn over to third parties. As a result, the investigative methods Carlson exposed, however shocking to Joe Sixpack, are pretty standard. Our financial transactions aren’t protected by the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.      Should they be? That’s a question we ought to revisit in this digital age. Say what you will about Tucker Carlson, but he deserves credit for drawing public attention to the matter.      – Marc Hochstein    Ethereum's whales    Signs of ownership concentration are emerging on the Ethereum network as participation grows in Ethereum 2.0's stake-based validation system. The number of ether ""millionaires,"" or addresses holding 1,000 ETH or more, has dropped by 7% in 2021, as of Thursday, accelerating from 2020's 6% annual decline, according to data provided by Coin Metrics.      Meanwhile, at more whalish depths, populations are increasing. The number of addresses holding 10,000 units or more has increased by 8%, and Ethereum has added a single new ""billionaire."" Since the start of the year, the number of addresses holding 1 million ETH or more has gone from seven, to nine, and back to eight as of Thursday.      Let's be clear, these aren't uncharted waters for ether ownership concentration. The number of 10,000 ETH addresses hit peak in February, 2018, at 1,284. As of Thursday, it's 1,276.      These shifts in ownership are taking place as staking grows on Ethereum, with 90,349 active validators on the network, up from 77,890 at the beginning of February, according to CoinDesk's Valid Points newsletter, which provides in-depth coverage of the Ethereum 2.0 roll-out.      Fears of ownership concentration in proof-of-stake systems are not new. And it's a little early for ETH bears to sound the decentralization alarm. For one thing, these are addresses. They don't even necessarily indicate entities, let alone what kind of entities. They could be exchanges or other service providers representing many smaller entities. However, with Ethereum governance set to be tied to asset ownership in a proof-of-stake system, they bear watching.      – Galen Moore, CoinDesk senior research analyst    The Conversation: Bitcoin’s energy    With bitcoin’s price rise pushing crypto back into mainstream conversation, Twitter alighted on a long-simmering question this week. Is bitcoin’s energy consumption – inevitably high because of its proof-of-work algorithm and decentralization – justifiable?      Meteorologist and climate journalist Eric Holthaus said it this way:      But Yassine Elmandjra, an Ark Invest analyst, said a lot of bitcoin mining uses renewables these days:      CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter said bitcoin’s climate scolds fail to account for the dollar’s own impact:      And some said BTC could even restore stability to Texas’ troubled grid, with mining facilities (“bitcoin batteries”) helping to balance supply and demand:      Meanwhile, lawyer Jake Chervinsky said bitcoin was healthier for criticism:      – Ben Schiller, Features editor    Relevant reads: Adoption everywhere    Bidding up. In another sign of mainstream crypto acceptance, Christie’s is auctioning its first nonfungible token. ""EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS,"" by @beeple, is the “first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house.” CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley reports.      Meme message. Dogecoin, which has seen year-to-date returns of about 1,000%, is often seen as a big joke. But in this op-ed, CoinDesk Global Macro Editor Emily Parker asks us to take the project seriously, if only because of what it tells us about the moment. Increasingly, she says, reality seems to be “shaped by collective belief, rather than underlying facts.” In other words, if a community wants a coin’s price to rise, it will rise, irrespective of fundamentals.

42385987,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPa0T,1613756480,Bitcoin Is Worth $1T and OKCoin Delists BCH and BSV,"This article is excerpted from Blockchain Bites, a daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    $1T Bitcoin is a trillion-dollar asset. The first and largest cryptocurrency set a new high of $53,739.48 Friday morning, the magic number at which the market value of all bitcoins in circulation is worth $1 trillion. This is up from a $178 billion market capitalization last year, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports.      While in some sense a meaningless event, it is also a serious milestone on the path for bitcoin to become a significant part of the global financial ecosystem. The open protocol is now more valuable than Facebook, and could soon overtake Alphabet, Google’s parent, or Amazon if prices continue to rise.      In February 2011, just two years and one month after the Bitcoin “genesis block” was mined, the cryptocurrency hit dollar parity, or the moment when one BTC could be exchanged for $1. This was an important psychological event, proving that bitcoin wasn’t just a usable currency, but a viable, alternative monetary system.      “[I]t's like going from kids playing an early version of a game on the street with sticks and rocks, to 10 years later it being the fastest-growing, most important, most impactful game that's taking over the sports world,” CoinDesk podcast editor Adam B. Levine, an early adopter, told Blockchain Bites.      “Initial viability is important. Mainstream acceptance is important,” he said. Institutions are rapidly entering the bitcoin economy at a moment when the U.S. dollar’s longevity has never been more in question.      Indeed, the trillion dollar sign post may signal a future where a dollar price quote for bitcoin hardly matters. It’s unlikely the entire global economy is denominated in satoshis – even less so in “bits” – but bitcoin could become a viable global reserve asset. Not just sitting on disruptors like MicroStrategy or Tesla’s balance sheets, some predict a world where governments hold.      As Michael Venuto of Toroso Asset Management said this morning on CoinDesk TV, “[Bitcoin’s] price is more or less a meme. It gets people excited but perhaps for the wrong reasons, preventing them from going down the rabbit hole.”    Other stories    CeFi and DeFi paddycakes PancakeSwap is the latest automated market maker (AMM) clone looking to unseat Uniswap as the top DeFi trading platform. The protocol is developed by Binance and offers reprieve to soaring gas prices on the Ethereum-based original. Liquidity, volumes and the price of its native CAKE token are skyrocketing, perhaps to the ire of stone-cold Ethereum stans.    Binance coin (BNB), a token developed for use across the exchange’s suite of products, is now the third-largest coin by market capitalization. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has long been a prominent of “CeDeFi,” or decentralized finance with centralized characteristics.    This exchange ain’t big enough ... OKCoin is delisting bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) to prevent new customers from confusing these two forks for bitcoin (BTC). “This is not an easy decision. We had a choice and there is collateral damage, but we had to stand up for the bigger principle we believe in,” OKCoin CEO Hong Fang told CoinDesk. Bitcoin Cash is a clone of Bitcoin, with minor adjustments to increase block sizes. BSV, championed by Craig Wright, known for his claims to be the inventor of the original Bitcoin, is itself a fork of Bitcoin Cash. CoinDesk tech reporter Colin Harper dives in.      Systemically important: bank says Bitcoin, and the wider crypto market, could face a severe liquidity shock if traders lost faith in tether (USDT), according to JPMorgan analysts. In a new report, bank analyst played catch-up to the interminable tether conversation, saying the dollar-equivalent stablecoin’s implosure could trigger a bank run-like event. There are more than $33 billion USDT in existence, up from $4 billion just 12 months ago.

At press time, bitcoin was trading at $54,646.46, up 5.30% in the past 24 hours. It is only slightly down from the new all-time high at $54,711.32      “In many ways, $1 trillion marks an interesting focal point in which bitcoin goes from a magic internet money meme into a Wall Street, institutionally recognized and investable asset,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier.      At the same time, bitcoin’s one-month implied volatility – investors’ expectation of how turbulent prices will be over the next four weeks - also dropped on Friday, according to data source Skew.      “The bulls have taken hold of the markets,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital assets prime broker Bequant.      Many factors in the past week have contributed to bitcoin’s latest rally, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pushing the Biden Administration's proposal of $1.9 trillion stimulus package, MicroStrategy’s announcement it is boosting its bitcoin stash again and money manager BlackRock’s “dabbling” in cryptocurrency.      While every piece of news seems to benefit bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole, some are warning about potential risks of people taking profits and pushing down bitcoin's price.      “With traders appearing to now expect announcements like these to keep coming, we may see a pullback in the near future, perhaps this weekend,” Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director at eToro, said. “It would not be surprising to see bitcoin drop briefly below $50,000 while some people and firms lock in profits before another run above this all-important psychological level.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/19/bitcoins-price-surge-accelerates-after-passing-milestone-of-1t-market-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3387f12056342cdc87f3c3394eb41403326847e-1200x614.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385967,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPWYb,1613747005,First Mover: Bitcoin Meets 'Torrent' as Lowly Binance Coin Gets $40B Valuation,"Price Point    Bitcoin (BTC) pushed higher on Friday to a new all-time-high price, stopping just shy of $53,000. At the current level of outstanding bitcoin supplies, a move above $53,665 would push the largest cryptocurrency's market capitalization to the $1 trillion mark, seen as a milestone in bitcoin's maturation as a global asset.      Signs continued to mount that bitcoin is seeing increased mainstream adoption - or at least mainstream attention from the likes of the giant bank JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the bond-investing legend Jeff Gundlach. (See Bitcoin Watch, below.)      But bitcoin perhaps wasn't even be the biggest story this week in digital-asset markets. Binance coin (BNB), the in-house in-house token from the similarly named cryptocurrency exchange, has soared this month to a $40 billion market capitalization, ranking it third among all digital assets behind bitcoin and Ethereum's ether (ETH).      In traditional markets, European shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open. Gold slid 0.2% to $1,772 an ounce.    The News    PAY YOUR SWISS TAXES IN BTC: The Swiss canton of Zug – dubbed “Crypto Valley” thanks to the many digital-asset companies drawn to the jurisdiction because of its friendly blockchain and crypto regulation – has started accepting tax payments in cryptocurrency. For now, there’s a cap of 100,000 Swiss francs ($111,300). “As the home of the Crypto Valley, it is important to us to further promote and simplify the use of cryptocurrencies in everyday life,” said Zug’s finance director, Heinz Tannler, when the tax initiative was announced.      BIDDERS UP: Christie’s, the 255-year-old auction house of art, antiques and apparently meterorites, will now accept cryptocurrency for payment, Bloomberg reported. “That Christie’s is willing to accept cryptocurrency for the first time,” according to the piece, “says more about the auction house’s attempt to break into new audiences than it does about a shift in the traditional art market.”    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin beating gold where it counts right now - on the inflation trade      Bitcoin continues to outshine gold amid calls for more fiscal spending to boost the U.S. economy back to full strength.      The world’s biggest cryptocurrency set a new record price of $52,954.49 on Friday, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole reported, having scaled the $50,000 mark two days prior. Meanwhile, gold fell to $1,760 early Friday to hit the lowest level since July.      Bitcoin's potential use as a hedge against inflation, and possibly a better one than gold, has become a key narrative on Wall Street as well as in Washington.      In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package could help the U.S. get back to full employment in a year, a sign that President Joe Biden's administration is undaunted in pushing for a large bill. She added that the risk associated with delivering too little stimulus is greater than the price of doing something big.      But she added that bitcoin is a ""highly speculative asset.""      Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of the $130 billion DoubleLine Capital and one of the world's most renowned bond investors, tweeted Thursday that he was a ""long-term dollar bear"" and that bitcoin was ""maybe the Stimulus Asset"" and that it ""doesn't look like gold is."" Gundlach previously had said he didn't believe in bitcoin.      ""Lots of liquid poured into a funnel creates a torrent,"" Gundlach wrote in the tweet.      Analysts for JPMorgan wrote in an 86-page report that bitcoin's ""competition with gold as an 'alternative' currency is here to stay,"" though they called it an ""economic sideshow"" in that ""the rise of digital finance is the real post-Covid-19 story.""      Bill Gates, the Microsoft-founder-turned-philanthropist, said he's neutral, notable perhaps because he didn't immediately pan it, as some other successful U.S. business people have done, later to miss out on big market gains. (Looking at you, Warren Buffett.)      ""The past couple of weeks have seen fundamental arguments made for choosing silver, bitcoin, and Treasuries over gold,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange broker OANDA. ""Bitcoin has benefited from relentless retail demand and on expectations that institutional interest is still growing.""    Market Moves    Binance coin shoots to $40B valuation, trailing only bitcoin and ether      While cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's valuation soars to a $77 billion valuation based on private-share trading, rival Binance is seeing rocketing demand for its exchange tokens in digital-asset markets.      Prices for the BNB tokens have jumped five-fold this month, for a market value of about $40 billion. According to Messari, that valuation makes Binance coin the third-biggest digital asset after bitcoin and Ethereum's ether.      The token serves as Binance's internal currency: It can be used to buy cryptocurrencies on the exchange and pay fees. So the jump in BNB's price might reflect speculation that Binance, already one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, will occupy a dominant role in the future of fast-growing digital-asset markets.      According to CoinDesk's Sebastian Sinclair, the price rise might be tied to increased interest in a decentralized financial application called PancakeSwap, which helps users find yield-earning opportunities in crypto markets. PancakeSwap runs on Binance's own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain.      Daily volumes on PancakeSwap have shot up to more than $1 billion, from $37 million at the start of the year, CoinDesk's Will Foxley reported.      The BNB token is needed to process transactions on the Binance Smart Chain, similar to the way ether is used on the Ethereum blockchain.      For what it's worth, the BNB token itself is set atop the Ethereum blockchain, under the common ERC-20 standard for digital tokens.      That helps explain why a tokenized or ""synthetic"" version of the BNB token, called wrapped BNB (WBNB), appears to be the primary token traded on PancakeSwap within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem, according to CoinGecko, a crypto-markets tracking site:    Opinions and Observations    DEFI AT $400 BILLION?

42385957,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPWNH,1613746800,"OKCoin Delists Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV to Avoid ‘Misleading’ New Bitcoin Clients","OKCoin is delisting bitcoin cash (BCH), a fork or “clone” of bitcoin, as well as its own fork, bitcoin sv (BSV), both as a way to protect neophyte clients who are trying to buy bitcoin and as a statement of principle.      Shared exclusively with CoinDesk before Friday’s announcement, the exchange’s higher-ups decided to scuttle the markets for either coin because they created confusion for new clients who joined OKCoin to buy bitcoin.      On top of that, the routine lawsuits and legal threats from Bitcoin SV creator Craig Wright played a hand in the exchange decision to delist both BCH and BSV.      “This is not an easy decision. We had a choice and there is collateral damage, but we had to stand up for the bigger principle we believe in,” OKCoin CEO Hong Fang told CoinDesk, adding that OKCoin’s team tries to not let their “opinions color their decision making.”      Still, Craig Wright’s most recent legal crusade against developers who host Bitcoin’s white paper was a breaking point. For Fang, it became a choice between protecting Bitcoin’s open source ethos or championing free-market fundamentals.      In the end, community won out.      “On the one hand we feel very strongly about protecting the open-source ethos, but on the other, if we do something about it, that would conflict with our principle of being a neutral platform. We wouldn't have changed that if it weren't for Craig Wright posting these threats to the open-source dev community. We think these threats are very destructive to development and Bitcoin as a whole,” Fang told CoinDesk.      Additionally, these coins bear bitcoin’s name and that has “caused a lot of confusion about what is the real bitcoin among new entrants,” Fang expressed.      “When we have all three on the platform and we have new clients onboarding, most are coming [to buy] bitcoin as a store of value. But when they see BSV and BCH they get confused.""      Bitcoin Cash is a “fork” of Bitcoin, meaning it was created by copying and tweaking Bitcoin’s code, which was birthed out of the so-called scaling or block size wars.      In August 2017, after the SegWit2x block size increase failed to pass muster with the Bitcoin community, former Bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver forked Bitcoin to create Bitcoin Cash. Two years later in November of 2019, Craig Wright and others forked Bitcoin Cash to create Bitcoin SV, which had even larger blocks than its predecessor.    Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV: A history of contention    The confusion Fang speaks to has long been a frustration of the Bitcoin community.      Bitcoin.com, for instance, is run by Bitcoin Cash promoter and progenitor Roger Ver, and for some time the website’s “Buy Bitcoin” button directed patrons to a page where they could instead buy bitcoin cash.      Bitcoin proponents see this chicanery as a sort of attack on Bitcoin. They also argue that Bitcoin SV poses a similar threat.      As such, it became something of a symbolic gesture in 2019 to delist bitcoin sv. Plenty of popular exchanges like Kraken, Binance, ShapeShift and others made the move; many or all of those same exchanges, though, still list bitcoin cash.      In January, Australian exchange Independent Reserve delisted bitcoin sv, citing Wright’s copyright suit threats against those who host Bitcoin’s white paper. (Wright has long proclaimed yet failed to prove that he is Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.)      It’s Fang’s hope that, in light of Wright’s recent actions, more industry leaders will step up and denounce what has become a thorn in the side of the entire industry.      “We call for other members of the community to protect the spirit of free and open source development and decentralization,"" she said.

Cryptocurrency's viability as an investment may not be in its value as an asset but in the way the financial world is evolving because of it, the influential column argues.      The 40% rise in PayPal's share price since it introduced its crypto service is an example of how crypto can ""move the needle"" in the financial system and how investors can profit without actually gaining direct exposure, the column's author, Telos Demos, argues.      Rather than buying cryptocurrency itself, investors may instead look to firms who facilitate the buying and selling of crypto. Coinbase's $77 billion valuation ahead of its public may appear particularly enticing.      The column points to another example in the surging shares of Silvergate Capital, the price of which has risen more than 100% in 2021. Silvergate, which serves crypto firms as a core part of its business, enjoyed a huge increase in customer deposits in the second half of 2020, though analysts have questioned the extent to which this is sustainable in the longer term.

42385951,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPWET,1613741260,"A Sudden Loss of Faith in Tether Would Pose Risk to Bitcoin, JPMorgan Says","According to analysts at JPMorgan, the bitcoin market could face severe liquidity shock if traders were to lose faith in tether (USDT) – a stablecoin widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases.      ""If any issues arise that could affect the willingness or ability of both domestic and foreign investors to use USDT, the most likely result would be a severe liquidity shock to the broader cryptocurrency market, which could be amplified by its disproportionate impact on HFT [high-frequency trading]-style market makers which dominate the flow,"" analysts at JPMorgan mentioned in an 86-page report published Thursday.      Tether's value is linked to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis, and the stablecoin is backed by reserves, including ""traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by the Tether issuing company to third parties, which may include affiliated entities,"" according to the company's official website.      USDT's market capitalization has increased from $4 billion to over $33 billion in the past 12 months – a sign of its increasing use as a funding currency. According to data collected by asset manager NYDIG and cited by JPMorgan analysts, around 50%-60% of bitcoin traded for USDT since 2019.      Hence, a sudden loss of confidence in tether could end up triggering the crypto version of a bank run, destabilizing exchanges and causing a panic drop in bitcoin's price. A bank run occurs when many depositors withdraw their money at the same time over concerns of the bank's solvency.      While tether functions like a traditional bank, it's worth noting that it is not subject to a strict supervisory and disclosure regime as conventional banks. According to the analysts, the company hasn't produced an independent audit yet, and concerns regarding reserves and finances linger, posing a tail risk to the bitcoin market.    See also: Tether’s Bank Deltec Says Stablecoin Is Fully Backed by Reserves    Tether, the company behind the tether stablecoin, has been long criticized for its lack of transparency about reserves and its way of issuing new coins. So far, however, the crypto market hasn't paid much heed to such concerns.      Part of that lack of heed may stem from the fact that during the price rally seen over the past 12 months, U.S. dollar-based trades have been, on average, larger than USDT-based trades, according to Kaiko Research. As such, the risk of a big price crash on the potential loss of confidence in tether appears low.

42385965,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPWXL,1613732060,Bitcoin Tops $55K for First Time While Gold Drops to 7.5-Month Low as Stimulus Calls Grow,"Bitcoin continues to outshine gold amid calls for more fiscal spending to boost the U.S. economy back to full strength.      The world's biggest cryptocurrency set a record price of $55,707.21 on Friday before settling back to $54,898.62, up 5.6% over the last 24 hours, having scaled the $50,000 mark two days prior, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Meanwhile, gold fell to $1,760 a troy ounce early Friday, its lowest level since July 6, 2020, per TradingView.      In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package could help the U.S. get back to full employment in a year. She added that the risk associated with delivering too little stimulus is greater than the cost of doing something big. The Federal Reserve and the U.S. government have already pumped massive liquidity (dollars) into the system over the past 11 months to support the ailing economy.  Increased fiscal spending is generally viewed as leading to inflation. Both gold and bitcoin, with their constrained supplies, are considered hedges against inflation, and so both tend to thrive in the face of more government spending or money-printing by central banks.      But that's not what's happening now. Gold, a classic store of value asset, is nursing losses at press time, while bitcoin is extending its bull run. Since August, the two assets have mostly moved in opposite directions, convincing the likes of payments company MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor that the cryptocurrency is a better inflation hedge than gold. The business intelligence firm has used a significant part of its treasury reserves to invest in bitcoin.      The divergence between the two has become pronounced since the start of the year, with bitcoin charting a steep rise from $30,000 to $52,000 and gold falling from $1,951 to $1,760. That has triggered speculation that bitcoin is rallying at the expense of gold.      Traditional market analysts are associating gold's losses with the rise in the U.S. treasury yields. The 10-year yield set an 11-month high of 1.33% on Wednesday and has gained more than 35 basis points this year. With authorities calling for more spending, yields could continue to rise, keeping gold under pressure.      If the rally in bond yields continues, it could wind up hurting bitcoin as well as gold. First, it could trigger a rotation of money out of equities and into bonds. The resulting decline in the stock markets and the strength in the U.S. dollar could pull bitcoin lower.      Further, momentum funds that bought bitcoin as a store of value asset may sell if real or inflation-adjusted yields rise, as discussed earlier this week.      Also, additional bearish pressure may arise from the drop in the the global stock of negative-yielding debt. The tally has declined by $3 trillion this year to below $15 trillion – the lowest since September. A negative-yielding bond offers less money at maturity than the original buying price. Investors typically turn toward store of value assets such as gold and bitcoin when the number of bonds offering negative yields is rising.      Bitcoin's rally picked up the pace in the final quarter of 2020 as the global stockpile of negative-yielding bonds reached record highs above $18 trillion.

Sebley said the BCB Treasury service includes a lot of education, but in terms of the platform all the components were already in place.      “It was almost a marketing exercise for us,” Sebley added. “We use the trading desk to trade in and out of crypto for them, we custody it and help them report and manage their treasury with accounting tailored to each CFO’s needs.”      Without naming any names, Sebley said BCB’s early conversations about bitcoin were mainly involving U.S. fintech firms. In the last month this has spread to Europe and now includes mid-sized and large-cap companies of every stripe, including import/export businesses, Middle Eastern businesses and also very high-net-worth individuals.

This Firm Is Helping Businesses Save in Bitcoin    “Many firms are in the discovery phase and some are just onboarding,” said Sebley. “So the kicker in terms of bitcoin price action I think we are yet to see.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/19/uk-trading-firm-bcb-launches-bitcoin-treasury-service-for-crypto-curious-cfos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0992f2e7c24472ea710eb4b666c1ea585d1632c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
