42432297,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBsHh,1594856906,Twitter Breach Reactions: Security Professionals Offer an Early Assessment,"@jack's been pwned.      All of Twitter went ablaze Wednesday afternoon as major crypto accounts started tweeting they had partnered with a phony site called ""Crypto For Health"" on a giveaway of 5,000 BTC.      It was a scam, but one that was able to reach the biggest accounts on Twitter, including that of former President Barack Obama, the most followed account in the world.      Read more: Everything We Know About the Bitcoin Scam Rocking Twitter’s Most Prominent Accounts      Security pros contacted by CoinDesk had a wide array of opinions on the breach, but they all agreed the fault did not lie with each hacked account's owner. They said the breach was likely from either third-party apps plugged into people's Twitter accounts or from within the social media giant itself.      ""Whatever the root cause will end up being, this amount of total pwnage would say to me that this is something novel and mass exploitable, not something well known and targeted,"" Erik Cabetas, managing partner at Include Security, told CoinDesk in an email.      Cabetas and Frans Rosén, another security professional from a firm in Europe called Detectify, pointed CoinDesk to this tweet, which detailed the following:      (OTP stands for ""one-time password,"" a security method commonly used as part of 2FA, or ""two-factor identification."") The account @6 is for Adrian Lamo, a journalist with 163,000 followers, who has now put his account on private.      Jessy Irwin, a security professional formerly of AgileBits (maker of 1Password) and Cosmos maker Tendermint, said there are a lot of ways to hack into big accounts.      ""There are endless OAuth integrations, the APIs that allow third-party services to access the platform, and some of the SMS features,"" she wrote. ""[Twitter has] done some work to improve authorization and authentication, but if you are a super-user or you have a team posting for you, it's still extremely difficult to secure the service.""      Parham Eftekhari, of the Cybersecurity Collaborative, a forum for security pros, cautioned that all security professionals could do is speculate. The scale of the attack and Twitter's frustrated response indicated the problem could be a deep one:    Inside the birdhouse    Many security-adjacent accounts are sharing rumors that the breach is actually from inside Twitter, which would suggest all kinds of data could be compromised.      Richard Ma, founder of smart-contract auditing firm Quantstamp, told CoinDesk his team believed the problem was at Twitter's San Francisco HQ.      ""Based on what we've gathered so far, this is an internal Twitter security breach. The hacker was able to breach Twitter and gain access to internal admin functionality,"" he told CoinDesk.      Irwin added:    ""It is a 'silly' hack, but it's also important to look at why people are motivated to hack things. Some hackers like to watch the world burn – that's just how it is. It could be a campaign to make Twitter look silly or ill-prepared for the role it has in public discourse.""    Eftekhari agreed, noting it's important to remember we are in a U.S. presidential election year, and that Twitter is a de facto communications institution for the United States, which could be an appealing target to rival nation-states.      After all, he noted, the payout ($106,200 so far) was small.      Read more: Obama, Biden, Netanyahu, Musk: Here’s a List of Every Hacked Twitter Account      Irwin said associates in the security community have already noticed the domains being used by the cybercriminals have been active since April. ""That suggests this is a known issue or an older vulnerability that was not recently introduced,"" she said.      Yonathan Klijnsma, a threat researcher at the cybersecurity company RiskIQ, said that while he can't be sure, there is speculation a Twitter support member account was hijacked.      ""While we do not know if this is the cause, it might explain how they hijacked so many accounts,"" Klijnsma told CoinDesk in an email. ""Twitter support is able to help users who are locked out of their account by (normally) verifying information and then helping them get back into their account. Gaining access to a support member’s account could lead to the massive and seemingly effortless hijacking we observed today.""      He said the scale of the ongoing scam through these Twitter accounts with massive followings seems to be the whole story.      ""But RiskIQ has been able to track much more of the bad guys' infrastructure used in their scam operations,"" said Klijnsma. ""We've identified around 400 domains so far that are all tied to these scams.""    Scam's source    Rosén emphasized to CoinDesk that he could only speculate, but noted the origin of the tweets has been ""Twitter Web App"" and that Twitter Support noted people might expect trouble with resets.      This suggested to Rosén that the ""service used to send out password resets was breached somehow,"" and that ""some specific flow when resetting password made it possible to gain access to the web app.""      Which, he cautioned, might mean the attacker could do more than tweet, such as accessing direct messages (DMs). Dan Guido, of Trail of Bits, a security firm widely relied on in crypto, pointed CoinDesk to a thread he wrote on the incident on one of his firm's secondary accounts. In that, he noted:    ""Twitter has never been great at securing their own data. After getting their backend hacked in 2009 (very similar to today!), the FTC barred Twitter from making claims about their security for 20 years.""    Quantstamp's Ma said this event could cement a key belief of the crypto faithful.      ""Overall, I think this reinforces many people's preference for self-custody of data in the crypto community,"" Ma said. ""Many Twitter users are not aware of the full control they are providing when using a third-party platform with special privileges over their accounts.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | REGULATION,"Brady Dale, Benjamin Powers",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/15/twitter-breach-reactions-security-professionals-offer-an-early-assessment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/369308658fda187dd696be277eb20db8856de03c-2048x1292.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Click here for CoinDesk’s full coverage of the Twitter hack.    The messages pumped a bitcoin giveaway scam associated with an organization called “Crypto For Health.”      First, they came for Binance’s account. Gemini was next. Then Coinbase. CoinDesk. Justin Sun. Charlie Lee. Bitcoin.org. Kucoin. Bitfinex. The Tron Foundation. Ripple.      Millions of collective followers began seeing the same, cloying message: “I am giving back to my fans. All Bitcoin sent to my address below will be sent back doubled.”      About one hour in, the hack ditched its “Crypto For Health” tagline and went mainstream. Elon Musk’s account led the charge. Then Bill Gates. Then Elon Musk’s account came back for more. Kanye showed up an hour later. Jeff Bezos promised $50 million. Michael Bloomberg. Joe Biden. Barack Obama.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $9,185 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,153-$9,279  BTC below 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Traders seem to pine for the bitcoin volatility that was once the norm – and they expect it to return after what has been a lull. “Trading bitcoins is about as exciting as sitting in traffic,” said Jack Tan, founding partner of Taiwan-based quantitative firm Kronos Research. “I’m guessing bitcoin’s time will come in the next couple of months, but for now just enjoy the altcoin and equities rallies.”      Read More: CoinDesk Quarterly Review, Q2 2020      Indeed, alternative coins to bitcoin, or altcoins, are picking up traction. Bitcoin’s dominance, a measure of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency occupies crypto market share, is down to 63%. It’s a level not seen since Feb. 18, as traders look towards non-bitcoin assets, particularly in the decentralized finance, or DeFI, space.      In addition, stock markets are up today:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 in Japan closed up 1.5%, at a one-month high led by gains in automaker Nissan and marketing firm Dentsu.  Europe’s FTSE 100 in London ended the day up 1.8% on positive news of a coronavirus vaccine trial.  The U.S. S&P 500 index gained 0.9% as travel stocks and Goldman Sachs ended trading in the green.    Meanwhile, bitcoin continues to trade in stasis around $9,200. “Over the last three months we’ve seen lower volatility, and especially over the last 30 days it’s at a historic low for bitcoin,” said Michael Rabkin of Chicago-based crypto trading firm DV Chain. According to data from Skew, bitcoin’s implied volatility, a measure of the future expectation of volatility, has dipped as low as 46% in July.      “This tells you what the market thinks the volatility of bitcoin is based on options pricing – dead in the water,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alphas5.      Read More: Correlation - Crypto’s Most Enigmatic Metric      It’s a holding pattern for bitcoin, said Rabkin. “I think given the equity markets being up – in my opinion based on the additional announced quantitative easing – we could see the price rise as investors look for a safe haven asset as coronavirus and trade wars continue,” he told CoinDesk.    Uniswap offers more trading pairs    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Wednesday, trading around $237 and slipping 1.5% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The Ethereum-powered decentralized exchange, or DEX, Uniswap is the top-ranking platform by volume at $30 million per day. One of the reasons: trading choice. Andrew Tu of algorithm trading firm Efficient Frontier says with Uniswap’s smart contract upgrade to version 2 in May, the DEX can perform swaps not just from ether-to-token, but also token-to-token on Ethereum’s network. “This creates much more flexibility in the types of pairs offered,” he said.      Uniswap currently offers 351 coins and 794 trading pairs, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. By comparison, second-largest DEX Balancer has 69 coins with 136 pairs. Third place in volume is stablecoin DEX Curve, which offers eight coins and 19 trading pairs. “Liquidity begets more liquidity,” said Tu. “The more liquidity a venue has, the more it attracts new traders, who add to the pool and create more liquidity.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed, mostly in the red Wednesday.

Some Bahamian banks and ATMs remained offline for months, the central bank said in its Sunday report. “Mobile phone coverage, by contrast, was generally restored within a few days after Dorian,” it said.  The central bank believes it can fast-track future recoveries by building CBDC functionality into mobile phones. It projected this could help ease critical post-disaster recovery tools such as receiving insurance claims.  “The Dorian aftermath demonstrated one major benefit: rapid payments system restoration after a disaster,” the central bank said.

42432260,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBjdh,1594831787,How a Digital Dollar Can Make the Financial System More Equitable,"Patrick Murck is chief legal officer at Transparent Systems, developers of distributed settlement solutions, and an affiliate at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center. Linda Jeng is global head of policy and special counsel at Transparent Systems and a senior fellow at Georgetown’s Institute of International Economic Law.      Digital dollars can be designed in any number of ways, and these design choices will have profound implications for the people who use them. Congress should carefully consider why we need a digital dollar and what should be the core objectives. Is the goal of a digital dollar simply to make payments more efficient, or do we want a digital dollar that helps build a more equitable and inclusive financial system?      Under the strain of civil unrest and the COVID-19 lockdown, cracks that have long existed in the American economic system are widening into fissures, from health care and child care to food production and financial services. The accumulation of these fissures is exacerbating an already significant wealth and opportunity gap between richer and poorer American households, one that all too often falls along racial lines. According to Pew Research Center, the U.S. middle class has been shrinking over the past five decades and is no longer a large majority.      See also: Digital Dollar? Get Real, Financial Inclusion Advocates Tell Congress      The wealth gap between upper-income and middle- and lower-income families is growing apace. Since 1983, the share of U.S. aggregate wealth of upper income families grew from 60% to 79%, while shares of wealth for middle income families fell from 32% to 17%, and from 7% to 4% for lower income families. Nearly half of all Americans live paycheck to paycheck.      In a recent Federal Reserve survey, one in five American workers lost their jobs in March, among which 40% were from low-income households making less than $40,000. The gap in access to financial services has made it difficult for even the government to quickly send rescue money to those in need under the CARES Act.      A few members in Congress had the courage to be innovative and introduced bills proposing a Fed-run digital dollar, but the focus of their bills was limited to a “digital dollar” that was merely a conduit for American households and businesses to open accounts directly with the Federal Reserve. Elsewhere in the private sector, Facebook revised its Libra offering in an attempt to placate the many and varied critiques of its first crypto-currency proposal. Libra’s response was simply falling back on conventional and not particularly innovative approaches.      These discussions are neglecting how technology design often reinforces the status quo and the gaps between the haves and the have-nots of America. Digital dollar efforts need to be intentional about how their designs leverage actual innovation in a way that helps bridge these gaps if our goal is to foster a more equitable and inclusive national economy.    Community-based ownership would allow the economic gains of the network to be equitably shared and not reserved for those who have access to capital and connections.    Not unlike the social contract between banks and the public, there is also a social contract between financial platforms and the public. To reflect this truth, these digital dollar networks should be treated as public utilities. The public that uses digital dollar networks should share in the ownership and governance of these networks. Meaningful self-governance of the financial networks and platforms we use would help facilitate actual inclusion of communities in their economic growth and well-being rather than the predatory inclusion that is all-too-common in tech and financial circles.      In particular, for underserved communities to find a digital dollar useful and supportive of the kinds of services and products they need, the digital dollar network needs to be first designed around these communities' lived experiences and not based on assumptions or aggregate data. Community-based ownership would further ensure a meaningful role in the design of these networks. As owners, they can lay the foundational digital stack for a generative economic ecosystem that serves their real economic needs.      Beyond governance, community-based ownership would allow the economic gains of the network to be equitably shared among all participants and not reserved for those who have access to capital and connections. That is, unlike Libra where the network is owned by Facebook and other big tech and financial firms, consideration should be given for public or co-operative ownership of digital dollar networks by the actual users. By placing the users at the top of the ownership structure, revenues and capital can be deployed to best serve the interests of these communities rather than a distant, often rent-seeking, third party.

Prates – Digital Dollars Can Reduce Unemployment, Here’s How      Technological advancement has lowered the costs of creating and administering networks such that a cooperative model for a digital dollar network has become feasible and could unlock significantly more accessible and efficient financial services that are tailored to community needs. Slow paper checks and invoices and costly wire transfers can and should be made irrelevant. People getting faster and more direct access to money would be able to automate their cash flow, saving on time and costly fees.

Here's the story:      Trial Plan China wants to trial its digital yuan with online food seller Meituan-Dianping as well as another two Tencent-backed companies. The Beijing-based company has held talks with the research wing at the People's Bank of China (PBoC) over trialling the digital yuan on its platform, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg. The exact details of the collaboration are not yet known. Listed in Hong Kong, Meituan-Dianping's 400 million active users make it one of the largest food delivery platforms in the world.      Funding Dissent Opposition politicians and dissidents in Russia are using bitcoin to fund their activities against President Vladimir Putin. “Our opponents understand they can’t cut us off from sources of funding because [if they try] at least a part of the donations will go into crypto,” Leonid Volkov, who manages political operations for Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most prominent opponent, said. “Last time our accounts got frozen, we saw an uptick in bitcoin donations.” The candidate has raised more than 600 bitcoin since 2016, and other non-governmental organizations and advocacy groups have followed suit.      BitLicense Feedback? Industry reactions made to the BitLicense have been overwhelmingly positive, said Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services. Lacewell, who took office last year, has created a conditional license allowing companies to partner with existing licensed entities to legally operate in New York, enabled self-certification of virtual currencies and has issued guidance on coin listings for licensed platforms.      Privacy Threatened Multiple bills that threaten encryption are moving through the U.S. Senate and could pose a threat to technology that protects users’ privacy. The Lawful Access to Encrypted Data (LAED) Act and the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (“EARN IT”) Act take aim at privacy tech and cryptography by mandating “backdoors” be installed for government watchdogs. “There’s no such thing as a backdoor just for good guys,” said Daisy Soderberg-Rivkin, a fellow focusing on children and technology at the R Street Institute, a policy think tank in Washington, D.C. “This opens up users’ information to a whole mess of bad actors.”      New Fund An Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) alum is launching a venture firm focused on building a crypto-powered “ownership economy.” Jesse Walden, who focused on blockchain investments at a16z, announced his Variant Fund in a blog post published Tuesday, which is backed by a16z’s Chris Dixon and Marc Andreessen, Union Square Ventures and Compound’s Robert Leshner. Separately, Evertas, an insurance provider focused on the cryptocurrency space, has raised $2.8 million in a seed round led by Morgan Creek.    Quick bites  Revolut, a fintech startup, is bringing bitcoin and ether access to customers in 49 U.S. states.  Texas Man’s alleged use of PPP funds for crypto instead of BBQ has feds asking: Where’s the Beef?  Grayscale reports it raised a total of $906M for its crypto products in Q2 2020, its best quarter to date.  Jack Dorsey’s Cash App sponsored NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace to sport the Bitcoin logo while racing.  Japan is seriously considering a “digital yen.”  The narrative    A leaked FBI bulletin makes reference to OneCoin, in all but name, when detailing the money-laundering risks of private investment funds.      In the bulletin, dated May 1, the FBI argues criminals and foreign adversaries of the U.S. “likely” use hedge funds, private equity and other investment vehicles to circumvent financial institutions’ anti-money laundering (AML) procedures.      OneCoin’s story is told, without naming the firm or its founders, as an example of a “fraudulent cryptocurrency investment scheme.” A known Ponzi scheme, the FBI details how the fraudsters maneuvered through the banking system, without ever disclosing the source of its funds, and was able to transfer stolen funds to “a series of purported private equity funds holding accounts at financial institutions, including those in the Cayman Islands and the Republic of Ireland,” according to the report.      Incidentally, two OneCoin promoters were found dead in Mexico last month.      “While OneCoin was a scam, the veiled references to its crimes in the FBI bulletin are a salient reminder that banks, not cryptocurrencies, were used to launder the ill-gotten gains,” CoinDesk reports.    Market intel    Alt-Season Bitcoin is still consolidating with no clear direction in sight, but some alternative cryptocurrencies are soaring. The leading cryptocurrency has been trading the narrow range of $9,000–$10,000 for two months. Meanwhile, link, a token used on the decentralized oracle network Chainlink, is up 78% on a month-to-date basis and up 364% for 2020. And Aave’s lend token has increased by over 1200% so far this year, following the launch of mainnet in January.    Tech pod    Bitcoin Smart Contracts Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin has revealed his work on a new smart-contract language for Bitcoin, which he hopes will increase the “financial self-sovereignty” of users. The new language, called Sapio, could enable the building of stateful smart contracts, a type most commonly associated with the Ethereum blockchain. Bitcoin supports several different types of smart contracts, which are generally much more complicated to create than on Ethereum.      Ethereum's Client Ethereum 2.0 client Prysm is “basically ready” to launch, according to Richard Ma, CEO of Quantstamp, the code's auditor. This news comes on the heels of last week’s announced push by network developers to launch the proof-of-stake (PoS) version of Ethereum before 2020 closes out. Prysm client’s code was “well-written and documented,” Quantstamp said in a blog post. The firm identified 65 issues relating to the granularity of timestamps, pseudo-random number generation and second preimage attacks on Merkle trees. Ten engineers combed over Prysm’s ETH 2.0 codebase, programmed in the Go language, for two months, Ma said.    Opinion    American Mindshare J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist and owner of the popular Moneyness blog, looks into the Federal Reserve’s annual “Survey of Consumer Choice” and determines bitcoin has American mindshare, but few users. According to the survey, in 2019, 70.7% of participants said they were familiar with bitcoin, up from 68.7% in 2018. Though out of 3,363 surveyed, effectively 0% had used bitcoin to make payments in the previous 12 months. “Bitcoin has succeeded in grabbing an impressively large chunk of American mindshare. However, common knowledge of bitcoin tends to be of poor quality,” Koning writes.    Who won #CryptoTwitter?

42432266,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBjnh,1594828852,IRS Sued by Ex-Coinbase User Over Seizure of Financial Records,"A former Coinbase user who last August received the now-infamous Internal Revenue Service (IRS) crypto letter is suing to block the tax agency from unlawfully seizing private financial records.    Bitcoin researcher Jim Harper accused the IRS, its commissioner and up to 10 unnamed agents of violating his privacy and due process rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution in a 26-page civil action filed in New Hampshire District Court on Wednesday.  Last summer, Harper and more than 10,000 other taxpayers learned in a “soft letter” that the IRS had “information” on their cryptocurrency accounts. IRS agents wrote they had reason to believe he had not paid taxes on the crypto. (Harper claims he’s paid his crypto taxes in full since 2013.)  The IRS never said where it got its “information,” but Harper believes his details may have been among the trove of 13,000 account records that IRS agents seized from Coinbase in early 2018 following a court order and controversial legal fight.  “If they acquired it via the Coinbase summons – and we don't know that for sure – it was a defective process that denied me the opportunity to contest the seizure of my data,” Harper told CoinDesk in an email. “I'll be seeking destruction of the records in the IRS's control. A win would allow all recipients of the letter to seek the same.”  Caleb Kruckenberg, a New Civil Liberties Alliance lawyer who is representing Harper pro bono, told CoinDesk Harper’s case is an opportunity to put some checks on the power of the administrative state.

42432276,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBjxh,1594827054,Yield Farming Expands From Finance to Digital Collectibles,"Fresh soil can now be tilled for yield on Ethereum: the world of digital collectibles.      Yield farming has turned decentralized finance (DeFi) into the juggernaut of crypto earnings here in mid-2020, but one non-DeFi startup believes its users will also be interested in earning a new governance token for making trades.      Starting Wednesday, Rarible, a dapp that enables users to create and market non-fungible tokens (NFTs), will begin keeping track of all transactions on the site in order to reward users each week with its new governance token: RARI.      In fact, the largest share of RARI will go to Rarible users who make trades, some 60% of the total supply. Trading amounts to mining for this new token.      That's not all, however.      Rarible has also set aside tokens for two key groups. First, anyone who holds NFTs now will be able to claim some. Second, existing users of Rarible who helped the project grow will also receive an allotment.    The art of governance    In a world founded in aesthetics, it is better to disperse authority, Rarible co-founder Alex Salnikov told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""It is always controversial in the art world, what decisions to make here,"" he said.      NFTs are digital tokens that are designed to be completely unique and can only be held in one wallet at a time. That way, you can create some kind of creative work and someone can really say that they own it. CryptoKitties made the standard famous, though another project called CryptoPunks is usually credited as the true pioneer. Right now, the bestselling NFT is digital real estate, that is, deeds to land in online spaces like Decentraland and Cryptovoxels, but also sports cards are seeing growth.      Read more: As Museums Go Dark, Crypto Art Finds Its Frame      Moscow-based Rarible has to make a lot of decisions going forward as a company. By creating a governance token, Salnikov said the site can involve its community in a substantive way. For example, the platform is free for everyone to use, so they need to decide whether or not to introduce fees for using it.      It's also looking to innovate in how people invest in NFTs, which could create another key role for RARI holders.      ""We are planning to investigate the creation of NFT index, so if you want to bet on the NFT market in general that it will grow,"" Salnikov said. So there would be an overall NFT index but probably also indexes for smaller segments of the market, such as digital real estate and art.      ""Since an index needs to be a representative of the market and the community is a representation of the market, we do believe we need a community to build an index,"" Salnikov explained.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Rewarding users with a fresh new token that has governance powers has worked in DeFi, but with the growth hack expanding to another sector it could mark a turning point for crypto in general. It remains to be seen whether that turning point proves to be the bend in the hockey stick or the peak before the downward slope.    Token distribution    Before people can start voting their RARI tokens they need to hold them, so here are the distribution details.      There will be 25 million RARI tokens created, using the ERC-20 token standard. Of those, 30% will be reserved for the team and the company's ecosystem, 2% will go to Rarible's existing users and 4% will be distributed to holders of any NFT sold on any platform.      For that last group to claim their RARI, though, they will need to register with Rarible. The distribution will be based on how much users spend on their NFT holdings. Later there will be another distribution of 4% of the RARI supply, again to all NFT users.      So these will both be airdrops, but users will have to take the covers off their cisterns to catch it.      The rest of the tokens, 60% of the supply, will be distributed over four years to everyone who buys and sells NFTs on the site. For 200 weeks, starting this Sunday, it will distribute 1/200th of the supply designated for users to everyone based on how much they spent and earned on Rarible that week, divided proportionally.      Salnikov said the startup hopes the high gas prices on Ethereum right now will be enough to dissuade wash trading, but if it's not that might persuade token holders to vote for instituting some kind of fee.      Rarible will start keeping track of transactions for purposes of the distribution now, timed to the publication of this story.    What Rarible does    Rarible is a marketplace for NFTs, similar to sites like OpenSea.      It's also a platform for creating NFTs (in crypto parlance, ""minting""). So users can go to Rarible with some kind of content they own and link that digital content to an NFT, a cryptographic proof-of-ownership.      ""We support single editions, multiple editions and one of the coolest features is unlockable features,"" Salnikov explained.      For example: Artists could sell a film or a book as an NFT. They could provide some sort of preview of the content (such as a sample or a trailer) but all the content wouldn't ""unlock"" until the NFT actually sold (that is, you couldn't read the full book or watch the movie unless you had the NFT).      Raribles system supports both ERC-721, the fully non-fungible token, and ERC-1155, which allows for semi-fungibility, a popular idea with game makers. Salnikov says it has a lot of ideas on its development list and a small development team, so the governance token could be used to help decide what upgrades to prioritize.    A moderated market    Additionally, shifting to digital art raises new questions for governance, such as how to curate the main pages of the Rarible marketplace, so that the most appealing projects are seen up front.      Further art introduces complex issues of categorization, such as what's a remix, what's an original work, what's actually piracy, etc. In other words, if this sector grows, moderation is going to become an increasingly burdensome.      Like any creatively oriented site, moderation eventually becomes an issue. ""It's always easy to start to do that, but when we are talking about the efficiency of that process it won't be so easy,"" Salnikov admitted.      He hopes that with a large group of people whose interests are aligned with the marketplace's success, they might be able to crowdsource those decisions more successfully than Web 2.0 has.      But if Rarible can get governance of its marketplace for virtual baubles right, it has the potential to turn yield farming's new pastures from a wild tangle of weeds into a seductively landscaped garden.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | MANA | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/15/yield-farming-expands-from-finance-to-digital-collectibles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/220351ef061d996e756e23dde8be026b05d3af81-1900x1900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a Wednesday company blog post, BitMEX/HDR founder and CEO Arthur Hayes announced the parent entity now has a new name: ""100x.""  Hayes said the change would open the firm up to ""new opportunities and investments"" amid the rise in digital financial systems around the world.  Seychelles-based 100x will now be the holding entity for BitMEX and the group's other assets.  The BitMEX platform and brand will remain unchanged.  While the holding firm's new name could appear to be a reference to leverage – using borrowed funds for derivatives trading – Hayes claims differently.  Any financial service industry that functions on the practices of ""opacity, obfuscation and deference to anointed experts"" is ""fair game for destruction by 100x,"" he said.  BitMEX and similar crypto trading platforms have been criticized for offering high levels of leverage that some say bring too much risk for inexperienced traders.

42432280,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBk3h,1594824326,New Metric Suggests Imminent Volatility for Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s characteristically high volatility could return soon, giving exhausted traders an end to months of abnormally calm price action. A new metric for on-chain activity makes this prediction by measuring exchange volumes and on-chain transaction volume together to derive a signal for inflection points in bitcoin volatility.      Published to popular charting interface TradingView on Tuesday, the indicator calculates a ratio of relative dominance between bitcoin trading volume on exchanges to transaction volume happening directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The exchange data is taken from eight leading exchanges and 23 trading pairs.      On-chain transaction volume includes bitcoins moved between wallets and possibly to or from exchanges. Exchange volume is the amount of bitcoins bought and sold over a given time period.      The volume ratio aims to derive market sentiment as a function of both types of volume. When overlaid with price data, high on-chain transaction volume dominance over exchange volume frequently corresponds with imminent, significant price movements, or volatility.      Unlike traditional markets, transaction volumes and other on-chain data allow cryptocurrency traders to watch investors move their assets in real time. These indicators can often signal significant shifts in the market and show important investor activity that could serve as a catalyst for “massive moves,” especially during periods of low volatility, according to Josh Olszewicz, cryptocurrency trader at Techemy Capital.      “We are primed for the same type of move now,” Olszewicz told CoinDesk.      Why does on-chain volume dominance frequently precede large price movements? One reason could be “whales” and other large investors buying or selling large quantities of bitcoin through over-the-counter desks and prime brokers or simply moving coins to exchange wallets in preparation to buy or sell.      These movements are reflected in on-chain transactions but not exchange volume as represented in this ratio, explains Jean Baptiste Pavageau, partner at Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. The size of these transactions can often move the market, however, and when a new trend emerges retail investors “often tend to push and extend the move by buying on exchange directly,” said Pavageau, which is reflected in increasing exchange volume that reduces on-chain volume dominance.      As a predictive tool, however, the volume ratio measure is imperfect, and some traders are skeptical that this volume ratio – or any market analysis – is useful for timing changes in volatility and price trends.

They don’t give you a time catalyst,” said Zoran Scekic, managing partner at Zorax Capital. “If they did then everyone would be rich knowing when to buy or sell volatility.”      Bitcoin’s volatility has steadily dropped more than 68% during the past two months, according to Coin Metrics, as the price continues to trade in a tight range between $9,000 and $10,000.      “This ratio only tries to highlight the fact that a move should happen, but we have no timing indication,” said Pavageau.      “Everyone has been saying volatility is imminent for the last several weeks,” added Scekic. “The truth is, no one knows.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/15/new-metric-suggests-imminent-volatility-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42f9d7714e8d08c1218106f2e1eed42f880c900e-1280x847.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432271,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBjph,1594823707,Hong Kong Citizens Turn to Stablecoins to Resist National Security Law,"In Hong Kong, some local citizens are turning to crypto assets and encrypted communication to resist financial surveillance and internet censorship.       Hong Kong’s national security law, enacted on June 30, aims to quell opposition to China’s ruling Communist Party. The law has raised widespread fears of a clampdown on free speech and tighter control over the city’s financial system. Under the new law, the Hong Kong government will be able to freeze and confiscate assets from people or organizations that are suspected of being involved in national security crimes.      Data suggests people in Hong Kong are increasingly using stablecoins, which are digital tokens whose value is pegged to fiat currencies, as a way of keeping their assets independent of a banking system that is subject to government control.      As the chart above demonstrates, trading volume between Hong Kong dollars and the U.S.-dollar pegged stablecoin USDT saw a surge in early June on the fiat-crypto trading platform TideBit. The surge followed the decision to strengthen Hong Kong’s national security law, which was unveiled by Chinese legislators during the Two Sessions, the largest annual political gathering in mainland China. The second trading surge on the exchange followed the enactment of the new law on June 30.      The data analysis by CoinDesk was based on a relatively small sample due to limited access to stablecoin trading volumes and the fact that many stablecoin purchases have been via over-the counter (OTC) trades in Hong Kong and mainland China. The trend could also be influenced by a handful of ""whales,"" or the investors holding a large number of assets, trading during these periods of time.      But the surge in the stablecoin trade could also signal Hong Kong citizens’ desire to protect their assets.      “Many people don’t believe they can trust the government or banks to keep their assets safe anymore,” said Brian Yim, a university student in the UK whose family is still in Hong Kong. Yim says people he knows are trying to buy crypto assets in Hong Kong. “If the Hong Kong police and government consider you as a national security suspect, they can seize your assets and even just take them,” he said      Read More: Hong Kong’s National Security Law Could Threaten Local Crypto Brokerages      Cryptocurrencies could serve another purpose as well: fundraising for protestors. HSBC froze the bank accounts protesters were using to pay bail for arrested protesters last November.    Stablecoins in Asia    Even before the national security law, stablecoins played a special role in Asia. Stablecoins such as USDT are a popular way to avoid capital controls and make cross-border money transactions less traceable. Mainland China citizens might use stablecoins in Hong Kong to make money transfers that exceed the yearly capital control of $50,000 that is imposed by the People’s Bank of China.      “The adoption of crypto in China, Hong Kong, Asia is very underground,” said Darius Sit, founder and chief investment officer of Singapore-based crypto firm QCP Capital, in a panel discussion at CoinDesk’s Asia Invest conference last September. “If you go to Hong Kong, the money exchanges to trade tether are physically on the spot.” said Sit, whose company runs an over the counter (OTC) trading desk.      Sit said capital controls are one of the key characteristics differentiating Asian over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks from those in the West. OTC trading desks are a type of marketplace where the middleman matches traders with their counterparties with an agreed price as opposed to a centralized exchange where people trade cryptocurrencies based on the spot market price.      “While a western OTC desk may see 80% in BTC, ethereum and 20% in stablecoins trading, you flip it in Asia desks,” Sit said. “We trade a lot more tether, USDC, TUSD.”    More secure communications    In addition to concerns over the security of financial assets, the national security law also sparks fears of internet censorship and more extensive surveillance over personal data.      Major U.S. tech companies including Facebook, Google and Zoom said they would temporarily stop cooperating and sharing user data with Hong Kong authorities. Local government said companies violating the new law would face penalties, including the jailing of company’s employees.      Chinese video app TikTok has decided to withdraw from stores in Hong Kong and make its services inaccessible to its local users.      Concern over increased Chinese control has been growing in Hong Kong for some time now. “Even before the law was enacted, people were deleting Facebook accounts and posts,” said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. “People were moving off of WhatsAPP to Signal and they have become a lot more conscious about what they say on social media and securing their communication.”      “For someone who has worked both in China and Hong Kong, it is quite striking because people in Hong Kong didn’t have that level of fear in the past,” Wang said.      According to Wang, the most straightforward way to protect oneself is to choose a different communication tool, going from WhatsAPP or Telegram to Signal and not posting on Facebook.      “People stop using centralized messaging apps, such as Facebook’s WhatsAPP, because they fear that these companies may comply with Hong Kong authority’s requests for their private information and they believe that in the near future, the Hong Kong government might just ban these apps for not complying with them all together,” Yim said.      “Most protesters on the street are young people and they don’t really have this concern about things like their assets because they don’t have any and they are more focused on the privacy part,” Yim said.      Signal, the end-to-end encrypted messaging app, has become the most downloaded app in Hong Kong.      Read More: Global Protests Reveal Bitcoin’s Limitations      “Traditionally, when the Hong Kong government and companies collect your data, the expectation is that the data stays with that agency for the purpose in which the information is collected and it doesn’t travel and get integrated into other platforms,” Wang said. However, the police in mainland China share people’s data across platforms.      “The national security law does not let the police have that power either, but over time it would lead to the erosion of the data protection regime in Hong Kong. I think there is a certain danger of that,” Wang said.      More tech-savvy people would use virtual private networks (VPN), through which users can cross the ""great firewall"" and protect their identities on the Internet, Wang said.      VPN downloads in the Apple Store surged on the heels of Beijing’s announcement to enact the national security law. Seven out of 10 of the most downloaded apps, excluding games, are VPN apps. Still, China’s great firewall can recognize traffic from VPN services, so anonymizing user information is another step individuals can take. Here, too, crypto can play a role in helping Hong Kong residents keep their communications private.      Steven Waterhouse, CEO of VPN provider Orchid, said disguising the traffic as video data can obfuscate what users are doing online, and using crypto tokens to pay for services rather than bank-linked fiat accounts can help users protect themselves.      “Crypto could also help people in Hong Kong keep their communications private. The firewall can still recognize VPN traffic and prevent users from accessing blocked content,” he said. “The blockchain can in many ways be used to register the nodes as part of the network and enable payments between the users and the nodes that are providing the VPN services.""",POSITIVE,USDT,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/15/hong-kong-citizens-turn-to-stablecoins-to-resist-national-security-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c124c6229d344e5455d7bf0fb9651da4746aca3a-1442x866.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday, IBM has teamed with J. M. Smucker Company – the $12.2 billion food giant behind coffee brands like Folgers, Café Bustelo and Dunkin’ – to trace the supply chain of Colombian coffee.      The program is meant to support the farmers who grow Smucker’s coffee beans with clickable donations to a variety of local community programs to build schools, clean water systems and other infrastructure.      The coffee provenance blockchain, which IBM says is ready to go into production, is built on the Hyperledger Fabric-based IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply platform and has been coordinated with help from Farmer Connect, a tech provider that specializes in sustainable supply chain apps.      “We are applying digital tech to trace the coffee and ensure the farmers are being paid properly,” said IBM Global Blockchain Industry Leader Paul Chang. “But this initiative takes it a step further, allowing the consumers to engage the farmers directly and potentially impact their livelihoods.

42432286,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBkBh,1594820270,Bitcoin Has American Mindshare but Few Users,"J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and is a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.      Bitcoin usage in the U.S: Everyone knows about it, but still few takers      The Federal Reserve's annual ""Survey of Consumer Choice"" is out. It looks like 2019 was an unspectacular year for cryptocurrency adoption.      See also: J.P. Koning – How Bitcoin Is Like Ham Radio      Consumer surveys are one of the best ways to get information about what people actually use to make payments. The best surveys are run by private companies such as Visa, PayPal and Wells Fargo, which means the data is proprietary – we don't get to see the results. Lucky for us, the Federal Reserve, the U.S.'s central bank, carries out an excellent annual survey called the ""Survey of Consumer Payment Choice"" (SCPC). It makes all of the data public.      The bulk of the information the SCPC collects concerns conventional payment instruments like cash and cards. For instance, cash usage continued to fall in 2019, accounting for 21.5% of all U.S. consumer payments in a typical month, down from 23.5% in 2018 (and 30% in 2009!). Meanwhile debit, credit and prepaid cards combined for 61.4% of all payments in 2019, up from 60% in 2018. Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, this is likely to be higher in 2020.      If you're interested in payments, I'd suggest giving the summary results of the 2019 SCPC a closer read. For the rest of this article I'm going to focus on one small corner of the SCPC, cryptocurrencies.      The SCPC has been quietly gathering information about cryptocurrency usage since 2014. Each year it adds or subtracts new questions in an effort to better understand how Americans are using bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and more.    Bitcoin has succeeded in grabbing an impressively large chunk of American mindshare. However, common knowledge of bitcoin tends to be of poor quality.    One of the longest-running cryptocurrency questions in the SCPC is ""have you heard of bitcoin?"" In 2019, an impressive 70.7% of survey participants responded that they were familiar with bitcoin, up from 68.7% in 2018. When the survey first began to collect bitcoin information in 2014, just 45.1% had heard of it. The biggest jump occurred between the 2017 and 2018 SCPC, no doubt due to the epic December 2017 bitcoin price spike.      No other cryptocurrency has the name recognition of bitcoin. In 2019 just 8.3% of survey participants had heard of ethereum, 7.5% of litecoin and 2.6% of XRP.      See also: Is Bitcoin in 2020 Really Like the Early Internet?      Only bitcoin cash (BCH) comes close to bitcoin’s brand recognition. An outsized 40.3% of survey participants report having heard of BCH. Given that actual on-chain usage of BCH is quite low, it's probably safe to assume many survey participants are mistakenly assuming bitcoin and BCH were the same thing.      If bitcoin is recognized by most Americans, how well is it understood? The SCPC teases this out by asking those who have heard about bitcoin to rank their familiarity with it on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being ""not at all"" and 5 being ""extremely.""      In 2019, 87.4% of respondents choose ""not at all"" or ""slightly."" Only 4.5% or respondents said they were ""moderately"" or ""extremely"" familiar with bitcoin. This degree of familiarity has stayed constant since 2014, suggesting the quality of public understanding of bitcoin is low and is not improving.      So what about adoption? Bitcoin is a bit like base jumping. Most people know of base jumping, but most people don't have the guts to do it. Likewise, even though a huge proportion of Americans now know about bitcoin, most don't own any. Of the 3,363 survey participants queried about bitcoin in the 2019 SCPC, just 35 respondents – or 1.0% – reported owning bitcoin. This is down from 1.2% in 2018.      Even though 2019 wasn't a great year for adoption, bitcoin ownership rates have generally been increasing over the last few years. When the survey began to record cryptocurrency data in 2014, just 0.4% of survey participants owned bitcoin. It has since more than doubled.      Bitcoin ownership dominates other cryptocurrencies. Whereas a total of 35 respondents reported holding bitcoin in 2019, just 20 people owned ethereum, 16 people held litecoin, 10 owned bitcoin cash, and 10 held XRP.      So what do American bitcoiners use their bitcoins for? Not payments. In 2019, just two out of 3,363 Americans surveyed in the SCPC (effectively 0%) had used bitcoin to make payments in the previous 12 months. This is down from eight people using it for payments in 2018, but about the same amount registered in previous surveys between 2014 to 2017. So, even though bitcoin's name recognition is rising and more people are holding it than in 2014, its usage as money continues to stagnate.      See also: J.P. Koning – Lessons From the First Digital Gold Boom      This is especially salient when compared to competing payments systems. In 2019, 8.5% of survey participants (a total of 283 people) had used Zelle to make a purchase or pay another person in the last 12 months. Zelle is a bank-owned instant person-to-person payments network that was introduced in 2016. Venmo, another popular person-to-person payments network, was used by 11.3% of participants. Both Venmo and Bitcoin first appeared in 2009.      So if not for payments, why do people hold the stuff? The SCPC attempts to ferret out the answer by querying people about their motivations for holding cryptocurrencies. The most popular reason is ""investment,"" with 56% of respondents listing this as their primary reason in 2019. The second most popular is ""interested in new technology"" at 23%, suggesting a hobbyist mentality. These proportions were about the same as 2018.      Almost no survey participant holds cryptocurrencies in order to ""buy goods and services in the U.S."" or to make ""anonymous payments"". Nor do they choose ""do not trust banks"" or ""do not trust the government"" as reasons for holding bitcoins or ether.      Finally, the typical American does not hold a large amount of bitcoin. In 2019, the median holding was $200 worth of bitcoin, up from $70 in 2018. This lift is probably due to the timing of the SCPC, which is run in September. In September 2018 the bitcoin price was around $8000 whereas in September 2019 it reached as high as $14,000.      See also: Bitcoin Needs ‘Real Use Cases’ to Become Digital Gold, Says ICE Chief      All of this data allows us to paint a picture.      Bitcoin has succeeded in grabbing an impressively large chunk of American mindshare. However, common knowledge of bitcoin tends to be of poor quality. Nor does it translate into broad adoption. Although the proportion of bitcoin owners is higher than 2014, it still only registers at around 1% of the entire population. Bitcoin holdings tend to be quite small. Nor are these adopters using bitcoin for it's original purpose: electronic cash. Rather, they are investing and gambling with it, or tinkering with it.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | ETH | FIAT | LTC | TRADING,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/15/bitcoin-has-american-mindshare-but-few-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59716af79474ccfed413003e465020dfe63ea875-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The New York-based fund provider reportedhttps://grayscale.co/insights/grayscale-q2-2020-digital-asset-investment-report/ two consecutive record quarters Wednesday, with more than $400 million increase in capital inflows quarter-on-quarter.  Grayscale raised $500 million in Q1 2020 – the previous record.  Overall, Grayscale raised $1.4 billion in the first half of this year, the first time capital crossed the billion-dollar mark in a six month time frame, it said.  Grayscale is part of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  The firm creates single asset funds that allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies in a regulated asset-class.  This week's results mean total cumulative inflows into Grayscale's products since inception has more than doubled to $2.6 billion.  The vast majority of commits (85%) came from institutional investors in H1 2020; Grayscale said most have started diversifying away from just bitcoin.  Total capital inflows into altcoin products increased 35% quarter over quarter; it's up nearly 650% over the 12-month period.  Inflows into the Ethereum Trust made up 15% across the whole product range in Q2 2020: an all-time high.  Bitcoin trust inflows came to $751 million in the same quarter; Grayscale successfully registered it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January.

42432264,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBjhh,1594818000,Quantstamp Audit Greenlights Ethereum 2.0 Client Prysm for Launch,"Ethereum 2.0 client Prysm is “basically ready” to launch, Richard Ma, CEO of Quantstamp, said in a phone call with CoinDesk.      A technical thumbs up for Prysm from the smart-contract auditing firm comes after last week's announced push by network developers to launch the proof-of-stake (PoS) version of Ethereum before 2020 closes out.      Indeed, numerous perceived “delays” have frustrated community members as they await the overhaul promised in the network’s 2014 yellow paper.      Informal agreements between Ethereum developers that multiple network-ready clients needed to launch in concert have slowed efforts over the years. Nine such implementations are currently underway, including Prysm, in various programming languages.      Read more: Ethereum Developers Delay Berlin Hard Fork to Stem Client Centralization Concerns      In a recent Reddit AMA, ETH 2.0 researcher Justin Drake said that given the lack of client diversity and testing, the network would likely not launch until Jan. 3, 2021, the 12th anniversary of Bitcoin’s genesis block.      Drake and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin disagreed, saying the network should be able to launch before the close of 2020 “regardless of level of readiness,” Buterin said.      “Eth2 phase 0 is in some ways simpler than Eth1 and in some ways more complex: more complex PoS, but no complicated GPU-oriented PoW; more optimization required, but no complicated VM, etc etc. I'm inclined to say Eth2 phase 0 is a little simpler on-net,” he added.    'Low-level optimizations'    Prysm client’s code was “well-written and documented,” Quantstamp said in a blog post shared early with CoinDesk. The firm identified 65 issues relating to the granularity of timestamps, pseudo-random number generation and second pre-image attacks on Merkle trees.      Ma described the concerns as “low-level optimizations,” with 75% having been addressed already. Ten engineers combed over Prysm’s ETH 2.0 codebase, programmed in the Go language, for two months, Ma said.      “Over $28 billion USD worth of ether and other digital assets are potentially riding on the transition to proof-of-stake,” noted Ma in a company statement. “The migration of ether and the DeFi ecosystem to Ethereum 2.0 is a high-stakes process.”      However, where money is on the line, audits alone don’t greenlight code for launch. Eth 2.0 clients have joined various testnets to run simulations of Phase 0 throughout the spring months.    Altona testnet for Ethereum 2.0    Most recently, Prysm has joined three other clients (PegaSys’ Teku, Status’ Nimbus and Sigma Prime’s Lighthouse) in the ongoing Altona testnet. The testnet allows users to stake ether and practice validating transactions for Phase 0 of Eth 2.0 and was preceded by both the Schlesi and Witti testnets, among others.      Read more: Schlesi Testnet Is Latest Step in Long Road Toward Eth 2.0      “Altona is finalizing with the Eth 2.0 Phase 0 core protocol logic that will be launched later this year,” Prysmatic Labs co-founder Preston Van Loon said in a private message to CoinDesk.      Metrics from the Witti testnet analyzed in a June 25 paper by independent testnet hard-fork coordinator Afri Schoedon showed Lighthouse repeatedly outperformed other clients. That client is halfway through an independent audit as well, according to Sigma Prime co-founder Paul Hauner in a private message.      Schoedon looked at “beacon-chain node implementation” such as for synchronization time and database space, but noted that the race to Eth 2.0 is “not a competition” among clients.      “While this is not about calling out a winner, we should be encouraged to learn from the Sigma Prime team’s design decisions,” he said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/15/quantstamp-audit-greenlights-ethereum-20-client-prysm-for-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8885fbd23e43477018fc7189a136828c4decd25a-2560x1710.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, is trading near $9,240 at press time, representing moderate losses on a 24-hour basis.  The cryptocurrency has spent a better part of the last two months trading the narrow range of $9,000–$10,000.  The prolonged consolidation has pushed a key volatility metric to its lowest level since November 2018.  A big move could happen soon, possibly on the higher side, as on-chain data is painting a bullish picture.  The seven-day moving average of the number of active bitcoin addresses has risen to a 2.5-year high of 478,669, as per data source Glassnode, likely indicating increased demand for the cryptocurrency.  The percentage of bitcoin that hasn't moved in a year also jumped to a new record high of 62.12% on Tuesday – a sign of strong investor confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects.  Chainlink  LINK, an Ethereum ERC-20 standard token used to pay for services on the decentralized oracle network Chainlink, has risen by over 10% in the past 24 hours.  LINK is now trading above $8.15, up 78% on a month-to-date basis and up 364% for 2020.  The token seems to be benefiting from the buzz around decentralized finance (DeFi).  LINK's trading volume has now surpassed that of Ethereum’s ether token to become the third-most traded cryptocurrency in the last 24 hours, as per Messari.  With LINK’s price rising by over 300% this year, all 168,160 addresses currently holding the token are “in-the-money” or making a profit on their investments, according to IntoTheBlock, a blockchain intelligence company.  Aave  LEND token, the native cryptocurrency of the decentralized lending platform Aave, and decentralized technology platform Ontology’s ONT token have also gained over 10% in the past 24 hours.  Aave’s LEND token has increased by over 1200% so far this year due to a rapid increase in usage since the launch of mainnet in January.

42432281,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNBk9h,1594814149,First Mover: UK Economy Setback Renews Questions of Bitcoin's Resilience,"Bitcoin was born in early 2009, in the aftermath of a financial crisis, but until this year it had never actually been through one.      Here’s how that played out: Bitcoin plunged in March as the coronavirus pandemic spread, then quickly bounced back as market optimism returned along with trillions of dollars of monetary stimulus.      Now, cryptocurrency traders may learn how bitcoin reacts as a new sense of pessimism sets in: Hopes that the global economy will snap back in a V-shaped recovery are diminishing quickly.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Figures released Tuesday by the U.K. Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed that the world’s sixth-biggest economy’s recovery is coming much slower than analysts, including the Bank of England’s chief economist, had expected.      Monthly gross domestic product grew just 1.8% in May, well below the 5.5% clip expected by analysts. The pace of growth represented a fraction of the near-25% drop in GDP since the start of the pandemic, the sharpest in three centuries.      The question for cryptocurrency traders is whether bitcoin would sell off if the markets took another leg down, or if it’s more likely to rally due to expectations of fresh money injections from central banks and governments. Bitcoin is seen by many investors as a hedge against inflation, and unchecked money printing could theoretically reduce the purchasing power of major currencies like the U.S. dollar and the British pound.      “The economy was still a quarter smaller in May than in February,” said Jonathan Athow, a deputy national statistician for the ONS. Lockdown restrictions meant key parts of the economy “remained in the doldrums, with a number of areas seeing further declines.”      A second coronavirus wave this winter could put the U.K. economy under even more stress and cause long-term damage, analysts fear.      Bitcoin bulls remain optimistic, however. Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantitative Economics, told First Mover the cryptocurrency could continue to hold its value in a fresh downturn, even if traditional assets like stocks tumble anew.      “Based on network strength, ease of purchase/storage and proven resilience, bitcoin is well positioned to act as both an excellent store of value and hedge against fiat,” he wrote in a Telegram message.      As coronavirus cases continue to rise, it’s like the world is experiencing a second wave of economic malaise. In Singapore, for example, where border controls and social distancing measures remain in full-effect, GDP contracted 41% in the second quarter, following a 33% decline in the prior three months.      Global markets recovered quickly in April, partly because investors saw an opportunity to buy assets, including bitcoin, on the cheap. But with the possibility of a prolonged economic downturn – possibly even a depression – some assets are already beginning to track back.      In the U.S., states including California, Texas and Arizona reimposed lockdown measures, with steps that included shutting bars as the national death toll approached 140,000.      Markets are expected to take another hit as companies report second-quarter results. Data provider FactSet estimates a 45% decline in the combined earnings of S&P 500 companies, the most since the 2008 financial crisis.      So far bitcoin has remained largely unaffected by the deteriorating fortunes in the global economy. Its price has been notably sluggish over the past month, moving within a tight range between about $9,000 and $9,500. Its ATR – a volatility metric – is at levels not seen since the start of 2019.      While prices may not have skyrocketed, interest in bitcoin, particularly among retail investors, has remained steadfast. In an informal Twitter poll hosted by bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff on Monday, 57% of respondents – more than 14,000 people – said they would never sell their holdings, even if the price never went above $10,000.      Long-term sentiment analysis from TheTIE found positivity around bitcoin was at its highest in a year and a half.      More recently, the ebullience is nowhere to be found. TheTIE CEO Joshua Frank told First Mover the number of daily tweets about bitcoin has fallen below 25,000, close to a 2020 low.      “We really are not seeing a growing number of users tweeting about bitcoin,” he said via Telegram.      Talks about bitcoin being a new “digital gold’ have fallen flat as its price diverged from that of the yellow metal. Gold’s value shot up last week to a nine-year high of $1,800 an ounce.      Some bitcoin bulls believe, and not without reason, that the cryptocurrency’s price could rise in pretty much any plausible economic scenario – whether the recovery looks like a V, U or even an L.      But sentiment is a fickle, unpredictable thing, and without a compelling narrative, there’s a risk that bitcoin’s price could again start to sink.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,245 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,279 | 24-Hr Low: $9,125      Trend: Bitcoin is struggling to gather upside traction a day after carving out a bullish candle.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $9,250 at press time, representing moderate losses on the day.  Prices found bids below $9,100 on Tuesday before jumping over $200, forming a candle with a long lower shadow on the daily chart. Such candles are indicative of an impending bullish move. So far, however, the cryptocurrency has remained below Tuesday's high of $9,282.      Technical traders often wait for confirmation in the form of positive follow-through – preferably a break above the bullish candle's high – before hitting the market with bids. As such, a move above $9,282 could cause chart-driven traders to join the market, leading to a stronger rally to $9,500 and potentially higher.

The agreement, dated July 13, means Abramoff has pled guilty to charges of conspiring to commit wire fraud and to defraud investors.  Abramoff was at the center of a lobbying scandal in 2005 where he overcharged clients millions and used funds to make illegal political donations. He pled guilty, served nearly four years and was released in 2010.  In June 2017, Abramoff became marketing lead for the Las Vegas-based NAC Foundation to publicize the AML BitCoin initial coin offering (ICO).  The AML BitCoin token was marketed as compliant with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations; the project also said governments and public agencies were planning on adopting it.  Per the filing, Abramoff said he became aware that no public body was actually close to adopting AML BitCoin and that NAC Foundation CEO, Roland Marcus Andrade, had ""inappropriately"" taken $1 million from the project's funds.  But Abramoff said he reached an understanding with Andrade and continued to publicize the project as well as solicit investors to purchase tokens.  He claimed a promotion that claimed AML BitCoin's Super Bowl advertisement had been rejected by the NBC television network and the National Football League was false and misleading.  Abramoff has yet to be sentenced; he faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 penalty.  Andrade was indicted last month on money laundering and wire fraud charges; he told CoinDesk he was the victim of government corruption.

Mark Yusko, founder, CEO and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital, has joined Evertas' board of directors as part of the deal.  Evertas, which was formerly called BlockRe, says it offers a suite of services including risk audits, underwriting, investigations and claims handling.  The company is looking to provide cover for both cold storage (where coins are held on devices with no connection to the internet) and hot wallets (which are connected to the web), said Evertas spokesman Phil Anderson.  The target audience is institutional, according to Anderson. This includes insurers and brokers as well as institutional owners of crypto assets, exchanges, custody providers, funds, family offices and high-net-worth individuals.  Evertas did not say which custodians or insurance industry firms it is already partnered with by publication time.  Earlier this year, the firm received a license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority to operate as a ""Class 3A,"" or small commercial, insurer. It is required to maintain minimum capital and surplus of $1 million.

A report last Friday by La Tercera said the bodies, identified as Oscar Brito Ibarra and Ignacio Ibarra (apparently not related), had been found in suitcases by local police on June 30.  The suitcases were dumped on a vacant lot in Mazatlan in the region of Sinaloa, a seaside town located about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the country's capital, Mexico City.  The cause of death was suffocation, according to local police who are treating the case as a double homicide.  Oscar was a Chilean national while Ignacio came from Argentina.  Both men, who were known associates, had been kidnapped two days earlier in Villa Carey, another neighborhood in Mazatlan.  The two had been involved in promoting the crypto investment scheme OneCoin – called a fraud by prosecutors in the U.S. and elsewhere – throughout Latin America.  They had reportedly convinced numerous individuals to invest in OneCoin through an entity called the Latin American Automotive Marketing Company (CLA), which accepted cryptocurrencies for car purchases.  At CLA, Oscar and Ignacio promoted car sales to victims by claiming they could get better deals if they used the OneCoin system to make the purchase.  In June, the pair traveled to Mazatlan to promote CLA, but shortly after arriving the pair were found dead.  In November of last year, a jury convicted OneCoin's lawyer, Mark Scott, of laundering $400 million for the scheme.  An alleged leader of the scam, Konstantin Ignatov, has had his sentencing date adjourned for the second time while he continues to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors.

Bitcoin, which allows pseudonymous donations, would in theory be a lifeline for political activists. The reality, however, is more complex.    Presidential hopeful raises bitcoin    Leonid Volkov manages political operations for Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most prominent opponent. Navalny tried to run against Putin for president of Russia in the 2018 election but was ultimately barred by the Central Election Commission.      Navalny was nonetheless an impressive political fundraiser, including incrypto. Since December 2016, Navalny’s bitcoin wallet has raised 648 BTC. This money helped fund Navalny’s supporters in various locations across Russia as they ran for public office in their towns, investigated corruption in local governments, organized protests and so on. Navalny’s bid for the presidency ultimately failed, but his country-wide network of mobilized, loyal supporters is here to stay.      Read more: Bug in Moscow’s Blockchain Polling System Can Reveal How Users Voted: Report      Navalny started fundraising for his campaign in 2016, two years before the presidential election, when there was time to experiment, Volkov says. The elections that year had not yet been officially announced, so ordinary restrictions on how candidates can raise and spend money didn’t apply. Navalny’s team “took a chance” and opened a PayPal account and a bitcoin wallet – neither of which would normally be considered legitimate campaign fundraising vehicles.      “I don’t remember how much we raised back then, but bitcoin has never been more than 10%-15% of all our donations,” Volkov said.      According to the 2019 report by Volkov, out of 191 million rubles (approximately $2.7 million) donated to Navalny during the last year, only 9.7 million ($140,000) came via bitcoin.    'They’re pissed they can’t control it'    Volkov believes Navalny’s bitcoin donors are mostly IT workers and entrepreneurs who want to donate large sums without drawing the ire of the Kremlin.      Bitcoin donations are important for two reasons, Volkov explained.      “First, the average donation [in BTC] is higher and, second, this fundraising method is uncontrollable by the authorities. By being this way, it protects other methods, too,” Volkov said.      This may sound like a paradox but it has a certain logic. Russian authorities can freeze bank accounts, which has happened to Navalny and his allies in the past. But thanks to bitcoin there is an alternative fundraising channel that can’t be shut down. So why bother blocking channels when you know people can easily find another way?      “Our opponents understand they can’t cut us off from sources of funding because [if they try] at least a part of the donations will go into crypto,” Volkov says, adding: “Last time our accounts got frozen, we saw an uptick in bitcoin donations.”      Navalny’s bitcoin wallet is repeatedly mentioned by the Russian state-owned TV channel Russia Today to make the point the politician is using crypto to hide something suspicious.      Read more: Russian Courts Can’t Agree on Whether Crypto Is Property      “They are pissed off by the fact that the government can’t control it, so they go for any insane speculation,” Volkov comments.      Bitcoin can also work as a currency exchange tool, Volkov says. Navalny’s supporters abroad often use PayPal for donations, but withdrawing Russian rubles from a PayPal account is expensive. A cheaper way, it turns out, is buying bitcoin using the PayPal account and then selling it for rubles on a peer-to-peer platform like LocalBitcoins, Volkov says.      This can lead to trouble, however. The team put the fiat proceeds from the bitcoin sales into bank accounts to pay salaries, rent and other expenses, Volkov said. But this activity looked like money laundering to law enforcement and became one reason for a criminal case against Navalny and his staff.      Nevertheless, Volkov sees bitcoin as a useful tool.      “If you see your bank accounts start getting frozen, you can take your money out in crypto and keep it there until the dust settles,"" he said.      Bitcoin still isn’t much use for real-life purchases, however.      “You can’t pay your office rent and rally equipment in bitcoin. There is no market of goods and services available for bitcoin for us, so we just immediately sell it for fiat,” Volkov says.    Adoption problem    Navalny’s use of bitcoin, even with its limitations, is an exception to the rule. There are no other publicly known crypto fundraising campaigns at that scale. For some smaller fundraisers, bitcoin donations don’t have a major impact.      “Russian civic organizations rarely use crypto as a crowdfunding tool,” says Elia Kabanov, a Russian science writer and blogger. One reason is that it’s not easy to organize systematic work with crypto, as most accountants don’t know how to deal with it, he says.      Roskomsvoboda, an organization tracking internet censorship in Russia, has been raising donations in crypto since 2012. However, even among its internet-savvy and privacy-valuing supporters, not that many people are willing to donate crypto. According to Sarkis Darbinyan, Roscomsvoboda's co-founder, crypto donations have been sporadic and generally doesn't exceed 20% of total money raised.      There’s also the risk that crypto donations will attract the attention of law enforcement, as happened with Navalny. Plus, donations in crypto can not be used as a legal source of funding for an official political campaign, Kabanov says. Crypto is in a gray zone in Russia in general, with a regulation bill currently stuck in the parliament amid a lingering possibility of a broad-stroke ban.      But the most important obstacle is that not many people in Russia use crypto or are familiar with it.      Read more: Russia’s Ministry of Justice Latest to Criticize Proposed Crypto Ban      Crypto is “mostly for enthusiasts,” says Anton Yershov, head of staff at the Pirate Party of Russia, an unregistered party advocating for the easing of copyright laws.      “People see that in their everyday lives, they can’t buy many things for crypto; plus, there is no clear regulation [for crypto in Russia] and, also, it’s easier to send money from your debit card than take care of a [crypto] wallet,” Yershov says.      The Pirate Party is raising money in crypto, but it hasn’t been a huge success, Yershov says. When the group organized a conference for IT professionals, called CryptoInstallFest, people donated in crypto more than usual, Yershov said, but it still didn’t add up to much.      Part of the problem is economic: Most Russians don’t have any savings at all, statistics show. The COVID-19 pandemic doesn’t help.      “People have been scraping the bottom since March,” Yershov said. This could make people less likely to dip into volatile crypto markets.    Easy fiat    “In Russia, people mostly use crypto either to get around the law, or IT workers use it for their personal purposes. But an ordinary donor who has a debit card or some money on his cell phone balance won’t use crypto to donate,” says Alexander Elkin, an IT worker at the fund Russia Behind Bars.      The fund helps people who can’t afford lawyers, have a family member unfairly imprisoned or who have left prison with nothing but the clothes on their back. Started by the journalist Olga Romanova as a small group of women whose husbands were sent to jail for what they claimed were bogus charges, the movement grew into a fund with its network of lawyers and volunteers, and even education projects for prison inmates.      Russia Behind Bars has also consistently annoyed penitentiary authorities with reports of bad conditions and torture in Russian prisons, including a poor response to the COVID-19 pandemic.      This summer, the bank accounts of Russia Behind Bars were frozen. The only means of crowdfunding left are the electronic payment service Yandex.Money, PayPal and crypto. Russia Behind Bars has crypto addresses for bitcoin, ether, litecoin and XRP on its donation page.      Yandex.Money, owned by Russia’s most popular search engine provider, is fairly popular in Russia and neighboring countries, but the service is not beyond the reach of the Russian authorities. In 2017, Navalny’s account for donation at Yandex.Money was blocked.      PayPal is not very popular among Russians because it’s relatively easy to send money between domestic bank accounts, and it recently announced it would stop providing domestic transfers in Russia starting August. Russian banks normally allow their clients to transfer money immediately, using a mobile banking app and a phone number of a receiver.      Read more: Russia’s Economy Ministry Calls for ‘Controllable Market’ Rather Than Crypto Ban      If Russia Behind Bars ends up with all its fiat gateways blocked, Elkin says he might think about a tool that would allow people to buy bitcoin and donate it to the organization. There is no urgency at the moment, but that could change if pressure grows.      Just three years ago, Russia Behind Bars used its bitcoin wallet to cover expenses such as airplane tickets and hotels even in remote parts of Russia, when the volunteers needed to visit people in faraway correctional colonies, according to founder Olga Romanova.      But then the situation changed, and now the vendors are more wary of accepting crypto, especially after the Bank of Russia issued a letter in 2017 saying it sees allowing crypto payments and trading in Russia as “premature.” Now, only IT-related expenses, like computer software and the salaries for two IT workers at Russia Behind Bars are paid in bitcoin, Romanova said.      “We’re not cashing bitcoin out. It’s hard enough to explain to the general public why there are investigations against us, and when there is crypto involved… [it would get even harder]” Romanova said.      Another roadblock is there is no readily available software that would allow automatic regular donations, like via a subscription, says Roman Dobrokhotov, formerly a political activist and now the editor-in-chief of the investigative outlet The Insider. But the future might make crypto donations more relevant, for non-technical reasons.      “If the authoritarianism [in Russia] gets stronger, [crypto donations] might become more popular, people will be moving into this uncontrollable segment,” Dobrokhotov says.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/15/russian-activists-use-bitcoin-and-the-kremlin-doesnt-like-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/403800bf8dd9b021c8444a78cbed1b323ea993b8-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The main thrust of the bulletin, dated May 1, is that criminals and foreign adversaries of the U.S. “likely” use hedge funds, private equity and other investment vehicles to circumvent financial institutions’ anti-money-laundering (AML) procedures.      One of the four examples given by the FBI analysts involves a “fraudulent cryptocurrency investment scheme.” While the scheme is never named, the story told in the bulletin bears a striking resemblance to the OneCoin case.      Read more: Jury Convicts Crypto Ponzi Scheme OneCoin’s Lawyer on Fraud Charges      For example:    The FBI says “an identified former partner of a major U.S. law firm assisted others in laundering more than $400 million” in proceeds for the unnamed scheme. In November of last year, Mark Scott, a former partner at Locke Lord, was convicted of laundering that much on OneCoin’s behalf.  The unnamed lawyer in the FBI memo moved the funds through “a series of purported private equity funds holding accounts at financial institutions, including those in the Cayman Islands and the Republic of Ireland.” Prosecutors described such maneuvers by Scott in those same jurisdictions.  “The underlying source of funds, the perpetrator of the cryptocurrency scheme, was not disclosed to the bank during the initial due diligence review,” the FBI bulletin says, not naming the bank. Prosecutors accused Scott of hoodwinking the Bank of Ireland in this same way.    The FBI cited public information as well as “a human source with direct access” in its account. The bulletin's other three examples of money laundering through private funds do not mention crypto.      Reuters first reported on the bulletin Tuesday. The bulletin is unclassified, but “law enforcement sensitive,” meaning it’s not supposed to be shared outside the federal government without FBI permission.      While OneCoin was a scam, the veiled references to Scott’s crimes in the FBI bulletin are a salient reminder that banks, not cryptocurrencies, were used to launder the ill-gotten gains.

42384131,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0ao1,1594800062,NYDFS Chief Calls Industry Reaction to BitLicense Changes 'Beyond Positive,"The crypto space has reacted positively to the new changes made to the BitLicense, Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), said Tuesday.      Discussing recent updates to the state’s contentious crypto regulatory framework as part of the Global Leaders Webinar Series sponsored by Global Digital Finance (GDF) in partnership with Global Blockchain Business Council, Lacewell said some in the space may “curse” the regulator, but the new changes have been received rather well.      “The reaction has been very positive, and beyond positive,” she said.      The session was hosted by Jeff Bandman, former fintech adviser to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).      Lacewell said she was not surprised by the industry’s reaction to the updates because the regulator worked on the license in confidence with industry players – both licenced and unlicenced – and experts to understand its shortcomings.      “We've even had some licensees tell us that they're very excited and interested in pursuing additional licencing with other potential parties that are all partners in the space,” Lacewell said.    Crypto hub?    Lacewell said when she first took office last year, she immediately assigned personnel to work through a backlog of BitLicense applications that needed reviewing and that she has made numerous application decisions since then.      For instance, it took European crypto exchange Bitstamp four years after submitting an application to receive a license. Since Lacewell was appointed in June of 2019, six entities have received NYDFS accreditation.      “But then, beyond that, the area felt a little stale. And I thought to myself, we're coming up on five years of having this licence and we need to take a fresh look,” Lacewell said. “I was very conscious of the criticisms about the licence and that it wasn't pragmatic and that it favored a select few and they had to have a lot of money to get into the space.”      Lacewell added the department had not put out much in the way of guidance to help companies navigate the “complicated application” for the license.      “We knew that, at a bare minimum, we needed to clarify and explain the regulatory regime and the licencing application,” Lacewell said.      Since then, her office has made a number of changes to the Bitlicense including creating a conditional license designed not to burden startups with the heavy costs of applying for a full BitLicense. Instead, they can partner with existing licensed entities to legally operate in New York.    The regulator is also allowing licensed companies to self-certify virtual currencies, and has issued guidancehttps://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/virtual_currency_businesses/gn/adoption_listing_vc on coin listings for licensed platforms. To encourage innovation in the space, NYDFS has entered into a partnership with the State University of New York that would allow anyone to work on innovative projects or ideas by visiting one of the 64 SUNY campuses around the state.    During the webinar, Lacewell said she wants the industry to work.      “Look, when it first started, people said fly-by-night, crazy idea, flawed [and] worse, right? But there are responsible actors in the marketplace. Any financial service or product can be abused, misused and turned into a bad instrument,” Lacewell said.      Finally, Lacewell said NYDFS wants innovators in emerging technologies across the board to locate in New York and flourish.      “We want innovators right here in New York, which has been the birthplace of so much invention and ingenuity, historically, and has always set the standard not just for the rest of the country but the world. That's what it means to be the birthplace of immigration, because change agents come here and we want you here,” Lacewell said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/15/nydfs-chief-calls-industry-reaction-to-bitlicense-changes-beyond-positive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ddf40a57c40791073eb1a02e71b55d11145e2b6-2397x1372.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
