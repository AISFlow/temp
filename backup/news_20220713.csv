Will buyers cushion this downfall to restart a positive trend? Key technical points: The Fantom market price has decreased by 23% since last week. The price action shows a descending triangle pattern in the daily chart. The 24-hour trading volume of FTM is $154.2 Million, indicating a rise of 25%. Past Performance of FTM The FTM prices continue to fall under the influence of a bearish resistance trendline accounting for a downfall of 50%.

Fed Futures Traders Now Betting on 100 Basis Point Interest Rate Hike After CPI Release  Traders of Federal funds on the CME exchange now see a 67% likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise the target interest rate by 100 basis points, or one full percentage point, to 250-275 basis points this month, up from only 7.6% a day prior and 0% a week prior.  The odds of the Fed reprising June’s 75 basis point hike to a target rate of 225-250 is down to 33% from 92.4% a day ago.  On Wednesday, the Labor Department released the CPI, the most widely tracked measure of inflation, showing the highest inflation gauge in four decades.  “The fresh inflation high could give central bankers the green light for another aggressive rate hike. The Fed has prioritized the battle to stabilize prices over any push for economic growth at this point in time,” Helene Braun reported.

The Negative CPI was found to be 9.1%, the largest inflation increase in the US in the previous 40 years. The Federal Reserve&apos;s monetary policy is determined by the CPI, which is a reliable indicator of inflation. Negative CPI Report Causes Bitcoin To Tumble Prior to the release of U.S. inflation statistics on July 12, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) settled into a solid holding pattern, which ultimately added more negative volatility.

42374264,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYqfD,1657742421,Former Crypto Adviser Michael Barr Confirmed as Top US Financial Watchdog,"Michael Barr, a former Ripple adviser, is set to assume one of the most important U.S. regulatory roles after winning Senate confirmation to be vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve.  Barr, who was a key Treasury Department official during the administration of former President Barack Obama, will take over as the leading U.S. banking watchdog, where he’ll have a say in how the traditional financial system interacts with cryptocurrencies – especially stablecoins, the lifeblood of crypto transactions.  President Joe Biden nominated Barr in April for what could be the most powerful job in financial regulation. The Senate confirmed his nomination Wednesday in a66-28 vote. The Fed supervises Wall Street banking and – since the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act – also has a duty to oversee nonbank financial firms that play an outsized role in the financial system. Though he’ll technically be outranked by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the chairman has said publicly that he’ll defer to the vice chair on financial oversight matters.  Barr will have an influential voice in global standard-setting organizations and at home on the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is considering how to approach stablecoins. If that council of agency chiefs formally declares the tokens a systemically important financial activity, the group can push member agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate them. Barr will also be arriving in the wake of the terraUSD implosion, which could lend some fuel to the government’s efforts to put up guardrails.  Barr, who is currently the public policy school dean at the University of Michigan Law School, will also arrive at the Fed with a significant crypto background, having served on the advisory board at Ripple Labs. When he took that job in 2015 he said that he thought ""innovation in payments can help make the financial system safer, reduce cost and improve access and efficiency for consumers and businesses alike.”  However, the crypto industry may not be assured that an unabashed ally is taking the wheel. Barr is widely seen as a consumer advocate who supports aggressive regulation, favoring the interests of individuals over financial firms. And there’s some record of his crypto doubts.  A 2020 paper he co-authored cited research that assets such as bitcoin (BTC) “not only generate huge mining costs, but are also inefficient in their long-run design.”  During his tenure, the Fed is also expected to decide whether to issue a digital dollar – a move that could send shockwaves through the crypto industry. Barr’s academic work has suggested a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could boost the government’s financial inclusion aims. If such a CBDC is produced, its effect on private, dollar-based stablecoins could be profound.  Barr's confirmation enjoyed wide bipartisan approval, with a number of Republicans voting to give him the job. Such an outcome wasn’t necessarily assured for this key financial post. The previous nominee – Sarah Bloom Raskin, another Treasury veteran who had already served on the Fed board – had to withdraw after vigorous opposition.

42394522,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAVG1,1657741701,What Are the Four Kinds of Blockchains?,"You may have come across the term “blockchain” on social media or online news covering cryptocurrency or during a conversation on the future of technology. In a nutshell, blockchain serves as a shared, unchangeable, digital record of pieces of information (such as transactions) stored in computers or servers.  See Also: What Is Blockchain Technology?  Benefits of blockchain  Both blockchain and cryptocurrencies are frequently associated with each other by definition, because cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to exist. They aren't the same, but the blockchain technology that underpins crypto does offer many benefits, including the following:  Security  Transparency  Automation  Efficiency  Cost reduction  Four kinds of blockchain  Public  A public blockchain is permissionless, meaning it is fully decentralized and anyone can participate in it. This allows users with an internet connection to access, download and join the blockchain as an authorized node. All the nodes within the blockchain have equal rights to access and interact with the network. This kind of blockchain is often used for exchanging and mining cryptocurrency. The most widespread consensus mechanisms used in public blockchains are proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.  Pros of a public blockchain:  Open to the public – Anyone can access the network.  Pseudonymous - You are not required to reveal your identity to be able to participate.  Decentralized –No central authority maintains the network.  Transparent –Anyone can have full access to the ledger at any given time, eliminating the chance of corruption or discrepancies within the network.  Immutability –Once blocks are created and inserted, it is practically impossible for anyone to change and manipulate the blockchain.  Rewards -As a miner or validator, you can earn rewards by discovering new blocks or for validating transactions on the blockchain network, depending on the consensus mechanism.  Cons:  Not suitable for sensitive or proprietary data – A public blockchain doesn't have user permission mechanisms to hide data from certain entities, people or the public. For instance, if the blockchain needs to record personal medical or financial information, it would be visible to anyone anywhere in the world.  Scalability issues – These networks can become slow, clogged and expensive. Blocks hold a finite amount of data, and because anyone can use a public blockchain to send and receive transactions (data), the network can become clogged. When there is a lot of activity on a blockchain, it can take a while for transactions to process and network fees can skyrocket.  Examples of public blockchains:  Bitcoin  Ethereum  Private  A private blockchain is ""permissioned,"" meaning only some people are allowed to participate in it. This kind of blockchain is controlled by a company or organization, which determines who is granted access and enables read and write access to permissioned users on the network. The size of the private blockchain is generally smaller because it is a restrictive environment. As such, a private blockchain functions within the network of the controlling entity.  Pros:  Privacy – Private blockchains prioritize privacy, security and confidentiality of all the data stored within the system.  Speed and scalability – With fewer nodes and participants who can control the network, the system can support more transactions per second and make the decision-making process faster.  Security – Unlike public blockchains, private blockchains are highly protected against illegal activities, because of their rigorous authentication process for members to participate.  Cons:  Not completely decentralized – Private blockchains rely on a centralized system and on third-party management systems.  Example:  Ripple’s RippleNet  Hyperledger Fabric  Hybrid  A hybrid blockchain is a kind of blockchain network that combines features of both public and private blockchains. The blockchain network is controlled by one entity. It provides an organization with control over who can access specific data stored in the blockchain and what data will be open to the public.  For instance, XinFin’s hybrid blockchain makes it versatile in solving any underlying challenges within the finance and global trade sectors.  Its current blockchain infrastructure has both a public and private state. XinFin’s private state ensures that sensitive financial data remains secure, while the public state makes data transparent and verifiable.  Xinfin’s system has been used for remittance, peer-to-peer trading platforms, blockchain-powered insurance and online digital asset-linked identity, showing the versatility and various use cases of a hybrid blockchain.  Furthermore, members of the hybrid blockchain can also decide who can engage within the blockchain and which transactions are revealed to the public.  Pros:  Closed ecosystem – This kind of blockchain works in a closed ecosystem, allowing private information to be maintained and verified within the network but not available outside of it.  Flexibility – Hybrid blockchain offers a flexible process of customizing the ledger according to your own needs and the needs of the network.  Privacy with communication – The hybrid blockchain protects users from privacy-related issues but still allows third-party communications, specifically to shareholders and the public.  Better scalability – The scalability of this blockchain can be better than public blockchains, and its transactions are cheaper because it uses a few nodes to verify the transactions.  Cons:  Lack of transparency – This blockchain lacks transparency, because the information stored cannot be accessed sometimes.  Lack of incentives – Participants within this network won't be given rewards for their contribution to the blockchain like miners in a public blockchain.  Slow upgrades – Upgrades and development can be a challenge for this network. It lacks the prerogative to undergo the extensive and challenging adoption process.  Example:  IBM Food Trust  XinFin  Consortium  A consortium blockchain or a federated blockchain is more decentralized than a private blockchain. Unlike the hybrid blockchain with one controlling entity, a consortium blockchain is designed by a group of multiple entities that want to use a decentralized network to collaborate. Users outside of the consortium cannot get access to the blockchain network.  One of the largest systems using the consortium blockchain is R3, which includes Fortune 500 companies among its member entities. The purpose of R3’s network is to promote collaboration globally among organizations, such as creating apps built on their network.  Pros:  Security – Information on the chain isn't accessible to the public; only the participants of this network can access the information.  Control – This blockchain isn't controlled by one authority. Instead, a particular group of authentic participants of the network has control over the blockchain.  Validation – In this blockchain, the number of participants is known and verified. Authentication is conducted to reduce the risks of data and privacy threats.  No transaction fee – As opposed to other blockchains, this network charges no service or transaction fees to its participants.  Cons:  Framework – This blockchain lacks the features of a unified framework, and with its centralized network structure, the blockchain is vulnerable to participants who are secretly corrupt.

The price of AVAX/USD is $17.3, down 0.88 percent in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $386,157,015. The market topped the previous day in a dramatic surge and is now opening with encouraging bullish indications, adding to yesterday&apos;s spike above the $17.5 barrier. In addition, volatility drops, offering bulls more room for a spectacular comeback. AVAX&apos;s lice market cap is $4,981,055,698 and it ranks #16 in crypto ranking. AVAX/USD 4-Hours Analysis Following a downward trend, Avalanche technical analysis in a 4-hour trend indicates market volatility that is increasingly prone to fluctuate. The Bollinger Band Upper Limit is $19.4, which serves as AVAX&apos;s primary resistance level. The lower limit for the Bollinger&apos;s band is $16.5, which serves as AVAX&apos;S most crucial support. AVAX/USD appears to have crossed over the Moving Average curve, suggesting a bullish trend. Bears, on the other hand, have been in control of the market for the past several hours and will continue to do so. The price, on the other hand, appears to be declining in its movement towards support, and if the bulls do not get their act together, the trend may soon break and shift to a bearish one.

42421494,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUxR,1657739163,The Fed Can't Whip Inflation Alone,"Wednesday’s U.S. inflation numbers came in higher than Wall Street economists’ expectations, with the overall Consumer Price Index rising a shocking 9.1% over the past twelve months. Total inflation surged in June, up a dramatic 1.3% on a month-to-month basis compared to a 1.0% rise in May. Prices minus food and energy, or core inflation, were more restrained, rising 5.9% for the trailing 12 months, and accelerating just slightly from 0.6% in May to 0.7% in June.  Financial markets dropped on the news, but fairly modestly: The Dow Jones and Nasdaq Composite indexes were both off less than 1% Wednesday morning. That’s partly because the Biden White House already signaled the high print yesterday, nudging equity indexes down a bit under 1% before the July 11 close.  Crypto responded a good bit more dramatically, with bitcoin (BTC) slashing more than 3% immediately on the CPI figures and ether (ETH) bleeding more than 4%. This more reflexive nature of crypto likely reflects a couple of things: the assets’ more speculative nature makes it more vulnerable to rate hikes, and crypto’s greater concentration among retail holders may mean there’s generally less foresight in the market.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal news stories in crypto. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here  Inflation is many things  Inflation is bad for an economy for a lot of reasons. Most fundamentally, inflation creates uncertainty among investors and spenders because it makes it harder to plan ahead.  But financial markets, whether crypto or equity, are generally less worried about inflation’s direct impact on Main Street than about the Federal Reserve’s response via the money supply, aka its overnight interest rate. The muted equities drop so far, even on higher-than-expected numbers, reflects that the Fed has already announced an aggressive schedule of interest rate hikes, plans that have already pushed equity markets down nearly 15% since their January peak. In the parlance, even a higher-than-expected CPI result was to some extent already “priced in.”  One takeaway is that markets seem primed for significant bumps if future CPI numbers come in under expectations. A deeper look at Wednesday’s numbers, and at the real world, suggest we could indeed begin to see the inflation curve bending back towards earth.  Above all, that’s because about half of the top-line inflation came from one source: fossil fuels. Other categories are elevated: food, for instance, saw a 1% monthly rise vs. 0.5% in December of last year. But energy categories have skyrocketed: Gasoline went from a 1.3% monthly rise in December to 11.2% in June. The price of home natural gas actually flipped from a 0.3% decline in December to an 8.2% rise in June.  That’s likely a product of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and accompanying sanctions against Russian oil. The same factor would indirectly drive food and other inflation because petroleum and gas impact other costs in the form of things like transportation, plastics and fertilizer.  Is the inflation curve already bending?  The good news, as the Biden White House took pains to highlight Tuesday ahead of the CPI numbers, is that gasoline prices have declined since the June data was compiled. U.S. prices at the pump have dropped for 28 days in a row, from a peak national average of $4.92 per gallon on June 1 down to $4.62 today, according to GasBuddy data. That’s still massively up from an average of $3.16 in June of last year, and prices for refined gasoline don’t entirely track natural gas or overall energy prices. But the bending gasoline curve could be a big indicator that overall inflation is actually leveling off or even dropping as you read this.  Prices of other significant upstream commodities have also moderated, notably including wheat and copper. On the one hand, that’s incredibly good news. The war in Ukraine in particular had raised early worries of a massive global food shortage, but after spiking in March wheat prices are moving significantly back towards prewar levels. There has already been significant damage, particularly in Sri Lanka. But if prices keep correcting, we may dodge (for now) the worst-case scenario for the developing world.  Under normal circumstances, declining commodity prices would have an ominous downside, suggesting macroeconomic weakness or a looming global downturn. Some bears are making that case now, but I think it’s a mistake. Remember, we’re coming down from elevated prices between January and June. Dropping commodity prices right now are less about a macro recession and more about reversion to the mean after a period of uncertainty. (Similarly, a dropping stock market does not directly reflect the real economy.)  Not just the money printer  Finally, those granular numbers also highlight a degree of absurdity in the Fed’s role as arbiter of U.S. (and to an extent global) price levels.  In a perfect world, the focus of the current crisis would be on policy intended to fight rising energy prices, including things like national conservation programs. The Biden administration has made some moves to address this specific issue, including releasing strategic petroleum reserves and using the bully pulpit to pressure refiners to cut gas prices.  But those are piddling steps compared to the power of Fed rate setting. The problem, of course, is that rate setting is an entirely untargeted yoke on the economy and will constrain demand not just for fossil fuels, but for everything.  In some sense it’s not as much of a blind misstep as it might seem, because there are plenty of non-inflation reasons to lift interest rates: Rates too close to zero have dangerous implications for resource and risk allocation. A significant part of the current deflation of equity and crypto markets alike was set up by years of very low interest rates leading to misallocation of capital. Raising rates now should, in theory, help set up a more careful future investing environment.  Nonetheless, we can’t continue to rely on the Fed’s mathematical levers to fix challenges in the real economy – or to simplistically blame money printing for inflation. There are a lot of other factors, and the solutions are more about real-world policy than blanket financial re-engineering.  I know that first hand because I live in New York City, where we’re not reliant on automotive transportation and where power providers have pursued non-fossil fuel energy sources over the long term. This is strictly anecdotal, and I do hate to rub it in, but my transportation costs and rent have not gone up at all over the past three years, and my electric bill is up only modestly.  I’m living with the same Fed as the rest of the U.S., but things other than the money supply do in fact matter.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Has Been Going Up In Recent Weeks As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the current BTC whale ratio value suggests whales are still selling large amounts. The &apos;exchange whale ratio&apos; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top ten Bitcoin transactions to exchanges and the total exchange inflows. In simpler terms, what this metric tells is how much of the total inflows to exchanges is contributed by the whales (the ten largest transactions are assumed to be from whales). When the value of the ratio is high, it means the whales are making up for a large part of the inflows right now. Such a trend can be a sign of dumping from these humongous holders, and hence can be bearish for the crypto. Related Reading | Glassnode: Bitcoin LTHs Who Bought During 2017-2020 Aren&apos;t Selling Yet On the other hand, low values of the metric can suggest whales are selling at a healthy rate right now.

Walk into any SoulCycle in any of the same interchangeable global cities and you will be bombarded with quasi-religious messaging imprinted on the walls, comparable to the Arabic inscriptions in Istanbul's Hagia Sophia:  “We aspire to inspire … Change your body. Take your journey. Find your soul.”  Davis Richardson is a Web3 media strategist who has written for the New York Observer, New York Post, The Daily Beast, VICE, Paradox Politics and Wired. He owns bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.  Just as the Catholic Church exploited followers’ fears of endless damnation by selling indulgences, SoulCycle tells its customers they have no soul without the needed corporate remedy: Exercise classes on stationary bikes.  The fitness brand is hardly the outlier. In a global monopoly system lacking any ideological counterpart, companies battle one another for market share by converting competitors’ customers into followers. It isn’t enough to sell a good product: Companies must sell meaning in a world devoid of substance following the great ideological contests that characterized the 20th century.  Although corporatism has replaced religion, populations on a whole are skeptical of marketing tactics. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer, only 48% of Americans trust corporate messaging. It is very difficult for centralized companies to cultivate loyal followings selling authentic experiences and meaning, partly because the underlying motive is profit.  What is the Vatican but a collection of the world’s most iconic memes?  Companies looking to boost their following should deploy the Web3 playbook: Turn consumers into individual stakeholders and make them feel part of larger social movements. Doing so may even recalibrate corporate incentive structures and promote a culture in which everyone has something to contribute based on their skills and merits.  Web3 loves community … and free money  Web3 startups understand the importance of community. They grow followings united in a common vision via Telegram and Discord, offering “community members” – a different framing from customers or consumers – benefits like presale tokens and airdrops to incentivize regular engagement. While traditional startup founders hoard company equity like paranoid ghouls even from senior leadership, Web3 organizations rain virtual monopoly money on anyone who exhibits a fraction of loyalty.  A yearning for community and free money is at the heart of human nature.  Legacy brands can’t operate in a legal gray zone and risk breaking securities laws over some comically named cryptocurrency, but they can incentivize spending and offer loyalty rewards. Airlines and hotels already do this with different points systems, forming ""Disneyfied"" infrastructures with strategic partnerships in which points can be transferred and used for more experiences. Corporations funnel hundreds of millions of dollars into marketing and elaborate PR campaigns, but they rarely give pre-existing members no-strings-attached gifts and experiences.  Rather than treating customer acquisition like some Darwinistic contest that assumes human beings are either gullible idiots goaded into buying prepackaged services or evolved hunters safeguarding their resources by rejecting these attempts, companies should de facto emphasize community and regularly engage with members and reward them directly for being a part of it.  Memes drive advertising and iconography  The poet Allen Ginsburg famously wrote that whoever controls “the images, controls the culture.”  Successful Web3 startups understand the importance of bite-sized media invoking humor around key reference points that often conceal the real purpose of driving forward key company narratives. If brands have replaced religions as new secular mass movements, then memes are the modern day vehicles for recruiting followers and reinforcing narratives and ideology.  What is the Vatican but a collection of the world’s most iconic memes?  Within each Web3 ideological camp, certain customs are particular to each group, whether it's Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin's followers abstaining from seed oils or Bitcoin maximalists photoshopping laser eyes on their social media avatars. Memes reinforce these rituals while creating mythology around company founders. Unlike traditional corporate demographics, Web3 communities boast sycophantic, deranged followers willing to bet their entire financial well-being on whether a crypto lives or dies.  Founded in 2006, SoulCycle convinced affluent, young professionals lacking spiritual meaning to buy into a fitness lifestyle with ads reading “Find Your Soul.” Founded three years later in 2009, Bitcoin developers convinced entire countries to buy into a new global monetary system following Reddit memes of Morpheus in the Matrix hailing its greatness.  Mess is good  Perfectionists limit themselves from uncovering new ideas and creation methods. Traditional companies are likewise kneecapped by corporate hierarchies, office politics and bureaucratic red tape from innovating.  Web3 startups don’t have these inhibitors and can quickly adapt to the tailwinds of an emerging asset class evolving in hyper-speed over the internet. Getting messy and experimenting with memes and incentive structures allows founders to figure out better ways to scale their businesses and engage with their communities.  Whether it succeeds or fails, there is something more honest about colorful ideas deployed off-the-cuff than heavily market-tested corporate promotions.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Davis Richardson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/13/what-legacy-brands-can-learn-from-web3s-hyper-cultish-narratives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f453a0cb4e425f1a543602178e7b37d1b9c359e-2860x1560.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374269,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYqlV,1657734944,Wobble in stETH's Price Shows Fear Celsius Might Dump $435M Stake,"An obscure crypto-market metric known as the ""stETH discount"" is suddenly sending a distress signal, possibly because of speculation that the troubled lender Celsius Network is preparing to dump some of its holdings in a bid to raise liquidity.  The discount represents the difference between the price of ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, and the stETH token, which is a derivative of ether and is supposed to have a similar price.  But on Tuesday, the discount widened from 2.6% to 4%, the highest level since early this month. The figure remains below the all-time high of 8% recorded last month during the week when Celsius suspended withdrawals and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital blew up.  Market watchers are paying close attention to Celsius partly because the liquidity-strapped crypto lender is one of the largest single holders of the stETH token. So if it dumps its stake, the price of stETH could come under heavy pressure, even if the price of ether isn't affected.  The sudden impetus comes from blockchain data showing that Celsius on Tuesday paid off debt on the decentralized finance protocol Aave and in exchange received back 416,000 stETH tokens (worth $435 million at current prices) that had been pledged as collateral.  The stack represents almost 10% of the total supply of stETH, which stands at 4.2 million. The total market capitalization of stETH is $4.3 billion, according to CoinGecko.  “The stETH position poses significant price risk to the market among the yield-bearing collateral that Celsius had,” Fundstrat analyst Walter Teng told CoinDesk.  Read more: How Crypto Lender Celsius Overheated  How Celsius got trapped in stETH  The price gap between stETH and ETH has become a closely followed measure of the stress crypto markets have endured lately.  The stETH token represents 1 ether (ETH) token deposited to the staking platform Lido to earn a 4% annual yield for locking up in Ethereum’s upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain.  The caveat is that staked ETH cannot be redeemed in the foreseeable future, until well after Ethereum completes its transition to the ""proof-of-stake"" method of maintaining its network, a switch known as the Merge. Investors who stake ETH on Lido receive the equivalent in stETH tokens, which they can use as collateral to take out loans.  Celsius was one of the depositors on Lido, locking up its ETH to earn a yield and using stETH to ""recursively borrow"" on Aave, David Duong, head of institutional research at crypto exchange Coinbase, wrote in a report.  Read more: Crypto Market Chaos: No, Lido Is Not ‘the Next Terra’  Ether and stETH tokens changed hands at a one-to-one ratio up until the multibillion-dollar implosion of the Terra network and its UST stablecoin in May, which kickstarted a credit crisis among crypto firms.  Then, stETH's price further deviated from the price of ETH as crypto firms such as Alameda Research, Amber and insolvent Three Arrows Capital dumped their holdings in a sign of a liquidity crunch.  Celsius was among the firms that dumped the token, a report by blockchain data firm Nansen found.  The primary market those institutions used to get rid of stETH is an exchange pool on Curve, a DeFi platform where users can swap their tokens for ETH.  Yet the earlier round of stETH dumping left the Curve pool mostly drained and heavily imbalanced, shrinking to a fraction of the size it once had. At press time, it held about 150,000 ETH and 484,000 stETH, an imbalance with staked ether accounting for 76% of the liquidity while ether accounting for the rest.  This makes it impossible for Celsius to dismantle its 416,000 stETH position in the Curve pool alone, because there isn't have enough ETH tokens to swap into.  What Celsius might do with its stETH  Celsius is one of the slew of crypto lenders facing liquidity issues lately. Vermont’s Department of Financial Regulation alleged that the lender ""is deeply insolvent,"" while regulators in several other U.S. states have started investigations.  Read more: Looking at the Claims Celsius Operated Like a Ponzi  Celsius moved all of its publicly known stETH holding to an unknown wallet earlier Tuesday, as CoinDesk reported, raising questions about what it intends to do with it.  Last week, after paying off its debt to DeFi platform Maker to reclaim $440 million in wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) tokens, the lender deposited the tokens to crypto exchange FTX.  If Celsius wanted to pursue a similar strategy with its freshly unlocked stETH stack, it faces a more difficult challenge as the market for stETH is fragmented and the Curve pool is too shallow to unwind the position.  “To offload their stETH exposure, Celsius would have to carefully structure trades across DeFi, centralized exchanges and any counterparties they can find,” John Freyermuth, an analyst at Enigma Securities, told CoinDesk.  That might include seeking ""requests for quotations from over-the-counter desks that are willing to undertake this liquidity risk,” Fundstrat's Teng added, possibly at a discounted price.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/13/wobble-in-steth-price-shows-fear-celsius-might-dump-435m-stake,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/250f45857354b03628cbe0988e093d0d14e380c4-1137x845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421490,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUtJ,1657733548,Why We Need to Build Web3 Differently,"What do a 3D TV and a Web3 avatar have in common? No one asked if anyone actually needed these things. While the 3D TV is no longer around, numerous Web3 projects continue to emerge, despite any proof that they actually have everyday utility. If you look at who is building the products of Web3 and whose needs those products serve, you start to realize that the builders look a lot like the same people who built Web2.  Tricia Wang is a tech ethnographer designing equity into systems. She co-founded Crypto Research and Design Lab (CRADL) with Sheila Warren and Lauren Serota. Web3athon is open for submission to anyone until August 7, 2022. Sign up here.  I’m a huge proponent of the idea that Web3 is for everyone, but we are on track to repeating Web2 where we had a small class of people building tools for everyone globally.  Web3 is supposed to pick up where Web2 failed  Many of the problems we had with Web2 came down to a lack of representation and participation by people building and using the tools, an infamous example being Google’s photo image recognition algorithm tagging Black people as gorillas. Web2 leaders designed and built in the direction that made them profitable (based around an extractive ad model) putting people’s needs and experiences second.  Despite mounting evidence that diverse teams can lead to better, more inclusive products, many of today’s Web3 builders are just Web2 builders with a hexagonal Twitter profile picture. But unlike Web2, it’s much easier for someone to start learning about Web3 and build a product that anyone can use. At least, in theory.  Read more: Web3athon Challenges Consensus Delegates to Find Crypto Solutions to 'Hyperlocal' Problems  A key part of the Web3 promise is that the blockchain enables everyone to have sovereignty over their data, which is why Web3 is referred to as the “creator economy.”  That’s why in Web3 we need everyone to be a builder. Because when you control the use of your data (or your community’s data), you can do so much more with it. And being a builder doesn’t mean you have to write code (especially as we move towards a no to low-code Web3). It should also mean grokking the tech enough so that you can understand its use case scenarios and the larger environmental, social, policy and governance implications. But when so much of the Web3 dialog and headlines center around billionaires, scams and price volatility, it’s no wonder that some people may look at the industry and think “that’s not for me.”  Hackathons are where Web3 culture is built  At the Crypto Research and Design Lab (CRADL), a lab I co-founded and direct, we looked into what would enable more people to build community-centered Web3 use cases. We learned that hackathons (especially at conferences) play a big role in how products come to life. Chains dedicate entire departments to nurturing their developer ecosystems, with hackathons as a key activity to recruit and maintain talent.  But most hackathons follow behaviors typical of Web2’s typical creators: The focus of crypto hackathons is usually on building, not listening. Education at hackathons is centered on the technology, not the people using the technology, which creates a high barrier to entry even for new developers.  Related: Privacy, Social Media and the Reinvention of Company Towns (podcast with Tricia Wang)  As CRADL’s lead researcher of our product research Katherine Paseman explains, “In an industry like cryptocurrency where the stakes are people’s life savings, digital identity or pathway to financial freedom, it is worthwhile to avoid the Silicon Valley culture of 'move fast and break things.'”  So we asked ourselves: How do we design a new model of a crypto/Web3 hackathon that leads to a greater range of participants successfully applying Web3 tools that are centered on real needs from people and communities?  Make hackathons centered around people, not just technology  Based on our findings, we teamed up with CoinDesk and HackerEarth to create the Web3athon, a hyperlocal, people-first crypto hackathon that brings creatives and developers together to solve some of the most pressing problems facing communities.  Here are a few of our design decisions that any chain can implement in their hackathons. First, instead of continuing Web3’s focus on mass adoption, we chose to focus on the “hyperlocal” as the overarching theme because designing solutions for actual communities will ensure that products are people-centered from the start, which is the foundation of any successful use case. To focus participants even more, we then narrowed in on five pressing hyperlocal challenges that blockchain technologies are well suited to solve: generational wealth, financial health, sustainable culture and communities, environmental well-being and disaster response and relief.  Then we implemented a “people-first, chains second” approach. Most hackathons in crypto up until now have been single-chain. But what if the chain isn’t appropriate for your idea? What if all the people using your app have leapfrogged desktops and primarily use mobile phones? Then developing on a chain that is mobile-first is important. We made the Web3athon a multichain with 16 layer 1s, or base networks, and the first stage two months so that participants have enough time to understand the problem they are solving and learn about the chains. Our hypothesis is that multichain hackathons that are people-first will lead to ideas with faster and better product-market fit.  Lastly, we focused on inclusive language to ensure we were a welcoming for a broader range of participants. For example, instead of bounties, we have prizes. Prior to tech adopting the term bounties as the reward for hackers to find bugs, the U.S. federal government, states and private citizens offered financial bounties for people who caught runaway slaves, freed slaves or Native Americans. Even now, Texas’ abortion laws have a bounty component. Inclusive language efforts in tech have picked up in the last few years to examine legacy offensive terms. To make Web3 a place for everyone, we can start that effort now.  Just by implementing these few changes, we've already seen a greater range of hackathon participants enter. Lucy Edosomwan, a Nigerian American-born financial literacy educator, data analyst, and digital strategist (and contestant in Miss Nigeria USA) told us, “I’ve done hackathons like at MIT, but with the Web3athon I feel more connected to the mission of building hyperlocally and getting marginalized communities that aren’t represented in Web3 as actual builders.”  Ahmed Hamid, whose background in finance has led him to investment banking, aviation finance and nonprofit funding, has formed a team to develop Refound, a product to serve frontline and wartime journalists. Solar panel installation practitioner Jon Ruth said, “As a non-technical person I came away encouraged to jump in and sign up for the Web3athon. This was the first time I have felt welcomed into a hackathon as a nontechnical founder.""  Most importantly, we’re seeing projects that are being led by community leaders, built for their own community. Indigenous leader Henry Foreman, program director of New Mexico Community Capital, is launching IndigiDAO to support Native American entrepreneurs to provide access to investment, capital, grants and tokens in ways that will advance Indigenous core values, such as collaboration, reciprocity, shared ownership and nourishment-based exchange.  We’re also seeing more Web2 folks like startup founder Ronald Hernandez, an Ecuadorian-Venezuelan who is creating an e-commerce platform with Web3 solutions for small to medium-size businesses in Latin America. And Web3 developers are coming back to us to tell us the benefits of being at a hackathon that emphasizes listening before building. One developer told me under conditions of anonymity, “I travel all year for crypto hackathons, but the Web3athon is the first hackathon I went to where I was asked to slow down and actually listen. And I think that’s going to increase my chances of making a product that people want to use.”  What we're seeing so far has been encouraging for our thesis that hackathons are an ideal place to meaningfully shift the culture of Web3. By centering the event around community needs, more people from diverse backgrounds are inspired and empowered to build solutions.  And on the brink of a recession, it’s even more important now to demonstrate how Web3 innovation can benefit everyone. If Web3 is to emerge from this downturn with greater legitimacy, more buy-in from policymakers and more relevant solutions, then we need builders to learn how to listen to people’s experiences and make products that truly demonstrate the applications for blockchain technology.

Chapter 11 filing discussed. Cryptocurrency market health discussed. Days after Voyager Digital (VYGVF) issued a default notice to Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the firm halted withdrawals, deposits, and trading on July 1, 2022. On July 6, 2022, the company declared bankruptcy. Why did Voyager risk so many customer assets to threaten its liquidity? Why did Voyager demand to secure its loan to 3AC with assets? FSInsight effectively characterized 3AC as running a ""Madoff-Style Ponzi scheme"" . Before they disappeared , the founders made good use of their reputation to borrow from institutional lenders. This unfortunately included Voyager Digital. 3AC Cratered From Leverage Before the firm declared bankruptcy, investors who searched for 3AC learned that the firm had an estimated $10 billion in assets under management. After Voyager’s CEO, Stephen Ehrlich, looked at that huge sum, he, like many others, did not believe he would need assets to back loans of over $660 million . Within a few months, 3AC’s AUM shrank to $4 billion . The devaluation in crypto tokens hurt 3AC’s ability to pay its debt. On June 17, 2022, 3AC admitted that it had $3 billion worth of cryptocurrencies under management as of April 2022 . It invested over $200 million in Luna (LUNA-USD) tokens in February 2022. When Luna lost its peg to the dollar, Luna lost nearly all its value in about a week. Luna’s demise is due to the failure of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin (UST-USD). When unknown holders dumped large amounts of UST, the stablecoin started to depeg . Luna failed for two reasons. First, it offered between 1.00% and 14.31% in interest rates. At its height, Terra offered between 17% and 20% on UST. Second, Luna failed to limit withdrawals before peak selling. Voyager Digital is also guilty of offering excessive rewards. It signed an international deal with the Dallas Mavericks. To attract customers, it offered $100 worth of crypto awards . Voyager offered annual rates of between 8% to 10% on over 39 assets . Voyager Digital Voyager Halted Activity On July 1, 2022 In an attempt to learn from Luna’s mistake, Voyager halted withdrawals, deposits, and trading . CEO Stephen Ehrlich blamed poor market conditions. In addition, he said it would give the company more time “to continue exploring strategic alternatives with various interested parties while preserving the value of the Voyager platform we have built together.” Oddly enough, both Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) prices fell slightly and recovered. Could Voyager have averted a bankruptcy filing by waiting for those two coins to rebound? Data by YCharts Above: BTC and ETH prices in the last month compared to Coinbase and Voyager Digital. What could have been done does not matter. Voyager stated that it had $1.3 billion in crypto assets. It had more than $350 million in cash held for benefit of account for customers at Metropolitan Commercial Bank. The bankruptcy filing will protect its three divisions: Voyager Digital Holdings, Voyager Digital LLC, and Voyager Digital, Ltd. Among the companies that file for Chapter 11, around 25% will survive . During the lean times for the shale production market, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) filed for bankruptcy. It paid a heavy price by buying shale oil firm WildHorse Resource Development for $4 billion in 2019. When oil prices fell, the firm filed for bankruptcy. In February 2021, it emerged from bankruptcy . Voyager may survive, too. This depends greatly on the health of the cryptocurrency market. Layoffs In Crypto Sector On July 5, 2022, Celsius Network (CEL-USD) cut around 25% of its staff . It cut 150 jobs in an attempt to avoid insolvency risks. Celsius froze withdrawals in mid-June 2022 . Coinbase’s (COIN) CEO, Brian Armstrong, wrote on a blog post that the company would focus on driving greater operating efficiency. Product leaders will have insight into profits and losses. They will make decisions based on those figures. The job cuts are a red flag for the cryptocurrency platforms. Trading volumes will shrink considerably as Bitcoin and Ethereum prices risk falling to multi-year lows. FTX’s support for the crypto industry helped send Bitcoin back close to $22,500. The rally proved short-lived. Bitcoin prices fell below $20,000 . MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor still believes that Bitcoin is the best investment . He bought $10 million more Bitcoin . The market does not agree. Investors are accumulating the U.S. dollar as a safe-haven asset. The market has no appetite for taking risks. The Federal Reserve’s pace of interest rate increases is hurting lenders. It is forcing lenders in the crypto market to sharply cut down their excessive leverage. Your Takeaway The bullish calls on Voyager since September 2021 are wrong. CEO Stephen Ehrlich lent money to 3AC. The company likely sought high returns to fund its customer reward programs. 3AC then defaulted. Seeking Alpha Voyager was among over a dozen cryptocurrency ideas under research in the last year. Other stocks include mining firms like Hut 8 Mining (HUT). These days, I continue to watch the market through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Investors should not abandon the idea of holding a very small position of less than 2%. Historically, the crypto winter eventually ends. Investors should increase their interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum as prices fall. The financial system needs alternative crypto platforms. This introduces more competition and more choices for consumers.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4523122-how-3ac-took-voyager-digital-down-with-it?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7247.jpeg

This has led to struggles on the part of bitcoin to keep up its price. However, with so many events working against the crypto industry and a large number of investors pulling out of the market, the digital asset has had a hard time maintaining its price above its last cycle high. Bitcoin Falls Below $20,000 Bitcoin&apos;s price has now fallen below $20,000 for the third time this year with so many hurdles in between. After struggling to maintain $22,000, the bears had once again seized control, which resulted in another dip.

As the leading decentralized exchange on the Cosmos Internet of Blockchains, Osmosis has a head start over competitors. Osmosis is backed by a talented software developer team, and it has secured venture funding and support services from highly regarded investment funds. Osmosis continues to innovate, with plans to introduce front-running protection through an encrypted transaction queue later this year. Decentralized exchanges are one of the proven use cases of blockchain technology. A decentralized exchange enables investors to swap digital assets without an intermediary, such as a broker, in the middle of the transaction. Eliminating the middleman was the founding principle of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement that followed. Today, numerous decentralized exchanges exist across blockchain-software platforms. Decentralized exchange trading volumes sometimes rival centralized exchanges , such as Coinbase or Binance. Osmosis ( OSMO-USD ) is the leading-decentralized exchange on the Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ) blockchain ecosystem, which is designed to become the Internet of Blockchains. Disrupting Market Makers In traditional finance, market making is done by professionals working at banks, brokerages, and proprietary trading desks. These middlemen provide liquidity and execute trades on behalf of investors in exchange for earning the difference or ""spread"" between the bid and ask (i.e., buy and sell) price of an asset. Market makers ensure liquidity and thus a smooth flow of trades on the buy and sell sides of the market, facilitating the experience for investors. The open, permissionless nature of blockchain has revolutionized market making for crypto assets. Automated Market Makers ((AMM)), including Osmosis, use open-access liquidity pools instead of traditional, permissioned-access order books to provide liquidity and execute trades for investors. Users who provide liquidity receive the trading fees generated by the liquidity pool ((LP)), which is represented by an LP token (i.e., a receipt for providing liquidity into the pool). Below is a visual depiction of how these liquidity pools work, using Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and a generic Ethereum-based (ERC-20) token as the trading pair: James Bachini A permissionless group of users can deposit digital assets and provide liquidity into Osmosis pools, such as the Osmosis-Cosmos two-sided liquidity pair. These decentralized, user-generated pools are the source of liquidity for executing trades programmatically on Osmosis, which is connected to other Cosmos-based chains through the Inter-Blockchain Communication ((IBC)) Protocol. Eventually, Cosmos seeks to connect all major blockchains through the IBC Protocol, making Cosmos into the Internet of Blockchains. A Closer Look at Osmosis Osmosis is a layer one (i.e., base layer) blockchain with its own validator set that secures the chain through Proof-of-Stake consensus. Proof-of-Stake is environmentally friendly compared to the Proof-of-Work system used by Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Osmosis asset is used for staking to secure the network, on-chain governance, and transaction fees. Osmosis offers interoperability with other blockchains using IBC and Axelar . Osmosis seeks to compete directly with the user experience of centralized exchanges, such as Coinbase (COIN) or Binance ( BNB-USD ). Osmosis was created by Singapore-based Osmosis Labs , founded in 2021. Both co-founders, Sunny Aggarwal and Josh Lee , helped develop Tendermint , which is the core technology of Cosmos. Tendermint is one of the most widely used consensus engines in blockchain software. Mr. Aggarwal previously created a validator company, named Sikka , in Berkeley, Calif. Mr. Lee developed Keplr , which is the leading Cosmos-based, self-custodial wallet. Today, Osmosis Labs develops and supports Keplr in addition to Osmosis. Starting in June 2021, OSMO token emissions are allocated over nine years under a ""thirdening"" schedule like Bitcoin's ""halvening,"" whereby the rate of new coins created is cut in half every four years. New OSMO issuance is cut by one-third every year, and the supply gradually reaches a fixed total of one billion tokens, as shown below: Osmosis Labs New token emissions are allocated as follows: Data from Osmosis Labs (Further detail on token distribution is available in this Osmosis blog post ) The team deliberately chose to avoid listing OSMO on any centralized exchanges, since the project seeks to compete directly against these services. Accordingly, new OSMO buyers must know how to use a self-custodial crypto wallet like Keplr. One common route for new buyers is to acquire Cosmos on Coinbase or Crypto.com, send ATOM to a self-custodial Keplr wallet, then deposit and swap ATOM for OSMO on the Osmosis app . OSMO can also be obtained as a reward for providing liquidity and staking to secure the network. Variable staking rewards are about 30 percent annual percentage yield, as of this writing. Despite not being listed on any centralized exchanges, OSMO is ranked in the top 150 coins by market capitalization, according to Coin Gecko. In addition, the Osmosis exchange is ranked in the top 20 percent of 240 decentralized exchanges currently tracked by Coin Gecko , based on daily trading volume across all blockchains. Osmosis is number one in terms of dollar volume transferred across Cosmos chains using the IBC interoperability protocol, ahead of the Cosmos Hub itself, according to Map of Zones . Osmosis is open-source software built using the Cosmos Software Development Kit ((SDK)) under the Apache 2.0 License . Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Cosmos-based chains offer fast, environmentally friendly, low-cost transactions through Proof-of-Stake consensus. All OSMO holders may delegate their tokens to Osmosis network validators, who stake the tokens on a holder's behalf. Staking secures the network. Delegation is required to participate in on-chain governance and earn staking rewards, less a validator commission. If OSMO holders who delegate do not vote, they inherit the vote of their validator. Staking rewards can be claimed at the end of each daily epoch. OSMO stakers receive daily staking rewards from token emissions over the nine-year schedule and transaction fees indefinitely. Looking Ahead: A Long And Winding Road Initially, Osmosis has its own validator set securing the network and operates as a sovereign, base-layer chain within the Cosmos ecosystem. When the Cosmos Hub launches its shared security feature, which is expected in late summer or early fall 2022, Osmosis plans to pivot to become a shared-security client of the Cosmos Hub. This means that Osmosis would no longer be its own chain with its own validator set. Rather, Osmosis would become a client chain of the Cosmos Hub that uses the hub's validator set for security. This plan is subject to approval by on-chain governance, where one token equals one vote. After main net deployment and the initial OSMO distribution, the Osmosis Foundation treasury raised $21 million from a private token sale in October 2021. The participants were six accredited and/or institutional investors, including Robot Ventures, Nascent, Do Kwon, Figment, Paradigm, and Ethereal Ventures. Paradigm was the lead investor. Osmosis plans to introduce blockchain front-running protection by the end of 2022 through an encrypted transaction-memory pool. Osmosis would be the first decentralized exchange to implement this feature, according to co-founder Sunny Aggarwal . A secondary Osmosis-based token named ION (ION) has utility to be determined in the future. At network launch, ION was airdropped to ATOM holders who had voted in on-chain Cosmos governance or delegated ATOM to the Sikka validator. Security Incidents And Risk Considerations On June 7, 2022, Osmosis experienced an exploit of around $5 million from a bug in the latest software upgrade. The Osmosis blockchain was temporarily frozen through an emergency action taken by the network validators to stop further losses and provide time for remediation. The software code was fixed, and the chain is up and running without further incidents. Most actors involved in the exploit are cooperating to return misappropriated funds. The team plans to absorb any unrecoverable losses through the developer-team fund. Thus, no user funds will be lost. The Osmosis software code has not been audited, as of this writing. However, the first round of audits is under way . While there have been no regulatory actions taken against Osmosis Labs, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating a similar entity behind a decentralized-exchange platform named Uniswap. Osmosis has 135 validators, as of this writing. Out of 135, the top 10 validators control about 42% of OSMO delegated, based on data from the Keplr wallet web app. Thus, the network validator set is not as decentralized, based on voting power, as it could be given the availability of 135 validators. Greater decentralization would ensure that the network is more secure against attacks by a cartel of malicious validators. Conclusion Traditional market making is a lucrative business for banks, brokerages, and proprietary trading desks. Until blockchain, it was infeasible for individuals to participate in market making. A decentralized exchange like Osmosis cuts out the middleman and gives the value of crypto market making to users and investors. Osmosis is not only the leading decentralized exchange, but also the leading application-specific chain on Cosmos by interchain transaction value. The product roadmap includes compelling developments, such as front-running protection through a private, encrypted transaction queue. Osmosis is supported by a talented developer team, and it has secured venture funding and support services from highly regarded investment funds. Crypto investors seeking exposure to decentralized finance may want to take a position in Osmosis and also try using the protocol directly to learn more about this innovative application of blockchain technology.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4523117-osmosis-an-innovative-leader-in-decentralized-finance?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7245.jpeg

42394513,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAUaz,1657730835,Tezos: What Makes It Different?,"Tezos is a smart contract platform used to issue new digital assets and create decentralized applications (dapps). The project gained notoriety as one of the first blockchain-based projects to implement a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm over a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm used by Bitcoin.  Despite newer projects like Solana and Cardano implementing PoS, and Ethereum transitioning from PoW to PoS, Tezos continues to develop other aspects of its platform.  So what makes Tezos different?  Overview of Tezos  Tezos was founded in August 2014 by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, who published a position paper under the pseudonym L.M. Goodman. The Breitmans followed up the position paper with the official Tezos white paper, which highlighted the platform’s functionality using its native cryptocurrency, XTZ. According to the white paper, XTZ enables Tezos’s smart contract functionality and gives holders the opportunity to participate in on-chain governance.  XTZ is an inflationary asset with a fixed issuance rate of around 5.51% and an uncapped token supply. By inflationary, more XTZ is generated over time due to its PoS consensus mechanism. PoS consensus mechanisms reward users (known as validators) for confirming transactions and fine validators for acting maliciously. Both fines and rewards are paid in XTZ, which makes the token supply increase over time.  Due to the open-source nature of the platform, Tezos is decentralized from any single entity and developed by the community. To best support the community, the Tezos Foundation was created following the XTZ token launch in 2017. The Tezos Foundation is responsible for supervising the platform’s development and ensuring its long-term success. Through community development and support from the Tezos Foundation, Tezos has developed into a unique blockchain that functions similarly but works differently from other PoS blockchains.  What makes Tezos different?  What makes Tezos different from other blockchains can be briefly summarized by three main points:  Energy efficiency: Tezos has an annual carbon footprint approximately equivalent to that of 17 world citizens.  Baking rewards: Tezos implements a variation of PoS called liquid staking that lets participants bake, not stake, their XTZ for rewards. Baking is the process Tezos uses to add new blocks of transactions to its blockchain.  Forkless upgrades: Tezos can upgrade without the need for a fork, leaving developers and users uninterrupted. A fork occurs whenever there is a change to the current status quo of a specific blockchain.  Let’s dive into each of these bullets in more detail.  Energy efficiency  One way the Tezos blockchain is different is its reduced energy consumption and low carbon footprint. Using a PoS consensus algorithm means it is already using less energy than the computer-driven PoW on blockchains such as Bitcoin.  According to an independent report conducted by PwC, Tezos transactions consume approximately 2.5g of carbon dioxide (CO2) per transaction, while Ethereum currently consumes around 79.67kg of CO2 per transaction. Put differently, the Tezos network has approximately the same carbon footprint as 17 people, while Ethereum has a carbon footprint close to the entire country of Ireland. Tezos developers are continuing to bring the platform’s energy consumption down even lower and say the blockchain has already increased its transaction efficiency by over 70% since the platform launched, despite a growing ecosystem.  Many DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEX), dapps and other projects are working on the Tezos blockchain. Non-fungible tokens (NFT), in particular, have become increasingly popular on the Tezos platform thanks to its low carbon footprint. Existing platforms including Rarible have integrated Tezos NFTs, while new projects like the music NFT platform OneOf have built on Tezos.  Baking rewards  Tezos validates transactions through a process known as baking rather than staking. Staking is typically how PoS-based blockchains verify transactions on the network. Baking on Tezos reaches the same result by, among other ways, letting XTZ holders delegate their tokens to so-called bakers. Delegating XTZ to bakers enables on-chain governance and validation rewards without needing the minimum 8,000 tokens (known as 1 ""roll"") to do so.  Related: Cryptocurrencies You Can Stake: An In-Depth Guide  The delegation structure behind Tezo’s baking system is unique from traditional PoS consensus, but also from delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchains like EOS or Tron. Under traditional DPoS consensus, delegation is required for the blockchain to reach consensus. With Tezos, delegation is often the most convenient way to participate in the ecosystem, but it is not a requirement for consensus. This distinction has led the Tezos community to distinguish the platform’s consensus from DPoS by referring to it as liquid staking.  Forkless upgrades  In April, Tezos released its Tenderbake upgrade, which enabled faster transactions and decentralized applications. Three months later, Tezos announced the launch of Jakarta, the blockchain's 10th major protocol upgrade. The Tenderbake, Jakarta and other upgrades prior were able to be implemented without the need for a fork.  Forkless upgrades set Tezos apart from other blockchains because of its ability to self-upgrade and eliminate disruption for Tezos users. When major upgrades are required on other blockchains, like Ethereum, a hard fork is required for the features to be implemented. A hard fork essentially splits a blockchain into two different versions, making the older one invalid. Developers and node operators are required to transition over to the new fork or risk losing funds or being left behind. With Tezos, the transition to a new upgrade is seamless, allowing bakers and developers to continue working without disruption.  For an upgrade to happen on the Tezos blockchain, a proposal must first be presented to the community and voted on. If the proposal passes the on-chain governance, the upgrade will then be tested on a separate blockchain to ensure its success. Once the upgrade is considered to be stable on the testnet, the upgrade is then seamlessly switched over to the main Tezos blockchain.

All were the proceeds of illegal crypto trades, the Prosecutor General's office said. The assets, worth around $3.39 million combined, were handed over to Ukraine's Asset Recovery and Management Agency, which is similar to the U.S. Marshals Service.  Local police are investigating fraud, money laundering and tax evasion charges against unnamed persons, prosecutors said.

This token will be required for (i) governance, (ii) payment of transaction fees on StarkNet, and (iii) participation in StarkNet’s consensus mechanism,” according to the StarkWare Medium post.  The token will go on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token in September. The company has minted an initial 10 billion tokens, which will be allocated to core StarkNet contributors, including StarkWare, StarkWare investors and StarkNet developer partners.  Tokens will also go to the new StarkNet Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to maintaining the network as a public good.

The firm paid down $50 million to Compound early Wednesday and reclaimed 10,000 wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), a bitcoin-replica token retrofitted for the Ethereum blockchain. The wBTC stake is worth about $195 million at current prices.  Data on the blockchain transaction tracer Etherscan shows that a wallet linked to Celsius transferred 50 million DAI tokens – MakerDAO's dollar-pegged stablecoin – to Compound in two instances. After the down payments, Compound released 6,900, then 3,100 wBTC tokens to Celsius that had been locked up on the protocol as collateral.  After that, Celsius transferred 10,000 wBTC to the same unlabeled wallet address where the firm's 416,000 stETH stake – some $435 million at current prices – ended up the day before.  The maneuver followed a similar treasury-management tactic that Celsius used recently to fully pay off and close its loans from the DeFi lending protocols Aave and Maker. The loans on these protocols are overcollateralized, meaning the borrower has to lock up more digital assets in value than the loan's value.  Paying off overcollateralized loans is theoretically a net positive for Celsius's liquidity because the move unlocks more assets in value than what is needed to pay down the loans.  Celsius is among the crypto lenders crippled by the recent liquidity crisis among crypto firms. The Department of Financial Regulation in Vermont, a U.S. state, alleged the lender is ""deeply insolvent."" The firm suspended withdrawals, cut jobs and hired restructuring advisers.  However, Celsius has been making good on its debt to DeFi protocols. Since the start of July it has paid back $223 million to Maker, $235 million to Aave and $258 million to Compound.  As a result, it reclaimed more than a billion dollars worth of its crypto assets, mostly in wBTC and a type of ether (ETH) derivative token called stETH, which had been stuck on the protocols as collateral.  After paying down the Maker loan, blockchain data showed that the firm sent almost $500 million wBTC previously reclaimed as collateral to the crypto exchange FTX.

The board appointed Chief Technology Officer Paul Gosker and Chief Mining Officer Thomas Heller as interim co-presidents and CEOs while a search is conducted for permanent replacements.  ""Compass Mining was created to make mining easy and accessible,"" said the statement. ""The company recognizes that there have been multiple setbacks and disappointments that have detracted from that objective. Through this restructuring, the company is wholly focused on regaining the goodwill of the company’s stakeholders and the community, as well as delivering on the company’s mission of providing best-in-class service for miners of all sizes.""  Hosting firm Dynamics Mining took to Twitter last week to claim it terminated its contract with Compass Mining because the latter owed them over $600,000 in bills. Dynamics also accused Compass Mining employees of attempting to break into its facility in Maine to steal back the machines. CoinDesk has been unable to verify these claims and Compass Mining hasn't formally commented on the allegations.  On June 24, the firm closed its Discord channel with a day's notice, with some customers taking to Twitter to say the move was intended to hinder their ability to share information and complaints. CEO Gibbs (also a co-founder with Gosker) told CoinDesk at that time that the firm has had issues communicating with its clientele, and the Discord move was about improving the workflow of customer service.  ""Lots of things are very poorly managed and executed on, which gives people the perception that they’re shady,"" one former Compass Mining employee told CoinDesk. The employee didn't want to be identified for fear of litigation.  Over the past year, customers have complained about buildout delays in South Carolina, Nebraska and Ontario.

The ape-traited NFT is the 32nd-rarest punk in the 10,000 edition collection, according to data from analytics platform Rarity.Tools. The sale was the fifth largest in the collection’s history.  Based on CryptoPunk #4464’s estimated market value, the eye-popping sale was a fair deal for both the buyer and seller. NFT price estimator DeepNFTValue had the collectible valued at 2595 ETH (roughly $2.7 million) at the time of sale, just a 4% difference from its final price.  The buyer was pseudonymous NFT whale “zoomc,” whose collection now includes 24 CryptoPunks and 113 Meebits.  CryptoPunk summer  The sale wasn’t the only notable CryptoPunk moment on Tuesday. CryptoPunk #9280, another ape-traited edition, received a $2.6 million bid of its own two hours after CryptoPunk #4464’s bid was accepted. The bid for CryptoPunk #9280 had not been accepted as of press time, however.  The buzzy bids come amid a summer resurgence for the blue chip collection despite a downturn in the larger crypto markets. The collection’s floor price is now up to 77 ETH (roughly $90,000), a 61% increase in the last 30 days, with overall sales and interest picking up significantly since the start of June.  Some of that interest might be due to the project’s new brand lead, Noah Davis.

British computer scientist and CEO of legal services chatbot DoNotPay, Joshua Browder, suggests investors sue the lender as it faces insolvency. He told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” a loophole in Celsius’ terms of service (Section 27 C) gives individual investors the ability to file a claim suit against Celsius Network in small claims court. The claim, however, must fall below a $10,000 threshold, but that may work to the benefit of plaintiffs.  “It’s likely that small claims court judges will side with consumers,” Browder said in reference to an estimated 1,700 pending cases “across the country, in small towns” DoNotPay is working on. He predicts that Celsius will be too preoccupied to deal with individual cases of such small size.  “We believe Celsius isn’t actually going to show up to a lot of these cases … it’s often the case where corporations feel like it’s more expensive to actually hire a lawyer to defend themselves, than it is to get a default judgment against them,” Browder said.  The beleaguered company, he said, “has bigger problems at the moment” than worrying about “if a consumer sues for $5,000 in a rural Colorado town, in their local small claims court.”  DoNotPay, originally built in 2015 to contest parking tickets, has since expanded. Browder said that when the Celsius debacle first erupted, some users wrote in looking for help, saying they had lost their life savings.  “It’s helpful to get the smallest investors at the front of the line. To get paid back,” he said.  Browder said courts will be focused on any disclosures Celsius may have failed to make. “In our opinion, they didn’t disclose the risks,” he said. In addition, Browder added his company is looking into pending withdrawals that were made before Celsius ordered a freeze.  Meanwhile, as retail investors look to find ways to salvage their assets, Browder said that his team is also looking into other cases. It had begun looking at Voyager Digital, he added, but plans were scrapped after the broker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week.

The move will allow D’Aloia to serve legal documents to people who are not known but connected to two digital wallets. This is significant in the crypto sector, where scams and hacks can often only be tied to wallet addresses.  “This is so important because it shows the court's willingness to adapt to new technologies and embrace the blockchain and actually step in to help consumers where previous legislation and regulators simply could not do that,” Joanna Bailey, an associate lawyer from Giambrone & Partners LLP who worked on the case, told CoinDesk in an interview.  D’Aloia claimed to have been lured by an online brokerage into depositing about 2.1 million USDT and 230,000 USDC into two wallets that turned out to be fraudulent. The court ruling, said Bailey, allows D’Aloia to sue the people responsible for the fraudulent platform by sending the court documents through an NFT drop to the two wallets.  Binance, Poloniex, Gate.io, OKX and Bitkub have been identified by D’Aloia as holding his crypto. D’Aloia last month was granted an injunction forbidding the exchanges from moving those assets.

The skatepark will span 36 parcels of the game’s land, making it the “largest virtual skatepark ever made,” according to a press release.  The metaverse tie-up comes in partnership with Autograph, a non-fungible token (NFT) platform founded by National Football League star Tom Brady. Hawk released his first collection on the platform in December.  “I have been a fan of new technology all of my life, from the first video games and home computers with CGI capabilities,” Hawk said in a video announcing the news. “So I am fascinated by the metaverse, and excited to bring our culture into the virtual landscape of The Sandbox.”  The avatar NFTs released by Hawk will commemorate the outfit he wore during the 1999 X Games, when he landed the first ever 900, a milestone moment in the world of skateboarding.  While the partnership is Hawk’s first in the blockchain gaming space, the entrepreneurial skater has more than made a name for himself in the traditional gaming industry. His “Tony Hawk Pro Skater” series has grossed more than $1.4 billion since its debut in 1999, making it one of the most profitable video game franchises of all time.

42374263,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYqaB,1657720800,US Tribal Nation-Backed Economic Zone Passes Rules Defining Digital Assets,"A digital economic zone backed by the Catawba Indian Nation in Rock Hill, S.C., has passed a set of regulations aimed at creating ""legal clarity"" for digital assets.  The framework defines digital assets – from cryptocurrencies to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – as intangible property or personal property without a physical existence, according to a Wednesday announcement.  The Catawba Digital Economic Zone (CDEZ), which was set up in February, is a sovereign regulatory zone established and backed by the Catawba Nation, the announcement said. The new regulations were adopted on July 6 by the the tribal nation's Zone Authority Commission. The economic zone plans to allow digital asset companies to remotely incorporate under its laws.  “[The rules] are in effect now, but we have only just begun to market the zone to prospective companies. This policy will be the foundation for a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto and Web3 companies,” Joseph McKinney, CEO and founder of CDEZ said in an email to CoinDesk.  The Catawba Indian Nation is a 700-acre reservation with just over 3,000 citizens and is the only federally recognized native tribe in South Carolina. The Catawba government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the CDEZ legislation.  The zone authority has separate assets, liabilities and independent decision-making capacity from the Catawba government, but it is ultimately accountable to the nation’s elected leadership and legislative arms, McKinney said.  “The zone is run by a for-profit management company that is majority owned by the Catawba Indian Nation,” the statement said, adding, “Many of the blockchain-related regulations, such as the digital assets regulation, were based on the years of work of the Wyoming policymakers, though we improved it when there was a clear need.”  The new regulatory framework, reviewed by CoinDesk, says a digital asset could be a “digital consumer asset” bought primarily for consumptive purposes. A “virtual currency” can be used as a unit of account, means of exchange or a store of value that isn't legal tender in the U.S. A “digital security” cannot be either a virtual currency or digital consumer asset.  It also defines NFTs as indivisible assets that may be classified as securities depending on the nature of their use. Fractionalized NFTs that split up the ownership of one NFT between multiple people could fall outside of the scope of the framework.  “NFTs, by their very nature as non-fungible assets, are indivisible and unique. That does not prohibit firms from denoting economic interest in the NFT with fungible tokens. However, the definition of those fungible tokens will be defined differently from the Code itself,” McKinney said.  According to the announcement, establishing legal definitions of digital assets is the first step toward setting up more sophisticated regulatory frameworks governing the likes of the asset-backed stablecoins and member-owned decentralized autonomous organizations that underpin decentralized finance.  “Now that we have clear digital asset definitions established, a milestone that many governments have still failed to achieve, we can move forward. The zone can quickly pass thorough and comprehensive frameworks for the regulation of DAOs, stablecoins and other facets of the Web3 space that are currently poorly defined in legal codes around the world,” Sam Trimnal, chairman of the Zone Authority Commission, said in a press statement.  In early June, the CDEZ launched a public comment period for the development of regulations for DAOs.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/13/us-tribal-nation-backed-economic-zone-passes-rules-defining-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2a97cfc343ad9c99a319d8c09bb3c2daa0867db-2177x1633.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374293,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYv6j,1657720340,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Drops After CPI Data Comes In Hotter Than Expected,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: BTC dips 4.2%, DeFi token Aave is up 7% and more investigations are issued into troubled crypto lenders.  Market Moves: Omkar Godbole looks at a report from Coinbase (COIN) that found long-term bitcoin investors preserved their holdings in recent weeks even as speculators fled the market.  JUST IN: The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) in June increased 9.1% from 12 months earlier, the Labor Department reported Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The jump, a new four-decade high, exceeded economists’ average estimate for an 8.8% increase. The price surge was “broad-based,” according to the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, with notable contributions from gasoline, shelter, food, used cars and trucks, medical care, motor vehicle insurance, new vehicles, apparel, household furnishings and recreation.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) dipped in the minutes after U.S. CPI data came in hotter than expected, increasing to 9.1% in June from 8.8% in May.  Bitcoin’s price fell 4.2% to about $19,200 in the minutes since the report was released. Speculation might be that the Federal Reserve will have to keep tightening monetary conditions aggressively to tamp down inflation.  Ether (ETH), was up 1.4% on the day, at around $1,070.  Taking the lead among altcoins was AAVE, the token of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, Aave , which climbed 7% in the last 24 hours. The increase comes as the troubled crypto lender, Celsius Network, paid off its debt on Aave, freeing up $26 million in tokens as part of its latest debt restructuring maneuver.  The price of AAVE was around $72 at the time of writing.  Vermont’s Department of Financial Regulation (DFR) said in a statement on Tuesday that Celsius Network “is deeply insolvent,” noting that the lender lacks the assets and liquidity to honor its obligations to account holders and other creditors.  The DFR has joined a multistate investigation of the lender, according to the statement.  Meanwhile, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) is investigating several U.S.-based crypto lenders after a series of prominent lenders indefinitely halted withdrawals and transfers between user accounts, according to a press release issued on Tuesday.  In other news, BlockFi reversed its plan to stop accepting Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as collateral for loans. A few hours after the lender said it would no longer accept shares of the trust as collateral, it said in a statement, ""We are not saying that we won't support GBTC as collateral moving forward."" (Grayscale Investments, which administers GBTC, is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Crypto venture capital giant Multicoin Capital announced Tuesday a $430 million fund for crypto early-stage projects. The fund will invest $500,000-$1 million in early stage and up to $100 million for more mature opportunities.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −9.9% Smart Contract Platform Loopring LRC −8.9% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC −7.5% Smart Contract Platform  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Long-Term Bitcoin Investors Stick It Out as Speculator Selling Drives Prices Lower: Coinbase  Long-term bitcoin investors preserved their holdings in recent weeks even as speculators fled the market, driving the cryptocurrency below $20,000, according to crypto exchange Coinbase.  ""Recent BTC selling has been carried out almost exclusively by short-term speculators,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, said in the monthly outlook published Tuesday.  The persistent holding by investors is perhaps a sign of confidence that the cryptocurrency would survive in what appears to be a U.S. Federal Reserve-induced bear market and eventually thrive as a fiat alternative or digital gold.  Duong called bitcoin ownership retention by investors a positive sentiment indicator, ensuring demand-supply balance in the face of speculator selling, which is a common feature of a bear market.  On-chain data tracked by Coinbase Analytics shows investors now hold about 77% of the total bitcoin supply of 21 million. While the number is off slightly from the early January high of 80%, it is still well above the peak of 60% observed during the height of the late 2017 bull run. The data show a significant amount of wealth has been distributed from speculators or traders to investor in 3.5 years.  The report titled ""The Elusive Bottom"" defines long-term investors as wallets holding the cryptocurrency for at least six months.  Speculators aretypicallysophisticated participants or retail traders who purchase assets for short periods and employ strategies to profit from short-term price gyrations. Speculators and traders are more sensitive to macroeconomic factors like changes in the Fed policy.

Crypto exchange Binance confirmed the burn in a post. Burning is a term used in crypto circles to describe taking a certain amount of tokens out of circulation. Such moves make tokens like BNB more valuable for holders as supply is decreased.  BNB powers the BNB Chain ecosystem and is the native coin of the BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain. It was issued by crypto exchange Binance after an initial coin offering in 2017.  BNB uses an auto-burn system to reduce its total supply to 100 million BNB. The auto-burn mechanism adjusts the amount of BNB to be burned based on BNB's price and the number of blocks generated on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) during the quarter.

42374274,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYumb,1657716676,US Inflation Gauge Jumps to Fresh 4-Decade High of 9.1%; Bitcoin Falls,"Inflation tracked by the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 9.1% in June, accelerating from May's 8.6% pace to a fresh 40-year high, exceeding economist expectation.  Bitcoin's price fell 4.2% to about $19,200 in the minutes after the report was released. The Federal Reserve may now have to keep tightening monetary conditions aggressively to tamp down inflation.  Cryptocurrencies across the board had been trading higher Wednesday in the hours leading up to the CPI release, with bitcoin (BTC) trading at $19,786 in the early hours.  The cryptocurrency, which is supposed to serve as an inflation hedge for some traders, is down nearly 70% since inflation started accelerating in October 2021.  The June price data might end up representing a peak in the inflation rate, given that oil and gasoline prices have declined.  “There are certainly positive signs that would indicate the worst is behind us,” said Jonathan Silver, founder and CEO of Affinity Solutions, a global insights firm tracking consumer purchasing habits.  “The job market remains strong, which is putting money in people’s pockets; however, price increases are still outpacing people's paychecks. Hopefully this trend will reverse itself as inflation reaches its peak and begins to dissipate. Our purchase spending data suggests that this is the direction we are headed,” he said.  Federal Reserve implications  The Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, is scheduled to meet July 26-27 to discuss further monetary tightening. The fresh inflation high could give central bankers the green light for another aggressive rate hike. The Fed has prioritized the battle to stabilize prices over any push for economic growth at this point in time.  “Is there a risk we would go too far? Certainly there’s a risk,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a recent conference at a European Central Bank forum. “The bigger mistake to make – let’s put it that way – would be to fail to restore price stability.”  According to one widely used definition, two consecutive quarters of slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP) would mean that the U.S. is in a recession, but Powell and other central bankers point to the strong labor force, which shows signs the economy is still very strong.  ​​“Spending over the coming months will be contingent on a variety of key factors including a potential [COVID-19] resurgence, the war in the Ukraine, if supply chain pressure eases, as well as the effect of rate hikes on consumer spending,” Silver said. “It will be interesting to see what happens after the summer hangover recedes and we get a clearer picture of the state of the economy, the war in Ukraine and COVID.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/13/us-inflation-gauge-jumps-to-fresh-4-decade-high-of-91-bitcoin-falls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d74cd302118a3dbb4273980622d850bc6d49003c-1765x1324.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CESS, Cumulus Encrypted Storage System, is a third-generation decentralized, cloud-based data storage protocol built for Web 3.0. Despite the rapid ascent of Web3 technologies to the forefront of discussions on how the world should connect, share, and do business, many people have misconceptions about the growth trajectory of this bleeding-edge technology, the business opportunities for leveraging Web3, and the role of Web3 in the wider tech space.

Moderated by Masa Kakiya of Consensys, the panel included industry leaders from Bware Labs, Nakji Network, and Google, and also featured Nicholas Zaldastani, the Chairman of CESS.

42413284,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Huy,1657713600,Mila Kunis-Linked Web3 Studio Toonstar Partners With Hot Topic to Market Entertainment NFTs,"Toonstar, the Web3 animation studio that co-produces The Gimmicks with Mila Kunis’s company Sixth Wall is hoping to take Web3 mainstream through entertainment non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Toonstar announced Wednesday it will partner with retail chain Hot Topic to provide NFTs and Web3 experiences for its original projects and Hot Topic products, according to a press release.  Toonstar sees the intersection of NFTs and retail as an opportunity to take the Web3 space mainstream, according to CEO and co-founder John Attanasio. With Hot Topics’s 800 stores across the U.S. and 11 million existing members of The Hot Topic HT Fanatics community, the company can onboard new users to the space.  Attanasio told CoinDesk that at the intersection of the entertainment and retail spaces is “transmedia”: a term he defined as fostering connections on screen and through merchandise. He cited Disney (DIS) as “the gold standard,” with Mickey Mouse as its flagship character (and subsequent product).  Attanasio said NFTs might be the new backbone for transmedia. Alongside Hot Topic’s existing community, this can further bring Web3 adoption mainstream.  Toonstar will support Hot Topic in initiating in-store NFT sales, facilitating physical NFT merch redemption, and help to bring customers’ favorite brands carried in-store to Web3.  Additionally, Toonstar, which co-produces Web3 show ""The Gimmicks"" with Mila Kunis’s company Sixth Wall, will offer exclusive NFTs and show merchandise through the store. With the official launch of the partnership on July 21 at San Diego Comic-Con, Hot Topic community members will get the chance to have a cameo feature in an episode of the show.  Attanasio said the partnership’s thesis is “around the idea that entertainment is the thing that will take Web3 mainstream,” and ""The Gimmicks"" was “built with that in mind.”  Although Toonstar’s partnership is exclusive to Hot Topic, Attanasio says that future partnerships are “on the horizon,” potentially with a streaming service to perpetuate the intersection of entertainment and Web3.

In turn, cryptocurrency enables individuals to easily support the causes that they believe in, even when reaching affected groups through traditional means may be difficult.

42393815,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBMdZ,1657711800,What’s in Your Bear Market Backpack?,"As crypto markets plunged deep into bear market territory last month, discourse in some corners of the Ethereum ecosystem began to veer into the existential. Rather than searching for sky-high lending yields and the next non-fungible token (NFT) collection to rival Bored Apes, many among crypto’s Twitteratti – half-jokingly, half-seriously – set their sights on bigger questions: “What’s it all even mean?”  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.     And then there was Vitalik. On June 20, two days after ether crashed to its lowest price in over a year, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder and thought-leader-in-chief, penned an essay on his closely watched blog: “My 40-liter backpack travel guide.”  Never lacking insight, Buterin wrote a post containing dozens of useful morsels for traveling light and on a budget. He provided links to a flash-drive-sized portable shaver, recommended two different compact laptop stands (the lighter one was only “medium-effective”) and included pictures of his favorite Shiba-emblazoned sweatpants and Uniswap-themed socks. He also extolled the virtues of “Uniqlo maximalism” in a section dedicated entirely to the Japanese retail brand.  The two posts preceding Buterin’s travel guide were titled “Some ways to use ZK-SNARKs for privacy” and “Where to use a blockchain in non-financial applications?” In a tech-focused blog that tends to read more like academic literature than wikiHow, Buterin’s take on life as a digital nomad stuck out.  Its oddness was especially apparent given its timing. When Buterin published his hitchhiker's guide to backpacking, markets were tanking and commentators were calling the entire Ethereum experiment into question.  And yet, Buterin seemed not to be thinking of current events when he suggested that toilet paper rolls can make the perfect portable microphone stand.  Buterin’s public persona – or at least the one he projects out to the broader crypto community – is that of a builder. By Buterin’s logic, prices and Ponzis are merely a sideshow in a world where Ethereum's core technology – consensus mechanisms, zero-knowledge proofs, sharding, etc. – continues to progress.  Zaki Manian, a leading figure in the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem who has known Buterin for nearly a decade, tried to explain this builder mentality in an interview with CoinDesk.  “There's this tiny world that existed in like 2014 to 2015 of people where it was a bear market, no one cared, and there was no money. We all just hung out. It was super fun. Honestly, you can see from his tweeting that Vitalik, just the minute the bear market starts again, he's happier,” Manian said.  “We have this weird joy that we get from the bear markets where it's like, oh, OK, we can just, like, go back to being ourselves.”  Bull or bear, Buterin’s view – at least publicly – is that of an unfazed veteran.  Bear market utility for ENS  Of course, Buterin’s “all-is-well” posture does not exist in a vacuum. So how is everyone else responding?  As the contagion from the Terra stablecoin ecosystem collapse and the Celsius and 3AC insolvencies continue to wreak havoc across crypto balance sheets, blockchain companies large and small are bracing for crypto winter by laying off workers and cutting down expenses.  Investment activity overall has gone mum relative to the 2020 to 2021 bull market frenzy. And yet, even the more money-minded among us are finding new ways to stay engaged in Ethereum (and crypto) amid the turmoil.  This past month saw a major spike in investment around the Ethereum Name Service – the decentralized domain name protocol built specifically for the Ethereum blockchain. Increased ENS activity suggests that some crypto investors have found solace not by avoiding the ecosystem altogether, but by investing in elements of it that they expect to hold utility beyond just speculation.  ENS provides users with an easily readable name attached to their Ethereum-based crypto wallets instead of a long, complex address made up of numbers and letters. Many have compared ENS to the Domain Name System for web2 (like “apple.com”), while others have approached the purchase of .eth names as an investment, looking to trade or sell popular names.  And with low gas prices, users have seen it as the optimal time to invest in ENS domain names. Over the past week, ENS registrations have spiked nearly 200%, according to Dune Analytics user @makoto, with 30,000 new addresses added on July 4 alone, and 20,000 on July 7.  On the secondary market, in particular on OpenSea, trade in ENS names has also seen large activity. This is not the first time that ENS domain names have spiked. In April 2022, OpenSea saw a spike in its three-letter and four-letter domain names.  But the recent ENS hype comes as the address “000.eth” was bought for a record-breaking 300 ETH.  So why the current spike? Even though gas fees are at a two-year low, users and companies may be picking up .eth names – rather than CryptoPunks, Bored Apes or other non-fungible tokens (NFT) – because of their added utility.  Anderson Mccutcheon, the CEO of Chains, confirmed this view last week via a telegram message to CoinDesk reporter Shaurya Malwa, noting that the interest in ENS is “partly driven by the fact that it's one of the very few pure true utility NFTs that are visible, widely known, liquid and traded on OpenSea.”  The utility of ENS is in serving as a sort of extended domain name – making it easy for users to transact without the need to share complicated (and easy to screw up) lines of numbers and letters. ENS is also a bet on a future of decentralized identity, whereby users can log into apps and services via their crypto wallet at the click of a button.  This wallet-centric vision becomes all the more appealing when a wallet can be associated with an identity – like a screen name – rather than a string of random characters assigned by the Ethereum hivemind.  Of course, ENS also has a speculative component; there is only a set number of domain names that are unique, and over time one might hope that cutesy names like “cat.eth” or “dog.eth” get swept up by brands or collectors.  Could there be an element of FOMO? Absolutely. But clearly, users seem to think ENS domains have some kind of added value compared to the purely speculative side of the NFT market.  The recent ENS craze could be a meaningless blip, but it could also be a sign of what’s to come.  As the bear market drags on and Buterin and his contingent of developers continue to build the core technology underlying Ethereum, utility-minded plays like ENS – rather than purely speculative NFTs or decentralized finance (DeFi) money games – seem likelier to gain retail traction. How long utility will trump pure speculation, however, remains anyone’s guess.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week.

However, the breakout rally struggles to surpass the 100-day SMA resulting in an evening star pattern accounting for a drop of 12% within two days. Nonetheless, the buyers quickly avoid losses below the $5.50 level leading to a Doji candle formation. Source- Tradingview UNI Technical Analysis The UNI prices retest the bearish breakout of the 5.90 horizontal level and show higher price rejection in the Doji candle. Furthermore, the increase in the intraday trading volume during the evening star formation displays a phenomenal rise in selling pressure. Hence the likelihood of a bullish continuation diminishes. The market price trades between the 50 and 100-day SMA, but the increase in selling pressure teases a bearish breakout of the 50-day SMA. The MACD indicator shows the fast and slow lines struggling to sustain an uptrend in the positive territory, evidenced by the decrease in bullish spread.

42374295,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYv2x,1657709872,US CPI Preview: Inflation Likely to Climb to New 40-Year High,"U.S. consumer prices probably rose 1.1% in June, pushing the year-on-year change to a four-decade high of 8.8%, FXStreet data shows. A reading above that could bring renewed selling pressure to risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC).  The U.S. Labor Department will release the widely tracked consumer price index (CPI) measuring the cost of living in the world's largest economy on Wednesday at 12:30 UTC. Core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is expected to be 0.6% month-on-month, or 5.8% for the year.  The White House was in a damage control mode early Monday, calling the forecast bump in inflation a backward-looking and out-of-date figure skewed higher by energy and food prices, which have retreated over the last couple of weeks.  A higher-than-expected inflation print, particularly for core CPI, would validate the Federal Reserve's strategy of combating price pressures with aggressive rate hikes and balance sheet runoff, bolstering the dollar rally and bringing renewed selling pressure to risk assets, bitcoin among them.  Fed fund futures show expectations for a 75 basis points rate increase later this month are fully priced in. Traders have also baked in a 50 basis point hike in September and 25 basis points raises in November and December. The central bank has raised rates by 150 basis points to the 1.5%-1.75% range since March.  A hotter-than-expected figure may also see traders scale back expectations for Fed rate cuts next year. At press time, rates traders are pricing in an easing of monetary policy in the second half of 2023 to reverse the tightening cycle's negative impact on economic activity.  On the flip side, bitcoin and other risk assets will probably rally if core inflation eases, reviving the ""inflation has peaked"" narrative and strengthening the case for the Fed to slow policy tightening in the coming months.  Here is how some observers expect the CPI to influence bitcoin.  Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Singapore-based Stack Funds, told CoinDesk:  ""We believe it is largely priced in, but any deviation from the forecast will bring huge volatility. Bitcoin has been trading heavily 'risk off' since Sunday in anticipation of macro news this week and is approaching recent support.  ""If a print comes in higher than 8.8%, it's likely BTC will be approaching the $18,000 handle in the short term.""  John Kicklighter, chief strategist at DailyFX, said:  ""Wednesday's CPI is a capable catalyst to put the markets back on the move, but it is a higher bar to generate broader traction in 'risk trends' that will pull bitcoin and crypto further down along with other traditional speculative assets. On the other hand, another extension for the dollar, which is trading between 20 and 35-year highs against its largest counterparts (euro, yen and pound), could certainly throttle this principal alternative-to-fiat.""  Vetle Lunde, an analyst at Arcane Research, noted in the weekly report:  ""Be prepared for volatility following Wednesday's CPI print at 08:30 E.T. Inflation surprises towards the upside lead to enhanced expectations of further tightening of monetary policies by the Federal Reserve.  ""These contractionary policies have a broad impact on equities, and this macro backdrop has been an important factor in bitcoin's bear market since November 2021.""  The monthly U.S. inflation reports have persistently injected volatility into the bitcoin market this year, with above-forecast figures leading to price declines.  Michael Boutros, a strategist at DailyFX, said:  ""It’s either a bear-flag or an wedge/consolidation formation [on bitcoin's daily chart] around the monthly open. Either way it does look similar to the May – June [pre-CPI] setup.  ""A quick study on the May/June price pattern suggests another few days of consolidation before another potential decisive break lower. A break below 17,792 is needed to fuel the next leg lower towards the 2019 high at 13,880 and the 100% extension of the entire sell-off at 12,079 – an area of interest for possible support IF reached. Ultimately bitcoin would need to breach/close above 25,850 to invalidate this current downtrend.""  Simons Chen, a private equity fund manager, said:  ""If the June CPI data shows inflation has continued to expand, and exceeds market expectations, the Fed is bound to raise interest rates hard and fast in the second half of the year, right through to year-end.  ""In December, we expect the interest rate will quickly reach 350 basis points or higher (3.5%+), and it will likely remain in the 350~400 basis points range or higher throughout 2023 to curb high inflation. At present, commodities and stock markets have already pulled back from their recent peaks by around 30%~50%+, based on expectations of rising interest rates.  ""Meanwhile producer price index has eased. But the short-term decline is not sufficient to reduce the long-term inflation rate, unless we see raw materials return to lower levels.""

42374272,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYuk5,1657709646,Kazakh Crypto Mining Tax Hike Signed Into Law by President Tokayev,"Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Monday signed into law amendments to the tax code to increase levies on crypto miners, a move he had called for in early February to counter the nation's struggle with electricity shortages.  In February, Tokayev said that the rate of 1 Kazakh tenge (US$0.0021) per kilowatt of power is ""negligible"" and instructed the government to increase the tax as soon as possible and to come up with a full proposal for crypto mining regulation by April 1. The 1 tenge tax came into effect on Jan. 1.  The new tax rate will be determined by the average price of the electricity consumed to mine coins during a certain tax period, according to a copy of the amendments published on hosting site Zakon.kz. The range is between 1 tenge per kilowatt hour (kWh), if a miner is paying more than 24 tenge per kWh for electricity, to a tax of 25 tenge per kWh, if a miner is paying less than 1 tenge per kWh, according to the amendments.  The law effectively brings the price of electricity including tax to around 25 tenge, or 5 cents, per kWh with some exceptions. That is about the maximum price that miners are looking for in other countries such as the U.S. and Canada.  Miners that use their own electricity, an example of behind-the-meter consumption, will pay 10 tenge per kWh in taxes, whereas those who use renewable energy that they produce will pay 1 tenge per kWh, according to the amendments.  The amendments will go into effect on Jan. 1.  Crypto miners flocked to Kazakhstan after China cracked down on the industry last year. The central Asian country once had an electricity surplus, but since the influx of crypto miners, the national grid has been struggling to meet demand. The government shut off power to crypto mines in January.  CoinDesk has earlier reported that Kazakhstan has been trying to root out mining operations that don't have proper licensing to reduce the load on the country's energy grid. In March, Kazakhstan announced the closure of 106 mines, seizing 67,000 machines worth $193 million. In May, the government required crypto miners to register their operations with authorities.  At the same time, Kazakhstan has been trying to bring crypto exchanges to Kazakhstan Nur-Sultan, previously called Astana and the capital city of Kazakhstan. The nation aims to test a pilot project for the creation and operation of cryptocurrency exchanges in the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), which was founded in 2018 with the goal of becoming a Central Asian financial hub.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,"Eliza Gkritsi, Amitoj Singh",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/13/kazakh-crypto-mining-tax-hike-signed-into-law-by-president-tokayev,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42374283,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYust,1657707248,International Standard Setters Publish Guidance on Stablecoin Regulations,"The Bank for International Settlements’ Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published their final guidance on regulating stablecoins Wednesday.  The guidance is a step toward implementing a “same risk, same regulation” legal framework for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies whose value is usually pegged to a national currency.  The CPMI is the BIS forum for international payments and settlements. IOSCO is an organization of the world’s securities regulators.  If a stablecoin performs a transfer function and regulators think it important to financial systems, it should observe the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) just as a different instrument performing that function would have to, the BIS said in a statement. The principles are the international standards for financial market infrastructures. Countries would decide for themselves whether they want to put them in place, it said.  The collapse of Terra’s stablecoin UST in May stirred regulators across the world to call for further regulation. CPMI Chairman Jon Cunliffe, who is also a deputy governor of the Bank of England, encouraged regulation of the sector in a speech earlier this week.  Meanwhile, the European Systemic Risk Board, which oversees the European Union’s financial system, also said it plans to make proposals on how global standards can be set for crypto assets that could pose a threat to the financial system.  “Recent developments in the crypto asset market have again brought urgency for authorities to address the potential risks posed by crypto assets, including stablecoins more broadly,” Cunliffe said in a report.  This final guidance follows the consultation the two bodies started last October.  The CPMI and IOSCO will continue to examine stablecoin regulation and coordinate with other standard-setting bodies, they said.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/13/international-standard-setters-publish-guidance-on-stablecoin-regulations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ddba4d733e7a875b1bc3e71b6a132c3b998df6b-1217x913.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Recent BTC selling has been carried out almost exclusively by short-term speculators,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, said in the monthly outlook published Tuesday.  The holding by long-term investors is perhaps a sign of confidence that the cryptocurrency will survive in what appears to be a Federal Reserve-induced bear market and eventually thrive as a fiat alternative or digital gold.  Duong called investors keeping their bitcoin a positive sentiment indicator that ensures the balance between demand and supply in the face of speculator selling, which is a common feature of a bear market.  On-chain data tracked by Coinbase Analytics shows investors now hold about 77% of the total bitcoin supply of 21 million. Although the number is off slightly from the early January high of 80%, it is still well above the peak of 60% observed during the height of the late 2017 bull run. The data shows a significant amount of wealth has been distributed from speculators or traders to investors during the past three and a half years.  The report titled ""The Elusive Bottom"" defines long-term investors as wallets holding the cryptocurrency for at least six months.  Speculators aretypicallysophisticated participants or retail traders who purchase assets for short periods of time and employ strategies to profit from short-term price gyrations. Speculators and traders are more sensitive to macroeconomic factors such as changes in the Fed's policy.  Bitcoin has fallen by more than 50% to $20,000 this year, primarily because of the Fed's decision to withdraw liquidity to combat high inflation.  The liquidity exodus has exposed faulty risk management practices in the crypto universe, forcing many trading firms and miners – those responsible for minting coins – to offload their holdings to stay solvent. Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that had billions of dollars in assets under management earlier this year, recently went insolvent. The fund's bankruptcy has hit several prominent crypto firms, including lending platforms Voyager Digital and Celsius Network.  ""Solvency concerns have forced an accumulation of realized losses, exposing vulnerabilities in other parts of the crypto ecosystem,"" Duong noted.

Voyager Digital has revealed in public filings that 3AC was unable to meet payments on a loan of 15,250 BTC, worth about $305 million, and $350 million of USD Coin. In the coming months, expect digital asset prices to remain subdued. By Benjamin Dean A process of deleveraging is underway in the digital asset industry. The events of recent months serve as a useful demonstration of how digital assets (or “crypto”) are merging with traditional finance—for better or for worse. The liquidation of Three Arrows Capital (3AC), 1 alongside the increasingly apparent exposures of its lending counterparties, have thrown a spotlight on the relatively new crypto lending industry. At the same time, these events have demonstrated the strengths of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which are still running smoothly, and provide transparency and auditability as all transactions on 'defi' platforms are conducted via open source software code and stored on distributed databases that can be checked 24/7. DeFi vs. CeFi To start with, it is important to establish what DeFi is. The following is a succinct definition: “Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers financial instruments without relying on financial intermediaries as brokerages, exchanges or banks by using smart contracts on a blockchain.” 2 According to the WisdomTree Digital Asset Taxonomy, 3 the DeFi segment of the digital asset ecosystem is less than 1% of the overall ecosystem’s market capitalization. 4 The segment comprises a set of decentralized applications (dApps) that operate on smart contract networks (e.g., Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Polygon ( MATIC-USD )). These dApps provide financial instruments or services such as trading, lending or derivatives. Examples include Aave ( AAVE-USD ), Compound ( COMP-USD ) and SushiSwap ( SUSHI-USD ). The key part of the DeFi definition lies at the end. The implication of using smart contracts on a blockchain is that one can audit the holdings at any point, owing to the transparent nature of distributed ledgers (blockchains) and open source smart contract code. The rules of the contract are very clear. Those who use DeFi apps do so with their public/private key pair 5 , which means that they self-custody their assets and decide when and how those assets are used. DeFi stands in contrast to what some term centralized finance (CeFi). Historically these two domains were separate in the sense that digital asset networks, like the Bitcoin network, were created outside of the traditional financial system (indeed – Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was created at least in part as a response to loose monetary policy over prior decades). In recent years, however, the lines have been blurring. The emergence of the centralized crypto lending industry is one such example. The industry can be broadly divided into crypto lending companies (e.g., BlockFi, Celsius ( CEL-USD ), Babel Finance), intermediaries connecting the lenders with borrowers (e.g., Genesis) and the borrowers themselves. These borrowers were often hedge funds who in some cases took leveraged positions on various digital assets. 3AC is one such hedge fund. If not taking leveraged long positions on digital assets, borrowers could also invest their holdings in DeFi apps so as to take advantage of the sometimes high yields offered. 6 Much of this lending activity involved U.S. dollar pegged tokens (stablecoins), which is another example of the blurring of the crypto and traditional financial rails. With these concepts in mind, it is possible to better understand what is currently transpiring. Let the deleveraging begin To understand present events, it helps to start with the collapse of Terraform Lab’s TerraUST ( UST-USD ) and the associated LUNA ( LUNA-USD ) cryptocurrency. At the beginning of April 2022, the LUNA cryptocurrency was valued at the equivalent of around $41 billion. By mid-May it was worth less than $300 million. 7 The peak amount of outstanding UST was over $18 billion on May 7, 2022. By July 1, 2022, one UST was trading at ¢4 on the dollar. 8 Think of the collapse of UST/LUNA as a depth charge. Now those who were exposed to the explosion are floating to the water’s surface. The first to show public signs of shakiness was crypto lender Celsius, when it suspended withdrawals citing, “extreme market conditions.” 9 The next was crypto lender BlockFi, which began to cut headcount 10 before revealing it was one of a number of companies involved in the liquidation of positions belonging to hedge fund 3AC. 11 It is at this point that the interconnectedness of the various crypto lenders with 3AC (and one another) becomes apparent. So far it is thought that 3AC had over $200 million in exposure to LUNA 12 —and that is the start. Crypto broker Voyager Digital ( VYGVF ) has revealed in public filings that 3AC was unable to meet payments on a loan of 15,250 BTC, worth about $305 million, and $350 million of USD Coin ( USDC-USD ). 13 Market maker and lender Genesis is thought to have hundreds of millions of dollars of exposure to 3AC. 14 At this time, a number of takeover and bailout efforts have been initiated but not concluded. Crypto exchange FTX is one of the main parties. 15 Crypto investment firm Morgan Creek Digital is another. 16 Time will tell how this will play out. If this story sounds familiar, it is because you are thinking about Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)—minus the Nobel Prize winning economists (or government bailout). The outcome of taking large, leveraged, long positions in markets that are as volatile as digital assets is hardly surprising. It is worth noting that the lack of transparency around the leveraged positions of hedge funds, like 3AC, and the level of collateralization of the positions of lenders such as BlockFi or Celsius, stand in contrast to the transparency and auditability that, as we noted above, are characteristics of DeFi. In the coming months, expect digital asset prices to remain subdued. The forced liquidation of digital asset positions puts additional supply into markets that have been characterized by a risk-off sentiment since January 2022. Even networks or dApps that have nothing to do with the liquidated positions and insolvencies, and continue to operate smoothly, are likely to end up collateral damage. Also expect more insolvent parties to emerge, particularly as trading volume dries up on small crypto exchanges. The path to responsible DeFi The good news is that the liquidation and bankruptcy of these entities has not yet had material impacts via contagion on the traditional financial system. 17 However, as lines between the crypto and traditional finance systems continue to blur, it is hard to imagine regulators not taking an even closer look at activities in and around the digital asset ecosystem. What is likely to emerge will be a more ‘responsible DeFi,’ spurred on by a more stringent set of regulatory requirements and oversight in industrialized economies. This trend was already apparent with the Executive Order on Ensuring the Responsible Development of Digital Assets 18 in the U.S. and with the soon-to-be-passed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) 19 in the EU. It will continue to gain pace in the near future. 20 1 Three Arrows Capital Ordered Into Liquidation by BVI Court: Report 2 Decentralized finance - Wikipedia 3 For a copy of ‘A New Asset Class: Investing in the Digital Asset Ecosystem’ please contact digitalassets@wisdomtree.com 4 Top DeFi Coins by Market Cap | CoinGecko 5 Public key cryptography underpins digital signatures.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin fell for a fifth day in a row, while the dollar and euro continued to flirt with parity. Traders are looking for clues about inflation in a major economic release expected Wednesday in the U.S.  Insights: Valuing NFTs might be more art than science. What's impossible to deny is that prices for ether (ETH) – used to value many NFTs – have tanked this year. Sam Reynolds explains.  Sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $19,361 −2.7%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,043 −4.4%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,818.80 −0.9%      ●Gold: $1,724 per troy ounce −0.4%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.96% −0.03       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin (BTC) fell for a fifth straight day, and traders are starting to worry that maybe the market hasn't reached a bottom, as some analysts were hoping as recently as last week.  It might just be that there are still too many negative forces pushing prices lower. The crypto term of choice is ""FUD"" – fear, uncertainty and doubt – but Michael Venuto, a co-founder of Toroso Investments, used the term ""wall of worry"" on CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" TV program on Tuesday.  The bugbears range from the crypto industry's credit crisis – CoinDesk's Krisztian Sandor has been all over liquidity-strapped Celsius Network's maneuvers to free up collateral by paying off decentralized finance loans – to the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting plans. (Helene Braun's preview of Wednesday's scheduled release of the U.S. consumer price index for June is here.)  ""We're just climbing a wall of worry,"" Venuto said. ""We lack regulation, for clarity, to help get the institutional money in, we are dealing with; a Fed that is no longer accommodative. We've got deleveraging of all things. And then we've got a whole bunch of trusted third parties that came in to help people access to crypto markets, and as usual, they shouldn't have been trusted.""  In traditional markets, U.S. stocks slid, and Asian equity futures signaled modest gains at Wednesday's open.  The big story in foreign-exchange markets this week continued to be the dollar's flirtation with euro ""parity"" – a 1-to-1 ratio. According to CNBC, the euro's slide against the dollar is a result of Europe's energy-supply crisis stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions on Russia. There are also concerns that a weak economy might make it harder for the European Central Bank to raise interest rates – making the region's debt instruments less attractive than those in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve has been raising rates aggressively.  Markets  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Chainlink LINK +0.8% Computing Gala GALA +0.4% Entertainment  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −9.6% Smart Contract Platform Loopring LRC −8.0% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM −5.9% Smart Contract Platform     Insights  Valuing your JPEGs is tough; be careful you don't overestimate  Over the weekend, something weird happened. On Twitter, suddenly Three Arrows Capital was the victim of having its NFT (non-fungible token) fund, Starry Night Capital, undervalued.  DappRadar said Starry Night’s wallet was worth about $3.7 million as of Tuesday.  NFT Twitter didn't like the figure and thinks it should be worth more. Feedback to the article came in fast when it was first posted on Friday saying it was worth less than $5 million, and was often furious.  Blame was put on the DappRadar valuation tool only using the floor price of an NFT, or the lowest price you can “buy in” to a project.  But that’s not true as DappRadar’s algorithm also takes into account the last sale price as well, when available.  DappRadar says its tool uses a machine-learning algorithm to determine appropriate prices based on market conditions.  ""Our algorithm calculates what is the price of an NFT, which is consistent with the historical sales data. It is not precisely predicting, but finding a price that makes sense for the current market conditions. This methodology allows the investor to evaluate how good the trade price is, whilst also assessing the importance of the sale within the collection’s market,"" a DappRadar spokesperson told CoinDesk via email.  Tools that only use floor prices for the collection value the wallet at much less. Value.app, which tracks the floor prices exclusively, puts the wallet's value at around $1.6 million.  NonFungible.com sent us an even higher valuation for the wallet: $19.7 million.  But that comes with a massive caveat. This figure uses the USD price at the date of the sale, Maxime Laglasse, NonFungible.com’s head of content, said in an email.  So that means if an NFT was purchased for 750 ethers in late October, when one ether was worth $4,000, NonFungible.com would maintain that the NFT is still worth $3 million, even though those 750 ethers are now worth closer to $867,770.  “An art asset bought for $3 million months ago can't be devalued because the ETH/USD price lost 50-60%,” Laglasse said. “Only an NFT sale can make the price move in a way or another. That's up to the last buyer to sell or not his asset to make this price move.”  The problems with that argument are that NFT sales are denominated in ether and million-dollar JPEGs are a product of the peak decadence of the bull market. You can’t maintain that an NFT is still worth the last price it was paid for in ether when that ether buys a lot fewer dollars now than it did last year.  If you account for the devaluation of ether, the underlying asset NFTs are denominated in from the time that Three Arrows filled up its wallet until now, there’s an average decline of 70%. That would put NonFungible,com’s valuation closer to $6 million than $19.7 million which is in range of DappRadar’s figure.  And that’s only accounting for the decline in numbers, the quantitative. It’s excluding the qualitative: Is the market still interested in NFTs the same way it was at the height of last year’s bull run?  Of course, all of that is ignoring wash trading (market manipulation designed to create the illusion of demand), which runs rampant in the industry and makes up most of the volume on exchanges such as LooksRare. What’s the real value when so much of it is fake?  Another data point: CryptoPunks  You can get a sense of this gap between perception and reality by diving into the data provided on the CryptoPunk collection (considered to be a blue-chip NFT) by a project called DeepNFTValue, which was recently profiled on CoinDesk.  DeepNFTValue uses an artificial intelligence-based pricing algorithm to determine a CryptoPunk’s value (the team is expanding it to Bored Apes next) and compare it with the asking price and time on the market.  “Only about 10% of Punks have active bids and offers at any point in time, and only a few hundred Punks trade on a given day. Most Punks don't sell for months and have many have never been exchanged for ETH since they were acquired” DeepNFTValue said.  Doing a deep dive into its numbers shows a massive gap between the average seller’s asking price for a CryptoPunk and the value prescribed by DeepNFTValue’s algorithm.  Overall, for the nearly 775 CryptoPunks DeepNFTValue tracks, the average delta (difference between the asking price and value assigned by the algorithm) is 907%. The average time on the market for a CryptoPunk is 152 days, with about 40% of the NFTs being on the market for six months or longer.  When you narrow down the tracker to only the CryptoPunks that have been on the market for a month, that delta in price narrows to 140%. Interestingly, however, when you look at the two- to four-month period the average delta shrinks to 48%, suggesting that when punk holders really want to sell they will tempter their expectations.  It's tough to blame anyone for wanting to sell, especially in a bear market when his other positions might have been rekt – crypto slang for wiped out – because of the broader downturn.  And for wash trading on CryptoPunks themselves? Well, it runs rampant. Using Nansen’s wash trading filter, we can see that the filtered 24-hour volume is 82 ethers while the unfiltered volume, including wash trading, is closer to 2,304 ethers.  Despite the NFT community’s enthusiasm for the asset class, lots of the demand remains fake. Think about this: If there was such deep liquidity and demand, why do firms that offer loans against collateralized NFTs only offer a loan-to-value ratio of 30-50%?  Perhaps the market has determined that JPEGs aren’t the stoic asset class that the loudest members of the NFT community think they are.  Three Arrows' founders are due in court this week, and the hedge fund's creditors are requesting a list of wallets, crypto and other assets they have. Let's see the valuation they put on these NFTs then.  UPDATE (July 13, 10:30 UTC): Updates with a response from DappRadar on how its tool works.  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Crypto Firms, Bitcoin Drops Below $20K Ahead of Inflation Data  DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder explains how retail investors can file claim suits against Celsius Network to attempt to recover their assets as the lender faces insolvency.
