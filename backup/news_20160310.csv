42426676,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw25h,1457648732,Report: Russia to Propose 7-Year Prison Sentences for Digital Currency Issuers,"The Russian Finance Ministry has reportedly tightened its proposed penalties for the issuance of so-called money surrogates including digital currencies.  News service Interfax has reported that, according to an unnamed source in the Russian government, individuals who issue money surrogates face as many as four years in prison. Executives with financial firms that release their own money surrogates could be imprisoned for as many as seven years and be restricted from holding similar positions in the future.  Fines for issuing a money surrogate, according to Interfax, range from 500,000 rubles to 1 million rubles, or roughly $7,000 to $14,000, respectively. Executives from financial firms could pay as much as 2.5 million rubles, or about $35,000.  The report comes as Russia moves closer to formally weighing legislation that, if passed, would govern activities involving money surrogates, a classification of non-government issued currencies that includes bitcoin and other digital currencies. Efforts to formalize restrictions on money surrogates began in 2014.  In February, an advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin issued public statements suggesting that the acceptance of bitcoin would be considered a criminal act.  However, at least one private company is pushing ahead with its plans for a digital currency called BitRuble. Payments firm Qiwi recently said that it is developing the project and working with regulators, including Russia’s central bank, which in the past has indicated its interest in the technology that underlies bitcoin.  QIWI’s plans for BitRuble have drawn fire from some members of the Russian government, and indications suggest that resistance to the project remains.  ""This project can be effective for our market, but there are still misunderstandings concerning the technological and regulatory issues,"" QIWI communications director Konstantin Koltsov told CoinDesk this week.

42426678,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Bh,1457639720,ESMA Director: Blockchain Could Enhance Securities Trading Process,"The executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Union’s top securities watchdog, has said that the agency believes blockchain technology could enhance the post-trade process.  ESMA has spent more than a year investigating the impact of digital currencies like bitcoin on the investment landscape in the EU, and in April, issued a call for more information on the technology.  Executive director Verena Ross spoke earlier this month at an event in the UK organized by the Bank of England and the London Business School. In remarks, Ross indicated that, while the process is still ongoing, ESMA believes the distributed ledgers may see broad usage in the post-trade environment – echoing comments made in January.  Ross stated:  ""We have found that clearing and settlement, collateral management, record of ownership and securities servicing are the areas where the technology is most likely to bring useful changes. It does so through the provision of a unique reference database, instantaneous reconciliation across all participants, immutable shared records and transparent real-time data.""  Yet, Ross said that ESMA sees risks in these possible applications, particularly in the areas of scalability and security, as well as interoperability with existing financial systems.  ""In particular, we question the ability of the [distributed ledger technology] (DLT) to handle large volumes, to manage privacy issues and to ensure a high level of security,"" she said. ""Furthermore, as we anticipate that the DLT is deployed gradually, it will need to demonstrate its ability to interact with certain systems that must continue to co-exist with the DLT, eg trade platforms.""  Further, she said the use of the technology ""may raise fair competition issues if there emerges a monopolistic environment"", arguing that ESMA believes that is a risk that private blockchain systems could result in a loss of transparency for regulators.  ""Although the system is meant to provide enhanced transparency, we believe the use of complex encryption techniques may potentially hinder transparency and regulatory oversight,"" she said.  Ross went on to add that if the technology is successful in overcoming hurdles, global markets could benefit from lower costs, a reduced risk of cybercrime and overal efficiency gains.  She noted that the agency is still conducting its assessment of the technology.  ""ESMA will continue its work on the DLT in an effort to determine whether a regulatory response to the deployment of this technology to financial markets is necessary,"" she concluded.

42426679,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw29h,1457635671,Deloitte: Blockchain Systems Could Rival ACH Network By 2025,"A new report by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services predicts that permissioned blockchain payment systems will see ""significant transaction volume"" by 2020.  Such systems, the report said, could reach the scale of the ACH network, which processes 23 billion transactions annually, by 2025. Elsewhere, it projects that bitcoin and digital currencies will go mainstream, but that many alternative cryptocurrencies would likely vanish or be replaced by ""state-sponsored"" digital currencies.  Deloitte  's findings come as part of a broader report assessing how disruptive forces are expected to reshape the banking industry over the next decade. Additional topics discussed include machine learning and artificial intelligence.  The report suggested that incumbent financial providers are perhaps the most likely to commercialize the opportunity, but that the success of such initiatives would be based on how well blockchain technologies can interoperate.  Deloitte wrote:  ""We believe that corporate payments may have a head start in adopting blockchain technology, given the limited set of entities involved and the strong payment-transaction relationships corporates already have with banks.""  Such a transition, Deloitte said, was likely to ""erode"" product margins at financial institutions, forcing market participants to change how they approach relationships with merchants, consumers, businesses and counterparties. Notably, the professional services firm expects ""all aspects"" of the securities trade cycle to be dominated by digital technologies.  The report recommended that financial incumbents ""ramp up"" efforts to explore the technology while ""rapidly"" developing potential new use cases. Still, it cautioned that the scale and size of the effort needed to bring about this change would pose its own challenges.  The report concluded:  ""In our view, while the promise is real, the path to actualizing the potential will not be easy. There is simply too much legacy overhang in making this transition. It will take enormous effort on a collective basis to migrate to a blockchain-based trading and settlement infrastructure.""

42426689,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Th,1457628748,Toronto Stock Exchange Moves Toward Blockchain With Ethereum Founder Hire,"TMX Group, the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), has taken its first step toward investigating blockchain technology by appointing Anthony Di Iorio as its first chief digital officer.  One of the founders of the ambitious Ethereum project, Di Iorio’s appointment in January follows what he called months of collaboration with TSX that culminated in the creation of the new role.  Di Iorio said that he will now help TSX navigate a number of areas of FinTech innovation more broadly, with the goal of ensuring the exchange is ""on top"" of emerging tech.  The appointment comes at a time when a number of major global stock exchanges are taking similar measures. This includes Nasdaq, Deutsche Börse, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), all of which have either made investments in startups or are exploring applications of the tech.  However, Di Iorio cautioned that despite his background in the technology, that TSX is not likely to launch any Nasdaq-style initiatives as of yet.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We need to make sure we have a strategy that makes sense. Blockchain is one thing we’re looking at, [but] we want a whole technology approach, and blockchain will be one of those things.""  Di Iorio indicated that he is currently considering how best to educate TMX Group employees about blockchain technology, and that any specific tests are subject to further discussion.  ""We’re at strategic stages, with lots of planning. There’s no announced proof-of-concepts yet, but have some in the pipeline we’re considering,"" he said.

42426684,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Jh,1457621198,South Africa's eBay Bidorbuy Adds Bitcoin Payments,"South African online marketplace Bidorbuy has added bitcoin as a payment option.  With the announcement, Bidorbuy now allows sellers to enable bitcoin as a payment method for buyers, using processing services provided by Singapore-based bitcoin service BitX.  Founded in 1999, Bidorbuy is one of the largest South African e-commerce websites, using an eBay-style model to attract some 1.1 million unique monthly viewers and facilitate 80,000 sales monthly.  In statements, Bidorbuy CEO Jaco Jonker emphasized that the decision was a way to offer more diverse payment choices to the site's customers.  Jonker said:  “We believe it is important to provide our buyers and sellers with a choice of payment methods. Bitcoins are convenient and easy to use and although relatively new, the virtual currency has a lot of growth potential.”  South Africa has seen growth in bitcoin use for e-commerce in the past, with payment gateway PayFast partnering with BitX in 2014.  Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of BitX, remarked that he believed the offering will help advance the digital currency in Africa through its use in e-commerce.  ""This integration is also a big milestone in terms of opening up the wider Bitcoin ecosystem in Africa, and should have a strong positive effect on the broader industry,"" he said.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an investment stake in BitX.

42426682,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Fh,1457617052,R3: Biggest-Ever Blockchain Trial is Only the Beginning,"After revealing an impressive string of big bank partnerships toward the end of 2015, blockchain consortium startup R3CEV spent the beginning of this year opening up to the public about its research and development efforts.  First came a test involving next-generation blockchain platform Ethereum in January. However, its biggest show of force came on 3rd March, when it revealed it had conducted a trial that found 40 of its 42 banking partners testing five blockchain technologies in a collaboration distinguished by its size and scope.  While the trial itself was centered on commercial paper trading, a short-term debt security used by large corporates, R3 managing director Tim Grant indicated that the main goal of the test was to emphasize the startup’s own ability to take on a large-scale project.  Grant told CoinDesk:  ""The really key part of the trial was less about the commercial paper and more to demonstrate that we could bring so many institutions and ledger technologies together, not just the classic Ethereum implementation, but to be able to [unite] a West Coast startup like Chain with big established companies.""  Grant described the trial in similarly ambitious terms, indicating that it sent four technology providers specifications for the test – Chain, IBM, Intel and Eris (which delivered versions of the concept on its platform and Ethereum) – that included design specs for three specific trading scenarios.  ""We had [banks] issuing, trading and redeeming commercial paper, and we had every one of those banks do that in the platform,"" Grant said.  He explained that all banks were encouraged to transact with at least one other bank over the course of the trial, with Grant suggesting that ""at least 600 trades"" were completed in the simulations. No real funds were exchanged as part of the test.  Grant suggested that two of R3’s partners declined to participate due to what he called a ""significant resource requirement"".  ""It wasn’t something you could turn up and be passive about. You had to bring human resources and tech resources,"" he said.  Hands-on approach  As for how R3 arrived at the conditions for its test, Grant said tech providers were chosen due to their open-source nature.  Once those involved agreed, he said, timelines for deliverables were kept short in what may be a sign of how adept industry companies are becoming in providing specialized implementations.  ""Over the month of February, we were able to get from a point of delivering the specifications to the tech providers and receiving, toward the middle of February, the appropriate code and access to their ledgers,"" he said.  For the trial, each technology was tested in a ""staged way"" so that banks involved could evaluate the differences. Each bank operated a node on the distributed ledgers being tested, with R3 managing the network.  ""They needed to be hands on. We wanted to have the transparency for our members,"" he said.  Grant said that every few days during the trial period, a tech provider showcased its work to participants. This process enabled R3 clients to, for the first time, have an operational view of how their underlying technologies differed.  “By the close of the trail, we legitimately did have five ledgers and research on how they worked,” he said. “We were able to subjectively evaluate how they do what they do.”  Following the test, all the banks, including those not present, will share in the group’s findings, Grant said.  Upcoming tests  For R3, Grant said the test succeeded at demonstrating the firm’s ability to work at scale and across multiple versions of the technology, but that it intends to do more in 2016.  Going forward, he said, the company plans to drill down into other areas of focus including distributed ledger interoperability, privacy, identity and scalability, and that the tests were likely to be smaller in scale.  ""We fully intend to have a lot of projects with smaller number of banks rather than trying to do 40 banks for all these projects,"" he said. ""It’s better off splitting off into smaller groups.""  Grant said R3 is developing opinions on the technology providers it works with as well, and that it may publish its findings to help its clients understand how to compare the various distributed ledger technologies available.  However, he said, R3’s consortium work is just a part of its focus, and that it’s also working on building architecture and products under the direction of chief technology officer and former IBM executive architect Richard Gendal Brown.  Grant concluded:  ""This is just the beginning, I think there’s going to be a lot of banks and use cases, a lot of different types of projects.""  Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that the R3 blockchain trial featured 600, not 60, trade transactions between participants.
