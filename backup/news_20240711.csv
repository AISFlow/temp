30823343,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629313,1720738853,"Solana Price Tipped For Explosive 1,800% Rally, Analyst Foresees $2,800 Price Target","The Solana price has experienced a significant decline, mirroring the price action of major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) over the past month. However, a crypto analyst has identified a significant parallel between the price movements of Ethereum in 2017 and Solana’s recent price performance. In a recent social media post, crypto analyst Marty suggests that these similarities could lead to a massive price increase for Solana in the coming months, potentially resulting in a 1,800% rally for the Solana price. Solana Price Set For Epic Comeback? After Solana’s explosive uptrend at the beginning of the year, which brought it close to its all-time high of $259 in March, the price has suffered a continuous decline of 58%, reaching a low of $121 on Friday, July 5. However, the crypto analyst has spotted a significant similarity between ETH and SOL’s prices when examining the price action over longer time frames. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Out Of Step With US Equities, What This Could Mean For The Crypto Market Marty highlights that Ethereum and Solana have experienced substantial drawdowns following their respective rallies. For instance, Ethereum faced a 95% drawdown in 2017, while Solana encountered a similar downturn before the 2021 bull run. Notably, after Ethereum’s drawdown in 2017, its price skyrocketed by 2000% over 660 days, reaching an all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021. Building on the similarities between Ethereum’s historical price action and Solana’s current performance, Marty predicts a similar price explosion lies ahead for SOL. Based on his analysis, Marty believes that the market has been around 619 days since the Solana drawdown. By drawing a parallel to Ethereum’s rally timeline, Marty suggests that there may be approximately 50 days remaining before a comparable surge commences for SOL. If Marty’s analysis holds, Solana could be on the cusp of an extraordinary rally with a projected target of $2,800, representing a 1,800% increase from the current price level. Consolidating For Potential Upside Breakout Trading steadily at $140, the Solana price has consolidated above this crucial level for the past two days, maintaining a range between the current prices and $145. While there hasn’t been a significant bounce this week, the significance of this level cannot be overstated, as it serves as a vital support floor for the token, which has been established over five months. This support floor is of utmost importance for bullish investors, as it sets the stage for potential upward movements and acts as a barrier against upper resistance levels. Related Reading: XRP Set To Skyrocket 60,000% On Tightest Bollinger Bands Ever: Analyst In the event of a renewed bullish surge in SOL’s price action, the primary objective for bulls is to surpass the $150 level; this would pave the way to confront the most notable threshold for bears at $170, a resistance level that has persisted for four months. Overcoming this hurdle would potentially unlock further upward momentum, with targets set at $190 and, subsequently, the $200 mark. This would also position the Solana price to aim for its yearly high of $210. Conversely, it is crucial for bullish investors to closely monitor the $134 level, which represents the next significant support floor for the Solana price.

42417743,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZfqf,1720738024,Biden Overtakes VP Harris as Likeliest Dem Nominee on Polymarket During President's Press Conference (Update),"Joe Biden's odds of being the Democratic nominee for president overtook those of his vice president, Kamala Harris following his first press conference in months, according to traders on crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket.  Traders at one point gave him a 51% shot of being the nominee, way up from 33% earlier in the day, according to a contract on Polymarket. The odds were recently back down to 45%.  Meanwhile, Harris' probability of getting the nod dipped as low as 37% before rebounding to 42% at press time.  Biden's chance of victory in November stands at 13%, less than Harris' 15%, according to Polymarket.  Former President and likely Republican nominee Donald Trump remains the favorite to win the White House. ""Yes"" shares in Polymarket's contract for Trump recently traded at 61 cents, and will pay out $1 per share (in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar) if he wins and zilch if not, meaning the market gives him 61% odds of victory.  Biden slurred his words several times during the press conference and mistakenly referred to Harris as ""Vice President Trump,"" but he also spoke in depth about foreign policy issues following a NATO summit and at one point his voice neared a yell as he talked about American children getting killed by guns. The president reiterated that he plans to stay in the race but acknowledged ""it's important that I allay fears"" about his condition.  Concerns about his age and cognitive health have led to widespread calls among prominent Democrats and donors, including actor George Clooney, for the president to step aside, despite his insistence he is staying in.  Hundreds of millions of dollars are riding on the election's outcome on Polymarket, which is enjoying a breakout year despite having to geofence U.S. users under a regulatory settlement.

30820331,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629236,1720733458,Bitcoin Crash Forced Weak Hands Into Largest Loss-Taking Since 2022 Lows: Report,"A new report from Glassnode has revealed that the Bitcoin short-term holders took part in the largest loss-taking event since 2022 in the recent crash. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Have Realized Huge Losses Recently According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, less than 1% of trading days in the cryptocurrency’s history have seen the short-term holders taking higher losses than during the latest event. The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. This cohort makes up one of the two main market divisions based on holding time, with the other group being called the “long-term holders” (LTHs). Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the LTHs reflect the stubborn side of the market, which can weather through crashes and rallies, while the STHs include the weak hands that easily react to FUD or FOMO. Related Reading: Chainlink Traders Capitulate After 10% Plunge: Bottom Here? Given this fact, it’s not unexpected that this latter cohort has again shown a strong reaction to the recent volatility in the Bitcoin price. And since it’s been a crash, the STHs have been panic selling at a loss. The below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Loss specifically for the STHs over the past few years: The Realized Loss here is an indicator that keeps track of the total loss the STHs realize through their selling. Also, note that the metric is “entity-adjusted,” meaning that the metric includes the data for entities instead of addresses. An entity refers to a cluster of addresses that Glassnode has determined to belong to the same investor through its analysis. Transactions made between the wallets of the same investor would naturally not correspond to any real “loss-taking,” so excluding them from the data makes sense. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin STH Realized Loss registered a spike during the latest market downturn, implying that these investors made large transactions at a loss. At the height of this capitulation event, the indicator’s value hit $595 million, the largest loss-taking the cohort has shown since the FTX collapse that led to the bottom of the 2022 bear market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Forming Pattern That Last Led To It Blasting Off “Furthermore, only 52 out of 5655 trading days (< 1%) have recorded a larger daily loss value, highlighting the severity of this correction in dollar terms,” reads the report. From the chart, it would appear that large spikes in the metric have come around at least local bottoms in the price, so this loss-taking event may have also formed another bottom for Bitcoin.

The company's premium to BTC decreased from 90% to 78%. MicroStrategy raised another $800 million in June through convertible notes, the proceeds of which were used to buy more BTC. The recently announced stock split may increase liquidity for MSTR shares as it potentially attracts more retail buyers at the lower price point. On March 19th, Seeking Alpha published my article covering MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) in which I said the company's stock had traveled ""too far, too fast."" Despite MSTR shares being my top pick for 2024 just four months prior, I had sold my position based on the assumption that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) would decline and bring MSTR shares down with it. Though certainly not in a straight line, those assumptions have since panned out and both BTC and MSTR are now down against a broader Nasdaq that has added 15% since mid-March: Data by YCharts Admittedly, MSTR has held up better than BTC since my article, and that's somewhat surprising to me. One of my primary arguments in ""Too Far, Too Fast"" was that MSTR's stock valuation relative to the Bitcoin that the company holds should not be trading at a significant premium to the value of the BTC, let alone the 90% premium MSTR shares commanded at the time. To put it mildly, this point was debated in the comments section, where I was assured that the premium was too low and could even revisit 5 to 6x BTC value. In this update, we'll again look at MicroStrategy's premium to BTC stack, the company's latest purchases of BTC since my previous note, and the recent announcement of a stock split. The Premium On the surface, it appears as though my insistence that it is preposterous to pay a 90% premium for the BTC on MicroStrategy's balance sheet has been wrong. Afterall, BTC has declined by more than MSTR shares since mid-March. However, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin premium has actually gone down from 90% in mid-March to just 78% as of 7/10/24 close, based on a $13.0 billion BTC HODL and a $23.2 billion market cap. I still believe this premium is too high, and I will die on this hill. Key reasons: MicroStrategy already commands significant valuation multiples based on the business' fundamentals, such as earnings or revenue. The presumption that shareholders should get an additional multiple of 5 to 6 times the company's BTC liquidity fails for me. The Bitcoin is not a productive asset, as it's not monetized or utilized in any way. In my view, to justify paying a premium for this BTC, it would have to be generating a yield of some kind - which it isn't. And even then, the premium should be well below 78%. Data by YCharts Purely on business fundamentals, the stock is highly overvalued at nearly 50x forward sales. Especially considering MicroStrategy has often produced negative quarterly net income. To be sure, these shares are a Bitcoin play more than they're an investment in MicroStrategy as a business. I understand why some MSTR bulls believe the stock should garner a premium to the BTC liquidity, I just don't agree with them, and we can probably leave it at that. Fresh BTC Purchases In June, MicroStrategy raised an additional $800 million in convertible senior notes due in 2032. The interest rate on this recent round of notes is 2.25%. This is a noticeable increase from the company's March offerings, which were 0.875% and 0.625%. Those March notes collectively raised $1.4 billion and are due in 2030 and 2031. Thus, this last round isn't at quite the favorable terms for MicroStrategy as the previous offerings. In any case, the proceeds from MicroStrategy's June offering were immediately put to work through purchases of an additional 11,931 BTC at an average price of $65,883 per coin . Purchase History (BitcoinTreasuries.net) The company now holds 226,331 BTC in treasury, with a little over $3.7 billion before interest due between 2027-2032. Despite a 12% haircut on the value of the Bitcoin purchased last month, the corporate treasury management strategy has been simply fascinating to watch. I question how long Executive Chairman Michael Saylor can continue doing this, but so far, borrowing in dollars long term to buy Bitcoin now is working quite well. The Stock Split If we operate with the assumption that Michael Saylor wants to buy this big dip in BTC, the recently announced MSTR stock split makes quite a bit of sense. While stock splits don't fundamentally change the value of the equity, they do theoretically grow liquidity for a company's stock. For instance, at $1,350 per share, retail buyers may be less likely to purchase MSTR because of either share price sticker shock or an inability to buy fragmented shares through their broker. With MicroStrategy's planned 10 for 1 stock split coming in early August, 17 million shares at $1,350 turn into 170 million at $135. This makes buying MSTR far more palatable for lower net worth investors. NVDA Daily (TrendSpider) Again, there is no fundamental change to the underlying business or equity that makes MSTR shares more attractive to potential buyers. But there is precedent for stock splits leading to higher valuation, shortly after splitting. Recently, NVIDIA ( NVDA ) just did a similar 10-1 split in June, and the price of the stock rallied nearly 16% over the seven sessions that followed. Even in the event that MSTR doesn't garner the same kind of post-split rally that NVDA did in June, the very notion that MSTR is doing the split at all may push MSTR prices higher as traders try to front run retail buyers who would hypothetically acquire shares post-split. Risks Leverage works great in a bull run, it's a bit more problematic in a bear market. Bitcoin is still very much in a bull market, but the top crypto has much shorter bull/bear cycles than what equity investors are likely used to and there is a fairly high likelihood Bitcoin will enter another bear before MicroStrategy's convertible notes are due. Data by YCharts Given the company's anemic growth in the underlying business, it's unlikely that cashflow from operations can be used for redemption of the convertible notes. Which means MicroStrategy will either have to sell down the Bitcoin stack to deliver note holders cash or dilute shareholders. I suspect MicroStrategy will go with the latter approach. Conclusion Believe it or not, I still actually like MicroStrategy at the right price. However, I don't think an 80% premium to the value of the company's BTC is where I'm a buyer. I think this stock is phenomenal as a trading proxy for Bitcoin. But as a long term investment, I see issues; the underlying business isn't growing and capital gains in the equity are entirely dependent on Bitcoin's price going up. And if you believe that last part is a certainty, you're probably better off just buying Bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703604-microstrategy-i-still-cant-justify-buying?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30819249.jpeg

While some see the meme coin struggling for the foreseeable future, others expect the coin to resume its rally and actually reach a new all-time high. A new Forbes report falls in the latter category, expecting a significant surge in price towards new highs. Shiba Inu Price To Reach New ATH In the Forbes report, the Shiba Inu token is lauded for its development and growing utility, pushing it to become the 13th-largest cryptocurrency in the space. However, over the last few years, the price has struggled and has failed to reclaim its $0.00008 all-time high despite the bitcoin price reaching new highs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price In Trouble Amid 108 Million DOGE Dump On Robinhood The report points to a number of predictions, while tracing the performance of Shiba Inu through the years. One notable prediction is that of Utkarsh Tiwari, the chief strategy officer of KoinBX. Tiwari predicts that the price of SHIB could rally more than 100% from its current level to reach above $0.00003. The strategist believes that this could happen for the meme coin sometime around the end of 2024. However, for Forbes, a more realistic price point for the meme coin was set at $0.0001 to $0.0003. This deviates from Tiwari’s upper bound of $0.000396 for 2024, as it is a reasonable distance away from the current SHIB price of $0.000016. In the longer time frame, Tiwari predicts that the Shiba Inu price could go as high as $0.0000456 in favourable market conditions by 2025. However, pointing to “technological advancements and regulatory updates,” the report puts the price as high as $0.00007488 for 2025. SHIB Sees Dwindling Pressure Amid the high expectations for the Shiba Inu price, the meme coin has continued to struggle in the market. The market sell-offs affected the price over the last week, pushing it down to retest the support at $0.000016. Although the support held, it has shown how much pressure the bears are putting on the price. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Reach $100,000, But What About Altcoins? On the volume front, the SHIB token is still struggling, as CoinMarketCap data shows a 22% decline in the last 24 hours alone. However, this could be good for the meme coin as it could mean that sellers are running out of steam, which could see the price push back up once again.

30817120,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629370,1720727957,"X Silences Artist, Is Freedom of Expression Lost? Does Elon Know?","The enigmatic artist Mr. Black, known for his cryptic street art and ambitious 21,000-piece ordinal collection on the Bitcoin blockchain, claims that his attempts to advertise on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) have been blocked. This raises questions about potential censorship and the influence of powerful entities behind the scenes. Mr. Black has garnered global attention with his mysterious posters and stickers in cities like Jerusalem, Rome, Mexico City, Paris, and Tel Aviv. His bold claim that the Messianic Age will be revealed once his entire collection is fully minted has sparked both excitement and skepticism. In a series of posts, Mr. Black alleges that X has systematically blocked his attempts to promote his collection. This is concerning given the platform’s role in reaching a global audience. The Role of GARM Mr. Black speculates that the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) may be responsible. GARM, a controversial organization supposedly aims to ensure brand safety and reduce harmful content in advertising, but its guidelines can sometimes be overly restrictive. GARM has been in the news recently and has been subject to a congressional hearing. Mr. Black’s Allegations Mr. Black’s allegations raise several critical questions: Why has X blocked Mr. Black’s advertisements? Is GARM’s influence suppressing controversial art and messages? Are powerful figures depicted in Mr. Black’s art influencing this decision? Is Elon Musk aware of GARM’s potential influence within X? Recently, Mr. Black has posted provocative art pieces featuring figures like Elon Musk (@elonmusk), Dana White (@danawhite), Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos), CZ from Binance (@cz_binance), and Ayatollah Khamenei (@khamenei_ir). These artworks critique the roles these individuals play in global affairs and technology. Implications of the Block Blocking Mr. Black’s advertisements suggests efforts to limit the reach of his message. This raises broader concerns about freedom of expression, particularly for artists who challenge powerful entities. Key Questions Is Mr. Black being unfairly targeted due to the controversial nature of his work? How transparent are X’s advertising policies, and what role does GARM play? The Stakes Advertising on X is crucial for Mr. Black to reach a wider audience and fulfill his goals. His declaration that minting out his collection will reveal the Messianic Age—a time of universal peace and enlightenment—requires significant visibility. Conclusion As Mr. Black’s countdown to the reveal continues, the art and crypto communities are watching closely. The alleged advertising block on X adds complexity to his mysterious persona. Whether or not Mr. Black’s vision of the Messianic Age will come to pass, the controversy highlights the ongoing struggle for artistic freedom in the digital age. The world waits to see if Mr. Black can overcome these obstacles and fulfill his ambitious prophecy.

According to our investigation, Eshniyozov Shohjaxon Akmal Ogli first dived into the Forex market over 12 years ago.

The Forex trading strategy allowed the trader to avoid losses, and just two years later, the Wolf of Uzbekistan recorded an impressive Profit and Loss ratio of 7 million euros, a testament to his unparalleled success in the Forex market. One of the most impressive aspects of his story is his capacity to absorb knowledge and turned into practical applications to trade currencies. Our investigation indicates that Shohjaxon had no mentors and, in less than a decade, read over 320 books on the Forex Market to develop his trading style and strategies.

Judge Katherine Polk Failla, of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, scheduled a hearing on short notice Thursday after SEC attorneys asked her to block a Coinbase subpoena last month directed at Gensler. The judge said she was ""actually quite surprised by the request"" made to Gensler in his personal capacity at the start of the hearing. Near the end, after both parties had explained their arguments, she indicated she still believed Coinbase's request was inappropriate but asked the exchange to file a motion to compel for a formal proceeding where both parties can brief their arguments more in depth.  ""I imagined that there was something I was missing,"" she said at the outset. ""Let me note that counsel on both sides is very smart, very clever, they’re all very clever people…but I was kind of surprised and not in a good way. I found the arguments at least as articulated in the July 3rd response to border on the fatuous.""  ""I was not moved by basically any of the arguments,"" she said.  The judge took specific issue with Coinbase requesting documents from Gensler predating his term as chair of the regulatory agency. Kevin Schwartz, an attorney with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz representing Coinbase, said the agency has refused to even discuss the totality of the documents Coinbase might have, but that Gensler's communications were relevant to the case.  Jorge Tenreiro, an SEC senior trial attorney, said Gensler's communications before he became chair of the agency were not relevant to the case, adding that the SEC chair is neither a fact nor expert witness in the case and could set a concerning precedent in future cases.  Near the end of the hearing, the judge told Schwartz that she had ""strong views"" on the value of Gensler's statements from before he took the reins at the federal agency and that she was still leaning toward the SEC's view that the requests were inappropriate.  Still, the judge asked the two parties to get together and work on a briefing schedule, suggesting that rather than working off of the SEC's motion to quash, she'd like Coinbase to file a motion to compel and work through the process that way.  Coinbase subpoena  The crypto exchange initially served the SEC with requests for the production of documents in April. In June, Coinbase told the SEC that it also planned to subpoena SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s personal communications related to crypto over the course of his tenure, plus four years before he was appointed Chairman.  In a letter to the court on June 28, the SEC pushed back, calling the subpoena request an ""improper intrusion"" into Gensler’s private life and arguing that any subpoena should be directed at the SEC, not at individual employees of the agency.  ""Given also the utter lack of relevance of the requested documents, and the potential chilling effect on public service, the Court should quash the Subpoena and issue a protective order,"" lawyers for the SEC argued.  Coinbase's Schwartz, during Thursday's hearing, said the SEC's charges included conduct from before Gensler was chair, though Tenreiro responded that the charges are specific to Coinbase's conduct and not Gensler's communications as a private citizen.  Fair game?  In their July 3 response to the SEC’s letter to the court, lawyers for Coinbase argued that it is fair game to subpoena Gensler’s personal communications because he is ""not only the most prominent regulator, but also the most vocal academic commentator, concerning the regulatory status of digital assets and exchanges,"" and often speaks publicly while expressing that his views are his personal views, not that of the SEC.  ""What Mr. Gensler was saying in his private communications about the regulatory status of digital assets, and what market participants were saying to him about these matters, is probative of the objective understanding of the public and market participants regarding what conduct the securities laws prohibit,"" Coinbase’s lawyers wrote. ""[A] document or communication need not be public to provide insight into the public's objective understanding as to what regulators require of them: agency personnel’s communications with market participants and interagency correspondence are all 'relevant to the fair notice defense.'""",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Nikhilesh De, Cheyenne Ligon",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/11/judge-sends-coinbase-back-to-the-drawing-board-over-efforts-to-subpoena-secs-gary-gensler,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8cd5049a00576d1f5283c6f9a5b5257f70a7b76-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Compliance in Malta is way more lenient, and that's not the tag you want to have when you're in crypto and trying to make it in the EU,"" said a person with direct knowledge of OKX's European regulatory efforts.  The cryptocurrency exchange is looking to fill several high-profile roles in Malta, including head of compliance, operations lead and head of internal audit.  OKX, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, plans to make the Mediterranean island of Malta its European hub and base for compliance with the newly arrived Markets in Crypto assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, according to two people familiar with the matter.  It's a change of tack for OKX, which said in May of last year that France would be its preferred European Union hub. OKX's France arm has been registered with France's financial regulator Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) since December.  ""Compliance in Malta is way more lenient, and that's not the tag you want to have when you're in crypto and trying to make it in the EU,"" said a person with direct knowledge of OKX's European regulatory efforts.  OKX declined to comment on the Malta decision.  Companies have been looking to get registered with one of the European Union's 27 nations to get ready for upcoming MiCA rules, which require firms to secure a crypto asset service provider, or CASP, license with an EU nation to operate across the entire bloc.  First, firms need to have a physical presence in that nation, carry out some business in the country and already be registered to get the CASP license. MiCA's stablecoin rules are already in place but the rest of the rules will come through in December.  Malta, which is home to many gaming companies and some investment firms, has embraced crypto in recent years. In late 2023, Malta's Financial Services Authority (MFSA) updated its rules for crypto companies to fall in line with the oncoming MiCA regime.  The exchange is looking to fill several high-profile roles in Malta, including head of compliance, operations lead and head of internal audit.

Bitcoin wallets linked to the German authorities transferred a total of 10,567 BTC worth over $600 million in multiple batches during the day to crypto exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken and other service providers such as Flow Traders and Cumberland DRW, blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence shows.  After today's transactions, the wallets linked to the authorities held only 4,925 BTC worth $285 million at current prices, down from the 50,000 BTC worth nearly $3 billion since they started selling the assets three weeks ago.  This means that Germany's bitcoin selling spree could be over as soon as Friday or early next week at the current pace, given that the wallets unloaded roughly 35,000 BTC so far this week.  Read more: It's Not Germany Selling Bitcoin. It's One of Its States and It Has No Choice.  The tally could change in the later hours because of the wallet's odd practice of receiving a part of the transferred assets, at times in the $10 million range, back from exchanges and brokers before the end of the day. (Greg Cipolaro, the head of research at digital asset manager NYDIG , called the on-chain activity ""perplexing"" in a Wednesday note.)  The looming finish of Germany's $3 billion selling spree could allay crypto investors' fears, who have been fixated on the on-chain movements of large potential sellers on the market over the past few weeks, tying the recent downturn in asset prices to concerns over supply overhang.  Bitcoin's 15% correction over the past month coincided with the U.S. government, which holds over $12 billion in seized bitcoin, moving $240 million worth of Silk Road-related BTC to Coinbase and the estate of the defunct Japanese exchange Mt. Gox starting repayments of 140,000 BTC to creditors this month, who might want to cash out after ten years of waiting.

30814019,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629290,1720722647,Analyst Predicts Major Gains for These Altcoins But Warn Against XRP and ADA,"Amid the recent downturn in the global crypto market, a recent Crypto Banter Dylan’s Trading Show session has caught the eye with some bold claims regarding what comes next for Solana and Ethereum and some negative sentiment on XRP and ADA. Over the past years, crypto analysts in the industry have been discovering and analyzing patterns in the market because this could help them predict future directions. So far, a decrease in Bitcoin‘s dominance is considered good for altcoins. According to the Crypto Banter Show analyst, this change could potentially signal more diversified investing in altcoins and a market bullishness towards lesser-known chains. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Reach $100,000, But What About Altcoins? Focus on Growth: Altcoins to Watch Despite the caution against investing in what is labeled ‘dead coins’ like XRP and ADA, Dylan’s Trading Show analyst expressed a more optimistic outlook for coins such as Solana and Ethereum. The analyst noted that if Bitcoin loses dominance, a series of massive moves upward could be in store for these altcoins. In particular, he forecasts that Solana could find support levels around $137 to $139 should the market continue its current momentum without breaking key technical barriers. As for Ethereum, the analyst discloses that ETH is approaching a critical juncture at the 200-day Moving Average (MA). If Ethereum breaks through and holds this level, it will trigger a domino effect to the upside, positively impacting small-cap altcoins. Should You Stay Away From XRP and ADA? While the analyst has mentioned XRP and ADA as “dead coins”— which means they might not have much potential for growth in the near term, it is worth noting that these assets are still seeing their share of optimism and bullishness from their respective community. Earlier today, an analyst revealed the potential for XRP to experience a massive rally due to the emergence of “one of the tightest monthly Bollinger Band squeezes in its history.” According to the analyst, the last time this indicator was seen, “XRP shot up 60,000%.” On the other hand, ADA is on the cusp of a new development with the upcoming Chang Hard Fork. IntoTheBlock states, “before its previous hard fork in 2021, ADA surged 130%, from $1.35 to $3.10 in just a month.” This signals a possible price surge for ADA, reminiscent of past gains following significant updates or forks within the blockchain.

Even though there are some optimists, the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart points to weakness. This preview, at least from a technical angle, remains as long as prices trend below the round number of $60,000 and the liquidation level at around $66,000. Binance Bought The Bitcoin Dip Amid the recovery, one analyst, pointing to interesting on-chain data, observed that when prices fell last week, some unnamed exchanges were loading up the dip. It is now emerging that Binance, the world’s largest exchange by client count, was actively accumulating. CryptoQuant data shows that Binance increased its reserves by 41,000 BTC over the last bear run when prices corrected from $72,000. Buying on dips is strategic, considering the exchange’s obligation, especially for users seeking to convert other tokens for BTC on the fly instantaneously. Related Reading: XRP Set To Skyrocket 60,000% On Tightest Bollinger Bands Ever: Analyst During this time, Ki Young Ju also noted that “permanent holders,” entities who tend to HODL and not move coins, have been accumulating. These addresses, excluding spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers, exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, or miners, added 85,000 BTC in the last month. During this time, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers decreased their holding by 16,000 BTC. While some entities were scrambling for the exits, others saw this as an opportunity to double down, loading on every retracement. Their involvement has helped stabilize prices, improving sentiment shredded after last week’s dump to as low as $53,500. German Government Offloading More BTC Even as the “diamond hands” buy the dip, the German government is not stopping; looking at Arkham Intelligence data. Today, on July 11, they moved another 3,250 BTC, on top of the 5,627 sent earlier, to multiple market makers and exchanges, including Bitstamp. Their decision to sell is heaping more pressure on the coin, slowing down the uptrend. Even amid sustained outflows from the German government, a Coingecko survey shows that most respondents, especially investors, are upbeat. Related Reading: Filecoin Boom Incoming?

42417723,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZg69,1720716993,Why I Chose Bitcoin Ordinals to Release ‘Frontline’,"I like to say that I do pixels very well, but I'm not a blockchain expert. I fear anything that is related to statistics and security, as any mistake usually means that you are completely wrong (when dealing with statistics) or you lose a lot of money (when it comes to security). Writing a smart contract is for me a daunting task. This does not mean I am clueless about the underlying technology that powers blockchains and NFTs/Ordinals, though: just that I stop at understanding.  For my latest collection, I am partnering with Metagood, the creators of Ordinals collection OnChainMonkey, to release it on the Ordinals protocol. This collection will be my first on Bitcoin, which is different from what I used in the past (mostly NFTs on Ethereum and Tezos) and is taking all the lessons learned from other chains to do some smart things out of the box.  What Ordinals offer  First thing that I love about Ordinals is that it has to be on-chain. That's it. No external assets, no links. What you have is what you get. Many generative art pieces rely on code libraries (e.g. p5.js, three.js) to help with the commonly used features that are needed to generate the pieces.  Read more: Daniel Kuhn - Casey Rodarmor: The Bitcoin Artist  The protocol has a solution to this problem that is elegant by design. Any Ordinal can refer to another Ordinal. It could be a library, it could be an asset, it could be the whole thing to create remixes. It is up to you to find creative uses of the feature. You can find the widely used libraries on-chain, on Bitcoin: p5js, three.js are there already. You know who uploaded them? Danny Yang, creator of OnChainMonkey.  But how does this work exactly? How can my Ordinal refer to another Ordinal? On Ethereum (and others as far as I know), NFTs are basically token IDs that are issued from a given contract. You then need the contract address to explore which NFTs are there, and who owns them.  Ordinals found (again) a clever solution to that issue. This feature is called recursion. A Bitcoin is a collection of one hundred million of satoshis, each with a number, according to their minting order. An Ordinal is tied to a unique Satoshi, so they are ordered. Hence they are called Ordinals. You can use another Ordinal (or other Ordinals) in your Ordinal to make a new Ordinal. You can then create complex pieces using different assets already there, and anyone can access them.  The other feature that is also interesting is the parent-child relationship. It is similar to the recursion feature in the sense that it is a reference to another Ordinal. But this one is secured in the same way blockchains work (remember the crypto part of ""cryptocurrency""? That refers to signing messages using cryptography, the business with private keys/public keys). You can only refer to another Ordinal as the parent if you can prove that you own that Ordinal.  What can you do with this? It turns out this is also a smart way to establish provenance and even more. You can make one Ordinal your signature and use it to be a parent of all your future pieces. You can make one Ordinal the ""generator"" of a generative collection and have all the individual mints of that collection refer to the code as their parent. And even more.  Ordinals offer elegant solutions to serve the purpose of creating generative art collections on the Bitcoin chain. They, of course, are not as flexible as smart contracts and do not aim to be. They provide enough to build awesomeness.  FrontLine  FrontLine is my latest long-form generative art collection. I am honored to be able to share it with you, this time on Ordinals, with the OnChainMonkey community as the intended audience at first. It took me more or less one year to get to the finish line, and it is a personal journey.  ""FrontLine"" reflects what happened recently at various levels. The piece was challenging to create and satisfying to finalize. From the beginning this was meant to be a piece in collaboration with OnChainMonkey. I was in part inspired by the general ethos behind the community around OCM: nudging people towards ""good,” but there is no clear definition of good, only vague cultural concepts around what societies accept as values to aim for. Good only exists if its opposite makes sense: there is a dimension of good versus bad, lawful versus chaotic, light versus dark, A versus B. Two sides of something, with something in between.  Listen: Runes and Ordinals ‘Artist’ Creator, Casey Rodarmor on 'The Protocol'  FrontLine tries to represent this struggle, this fight that happens in every moment. What appeared to be an obvious ""good"" choice a few seconds ago is now its opposite thanks to additional knowledge. The split between the two sides is never a clear cut: the battle rages on, and a lot is happening at the Frontline.  The piece combines a couple of algorithms that are competing to occupy the space: one that will look for the negative space and one that will try to connect the dots; the connecting algorithm is also clearly split into two sides with different approaches to the task at hand. How each new iteration of the algorithm is almost unpredictable yet explainable a posteriori: the rules of the underlying algorithms are actually pretty straightforward. Once the whole space has been explored, the battle begins and the frontline appears, sometimes complex and vibrant, sometimes spotty and vague – yet always present.  There is no perfect world. There is no good without bad. What matters is where to draw the frontline. It is up to you to find what you would want both sides to be. It could be ETH/BTC. I personally root for the people that innovate: they will be at the FrontLine.  Do I have an answer to all the questions? No. I just know that you have to try things to move forward. You have to be where it happens. You have to fight there. You have to be at the FrontLine.

42417719,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZg21,1720716604,SEC Commissioner Grilled on Bitcoin ETFs as Senators Weigh U.S. Regulator Nominees,"Four nominees for regulatory positions across the Biden administration were questioned in a Senate Banking Committee confirmation hearing on Thursday.  Crypto only came up a few times, including in the questioning of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Caroline Crenshaw on bitcoin trading products.  Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) told senators on Thursday that rampant fraud in crypto markets left her unwilling to approve bitcoin exchange traded products earlier this year.  In a nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Crenshaw and others seeking Senate confirmations defended their records. Crypto issues received only minimal attention, including in the questioning of Crenshaw as she seeks another SEC term.  In January, after the SEC lost a court battle with Grayscale and reversed its position on bitcoin spot exchange traded funds (ETFs), Crenshaw maintained her opposition to those trading products, which she pointed out aren't technically ETFs but are exchange traded products (ETPs) that operate under different rules. The commissioner said that the agency's approval of the bitcoin {{BTC}} products would ""put us on a wayward path that could further sacrifice investor protection.""  In weighing whether it was in the public interest, she reiterated on Thursday that she felt she had to oppose it ""given the significant fraud in the underlying spot markets globally, given the opacity.""  ""I am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of U.S. households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets and will impact the ETPs,"" Crenshaw had argued in January. Her agency is now in the process of similarly approving trading products for Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}.  The committee also heard testimony Thursday from Christy Goldsmith Romero, the member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who President Joe Biden tapped to chair the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.; Kristin Johnson, another CFTC commissioner, to be the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial institutions; and Hawaii Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito to be a Member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  Crenshaw has been a commissioner at the SEC since being sworn in four years ago, having been unanimously confirmed in the Senate. In that tenure, she's backed the approach to the digital assets sector led by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has maintained a view that crypto tokens should mostly be approached as securities that must be registered with the agency.  This round of four nominations for financial regulatory positions is especially significant for the CFTC, which would lose two Democratic members if their appointments are confirmed. It's uncertain how effective that agency – key to digital assets oversight and enforcement – will be if it loses two of its five commissioners and leaves Chair Rostin Behnam as the only Democrat appointee.  The nomination process for financial watchdogs requires approval initially in this committee, then a vote by the entire Senate.  Thursday's hearing also briefly raised the question of the custody of digital assets at U.S. banks. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) asked Goldsmith Romero about her view on banks handling customers' cryptocurrency and doing other business with digital assets firms.  ""I don't think it's the FDIC's role to tell banks what industries or companies banks should be providing services to,"" the commissioner responded.

Both of those equity averages closed in the green for the seventh consecutive day on Wednesday, with both hitting all-time highs. For the S&P 500, it was its 37th record close of 2024 and for the Nasdaq, its 27th, according to MarketWatch.  A report yesterday in The Block noted that bitcoin's correlations with those gauges had fallen to multi-month lows – to minus 0.84 with the Nasdaq and minus 0.82 with the S&P 500. (A reading of minus 1 would mean they're moving essentially the same amount but in opposite directions.)  Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With Nasdaq  That's not the case today. They're all moving in lockstep. But unfortunately for the bulls, it's as stocks have turned sharply lower. At midday New York time, the Nasdaq is lower by 1.8% and the S&P 500 by 0.9%. Bitcoin, which earlier in the session climbed above $59,000 on welcome U.S. inflation news, is now lower by 0.6% to $57,500. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index is down 0.4%.  There could be further downside for cryptocurrencies if the equity market's bad day turns into a broader correction, Joel Kruger, market strategist at the LMAX Group, said in a morning update.  ""Right now, the biggest risk we see to crypto assets is the risk that highly overbought U.S. equities could be on the verge of rolling over,"" Kruger said.

42417710,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZfun,1720714689,How Digital Collectibles Are Shaping Athlete Legacies,"Since the dawn of sport, athletes have built their legacy out on the playing field. We look up to their accomplishments; we hold on to their records, their milestones, and the countless moments that make up their wins. Starting in the 2010s, the introduction of social media transformed the playing field: giving us more access and insight into star players. A decade later, the emergence of NFTs gave fans and their favorite athletes a new way to connect. Now, blockchain-based collectibles and games are changing the way we see and engage with athletes: as fans increasingly have the tools to contribute to, own, and expand the field of play for their favorite stars.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's GameFi Week 2024.  Preparing for the upcoming Summer Olympics games in Paris, Michel Cadot advised the Prime Minister’s Office to implement blockchain ticketing for all major sports events around the Olympics held in Paris. Individuals would receive their tickets as rotating QR codes via blockchain technology, with NFT tickets sent a few days before the event. These tickets will activate within a specific perimeter of the event location to reduce ticket fraud but also allow event goers to have a lasting memory on the blockchain.  As we see events like the Olympics and Leagues like the NFL, NBA, and MLB all experimenting with blockchain and NFTs in different ways, it begs the question – will on-chain assets be the future of athlete’s legacies? Let’s dive into how this technology is used to date and what this can mean for decades to come.  NFTs allow fans to own a moment  NFTs allow fans to own a piece of the game by immortalizing iconic moments as digital collectibles. This preservation extends the game's impact beyond its venue, creating a timeless connection between fans and their favorite sports. By owning these unique digital recreations, fans can engage with the sport on a deeper level, experiencing a sense of ownership and participation that goes beyond merely watching or interacting on social media. This innovative use of blockchain technology ensures that memorable plays and legendary highlights can live forever, enhancing fan loyalty and engagement.  For example, a recent collaboration between AC Milan and Fanblock has tokenized the stadium experience. Fans can obtain virtual plots of land within stadiums, earning rewards based on in-game events that take place in their area during official matches, such as goals, assists, and yellow cards. In 2022, the AO announced a celebratory NFT collection called Art Balls, featuring 6,776 unique digital tennis balls. Fans and creators can submit designs for these NFTs. Owning an NFT grants access to a digital tennis court in Decentraland's Metaverse, where historical competition highlights are streamed. Additionally, each NFT is linked to a specific section of the physical court, and owners of the section where the winning shot lands will receive exclusive game data.  In addition, Major League Baseball (MLB), now offers game highlights in both historical and recent games, allowing fans to own a piece of content they could not before that can forever memorialize a favorite moment or a game that they attended. MLB also allows fans to own memorabilia from players in a digital format, paving a new way to support favorite players that goes beyond a physical piece of memorabilia or trading card that could get lost, stolen, ripped or broken. With these assets living on-chain and forever verified, fans lessen these previously associated risks giving longer life to these valuable pieces.  Star careers can become exponential  Professional athletes, some of the most physically and mentally gifted individuals, have long struggled to fully capitalize on their personal value. Traditional physical auctions often fail to capture revenue for the athlete or their estate. By leveraging NFTs, athletes can create new revenue streams that extend beyond their active career years, which typically last only 5-7 years. Agencies like Young Money APAA Sports are now providing clients with their own digital player cards, enabling athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness and collect royalties on any resales.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - What Hamster Kombat Did: How Telegram Built a Web3 Gaming Juggernaut  This digital approach allows athletes to capitalize on their fame and achievements in perpetuity, ensuring they benefit financially from their legacy. NFTs not only democratize the auction process by eliminating intermediaries but also provide athletes with ongoing opportunities to monetize their career highlights, memorabilia, and unique digital content directly to fans. Tiger Woods, Khabib Nurmagomedov, Stephen Curry, Micah Johnson, Son Heung Min, Rafael Nadal, Lionel Messi, Tony Hawk, Tom Brady, Usain Bolt, Wayne Gretzky are just a few examples of athletes who have officially licensed NFT collections.  Fan tokens allow supporters to make decisions  We’ve also seen the rise of sports organizations utilizing Fan Tokens – unlike NFTs, these are fungible, or interchangeable, crypto tokens that can be used as currency to exchange for merchandise, VIP experiences and more. These tokens are utilized in almost a DAO-type structure, meaning when a holder amasses enough tokens they are granted the ability to vote on club matters like designs, ticketing matters, and match locations. Fan Tokens give way to new and exciting possibilities for fans who are already ingrained in their favorite club’s activities allowing them to feel the rewards of a team's successes and grow their loyalty even further.  While the Chiliz Fan Token arose as the first of its kind, popular clubs such as Manchester City and AC Milan have integrated this system as well. Not only do these tokens benefit the fans who decide to participate, but they also give the clubs a new stream of revenue which benefits the club as a whole, its players, and the fans alike.  Web3 games let fans be general managers  Web3 has also wrapped its hands around gaming, offering a plethora of what can be iterated on when it comes to traditional gaming. While there have been hits and misses when it comes to Web3 gaming, there has been a lot of success when it comes to how Web3 gaming interacts with different aspects of sports. These games offer fans the ability to take on the role of general manager to their favorite teams or interact with their favorite players, bridging the real-world and the virtual world. Games leveraging blockchain as an underlying technological mechanism allow users to own, trade, and manage digital assets while also using crypto to blend investments with strategy and entertainment.  Mobile and browser-based Web3 games are really at the forefront of the growth in Web3 sporting games. For example, Sorare is a fantasy football game where users can collect officially licensed digital collectibles to build teams and play in tournaments. With this, users act as the general manager to make strategic decisions for their teams, all while earning rewards. NBA Top Shot is another example where users can build teams, participate in challenges, collect highlights, and earn rewards. Finally, games like “FootballCoin,” a browser-based Web3 game, allow users to be the manager of their team using player cards of varying rarity and value to influence strategy and gameplay. Platforms like these engage existing and new fans in innovative ways giving way for athletes and clubs to shape legacies in the digital age.  Read more: David Z Morris - 5 Blockchain Games: What Works and What Doesn't  Web3 games serve as more than a new form of entertainment, it reevaluates how fans interact with sports and athletes. Allowing fans to engage directly with their favorite teams, sports, and athletes, help preserve and enhance how fans think about their favorite athletes in the present, but also as a way to have legacies live on, bringing fans closer to the action and deepening connections they feel to the game.  The role of digital collectibles in shaping the legacy of athletes will be transformative. These new experiences not only redefine how athletes engage with their fans but also democratize access to sports memorabilia and preserve pivotal moments in sporting history. Blockchain-based collectibles and games empower athletes to take control of their digital presence and narrative, offering them a new way to share their stories and connect with fans worldwide. By embracing them, athletes can transcend the boundaries of traditional sports marketing and leave a lasting imprint on the digital landscape.

42417721,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZg7B,1720713600,Why AI's Energy Use Isn't Demonized Like Bitcoin's,"Last month, bitcoin mining company Core Scientific (CORZ) signed a 200 megawatt (MW) artificial intelligence (AI) deal with cloud computing firm CoreWeave, the former agreeing to modify some of its existing infrastructure to host the latter’s GPUs for high performance computing operations.  Miners, bitcoiners, and technologists have been talking about the overlap of AI and Bitcoin for a while and this Core-to-Core deal marked the official collision of these two (potentially) over-hyped and over-frothed industries. The union makes perfect sense: Bitcoin miners have built out robust data centers, complete with attractive energy contracts, and as bitcoin mining trends towards lower profitability, providing AI companies with infrastructure is an obvious and straightforward way to bridge the gap (until things get better).  That said, just like with Bitcoin, not everyone is totally psyched about AI. And AI detractors have valid concerns: bias, transparency, privacy, safety, validity, and (worst of all) stealing my bad art to make even worse art.  But to someone who has at one time or another been in the throes of bitcoin reportage, there’s something very obvious mostly missing from the AI hysteria which was Bitcoin’s political Achilles heel: energy use.  AI, if it is to grow as proponents believe it should, will require a lot more energy to power the data centers which make AI possible. Investment bank Goldman Sachs predicted that data centers will use 8% of the U.S.’s total power supply by 2030 (up from 3% in 2022), of which AI is a strong driving force. Additional research from French energy company Schneider Electric suggests that AI’s share of data center energy demand will rise to 15% -20% by 2028 (up from an estimated 8% in 2023). There are countless other projections and estimates out there and none that I’ve found suggest anything except more.  Now whether this energy demand is “worth it” is a decent question for another day, but why is it that there are mountains and mountains of articles and thought pieces about Bitcoin using an “XYZ-country’s amount of energy” and not for AI?  I have some ideas.  Money, power, respect (the last one is best)  Money: The route of all people.  There are hundreds of billions of investment capital pouring into AI and its speculative future—as a proxy, just look at AI-chip-maker Nvidia (NVDA) which is up 175% this year. Bitcoin didn’t have that when the hype started and even now, near its peak, no one is actively searching for ways to invest hundreds of billions into Bitcoin-related ventures (aside from maybe one of the Bitcoin ETFs).  With all this money flowing in come the big companies: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and with it the power of influence they possess. These four companies are ubiquitous, trillion-dollar giants and masters of PR. How many people hear the word “data center” and think “Oh my, what a waste! All that energy!”? It’s not all too common.  And with all that money and influence comes respect for the big-brained intellectuals in favor of AI. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg say AI is world-changing and good. That comes with cachet. When someone with a wacky X handle tweets that Bitcoin is world-changing and good, that comes with cachet too, but a different kind.  The worst-case scenario is pretty bad  Humans are really good at constructing realities at logical extremes, especially on the bad end. Here’s a bad case for the world with AI: AI gets really good at art and so instead of doing art we give up writing and drawing and painting and we all get to focus on work.  Sounds pretty awful.  But oh, it can get worse. Imagine the AI becomes sentient and it takes over the world and begins “harnessing humans’ heat and electricity as an energy source.” Who has the time to worry about AI’s energy cost when the stakes are so much higher?  As for Bitcoin, the worst case scenario is … what? It collapses and some people you know lose a lot of money? Or maybe it succeeds and topples the Federal Reserve and Bitcoin becomes the world’s reserve currency?  Both scenarios are longshots. In the meantime: Have you seen how much energy Bitcoin uses?  Plus people have more pressing things to worry about. Their livelihoods, for instance.  'This affects me'  If Bitcoin succeeds, then some people get rich and, even though “fix the money, fix the world” is a common bitcoin saying, will our lives really change that much if bitcoin wins?  Meanwhile, the main narrative around AI is that it will … obsolete my job? No thank you, we must stop this at all costs.  Who cares how much energy AI uses? I have bills to pay and I need a job to make money. My only fear is that there won’t be enough of us to stem the tide.  On the other hand, lots of regular people are using AI to make art they share all day on social media, cheat on term papers or generate Wojak memes. No doubt many are using AI for salubrious purposes as well. The point is, AI's utility is obvious to everyday people, mitigating any concern they might have about energy use, in a way that bitcoin's value isn't. (Censorship-resistant payments or hard-to-confiscate assets don't matter until the day you need them, at which point they're the only things that matter.)  AI and Bitcoin: Same, but different  To be sure, there are some who raised the energy use alarm for Bitcoin who are raising the same alarm for AI. I have written articles (and research reports) in defense of Bitcoin’s energy use and, while I won’t write any in defense of AI’s energy use, I am waiting for the day when its vast energy use becomes a main argument against AI.  Though I suspect I’ll be waiting a while, because, whether warranted or not, the relative lack of loud noises around AI’s energy use can be explained swiftly and easily: AI and Bitcoin are different.

This is in a continued effort to make access and user experience easier for newcomers to the space.  The crypto exchange has previously said it plans to turn into a ""super app"".  Jumping in on a continued effort by wallet makers to simplify access and user experience, particularly for newcomers, Coinbase (COIN) is introducing an app that lets users manage all of their on-chain wallets and activities in one place, the company announced Thursday.  The app will allow users to connect multiple wallets and let them buy, swap, send, stake or mint coins from their wallets. Adopters of the app will also be able to interact with each other.  “Today, many people use manual spreadsheets and need to open multiple browser tabs to track their assets holistically,” Coinbase said in a statement. “Many people also manage several crypto wallets, and until now, achieving a comprehensive view of all their assets in one place has been a challenge.”  The app will be available on both desktops and mobile devices and will also work with smart wallets.  Other wallet providers, such as Exodus, have previously launched similar products as the industry tries to welcome less tech-savvy investors to the space. Cold or decentralized wallets, for instance, can be difficult to navigate at times.  For Coinbase, the new app is another step towards the company's long-term goal of becoming a “super app,” similar to China's popular WeChat.

Some $368 million has been attributed to rug pulls, making it the primary target for launching nefarious tokens.  There was a reduction in losses in 2023 and 2024 following a series of hard forks to address the network's vulnerabilities.  BNB Chain retains the dubious honor of ""preferred target for rugpulls,"" according to a report by bug bounty platform Immunefi.  Some $1.64 billion has been lost to hacks and rug pulls on BNB Chain since its inception seven years ago, Immunefi said. Of that, $1.27 billion has been attributed to hacks, with the remainder linked to rug pulls. A rug pull is a type of fraud that involves creating a project with the sole purpose of stealing deposited funds and abandoning the project.  In total, the report assesses 228 rug pull cases that account for $368 million, the largest of which was the $40 million DeFiAI rug pull in November 2022.  In contrast, Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain and the largest smart-contract platform, has racked up losses of $3.6 billion, but just 4.4% of that is due to rug pulls, the report said.  The primary reason BNB Chain is the most common blockchain for rug pulls – a title it's held for more than a year – is developers using forked code, Immunefi said. It also claimed that the BNB Chain community is often lured in by ""quick ways to make money.""  Still, losses dropped last year following the ZhangHeng, Plato and Hertz hard forks, which were aimed at addressing network vulnerabilities. This year saw a further reduction, with just $38 million being lost year-to-date.

42417738,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZk2n,1720712807,DePIN Doesn’t Need New Infrastructure,"The idea of a decentralized internet isn’t new. Projects like Hyphanet and Tor were early attempts to create decentralized networks. More recently, blockchain-based initiatives such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Filecoin have emerged. However, these efforts have faced significant challenges. The primary hurdle has been the need for widespread physical infrastructure - servers, routers, and high-bandwidth connections - to match the robustness and speed of traditional internet service providers.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  What’s often overlooked is the network that we all already have access to, one that could provide the backbone for a massive revolution in how the Web is used and supported all over the globe. Best of all, we needn’t look beyond the devices in our pockets.  The internet today  For the most part, the internet as we know it is built on top of traditional, centralized servers owned by major tech companies. However, in 2024, a new model is emerging.  Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, or DePINs, are blockchain-based data management systems that are alternatives to the existing architecture. Despite their differences, they still provide comparable results for essential services like computing power and real-world information. This is possible because DePIN networks use incentivization, in the form of cryptocurrency compensation, to enable crowd-sourced infrastructure that is as, or more effective, than their legacy counterparts.  Crowdsourced infrastructure isn’t an entirely new concept, but in many cases, there is a limiting factor for just how decentralized these systems are. This is because they often require specific, expensive hardware to be set up and maintained for network participation. This barrier limits how many people or businesses can truly get involved, while also encouraging whales to make centralized farms, ultimately leading to a situation not far removed from what we have now.  Read more: Scott Foo - Welcome to DePIN Summer  The good news is that it doesn’t have to stay this way. Instead of making potential users buy new hardware, what if we utilized the processing power and decentralized infrastructure that most people already carry in their pockets? With such a model, the network would allow anybody to leverage their smartphones or similar devices to assist in running nodes. If built correctly, this could provide more than enough resources for DePIN services to operate, while generating a pool of contribution rewards to continue incentivizing participation and growth.  We already have the devices  In 2023, it was estimated that about 69% of the world’s population already used smartphones to access the internet. This number is expected to grow, with these devices getting more powerful each year. Collectively, they can provide the raw processing power to allow for a new type of content delivery network that powers the information superhighway. Not only does this take control of these services away from major companies, but it also stands to solve issues plaguing the current internet, such as downtime.  APhone demonstrates this concept by transforming any smart device into a Web3 smartphone through a browser-based application. It utilizes Aethir's decentralized cloud technology to provide computational power by distributing processing tasks across a network, allowing users to access increased GPU capabilities, expanded storage, and additional RAM without overburdening their local hardware. This enables any device to function as a virtual smartphone, capable of running resource-intensive applications and storing large amounts of data independently of the physical device's limitations.  DePINs would be almost impossible to take down, as they would be formed by a globally distributed network of nodes and operators. This would mean essential services couldn’t be easily taken offline, centralized, or censored, due to attack or human error, improving data availability for all the apps built on them.  Read more: Max Thake - DePIN: It's Time for Crypto to Get Real  DePINs expand inclusivity. What this means is the barrier to entry would become so low that virtually anyone in the world could get involved. Almost everyone in the world can afford some form of smartphone, and more importantly, they aren’t buying them with an expectation of a return. With this technology, individuals and companies could utilize their spare processing power and be compensated for doing so. Instead of a handful of data giants making all the money from providing services, now that revenue would be much more equitably spread across everyone supporting the network. The infrastructure is already in place, all that needs to happen is a software upgrade.  The future is DePIN  We are right at the beginning of this paradigm shift. Multiple DePIN projects are being developed and will soon gain traction, creating a feedback loop as the benefits of this technology become more widely understood. According to a 2023 report from Messari, the market potential for DePIN stood at an estimated $2.2 trillion last year and is projected to go as high as $3.5 trillion by 2028. There’s every reason to believe this space has sustainable momentum.  In the not-too-distant future, we could see an internet that is decentralized and supported by the very devices we use to access it every day. In that eventuality, all users would see a basic passive income just for being a part of this solution. This could massively overhaul what the internet means for the average person, giving everyone a specific stake in the network while wresting control away from major corporations.  DePIN is a very young new branch of technology. It’s too early to say exactly how its adoption will play out in the coming years. What is important to realize is that so much of the groundwork is already in place. There’s no need to “reinvent the wheel,” so to speak, only to take advantage of what exists right now.  Utilizing the network of smartphones that have permeated cultures all over the globe will allow for a new, equitable, and resilient form of the internet. All that’s needed is the widespread adoption of a software-based solution that taps into crowdsourced infrastructure. It looks like that may be right around the corner.

42417728,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZjsT,1720712542,U.S. House Fails to Override Biden's SEC Veto of Bill That Would End Controversial SEC Guidance,"A U.S. House of Representatives vote on whether to override a veto from President Joe Biden failed on Wednesday, leaving the Securities and Exchange Commission's crypto accounting policy intact.  Rep. Maxine Waters, one of the central Democratic negotiators on crypto legislation, said the SEC and the banking industry are in talks to change the controversial accounting policy.  A strong majority of the U.S. House of Representatives voted against President Joe Biden's defense of the Securities and Exchange Commission's contentious crypto accounting policy, but the turnout fell well short of the two-thirds of the House needed to override the president's recent veto.  Biden had vetoed Congress' earlier bipartisan effort to erase the securities regulator's policy known as Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which 21 Democrats joined a majority of Republicans in supporting in May. The same number of Democrats joined the opposition in a Thursday vote seeking to negate the president's intervention. It had been expected to fall short, but the crypto industry hoped for further proof of widespread support among U.S. lawmakers. Only 228 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill, against 184 nays. One Republican joined the dissent.  SAB 121 advised public companies – most notably banks – that customers' crypto assets in banks should be held on the banks' own balance sheets. That put digital assets in a unique custody category, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said it was an agency reaction to the industry turmoil that saw customers' assets get locked into crypto companies' bankruptcies. But the policy also threatened banks with higher capital demands if they handle customers' cryptocurrency.  The debate over this policy nearly became moot this week, according to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who said the SEC has been negotiating with banking industry representatives about ""targeted modifications"" to the policy and ""may be close to reaching an agreement."" But she noted that ""Republicans are pushing ahead anyway with this blunt and overly broad approach"" that she said would undermine the regulator. ""There is bipartisan agreement in both chambers of Congress that SAB 121 is nothing more than a punitive, anti-digital asset tool deployed by the SEC,"" countered Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, in an emailed statement. ""And there’s clear consensus that the SEC’s view on digital assets is flawed.""  After a Government Accountability Office review found the SEC had erred in treating the policy as guidance rather than as a formal rule, Congress voted to overturn the rule through the Congressional Review Act (CRA), and Biden vetoed.  ""The president ignored bipartisan support in Congress to avoid embarrassment for his rogue SEC chair,"" said Cody Carbone, chief policy officer for the Digital Chamber that represents the crypto industry in Washington.  Biden's defense of the SEC was at least partially based on the scorched-earth outcome of a CRA purge, which won't let the agency consider any similar policies in the future. A statement from the president had said that overturning the policy ""would inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues.""  In May, the House voted 228-182, to overturn the SEC policy. The Senate followed suit, with 11 Democrats joining all the Republicans in seeking to erase SAB 121. In both cases, the Democrats were openly defying Biden's threat to veto the resolution.  On Wednesday, dozens of prominent crypto industry figures met with lawmakers and a White House representative in a roundtable that sought to air some of the differences between the sector and the Biden administration.  Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Biden, ""really seemed to listen and want to understand the concerns that we had,"" Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, told CoinDesk in an interview. He said the industry called for a strong White House signal that it's willing to catch up to Republicans in supporting crypto.

30807512,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629286,1720711857,"Bitcoin Falls Out Of Step With US Equities, What This Could Mean For The Crypto Market","Recent data shows that Bitcoin has completely detached from US stocks. This is significant considering how the flagship crypto and these stocks had a positive correlation before now, which undoubtedly positively impacted Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Bitcoin Has No Correlation With US Stocks Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 has dropped to -0.78 and -0.83, respectively. This means that Bitcoin and these assets have a strong negative correlation, with their prices tending to move in opposite directions. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Sparks Sell-Off Rumors With 11,215 ETH Coinbase Deposit Indeed, that has been the case for a while now, seeing as the flagship crypto has been on a major downtrend for a while now. On the other hand, the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 have continued to enjoy considerable rallies. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 are up over 7% and 4% in the last month, while Bitcoin is down over 15%. A Bloomberg report also highlighted the “collapsing” correlation between Bitcoin and US equities and attributed this decline to the massive selling pressure the flagship crypto is experiencing. Joshua Lim, co-founder of trading firm Arbelos Markets, told Bloomberg that this selling pressure caused by the likes of the German government has “put a cap” on Bitcoin’s upside while these US stocks trade at all-time highs. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that it is indeed this selling pressure that has caused Bitcoin to detach from these US stocks. At the start of June, Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 was at 0.86 and 0.73, respectively. However, this strong positive correlation began to drop just as Bitcoin miners began to offload a significant amount of their holdings. Bitcoinist reported that these miners sold over 30,000 BTC in June. Bitcoin also witnessed increased selling pressure towards the end of June thanks to the German government, which began to offload some of the bitcoins seized from the pirated movie Movie2k. This selling pressure hasn’t slowed, as the German government has continued its selling spree this month. Moment Of Truth For BTC And The Stock Market Bitcoin and US stocks will again be tested when the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data is released on July 11. The much-anticipated report is expected to show that inflation in the country is cooling off, further strengthening the case for interest rate cuts. Such development is undoubtedly bullish for these assets, especially Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

Leo Mindyuk from ML Tech explains what the U.S. Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) Act is and why it matters in Ask an Expert.  – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Navigating Crypto Compliance: A Matter of Trust  Crypto investors must balance staying ahead of opportunities with avoiding the hazards of a volatile market. For investment advisors, the stakes are even higher: They must also safeguard their reputation against skeptical regulators and clients influenced by negative media.  The 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer underscores the importance of a trusted reputation and the vulnerabilities to changing expectations. Advisors should manage perceptions affected by crypto failures like FTX and Celsius, ongoing SEC litigation, and innovations such as Ethereum ETFs, tokenization of real-world assets, and stablecoins.  Figure 1: Slide 29 of the 2024 Edelman Annual Trust Barometer  To protect their brand while serving clients as fiduciaries, advisors can implement these five strategies:  Five Strategies for Protecting Your Trusted Advisor Brand  Align Risk Tolerance, Fees and Compliance Testing  Advisors should align crypto investments with both their and their clients' risk tolerance. Given the breadth of opportunities from meme coins to bitcoin ETFs, advisors should consider waiving fees on digital assets clients favor, but don’t fully trust or understand. Advisors should also adopt a risk management mindset beyond documented risk tolerance questionnaires. Fiduciary strategies include:  2. Test SEC Marketing Rule Compliance  Advisors should prioritize the SEC marketing rule, especially in light of recent risk alerts and AI-washing cases. Advisors should not claim crypto expertise without the requisite skills and experience, and they must avoid letting social media trends drive marketing efforts. The regulatory status of crypto in the US is still evolving. Meanwhile, treat crypto as financial instruments akin to the EU's MiCA standards and adhere to SEC and Finra guidelines. Marketing should:  3. Document a Balanced Investment Process  Until regulatory clarity is achieved, advisors should document consideration of the uncertainty, market volatility and investment basics in minuted investment committee meetings. Drawing from traditional finance experiences with illiquid assets during the 2008 credit crisis, advisors can demonstrate their fiduciary duty even in the face of uncertainty. In 2008, it was unclear how to meet fiduciary obligations for valuation; however, many met these with:  Advisors can adopt similar strategies for crypto asset investments.  4. Implement Best Practices for Service Provider Oversight  To safeguard their reputation when relying on specialized crypto advisors or other service providers, advisors should consider standards from the SEC's proposed rule on Outsourcing. Advisors should understand and document:  5. Monitor for Trust-Impaired Assets  The coming years are crucial for compliance and risk in crypto. While the EU is ahead with MiCA, the US is expected to catch up, indicated by bipartisan passage of FIT21, changing politics and the recent reversal of the Chevron doctrine. Advisors must be operationally resilient to mitigate regulatory uncertainty. Advisors should:  Crypto is revolutionizing investment strategies for advisors just as clients are demanding more to earn their trust. By implementing these strategies, firms and their clients can profit from crypto opportunities without jeopardizing their trusted brand.  - Beth Haddock, managing partner and founder Warburton Advisers  Ask an Expert  Q. What is the U.S. FIT Act?  A. The U.S. Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) Act is designed to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. The goal of the U.S. FIT Act is to clarify the roles of different regulatory bodies, such as the S.E.C. and CFTC, concerning digital assets.  Q. Why does the U.S. FIT Act matter?  A: The uncertainty surrounding the regulatory framework for digital assets confounds market participants and continues to divide regulators and participants. This ongoing ambiguity and absence of clear regulations have negatively impacted the digital assets market. The Act aims to address concerns in numerous critical areas, such as regulatory clarity, consumer rights, taxation and innovation.  Q. Why is the Outcome of the U.S. Election important?  A: The outcome of the upcoming elections will be crucial in determining the future regulatory landscape and the direction of the digital assets market in the U.S. For instance, the composition of Congress can affect which bills, such as the FIT Act, get prioritized. Additionally, political stability and clarity in regulation can affect investor sentiment. Positive developments in legislation can lead to increased investment in digital assets and market growth.  - Leo Mindyuk, CEO, MLTech  Keep Reading  BlackRock's BUIDL token, launched in March, surpassed $500 million market value on Monday, making it the first tokenized treasury product to achieve the milestone.

42417735,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZjyf,1720707016,From Coin-Operated Machines to Token-Operated Gaming,"In 2021, streaming giant Twitch suffered a massive data leak when an anonymous hacker got access to the company’s server and private data, including the platform's source code and payout reports for thousands of streamers.  This incident highlights how even big, well-established platforms struggle to protect sensitive data. It's a stark reminder of the ongoing risks in our digital world, especially for communities that rely heavily on real-time interaction and personal broadcasting. Such breaches put user privacy and financial security at risk, shaking the trust and safety of the entire gaming and streaming community.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's GameFi Week.  To better protect users and their earnings and build a healthier ecosystem where trust and ownership is front and center, the industry needs to continue moving toward a more secure, decentralized, tokenized future.  The hidden threats  Securing the gaming world and building a better ecosystem requires us to take a look at the current market inefficiencies that exist in online gaming. This is especially important as the value of in-game assets—like skins, weapons, and virtual land—experiences massive growth.  One major issue is that games are still controlled by the developers. Currently, Web2 gaming platforms involve three market participants: users, game publishers, and platform (console) facilitators, with the market being tyrannically controlled by the facilitators.  Moreover, games aren’t properly gated, and Web2 platforms face immobility of reputation, where skills and achievements cannot be transferred across different platforms, games, or communities. This, combined with the automation of bots, makes it difficult to manage growing gaming communities sustainably because it’s hard to know who to trust.  Read more: David Z. Morris - 5 Blockchain Games: What Works and What Doesn't  Additionally, games have inefficient value collection, as gamers in Web2 lack a transparent, easy, or native way to ask for returns on the value they generate, with market facilitators and platforms often prioritizing their interests over those of individual gamers.  Play on(chain)  On-chain, decentralized, permissionless messaging apps are on the rise, and are a promising shift towards prioritizing user privacy and security through encrypted communication protocols. These new protocols are designed to empower users, allowing them to own, manage, and drive the games and community, while fully embracing decentralization and the crypto ethos of protecting privacy.  On-chain games that use these new protocols and establish a community-driven governance model, where players actively participate in decision-making and contribute to developing security and privacy policies, provide real ownership and accountability within the gaming community.  A different type of token-operated game  Secure, on-chain platforms play a crucial role in enhancing gaming security. By integrating advanced security measures like end to end encryption and prioritizing community safety by affording mechanisms that enforce reputation, these platforms can significantly mitigate risks. Novel approaches, involving decentralized social platforms with native and transparent experiences to solicit and reward gamers, are setting new standards for security and ownership for communities in the gaming world. These innovations are proving pivotal in creating safer and more meaningful gaming environments.  Read more: What Hamster Kombat Did: How Telegram Built a Web3 Gaming Juggernaut  Furthermore, games should be protocols, decentralized and governed by fee-generating guilds and platforms, with game publishers acting as node operators. This structure allows participants who generate value to find an efficient market price for their contributions and in-game assets.  Additionally, games should be permissionless, with programmable and permissionless game dynamics enabling game creators to build and maintain better communities by enforcing good behavior and granting different entitlements based on users' verifiable actions on-chain.  Finally, saying ‘Yes’ to the transferability of earned loots and assets, though potentially controversial, is no more so than the concept of ride-sharing with strangers in an Uber. Allowing people to trade their hard-earned loot for money can unlock significant value, as blockchain rails create new opportunities where gamers retain more of their rewards and games gain an exciting new dimension of network play.  To protect gamers and their rewards effectively, continuous innovation and collaborative efforts are essential. The future of gaming is being reshaped on-chain, promising secure communication and ironclad security for a safer, more engaging experience.

Other market sentinels that highlight Filecoin’s previous success during optimistic cycles and its endurance during market downturns agree with his points of view. A Potential Digital Storage System Filecoin transcends being a mere digital asset, notwithstanding the positive outcomes of technical analysis. This distributed storage system has the potential to revolutionise data access and storage, addressing the increasing need for safe and efficient data management solutions. The increase in previously unheard-of amounts of data every day makes robust and scalable storage solutions even more crucial. The distributed approach used by Filecoin is a viable remedy for problems like data breaches and censorship that arise with centralised data storage solutions. Price Forecast For Filecoin The Filecoin price is expected to surpass its significant resistance level and potentially reach its upper high of $5.530 in the near future, assuming the market maintains its current momentum. In this month, adverse price action could potentially push the price towards its critical support level of $3.00.

The split will be effected on Aug. 1 and shares will be distributed after the Aug. 7 market close, the company said in a press release. Holders of class A and class B common shares will receive nine additional shares for each share they own.  The company said that the split will make the company's shares ""more accessible to investors and employees.""  The announcement comes after MicroStrategy's share price more than tripled over the past year, hitting an all-time record of over $1,900 in March as BTC rallied past $70,000. The shares rose 6.8% to $1,300 today.  MicroStrategy, led by executive chairman and widely followed bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor, is often viewed as a leveraged play on the price of bitcoin. The company regularly issues corporate debt to raise funds to buy more bitcoin for its treasury. After its latest purchase last month, the company held 226,331 BTC worth over $13 billion.

Among them is financial services firm Swan Bitcoin. Genesis Digital Assets, formerly backed by Sam Bankman-Fried, and two of Northern Data's units were also among firms reportedly planning IPOs.  Ionic is helmed by Matt Prusak, former chief commercial officer of Hut 8 (HUT) and USBTC. Earlier this year, the miner said it would acquire all of Celsius' mining assets as part of the bankrupt lender's emergence from Chapter 11.  The firm said in February that it plans to go public in the next 12 months and expects to achieve 12.7 exahash per second (EH/s), a measure of computing firepower being directly toward mining bitcoin, once its fleets are fully operational this year. At the time, Ionic said the assets include about 87 megawatts (MW) of self-mining capacity, 142MW of hosted bitcoin mining at third-party sites and the Cedarvale site, which is in development to reach a capacity of 240MW.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/11/bitcoin-miner-ionic-digital-hires-cfo-to-shepherd-ipo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f18574841f0388736e71485d4d36180c535d2f2-1082x609.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Given the diversity of DAO structures, a single legislative approach is hard to envisage, it said.  The Law Commission of England and Wales, which reviews and recommends changes to laws to the U.K. government, said it wasn't recommending setting up a new legal framework for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) because they could fall under existing regulations that require companies to have authorization to operate in the U.K.  DAO's could fall under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 if they undertake ""specified activities"" in relation to ""specified investments,"" the independent statutory body wrote in a paper published on Thursday. When governance tokens look like shares, grant voting rights and are issued in exchange for investment into a DAO, then they are regarded as specified investments.  Advertising the tokens may fall under promotion rules that prevent unauthorized companies from reaching out to U.K. customers.  The legal status of DAOs has recently come under scrutiny and courts in the U.S. are already figuring out how to treat them. According to the commission, differences between DAOs mean they may each be subject to different laws, and a unified legislative approach may not be appropriate.  ""We do not, at least at this relatively early stage in the development of DAOs, recommend the development of a bespoke legal framework for DAOs in England and Wales,"" it wrote. ""This is largely because there is no consensus on what a DAO is, how it should be structured, or what a DAO-specific entity could or should look like.""  The public law that applies to a DAO will depend on the type of DAO it is, the report said. Some could be characterized as unincorporated associations, with participants interacting according to the rules set. The people would be liable only for their own actions.  In some cases, a DAO may need to pay corporation tax. An international tax framework for DAOs should be considered, the commission said.  From a litigation perspective, a ""pure"" and completely decentralized DAO could still fall prey to a civil action from a third party, an enforcement action by a regulator or prosecution under criminal law, the report summary said. ""A smart contract can constitute a legal contract,"" the report summary added.  The commission has previously helped draft legislation to digitize documents that paved the way for distributed ledger technology to be used for trade. Earlier this year it sought views on draft legislation that would label crypto as property.  The report also set out that it would be helpful for a body like the Jurisdiction Taskforce, which brings together members of the judiciary, the Law Commission, regulators and other legal professionals, to carry out a fuller analysis of when fiduciary duties might be applied to software developers.

The company is expanding its mining fleet and efficiency, with plans to reach 25.1 EH/s by 2025. Revenue growth, profitability, and stable balance sheet indicate Cipher Mining is undervalued and a good long-term investment. Operator of bitcoin mining logistics, Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) has gained 35.06% (YoY) outpacing the S&P500 at 25.19% (YoY). The stock’s rise was almost half the progress made by Bitcoin (BTC) which shot 89.26% over the past year. Seeking Alpha I believe CIFR presents a good buying opportunity while trading under $5 after announcing the expansion of its mining fleet/ efficiency and its growth-driven projects planned into 2025. Cipher Mining's Overview From an individual perspective, the success of CIFR will be directly proportional to the value of Bitcoin seeing that Cipher operates mining data centers for this crypto. That said, Cipher holds a significant amount of BTC and is growing its reserves or investment profile by the day. As of June 2024, CIFR indicated that it had 2,209 BTC having produced 176 BTC in June alone. In 2022, I wrote on MicroStrategy's ( MSTR ) BTC tracking status as an avenue for the company's success. Since then, MSTR has grown 161.10% with a market value of $15.22 billion as of April 2024. In terms of size and value, CIFR is nowhere near MSTR (which holds at least 214,245 BTC), however, I love the fact that CIFR always has more BTC left every month after clearing its expenses. Cipher Mining June 2024 Update In the Fiscal year 2022, CIFR mined 515 and 377 bitcoins in Q4 2022 (an average of 126 BTC per month). In my view, CIFR's management is practicing considerable prudence in stabilizing its expenses on a monthly and quarterly basis. In June 2024 alone, CIFR separated 73 BTC to cover its operational costs (and save) after mining 176 BTC and selling 103 BTC. In simple terms, CIFR always has some reserve BTC (every month) after paying off its expenses. Expansion Plan is taking shape Further, Cipher’s business mainly involves the development and operation of data centers for mining BTC. The expansion of Bitcoin's critical infrastructure becomes the most vital mission of the company. The number of miners operated by Cipher by February 2023 stood at 58,500 (both direct and indirect) going at a total hashrate of 6.1 EH/s and deploying about 203 MW of power. At the time, the company (and to date) Cipher Mining had 4 data centers or facilities positioned in Texas, i.e. Odessa and Alborz facilities, which have an expansion potential of 165 MW each while Bear and Chief centers have an average expansion potential of about 135 MW. With this in mind, we need to consider the expansion agenda taking shape within CIFR’s administration. While releasing its Q1 2024 results, CIFR stated , and I quote, “ We continue to invest heavily in our expansion, and the early stages of construction at our new Black Pearl data center are well underway. We’ve already cleared and leveled over 50 acres, and we will start laying concrete foundations this month. Because of this progress, and our strong financial position, we have decided to accelerate our plans and build the entire 300 MW data center in 2025. We expect to be at ~9.3 EH/s by the end of Q3 2024, and at least ~25.1 EH/s by the end of 2025.” As stated above, Cipher Mining is now developing the Black Pearl facility- the 5th data center, with the highest expansion potential of 300 MW (within its structures). Other than that, we will see a capacity expansion of the (self-mining) hash rate from the range of 7.7 EH/s- 9.3 EH/s (by Q3 2024) to 25.1 EH/s by 2025. The company had earlier indicated that the Black Pearl facility is expected to be fully energized in 2025 with construction already ongoing. For the Chief and Bear (joint-venture) facilities, Cipher intends to boost the capacity by 30 MW, which will see the self-mining hash rate jump by 1.25 EH/s. I expect the full energization of the facilities by H2 2024. Also, Cipher has increased its mining rigs by 28.21% (YoY) since 2023 from 58,500 to 75,000 showing consistency and enhanced production. I also believe the company will meet its hash rate growth guidance of 40% before the end of 2024. Revenue Growth CIFR’s Q1 2024 revenue stood at $48.1 million, a growth of 119.63% (YoY) from $21.9 million recorded in Q1 2023. CIFR has been strengthening its balance sheet over the years since it posted a paltry $3 million in the quarter ending in December 2022. I am also impressed by the stable profitability status which rose 141.3% (YoY) to $33.3 million and a net income of $39.9 million, an increase of 256.25% (YoY). Seeking Alpha I have also seen that Cipher Mining has been able to leverage the monthly upswing of Bitcoin prices to grow its profitability. In April 2024, it used the BTC’s month-end price estimate of $60,171 to re-sell its power, which also increased to $67,667 in May 2024. The aspect of reselling power helped the company to maintain its revenue despite the impact of Bitcoin halving towards May 2024, which contributed to slowing BTC prices by July 2024. As stated, Cipher has obtained contracts to re-sell power where it offers low-fixed competitive prices and may be positioned to gain with positive changes in the market. This initiative will help the company grow its income in the future. I have also looked at Iris Energy ( IREN ) which like Cipher Mining also has its data centers with its bitcoin farming process using renewable power. In its business update at the beginning of July 2024, IREN indicated that it was focusing on stimulating its monetization programs with “build-to-suit data centers.” I believe the company will actualize its “1,400 MW West Texas project” since it has $425.3 million” in cash, ready for deployment. Risk While Cipher Mining is trading in a profitable territory, its success is tied to the value or price of Bitcoin. A decrease in this value will affect the company's earnings. Cipher Mining uses end-month prices of bitcoin to also determine its power sales, which have decreased 6.35% (month-on-month). Valuation For Cipher Mining, I will use the price-to-book ratio since the company has recorded positive earnings (from its assets) with a positive trajectory pegged on the price of bitcoin. CIFR’s P/B (TTM) ratio stands at 2.23 against the industry average of 3.14 (a difference of -28.98%). The company's total debt is stable at $20.95 million against a cash reserve of $88.68 million, proving that it can pay it off and still invest in capital expenses. Overall, the P/B metric indicates the company is slightly undervalued, and we may see an increase in the long term. Bottom Line My takeaway is that Cipher Mining is a buy since its strategic infrastructural expansion pegged on fleet boost and efficiency will work to grow the company's earnings in the long term. The firm has been augmenting its bitcoin reserves in the past year, and it has maintained a stable balance even after paying its operating costs. CIFR has also managed to maintain a negative net-debt balance (lower than its cash reserves) showing its financial stability.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703493-cipher-mining-stock-push-to-advance-mining-fleet-and-efficiency-will-pay-off?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30801622.jpeg

42417730,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZjuX,1720701900,Exponential.fi Wants to Make It Easier to Invest in DeFi,"Exponential.fi, best known as a crypto risk assessment platform, is launching a new product suite designed to make the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) less daunting for retail traders.  The new platform, which has been available to a small number of beta testers for the past year, aims to serve as a one-stop shop for traders to identify, learn about and invest in crypto opportunities.  According to Driss Benamour, Exponential's CEO and co-founder, the company began two and a half years ago when his other co-founder, Exponential president Mehdi Lebbar, was managing a fund for friends and family and was struggling to move their money into decentralized finance investments.  ""I saw how much pain he was encountering,"" Benamour said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""He was bridging. He had this crazy spreadsheet. He was managing 12 wallets. I was like, 'This is insane.'""  Exponential, which raised $14 million in a 2022 funding round led by prominent crypto venture firm Paradigm, started as a platform that investors could consult to discover DeFi opportunities and assess their risk. The new platform differs from its predecessor in that it will allow users to invest directly from the app.  According to Benamour, Exponential's new platform is ""the safest and easiest way to invest in DeFi with institutional grade security.""  Exponential will continue to emphasize risk assessment, showcasing detailed risk information next to every investment opportunity listed on the platform. It is also designed for retail traders who might not have experience investing in blockchains, so it features a user interface and feature set geared towards a wide audience.  ""In order to truly make it accessible, you have to hit it from all angles, all in one,"" said Benamour. ""It means one-click trading, easy funding with crypto or fiat. It means easy portfolio management. It means easy taxes, and so on and so forth. We built a comprehensive platform so that really anyone could invest in DeFi and access yield.""  ""There is no way today, except Exponential, to send $100 from your bank account and enter a Uniswap pool in less than 24 hours,"" said Benamour. ""That's the magic of what we do.""  Exponential says it is taking a regulation-forward approach and is committed to taking a different path from the ill-fated DeFi yield platforms of old.  Exponential is registered as a money service business with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and requires certain personal information from users to operate.  Like other platforms, it temporarily holds user funds before it invests them on-chain, a step meant to streamline the investment process and remove network gas fees. (Exponential charges its own 20 basis points on every trade). According to Benamour, however, ""everything is also trackable on-chain.

42417739,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZjzh,1720701681,U.S. Inflation Was Negative in June; Bitcoin Jumps Above $59K,"June CPI came in softer than expected.  The odds of imminent Fed rate cuts rose sharply following the news.  Under major pressure of late, the price of bitcoin rose as well.  Inflation continued to retreat in June, according to the government's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Thursday morning, with the June rate coming in at a negative 0.1% pace against forecasts for a gain of 0.1% and May's 0.0% read.  On a year-over-year basis, the CPI was higher by 3.0% versus expectations for 3.1% and 3.3% in May.  Core CPI – which strips out food and energy costs – also was better than hoped, rising 0.1% in June versus expectations for 0.2% and May's 0.2%. Core CPI year-over-year was up 3.3% versus forecasts for 3.4% and June's 3.4%.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} jumped to $59,100 in the minutes following the report, higher by nearly 2% over the past 24 hours.  A check of traditional markets finds U.S. stock index futures on the rise, with the 10-year Treasury yield sliding nine basis points to 4.20%. The price of gold is higher by 1% to $2,404 per ounce.  Ahead of Thursday morning's report, market participants were increasingly coming around to the idea that the U.S. Federal Reserve was going to finally trim its benchmark fed funds rate at its mid-September meeting. The CME FedWatch tool put the odds of this happening at more than 70% versus less than 50% just one month ago. It was a notion that Fed Chair Jerome Powell took pains to neither confirm nor deny in two days of Congressional testimony earlier this week.  At that testimony, Powell did acknowledge a weakening labor market and that the Fed is becoming increasingly focused on downside risks to the economy. However, he reiterated – as he and other Fed members have done for weeks, if not months – that the central bank wants continued confirmation that inflation is returning to its 2% target before rate cuts can be truly considered.  In search of a catalyst  Bitcoin has been under considerable pressure over the past weeks since zooming to an all-time high above $73,500 late in the first quarter. The second quarter saw a slowing of inflows and even on occasion sizable net outflows into the U.S.-based spot ETFs. Then in late June into early July, a flood of supply from the sale of government holdings and the return of Mt. Gox tokens sent the price crashing to below $54,000 at one point, nearly 27% below that record high.  The tumble in bitcoin might be even more frustrating to the bulls given other competing risk assets – namely U.S. stocks – have continued to surge higher throughout the summer. Just yesterday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq completed their seventh consecutive day of advance, scoring new record highs for each index.  Shortly following these latest inflation figures the odds for a September rate cut rose to 87% and the chances for two or more rate cuts by the Fed's November meeting jumped to nearly 50%. Alongside, the U.S. dollar index has slumped nearly 1%, a very sizable move for that gauge. Whether this becomes the catalyst for a fresh run higher for bitcoin remains to be seen.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/11/us-inflation-turned-negative-in-june-bitcoin-jumps-above-59k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce30c5f668be3eaaf3a49a27f10943739c69a19b-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bank reduced its year-to-date net flow estimate to $8 billion from $12 billion.  Bitcoin reserves across exchanges have fallen in the last month due to liquidations by creditors of Mt. Gox and Gemini, and selling by the German government.  Crypto liquidations should abate this month and the market is expected to rebound from August onward, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.  The bank reduced its year-to-date crypto net flow estimate to $8 billion from $12 billion previously.  The Wall Street firm said it was skeptical that the prior estimate of $12 billion would continue for the rest of the year given how high bitcoin {{BTC}} was relative to its production cost or relative to the price of gold, the report said.  “The reduction in the estimated net flow is largely driven by the decline in bitcoin reserves across exchanges over the past month,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  This decline in reserves is likely a reflection of bitcoin liquidations by creditors of Gemini or defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, or selling by the German government, which has been offloading crypto that it seized from criminal activities, the bank said.  The bank’s reduced estimate of $8 billion is comprised of a $14 billion net flow into crypto funds by July 9, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures flows of $5 billion, $5.7 billion of fundraising by crypto venture capital funds year-to-date, minus a $17 billion adjustment to account for the rotation from wallets on exchanges to new spot bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs).

30800828,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629206,1720701045,"XRP Set To Skyrocket 60,000% On Tightest Bollinger Bands Ever: Analyst","In an analysis shared via X and YouTube, crypto analyst Matt “The Great Mattsby” Hughes highlighted what could be a historic move for the XRP price, based on the Bollinger Bands indicator. Hughes points to an impending squeeze in XRP’s monthly Bollinger Bands, suggesting a potential spike similar to previous rallies where the cryptocurrency saw massive gains. Hughes explained via X: “XRP has one of the tightest monthly Bollinger Band squeezes in its history and in all of crypto right now. The last time it squeezed like that, it shot up 60,000%.” In a YouTube video, the crypto analyst went into more detail, explaining how the XRP price has behaved in the past when the Bollinger Bands have been this tight. XRP Could Skyrocket To $250 The first instance, according to Hughes, occurred between September 2016 and March 2017. During this period, the XRP price consolidated for several months, causing the Bollinger Bands to tighten dramatically. After this period of consolidation, the XRP price skyrocketed, achieving gains that Hughes estimates to be around 60,000%. The second time was from December 2020 to April 2021. In this case, XRP rose by around 1,000%. “So it was much less than this period here and simply because it looks like it wasn’t as tight as it was right here [the first time], we can see it was much tighter during the first time,” Hughes explained. Related Reading: Crypto Whales Buy The Dip As $22 Million In XRP Flows Out Of Binance This is the third time. Notably, “is the tightest it has ever been, even tighter than the first time, which suggests that it should explode much higher than previous cycles,” he said. The Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool defined by a set of trendlines two standard deviations (positive and negative) away from a simple moving average (SMA) of a security’s price, but can be adjusted to suit the user’s preferences. A narrowing of these bands typically indicates low volatility with the potential for a major bullish or bearish price movement once the bands begin to widen again. Hughes also examines the duration from the all-time high to the current price, noting that 2,373 days have elapsed. This long period of relative inactivity in price growth, combined with the extreme tightness of the Bollinger Bands, forms the basis of his prediction of an imminent significant move higher. “It’s the tightest in its history as well so that just kind of proves to me that there is going to be a move sometime in the near future. I’m not sure when but sometime, we can see that this is looking more and more like it wants to break out,” Hughes remarked. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash To $0.07 Amid Triangle Breakdown In addition to the technical perspective, he also discussed XRP’s price performance relative to its 20-month moving average. He notes that, similar to previous patterns, XRP has spent a considerable amount of time below this moving average prior to significant rallies. In both previous instances, XRP’s breakout was preceded by a period below this moving average, followed by a breakout that began after testing the bottom of the Bollinger Band. Notably, the price of XRP hasn’t yet tested the bottom of the Bollinger band. Therefore, Hughes speculates about a potential price drop as a “final flush out”, possibly down to the $0.30 area before a potential breakout. Such a move would be in line with previous cycles where a test of the lower Bollinger Band has led to strong rallies. “So there is a possibility that the price could come down to test it. Maybe one last flush out maybe down into the $0.30s, we don’t know but if that’s the case then that’s just more confluence of the previous cycles that price can still just break out,” he concluded. By the way, if history were to repeat itself and XRP were to increase by 62,000%, it would reach a price of $250. At press time, XRP traded at $0.44574.

42417746,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZk8z,1720699383,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Holds $58K Ahead of U.S Inflation Report,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin {{BTC}} held its $58,000 price level throughout the European morning before a U.S. inflation report due at 8:30 ET (12:30 UTC). Following a dip toward $57,000 at about 3:30 UTC, BTC is sitting around $58,400 at the time of writing, down 0.34% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which offers a measurement of the broader digital asset market, has risen around 0.2%, suggesting traders are sitting on their hands waiting for the CPI report, which will offer the latest indication on the prospect of a cut to interest rates.  The U.S. CPI data is expected to show the cost of living rose 0.1% in June after remaining flat in May, leading to a 3.1% rise year over year. If the figure matches estimates, it would confirm more progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target and set the stage for the bank to begin a much-anticipated rate cut cycle this year. Increased prospects of interest-rate cuts will likely bode well for risk assets, including bitcoin, helping the leading cryptocurrency extend its price recovery from the lows seen earlier this month. CoinDesk data show that the recovery has stalled, with buyers struggling to establish a foothold above $59,000.  The amount of ether {{ETH}] staked is nearing a record high as the prospect of a spot ether ETF in the U.S. comes closer to reality. ""The total number of staked ETH has continued to increase and sits near its all-time high as it stands at 33.3 million ETH or 27.7% of the total supply,"" Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant's head of research, wrote in a note shared with CoinDesk. The increasing supply of ether is a sign it has returned to being an inflationary asset, undermining its capability to act as a store of value over time. There are ways to counter this such as staking, which locks ether for a fixed period of time, and burning – or permanently removing from circulation – a portion of the transaction fees paid by users.  Chart of the Day  While bitcoin's price sell-off has stalled, it is yet to clear the downtrend line, characterizing the mini bear market from record highs above $70,000.  A potential breakout could draw in momentum traders.

Cipher Mining has a balanced Bitcoin HODL strategy with 60% production/liquidation rate. Cipher's low power costs translate to low electricity cost per BTC, making it a miner that would maintain profitability post-halving. Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) has been one of the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners that has appealed to me in terms of its competitive energy cost, its strong balance sheet, much less dilution of shares (dilution is typically the par for the course among Bitcoin miners), good cost control, and its well-timed, accretive purchases of hardware. I last covered CIFR in December, following its purchase of 7.1 exahashes of BITMAIN T21 rigs. In addition to the T21 rigs ordered in December, CIFR also ordered 16,700 units of Canaan’s ( CAN ) A1566 miners in January, in a bid to expand its hashrate after the Bitcoin halving event. theminermag.com Another factor that has made CIFR attractive to me is its Bitcoin HODL strategy. Among public mining companies, the company’s HODL portfolio is mid-tier; this is because the company liquidates some of its produced BTC to fund ongoing operations. While total liquidation of produced BTC is an unattractive strategy as this could lead to missing out on future unrealized gains; in my view, keeping every produced Bitcoin in the HODL portfolio while periodically taking on debt could also turn out to be unfavorable for a miner because BTC remains a highly volatile and speculative asset. There are some miners that still opt for 100% liquidation of their produced BTC. Bitdeer ( BTDR ), TeraWulf ( WULF ), and Iris Energy ( IREN ), for example, currently have a 100% BTC production/liquidation rate - meaning they sell all their produced BTC to fund operations or to hold cash instead. Cipher currently has around 60% BTC production/liquidation rate. Cipher is one of the very few miners that has created that delicate balance between its BTC HODL and liquidation. Post Bitcoin halving capacity growth and operations ramp-up has been going as planned for CIFR. Work is progressing well at the Black Pearl data center, according to company reports, and the facility is expected to go online in 2025. All the other data centers - the Odessa Facility, the Alborz Facility, the Bear data center, and the Chief Facility - planned as part of the initial phase or strategy of the company have been fully operational since Q4 last year. I gave CIFR a “buy” rating in December at $3.38. The current stock price $4.37 is about 30% up from that buy rating. This seems to be partly influenced by the generally good performance that tech-related equities have shown in this period. The S&P 500, for instance, is up about 17% since then, and Bitcoin has seen some price gain since December last year (about 39% YTD); although Bitcoin’s rally seems to have stalled momentarily due to the FUD created by the sell-offs by German authorities and the upcoming Mt. Gox claims. When I revisit miner stocks in my portfolio, I re-examine the factors that made the stock attractive in the first instance and see if these factors are still in play. I also perform analyses of forward-looking statements to determine their feasibility in the near or long term, as well as the miner’s financial standing. In this article, I’d look at Cipher Mining’s current attractiveness based on factors I mentioned in the opening of this article. Revisiting Cipher Mining’s Operation Metrics I mentioned that Cipher’s energy cost is attractive compared to most of its peers. Energy cost is a very vital factor for the operational success of any BTC miner, considering that energy cost makes up the bulk of miners’ OpEx. CIFR WULF RIOT BITF CLSK Last reported all-in power cost (kWh) $0.027 kWh (June 2024) $0.042 kWh (June 2024) $0.026 (June 2024) $0.041 (Q1 2024) $0.044 (Q1 2024) The data in the table above was culled from the June production updates of the respective miners. For miners that didn't mention their kWh all-in power cost in their June update, I used data presented in their Q1 CY24 report. Based on my observations, it is not unprecedented for miners to leave out certain metrics, like their all-in power costs, in some monthly updates, as a form of cherry-picking. As we see in the data provided in the table above, CIFR has one of the best all-in power costs and is almost head-to-head with RIOT (a miner that currently leverages ERCOT-backed power privileges ) in this regard. For RIOT, its $0.026 kWh all-in power cost was an average of the cost at the Rockdale and the Corsicana facilities. For Rockdale, it was $0.024 and Corsicana was $0.039. Another competitive advantage for Cipher Mining is that 96% of its all-in power cost power comes at the ~$0.027 industry-low price. This means Cipher currently sees low power costs across its facilities, which translates to an across-the-board reduction in recurring expenses. Cipher’s low all-in power cost also directly translates to low electricity cost per BTC. As of the end of Q1, Cipher’s electricity cost per BTC stood at $23,691, much lower than Riot Platforms' ( RIOT ’) at $31,848, Marathon Digital ( MARA ) $48,183, CLSK’s $29,989, and WULF’s $29,028. Power cost is the largest recurring expense in BTC mining operations, and Cipher’s low power cost further reduced its direct cost to mine per BTC. Cipher’s direct cost to mine BTC as of March (just before the halving) was $27,535, much lower than MARA’s $55,196, RIOT’s $40,704, CLSK’s $36,210, and WULF’s $32,078. Cipher’s energy expertise prompted analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald to assume an “overweight” rating for CIFR last month. I agree with their bullish stance. Post-halving cost to mine (Cantor Fitzgerald) Assuming Cipher’s operational capacity remains constant, the post-halving cost to mine for the miner will be around $44,700. At current BTC price of ~$58,000 that puts Cipher among profitable miners post-halving. Cipher’s orders for more efficient hardware and the timing of these orders means that post-halving total cost to mine will see more decline. In my December coverage, I talked about Cipher’s preorder of BITMAIN’s T21 miners and the prospect it held for the company. Cipher management has, however, amended the T21 purchase agreement to expedite the delivery of rigs, replacing the order of T21s with S21 pros. The S21 pro rigs will be delivered in Q4 this year - this is two quarters earlier than the previously planned delivery of the T21s scheduled for Q2 next year. With this switch to S21 pro, Cipher now expects a self-mining hashrate of 13.5 Eh/s and a fleet efficiency of 18.6 J/Th by year-end - a 35% improvement in efficiency. This opportunistic amendment from T21 to S21 Pro shows Cipher management’s business agility; and in my view, the type of business agility required in a volatile and unpredictable space like Bitcoin mining. The “strategic planning” qualitative factor that initially attracted me to this stock is still in play. With 2,209 BTC in HODL presently, Cipher’s balance sheet remains liquid. Cipher Mining is not overleveraged; Cash and cash equivalent cover total debt. Cipher Mining holds about $96 million in cash and cash equivalents (per Q1 results) and about $130 million in BTC holding at the current BTC price. Cipher’s capital structure remains safe. Risks At current cost to mine per BTC and fleet efficiency, Cipher will remain afloat if BTC trades above ~$45,000. There is inherent risk in this, as macro factors and unforeseen market dynamics could plunge the price of BTC at any given moment. BTC remains highly speculative and volatile. Bottom Line CIFR remains an attractive Bitcoin miner. CIFR is down about 70% from its September 2021 all-time high. The miner’s low power cost and feasible capacity expansion present a post-halving competitive advantage. CIFR remains a solid addition to a Bitcoin stock portfolio post-halving.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703438-cipher-mining-remains-an-attractive-bitcoin-miner-cifr-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30799660.jpeg

Speculative washouts mean a healthier market and a potential for a renewed uptick in bitcoin.  Bull markets are observed to stall during periods of excessive optimism, only to resume after the speculative froth has been cleared.  Capriole Investment's crypto speculation index shows that the speculative excesses prevalent during the first quarter have dissipated, indicating a potential for a renewed bullish price action in bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value.  The speculation index, which measures the percentage of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) with 90-day returns greater than bitcoin, has stabilized below 10%, down significantly from the January high of nearly 60%. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market, hit new record highs above $70,000 in the first quarter and has since cooled to $58,000.  As of this writing, more than 14,800 altcoins exist, according to data source Coingecko. Most of these coins are illiquid and struggle to prove their use cases. Hence, altcoins are generally seen as speculative instruments, with volumes closely tied to Google Trends, an indicator of retail investor interest, and altcoin outperformance relative to BTC is seen as a sign of speculative mania.  Speculative washouts serve as corrective mechanisms, helping realign asset prices with fundamentals and tempering excessive speculation. Thus, they set the stage for a healthier environment in the long run.  That has been the case in the crypto market. Since 2019, a below-10% speculation index has coincided with the beginnings of sharp bitcoin rallies, as observed in the first half of 2019, late 2020, and the second half of 2023.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/11/crypto-speculation-index-slide-suggests-bitcoin-bull-market-reset,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae1f6eeadae965fce155e8dcd34b1bd44ea2c67d-3882x2184.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30797348,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629207,1720695636,"Bitcoin Bullish Momentum Above Bearish Trendline: Is $60,152 Mark Within Reach?","Bitcoin (BTC) after a successful break above its bearish trendline recently has continued to show strong bullish momentum which may mark a significant shift in market sentiment. As the digital asset continues to strive above the bearish trendline, it has stirred up optimism among traders and investors alike as to whether it can sustain its momentum and achieve the $60,152 mark. In this article, BTC’s recent price formation will be analyzed with the help of some technical indicators to ascertain if it could reach the $60,152 mark and what it could mean for the future of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. With a market capitalization of more than $1.1 trillion and a trading volume of more than $24 billion as of the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is currently down by 1.37%, trading at around $58,119 in the last 24 hours. BTC’s market cap and trading volume are currently down by 1.37% and 11.67%, respectively. Bitcoin Bullish Momentum Holds Strong Currently, on the 4-hour chart, the price of BTC is on the rise and attempting a move towards the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the $60,152 mark with strong bullish momentum. Also, it can be noticed that the crypto asset has broken above the 4-hour bearish trend line, made a retest, and began to move upward again. The formation of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator also suggests more bullishness for BTC’s price as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are attempting to cross above the zero line and are heading towards the overbought zone. On the 1-day chart, the price of Bitcoin is experiencing a strong momentum, rising above the bearish trendline and toward the $60,152 mark. It is important to note that BTC’s price started rising after a bearish drop on the previous day. Finally, a careful observation of the 1-day composite trend oscillator reveals that the signal line of the indicator is attempting to cross above the SMA, and both are attempting to move out of the overbought zone. This formation thereby indicates that the crypto asset may be poised for more bullish move. What Could Happen If BTC Reaches The $60,152 Mark? Exploring potential outcomes if Bitcoin reaches the $60,152 mark shows that if the digital asset’s price reaches the $60,152 mark and breaks above it, it may continue to rise to test the $64,515 resistance level. When this level is breached, BTC may experience more price growth toward the $66,736 resistance level and possibly other points above. Conversely, should BTC experience a rejection at the $60,152 mark, it will begin to drop again toward the $53,541 support level. Furthermore, BTC may experience a further price drop to test the $50,604 support level and probably other lower levels, if the $53,541 target is breached.

This covers big buy orders, institutional investors’ savvy purchasing approach, and the expected release of SOL-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

It is common practice to spread out a large buy order over a certain time period in order to lessen the impact it has on the market price. The implication of this is that institutional players are purposefully accumulating SOL without causing big price movements, which is a classic indicative of a long-term positive outlook. ETF Hype Ignites Investor Interest In addition, the announcement that probable SOL-oriented exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might hit the market by the middle of March 2025 is generating curiosity among investors. As a result of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)’s recent submission of proposals to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offered by VanEck and 21Shares, the bitcoin community has been filled with excitement and speculation. Solana Price Forecast A number of analysts are projecting a continuous rise in SOL price; others estimate a 17% gain by August 10th under underlying cautious optimism. Additionally showing a positive trend are technical indicators. Related Reading: Mass Adoption? NEAR Protocol Sees 17 Million Unique Addresses In 30 Days Measuring general market mood, the Fear & Greed Index comes out as “Fear” (29). This implies that although investors are largely hopeful about SOL’s possibilities, certain fundamental issues remain present in the larger crypto industry. The disparity seen in Binance’s trade statistics relative to other exchanges raises some questions. More research is required to find the cause of this varying behaviour as it could points to a distinct market dynamic acting especially on Binance. ETFs’ promise of easily available, regulated SOL investing choices is drawing a fresh generation of investors, especially those previously reluctant to negotiate the complexity of cryptocurrency exchanges. The sustain 8% price rise for SOL in the weekly timeframe reflects this higher demand enabling network to pedal its way back to the $142 field. Fueled by a convergence of favourable circumstances, Solana’s future seems bright. Positive outlook is presented by institutional investor interest, the possibility of regulated ETFs and recent price rise.

The token has seen over $20 million in trading volume in the past 24 hours.  Defending champions Argentina advanced to the finals of the Copa America soccer tournament on Tuesday, more than doubling the market value of the country's fan token, ARG.  According to data source CoinMarketCap, the price of the Argentina Football Association's cryptocurrency has risen 107% to $2.32 since the team's 2-0 victory over Canada, reaching its highest level since May 30, surging over 70% in the past 24 hours alone. Its market value has soared to $27.85 million, the second-highest among soccer fan tokens, but still short of the record $32.4 million reached in the lead-up to the 2022 Qatar World Cup, which it also won.  ARG token is also the most heavily traded of the tokens. As of press time, its 24-hour volume stands at $23.57 million, nearly four times more than the Paris Saint-Germain fan token, which is the largest soccer token by market value.

42417747,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZkA1,1720685452,Staked Ether Close to All-Time High as ETF Approval Nears,"While the supply of ether is rising, the amount that is staked is close to all-time highs, CryptoQuant data shows.  Polymarket bettors are assigning a 90% chance to an ether exchange-traded fund being approved in the U.S. by July 26, but there are still several steps that must take place before one can trade.  As an ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) moves closer to reality in the U.S., the amount of ether staked is nearing a record high, keeping the circulating volume in check even though the total amount of ETH is growing again.  ""The total number of staked ETH has continued to increase and sits near its all-time high as it stands at 33.3 million ETH or 27.7% of the total supply,"" Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant's head of research, wrote in a note shared with CoinDesk.  The increasing supply of the second-largest cryptocurrency is a sign it has returned to being an inflationary asset, undermining its capability to act as a store of value over time. There are ways to counter this such as staking, which locks ether for a fixed period of time, and burning – or permanently removing from circulation – a portion of the transaction fees paid by users.  ""ETH supply is growing again, although slowly. But the narrative of ultra-sound money has ended. The total supply is at its highest level since December 11, 2023,"" Moreno wrote.  Moreno also wrote that spot trading volume data shows ether could be as liquid as bitcon {{BTC}}, with ETH spot trading volume being 80%-90% of that of bitcoin in the last few weeks.  Data from CoinMetrics, meanwhile, shows that around 12% of ether's supply is being used in smart contracts or bridges that connect between blockchains. Between that amount and the tokens that are staked, roughly 40% of the cryptocurrency is ""locked"" and not being actively traded.  Path to the ETH ETF  The race to launch an ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) appears to be heating up, and Polymarket bettors appear to think that they will begin trading before July 26.  Recently, Invesco and Galaxy announced they will charge a 0.25% management fee for their proposed spot ether ETFs, slightly higher than VanEck's 0.20%.  But before trading can begin, the SEC must provide feedback on the current applications, and issuers need to file final amended forms with fee information and other required details.  Over on Kalshi, bettors are giving a 65% chance that ether will outperform bitcoin, but are 95% sure that ether won't hit an all-time high before its larger peer.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/11/staked-ether-close-to-all-time-high-as-etf-approval-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0a664a91664f590f30e4cda1c45ff20fc3d8182-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30790522,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629136,1720684838,Economist Predicts 90% Chance Bitcoin Hits New High By March 2025,"In a forecast issued via X on Friday, Timothy Peterson, a respected network economist and prominent author in the field of crypto analytics, predicted a near-certain rise of the Bitcoin price in the upcoming 8 months. “There’s a 90% chance Bitcoin will reach a new ATH before March 2025,” Peterson proclaimed. Peterson, known for his works including “Metcalfe’s Law as a Model for Bitcoin’s Value,” bases his forecast on the analytical framework detailed in his research paper titled “Lowest Price Forward: Why Bitcoin’s Price is Never Looking Back.” This paper, first published in 2019 and subsequently revised, introduces an innovative approach to understanding the Bitcoin price trajectory by focusing on its historical lowest prices, referred to as the “Never Look Back Price” (NLB). This NLB marks the last instance Bitcoin was traded at a particular price point, after which it never declined to that level again. Related Reading: 8 Reasons Why The Bitcoin Bear Phase Is Just A ‘Boogeyman’: Fund Manager The methodology Peterson employs involves plotting these NLB data points on a lognormal scale adjusted by what he calls a “square root time” scale. This unconventional metric facilitates a deeper insight into the long-term growth patterns of Bitcoin, comparing them effectively with the diffusion processes observed in technology adoption across other domains. Bitcoin Adoption Is Key Central to Peterson’s analysis is Metcalfe’s Law, which he elaborates as “the value of the network is proportional to the square of the number of its users.” By applying this principle to Bitcoin, Peterson posits that as the digital currency’s user base expands, its intrinsic value is expected to increase exponentially. The paper details the use of a “square root time” model to align traditional time-value money concepts with the non-linear growth rates typical in network economics, presenting a compelling case for Bitcoin’s future valuation trajectories. Peterson’s approach notably incorporates elements of conservative financial analysis by emphasizing the lowest historical prices of Bitcoin. “By focusing on the lowest price, the analysis inherently adopts a conservative stance, underestimating rather than overestimating value,” Peterson notes, which helps in “minimizing the risk of overvaluation and ensures that predictions do not overly rely on optimistic scenarios which might not materialize.” Related Reading: Drake Loses Bitcoin Bet Following Canada’s Copa America Exit, ARG Fan Token Soars 40% In his paper, Peterson also addresses potential anomalies and market manipulations, which can distort price perceptions. By focusing on the NLB, the analysis filters out such distortions, offering a purer view of Bitcoin’s value appreciation unaffected by short-term speculative pressures or external shocks such as the COVID-induced market anomalies of 2021. The prediction of a new all-time high before March 2025 reflects a broader sentiment of confidence in the sustained growth of the Bitcoin network by Peterson. As adoption curves continue to rise and network effects further entrench the value of Bitcoin, the forecast is not merely speculative but grounded in quantifiable and observed historical trends. Peterson concludes, “As long as adoption continues, Bitcoin’s value — represented by its NLB price — will go up. If adoption is hindered, then the price will stagnate or drop.” At press time, BTC traded at $58,192.

42407877,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7EFI,1720680412,"Bitcoin Waits for Guidance From U.S. Inflation Data, Bond Market","Thursday's U.S. CPI updated is expected to offer evidence of continued progress on the inflation front, boosting the Fed rate cut probability.  Increased prospects of Fed rate cuts could bode well for BTC's recovery.  BTC bulls should watch out for a potential ""steepening"" of the Treasury yield curve.  With the supply overhang from Germany's Saxony state nearly cleared, Thursday's release of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report will be pivotal in determining the bitcoin {{BTC}} market's trajectory.  The data due at 12:30 UTC (8:30 ET) is expected to show the cost of living in the world's largest economy rose 0.1% month over month in June after remaining flat in May, leading to a 3.1% rise year over year, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The core CPI, which strips out more volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have increased 0.2% from May and 3.4% since June last year.  If the actual figure matches estimates, it would confirm continued progress toward the Federal Reserve's (Fed) 2% inflation target and set the stage for the bank to begin the much-anticipated rate cut cycle this year.  Increased prospects of rate cuts will likely bode well for risk assets, including bitcoin, helping the leading cryptocurrency extend its price recovery from the July 5 lows of around $53,500. CoinDesk data show that the recovery has stalled, with buyers struggling to establish a foothold above the $59,000 mark.  ""CPI data will be closely watched, with markets expected to react significantly to this release. Analysts' optimistic outlook for late 2024 and 2025 hinges on the FOMC reducing policy rates, as lower rates typically increase liquidity, driving investors towards 'longer-tail' assets like cryptocurrencies,"" algorithmic trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk in an email.  The inflation rate has slowed dramatically from the high of 9.1% in 2022. Still, in recent months, the Fed has reiterated the need to see further progress on the inflation front before pulling the plug on elevated interest rates. On Tuesday, Fed chief Jerome Powell said the same in his testimony to Congress, while stressing the bank won't wait for inflation to cool to 2% to cut rates.  According to the CME's FedWatch tool, since Friday's weak payrolls report, traders have priced about a 70% chance of a Fed rate cut in September and see a rising probability of another cut in December.  Focus on bonds  The U.S. Treasury yield curve's response to the expected soft CPI release might influence the broader market sentiment, including bitcoin.  Slower inflation and increased rate cut bets can boost prices for the two-year note, sending its yield lower. That's because when investors foresee lower interest rates, they are willing to pay a premium for a security with a higher yield in the present. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year note will likely stay elevated as markets fear bigger budget deficits under the potential Trump presidency. Republican candidate Donald Trump's odds of winning the Nov. 4 elections have recently increased.  The net effect will be a so-called bull steepening of the yield curve, represented by the spread between yields on the 10- and two-year notes. The curve has been inverted, with two-year notes consistently offering a relatively higher yield since mid-2022.  According to the CAIA Association, periods of bull steepening, characterizing a fast normalization of an inverted yield curve, have historically occurred during periods of economic contraction and coincided with risk aversion.  ""Typical bull-steepening periods were: 1990-1992, 2001, 2003, 2008 and 2020, and all were recessionary periods,"" CAIA said in an explainer.  ""Equities typically do not fare well during this type of regime, and their performance during these times clearly lags the overall historical average,"" CAIA added.  Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, made a similar observation in the July 4 edition, saying, ""a sharp steepening has always preceded the beginning of a recession.""  Acheson added that the curve has recently steepened somewhat due to lingering political uncertainty in the U.S. ""It also makes a Trump victory more likely in the interim, which implies a possible inflation uptick driven by tariffs and a flood of issuance to fund the promised tax cuts,"" Acheson explained.  Investment banks like JPMorgan and Citi are betting on the steepening of the yield curve.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/11/bitcoin-waits-for-guidance-from-us-inflation-data-bond-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ba35e597ea1852de6abca6d12ee52d4fb5b91a4-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin’s volatility remains elevated at 3.9 and 4.6 times that of gold and global equities, respectively. But bitcoin’s volatility has consistently declined alongside the industry’s maturation in recent years. While bitcoin’s volatility is high in absolute terms, it’s in the same realm as many familiar investments, like certain mega cap tech stocks such as Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta. Investors considering a bitcoin allocation should take a measured approach that not only considers the potential upside that could come from investing in bitcoin but also its volatility and risks. Small allocations, regular rebalancing, and dollar cost averaging may help smooth out the ride. By Jay Jacobs Decoding Bitcoin's Volatility Bitcoin has become a globally recognized asset since its emergence 15 years ago. Regarded as the first global digital payment method to gain broad global adoption, Bitcoin is a global monetary instrument that can be transferred directly between two people anywhere in the world, in near real-time. From 2014 to 2023, bitcoin was the best performing asset and held the top annual spot seven of those 10 years. But bitcoin was also the worst-performing asset in the other three years, demonstrating both the highs and lows of this asset. Over that time period, bitcoin still averaged a 50% annualized return through these ups and downs, outperforming every major asset class by a wide margin. Figure 1: Bitcoin has had periods of high performance and periods of significant drawdowns Caption: Table: Bitcoin performance compared with other select major asset classes Source: Bloomberg and BIackRock calculations, as of Apr. 30, 2024.

For actual fund performance, please visit iShares® ETFs by BlackRock - Investing Made Easy | iShares - BlackRock or Investment Management & Financial Services | BlackRock . Bitcoin's volatility - meaning its tendency to have big swings both up and down - as well as its frequent and prolonged drawdowns 1 , present risks and challenges to many investors. Since 2014, bitcoin has experienced four drawdowns in excess of 50%. While one of these was followed by a quick, six-month recovery, the three largest drawdowns averaged an approximately 80% decline. Patient investors were ultimately rewarded in each case, but in three of the four major corrections, bitcoin's price took nearly three years to recover. Figure 2: Bitcoin's history of big drawdowns and rebounds Caption: Table featuring Bitcoin's historical drawdowns, including start dates, days until market bottom, days until market recovery, drawdown percentages, and 4-year forward returns, where the latter calculates the cumulative total return assuming Bitcoin was held continuously for four years starting from the initiation of each drawdown period. Source: Bloomberg Bitcoin Spot Price. Drawdowns calculated from daily returns. 4Yr Forward Return calculates the cumulative total return if bitcoin was held four years beginning at the start of each drawdown. Dashes in the 4Yr Forward Return column indicate that four years have not yet passed since the beginning of that drawdown. Past performance is not indicative of future results. With a history of such extreme outcomes, relatively small allocations to bitcoin and regular rebalancing may help investors stay the course throughout market stress. And while past performance is no guarantee of future returns, it is important to recognize that bitcoin may continue to exhibit volatility in the future. Bitcoin's Volatility Then & Now Bitcoin only came online 15 years ago. Such nascency breeds price volatility as market participants speculate about the role bitcoin may play in the global economy and in portfolios. This is similar to how a newly formed company is typically perceived as a riskier investment than a firmly established one. But as time has passed and bitcoin has continued to solidify its global presence, its volatility has notably declined. While bitcoin is still much more volatile than other major asset classes, like equities and bonds, Figure 3 illustrates the steady decline in the volatility of the world's largest digital asset. 2 Figure 3: Bitcoin's volatility is still high, but coming down Rolling 1-year volatility Chart description: Line chart depicting the rolling 1-year volatility of Bitcoin alongside gold, global equities, and U.S. bonds, illustrating Bitcoin's historically high but decreasing volatility relative to other major asset classes from December 2017 to April 2024.

And while bitcoin is often associated with its immense volatility, it's actually not an outlier when compared to certain mega cap tech stocks, like Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta, for example.

Bitcoin's Volatility And Overall Portfolio Risk Arguably more important than bitcoin's standalone volatility is the impact it will have on a portfolio's overall volatility. Because bitcoin has been relatively uncorrelated to traditional assets like stocks and bonds over long time horizons, the way that it has behaved in a portfolio is unique. In fact, a bitcoin allocation may actually have a smaller impact on portfolio volatility than similar-sized positions in certain individual stocks. With large allocations, bitcoin's standalone volatility can have an outsized impact on portfolio risk. But at more modest sizes, bitcoin's typically low correlation has tended to provide modest diversifying effects while tapping into a novel source of return. Still, investors must be aware of bitcoin's immense volatility and should be prepared to weather long and potentially painful drawdowns. That's why we believe anyone considering investing in bitcoin should understand their time horizon, risk tolerance, and have clear investment objectives. Investors can also navigate near-term volatility by using common portfolio management methods such as dollar cost averaging, regular rebalancing, and maintaining a long-term investment horizon. © 2024 BlackRock, Inc.

Singapore-based trading firm Presto Labs is suggesting clients bet on bitcoin {{BTC}} strength and against bitcoin cash (BCH) in a market-neutral trade to profit from the ongoing Mt. Gox repayments.  Hundreds of millions worth of BTC hit the market last week as defunct exchange Mt. Gox finally began its long awaited repayments to creditors impacted in a 2014 hack. Over $73 million worth of BCH is set to be distributed to traders in the coming months, compared to $9 billion worth of BTC.  “The Mt. Gox’s Rehabilitation Trustee plans to distribute multi-billion dollars worth of BTCs and BCHs between July 1st and October 31st, 2024,” Presto market analysts led by Peter Chung told CoinDesk in a note Wednesday. “This can create a shift in supply/demand dynamics in BTC and BCH during this 4-month period, potentially opening up a pair trading opportunity.  Pair trading is a trading strategy that involves buying and selling two financial assets simultaneously to profit from their relative price movements.  “Our analysis shows that the selling pressure for BCH will be four times larger than for BTC - i.e. 24% of the daily trading value for BCH vs. 6% of the daily trading value for BTC. Long BTC perpetuals paired with short BCH perpetuals is the most efficient market-neutral way to express this view, barring funding rate risk,” Chung added.  CoinGecko data shows over $27 billion worth of BTC exchanged hands in the past 24 hours, compared to $180 million of BCH.  Presto further assumes that investors who held bitcoin at its earlier stages are likely to be “diamond-handed wealthy Bitcoiners,” and thus more likely to hold part of their repayments instead of selling the asset outright.  However, “100% will be the “much weaker investor base” of BCH could see 100% sold in the near term, Presto said.",POSITIVE,BCH,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/11/long-bitcoin-and-short-bitcoin-cash-to-benefit-from-mt-gox-repayments-trader,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af5533562893e00a029eaace0996b96eacade301-1905x1072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lawyers for the estate say this claim is invalid because the loan was never initiated.  The FTX bankruptcy estate is pushing back against a claim by Jump Trading's subsidiary Tai Ho Shan, which asserts that Alameda didn't deliver 800 million Serum (SRM) tokens and wants $264 million in damages, but Alameda says that the claim is invalid because the loan never commenced.  SRM was the native token of the decentralized exchange (DEX) Serum. Jump Trading announced in the fall of 2020 that it had made a significant investment in Serum and would provide market making services.  The DEX collapsed after FTX went bankrupt in November 2022, and at the time, insiders told CoinDesk that the exchange was decentralized in name only as orders came from FTX.  Market data shows that the 800 million SRM tokens would account for approximately 80% of the roughly 1 billion SRM in existence and more than the 372.7 million current circulating supply.  The token was scheduled to have a max supply of over 10.1 billion tokens, but this was cut short due to its demise in 2022.  In court documents, Jump Trading argued that the FTX-Alameda estate owes it more than $264 million in damages based on an options model.  The options model uses the market price of SRM on the bankruptcy filing date, the repayment option price, SRM's implied volatility, and the interest rate on the loan, among other factors.  In its heyday, SRM was once one of the shining stars in the constellation of coins backed by Sam Bankman-Fried's former FTX-Alameda, and partners.  SRM peaked at just over $12.50 in September 2021, with $1.2 billion in trading volume, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  Its nearly unprecedented surge in 2021 minted millionaires at the exchange, which eventually annoyed Bankman-Fried, according to the book Going Infinite, because he feared these newly wealthy employees weren't interested in long hours.  Now, market data shows that SRM is worth approximately 3 cents.  In court documents, the FTX-Alameda bankruptcy estate argued that the loan agreement was never fulfilled because Alameda did not deliver the SRM tokens as specified.  ""It is undisputed that Alameda failed to deliver the cryptocurrency contemplated by the Loan Confirmation to the Master Loan Agreement. The loan therefore did not commence,"" lawyers for the FTX-Alameda estate wrote. ""The Master Loan Agreement gives Tai Mo Shan one remedy when a loan does not commence: voiding the applicable Loan Confirmation.""  The estate challenged the valuation amount presented by Jump, arguing that Tai Mo Shan's damages calculation is ""wholly unsupportable"" and based on a flawed ""options model"" though it did not provide an explanation or documentation to support this.  Lawyers for FTX estate also alleged that Tai Mo Shan might have engaged in fraudulent transfers.  ""For the reasons stated here and more following discovery, Tai Mo Shan may be liable to the Debtors for fraudulent transfers,"" court filings read. ""The debtors submit that Tai Mo Shan may have been the recipient of certain constructively fraudulent transfers...including the purported loan at issue here.""  The lawyers also argue that the Master Loan Agreement and Loan Confirmation provide that Tai Mo Shan would receive 800 million SRM tokens for no fee and no interest, which is questionable.  ""There are no contract provisions specifying any amount of collateral or consideration given by Tai Mo Shan in return for the alleged loan,"" they write.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/11/jump-trading-drags-ftx-estate-to-court-over-264m-serum-token-loan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d09bf61d42cb597ce901322802ec3f7ea0c3697-640x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Reserves On The Brink Of Exhaustion The selling spree began last month when the German government initiated the sale of seized Bitcoin from a wallet operated by the country’s Federal Criminal Police Office, commonly known as the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA). Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Sparks Sell-Off Rumors With 11,215 ETH Coinbase Deposit The BKA sold 900 BTC in June valued at around $52 million at the time, which were part of a massive haul seized from a now-defunct movie piracy website. Subsequently, the government sold an additional 3,000 BTC worth approximately $172 million, followed by another sale of 2,739 BTC, equivalent to $155 million this week. Adding to these figures, the latest data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham reveals that the German government’s wallet sold over 5,000 BTC on Wednesday, leaving just 15,552 BTC in its stash worth around $892 million, representing a sell-off of more than 80% of their entire stash of 50,000 BTC seized. Price Remains Steady As BlackRock Steps In Despite the significant sell-off, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its price above the crucial 6-month support level of $50,000, signaling resilience in the face of the massive selling pressure witnessed in the market over the past 30 days. Furthermore, the recent pullback from all-time high levels has been viewed by many investors, including institutional asset managers, as a buying opportunity, contributing to the slight recovery in Bitcoin prices over the past few days. Akrham even stated in a social media post, “The German government is selling, but Blackrock is buying. Related Reading: Chainlink Traders Capitulate After 10% Plunge: Bottom Here? Recent data shows that on Wednesday, the Bitcoin ETF market activity has seen a net addition of 4,862 BTC valued at $281 million, mitigating the impact of the daily sell-off by the German authorities. BlackRock for instance, one of the largest ETF issuer by assets under management, increased its BTC holdings today by 2,095 BTC (worth $121.16 million), bringing its total holdings to 312,565 BTC worth $18.08 billion, playing a significant role in stabilizing and supporting the Bitcoin price. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $57,430, almost unchanged from Tuesday’s price with a slight drop of 0.4% in the last 24 hours.

The next major support is at $0.4310 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4204 swing low to the $0.4430 high.

30781508,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628988,1720670443,"Bitcoin Forms Double Top Pattern On 4-Hour Chart, Analyst Reveals Targets","The Bitcoin recovery has not been as impactful as expected, failing to break $60,000 even after a return of bullish momentum. Given this, expectations of a bearish reversal have become the norm as analysts do not believe that the pioneer cryptocurrency has enough steam to sustain the current momentum. One of the analysts who believe the price is destined for a downturn is Finn Oakes, who predicts a return to the $53,000 territory. Bitcoin Forms Double Top Pattern In the analysis that was shared on the TradingView website, crypto analyst Finn Oakes explains that the Bitcoin price has now formed a double top. This occurred after the Bitcoin price crossed the $59,000 level two times and both times, the price had failed to successfully clear this level. Related Reading: XRP Price: Crypto Analyst Identifies ‘Point Of Control’ That Could See A Repeat Of 2017 This double top pattern is shown on the 4-hour hour chart, where there is a reversal pattern forming as a result of this. This double top is bearish for the price and could signal a continuation of the downtrend that began last week. In such a case, the bulls have a hard fight ahead of them. Breaking down the double top, the crypto analyst explains that it has now shown $59,000 to be a strong resistance zone. This means for any rally to occur, the price would successfully have to beat this resistance before it is confirmed. In contrast to the resistance level, $56,000 has now emerged as support for the Bitcoin price. This gives both bulls and bears a tight $3,000 room to fight for dominance and push the price either way. Otherwise, sideways movement could continue. Target For The Decline Given the formation of the double top on the 4-hour chart, the crypto analyst expects the price to drop once again. For the first scenario, where the Bitcoin price breaks below the $56,000 support, the crypto analyst expects a downtrend to the $53,000 level. However, it doesn’t exactly end there if the downtrend is not stopped. In this case, the chart shows the price falling below the $53,000 level and moving toward $52,000. Although, this seems to be a worst case scenario as opposed to an expected target. Related Reading: Crypto Whales Buy The Dip As $22 Million In XRP Flows Out Of Binance Furthermore, with the rising volume during the downtrend, the analyst believes this indicates that there is more selling going on in the background, something that could contribute to the price decline. “The trading volume has increased during recent down days, indicating strong selling pressure. This reinforces the current downtrend,” Oakes said. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is struggling to hold the $58,000 level. However, it is still seeing 1.08% gains in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Goldman Sachs Aims To Capitalize On Tokenization Trend According to a Fortune report, Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, revealed the bank’s intentions to expand its crypto offerings, focusing on the tokenization sector. Tokenization involves issuing “real-world assets,” such as money market funds and real estate holdings on public blockchains such as Ethereum or Solana, leading the bank to plan to launch three tokenization projects by the end of the year in partnership with major clients, including its first project in the United States. Related Reading: Floki Inu To Build Schools In India, FLOKI Price Seen Hitting $17 While other financial institutions, such as BlackRock, launched its first tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain in March, McDermott emphasized that success depends on creating products that investors want. To that end, Goldman Sachs recently hosted a digital asset summit in London attended by more than 500 clients. During the Summit, McDermott emphasized the importance of providing investors with these solutions that can “fundamentally” change asset management strategies, stating, “There’s no point in doing it just for the sake of it. According to the report, Goldman Sachs’ views on crypto differ within the institution. McDermott acknowledged that varying perspectives are expected within an institution of their size. While Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, CIO for Goldman Sachs, voiced skepticism about crypto as an investment asset class, McDermott emphasized the bank’s active involvement in crypto from an institutional perspective, including trading cash-settled crypto derivatives on behalf of clients and their participation in the recently approved ETF markets. Crypto Opportunities Ahead Of US Presidential Election As BlackRock successfully launched its treasury fund, BUIDL, on the Ethereum blockchain, it has garnered significant attention; McDermott noted that Goldman Sachs primarily targets institutional clients and intends to work exclusively with private blockchains due to “regulatory constraints.” Although McDermott refrained from disclosing specific details about the upcoming tokenization projects set to debut this year, he revealed that one project would focus on the US fund complex. At the same time, another would center around debt issuance in Europe. Related Reading: Ethereum Rising, 2 Million Addresses Will Be In Money If $3,200 Is Broken Looking ahead, with the US presidential election and the potential for a shift in the government’s regulatory stance on crypto on the horizon, McDermott believes that Goldman Sachs’ opportunities in the space could expand further. This could include activities like holding spot crypto assets and exploring execution and sub-custody services, subject to approval. As of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market, Bitcoin (BTC), was trading at $57,580, presenting a slight decrease of 0.5% in the 24-hour time frame, aiming to consolidate above this level.

BTC is moving lower and now at risk of more downsides toward the $56,000 level. Bitcoin started another decline from the $59,475 resistance zone. The price is trading above $57,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $57,900 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might start another major decline if it fails to stay above the $57,200 support. Bitcoin Price Faces Trouble Bitcoin price extended its recovery wave above the $57,500 level. BTC even climbed above the $58,500 level. However, the bears are active near the $59,500 resistance zone. A high was formed at $59,474 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $58,500 level. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $54,955 swing low to the $59,474 high.

A close above the $60,000 resistance might start a steady increase and send the price higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $62,500 resistance. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to climb above the $58,400 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $57,200 level. The first major support is $56,000 and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $54,955 swing low to the $59,474 high. The next support is now near $55,000. Any more losses might send the price toward the $53,500 support zone in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.

Solana-Based Token Skyrockets 350% Following Messi and Ronaldinho’s Promotion Bitcoin Bet Lost: Did The ‘Drake Curse’ Do It Again? On Monday, Drake shared on Instagram that he had bet against the Argentina National Football Team. Ahead of the match, the rapper placed a $300,000 bet in Bitcoin that the Canada National Football Team would defeat the World Cup champions 1-2. Drake also teased the Argentine fans, saying, “This could get Messi.” If realized, the Canadian rapper would have received a $2,880,000 payout in Bitcoin. Canada reached the semifinals after beating the tournament’s revelation, the Venezuela National Football Team, in penalties. Meanwhile, the current World Cup champions also beat Ecuador in penalty shootouts. Drake’s bet resulted in a loss after Argentina knocked Canada out of the Copa America. Following the victory, the AFA social media accounts took a jab at the rapper using Kendrick Lamar’s diss track ‘Not Like Us.’ Nonetheless, this is not Drake’s first rodeo with Bitcoin bets. Football watchers and the crypto community joked that the ‘Drake Curse’ continues after the loss. The Canadian rapper has a track record of losing hundreds of thousands with his sports bets and ‘cursing’ the teams the shows support.

The token also exhibited a 35.6% price decline from the previous month. After Argentina beat Canada, the fan token’s daily trading activity skyrocketed 227%, reaching a trading volume of $5.2 million. Before the match, ARG’s trading volume was around $1.4 million, according to CoinGecko data. On Wednesday morning, ARG surged 41%, briefly hitting the $1.6 mark before retracing. As of this writing, the token hovers between the $1.55-$1.59 price range. The recent performance represents a 35.7% and 120% increase in the weekly and yearly timeframes.

Furthermore, the meme cryptocurrency recently encountered rejection due to fresh bearish pressure. This occurred as the cryptocurrency attempted to recover some of the losses it had sustained last week. According to various social media posts by whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts, there have been multiple instances of large Dogecoin transfers in and out of exchanges during this price decline, with the latter being prevalent and contributing to the decline. Notable among these transfers is the transfer of 108.5 million DOGE tokens into Robinhood DOGE Price In Trouble Transaction details from the blockchain show that the 109 million DOGE tokens were transferred from a private address “DF8jRK” to “DHQsfy,” an address linked to the American retail crypto platform Robinhood. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash: Here’s What The Data Says About Buying The Dip At the time of transfer, the tokens were collectively worth $11.58 million, making it one of the largest Dogecoin transactions in 30 days. Consequently, the transfer to Robinhood, a major crypto exchange, suggests the whale may be preparing to sell their DOGE holdings, which could drive the price down. 🚨 108,572,027 #DOGE (11,580,883 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Robinhoodhttps://t.co/rKRBitf8Qy — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 8, 2024 Generally speaking, whale transfers into cryptocurrency exchanges like this one contribute to a pessimistic sentiment among retail investors. It is interesting to note that a thorough examination of the data on the blockchain reveals that this is not the first time that the unnamed whale address has moved massive amounts of Dogecoin tokens to Robinhood in what appears to be selloffs. As reported by NewsBTC, a similar transaction occurred in October 2023, when 71.2 million DOGE tokens were dumped into Robinhood by address “DF8jRK.” What’s Next For Dogecoin? This latest sell-off on Robinhood is just the latest setback for the popular meme cryptocurrency, which has been experiencing a challenging stretch. Over the past month alone, DOGE has shed around 25% of its value, bottoming out below $0.10 for the first time since February. Consequently, the meme cryptocurrency has lost a sizeable chunk of the gains it had accumulated during the first half of the year, when it peaked at $0.22. Related Reading: 83% Of All Bitcoin Holders Still In Profit Despite Drop Below $60,000 At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.108 and is still in an active sell-off in the broader cryptocurrency market. According to average cost data from IntoTheBlock, Dogecoin bulls would need to slice through many resistance points around $0.109, $0.113, $0.117, and $0.1209 before regaining full bullish momentum from retail investors. This requirement for bullish momentum was also reaffirmed by Crypto Daily Trade Signals, which pointed out that the price of DOGE must stabilize above $0.1080 and $0.1150 to be considered bullish.
