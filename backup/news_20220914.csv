The prominent crypto trader shared some charts on a Twitter Thread this Monday. Dave claims that the world&apos;s foremost cryptocurrency is about to flip bullish, judging from previous cycles. The pseudonymous crypto analyst took to Twitter to share MACD charts that prove his predictions with over 100,000 followers. According to the Tweet, Bitcoin has hit its bottom and is ready to start its journey upward once again. Dave is basing his predictions on the past years&apos; trends depicted on the chart (2012, 2015, and 2019).

42411731,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXUT,1663192489,What Are Doodles? Everything You Need to Know About the Colorful NFT Project,"Project name: Doodles  Project type: PFP (profile picture)  Original mint date: October 17, 2021  Original mint price: .123 ETH (approximately $300 at the time)  Runs on: Ethereum  Highest sale to date: Doodle #6914 sold for 296.69 ETH (approximately $1.1 million at the time) on January 7, 2022  What are Doodles?  Doodles began as a collection of 10,000 non-fungible tokens (NFT) made up of colorful artwork by Burnt Toast, the alias of Canada-based artist Scott Martin. The project was originally dreamed up by Martin and former Dapper Labs employees Evan Keast and Jordan Castro.  The hand-drawn pastel imagery is made up of playful characters wearing animal costumes, bright jewelry, sunglasses and more. There are also non-human characters – like pickles, cats, skeletons and apes – dispersed throughout the collection. These attributes have been mixed and matched to create over 100 rarity traits that influence their popularity and price on the secondary market, similar to other collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club.  Where can I buy Doodles?  Primary NFT sales took place on the Doodles website. Doodles can now be purchased on many secondary marketplaces, including OpenSea, Nifty Gateway and LooksRare.  What is the project’s utility?  According to the team, the project is “community-driven” and was launched to “bring joy to everyone who sees them.” The brand has since expanded beyond the initial 10,000 NFTs and has released new NFT collections, orchestrated elaborate live events and sold merchandise through its website. Most of these additional benefits are exclusive to Doodle holders.  Holders also have power over the Doodles Community Treasury, aka the Doodlebank, where they can vote for experiences, activations and campaigns that benefit the community. Users can also submit preliminary proposals that are voted on by the community before being implemented by the team. Half of the 5% royalty taken by OpenSea secondary sales revenues is also deposited into the community treasury. According to the project, the money is used “to scale our team and begin experimenting to grow the Doodles brand.”  Offshoot projects  Earlier this year, Doodles released a free companion NFT collection for existing holders called Space Doodles. Each Doodle from the original collection was given the opportunity to launch its own personal spaceship “generated from over 200 audio-visual traits and on-chain stats.” The project uses “wrapped NFTs” – a “non-dilutive” solution where the original NFT is stored in a digital vault and a smart contract is used to produce a Space Doodle. This means that a Doodle owner can only hold a Doodle or a Space Doodle at one time and that the project did not introduce more NFTs into the circulating supply. Users can unwrap their Space Doodle at any time to retrieve their original Doodle NFT.  According to the team, Space Doodles and accompanying on-chain stats (like, for example, the NFT’s piloting ability and mechanical knowledge) will be used in future Doodles experiences and is a component of the brand’s expanding “universe.”  What do we know about the Doodles team?  Scott Martin, the artistic force behind the project, is an illustrator, designer, animator and muralist. He told Fortune in January 2022 that his focus is on “making good art and reaching a large audience.” Before Doodles, he produced art for brands including Google, Skillshare, Dropbox and Adobe.  Evan Keast, aka “Tulip,” is the face of the project’s branding. He previously worked for Dapper Labs and led marketing for the popular blockchain game CryptoKitties.  Jordan Castro, who goes by the alias “Poopie,” specializes in product and worked alongside Keast at Dapper Labs as the product lead for CryptoKitties.  In May 2022, the team added former Billboard President Julian Holguin as partner and CEO to “lean into music, gaming, premium content and consumer goods.”  In June 2022, the brand brought on the musician and producer Pharrell as the project’s chief brand officer to produce “music projects, produce animated film & TV and creative direct product launches,” the project tweeted.  What intellectual property (IP) rights do holders have?  The Doodles name and intellectual property are owned by Doodles, LLC. According to the Doodles Terms of Service, they also own the rights “surrounding the images, names, logos, 3D layer files, trademarks, the website, the ability to mint 3D or voxel or other versions of Doodles, the look and feel of the user interface, the smart contract code or anything else not specifically granted by any following licenses.”  Doodle holders can use their NFT as a PFP, sell it or merchandise it for up to $100,000 through the sale of physical goods (though after reaching the $100K milestone, they need to work with the Doodles team on official licensing terms). Holders can also use the full Doodle in a piece of art they create but would need to discuss larger licensing deals with the company.  The company says it is “open” to holders utilizing Doodles in various commercial ways. However, a Doodle can only be used in its “fullness only” and holders cannot mint new NFTs that are considered to be derivatives of their character.  For example, a group of Doodles NFT holders proposed a derivative project called Noodles to the community in November 2021. The food-based project, inspired by Burnt Toast's art style, was the first officially approved derivative venture through the Doodlebank.  Doodles future plans  Following its Genesis Factory event at NFT.NYC in June 2022, the project laid out its goals for expansion, including music, events and attractions, gaming, animation, IP partnerships and consumer products.  During this time, it teased plans for its “Doodles 2” project in the form of a colorful animated video, hinting at a “mass market, identity-focused” offshoot of its original project. According to the brand, the new project will allow anyone to mint a “base-level Doodle'' and “choose generic traits like skin tone and hair color.” Doodles 2 can then be customized with wearables featuring “varying tiers of rarity.” The NFTs will be “dynamic” and the images will be available as “full body or PFP.”  Doodles 2 is connected to its Genesis Box NFT release, which was offered as a “bucket auction” to existing holders. In the bucket auction, users submitted a bid in ether (ETH) for the amount they were willing to pay for one of the NFTs, similar to a blind auction bid. At the conclusion of the auction period, the Doodles team determined a number known as the clearing price, which is the minimum bid that would win an NFT. There was a total supply of 24,000 “boxes” that featured apparel and accessories for Doodles 2. According to the company, the “rare” boxes “will be used to seed the initial “economy of wearables” and will never be sold again.  The brand also released its “Dooplicators,” a free-to-claim NFT for existing holders with “perpetual utility,” which the brand describes as a “super-powered device that will allow collectors to bring the rarest OG traits into Doodles 2.”  The project is also releasing a music collection executive produced by Pharrell in partnership with Columbia Records titled “Doodles Records: Volume 1.” The project will feature original music and hand-drawn album art from Burnt Toast, alongside wearables for Doodles 2.

42421438,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMPt,1663191849,Ethereum Mainstay Hudson Jameson on What Makes the Merge Monumental,"Today is a special day for Ethereum. I want to elaborate on why I am personally super-excited and why it is so monumental. The Merge represents a pinnacle of collaboration and engineering mastery across dozens of teams and hundreds of people.  The transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake is in Ethereum’s blood, with plans to change the consensus algorithm discussed since before Ethereum’s launch. Over the years there have been many iterations of what Ethereum’s proof-of-stake will look like. Where we are today is a culmination of those efforts and why so many are celebrating The Merge.  Hudson Jameson is an active Ethereum community member, founder of the Ethereum Cat Herders group and former Ethereum Foundation employee. A version of this post originally published on Twitter.  An overlooked part of The Merge is Ethereum’s unique approach to a multi-client ecosystem. This means that there are multiple blockchain clients from different teams in different programming languages that minimize the possibility of the entire blockchain halting if a bug is found in one or more clients.  This is in contrast with nearly every other cryptocurrency out there that would be in big trouble if a chain-stopping exploit was found in their singular client.  Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake is like changing the engine of a moving car, where the car is the execution layer (EL) that processes the data and transactions and the engine is the consensus layer (CL) that determines how the transactions are built into blocks to make the chain. Because of this, Ethereum has execution clients (currently a choice of four) and consensus clients (currently a choice of five) that can be mixed and matched to enable security of the chain.  Every client is built by a different organization/team and only one of the clients is built by a team embedded in the Ethereum Foundation, which speaks to the decentralized nature of development on Ethereum.  By exploring Ethereum-related GitHub repositories and ethresear.ch posts you can see the amount of time spent coordinating all of these teams to coalesce under one specification and vision for Ethereum’s future.  See also: Monitoring the Merge: What a Successful Ethereum Upgrade Looks Like  I believe in Ethereum because it has a soul. It has a community that believes in the tenants of decentralization and censorship resistance of the blockchain.  The generalized programmability of Ethereum allows for many different people from various walks of life to join to contribute to their idea for a decentralized application.  On top of all of that, Ethereum builders don’t take themselves too seriously and have a fun time while changing the world. The Merge is a day for celebration for all of Ethereum and especially the builders who got us to where we are today.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,Hudson Jameson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/14/ethereum-mainstay-hudson-jameson-on-what-makes-the-merge-monumental,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60e639c61660494c1d1a59b9da72dff9681b27e6-2133x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chicago Crypto Capital (or CCC) owner Brian Amoah and salesmen Darcas Oliver Young and Elbert Elliott sold cryptos called BXY tokens to 100 investors, many of whom had no prior crypto experience, from August 2018 to September 2019, according to the complaint.

Hoping to raise capital and create a strong user base, Beaxy sold investors on a token that it said could generate initial coin offering (ICO)-era high gains. It had an agreement with CCC to sell them as well. CCC pocketed 3 cents of every 5 cent sale, the complaint said.  CCC sold BXY to inexperienced investors without informing them of the company’s kickbacks, the complaint said. CCC later neglected to deliver BXY tokens to some of their buyers.  The SEC accused the group of acting as unregistered brokers and fraudsters in violation of U.S. securities law. It is seeking to bar them from offering crypto securities.  The case is the latest action by an investment regulator that has pledged to crack down on alleged wrongdoing in crypto.

42416247,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PucIlL,1663188802,Market Wrap: Ether Trades Relatively Flat Ahead of Ethereum Merge,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether traded flat for much of Wednesday amid the final countdown to the much-anticipated Ethereum Merge.  Both BTC and ETH traded in a narrow price range.  Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell 1% on moderate volume in comparison to its 20-day moving average. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization declined below the psychologically important $20,000 mark. BTC is down 58% year to date and approximately 70% below its all-time high of $68,721.93  Ether (ETH) prices rose 1.4% also on moderate volume as the Ethereum blockchain Merge approached. The Merge will shift Ethereum’s protocol from a proof-of-work consensus to proof-of-stake at some point Wednesday night. ETH prices are down 57% year to date, and 67% below its all-time high of $4,847.57.  Economic Calendar: The producer price index for August fell on both an annual and month-to-month basis. Annual PPI declined to 8.7% versus expectations of 8.9%, while monthly PPI showed a 0.1% decrease in prices versus expectations of a 0.1% increase.  PPI represents wholesale prices and can signal the direction in which retail prices (captured in CPI data) are headed. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, registered higher than forecast on both a manual and monthly basis however.  Overseas, annual inflation data for the United Kingdom showed a larger-than-expected decline to 9.9% versus a forecast of 10.6%  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities traded flat, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 up 0.1%, 0.7%, and 0.3%, respectively.  Commodities: Crude oil prices rose 1.7%, with natural gas prices accelerating 10%. Copper futures declined 1%, while traditional safe haven asset gold fell 0.7%  The Dollar Index (DXY) rose 0.1%, showing a -0.85 correlation coefficient to BTC. The correlation coefficient ranges from 1 to -1, with 1 implying a direct relationship while the latter represents a completely inverse relationship.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index to measure the performance across a basket of currencies, was up 0.68%.  Latest Prices  ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,958 −1.5%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,597 −0.7%        ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): $1,007 −0.9%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,946.01 +0.3%        ● Gold: $1,705 per troy ounce +0.0%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.41% −0.01        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  ETH takes center stage on a historically significant day.  After years of anticipation, multiple testnets and hours of coverage, the Ethereum Merge is finally here. The prevailing thought is that the blockchain’s conversion from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism will occur without a hitch.  Still, all eyes will likely be monitoring the Merge and evaluating its degree of success.  On a technical basis, ETH is trading relatively neutral Wednesday. Prices are 0.77% above Tuesday’s close, ending three consecutive days of declines.  Daily volume is relatively in line with average volume over the 20 most recent trading days, which doesn’t indicate significant conviction either to the long or the short side.  ETH’s Average True Range (ATR) is down and has been trending downward all year. The ATR measures an asset’s range of price movement over time and gauges overall volatility.  Despite what often feels like a whirlwind of price movement, ETH’s volatility has narrowed leading into the Merge. Investors should note, however, that historically, diminishing volatility has not always trended in a straight line. ATR spikes in February, May and June were noticeable and could certainly be repeated.  The Volume Profile Visible Range tool, which identifies trading activity at varying price levels, shows ETH settled between two ranges of low trading activity. The significance of this trend is that prices can often move rapidly through these “low volume nodes,” resulting in the spikes in volatility mentioned above.  The next “high volume node” to the upside for ETH is near $2,700, while the next high volume node to the downside rests at approximately $1,140. Traders are likely awaiting the results of today’s Merge, and that the success (or lack thereof) will send prices ETH sharply in one direction or the other, at least in the short term.  Traders looking to derivatives data for insight will likely focus on the spike in open interest for ETH puts at the $1,550 strike price, along with the spike in call options purchased at the $1,750 strike.  Options open interest by strike gives an indication of traders’s anticipated price direction, with calls representing the right (but not the obligation) to buy and puts representing the right to sell an asset.

42416236,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PucHrz,1663188093,Bitcoin After the Ethereum Merge: Experts Weigh In,"Ethereum, the blockchain behind ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and worth almost $200 billion, will attempt to do what no major blockchain has ever done – switch consensus mechanisms (how computers agree on the state of a network) from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. What impact will this transition, referred to as “the Merge,” have on the dominant cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC)?  According to some experts, not much.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  The biggest impact will naturally be felt by Ethereum itself. The first and most critical step is for Ethereum to successfully execute the Merge. If the Merge fails, it would be catastrophic for the Ethereum community. However, this negative outcome is highly unlikely due to the extensive amount of testing the network has undergone over the past months.  Conversely, the immediate impact of the Merge on Bitcoin will probably be minimal. As for ether in relation to bitcoin, most experts seem to agree that any resultant price movementswill likely be transient. After all, Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake has been on the network’s to-do list from inception.  Read more: 3 Big Things the Merge will Change About Ethereum  “Proof-of-stake … was a very important thing that was discussed since the very beginning and now it's being carried out. … It's been a long time coming,” said Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio in an interview on CoinDesk’s “First Mover” show.  So it’s reasonable to assume the ripple effect of the Merge has already been (at least partially) factored into market prices.  “Certainty has started to increase that this Merge is actually going to happen … so every day you're pricing it in a little bit more,” said Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a Bitcoin-focused development shop and affiliate of the Stacks Foundation.  Read more: The Final Countdown to the Ethereum Merge Has Officially Begun  The 'Flippening'  Many have suggested Ethereum will someday surpass Bitcoin in market capitalization, an event playfully coined “the Flippening.” Will the Merge trigger that hypothetical changing of the guard?  Miller doesn’t believe an impending flippening is at hand.  “I think bitcoin has established itself as the core asset. I believe in a multi-chain world. [But] I think bitcoin is the digital gold. It is the store of value. I'm pretty skeptical overall of the flippening happening,” Miller said, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Christopher Calicott, managing director at Trammell Venture Partners, a bitcoin-focused venture capital firm, had similar sentiments.  “It is my market view that bitcoin is the internet’s base monetary layer. Despite any market drawdown posed by Merge-related risks, bitcoin will emerge unscathed,” Calicott told CoinDesk.  Joe Orsini, vice president of research at Eagle Brook Advisors, also believes bitcoin will remain the dominant store of value in the long term, despite a temporary performance bump in ether’s post-Merge price.  “Ethereum can, of course, outperform in the near term, but ultimately the opportunity set that bitcoin has as that alternative store of value is certainly higher,” Orsini said during a CoinDesk interview.  Others believe the flippening can be measured by a variety of metrics other than market capitalization; for example, Bitcoin currently has around 15,000 nodes (computers in a blockchain network) while Ethereum has roughly 9,500 nodes. However, Ethereum has higher transaction volume (currently over 1 million daily transactions) compared with Bitcoin (approximately 270,000 daily transactions). Other metrics such as active addresses and number of projects built on top of a network could also be appropriate ways to measure dominance.  “In many ways Ethereum is already the dominant cryptocurrency [because] 70% of tokens are built on Ethereum. If the Merge is successful, it will encourage even more upgrades to Ethereum and that should put it in a strong position to also be the dominant currency in market-cap terms,” Niclas Sandström, CEO of investment firm Hilbert Group, told CoinDesk.  Despite diverse views on whether the Merge marks the beginning of Ethereum’s dominance, few predict an immediate overthrow of Bitcoin, with many taking a wait-and-see approach. Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Trading, said bitcoin will continue as crypto’s “preferred hedging instrument” until further notice. (Genesis Trading is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  The fate of proof-of-work  A successful Merge will validate proof-of-stake in the eyes of many. Will Bitcoin and other power-consuming proof-of-work blockchains slowly fade into obscurity?  “Proof-of-work is the most proven in terms of network security and decentralization. The jury is still out on the long-term viability of proof-of-stake and to what extent it will be centralized versus decentralized,” Sandström told CoinDesk.  As Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital asset group at Ninepoint Partners noted on CoinDesk TV Wednesday, “Bitcoin’s hashrate is hitting an all-time high. To me, it reveals a stark choice right [involving] this simple, secure coin that’s probably going to be around forever. And then the Ethereum thing is more of like a fantastic growth story that has lots of potential but much more – many more – risks, in my view.”  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Edges to All-Time High  I think that the contrast is kind of poetic that this is happening as we move with Ethereum to proof-of-stake, and Bitcoin is simultaneously becoming its most secure ever.  Another key issue surrounding the Merge is the fate of Ethereum’s proof-of-work forks (groups that choose to remain on a proof-of-work version of Ethereum). Will they capture a significant chunk of Ethereum’s market share or will they become irrelevant?  “I just don't think at the end of the day that there's going to be enough support for [Ethereum] proof-of-work anymore,” Di Iorio told CoinDesk.  He should know. He had a front row seat when Ethereum Classic (whose token is ETC) split off from the main Ethereum chain after the infamous DAO hack triggered a contentious hard fork in 2016. Indeed, Ethereum Classic has mostly floundered since then and currently sits at roughly $5 billion market capitalization, approximately 2.5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization.  Read more: 'Will ETH Survive?': Why Ethereum's Leaders Forked the Network in 2016  Whether Ethereum proof-of-work forks survive remains to be seen. As for Bitcoin, most thought leaders agree it will maintain proof-of-work consensus indefinitely and won’t be dramatically impacted by the Merge.  “The Merge is the biggest thing that has happened in a long time. How it’ll affect Bitcoin is unclear. We’ll just have to wait and see,” said Di Iorio.

42416243,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PucHIl,1663187919,Judge Approves Use of Independent Examiner in Crypto Lender Celsius' Bankruptcy Case,"A federal judge has granted a motion for the U.S. Trustee's office to appoint an independent examiner to investigate crypto lender Celsius Network’s financial management that led the firm to file for bankruptcy earlier this summer.  U.S. bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn ruled on Wednesday that the scope of the independent examiner would include an examination of several areas, including Celsius' crypto holdings, why there was a change in account offerings from the Earn Program to the Custody Service for some customers while others were placed in a “Withhold Account,” Celsius' procedures for paying various taxes and the current status of the utility obligations of Celsius’ mining business.  Celsius has laid out a proposal by which a still-being-built mining enterprise will allow it to generate enough revenue to continue operating.  Last week, Celsius and a group of its creditors agreed that an independent government examiner should investigate the firm as it moves through its bankruptcy proceedings. In August, the U.S. Trustee’s office, a Department of Justice entity tasked with monitoring bankruptcies, filed to appoint an independent examiner to investigate the company, saying its leadership had not been transparent about the actual financials.  Read more: FTC Moves to Join Crypto Lender Celsius’ Bankruptcy Case  While some of Celsius' borrowers opposed the move, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors and attorneys for Celsius said in separate filings that they had agreed to the appointment, so long as the examiner's scope was narrowed to limit the cost and time of the investigation. The U.S. Trustee's office agreed to these limitations as well, the committee's filing said.  According to the judge's ruling on Wednesday, once an examiner is approved, he or she will have seven business days to propose a work plan and a budget. The court will then have seven days to approve the plan and budget, and the examiner will then have 60 days to file their report.  Celsius initiated bankruptcy proceedings earlier this summer after freezing users withdrawals on its platform in June due to “extreme market conditions.” Trouble began for the firm when spooked retail investors rushed to withdraw their assets from Celsius’ platform, precipitating a bank run-like situation at the exchange, following May’s crash of Terra and its LUNA token, which plunged bitcoin to a third of its previous all-time high value of almost $69,000.  In its bankruptcy filings, Celsius revealed it owes $4.7 billion to its users. Since then, some 58,000 custody account holders, who lost a combined $150 million, have organized to hold the firm to account and recover their lost assets.

Bitcoin (BTC) was in a choppy trading range around $20,000 while ether (ETH) changed hands just above $1,500.  Stocks and cryptocurrencies sank Tuesday after August’s U.S. consumer price index showed that inflation remains hot. But there hasn't been much follow-through on the downside.  Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital asset group at alternative investment manager Ninepoint Partners, said bitcoin still looks bright in the long term.  “Bitcoin's simplicity is maybe its biggest drawback because it can't be programmed to do lots of different things, but it's also the greatest asset, in my opinion,” Tapscott told CoinDesk in a video interview. “I think[of bitcoin] as a simple, immutable, highly secure store of value that is completely decentralized and almost impossible to capture by any single force, whether it's a government or company.”  As Ethereum’s Merge approaches, Tapscott said he has a bullish outlook on ether that “has lots of potential but many more risks.”  “I think that the contrast is kind of poetic that this is happening as we move with Ethereum to proof-of-stake, and Bitcoin is simultaneously becoming its most secure ever,” he said.  ETH rose 2.4% in the past seven days but was down 17% over the past 30 days and remains well off its 30-day high of $1,951.  Crypto market watchers are eyeing the Merge, which is expected to reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by 99%. A Bank of America research report last week said this could attract more institutional investors who were barred from buying tokens that run on blockchains that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus system.  “If you're a big company and you're planning on investing millions of dollars in Web3 opportunities, whatever those might be, you want to know that the technology you're building on is going to be consistent over time,” Tapscott said. “Ethereum is clearly the leader of smart contracting platforms through a community-driven effort. And if all of a sudden there's a deluge of big companies [that] are building on this new platform, you might think that seems like a pretty good investment opportunity.”  Oanda Senior Market Analyst Craig Erlam said in a note Wednesday that some suggest the Merge may have contributed to the rebound in ether's price.

42394739,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVQMi,1663183942,Crypto Giant FTX Eyes Raising Money to Fund Acquisitions: Source,"Cryptocurrency exchange FTX is raising capital in parallel with a potential acquisition, according to a person familiar with the matter.  It’s evaluating several possible takeover candidates, some of which are companies operating retail-trading platforms, the person said. Negotiations are in preliminary stages. If acquisition talks fall through, it’s less likely FTX will raise money, according to the person.  FTX is seeking the same $32 billion valuation it was assigned the last time it raised money early this year if it does a capital raise, the person said. That stands out given the subsequent rout in crypto prices; FTX rival Coinbase (COIN) has seen its stock plummet about 70% this year.  A spokesperson for FTX declined to comment. FTX.US President Brett Harrison has previously said the exchange was on the lookout for potential acquisitions.  FTX co-founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried already has a tie to retail trading, personally purchasing a 7.6% stake in Robinhood (HOOD), the brokerage. Robinhood's stock price rose to the highs of the day after the CoinDesk story was published.  A takeover of a company focused on retail investors would likely bring an influx of new users to FTX, which has mostly served sophisticated traders and professionals. It has already taken steps into retail, launching its own equities trading product, FTX Stocks, earlier this year for customers in the U.S.  Read more: Binance, FTX Among Crypto Players in Hunt to Buy Voyager Digital Assets as Coinbase Backs Out: Sources  UPDATE (Sept. 14, 2022, at 20:16 UTC): Adds Robinhood's stock price reaction.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,"Tracy Wang, Ian Allison",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/14/crypto-giant-ftx-eyes-raising-money-to-fund-acquisitions-source,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a23baf11318142e8f5a75fbf4f66f5f72b1f13a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Bitcoin maximalist, executive chairman of MicroStrategy and alleged tax evader said Wednesday in a letter that mining is “the most efficient, cleanest industrial use of electricity.” He said that Bitcoin’s mechanism is 100 times greater in its output cost than its input.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  Estimates place the annual energy consumption of Bitcoin on par with that of a small country. But proponents of the original cryptocurrency and its energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism argue that much of the burn comes from green sources, like wind and solar.  In the PoW model, miners race against each other to add new blocks to the chain. But other popular blockchains are eschewing PoW. Ethereum’s pending Merge upgrade to a proof-of-stake consensus system is intended to significantly reduce those environmental concerns.  In Saylor’s telling, it's not so simple. He argued that “dedicated energy” powering these devices will move to “generic computers,” redistributing efficiency that would not limit carbon emissions. Saylor has previously pledged to defend Bitcoin against energy critics as a founding member of the Bitcoin Mining Council.

Graham added that a large portion of Chinese miners, whether based abroad or in China, are “still heavily involved” in mining.  Read more: Ethereum Merge Explained: What Investors Should Know About the Shift to Proof-of-Stake  In May 2021, Chinese government officials banned bitcoin (BTC) mining. However, as CoinDesk previously reported, the country’s mining industry is very much alive.  Graham said it will also “be very telling to see how much influence [miners] still have on our industry” when it comes to Ethereum, the second-biggest blockchain after Bitcoin, and its long-expected changeover this week.  The Merge is the blockchain’s transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a faster and less energy-hungry proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. The change is expected to take place during the early hours of Thursday, Sept. 15.  Read more: Ethereum Proof-of-Work Fork Timing Posted  While some miners are expected to support a version of the current proof-of-work mechanism through a hard fork after the Merge, Graham said sees “no rationale for why that project should exist.”  “It doesn’t really make sense to me, but it will be telling in that one specific way,” Graham said, referring to Chinese miner Chandler Guo. Guo said he planned to fork Ethereum to maintain a proof-of-work version. Guo is hoping to attract the Ethereum miners the new PoS blockchain will leave behind because the new system will not require a miner's computing power to validate transactions on the chain.  Graham called the Merge a “seminal moment” in “the history of our industry,” and should be appreciated despite vigorous competition within the industry.  “It's an enormous credit to Vitalik [Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder] and all the developers and everyone in the Ethereum community,” Graham said.

42411093,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC0Pf,1663175122,A Peculiar Flavor of NFTs Is Thriving in China – One Regulators Can Abide,"In April 2021, China hosted what cryptocurrency and art media outlets heralded as the world’s first “major” crypto art exhibit.  At the opening, the gallery in 798, Beijing’s trendy art district, was buzzing with excited guests, including a Financial Times reporter who walked around an exhibition space densely packed with LCD screens showing the crème de la crème of non-fungible token (NFT) art: Beeples and CryptoPunks, among others. The show did so well it got an extended run in Shanghai.  To many, it felt like China, despite its complicated relationship with cryptocurrency, could at least be a hub for NFT art.  About a month after the opening, Chinese regulators outlawed crypto trading and mining once again, rattling the NFT community. In the months that followed, however, NFTs were considered to be somewhat safe from regulation because they weren’t yet clearly classified as potentially risky financial instruments. It became hard to find a crypto company, or bro, in China that wasn’t starting an NFT hustle.  Today, something has changed. The exhibition’s two curators say they are still hopeful about China’s ecosystem for NFTs, but both are looking for new opportunities away from the country.  “Great creator artists, they will come to like the real Web3 because it is what they really stand for and there also is a global market,” explained Qinwen Wang, China community leader at blockchain project Polkadot and one of the curators of last year’s “Virtual Niche: Have you ever seen a meme in the mirror?” exhibition.  Wang is currently in Los Angeles, learning about the U.S. market. She plans to permanently relocate to New York, where she wants to act as a bridge between the East and West.  The fact that she has moved to the U.S. is indicative of a wider shift that has taken place in China: NFTs remain alive and well in the country by several measures, but they are not what you’d expect. They might look like the low-resolution, funkily clothed avatars seen in freewheeling international markets, but in China there are fundamental differences.  They exist in a regulatory gray area, without clear and comprehensive laws. NFTs are not banned in China, but they can’t be bought with crypto and can’t be used as a speculative investment, as traders often do elsewhere in the world.  The view of Chinese authorities is shown in the very name: They are called “digital collectibles,” not NFTs. Big Chinese tech firms Ant Group and Tencent changed the NFT references on their sites to “digital collectibles” in October, likely a move to distance the products from their global crypto counterparts.  Rather than open networks that anyone can use, such as the Ethereum blockchain, in China the collectibles are built primarily on permissioned blockchains amendable only by authorized parties. This gives companies and the authorities greater control over the content. Rather than startups like OpenSea, several Chinese NFT auctioning platforms are built by well-established Web2 tech firms. The government and corporations are trying to curb the “financialization” of NFTs, meaning stop the popular speculative investment that took place during the last crypto bubble.  “There will be legislation passed to prohibit the use of this kind of technology to build any kind of regulated financial services,” said Yifan He, CEO of blockchain development firm Red Date Technology.  Like much of China’s regulation, such as its Great Firewall that blocks certain parts of the internet, this model attempts to rein in aspects of the technology that are deemed undesirable to its authoritarian regime. More than an experiment, China’s model could become a blueprint for other regulators in the region and globally. Already, Singapore’s central bank, for example, has started parroting some of Beijing’s language about crypto speculation.  Read more: Singapore's Central Bank Wants to Foster Digital Assets, Restrict Crypto Speculation  Legal trading  China’s legal market in “digital collectibles” is booming: Metaverse-focused information platform Gyroscope Finance estimates that as of June, 681 NFT trading platforms exist in China and that since March, 100 new platforms have been set up each month. But, all in all, “NFTs in China [are] not developed under the premise of a free market. It’s more like digital art, which is easy to buy but is hard to sell,” said Peng Chi, a visual artist from China who has used the technology for his work.  BlockCreateArt’s co-founder, Sun Bohan, quoted data from Lead Leopard Research, which found that about 4.56 million NFTs worth $150 million were sold in China in 2021.  On Weibo, China’s Twitter equivalent, the hashtag #digitalcollectibles has been viewed over 350 million times. Others, related to specific NFT drops or memes, have received widespread attention.  However, the platforms usually don’t allow NFTs to be resold for at least a set period of time, to curb retail traders from “speculating” – a word Chinese regulators often use as a reprimand against the crypto market overall. Crypto, which has been banned in the country as a transaction method, can’t be used to buy NFTs.  “China is quite interested in the NFT market, but will only support the NFT market under the Chinese system, the federated chain system and the digital RMB [yuan] system,” said Sun, who initiated and curated the April 2021 exhibition as co-founder of Beijing-based Block Create Art (BCA).  “NFT projects derived in this context [without crypto] will still evolve around these centralized guidance directions and cannot be called a pure and complete NFT market,” said Sun, who, like co-curator Wang, is currently in the U.S. to open a Web3 gallery in Los Angeles and connect his business with the North America and Southeast Asian markets.  Black market JPEGs  In addition to regional NFT marketplaces, many Chinese citizens have access to marketplaces like OpenSea and Magic Eden by using virtual private networks (VPN), which can bypass China’s internet firewall blocking content deemed unsavory by censors.  It’s estimated that 31% of internet users in China have some type of access to a VPN, and among these users NFT trading remains popular.  According to data from DappRadar, China is one of the countries that sends the most visitors to its NFT pages. However, relative to its population, China ranks low. Over time the number of people across the globe turning to DappRadar’s NFT pages has declined, according to data the company supplied. This is a trend that has echoed across crypto markets this year because of economic events and major crypto companies collapsing including stablecoin issuer Terra, hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and centralized finance lender Celsius Network.  OpenSea and Magic Eden both declined CoinDesk’s request for comment on the estimated number of Chinese VPN users who trade on their platforms.  Regulatory uncertainty  There is no national policy on NFTs in China to define what platforms can and can’t do. This creates compliance risks for creators, platforms and brands active in the space, who have no clear compliance guidelines, said Nassim Toui, communications manager at venture capital firm Sino Global Capital.  In April, three banking industry associations issued a statement looking to “resolutely curb” the financialization of NFTs, meaning financial risks related to hyping the assets, money laundering and other illegal activities.  While their statements don’t carry legal validity, industry associations in China issue standards and self-regulatory statements that can be a precursor to or substitute for government regulation.  Some of these associations issued a statement condemning crypto on May 18, 2021, just days before Chinese regulators announced a renewed crackdown on the industry.  There are many investors hoping to benefit from NFTs in China, but they are “just looking for profits between the cracks,” said artist Chi. “Because of no sound regulations, probably the life cycle of China’s NFT will be greatly shortened. In the long run, I'm not optimistic.”  At the same time, regulators see value in NFT technology beyond art. Red Date Technology, a state-backed firm that is building an “internet of blockchains,” has created a multi-chain platform for developers to build and launch NFTs. Red Date claim that transactions on this platform surpassed the Ethereum mainnet’s daily volume on June 29 and Aug. 18. CoinDesk has no way of independently verifying Red Date’s data.  At the same time, at least one local government policy calls for further investment and development of NFTs and the metaverse. The city of Shanghai called for the development of the industry in its latest five-year plan, published in June, particularly for the protection and circulation of intellectual property.  The government’s main concerns are financial and cultural, BlockCreateArt’s Sun said. As long as people don’t invest unwisely and lose their money, or use NFTs to promote political, violent or pornographic content, the government will not try to eliminate the industry.  “It's not the right time yet” for regulation, Red Date CEO He told CoinDesk, adding that it may take another six months or even one year “for the regulator to fully understand [NFTs], for them to see that the market has become mature, and that they know where to regulate. Right now, they don't even know where to regulate.”  Wang sees regulation eventually coming to NFTs in China to clarify the rules regarding public chains like Ethereum and crypto payments for purchases.  According to the set of rules that came into effect in 2019, all blockchain service providers must register with the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the top internet regulator. They must also follow a host of other rules, such as performing real-name identification checks, censor content on their platforms and store user data.  Due in part to these regulations, digital collectibles in China use homegrown layer 1, or base, blockchains. For example, Ant Group's digital collectibles platform Jingtan issued all its digital collections on its own AntChain.  The BSN has created a set of localized versions of permissionless blockchains like Ethereum and Cosmos.  In late July, at least one-quarter of the CAC’s list of approved blockchain licenses were NFT platforms, up from 2% in the previous batch, wrote Beijing-based political affairs consultancy Trivium China in its newsletter.  Big names test the water  Big Tech has rushed to enter the market, and to show regulators they are doing so in a compliant way.  Major tech companies have launched their own Chinese NFT platforms and are looking to get in on the action. Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Group, Tencent, Baidu, and JD.com are among the tech giants that have launched their own platforms or NFT collections.  Alibaba, Ant Group and Tencent declined to comment for this story.  In June, Tencent’s super-app WeChat, through which much of China’s digital life is conducted, changed its content policy to ban content related to NFT trading.  Just days later, 30 institutions issued a self-regulation code in which they promised to resist the financialization of NFTs and adhere to rules about licensing and real-name authentication. Ant Group, Baidu, Tencent and JD.com signed the document.  However, with platforms mostly doing single sales for each digital collectible – meaning each NFT can only be sold once for a certain period of time – their potential for transaction commissions is significantly lower than for their international counterparts. Tencent closed one of two NFT platforms in order to cut costs, Chinese media outlet Jiemian reported in July 20.  Similarly, big brands have entered the field: There are some successful examples of marketing using NFTs, such as sportswear brands Li-Ning’s latest marketing event in Beijing’s trendy Sanlitun neighborhood using Bored Ape Yacht Club, said Wang. However, not all big brands are necessarily savvy enough to do NFT drops, and some celebrities are afraid they could be doing the wrong thing, she said.  Some big tech firms are doing NFT drops overseas, such as streaming platform Bilibili and social e-commerce site Xiaohongshu. While they are very conservative at home, these companies are participating in Web3 outside the great firewall, Wang said.  Red Date’s He said that on the DDC platform the majority of traded NFTs – around 70% – constitutes digital merchandise, such as paintings and images sold by brands. These are sometimes combined with offline elements, meaning buying an NFT grants consumers access to some limited-edition physical goods, He said.  There are more novel applications of NFTs, such as event tickets, but these are sparse. “We see a lot of good ideas,” but they are far from implementation, He said.

42421451,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMeL,1663172407,3 Big Things the Merge Will Change About Ethereum,"At press time, estimates are that Ethereum’s Merge, or the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake-based transaction validation and settlement, will happen around 1 a.m. ET, or 5 a.m. UTC, on Sept. 15. It’s probably the most significant piece of crypto news since the collapse of Three Arrows Capital in June.  The Merge is, thankfully, much more positive. If you’re looking for a fundamental explainer or some last-second insights into how to trade the Merge, we’ve got you. But my job is the big picture, so here are the three most important things the Merge will change – and the one important thing it will not.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Lower fees? No.  The most important thing the Merge WON’T accomplish is reducing transaction fees on Ethereum. It’s certainly what many users would have wished for, and lower fees may eventually be enabled by infrastructure changes made in the Merge. But it won’t happen immediately.  That means, above all, there’s still going to be a serious place in the crypto world for alternate layer 1 blockchains like Solana and Near, as well as for layer 2s like Optimism and Polygon, which save user’s fees by “rolling up” batches of transactions to post to Ethereum.  Somewhat ironically, Ethereum fees have actually jumped by around 25% to an average of over $3 per transaction since Tuesday, likely in part thanks to traders and holders repositioning for the Merge. Fees are still quite low historically, but if you’re reading this earlyish Wednesday take care of your moves soon because those fees are likely to rise further as the day goes on.  See also: Monitoring the Merge: What a Successful Ethereum Upgrade Will Look Like  The ecological premium  By removing computationally intensive proof-of-work mining from Ethereum, the Merge is expected to reduce the network’s overall energy consumption by more than 99%. For at least five years, the ecological impact of proof-of-work mining has been a major headwind for blockchain adoption in general, and the transition has at least two specific catalytic implications for Ethereum.  First, as a recent Bank of America report argued, some institutions or other investors who were reluctant or unable to invest in proof-of-work systems will now be free to stake Ethereum. That’s not necessarily going to be an instant sea change given the bear market but could have huge upside implications for crypto’s next bull cycle.  Second, and I think more important, the shift to proof-of-stake totally transforms the playing field for non-fungible tokens (NFT). As silly as things got during the last bull cycle, NFTs are one of the clearest cases of real, end-user product-market fit on Ethereum, and I’m extremely bullish on the concept long term.  But a lot of artists and consumers seem to have a general antipathy to blockchains tied up in environmental concerns. That’s not their only gripe, but removing that issue will be huge for the appeal of digital art on Ethereum in the long term.  Censorship risk  Just three weeks before the expected date of the Merge, financial regulators at the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) dropped a bomb on the crypto world with the sanctioning of the Ethereum-based Tornado Cash mixer. There remain a lot of unknown implications, but many developers and node operators decided they needed to protect themselves by unilaterally censoring transactions associated with Tornado Cash.  The Merge makes moments like this far more worrisome, for a variety of complex reasons. Proof-of-stake-based settlement is widely expected to concentrate more power in the hands of the biggest Ethereum stakers, including very public entities like Jump Trading.  These entities may, in turn, be more susceptible to pressure from entities like OFAC, which could lead to “base layer censorship,” or systemwide refusal to process transactions associated with entities sanctioned by governments.  This is a worst-case scenario and, hopefully, it won’t happen. But the fact that it’s possible, and would undermine the system neutrality that should be part of any blockchain’s core value proposition, is a real cause for long-term concern and vigilance.  The network state of ETHistan  Luckily, the fourth big consequence of the Merge is much more upbeat: It’s one of the first big examples of a globally coordinated network transition in crypto. Bitcoin has had its own drama around upgrades and forks, but never anything quite like the Merge.  While it’s true that Ethereum has a significant advantage given the leadership role of the Ethereum Foundation and co-creator Vitalik Buterin, it is still a huge, global ecosystem whose stakeholders have all had to stay on the same page through the complex process of the Merge.  It’s a tentative, partial example, but in this light the Merge looks a bit like Balaji Srinivasan’s concept of “the Network State.” Very broadly, Srinivasan believes that digital communities, some organized around blockchains, will begin to mimic some of the features of the offline governance units we think of as “nations” now.  Bitcoin already has many features of a network state, but Ethereum’s much richer technological underpinnings may form a more fitting foundation for the many complex potentials of a network state. The Merge, assuming it’s successful, could be seen as a moment of “national unity” for Ethereans, strengthening the community as much as anything technological.  See also: Here's How Equity Investors Can Play Ethereum’s Merge  Of course, not everyone has gotten on board with the Merge, particularly a few folks trying to keep proof-of-work Ethereum going. Frankly, it’s hard to see that effort as anything but a short con intended to fleece the naïve, but even if it were sincere it’s arguably the exception that proves the rule. You can’t have a nation, after all, without a few dissenters.  At the risk of overstating the case, from this perspective the Merge could be an important display of unity and power by the Ethereum “nation.” That may be particularly important for some of the looming fights around base-layer censorship and the regulation of utility-focused tokens.

42394745,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVQQe,1663171031,A Full Percentage Point Rate Hike? Bitcoin Traders Size Up Fed’s Desperation on Inflation,"Traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange changed their outlook on the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision dramatically overnight.  Speculation is mounting the central bank may raise the official U.S. interest rate by a full percentage point for the first time since the early 1990s, reflecting the growing unease among traders and policymakers about unrelenting inflation. Just a month ago, traders were almost fully pricing in 50 basis points.  The concern in traditional markets has spilled over into cryptocurrencies, as seen in Tuesday’s 9.9% plunge in bitcoin's (BTC) price, its steepest drop in more than three weeks.  With August inflation numbers out hot on Tuesday, many economists have turned pessimistic on their economic outlook. So did some traders, who now see a 32% chance of a full percentage point (100 basis points) rate hike by the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting next week – a magnitude that hasn’t happened since 1994. That is according to the CME FedWatch tool, which tracks bond traders' trades.  The Fed wants to see inflation running at a target rate of 2% annually. The U.S. consumer price index report showed that in August prices were 8.3% higher than the year before, or about 6 percentage points above the target.  “Today’s CPI report confirms that the U.S. has a serious inflation problem,” former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers tweeted Tuesday. “If I had to choose between 100 basis points in September and 50 basis points, I would choose 100 basis points move to reinforce credibility.”  Even though year-over-year inflation cooled to 8.3% in August from 8.5% in July, core inflation, which is more closely watched because it excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.6% during the month, compared with a 0.3% increase during the month before.  “Markets capitulated on that reality, and we now are starting to understand that there is no `Fed pivot’ coming as traders were hopeful for in the short term,” Howard Greenberg, a cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy, said.  “I will be watching the U.S. dollar index (DXY) closely leading into the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),” he said. “We had seen bitcoin rally as DXY cooled off last week but expect more downside if that breaks back above $110.50 as traders go more risk-off.”  The FOMC will be meeting next week, on Sep. 21-22, and is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate for a fifth consecutive time.

42421111,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSqT,1663170849,"Google’s $4B Fine May Threaten Web3 Protocols, Legal Expert Says","A European Union (EU) court judgment issued Wednesday didn’t just uphold one of the world’s biggest-ever antitrust fines, but it also carries a warning for developers of future Web3 open-source protocols, a legal expert has told CoinDesk.  Ostensibly targeting one of the giants of Web 2.0 – Google – EU judges may have effectively constrained open-source developers by restricting controls on how their creations evolve, Amsterdam University’s Thibault Schrepel told CoinDesk.  The complaint originated in 2018, when antitrust enforcers from the European Commission said the search giant and its parent company Alphabet had restricted competition by effectively forcing Android phones to pre-install Google's own search app, and imposed a record-breaking sanction of 4.343 billion euros (US$4.336 billion).  That decision was largely upheld by judges at the EU General Court Wednesday, even if they reduced the fine slightly to 4.125 billion euros. However, buried in their 1,100 paragraphs of legal reasoning is a potential bombshell for open-source developers.  $4 billion question  “Should a Web3 company develop an operating system, platform or aggregator, the Android ruling holds that pre-installing apps is likely illegal,” Schrepel, an associate professor of law at Amsterdam Law & Technology Institute in the Netherlands, said in a written interview – assuming, of course, that such a company had the fortune to grow so large as to dominate its market.  But there’s also a potential hurdle for any protocol that seeks to prevent forks – alternative evolutions that other developers produce based on the source code – or to remove them when they occur, says Schrepel, who specializes in blockchain antitrust issues.  While the Android operating system is in theory open source, Google imposed restrictions if the phone wasn't running a version of the software it had approved. Thus, there's an implication for other open protocols.  “If you succeed and take the fork down, the practice could be seen as anti-competitive: You have reduced market entry, thus competitive pressure,” Schrepel said. “In the case of a fork, you better hope it dies on its own because if you start to intervene you are in trouble.”  According to the court, Schrepel says, “limiting market access is abusive even if the practice is implemented to prevent the collapse of the ecosystem due to incompatible versions.”  Code was law  Some crypto fans quibble at attempts to legislate or litigate how Web3 systems should work – arguing that the only law that should apply is the code underpinning a protocol. For Schrepel, judicial intervention has pluses and minuses.  “Code is law … but code also needs law,” he said. “Blockchain code can do nothing against the fact that some tech giants are banning blockchain advertisements.”  But, he argues, by heaping extra requirements on open-source systems, courts might actually be pushing developers towards other, ostensibly less pro-competitive, models. Apple, for example, doesn’t face the kind of legal uncertainties now faced by the likes of Google because it only lets the iPhone run its own proprietary iOS system.  “I question whether this is the Europe we want, one that sends a positive signal to closed systems as opposed to open ones,” Schrepel said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/14/googles-4bn-fine-may-threaten-web3-protocols-legal-expert-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8174d0cca6fbe7a9c9380bbb2d7559a20e317aad-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394743,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVQOg,1663168098,Here's How Equity Investors Can Play Ethereum’s Merge,"Crypto traders are gearing up for Ethereum’s Merge, the blockchain's transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), with assorted markets-related trades. But it's slim pickings for equity investors who want to participate.  “TradFi [traditional finance] investors don’t really have many options yet [to play the Merge] in the public markets,” said Paul McCaffery, co-head of equities and head of alternative capital sales at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “Many institutional investors are looking forward to [trading] CME offering ether futures that just went live Sept. 12,” he said.  Read more: Ethereum Merge Explained: What Investors Should Know About the Shift to Proof-of-Stake  Nevertheless, there are some potential plays in equity markets, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) among them, according to Wall Street analysts. “At current [ether] ETH price/staked ETH we estimate COIN could generate $250MM revenue and $60MM contribution profit annualized,” said investment bank Cowen’s analysts led by Stephen Glagola in a Sept. 12 research note.  However, he noted that the potential impact of the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) censoring transactions related to sanctioned addresses as a key risk factor on the exchange's staking business. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on Aug. 18, that he prefers not censoring transactions to and from those addresses after the transition to proof-of-stake.  Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan analysts also saw the Merge as potential short-term positive catalyst for Coinbase.  ESG and the miners  The change is expected to eliminate miners and reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by at least 99.95%. This might bring the debate over environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects of PoW versus PoS to the forefront because it could allow some institutional investors, who were barred from buying tokens that run on PoW, to purchase ether for the first time, Bank of America analysts said in a report this week.  There could also be an indirect impact on the crypto miners, with U.S. lawmakers having scrutinized the PoW process in recent months. “Successful Merge could increase scrutiny and U.S. jurisdiction risk on energy-intensive PoW mining,” said Cowen’s Glagola.  Miners exposed to ether mining, such as Hive Blockchain (HIVE) and Hut 8 Mining (HUT), could also be affected because they will have to pivot to other mineable coins such as ethereum classic (ETC) or repurpose their available fleets of graphics processing units (GPU). Both companies are planning on doing just that.  How the transition will impact the stocks, will likely be worth watching.  Chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for the GPUs may also see knock-on effects resulting from the Merge. “For GPU suppliers Nvidia and to a lesser extent AMD, we view the upcoming Merge as a long-term positive for sentiment as it likely removes the risk of another painful crypto bang/bust cycle in the future,” Cowen wrote.  This could be particularly true for chip giant Nvidia as it continued to see its cryptocurrency mining processor (CMP) sales declining, dragging down revenues for its “OEM and Other” business unit.  Lesser-known stocks  There are some other smaller stocks exposed to the Ethereum network’s upgrade. Canadian listed Ether Capital (ETHC) is one. The company focuses on yield generation and providing infrastructure that supports the Ethereum ecosystem, according to its website. It owned 44,600 ether and staked ether as of Aug. 12, according to its latest investor presentation.  Another option is Tokens.com, which invests in Web3 assets and staking is among one of its businesses, according to its most recent investor presentation.  “Staking rewards continue to represent attractive revenue opportunities for long-term investors as they provide returns that are paid in kind,” investment bank Stifel Canada analyst Bill Papanastasiou said in an Aug. 25 research note. “We note that both [Tokens.com] and [Ether Capital] continue to stake a significant portion of their portfolio and are earning high margins (roughly ~95%).""

The addresses were specifically tied to two individuals – Amir Hossein Nikaeen Ravari and Ahmad Khatibi Aghada – who allegedly helped develop and deploy ransomware as members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), according to a press release published by the Treasury Department.  The sanctioning came as U.S. government officials charged three individuals with hacking-related crimes. Alongside Mansour Ahmadi, Nikaeen Ravari and Aghada allegedly broke into hundreds of U.S. companies and deployed ransomware to several of these entities, including U.S. infrastructure entities, the Justice Department claimed.  The individuals are part of a hacker group that targeted hospitals, transportation companies and schools with ransomware, Treasury officials said in a press statement. It further accused the group of mounting a cyberattack against a rural electric utility company in October 2021.  The wallets did not contain any bitcoin Tuesday, having drained their balances between last October and this past May. One address linked to both individuals held 2.49 BTC over the course of its life.  Several of the addresses have not been active since 2021, according to on-chain data.  The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has added a number of Iranian officials to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list in recent weeks over cyberattacks allegedly committed by members of Iran’s government.  U.S. persons and entities – meaning anyone on American soil or any U.S. citizens abroad – are barred from transacting with the addresses or people added to the sanctions list.  Last week, OFAC added Iran’s Minister of Intelligence, Esmail Khatib, and its Ministry of Intelligence and Security, to the SDN list for allegedly attacking the country of Albania, which faced an unspecified hack earlier this year (Iran has denied the allegations).  OFAC has sanctioned crypto wallet addresses for years now, having first done so in 2018 when two other Iranian residents were accused of laundering funds for ransomware creators.

The collection contains &apos;Guitar on a Table,&apos; a 1919 painting by Pablo Picasso, and pieces by Renoir and Rodin. At MoMA later this year, Sotheby&apos;s will hold an auction of 29 of Paley&apos;s 81 works. Expansion Of Digital Traffic Glenn Lowry, Director of the MoMA, noted that the objective is to expand the institution&apos;s digital reach because traffic fell off during and after the epidemic.

42394757,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVQdR,1663167316,"First Mover Americas: Ethereum Merge Spawns Watch Parties, But 'Jail Kwon' Token Gets More Hype","Price Point: The approach of the Ethereum Merge has lots of crypto types planning watch parties, but it looks like traders are betting on price declines. Bitcoin stabilized quickly Wednesday after its steepest price drop since mid-August on Tuesday, while yields on U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities hit their highest level since 2018.  Market Moves: The ""jail kwon"" token represents the epitome of crypto-market ridiculousness. The price soared nearly 40-fold after a South Korean court issued an arrest warrant for the founder of Terraform Labs.  Chart of the Day: Trading volume in ether is soaring as the Merge speculation intensifies.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  By Omkar Godbole and Bradley Keoun  The Ethereum blockchain's Merge – its shift to a more energy-efficient ""proof-of-stake"" network, seen by many analysts and developers as a historic milestone for the growing industry – is almost here. Crypto types are throwing watch parties.  According to ethernodes.org, the Merge is now about 17 hours away. CoinDesk's Sam Kessler and Sage D. Young just published a cheat sheet on how to monitor the Merge as it unfolds.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  In the meantime, crypto markets appeared to have somewhat stabilized following the biggest sell-off since mid-August. Bitcoin fell 9.9% on Tuesday after a hotter-than-expected U.S. consumer price index report on inflation rekindled expectations that the Federal Reserve will be hawkish for a longer period of time than previously thought. The CoinDesk Market Index was up slightly on Wednesday.  At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was holding above $20,000. Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, gained 1% to $1,590 as funding rates in the perpetual futures market went further into negative territory – an indicator that more traders are betting the price will drop.  The path of least resistance for the crypto market appeared to be on the downside, with real or inflation-adjusted bond yields rallying. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities, which are adjusted periodically to compensate for consumer-price increases, rose above 1%, the highest since 2018:  CoinDesk Market Index  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Ravencoin RVN  +13.17% Currency Celsius CEL  +11.72% Currency LCX LCX  +5.85% Currency  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA2  -46.99% Smart Contract Platform Terra Luna Classic LUNA  -25.87% Smart Contract Platform Lido DAO LDO  -5.75% DeFi  Sector classifications are provided via the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), developed by CoinDesk Indices to provide a reliable, comprehensive and standardized classification system for digital assets.

Market Moves  'Jail Kwon' Token Surges 387% After Terra Founder's Arrest  By Omkar Godbole  The crypto-markets spectacle of the day came from nearly 40-fold price rally in a meme coin named after Do Kwon, founder of the now-defunct Terraform Labs.  The recently launched jail kwon (jkwon) token, the self-proclaimed home of the world's first educate-to-earn program, rose 387% to $0.000908, according to the crypto data and analysis firm Messari.  The price surge came after a South Korean court issued an arrest warrant for Kwon, the primary developer of Terra's UST stablecoin, which crashed in May, destroying billions of dollars' worth of investor wealth.  ""An arrest warrant has been issued for a total of six people, including Do Kwon, who are currently residing in Singapore,"" a spokesperson for the South Korean prosecutors said on Wednesday.  According to Bloomberg, the individuals have been accused of violating South Korea's Capital Markets Act.  The jail kwon token went live on BNB Chain early this month and is listed on decentralized exchange PancakeSwap under the ticker JKWON.  The token’s white paper says the project's mission is to combine Web3 with Web2 to deliver something unique to the crypto market and ""leverage the social media relevance and presence of Do Kwon and the Luna crash along with our Educate-to-Earn protocol to drive the awareness of the token.""  The white paper adds that educating the community on crypto safety as the core fundamental of the token and Kwon's infamy would ensure a lifetime of ""free marketing and spontaneous pumps.""  While the jkwon token rallied, Terra's luna and luna classic tokens plunged as investors withdrew millions from the Terra-based decentralized-finance ecosystem.  Read the full story here.  Chart of The Day  Ether Futures Volume Hits 3-Month High  By Omkar Godbole  The aggregate daily volume rose to $61 billion on Tuesday, the highest since June 13, according to data tracked by Skew.

Global crypto adoption rates have slowed during the bear market this year, but the slump didn't wipe out the growth in adoption during bull markets, Chainalysis said in the report accompanying this year's index. Crypto use globally remains higher than pre-bull market levels with emerging markets leading the way, according to the report. In its 2021 report, Chainalysis reported a 880% jump in adoption levels year over year.  Vietnam tops the index for the second year with the Philippines a close second. Of the 20 countries leading the list, 10 (including the top two) are lower-middle-income countries including Ukraine, India, Pakistan and Nigeria while eight are upper-middle-income countries such as Brazil and Thailand.  ""One reason for this could be the value that users in emerging markets get from cryptocurrency. These countries dominate the adoption index, in large part because cryptocurrency provides unique, tangible benefits to people living in unstable economic conditions,"" the report said.  China, where crypto trading and mining is prohibited, grabbed the number 10 spot on the index up three places from last year. Chainalysis' data suggests that the country's crypto ban has either been ""ineffective"" or ""loosely enforced,"" according to the report.  Read more: China Crypto Bans: A Complete History  The blockchain analytics firm uses five indexes that look at cryptocurrency moving through centralized platforms like crypto exchanges, peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to determine which countries make it onto the list. This year's methodology was updated to include two metrics that look at DeFi transaction volume.  ""We did this for two reasons: First, as we explain above, to highlight countries leading the way in DeFi given its importance to the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem. Second, we wanted to address the issue of DeFi-driven inflation of transaction volume,"" the report said.  Chainalysis also relies on web traffic data, which could prove troublesome for determining location given crypto users' proclivity for virtual private networks (VPN), which mask geographical data. Even so, Chainalysis said usage rates are not likely high enough to ""meaningfully skew"" its findings.

42411088,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC098,1663163664,Can Web3 Remake Hollywood?,"nZo is a professional wrestler. He was just caught having sex with the mistress of the guy who owns the wrestling league. The owner is furious. So he has nZo kidnapped and tortured. Now nZo hangs upside down from a ceiling.  “Excuse me, nZo sir,” the torturer says. “Now it’s time to electrocute your balls.”  They begin zapping his testicles.  Meanwhile, another gang of wrestlers – from a rival wrestling league, called the WWW (Wrestling Wrestling Wrestling) – hatches a plan to rescue nZo from his testicular torture. They debate the best way to rescue him. Should they break into the prison using stealth? Or with explosives? Or with a mysterious third option called the “DIC punch,” pronounced “dick punch”?  That’s up for you to decide.  The scenario comes from Episode 3 of the animated Web3 series ""The Gimmicks,"" created by a company called ToonStar, and developed by a production team that includes Mila Kunis. Think of it as ""South Park"" meets wrestling meets crypto. It’s raw and vulgar and a bit uneven. (On a community Zoom that streamed a cut of the episodes, someone suggested doing shots for every line of profanity. Kunis had a quick response: “We’d be dead.”)  Read more: NFTs Take Hollywood: My Week at NFT LA  But ""The Gimmicks"" is also something more. It could be an early glimpse at the future of community-driven storytelling. What if fans are given creative agency? What if they can help steer the story? Brainstorm with the writers? Create characters?  “Entertainment will be one of the things that will help Web3 go mainstream,” says John Attanasio, CEO and co-founder of Toonstar. “We’re very much committed to that as a company.”  Attanasio has a background in traditional Hollywood. He spent years at Dreamworks and Warner Bros., working on marketing, biz dev and digital content creation. At Warner Bros. he had a wild idea: What if we could help super-fans create their own content? Along with his Warner Bros colleague Luisa Huang, he helped launch an internal incubator to create digital content.  The idea would be to create stories and content that were “complementary” to the larger intellectual property (IP) owned by Warner Bros. Consider Harry Potter. As every shipper of Harry and Hermione knows, there’s an ocean of fan fiction, cosplayers and YouTubers who are eager to create their own Harry Potter stories, and they usually do it for free. Why not work with them to collaborate? Why not empower them to create Harry Potter content that could be “adjacent” to the official HP canon? You can imagine this concept applied to the entire portfolio of Warner Bros intellectual property: Batman and Superman and the DC Universe, Mad Max, The Matrix – the coffers are deep.  Attanasio and Huang fleshed out the idea and they pitched it to the higher-ups.  It never went anywhere.  “People weren’t taking YouTube and building digital communities seriously,” says Attanasio. “We would be in meetings with very senior, senior folks, and they were fairly dismissive.” The studio execs would often say “that’s not real content” or “those aren’t real stories” or “those aren’t real creators.”  They did have a few senior-level sponsors who thought the idea had legs. As Attanasio remembers, one of them said, “You might be better served trying to do something outside the walls of the studio.”  So they followed that advice.  In 2015, Attanasio and Huang left their stable jobs at Warner Bros. to launch Toonstar, which focused on bringing animated stories to Web2 platforms. Why animation? Attanasio felt the tech was really only accessible to the “private club” of larger studios, and it “felt weird that more creators didn’t have access to the medium.”  The iPhone’s camera had helped democratize filmmaking, but animation was only for the deep-pocketed. Toonstar would change that. In a downtown Los Angeles loft, along with a team of five employees, Attanasio and Huang spent two years building the infrastructure.  Then they launched in 2017. The good news was they succeeded in getting amateur creators to use the tech and embrace animation. People could finally animate their ideas! Animation had been democratized!  The bad news is that most of it was junk.  Their colleagues had said they were crazy and now, years later, all they had to show for it was a talking turd.  The problem with “user-generated content” is that most users fail to generate good content. One of the animated characters, for example, was a talking turd. Attanasio felt queasy and thought, “This might not be ready for primetime.”  One of Toonstar’s largest investors flat-out told them, “This isn’t working.” The end was near. Maybe the studio execs were right: Those aren’t real stories. Those aren’t real creators. Attanasio and Huang had left those plum jobs at Warner Bros. to revolutionize animation, their colleagues had said they were crazy and now, years later, all they had to show for it was a talking turd.  Just not good enough  “All right, screw this,” Huang thought back then, realizing that to save the business, “we’ve got to do something completely radical.” Toonstar had made a bet on user-generated content. The bet failed. “We knew the tech worked,” says Huang, but the problem was that the “inputs,” or the stories themselves, were not up to snuff.  So Toonstar pivoted. Instead of creating animation tech for the masses, it would selectively work with storytellers. This was a Web2 play. Starting in 2018, the company began to target Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and eventually Snapchat and Tik-Tok storytellers, and injected their content with animation.  Now Toonstar found real traction. It worked with creators like Parker James (8.7 million followers on TikTok) and Amber Scholl (3.6 million followers on YouTube) to create bite-sized animated shorts, such as adapting Scholl’s story about an awkward first date into a charming animated vignette. They racked up tens of millions of views per month.  They brought more eyeballs and the company secured more funding. But it lacked just one small thing: Steady revenue. “People were going to Facebook to watch the content that we were producing,” says Huang, who notes that Facebook earned plenty of ad revenue. “But what about us? What about the people making the content?”  Sure, the platforms had revenue-sharing models. Toonstar tried to play that game, but was frustrated by what seemed like the changing whims of the all-powerful algorithm. Ultimately, Huang found that “it’s just not good enough to sustain a real business model.”  The Web2 model felt broken.  Enter Web3.  Enter ""The Gimmicks.""  The third man  John R. Rivera was introduced to wrestling as a five-year-old kid, when his Puerto Rican grandmother was so excited by the matches that she would throw her chanklas (flip-flops) at the TV. Every Saturday the two of them ate Jello and watched wrestling. In 1997, using the ring name Rocky Romero, he made his wrestling debut at the age of 14; he’s been a professional wrestler ever since, currently with the NJPW (New Japan Pro-Wrestling).  While on tour in Japan, mostly just to pass the time, he and his wrestling buddies Karl Anderson and Doc Gallows created early wrestling podcasts – the production value was skimpy and they used their iPhones. Fast forward to COVID-19. With wrestling on lockdown and plenty of time on their hands, they dusted off their old podcast and cranked up the production value, incorporating their wrestling alter-egos “Chad 2 Badd” and “Sex Ferguson.”  They were funny and likable. Their podcast began to get noticed. And soon they were having conversations with Toonstar, which by now specialized in helping creators expand and sharpen their stories. “We knew there was a story we wanted to tell about these lovable losers,” says Huang. She and Attanasio, meanwhile, had been intrigued by the early success of ""Stoner Cats,"" the non-fungible token (NFT)-infused animation project launched in part by Mila Kunis, who also stars in the show. ToonStar pitched ""The Gimmicks"" to Kunis and team; they wanted in and came on board as founders of the project. (Romero and the wrestlers stayed attached as well, and now they voice their characters.)  The idea started as just a Web3 version of a wrestling promotion. Soon it snowballed into an entire Web3 TV series, with a proper story arc and characters. Toonstar hired “the Daves,” David Wright and David Ihlenfeld, veteran comedy screenwriters who worked on shows including ""Family Guy"" and ""Star Trek: Lower Decks.""  The way they turned this stupid joke into an actual something is just mind-blowing to me.  The Daves are longtime writing partners who finish each other’s sentences; they live three minutes apart in LA but collaborate almost entirely remotely. And now they had a gig with little precedent in the history of Hollywood. They would write a show in collaboration with a community of fans. “It is kind of scary, for someone who’s used to plotting things out and outlining things to death,” says David Ihlenfeld. “To cede that kind of control is a little terrifying.”  Here’s how it works. Toonstar dropped 10,000 NFTs of “Gimmicks” to the community. They gave them away for free. Each NFT is a wrestling character with a unique look and “gimmick.” It’s up to the NFT holders to flesh out their character’s backstory and bring their own stylistic flourish. (Other 10,000-NFT communities, such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club, have a similar playbook.) The more Gimmick NFTs you own, the more voting power you have.  There’s less chaos than you might think. The overarching shape of the story is developed by the writing team of The Daves, co-creators Attanasio and Huang and the executive producer team of Mila Kunis (who attends meetings and gives notes), Lindsey McInerney (CEO of Sixth Wall) and Lisa Sterbakov (a partner at Kunis’ Orchard Farm Productions).  Read more: Bored Apes Go Hollywood With Coinbase-Produced Movie Trilogy  That part of the creative process, more or less, resembles the normal studio system. The writers write. The execs give notes. The Daves write a six- or seven-page script for each episode (there are 20 in the first season, each around 3 minutes long), but every script is packed with TBDs – “fill in the blanks” that the community of NFT holders will decide. Sometimes the TBDs are inconsequential, sometimes they ripple through the entire show.  Each episode ends with a cliffhanger, and then asks the community to vote on what should happen next. This somehow happens on a weekly schedule. New episodes drop on a Friday, the Gimmicks community has the weekend to vote and then The Daves scramble to incorporate that input into the following episode that airs just days later. None of this could happen without the animation tech that Toonstar spent years building.  But are crowds good at creating art? The “consensus” choice is often safe and boring. No hive mind could create ""Hamlet,"" the Sistine Chapel or even a mainstream masterpiece like “The Dark Knight.” When hordes of fans clamor to have their voices heard, the results can be muddled and messy and mediocre. (Exhibit A: ""The Rise of Skywalker."")  “It’s a balance,” says Attanasio, who acknowledges the inherent tension between giving the community agency and ceding too much creative control. He admits that a few of the community ideas have been “cringe,” but says they’ve struck a balance by thinking of creative inputs in two different buckets: prompts and white space.  Many of the choices are prompts: Who should nZo wrestle in the first-ever “prison match”? The Accountant, the Straight Jacket or the Juvie? The Daves suggest the prompts, which gives the show some creative guardrails. This is very much a Choose Your Adventure, a la the interactive ""Black Mirror"" episode ""Bandersnatch.""  But the show also permits room for the “white space” of pure fan invention, such as incorporating the community’s Gimmick NFTs into the actual episodes. And two of the episodes are 100% community-created and exist “outside of the canon,” which is remarkably similar to Huang and Attanasio’s idea rebuffed by Warner Bros. all those years ago of empowering fans to create non-official Harry Potter content. And if I’m an executive at Disney or Warner Bros. or Universal, I am absolutely paying attention to Web3 projects like ""The Gimmicks"" – new revenue streams are just waiting to gush. (The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s “multiverse,” in particular, seems ideally suited to monetize fans’ creativity. Kevin Feige, call me.)  This “white space” also gives a window into what ""The Gimmicks"" community finds so appealing. Ben Collinsworth, based in New Orleans, has a background in traditional film and TV production; he worked on the crews of ""Oblivion"" and ""Planet of the Apes."" A longtime wrestling enthusiast, Collinsworth quickly became obsessed with ""The Gimmicks"" and now owns 95 Gimmicks NFTs, making him one of the largest holders. He spent hour after hour writing backstories for his NFT wrestlers. At first “Gimmicks #6962” was just a blank slate, but Collinsworth felt inspired and dubbed him “Tchoupitoulas Tcharlie,” or the “People’s Champ” and also the face of Sugarcane Wrestling Social, a “combination of live wrestling, music, and great food.” Now Tchoupitoulas Tcharlie will appear in an upcoming episode.  To explain his role in the Gimmicks ecosystem, Collinsworth describes a key wrestling concept called “the third man.” When two wrestlers are in the ring, sometimes a third man – who’s not originally part of the action – dramatically enters the fray and swings the contest. In 1996, for example, in what might be the most famous Third Man twist, Randy Savage is fighting Kevin Nash and then, out of nowhere, from the edge of the arena…in walks Hulk Hogan! The crowd roars. “Hulk Hogan is here! Hulk Hogan is in the building!” the announcers breathlessly exclaim. Hogan then attacks Randy Savage – his former ally! – and turns heel, joining the rival nWo. The Third Man injects a fight with surprise, drama and conflict.  I’m charmed by Collinsworth’s fondness of wrestling history, but at first I don’t understand how it fits into Web3 storytelling. Then he makes it clear.  “I’m the third man,” says Collinsworth.  He clarifies that it’s not just him, personally, but any of the passionate NFT holders who are part of the Gimmicks community – they have the power to crash the ring and change the story. Collinsworth even hopes to see creative and financial upside. “As this gets bigger and as we’re looking down the road, I have other things that I’m trying to put in front of this that will make me money,” says Collinsworth.  How would that happen, exactly?  “Merchandiiiiiizing!” he says with a showman’s panache, quoting “Yogurt” from the movie ""Spaceballs."" If ""The Gimmicks"" catch fire and if Tchoupitoulas Tcharlie is a hit, maybe one day he could sell Tcharlie lunch boxes, Tcharlie breakfast cereal, Tcharlie flame throwers.  All of that, of course, feels very much like a long shot. But there are more immediate ways that Collinsworth and his fellow NFT holders can contribute. If you win certain contests on the Discord, you can join a Zoom session with the show creators and give production input. The NFT holders have hopped on brainstorming calls. “They have a lot of great ideas, and we don’t have to pay them anything,” says David Wright with a laugh.  The creators understand this is very much an early Web3 experiment – even a gimmick – and the results are uneven. Take the weekly cliffhangers. They’re not always compelling, and you can sense that the team is still trying to work out the kinks. In the “Karen Con” episode, for example, the crew needs to find Dusty the Dog, a crypto billionaire who happens to be a dog, so they can pitch him on investing in their cash-strapped league. Where’s Dusty the Dog? At the end of the episode, in a booming voice, the wrestling announcer says, “It’s time for you to decide! Where is Dusty the Dog?” The community has three choices: The bathroom, an exclusive afterparty, or a blimp race.  In the next episode, after the NFT vote, our heroes learn that Dusty the Dog is at the exclusive afterparty. That’s where the scene begins. Understandably, the Daves use some tricks and shortcuts to quickly integrate the community choices, such as writing the bulk of the Dusty the Dog dialogue before hearing from the group. So does their input even matter?  At times it can. Take the plight of nZo, the star wrestler who was last seen having his testicles electrocuted. nZo, who is now a wanted man, needs to find a new identity and create a new “gimmick.” What should nZo’s new Gimmick be? The community voted, ultimately deciding on a creepy Willy Wonka-esque look called the Candyman. Ihlenfeld describes this vote as “super impactful,” as the decision affects multiple episodes in the future. “We went back to some of the outlines we had and we’re like, ’Okay, now he’s Candyman,’” says Ihlenfeld. “Interesting choice. Interesting challenge. Now we’ve got to change and follow what they went with.”  Ihlenfeld was at first jittery about ceding creative control, but he quickly swung around. “We did it, and the results have been amazing,” he says. “The community has taken the story in places we never would have thought to go.”  But ultimately, whether it’s Web3 or Web2 or novels or Aeschylus, storytelling is storytelling, and Ihlenfeld says “the same storytelling rules apply.” Conflict. Dramatic arcs. Character payoffs. “People are going to be surprised that these foul-mouthed idiot wrestlers are going to have defined arcs over the course of the season,” says Ihlenfeld. “You’re going to see them grow. You’re going to see these wrestling misfits become a family.”  The DIC Punch  ""The Gimmicks,"" of course, are not the only project to fuse Web3 and storytelling. Sixth Wall’s own ""Stoner Cats"" is arguably the OG. Or the “Deadheads” allows NFT owners to appear in the animated show. Members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, in collaboration with author Neil Strauss, are using a clever voting and token system to write a fictitious memoir centered around the Ape “Jenkins the Valet.” (I spoke with Strauss about it in December.)  Dan Harmon, creator of “Rick and Morty” and “Community,” is launching an animated, blockchain-infused Web3 series called ”Krapopolis” that will (presumably) experiment with audience participation. Fox Entertainment is so bullish on Web3 that it plunked down $100 million to launch its own NFT-focused studio, Blockchain Creative Labs, which CEO Charlie Collier said will help “art meet brands meet technology.”  The possibilities are fascinating, but even some of the creators are still fuzzy on exactly how, or if, Web3 will solve that nagging old problem of monetization. Take Joe Powell and Ryco Newton-Block, two stand-up comedians who hatched the idea for “Roads to Rome” way back in 2017, a show they describe as “Bojack Horseman meets Rick and Morty.” First they pitched the show through the normal Hollywood route, hoping to find an agent who could sell it to a studio or streamer. Like 99% of aspiring screenwriters (myself included), they soon tired of the chicken and egg paradox – it’s tough to get an agent without a credit, and it’s tough to get a credit without an agent. Newton-Block describes the process as a “wild circle jerk.”  So they set out to animate and produce the pilot themselves, stream it on Web2 and build a following that would bring them eyeballs, funding and proper distribution. Then they learned about NFTs. They pivoted to a Web3 model and hoped to sell 1,000 Roads to Rome NFTs, which would raise around $100K to $150K in capital and fund the first three episodes. They weren’t looking to get rich. They just wanted to cover the show’s costs. So far they’ve sold 433 NFTs with a floor price of 0.05ETH, meaning a current value of roughly $40,000. “When Ethereum slashes [its price] by 66%, that really hurt us,” says Newton-Block.  The comedian found that in the early days of the NFT space, “everything and their mother sold out,” which gave creators plenty of capital and margin for error. Those days are gone. He’s still bullish on the potential of Web3, but realistically, he knows that “you need capital to continue going.” After that first infusion of cash from the NFT drop, where does the money come from? “Eventually, there has to be some kind of monetization outside of Web3,” says Newton-Block, such as merchandising or licensing to traditional streaming services.  The CEO of Sixth Wall, Lindsey McInerney, acknowledges that because it is so focused on creating content and building communities, her company is “still working on what the revenue model looks like,” and suspects that “the revenue will take care of itself.” Fair enough. But for all the well-chronicled problems of how Web2 failed to sufficiently compensate creators, it’s not yet clear how Web3 – even if it gains adoption – will prove to be the solution.  At this early point, that might be too much to ask. The goal is play and experimentation and fun, and by that standard ""The Gimmicks"" are thriving. Toonstar announced a partnership with Hot Topic, the pop culture retail chain with 800 stores, which suddenly makes Ben Collinsworth’s ““Merchandiiiiiizing!” vision seem less far-fetched. Sixth Wall is working on an upcoming Web3 sci-fi fantasy project called “Armored Kingdom” that incorporates elements like trading cards, animation and digi-physical comic books. “What does an entertainment franchise look like when you have no rules from day one?” asks McInerney. We’ll soon find out.  But in the meantime, we’ll close with the exciting resolution of how nZo, with his testicles being electrocuted, escapes from the prison. Do our heroes rescue him with explosives? Stealth? Or the DIC punch?  The answer, of course, is the DIC punch.  This throwaway joke has become a rallying cry for the community. In the debut episode of ""The Gimmicks,"" the Daves needed to brainstorm a “finishing move” for a wrestler. “What’s the most fun, animated finishing move that you’re not going to see in reality?” Ihlenfeld asked. The Daves had a solution. A dick punch. It really wasn’t complicated. As Ihlenfeld puts it, “He just punched him in the dick.”  Then it became something more. Attanasio and Huang had the idea to turn the Dick Punch into something grander, the DIC punch, which stands for Decentralized Inclusive Community. They soon wove the concept into the community structure of ""The Gimmicks."" Now the DIC joke is everywhere. Users can send each other “DIC punches” and a scoreboard keeps track of the leaders. They recently celebrated 1 million DIC punches.  “The way they turned this stupid joke into an actual something is just mind-blowing to me,” says Ihlenfeld. They even wrote a standalone episode where a British journalist, obsessed with the mystery, goes on a dark journey to track down who threw the very first DIC punch. (Incredibly, the journalist is voiced by CoinDesk Managing Editor Ben Schiller.)  The DIC punch, at heart, is a gimmick. And like the show itself, it’s lowbrow on the surface but has a deeper, more inclusive meaning. It’s self-aware and smarter than it sounds. On the show, the DIC punch is cheerfully used by the underdog, ragtag group of wrestlers who are going up against the big machine – a mainstream wrestling league (the Federation) with deeper resources, a bigger fan base, and entrenched power.  There are worse metaphors.  As one Gimmick character says early in the season, “We need to get a f**k-ton better if we’re going to compete against the Federation.” And they do get better.  Will life imitate art? Will this kind of Web3 storytelling get good enough to become mainstream?  The answer to this larger question, at least in part, is also up to the community.",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/14/can-web3-remake-hollywood,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66aba4879c24296b8c7518160dc1aa6c1caf849a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s important for us to just work with big players who have big visions, and we share the same DNA and same visions,” said Gwendolyn Regina, investment director of BNB Chain.  Mentioning BNB Chain as one of the Web3 ecosystems that Google Cloud started to work with earlier, James Tromans, Director of Web3 of Google Cloud, said that the new partnership is really important to the firm.  “Our mission is to make Google Cloud Platform a great place for Web3 developers to build more broadly,” Tromans said, “We have a strategy that sits behind that [the collaboration], so that we can bring a lot of the engineering capabilities that Google Cloud already has to offer, but make them relevant for Web3 organizations in particular.”  This latest cooperation with BNB Chain follows Google’s push into the Web3 world. Earlier this year, Google Cloud added crypto mining malware threat detection service and launched its new dedicated Digital Assets Team.

Ownera wants to connect the tokenized platforms and trading interfaces being launched by traditional finance companies. The platform is based on the open-source FINP2P protocol and supports any type of securities tokenization engine on any public or private blockchain plus traditional ledgers. Clients have access to a unified digital securities wallet that allows the user to invest, trade, lend and borrow against the connected tokenized assets.  JPMorgan was among the first wave of big banks to move into the crypto space last year. The firm offered institutional clients access to bitcoin through two different funds custodied by NYDIG that have raised a combined total of nearly $45 million. The Ownera funding signals that TradFi hasn’t abandoned blockchain technology during the bear market.  “It is commonly accepted that the tokenization of securities has the capacity to digitize markets with total value in the trillions of dollars,” said Ownera co-founder and CEO Ami Ben-David in the press release. “Dozens of platforms are being deployed by financial institutions across the market, and our job is to be the neutral layer, seamlessly interconnecting them into one global distribution and liquidity network, using open-source network specifications.”  The funding round comes with two new board members: JPMorgan’s Scott Lucas, head of markets DLT, and LRC group Chairman Nadav Zohar.  Other investors in the round were Draper Goren Holm, tokentus Investment AG, Accomplice Blockchain, Polymorphic Capital, The Ropart Group and Archax.

On the other hand, NEAR&apos;s trading volume appears to be diminished or low even if the altcoin has amassed roughly 35% gains in that same period. So, does this mean a faltering demand for NEAR?

The longstanding crypto loans protocol is adding a borrowing service for institutions that will accept their troves of cryptos such as bitcoin and ether as collateral against stablecoin loans. The institutions will pay interest on their loans, generating yield for the DeFi users whose stablecoins Compound lent out.  All this might sound like a recipe for the leverage-tinged disaster that shook centralized crypto lending companies earlier this year when their loans to Three Arrows Capital and others went bust. But that popular narrative misses an important point about crypto lending markets.  Listen: DeFi Troubles in a Bear Market  Compound Treasury's borrows and loans love in and out of smart contracts, meaning the entire position is transparent to the public (a notable difference from the centralized lenders). Additionally, the positions are overcollateralized to protect against flakes and fluctuations in asset price.

42394742,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVQPf,1663160400,Crypto Auditing Platform Sherlock Raises $4M in Funding,"Smart contract auditing platform Sherlock has raised $4 million in a seed round led by Archetype. The funding comes during a wave of multimillion-dollar crypto hacks, which often exploit weaknesses in the underlying code of Web3 protocols.  “No auditors have incentives aligned with the protocols they audit. Sherlock is the first auditor that actually cares if a protocol they audit gets hacked because we pay out up to $10 million if they do get hacked,” Sherlock co-founder Jack Sanford told CoinDesk in an interview.  Hackers stole $1.9 billion worth of cryptocurrencies through July, up from nearly $1.2 billion at the same time last year, according to recent Chainanalysis data. August started off with the nearly $200 million breach of cross-chain bridge Nomad, and an attack of Solana-based wallets drained at least $5 million in cryptocurrency.  Crypto protocol audits typically include two to three auditors scouring the code over a few weeks. Sherlock, which sells its solutions directly to protocols, starts with one or two senior auditors taking a brief look at the code. Sherlock then hosts an auditing competition where entrants are financially rewarded for finding vulnerabilities. The auditors come from a list of people that Sherlock has worked with before, but approved auditors will eventually include the top contest performers, explained Sanford.  Sherlock recently launched an incentive program for investors who want to stake assets to the auditing protocol. Stakers can receive 10% annual percentage yield (APY) on the USDC stablecoin, plus 5% APY on the native SHER token, which has yet to begin trading.  The new capital will be used to build out the team and to fund outside audits on the Sherlock platform, said Sanford. Other participants in the funding round included digital asset management group Spartan and crypto-focused venture capital firms Lattice and CoinFund. Last month, CoinFund launched a $300 million fund to make early-stage investments in Web3 projects.

The Ethereum network is set to switch its consensus algorithm sometime on Thursday, which will eliminate the need for miners. Some in the community were proposing that the network forks to continue using the PoW method of validating transactions. Ethermine, however, decided not to ""offer a dedicated mining pool for any of the planned Ethereum PoW forks,"" the pool said in a Wednesday post.  Once the switch happens, PoW mining won't be possible on Ethermine, as ""all Ethermine stratum servers will be shut down"" and the pool will switch to withdraw-only mode, the pool said.  Ethermine users can use other affiliated servers to mine ethereum classic, an older PoW token. Users will also be able to mine ravencoin (RVN), ergo (ERGO) and beam (BEAM).

By then, Ethereum will have transitioned to PoS, a major blow to PoW miners in the network. The Merge will force PoW miners that operate the $19 billion mining business to find alternatives. Source: https://watcher.guru/ethmerge Recent data shows that Ethereum miners are fleeing from the network. Right now, the average computing power of the whole Ethereum network stands at 854 TH/s. Trending downwards during the past week, the figure has dropped by about 19% from the peak in May. Ethereum&apos;s massive PoW hashrate is of great significance to the entire crypto mining industry, and the ETH hashrate will shift to other PoW coins once Ethereum shifts to PoS, which may reshape the whole mining sector. Facing the impending transformation of the mining sector, Ethereum miners might exclude themselves from the shift to PoS by the Ethereum community to protect their own interests. From this perspective, PoW miners on Ethereum might root for a hard fork to preserve the existing PoW chain and generate a new coin.

The diamond industry has historically struggled to attract investors, despite its allure for jewelry, mainly due to the lack of a uniform system for standardizing the value of the precious gem. Diamond Standard is aiming to change that by making Ethereum-based tokens that are backed by physical diamonds, which are standardized and tradeable on several exchanges.

That could help the token, which has daily trading volume of over $390 million across multiple crypto exchanges, data show, placing it among one of the most traded tokens but a fraction of ether's $22 billion daily volume.  Still, the network's popularity has been growing. Tron has added over $1.2 billion in value since June even as the value locked on DeFi markets on other blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana, has tapered off. In total, the ecosystem locks up over $5.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies, with the decentralized lending market JustLend holding over $3.3 billion alone.

42393796,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpB0Ij,1663155000,Monitoring the Merge: What a Successful Ethereum Upgrade Will Look Like,"All eyes in the cryptosphere are set on “the Merge,” Ethereum’s long-awaited update to a new, greener, method for processing transactions. The update, which will see the second-largest blockchain network ditch its power-hungry miners once and for all, is expected to take place around 15 hours after we hit “publish” on this article.  If you’re like us and are eager to follow along as the Merge approaches, there’s no need to be overwhelmed. Let us walk you through how we’ll be able to tell whether the upgrade was a success.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Timing of the Merge  Rather than a specific time, Ethereum’s Merge is scheduled around something called its Terminal Total Difficulty number – a value representing the cumulative difficulty of all blocks that have ever been mined under the network’s proof-of-work system.  The TTD number has been set at 58750000000000000000000, but you don’t need to do the math yourself in order to figure out what this means in human time.  To keep tabs on the Merge, one can bookmark websites like bordel.wtf and wenmerge.com, which both feature live estimates for when the upgrade will happen. Even easier, you can look up “When is the Ethereum Merge?” on Google, and you’ll be greeted with a big, fat countdown timer.  At press time, most estimates are placing the Merge around 4:23 UTC on Thursday – late into the evening (around midnight Thursday morning) if you are on the east coast of North America. (We only have an estimate because Ethereum proof-of-work blocks fluctuate in difficulty, and they aren’t issued at a set interval).  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  Block proposals  Ben Edgington, a product lead at the Ethereum research and development firm ConsenSys, told CoinDesk that the first thing he’ll be paying attention to when the Merge happens is whether or not blocks of transactions are being proposed to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake chain.  Recall that Ethereum is a decentralized ledger – a balance sheet that gets updated by a disintermediated community of volunteers, called “validators.” Every 12 seconds under Ethereum's new system, a validator will be randomly selected to propose a “block” to the chain – a list of transactions that it wants to write into the ledger.  “We expect a block like clockwork every 12 seconds on the proof-of-stake chain. Every ‘slot,’ which is a 12-second interval, a validator is chosen by the protocol to propose a block for that slot. If that validator is offline, is on a different fork, or is otherwise not participating correctly, then that block goes missing,” Edgington explained.  One can view this data on chain explorers like beaconcha.in or beaconscan.com. Both sites list every new slot as it happens, along with whether or not a block has been proposed for it.  “Immediately, we will ‘see empty slot, empty slot empty slot,’ and that would be the first sign of trouble. If we see ‘block, block, block, block, block,’ then we know we're good,” Edgington explained.  A few missed slots, according to Edgington, are “not immediately calls for desperate concern.”  Over the past few months, several Ethereum test networks (testnets) have undergone their own transitions from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake – each serving as a kind of dress rehearsal for the real thing.  “We have not yet had a completely flawless testnet merge,” recounted Edgington. “They've all had little bumps, small 10% or 20% reductions in the number of blocks. But very quickly, you know, within an hour people have fixed things and it's gone back up to normal levels, which is basically [a block] every 12 seconds.”  Participation rate  The next thing Edgington will be looking at post-Merge will be the network’s participation rate.  If a newly proposed block receives enough votes from the wider Ethereum community – called “attestations” – its transactions are written to the Ethereum ledger with the digital equivalent of a permanent marker.  “In contrast to the proof-of-work network, on proof of stake all of the validators participate all of the time – they're voting on [all] the blocks that they see,” explained Edgington. “We know we have [around] 420,000 validators, so we can count the votes and we can see how many are going missing. So we get a participation rate.”  Christine Kim, who created this newsletter before becoming a researcher at the investment firm Galaxy Digital, explained how one should look at participation rate in a recent piece she wrote about watching the Merge. (The piece is recommended reading for anyone looking for a deeper dive on monitoring the Merge after reading this newsletter.)  “[Participation rate] is particularly useful in getting a sense of the overall health of Ethereum as a [proof-of-stake] network,” Kim wrote. “A high participation rate from validators suggests that there is a strong probability epochs [big groups of slots] will be finalized without delay. A low participation rate, below the 2/3 threshold, suggests the opposite – that network finalization has a high likelihood of being delayed.”  Ethereum, in other words, will continue working so long as the participation rate sits above 66%, but the Beacon Chain – Ethereum's proof-of-stake staging area that will merge with its proof-of-work mainnet later tonight – usually has a participation that hovers around 99.5%. Again, one can monitor this number at beaconcha.in or beaconscan.com.  Finalization  As Kim hinted in her explanation of the importance of participation rate, the key indicator of a successful Merge will be when the network reaches finality.  Finality, explained Edginton, “is when the network collectively declares a block – a checkpoint in time in which it will never be reverted. We will never rewrite history before that point.” This, in other words, is when the transactions written to the new proof-of-stake ledger become irreversible.  “The point at which we pop the champagne is the point where we finalize the Merge checkpoint, which will be somewhere around 13 to 15 minutes post-Merge,” he added.  Why so many minutes? As Kim explained in her article, “Network finality on the Ethereum Beacon Chain is reached after 2 epochs are confirmed by at least 2/3 of active validators. An epoch is a period of time, 6.4 minutes, divided into 12-second intervals [ie. slots].”  The block explorer platforms we mentioned earlier, beaconcha.in and beaconscan.com, both list every epoch along with whether it has been finalized or not. Once Merge developers see two epochs finalized, one can only imagine the collective sigh of relief.

A research report from Bank of America said the Merge may lead to greater institutional adoption of ether.  WHY IT MATTERS: The notable reduction in energy consumption after the Merge may allow some institutional investors, who are barred from buying tokens that run on proof-of-work systems, to purchase ether (ETH) for the first time, the report said. “The ability to stake ETH and generate a higher-quality yield (lower credit and liquidity risk) as a validator or through a staking service rather than on block-box lending/borrowing applications may also drive institutional adoption,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.

42394747,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVQTb,1663151680,Binance CEO Zhao Says EU's Proposed Crypto Rules Are Fantastic But Strict,"PARIS – Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, founder and CEO of crypto exchange Binance, says the European Union's landmark Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is ""a little bit strict"" on stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets like gold or the U.S. dollar.  ""The drafts are not adopting USD-based stablecoins, which have 75% of the liquidity in the market,"" Zhao said at Binance Blockchain Week in Paris on Wednesday.  In June, EU lawmakers agreed to the main political points of MiCA, which will allow crypto companies to operate across the bloc's 27 member nations with a single license. Some in the industry are concerned that a legislative cap on stablecoins becoming widely used as a means of payment could constrain the market, particularly for assets not priced in euros.  Still, Zhao described MiCA as ""fantastic"" and said he expects it to be viewed as ""the global standard"" in crypto regulation for other jurisdictions to copy.  Zhao also said Paris is ""probably ... the financial hub for crypto in Europe and the larger part of the world,"" and he expects the industry in France to ""explode"" in the next five years, which will be helped by lower taxes and much easier employment laws.  France has historically had a highly regulated labor market compared with countries such as the U.K., U.S. and even many countries in the EU, making it more expensive for companies to hire and fire. President Emmanuel Macron has since 2017 set out a program to ease some of those costs, which trade unions oppose.  Zhao said that Binance has hired 150 people for its operations in Paris with plans to hire ""a couple of hundred more"" by the end of the year.  In May, the exchange was approved for registration as a digital asset service provider with France's capital market regulator. The registration permitted Binance to hold digital assets as a custodian, facilitate the purchase, sale and exchange of such assets and operate a trading platform for them.

42394746,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVQSc,1663150241,Russian Millionaire’s Startup Plans Ruble Stablecoin Following DAI Model,"Alexander Lebedev, the former owner of Russia’s National Standard Bank and publisher of U.K. newspapers The Independent and Evening Standard, is starting a new cryptocurrency project.  InDeFi – the decentralized finance (DeFi) startup he founded – plans to introduce a ruble-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain, co-founder and CEO Sergey Mendeleev said Wednesday at the Blockchain Life conference in Moscow.  Mendeleev, who is also founder of the Garantex crypto exchange, which is sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury, noted that the project has nothing to do with the Bank of Russia’s digital ruble. InDeFi’s crypto ruble will be decentralized, Mendeleev said. A trial version of the coin with minimal features is available for testing and feedback, he told CoinDesk.  The coin ""will not only make it easier for Russian citizens to access international cryptocurrency exchanges, but also, after changes in legislation, provide transactions with foreign counterparties via crypto,” Mendeleev said on stage.  Following the model of MakerDAO’s DAI algorithmic stablecoin, issuance of crypto rubles will be performed by a decentralized smart contract with overcollateralization. In MakerDAO’s system, users lock ether in a smart contract and take out loans in DAI. The loans are backed by the ether collateral locked in the smart contract escrow.  One InDeFi token will be equal one ruble, Mendeleev said.  InDeFi was launched last year by Lebedev and Mendeleev as a facility offering loans in stablecoins. Lebedev, a former officer in the Soviet Union’s KGB secret service, fell out of favor with President Vladimir Putin’s regime in 2008 after a small Russian newspaper he owned published a story saying Putin had an affair with the Olympic champion gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Lebedev lost both his banking and publishing businesses in the country.  In an exclusive interview to CoinDesk in April, Lebedev said he has been studying fraud in traditional banking and viewed crypto as a way to bypass the corrupt mainstream banking system.  In a comment to CoinDesk, Mendeleev said that InDeFi hasn't been performing well recently, just “like any other DeFi project on the falling market.” It is “looking for new forms [of business] and apps.”  “Just imagine, it would be as easy to trade ruble on DEXes as USDT, for example,” he said, referring to decentralized crypto exchanges and tether, the largest dollar stablecoin by market cap.",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | DAI,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/14/russian-millionaires-startup-plans-ruble-stablecoin-following-dai-model,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca042ce12b4468140e86380625afd39edf4be6c6-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Early Wednesday, the funding rate or cost of holding bullish/bearish (long/short) bets in the ether perpetual futures listed on the leading crypto exchange Binance was at its most negative since May 2021, as seen in the featured image. The average funding rate across major exchanges, including Binance, fell to record lows, according to data tracked by Coinalyze.  In other words, the compensation paid by shorts to longs to keep their positions open has spiked and reached the highest level in 16 months on Binance, reflecting excessive demand for bets on potential price declines.  Collected from traders every eight hours, the funding rate helps keep the perpetual futures prices in sync with the underlying asset's price in the spot market. Perpetuals are futures contracts with no expiry, allowing traders to bypass the so-called rollover costs incurred in the regular futures market while switching from the front-month contract to the next month's contract at the time of settlement.  The ETH shorts have become expensive, seemingly because traders are deploying a bevy of strategies to profit from and protect against volatility that might stem from the impending change in the way Ethereum blockchain verifies transactions.  ""Some traders appear to hedge their [bullish spot market] exposure in case there are any technical issues with the Merge and/or in expectations that there will be a large profit-taking by long positions into the event,"" Markus Thielen, chief investment officer at British Virgin Islands-based IDEG Asset Management, said.  While the probability of the Merge failing is relatively low, ether's price could drop after the upgrade for two reasons. First, ether has gained nearly 55% in the two months leading up to the Merge in a classic ""buy-the-rumor"" type move, and so some profit-taking may be seen after the Merge. Further, ether may not immediately become a deflationary currency with depreciating supply after the Merge, disappointing those positioned for that supposedly bullish effect to kick in right away.  Another reason for shorts becoming too expensive is increased interest in selling perpetual futures and regular futures against long positions in the spot market. The so-called market-neutral trade, which would allow ETH holders to collect potential Ethereum fork token ETHPOW for free while bypassing the risks of any volatility in ether's price, has been quite popular among traders since early August.  ""ETH funding rates have been persistently negative for over a month now, likely as a result of investors hedging their risk exposure to ETH by going short perpetual futures,"" analysts at Paris-based Kaiko wrote in the weekly newsletter, explaining the growing divergence between ETH and BTC funding rates.  Short squeeze ahead?  Extreme bearish positioning, as represented by elevated fees to hold shorts, might pave the way for a short squeeze – a sudden and rapid spike due to traders unwinding their bearish bets.  The funding rate is essentially the cost of leverage and becomes a burden when the market moves against expectations, forcing traders to liquidate their positions.  Should ether remain flat or bounce after the Merge, traders holding shorts may square off their bets, pushing ether higher.  ""The short bias of these trades leaves the market primed for a potential short squeeze, something which we have seen follow the last three times funding has been deeply negative,"" the Kaiko analysts noted.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/14/merge-focused-hedging-makes-ether-shorts-most-expensive-in-16-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9dee3fd9f2df3b6cc920a1f4432b7cfaf28fdfb3-1375x1042.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Frontrunners Don Bolduc, a former military officer, and Chuck Morse, president of the New Hampshire State Senate, were still neck and neck at 3:46 a.m. Eastern time, separated by only 1% with 82% of precincts reporting, with Bolduc leading by a nose. They are competing to face incumbent Sen. Maggie Hasan (D-N.H.) in November.  Fenton's loss comes as the 2022 primary season wraps up. In addition to New Hampshire, the states of Delaware and Rhode Island held their primary elections Tuesday to close out the final preliminary leg of the midterm elections. The general U.S. election will be held on Tuesday, Nov. 8.  Fenton, in a Twitter post, thanked his supporters.  Despite Fenton's loss, the U.S. Senate may soon have more crypto-friendly lawmakers after this year's midterm. U.S. Representative Ted Budd (R-N.C.) won his primary bid for a seat in the upper house of the American legislature in June. He'll face Democrat Cheri Beasley in the November contest. Similarly, Blake Masters, a Peter Thiel-backed Republican, is competing against incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, in Arizona, while Ohio has Rep. Tim Ryan (D) facing challenger J.D. Vance (R).  Budd, a three-term congressman, has introduced or supported a number of crypto-friendly bills over his time in office. However,few have actually become law.  Seats in the House and Senate are up for grabs this November, and though a seemingly record number of crypto-friendly candidates ran for office it ultimately was not much of an election issue. Several crypto-friendly candidates – and several candidates supported by the crypto industry – lost their primary races over the course of the year.  Rather, the U.S. economy, gun policies, voting policies, healthcare and crime were at the top of voters' minds this year, according to a Pew Research Center poll published in August.

42394774,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVTAr,1663145040,"Steep Drops in Bitcoin, Ether Cause Over $250M in Futures Losses","Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) both fell below their recent support levels in the past 24 hours in moves that caused over $250 million in liquidations, according to data from Coinglass. The crypto markets followed a drop in U.S. equities after the release of higher-than-expected inflation readings for August.  Futures tracking bitcoin lost upward of $130 million, while ether futures lost $125 million. Ethereum classic (ETC) futures saw over $10 million in losses – an unusual figure for the asset – amid recent trading interest in the tokens.  Bitcoin fell 9% in the past 24 hours, the most among major cryptocurrencies, while ether dropped 6%, CoinDesk data shows. Ether dropped to as low as $1,560 during late U.S. hours on Tuesday, before recovering to as much as $1,622 during Asian morning hours on Wednesday.  The sudden drop on Tuesday night was prompted by traders reacting to higher-than-expected consumer price index numbers.  Elsewhere, XRP dropped 8%, solana’s SOL fell 7%, and cardano’s ADA declined 7.5%. Outside of major cryptocurrencies, cosmos’s ATOM fell 11%, ApeCoin’s APE dropped 12%, and luna classic (LUNC) dropped 14%, continuing slides from earlier this week.  Data suggests part of the price volatility on ether futures came as funding rates surged to yearly highs of nearly 0.15%, as analytics firm Coinalyze noted on Twitter.  Funding rates are periodic payments made by traders based on the difference between prices in the futures and spot markets. Depending on their open positions, traders will either pay or receive funding.  The payments ensure there are always participants on both sides of the trade. Participants use sophisticated strategies to collect funding rates while hedging losses due to price movements – which creates market dynamics that contribute to price volatility.  Meanwhile, some markets analysts told CoinDesk that bitcoin is losing its appeal as a potential “inflation hedge.""  “In countries where currency depreciation has been greatest, such as Japan, where the dollar to the yen has gained more than 20% since the beginning of the year, bitcoin has lost 35% of its value,” currency trader Daniel Kostecki of investment company Conotoxia said in a Telegram message.  “Against the Korean won, the dollar has appreciated 15% since the beginning of the year, while the BTC/KRW exchange rate has fallen more than 40% in that time,” Kostecki remarked, adding that “even gold was not been able to counter current inflationary trends.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETC | LUNC,BTC | ETC | LUNC | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/14/steep-drop-in-bitcoin-ether-causes-over-250m-in-futures-losses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/413b4b03b4bda050817107f012b4a2d783843339-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dealing in real estate typically involves interacting with an intermediary, swimming through paperwork, and paying steep fees and commissions. Even with the latest advancements in technology, many jurisdictions still require real estate buyers and sellers to show up in person to execute their documents. Most often, this is due to notaries being required to see people physically sign documents, and while some notaries can do this task virtually, not all have the same capabilities. Now, with the help of cryptocurrency (specifically NFTs and smart contracts), the trajectory of real estate transactions is rapidly changing. We&apos;re talking about taking out the middleman and obtaining and transferring ownership with ease. Sales can even be made through sites similar to eBay, but with a new level of added security. In this writing, we will be specifically focusing on crypto&apos;s effect on the luxury real estate market. But first, let&apos;s start with the basics—how NFTs and smart contracts work. What is an NFT? NFTs, short for non-fungible tokens, are cryptographic tokens that can come in the form of many things (e.g., music, drawings, videos). Each NFT is 100% unique and cannot be replicated or replaced. Many times, NFTs represent digital ownership of something, such as a piece of digital art.

The unidentified man was held in Veenendaal, about 35 miles southeast of Amsterdam, and was released on Sept. 8. He remains a suspect and his crypto has been seized, Dutch cyber police said in a Tuesday statement.  “Cryptocurrency, like ordinary money, is vulnerable to all kinds of crime,” the police said. “The anonymous and cross-border nature of cryptocurrency affords opportunities for criminals.”  According to the police, the suspect had laundered tens of millions of euros (tens of millions of U.S. dollars) and had sought to cover his tracks using privacy coin monero (XMR) and decentralized exchange Bisq. He was identified through bitcoin (BTC) transactions.  In a bid to curb money laundering, the European Union recently passed new measures to make it harder to stay anonymous when using crypto.

The warrant included five additional individuals, Bloomberg News reported, citing a text message from the prosecutors' office. They are charged with violating the Capital Markets Act, the report said.  The warrant comes four months after the collapse of the $40 billion Terra ecosystem and its algorithmic stablecoin (UST), which was the first domino to fall in this year's crypto winter.  The contagion that followed caused an industry-wide fallout, with crypto lender Celsius Network and crypto broker Voyager Digital filing for bankruptcy as the value of digital assets slumped by more than 50% from their highs.  Singapore-based hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was another firm that filed for bankruptcy after the extent of its exposure to the Terra network was exposed. The implosion of Three Arrows left a trail of troubled loans across the crypto industry, with billions being owed to creditors.  In his first public interview last month, Kwon had maintained that he is cooperating with authorities.  Terra didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Kwon also reiterated his commitment to the Terra ecosystem and its re-launched terra token (LUNA). The token has slumped by 16.7% over the past hour.

On the weekly time frame, the Bitcoin (BTC) price action shows a double bottom at the $18850 support level. Given that the price has recovered twice from this level in the last three months, it serves as crucial base support. However, can the recent sell-off prevent Bitcoin holders from achieving their profits? Key Points: The Bitcoin price action shows a double bottom pattern in the weekly chart. The reversal from the $18,85 level fails to sustain above the $21,875 mark. The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $51.36 billion.

The CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky, with the head of innovation and chief compliance officer, Oren Blonstein, allegedly set up the Kelvin project.

Mashinsky made the declaration during an employee meeting on September 8, when the firm considered potential possibilities after declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July.

Here's Where to Go,"The Ethereum Merge is becoming an occasion for celebration on top of all the speculation.  Ethereum, the second-biggest blockchain network, is scheduled to transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) a little after 12:30 a.m. ET, 5:30 a.m. BST, or 12:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and Singapore.  For HODLers of ether (ETH), and users of the Ethereum protocol, this is a monumental shift that had been years in the making. As PoW cryptocurrencies are routinely criticized for being energy intensive, one of the major benefits of this transition will be a stark reduction in the network’s energy usage to the tune of 99.95% according to the Ethereum Foundation.  Even though the Merge will take place overnight for most in North America and Europe, the event itself has a festival-like feel to it, a sort of Super Bowl but with more brains than brawn.  The crypto-finance newsletter Bankless aggregated a list of no fewer than six Ethereum Merge watch parties, mostly virtual but a few being held in real life.  The Merge watch parties  For those who want to stay up and party with their fellow HODLers, below is a list of live stream watch parties:  Bankless: The eve of the Merge Livestream (Sept. 14, 5 p.m. ET)  Ethereum Foundation: Ethereum Merge viewing party (Sept. 14, 11 p.m. ET)  The Boston DAO Ethereum Merge Soiree     And for those at EthBerlin in Germany, conference organizers have put together an in-real-life launch party kicking off that evening.

The hotly anticipated August consumer price index (CPI) arrived at an unexpectedly high 8.3%, and investors – crypto and otherwise – didn't like what they saw.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading just above $20,400, a more than 7% decline from 24 hours earlier. BTC, which had been hovering well over $22,500 just before the release of the report, plunged over 5% in the hour after the CPI release and kept spiraling.  Ether, the second-biggest crypto in market value, followed a similar pattern and was changing hands under $1,600, a roughly 6% decline from a day earlier as inflation worries trumped Merge excitement. The Merge, the shifting of the Ethereum blockchain from a slower, more energy sapping proof-of-work protocol to proof-of-stake is supposed to occur Thursday, although recent ETH activity, even before the disappointing CPI, has suggested that the most significant price increases have already occurred.  Other major altcoins spent the day in a deep red funk with SOL and AVAX recently off more than 12% and 9%, respectively.  ""Struggling is the right word,"" Raghu Yarlagadda, co-founder and CEO of FalconX, told CoinDesk TV. ""People weren't expecting 8.3%.""  Yarlagadda said the August CPI, which economic observers had expected to sink to 8.1%, offered the latest evidence that inflation remained a threat to the U.S. economy, and that the Federal Reserve would be more inclined to raise interest rates a third consecutive time by 75 basis points at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week.  ""[The] Fed was very clear that they're gonna fight inflation first and then prioritize the soft landing,"" he said. ""What that means is that it's going to be making some aggressive moves."" He added: ""The inflation data will probably create some drag on risk-on assets, and that's going to spill over into crypto.""  As they've largely done in recent months, crypto prices dovetailed with equity markets, which also tumbled on Tuesday. The technology-heavy Nasdaq, the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average struggled through their worst day since June 2020 with the Nasdaq plunging more than 5%. Market observers had expected falling energy prices to spur a more favorable CPI, but food and housing costs remain stubbornly high.  Crypto news  The executive exodus from cryptocurrency hedge fund and venture-capital investor Pantera Capital continued with Chief Financial Officer Ryan Davis leaving, as CoinDesk's Nick Baker reported Tuesday. His departure follows the exit of Chief Technical Officer Terence Schofield, Chief Operating Officer Samir Shah and other employees.  Earlier in the day, lawyers for Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist best known for claiming to be the inventor of Bitcoin, said he will not provide any new cryptographic proof that he is Satoshi Nakamoto during his trial against Bitcoiner Hodlonaut, which began in Oslo on Monday.  Meanwhile, Yarlagadda noted that financial institutions have been strongly opinionated about the Merge's impact on pricing with some seeing it as a ""starting point for something bigger,"" but others believing increases last month already accounted for the change. ""Both sides are extremely passionate, but I don't think there is strong conviction that ETH is going to be rallying right after the Merge,"" he said. ""Retail seems to be on both sides of the fence at this point, based on what we're seeing.""

California’s new digital assets bill which singles out stablecoins and currently awaits Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature could reshape the world’s digital asset industry, given the state’s size and importance in the cryptocurrency industry.  Or will it?  The crypto industry has been shifting dramatically since New York, another U.S. state of outsized importance, passed a BitLicense bill in 2015 that has set a precedent for state-level, crypto rules and led to New York Attorney General’s probe into Tether and a settlement.  California dreamin’  Although federal legislative interest remains in stablecoins, a first iteration of the STABLE Act, which would provide rules for stablecoin issuers, died in the halls of power. But the passing of California’s Digital Assets Law threatens to fundamentally change the stablecoin environment.  The law, passed almost unanimously last month by California’s state assembly, would prohibit California-licensed entities from dealing with stablecoins, unless that stablecoin is fully backed by securities and issued by a bank or is licensed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.  But one of the minds behind the STABLE Act, is skeptical about how much meaningful difference this law will make.  “I feel like this is a state-level thing dealing with a federal-level problem,” Rohan Grey, a legal scholar who helped draft the STABLE Act, told CoinDesk. “The fact that this is a state-level bill still creates some limitations. They do not have the capacity to, for example, require FDIC insurance.”  The reliance on full asset backing of stablecoins is not necessarily going to be as safe as deposit insurance, Grey says.  Grey highlights how California’s bill is actually a step back from what was before Congress as it gives an option for stablecoin issuance from entities that aren’t banks – whereas the STABLE Act specifically requires chartered banks to play a role.  “We are trying to actually make sure that that bank perimeter is strongly enforced, whereas this allows someone to be potentially licensed as a stablecoin issuer without being classified as a bank,” Grey said. “One of the not as widely reported but second order and subtle goals of that was to re-absorb the money transmitter industry into banks.”  While tether (USDT), given its market cap, is often at the forefront of legislation around stablecoins, and as a result creates a stark divide between exchanges that can and can’t offer tether (see: Binance/FTX.us versus their mothership), Grey thinks that it’s important to look beyond bad actors and consider broader market safety.  “For the people [the] behind STABLE Act, this is not a problem about individual bad actors; this is a problem about actually the structure of the market and the structure of the theory of safety,” he said. “If your theory of safety is, ‘We'll always have some assets on hand. That will be good enough,’ then you're leaving out operational risk. You can be hacked. Something could go wrong. You're not covering that.”  Crypto moves faster than legislators  Even if California Gov. Newsom signs the bill into law this week, it won’t come into effect until 2025 based on the bill’s wording.  “This is highly likely to be way outdated and possibly inapplicable by the time we get to 2025,” Chris Lavigne, co-chair of the digital assets group at New York-based law firm Withers, told CoinDesk. “By 2025, I suspect the regulatory regime will have dramatically changed, and so I don't know to what extent this bill will become outdated and the laws in it will become outdated.”  Lavigne, like Grey, also takes issue with California doing something that’s more logical for the federal government to handle.  “This notion that they're going to prohibit California-licensed entities dealing with stablecoins unless it's issued by a bank licensed by California is a wildly aggressive position,” he said. “It would prohibit effectively most exchanges from either operating in California or the companies would have to cordon off or geofence people in California or not offer some of the digital assets that are on their exchanges, for example, in California.”  A bill that may ripple widely  Despite Asia’s large growing pools of liquidity, the U.S. remains the most important market for digital assets. At the end of the day, this complicates things much like how exchanges and protocols without meaningful exposure to the U.S. must be cognizant of New York’s rules, especially as these rules are more stringent.  “This creates a situation where California is trying to create some sort of standalone regime where in order to play ball in the United States, you have to first satisfy California regulators,” Lavigne said.  But who knows where we’ll be in 2025. Maybe by then, bitcoin will have gone down to $0.  Important events  Future Proof Festival (Huntington Beach, Calif.)

42393781,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAyyf,1663114374,"Craig Wright Won’t Give Cryptographic Proof He’s Satoshi, His Lawyers Say at Hodlonaut Trial","OSLO, Norway — Lawyers for Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist best known for claiming to be the inventor of Bitcoin, said he will not provide any new cryptographic proof that he is Satoshi Nakamoto during his trial against bitcoiner Hodlonaut. The trial kicked off here on Monday.  The Norwegian trial is one of two simultaneous lawsuits centered around a series of tweets from March 2019 in which Hodlonaut expressed doubt about Wright’s claims to be Satoshi, and called him a “fraud” and a “scammer.” Hodlonaut, known in real life as Magnus Granath, initiated the lawsuit in Norway to get a judge to rule that his tweets were protected by the constitutional right to freedom of speech, and prevent Wright’s defamation suit filed in the U.K. from moving forward.  During his opening statements on Tuesday, Wright’s lead attorney, Halvor Manshaus, told the court that establishing Wright’s ownership of Satoshi’s private keys – a move many of Wright’s doubters say would settle the years-long argument over his claims – isn’t enough.  “Craig Wright is of the perception that to sign … with the private key, one block or the other … is not conclusive evidence of whether he is Satoshi or not,” Manshaus told the court. “It’s never one thing or the other is sufficient, you need several elements, you need the whole package.”  Manshaus also read numerous excerpts from Andrew O’Hagan’s 2016 article “The Satoshi Affair” to show that, in addition to not feeling like cryptographic evidence would be enough to silence his critics, Wright has also struggled emotionally with the burden of “proving” his identity as Satoshi.  Using passages from “The Satoshi Affair,” Manshaus argued that Wright has “difficulty trusting people” and suffered extreme emotional pain and “exhaustion” after a private signing session – intended to prove his ownership of Satoshi’s private keys – with Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen in 2016, that caused him to break down in tears.  Determining ‘Satoshiness’ without cryptographic proof  Instead of cryptographic proof, Manshaus attempted to convince the court of his client’s identity as Satoshi with other pieces of evidence, including a personal history allegedly in line with the creation of Bitcoin. Manshaus’ opening statements also leaned heavily on Andresen’s 2016 assertions that he believed Wright to be Satoshi following the private signing session.  What Manshaus glossed over, however, is that Andresen later retracted his support for Wright: When Andresen was deposed for Wright’s trial against the estate of his former friend Dave Kleiman, he testified that he had been “bamboozled” by Wright, who used “gobbledegook proof” to demonstrate his possession of Satoshi’s private keys.  The support of former Bitcoin Foundation Director Jon Matonis – who wrote a blog post called “How I Met Satoshi” in 2016 after a private proof session with Wright – also featured heavily in Wright’s legal team’s opening statements.  Convincing the likes of Matonis and Andresen, Manshaus argued, the latter of which he described as “a very critical person in the beginning … extremely critical,” was proof enough of Wright’s claim to be Satoshi.  In addition to the “proof” Wright offered privately, Manshaus detailed Wright’s childhood in Australia, during which he spent time with his grandfather, Captain Ronald Lynam, learning to code and operate a ham radio in the family “hamshack.”  Manshaus also told the court about Wright’s long-standing obsession with Japanese culture (confirmed by a quote from Wright’s mother in “The Satoshi Affair”) that explained his choice of pseudonym.  Satoshi, Manshaus said, means “Ash” in Japanese – and Wright chose it because he wanted Bitcoin to take down the legacy financial system, and “rise like a phoenix from its ashes.” It had the added benefit, according to Manshaus, of being the Japanese-language name of Pokemon character Ash Ketchum. (Note: CoinDesk attempted to verify this claim, and found that Satoshi has several meanings, depending on the kanji used, none of which translate to “Ash.” Furthermore, the Japanese name for Ash Ketchum is based on Pokemon creator Satoshi Taijiri’s name, according to gaming website CBR. The spelling Taijiri uses for “Satoshi” translates to “knowledge” or “wisdom.”)  Wright’s academic achievements and military career – both of which appear to have been exaggerated (for example, Australian public military records seem to indicate that Wright was discharged by the Royal Australian Air Force only a year after being accepted into a nine-year officer program) – were also presented to the court as evidence that Wright had the skills, knowledge and experience required to create Bitcoin.  KPMG report  During their opening statements on Monday, Hodlonaut’s attorneys told the court they’d commissioned multinational auditing firm KPMG to authenticate Wright’s evidence submitted in the case. The report is expected to show that many documents submitted by Wright are either manipulated or unverifiable, and will be discussed when a KPMG representative testifies on Friday.  Though the contents of the 73-exhibit report have not yet been made public, Wright’s attorneys attempted to preemptively debunk it during their statements on Tuesday, telling the court that there are reasons for documents to appear manipulated (such as being opened in two different versions of Microsoft Word) that don’t necessarily point to intentional manipulation.  The current trial in Norway is not the first time Wright’s alleged history of submitting false evidence has influenced court proceedings.  In the Kleiman vs. Wright trial held in November, lawyers for the plaintiff called witnesses who testified about Wright’s business dealings, suspected forged signatures and backdated documents. They also referenced Wright’s legal issues with the Australian Tax Office (ATO), who concluded after a lengthy investigation that Wright had backdated and forged contracts provided during an audit, and was pretending to be Satoshi to get around his tax issues (Wright, for his part, claimed that the ATO was the victim of a hack that resulted in funky documents).

By using a hashtag, Manshaus argued, Hodlonaut amplified his criticisms of Wright by creating a repository for similar tweets using the same hashtag.  “His statement directly encourages other people to follow up the attack against Craig Wright with the same language, the same form,” Manshaus said. “We are going to see that encouraged a rapid and toxic attack against Craig Wright.”  Manshaus told the court that when Wright complained to Twitter about the hashtag and subsequent criticism, his account was deleted.  He also said that the online criticism of Wright spilled over into other social media platforms, including a Telegram group called “Bitcoin Plebs” that encouraged its approximately 400 members to “organize a bitcoin pleb attack on some s**tcoin scammers,” which included putting “pressure on exchanges to delist these scams.”  Manshaus admitted there was no evidence that Hodlonaut was involved in this Telegram group, but told the court:  “Could be that Holdonaut has nothing to do with these people except they see the tweet and react … but still, we believe that it’s as likely or more likely that Hodlonaut himself is more involved than that, that he’s in one of these groups, that he’s taking the initiative here …”  Manshaus went on to say that the “BSV extinction event” (referring to the massive delisting of Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision, the fork of Bitcoin created by Wright) the members of “Bitcoin Plebs” were angling for was a result – direct or indirect – of Hodlonaut’s criticism.  The exchanges that delisted BSV, however, including Binance and Kraken, stated they did so because of Wright’s behavior, including doxxing and suing Hodlonaut and others.  Witness testimony begins  With opening statements concluded, witness testimony will begin on Wednesday. Wright and Hodlonaut are both expected to testify.  On Thursday and Friday, the court will hear testimony from additional witnesses: Wright’s cousin, Max Lynam; a so-far unnamed expert from KPMG who will go over the findings of the report; Dr. Ami Klin, an autism expert who diagnosed Wright with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and testified on his behalf at the Kleiman vs. Wright trial last year; and Stefan Matthews, an associate of Wright’s.
