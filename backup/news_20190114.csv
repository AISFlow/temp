42402437,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqiw,1547503224,Fee Spike on Ethereum Classic Raises Fears of More Exchange Attacks,"A sudden surge in transaction fees on the ethereum classic blockchain has some developers speculating whether cryptocurrency exchanges could be at risk of attack, a development that follows last week's 51% attack in which more than $200,000 was stolen from at least one exchange.  Over the last 24 hours, average transaction fees on the blockchain rose to $6.10, up nearly 800 percent from $0.71 the day prior, the largest spike in transaction costs in the history of the blockchain according to data source BitInfoCharts.  As such, ethereum classic miners made as much as 844 ETC (or roughly $3,600) verifying transaction blocks Sunday, an unusual occurrence for the network that continues to run the original software instance of the ethereum project.  However, the uptick is one of several clues leading developers to think this may be evidence an attacker is using a known exploit to target certain cryptocurrency exchanges.  Starting as early at 11:15 AM (UTC) Sunday, one user on the ethereum classic Discord channel reported a near doubling of the hash power, or total computer power, being put toward verifying transactions and mining new blocks, a figure corroborated on blockchain analytics sites such as CoinWarz.  Another data source, GasTracker, said ethereum classic mining pool 2miners accounted for a large majority of the additional hashrate hitting up to 3,054.29 GH/s from a rough average shortly beforehand of 160 GH/s.  Though no one is able to identify who exactly is sending transactions with such high fees, there is speculation over this individual’s motives.  Tweeting out a link identifying a known vulnerability in ethereum gas tokens, Burns posits that the sender of these transactions is looking to take advantage a loophole that enables gas token creation through exchanges free of cost.  As background, GasToken is an application created last year that allows users to store and sell “gas” – the fees charged by the network for all operations, such as computing smart contracts. This comes in handy for users looking to save on costs for operations by enabling them to tokenize gas and store it when network fees are low or sell them when prices are high.  An exploit discovered by smart contract development startup Level K last October revealed that cryptocurrency exchanges who don’t place a limit on gas usage may end up being drained of funds by attackers minting new gas tokens.  Burns explained to CoinDesk:  “An exploit was found a few months ago where exchanges were paying [gas] for the exchange withdrawal. Unknown users were using this to withdraw and minting gas tokens for free [by] having the exchanges pay large amounts of gas.”  Mystery Continues  Some experts, including ethereum classic developer Yaz Khoury, agree with Burn's analysis that this may be a GasToken exploit. But others aren’t so sure.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Anthony Lusardi explained that from a glance at Sunday’s incident, it looks to him as though “someone bought some hashrate to mine blocks and then other addresses made very high-value transactions.”  He added it’s unclear at the moment whether any money actually moved through exchanges, suggesting the activity may not be indicative of any GasToken exploit.  Similarly, founder and CEO of Bitfly – which runs the ethereum classic mining pool Ethermine – Peter Pratscher told CoinDesk:  “I don’t think the high transaction fees are related to the GasToken exploit … It is unknown if this was a mistake or an intentional measure to subsidize ETC mining pool and prevent further 51% attacks.”  This meaning that the hike in transaction fees could be thought of as a positive to the overall security of the network should they continue and actually attract more miner support to the network. Pratscher added that from the transactions he's analyzed thus far, all ""are standard A to B value transfers that do not interact with a [smart] contract.""  Indeed, the ethereum classic community is still left with many questions to answer after events last week caused massive block reorganizations.  One of the most harmful consequences of last week's attack is that cryptocurrency exchanges have reported lost funds.  Yet, on an optimistic note, exchange Gate.io reported this weekend that about half of the money (about $100k worth) lost was returned. Since then, Gate.io says it's taking extra precautions to secure users funds.  After having raised block confirmation times to 500 last Tuesday, the confirmation number now is 4,000 indicating a significantly longer wait period for users sending ethereum classic funds through the exchange.

42402434,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqgy,1547488882,Stablecoin Issuer TrustToken Adds Feature to Ease Wallet Management,"Crypto startup TrustToken has launched a new address management feature for companies that use the TrueUSD stablecoin.  The company announced Monday that exchanges which list the dollar-pegged token can more easily manage client deposits with AutoSweep, which allows an exchange to provide each of its clients a unique deposit address. Each of these deposit addresses is matched to the exchange's central wallet.  These aliases can be thought of as similar to having multiple email addresses on the same domain, and TrustToken says any single central wallet may be able to utilize as many as 1 million deposit addresses.  Terry Li, a software engineer with TrustToken, told CoinDesk that the new feature is not just aimed at exchanges, but can also benefit merchants or other companies trading with TrueUSD, explaining:  ""There's a few benefits to this, it’s much cheaper for exchanges to [use], they don’t need to run a lot of transactions to aggregate all these users’ tokens into their hot wallet, so that’s one thing ... It’s also less key management, [companies] wouldn’t need to manage all the private keys.""  This last factor, in particular, may aid merchants and users more than exchanges, he noted.  Once deployed, the end user will not see any difference in their experience.  In a statement, TrustToken head of product and engineering Rafael Cosman added that the feature will reduce gas costs for exchanges, referring to the tiny amounts of ether required to power transactions on the ethereum blockchain.  ""AutoSweep is the first implementation of an ‘alias’ feature for an ethereum-based token and allows exchanges to significantly improve both the accounting structure and save on time and gas cost by automatically sweeping user accounts to the central wallet,"" he said.  The code underpinning the feature is open-source, and can be applied to any ERC-20 token, said David Steinbruck, the marketing communications manager at TrustToken.

42402431,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqfz,1547487002,How the US Government Shutdown Is Halting Crypto Progress on Wall Street,"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is hurting the crypto industry, too.  As the impasse in Washington stretches into its record-breaking fourth week, the closure of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has put key developments – namely, the approval and launch of products and services involving cryptocurrencies – on hold.  Notably, the launch of Bakkt's bitcoin futures market was delayed in part by the company's inability to secure approvals before Dec. 22, 2018, when the shutdown began. The platform, created by Intercontinental Exchange (parent of the New York Stock Exchange), is in a holding pattern until regulators can open a 30-day public comment period. A new launch date for the platform, which most recently was set for Jan. 24, has yet to be announced.  This lack of approval has not deterred Bakkt from building up its platform: the company announced Monday it was acquiring parts of independent futures commission merchant Rosenthal Collins Group (RCG) to bolster its regulatory compliance chops.  ""We made great progress in December,"" Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler wrote in post published on Medium on New Year's Eve, ""and we'll continue to onboard customers as we await the 'green light.'""  Other startups are in a similar state of limbo.  ErisX, a trading platform that recently raised $27.5 million from prominent investors, is also waiting for furloughed federal employees to return to work. The platform aims to be a regulated futures market and clearinghouse, which requires approval from the CFTC.  ""ErisX's interaction with the CFTC has been both positive and productive,"" CEO Thomas Chippas told CoinDesk, adding:  ""During this government shutdown we have continued our platform development efforts. We look forward to this current impasse being resolved and re-engaging with [CFTC] staff on our DCO [derivatives clearing organization] application.""  When ETF?  Exchanges aside, even certain products are now potentially at risk.  Perhaps one of the most highly anticipated bitcoin-related products is an exchange-traded fund, or ETF. The SEC currently has one rule change proposal sitting before it, filed by VanEck, SolidX and Cboe.  The proposal has already been delayed a number of times, and now faces a final deadline of Feb. 27. If the SEC does nothing, under existing law, the proposal would be approved. Specifically, Title 15 of the U.S. Code states that any proposed rule changes ""shall be deemed to have been approved by the [SEC] if … the [SEC] does not issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change.""  However, some legal experts say an approval-by-default is unlikely to happen, even if the shutdown drags on.  Ethan Silver, chair of the broker-dealer practice at law firm Lowenstein Sandler, anticipates that, should the shutdown continue, any staffers who remain on duty would reject the application.  ""I think if they were forced to deal with it, they would sooner deny it than be put in a position [where it is approved on a technicality],"" he said, explaining that the regulator would likely cite ""market integrity"" or a similar emergency contingency as a reason for the denial.  Similarly, Jake Chervinsky, a lawyer with Kobre & Kim, said on Twitter that the SEC would likely find some way to reject the proposal during a protracted shutdown, a view also shared by attorney David Silver of the Silver Miller law firm.  The commission has yet to approve any crypto ETFs, rejecting nearly a dozen in 2018. That has not yet deterred companies from trying to be the first to bring such a fund to market, however. Just last week, Bitwise Asset Management announced its intention to launch a bitcoin ETF with NYSE Arca.  While the company has filed an initial registration form, NYSE Arca has not yet submitted the rule change proposal, and so the SEC cannot yet consider the ETF.  Please advise  Beyond launches, the crypto space – at least in the U.S. – is still waiting for increased clarity and official guidance on how to safely handle digital assets.  Vince Molinari, co-founder of the regulated trading platform Templum, told CoinDesk that initiatives the SEC may have planned, such as guidance on custody, are likely to be delayed.  ""I think the entire space gets pushed back,"" he said. ""It could be a quarter or two before things go back, it could be longer depending on how long the shutdown's in effect.""  Compounding the issue, he noted, is that even after the shutdown ends, staffers have to catch up on anything they missed during the furlough.  ""There's talk about the [initial public offering] calendar being pushed back,"" he said.  Mining manufacturer Canaan is at least one crypto firm reportedly considering a U.S. IPO. While the company is said to be in the early stages of this decision, Molinari believes an extended shutdown could postpone IPO approvals ""indefinitely.""  The issues mirror those faced by the financial technology sector in the U.S. more broadly, as noted in an analysis piece published by Roll Call, a news site focused on the U.S. federal government.  Roll Call noted that the CFTC, which has requested information on ether and the ethereum network, is unable to review any comments already submitted. In its request for information, the CFTC noted that any submissions would ""advance [its] mission of ensuring the integrity of the derivatives markets,"" which may indicate the regulator is assessing a potential ether futures market.  Eyes on the Hill  As regulatory activity slows to a halt, a crypto industry group is focusing its efforts on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers in the House and Senate are still open for business.  ""We've been making real progress engaging with lawmakers and regulators on the merits of the token economy in the last several months, but the shutdown puts the handbrake on some of those conversations,"" Kristin Smith, director of external affairs for the Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk.  She added:  ""There are pressing concerns on a number of fronts – taxes, SEC guidance, Treasury guidance – and the shutdown, at the very least, pushes those issues to the back burner for the foreseeable future.""  The SEC could not be reached for comment. When contacted via email, a spokesman's auto-reply explained:  ""Due to a lapse in appropriations for the federal government, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is currently closed. I am currently out of the office, and will return to the office once an appropriation has been enacted. During the closure, I will not be monitoring or responding to my emails. Thank you.""

CEO Kelly Loeffler announced Monday that the New York Stock Exchange–backed startup was acquiring ""certain assets"" belonging to Rosenthal Collins Group (RCG), an independent futures commission merchant. RCG had previously announced it was selling its customer accounts and brokerage business to British firm Marex Spectron.  Bakkt previously announced it had raised nearly $183 million in a funding round, with the funds intended to building up the exchange's infrastructure.  The acquisition will help Bakkt improve its risk management and treasury operations, Loeffler wrote, adding that the deal will also help improve Bakkt's anti-money laundering/know-your-customer operations.  The transaction is expected to be finalized next month.  Referencing a regulatory delay in launching the company's anticipated futures exchange, Loeffler added:  ""This acquisition underlines the fact we’re not standing still as we await regulatory approval by the CFTC for the launch of regulated trading in our crypto markets. Our mission requires significant investment in technology to establish an innovative platform, as well as financial market expertise to deliver the most trusted fintech ecosystem for digital assets.""

However, the company is still waiting on approval through the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as it intends to custody bitcoin for clients in its own ""warehouse.""

42402440,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqms,1547483116,HSBC Says It's Settled $250 Billion in Trades With Distributed Ledger Tech,"HSBC, one of the largest banks in the world, announced Monday it had settled more than $250 billion in transactions using distributed ledger technology (DLT).  The bank said in a press release that it settled 3 million foreign exchange (FX) transactions and made a further 150,000 payments using its HSBC FX Everywhere platform. The company said it has been using this platform for the last year ""to orchestrate payments across HSBC's internal balance sheets.""  HSBC's platform has resulted in ""significant efficiencies and opportunities,"" the release added. The bank did not specify if FX Everywhere was developed completely in-house or built on an open-source protocol.  In particular, the bank said that using a DLT platform has allowed it to verify that payments are settled without needing external confirmation; to unify intra-company trade data on a ""shared, single version of the truth""; and to consolidate its view of cash flows.  In a statement, Richard Bibbey, HSBC's interim global head of FX and commodities, noted that the bank and its clients conduct ""thousands of foreign exchange transactions,"" which can range across different balance sheets and countries.  The DLT platform makes these internal flows more efficient, he said, adding:  ""Following successful implementation inside the bank, we are now exploring how this technology could help multinational clients – who also have multiple treasury centres and cross-border supply chains – better manage foreign exchange flows within their organisations.""  HSBC has hinted at its work with blockchain technology in the past. Last February, HSBC senior innovation manager Joshua Kroeker said during a media call that the company was on the verge of launching pilot programs to organize blockchain transactions.  At the time, he cited a specific project aimed at digitizing letters of credit.

42402432,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqf0,1547481649,Malaysia to Regulate ICOs as Securities Offerings from Tuesday,"Malaysia’s securities watchdog will have powers to regulate digital asset offerings and crypto exchanges as of Tuesday.  According to a notice from the country's Securities Commission (SC), the Capital Markets and Services (Prescription of Securities) (Digital Currency and Digital Token) Order 2019 will come into force on Jan. 15 following a statement from the finance minister this morning.  The prescription order means that token offerings and exchanges would require approval from the SC before starting operations and would have to comply with securities laws in the country.  “Any person offering an ICO or operating a digital asset exchange without SC’s approval may be punished, on conviction, with imprisonment not exceeding 10 years and fine not exceeding 10 million Malaysian ringgits [$2.44 million],” Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in his statement, according to a report from The Star Online.  The commission also said that it will work with the central bank to issue a full legal framework on digital assets by end of the Q1 2019.  The SC explains that ""The guidelines will among others, establish criteria for determining fit and properness of issuers and exchange operators, disclosure standards and best practices in price discovery, trading rules and client asset protection.""  Entities dealing in digital assets will be required to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML / CFT) rules, as well as ""cyber security and business continuity measures,"" the agency said.  However, Lim added that “In particular, we believe digital assets have a role to play as an alternative fundraising avenue for entrepreneurs and new businesses, and an alternate asset class for investors,” according to The Star.  Last month, the SC and Bank Negara Malaysia, the country’s central bank, jointly explained that the new regulations are aimed to bring digital assets ""within the remit of securities laws to promote fair and orderly trading and ensure investor protection.”  The statements leave some uncertainty over the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies as opposed to ICO tokens in the country.  “People have asked me if [cryptocurrency and digital currency] are legal or illegal. At the moment, the answer is neither legal nor illegal as the situation is still unclear,” Khalid Abdul Samad, the country’s territories minister, said in a New Straits Times report on Saturday.

42402438,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqlt,1547477953,LedgerX Launches 'Bitcoin Fear Index' to Track Price Volatility,"LedgerX thinks cryptocurrency traders should be able to assess bitcoin's volatility. And, taking a leaf out of the stock market's book, the derivatives trading platform has built an index to track this benchmark.  The company announced Monday that it was launching the LedgerX Volatility Index (LXVX), which will track the expected volatility for bitcoin. The firm will draw data for the index from its regulated bitcoin options, which various institutions have been trading over the past year.  Juthica Chou, LedgerX's president and chief risk officer, told CoinDesk that the LXVX is similar to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), a popular measure of the stock market's anticipated volatility.  ""[A volatility index] tells you the expected certainty that the market is forecasting ... That’s what it tells you with respect to any market,"" she explained.  Or, put another way, the LXVX can be described as ""a bitcoin fear index,"" much like the VIX is referred to as the stock market fear index, she said.  Chou, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs as a volatility trader, said that the VIX was an important benchmark, and its usefulness is why LedgerX decided to build one for bitcoin.  It can allow traders and investors to monitor risk as they manage their businesses, she said.  As an example, she cited bitcoin's volatility near the end of 2018 compared to the beginning of this year, saying:  ""If you look basically since the start of the year, the LXVX is down about 20 percent so it’s down to about 68, and … this is still approximately three times the volatility of the stock market but it’s very telling in the bitcoin space because it shows that there is less of the fear and uncertainty than what existed [in] December.""  At present, the index is not a tradeable product, though building such a product is a goal further down the line. LedgerX's institutional clients have already been able to track the benchmark for at least a few months, and it is now publicly available through LedgerX's website.  Thriving in winter  Separately, LedgerX announced it had cleared over $500 million in bitcoin derivatives since its inception in October 2017, across more than 50,000 contracts over ""a wide range of strikes,"" Chou said, referring to the price at which an option may be exercised.  While other startups in the crypto space have suffered from the prolonged crypto bear market, it has actually been more beneficial for LedgerX, as it leads to greater trading activity.  ""We saw, for example, a lot of put options trading in December and the end of November while the broader market was selling off,"" she said. ""Now that we're bouncing back, we're seeing a lot more call options.""

42402429,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqe1,1547473445,Arrington XRP Leads $1 Million Funding Round in Dapp Economy Startup,"Dapp economy startup Totle has raised $1 million in a private funding round.  Arrington XRP, the hedge fund launched by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, led the round along with NEO Global Capital and Goren Holm Ventures.  Detroit-based Totle offers an application programming interface (API) allowing crypto wallets such as EtherDelta and RadarRelay to offer certain exchange functions, including payments and transactions, arbitrage exploitation and rebalancing, said CEO David Bleznak. In particular, the startup focuses on supporting other decentralized platforms.  The new funding will be largely be used to hire more developers, with about 40 percent also going into administration and marketing, Bleznak told CoinDesk.  ""By adding just two or three more developers we can integrate a lot more [business-to-business] customers,"" he said.  Response to the API, which launched in the last month, has generally been positive, he said, adding: ""A dozen groups are actively integrating [the API] into their softwares and another 50 groups that don’t have the resources [are in line].""  The company's tool allows for retail investors to optimize price discovery when buying or selling across borders, said Geoffrey Arone, a partner with Arrington XRP.  ""If you're a [professional] trader, you can talk to people and get the best possible price,"" he said, but ""a lot of folks don’t have the time or means to execute [trades] to get the best possible price.""  He also cited the team's flexibility as a reason for Arrington XRP's investment, noting that Totle had been working on a decentralized application with a business-to-consumer focus, but shifted to focus on the business-to-business API base due to ""natural consumer demands.""  The investment indicates Arrington XRP's confidence in how Totle is operating as well, he said, following previous statements by Arrington indicating the company may not invest in other U.S.-based startups.

The new service, which will allow approved clients to ""quickly and conveniently trade assets,"" will support nearly 200 cryptocurrencies already offered by the exchange, the company announced Monday. According to the exchange, the OTC desk will provide ""guaranteed pricing"" for major trades, ""typically $250,000 or greater.""  OTC trading desks facilitate direct transactions between two parties, unlike exchange trading where buy and sell orders are matched through an order-book.  The desk itself will not go live until 18:00 UTC on Monday, Bittrex said. In a statement, CEO Bill Shihara called the new offering a ""game-changing trading option,"" highlighting the number of tokens Bittrex intends to offer on the new platform.  He added:  ""With one of the most extensive selections of digital assets of any OTC desk available, this offering will be another way for Bittrex to further advance adoption of blockchain technology worldwide, while also providing our customers with price certainty and a fast and easy way to trade large blocks of digital assets.""  Bittrex joins other U.S.-based exchanges in launching OTC trading desks, including Coinbase and Poloniex.  Coinbase's OTC service will be available for its institutional clients, though the service is currently restricted to its Coinbase Prime customers, meaning financial institutions trading with other business funds.  Similarly, Poloniex began offering institutional accounts last quarter, on top of its parent company Circle's existing Circle Trade product. Circle Trade offers institutional clients a limited number of trading pairs last month for institutional clients. Any customers looking to participate must also issue a minimum order size of $250,000.  Editor's note: This article has been updated.

The state government announced Friday that the Office of the Vermont Secretary of State and the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation have signed a memorandum of understanding to conduct the pilot that will examine the tech's potential in digital recordkeeping and registration and regulatory processes.  The trial program will give captive insurers – licensed insurance companies formed by one or more parent entities to provide self coverage – in the state an option to file registration and reporting documents using private blockchain technology. The state government currently maintains paper and digital copies of filed documents.  Vermont aims to create a “transparent and validated” record of transactions through blockchain, as well as reduce costs compared to traditional record-keeping methods.  Jim Condos, Vermont Secretary of State, said in a statement:  ""This pilot will allow us to examine whether or not the application of blockchain technology for digital recordkeeping can improve aspects of the state regulatory process.""  The government has already started the process of identifying vendors with technical and consulting expertise for the pilot program, through a Request for Information (RFI) process.  Vermont is one of the leading markets for captive insurance in the U.S., with the state government registering 20-40 new companies in the sector per year, according to the RFI.  The state has launched several blockchain initiatives in the past, including the signing ofa bill last May that opened the door for the creation of blockchain-based limited liability companies. And, in January 2018, the city government of South Burlington partnered with blockchain startup Propy to trial a land registration system using the technology.

42402443,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqpp,1547463622,Bitcoin Risks Return to December Lows After Price Drop to $3.5K,"After breaching key support on Sunday, emboldened bears could soon push bitcoin (BTC) prices back towards $3,100.  Following a drop to a 3.5-week low of $3,476 at 16:00 UTC yesterday, the cryptocurrency closed at $3,516, effectively invalidating the bullish view put forward by the higher low of $3,566 carved out on Dec. 27.  That move also added credence to the bearish reversal signaled by the 9 percent price drop witnessed last Thursday.  Put simply, the bears have strengthened their control of the market, after the bulls failed to penetrate the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $4,130 and build a stronger rally last week.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,530 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart        As seen above, BTC found acceptance below $3,566 (Dec. 27 low) yesterday, validating the bearish doji reversal confirmed on Jan. 10.  The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting bearish conditions at 42.00, having breached the ascending trendline last week. Further, the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending south, indicating bearish setup.  So, it could be argued that the recovery rally from the December low of $3,122 has only ended up recharging the engines for a fresh sell-off.  3-day chart  BTC's fall back to $3,500 has invalidated the positive view put forward by the three-day bullish outside-reversal candle of Dec. 20.  Moreover, the cryptocurrency's failure to produce a significant price rally despite the positive divergence of the RSI, confirmed on Dec. 14, indicates that the bearish sentiment is still quite strong.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, BTC has created a bearish outside-reversal candle (last week’s price action engulfed the previous week’s high and low) signaling a resumption of the primary bearish trend, as represented by the downward sloping 10-week moving average (MA).  View  BTC could re-test the 200-week MA of $3,266 in the next few days and could extend the decline to the December low of $3,122.  A weekly close (Sunday as per UTC) below the 200-week MA of $3,266 would open the doors for a deeper drop below $3,000.  Acceptance above the downward sloping 10-week MA, currently at $3,919, would abort the bearish view.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42402441,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqnr,1547460002,The Ethereum Classic Attacker Has Sent a Bigger Message,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ___________    One of the more disturbing side effects of the crypto market’s downturn is it has made it easier for malicious actors to launch 51-percent attacks, making that most fundamental of blockchain security breach more frequent.  But, like all unfortunate events in the never-ending drama of crypto, the real-world losses, in this case, are providing a valuable lesson. In this case, it’s a lesson about the role that network effects play in building security, especially for blockchains that have adopted bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus model.  Crypto enthusiasts debate ad nausea about the principles of this or that chain’s design, and those debates are important. But if a permissionless blockchain doesn’t have a large enough community of users, developers and miners operating in a self-reinforcing manner of value creation and protection, they’re vulnerable.  That was the takeaway this week when crypto exchange Coinbase announced it had detected a series of deep chain reorganizations within ethereum classic (ETC). Someone had accumulated a majority of the ETC network’s hashing power and had used that dominant position to alter past transactions, resulting in double spends of 219,500 ETC, which Coinbase estimated to be worth $1.1 million at the time.  This was arguably the most significant 51-percent attack ever, more so than those seen on bitcoin gold and vertcoin.  Twist of fate  It was also, however, an especially painful blow for ethereum classic’s true believers.  They belong to a minority community of ethereum users, developers and miners who in 2016 decided to keep working on the old blockchain that was left when leading developers in the ethereum community convinced a majority of users to run a new software that would reverse the transactions of the notorious DAO hacker.  The ETC community’s position was often described as a principled stance: regardless of what losses were incurred by investors in The DAO investment project. Whether you called it theft or not, the ethereum blockchain should be immutable, they would say. No cabal of leaders should be able to organize a software change that invalidates transactions that the network had previously accepted.  Yet, those principles proved of little value when an attacker overwhelmed their network.  Ethereum, on the other hand, which represents the forked version of the blockchain that the majority moved to after The DAO, has, for now at least, remained free from a 51-percent attack.  This is not to say that ethereum is immune from such risks in the future. With its price at 90 percent of its year-ago peak and still volatile, the profitability of mining pools has fallen significantly, which essentially makes it cheaper to rent enough hashing power to launch a 51-percent double-spend attack.  Still, the numbers point to a much more secure foundation at ethereum than ethereum classic. According to Crypto51, which tracks the estimated cost of launching such an attack on different proof-of-work blockchains, it would cost $88,633 to launch a one-hour attack on ethereum, as opposed to just $4,571 for ethereum classic.  Ethereum is second only to bitcoin’s $281,060 on that list as the most expensive to hit with a 51-percent attack.  Positive feedback loops  Price and existing network hashing power are key drivers of this cost, but what’s equally important over time is that the broader idea of a large network of users that creates a positive feedback loop that encourages developers to work on a blockchain’s code.  A coin’s security is helped by ongoing development, not only because of the improvements and tweaks that are made to the code, but also because there are more eyes watching the network.  For all these interrelated reasons, ethereum’s comparatively large global community of enthusiastic users make it a more secure blockchain than ethereum classic. A history of immutability, if that’s what ethereum classic truly represented, was of lesser importance from a security perspective than the strength of the competing ethereum chain’s community.  This is borne out in CoinDesk’s Crypto-Economics Explorer, whose five metrics of value – price, exchange transactions, social activity, developer interest and network size – all show markedly higher levels for ethereum than ethereum classic. The data captures a much healthier network effect, a positive feedback loop of interest, activity and value that gives the former comparatively more security against such attacks.  The lessons here are important. And they are not that dissimilar from the lessons learned in the battles between Bitcoin Core and the now many forks that have occurred after bitcoin cash was first created a year ago.  For all the noise that the bitcoin cash, bitcoin SV and bitcoin ABC crowds make, they have nothing like the vast pool of community value that Bitcoin Core has accumulated.  On the blockchain, community equals security.  Weights image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,ETC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | EXCHANGE | MINING,Michael J.

In a statement shared with CoinDesk, a Bitmain spokesperson said that, while the company has not yet shut down its Amsterdam operation, the decision has already been made and the process is underway.  ""As we build a long-term, sustainable and scalable business, we are making adjustments to our staff and operations. This includes the decision to close our Amsterdam and Israel offices,"" the spokesperson added.  Bitmain has not yet specified the timeline of the closure, or how many staff will be impacted as a result. However, according to information on LinkedIn, at least nine people are identified as Bitmain employees in the Dutch capital, and their responsibilities mostly focus on the operations and development of Bitmain's flagship mining pool BTC.com.  ""We are really focusing on things that are core to our mission and not things that are auxiliary. We will continue to hire the best talent from a diverse range of backgrounds,"" the firm added.  In early December, Bitmain confirmed the closure of its Israeli office, with the layoff of over 20 staff who were mainly in charge of development of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. The firm cited the steep decline of the overall cryptocurrency market in 2018 as the reason for the move.  And, on Thursday last week, Texas Public Radio reported that Bitmain had halted its mining operations in Rockdale in the state's Milam County, just months after it announced the new site that was said to be bringing 400 jobs via a $500 million investment.  Bitmain confirmed the workforce reduction at Rockdale’s mining farm site in a statement, saying “no location/teams are excluded from” the company-wide cut backs. However, it emphasized that it’s not abandoning the Rockdale site.  Milam County judge Steve Young said that all of Bitmain's staff at the mining site, bar two engineers and a human resource director, had been laid off, while ""all operations had been suspended.""  ""I'm really disappointed because we had advertised this. We had waited for this. We had wanted this. We had welcomed this,” Young was quoted as saying.  The news comes at a time when the Chinese mining firm has been whittling down its team at its home offices as well, including staff focusing on its miner equipment, artificial intelligence and mining pool businesses, after a rapid expansion in 2018. A plan to replace its current co-CEOs, Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan, is also reportedly underway.

42402428,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqc3,1547442020,This $100K Luxury Swiss Watch Will Have a Built-In Crypto Wallet,"A. Favre & Fils, a luxury Swiss watchmaker that traces its family history back three centuries, is developing a handcrafted mechanical timepiece with a built-in crypto-wallet.  The company announced last week that the watch will have crypto “cold wallet” and “state of the art proprietary security solution” based on blockchain technology.  A. Favre & Fils CEO Laurent Favre said in a statement:  “We have developed this first timepiece with the idea of offering something useful for the crypto-community, not simply something to spend their money on.”  A company representative told CoinDesk that the watch will cost in the range of CHF100,000 – CHF150,000 (or $102,000 – $153,000), depending upon the model and its features and materials.  The watch will “guarantee ultimate in-data security and privacy protection”, the company said, adding that the first prototype will be released during the second quarter of 2019.  “You have to keep adding relevant features that advance the design. It’s a bit like figuring out the future of steam engines in the age of electric trains,” Favre was quoted as saying to SWI swissinfo.ch, a news outlet owned by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation.
