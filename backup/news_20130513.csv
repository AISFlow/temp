42424864,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrXh,1368476602,"Despite bubble talk, bitcoin prices seen rising","Are we in the midst of a bitcoin bubble? Perhaps, but that doesn't necessarily mean prices are on the verge of collapse. And, bubble or no bubble, some analysts believe bitcoin still has room to grow.  Former Wall Street analyst Henry Blodget says past price bubbles show that, in general, prices can rise much higher and bubbles can last much longer than most observers think.  ""Internet stocks, for example, were first described as a bubble in 1995, a full five years before the peak,"" Blodget writes on Business Insider. ""And the amount of money made in those next five years made everyone who was skeptical early on look and feel like a fool. House prices, meanwhile, were described as a bubble as early as 2002 and 2003. And it wasn't until 2007, many years later, that house prices finally peaked.""  Bitcoin prices have been volatile this year, soaring above $250 in April before dropping down to the $50 range. Today's price is about $117.  So what caused the recent volatility? Blogger Jonathan Stacke speculates that media coverage criticizing bitcoin for its volatility has actually contributed to more volatility.  ""As news coverage drove unfamiliar speculators into the market, the price continued to rise and interest continued to grow,"" Stacke noted in a recent article posted on The Genesis Block. ""That is, of course, until fear of loss from a product most still don't understand drove people out of the currency en masse when prices began to slide, exacerbating the pullbacks. As press coverage waned and the short-term speculators left, volatility began to subside.""  ""Arguably the best thing that's happened to bitcoin in the past month is that people stopped talking about bitcoin,"" he added.  And there's always the possibility that the recent price actions surrounding bitcoin might not actually be a bubble, Blodget noted, pointing out that higher prices down the road could be a result of a healthy, developing bitcoin market.  ""If bitcoins become an accepted currency everywhere in the world, if governments don't intervene and make bitcoin transactions illegal, and if the supply of bitcoins remains finite (if the systems aren't hacked or the anonymous creators don't get greedy and decide to create many more), then bitcoin prices could go much, much higher,"" Blodget wrote.  Blogger Farhad Manjoo -- who recently wrote about his bitcoin buying and selling adventures on Slate.com -- believes that, once the sites that manage bitcoin become easier to use, more people will buy the currency and ""bitcoin will take off.""  ""There are some genuine uses for it as a currency -- there are plenty of people who want to transfer money anonymously, over long distances, for free,"" Manjoo wrote. ""Bitcoin is the best way to do that right now. And because there are a limited number of bitcoins, as demand increases their value relative to the dollar will increase as well -- settling in at somewhere over $200, I'd guess.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/13/despite-bubble-talk-bitcoin-prices-seen-rising,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54d86dcb249f057c184ad6b43b11d7cf0fa81a9a-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424867,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrbh,1368466468,Bitcoin network out-muscles top 500 supercomputers,"Is the bitcoin network the most powerful distributed computing system -- hence, the most powerful computer, period -- on Earth?  Maybe, although the designation comes marked with a few asterisks.  According to Bitcoin Charts, which tracks activity on the distributed global network of bitcoin mining computers, the network has achieved a hashrate (the rate at which new blocks of bitcoins are mined) of 1039.79 petaflops, or more than 1 exaflops. As The Genesis Block points out, that's more than eight times the performance level of the world's 500 most powerful supercomputers.  (A few notes on terminology here: flops is a measure of how many ""floating-point operations per second"" a computer can achieve. A petaflop is 1015 (one quadrillion) flops, while an exaflop is 1018 (one quintillion) flops, or 1,000 petaflops.)  While a commenter on The Genesis Block post notes the bitcoin network is only six times -- rather than eight times -- faster than the top 500 supercomputers, the achievement is nothing to sneeze at. Still, there are a couple of caveats to the record:  One, as The Genesis Block points out, bitcoin mining relies on integer calculations rather than flops. So we're not really comparing apples to apples.  Two, the estimates used to convert hashes to flops (resulting in about 12,700 flops per hash) date to 2011, before ASIC devices became the norm for bitcoin mining. ASICs don't handle flops at all, so the current comparison is very rough.  Applying the 12,700 flops per hash rate to the leading supercomputers shows the top 10, with a combined speed of 48 petaflops, have just 5 percent the muscle of today's bitcoin network, according to The Genesis Block. Even adding in the remaining 490 most powerful supercomputers achieves just a fraction of what the bitcoin network can do.  ""But let's be honest,"" The Genesis Block concludes, ""these computers have better things to work on like curing cancer, solving global warming and monitoring banking transactions.""  As Quartz puts it, ""what bitcoin has wrought is the world's fastest supercomputer"" ... but one that's good only for mining bitcoins, and nothing else.  ""What a waste,"" Gizmodo opines. ""(C)an you imagine what we could do if this energy was put behind other tough problems? We'll you're going to have to imagine, because so long as mining bitcoins can earn you money and folding proteins can't, it's pretty clear which one is gonna get done.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/13/bitcoin-network-out-muscles-top-500-supercomputers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55bcb1864116979a068039c3916fc2d90ac18c19-628x356.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424871,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrhh,1368458736,Small-biz law firm sees opportunity in bitcoin,"As the growing bitcoin economy attracts increasing attention from regulators, it's probably fitting that one of the latest businesses to begin accepting the digital currency is a law firm.  Law 4 Small Business  , or L4SB -- whose slogan is, ""A little law now can save a lot later"" -- is an ""internet-savvy, high-tech law firm and law practice,"" said attorney Laurence S. Donahue, who founded the Albuquerque, New Mexico-based firm. Because of that, he said, ""accepting and honoring bitcoin adds credibility to that claim.""  Bitcoin,"" Donahue said, is ""not for the faint of heart, as its value fluctuates greatly and there is quite a bit of disinformation on its susceptibility to hacker attacks and manipulation."" However, his firm believes the currency ""represents the future of commerce.""  Until the bitcoin economy matures, though, L4SB foresees ""upswings, downswings, and rapid changes in commerce and financial laws, as our centralized systems adjust.""

42424877,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrph,1368457857,"Here come the geeks, and this time they're rich","Bitcoin is due to change the face of finance, but could have interesting social effects too, according to a leading security researcher.  Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, believes Bitcoin could have a major impact beyond online payments.  He said: ""I first heard about Bitcoin in 2009 and thought it was very interesting and invented by a genius. I first thought it was a huge waste of computing power but them realised that the system was doing something useful - tracking transactions. I'm not sure that Bitcoin will be the breakthrough digital currency, but it will be something which looks very like it.""  Hypponen said that only the 'geekiest of the geeks' were involved in early bitcoin mining, assembling their own machines and rigs. He said: ""We've seen what bankers do when they get rich but the recent success and speculation around Bitcoin guarantees that the geekiest geeks on the planet will get rich - what will they do with their money? It will be interesting to see what these super-geeks decide to invest in."" Bitcoin mining in 2009 was very much a niche interest - Satoshi Nakamoto's paper outlining the Bitcoin protocol was only published in 2008.  But he warned there were two main security risks for Bitcoin users or anyone mining similar currencies like Litecoin. ""We've already seen malware attacks on Bitcoin - either direct attacks on exchanges or by searching for wallets on people's compromised computers. If they take your wallet your Bitcoins are gone - just like cash. The thieves might struggle to use the coins but you'll have lost them.""  These problems are likely to get more common as the technology increasingly enters the mainstream, and begins to be installed by less informed users.  The second security fear is cyber crooks creating botnets for mining Bitcoins or other currencies. The world's second largest botnet - ZeroAccess - has over one million PCs which have spent the last year and a half mining Bitcoins. Hypponen said: ""The Russian guys behind this must have made millions - and they'll be investing this back into malware. These botnets used to be for sending spam, but now they're making serious money.""  Right now mining Bitcoin mining is moving to specialised machines but rivals like Litecoin still use ordinary PCs to mine their currency.  In future we could see criminals targetting other devices - because with mining you don't need a user. Embedded devices could be infected for mining purposes. Servers, mainframes or even set-top boxes could all be targetted in this way. If mining continues to provide a financial return for criminals so it is worth their while to invest in spreading malware infections.  ""Bitcoin mining botnets are not a problem for embedded devices yet, but they could be for bitcoin clones - this provides a reason to hack your toaster.""  Hypponen said: ""Our enemies have money to invest, they're hiring developers and software testers. They're even setting themselves up as operators and ISPs, making our job even harder.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,John Oates,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/13/here-come-the-geeks-and-this-time-theyre-rich,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2fa251f781e01d9420106914b245604955aaafce-1690x1187.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

To further tempt Kindle punters Amazon is offering ten per cent discounts on future coin purchases.  Although US only for now we would expect the system to be offered elsewhere in the world soon.  The Coins, for now at least, appear more like a loyalty card system than a fully-fledged currency. We assume Amazon hopes to boost the number of apps developed for its hardware as well as increase customer loyalty. We covered the original announcement two weeks ago.

42424881,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrvh,1368433524,Developers redo Satoshi software,"A team of software developers is releasing a new bitcoin client, designed as an alternative to the original software that implemented the Bitcoin protocol. The new software, called btcd, solves several issues that they say made it difficult to port the software to new operating systems, and will be showcased at the Bitcoin 2013 conference later this week.  Bitcoind was the original Bitcoin client implementing the bitcoin protocol, and was partly developed by Satoshi, the mysterious inventor of the Bitcoin algorithm. It was developed as a ‘daemon’ – a program designed to be started and manipulated via instructions typed into a command line. The software, which was portable across Windows, Mac, and Linux systems, was particularly useful for administering remotely. It is useful for integrating into other bitcoin client software, or into payment systems.  However, the Conformal team identified areas for improvement in bitcoind after trying to port it to its own operating system, which was based on an open source system called OpenBSD. There were several programming functions that were not portable from one system to another, and the firm also had problems with testing the source code.  “After seeing these issues with the porting, I felt that the bitcoin ecosystem could use an alternative to bitcoind,” said Jake Yocom-Piatt, CEO at Conformal.  Bitcoind was developed in C++, but the development team used Go, a programming language developed by Google, which was designed to support large numbers of concurrent operations.  The company has released source code for the first part of its system, called btcwire, on the collaborative programming site GitHub. It handles the delivery of messages to the bitcoin network.  “Our goal is to continue releasing packages from btcd as we increase test coverage and bring them up to a professional level,” said Conformal developer David Collins, who will be talking at the bitcoin 2013 conference on Saturday May 18.  The team has vowed to add more functionality to its software, including handling wallets, and connecting to Tor, which is a network for anonymous online communication.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/13/developers-redo-satoshi-software,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23949925911829a3238d9ae7272df52073b10654-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
