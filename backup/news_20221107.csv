42415074,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWRVT,1667865150,Bitcoin Mining Major Riot Blockchain Misses Analyst Estimates for Q3 Earnings,"CORRECTION (Nov. 8, 01:02 UTC): A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Riot's consensus analyst estimate was for adjusted net earnings of $1 per share, instead of 1 cent.  Bitcoin mining heavyweight Riot Blockchain (RIOT) disappointed average analysts' expectations in its third quarter.  The miner generated $46.3 million in revenue, lower than the average estimate of $56.3 million, bringing net loss to 24 cents, compared to a consensus estimate of adjusted net earnings per share of 1 cent according to FactSet.  Riot's revenue were lower than the previous quarter's $72.9 million, and lower than for the same period last year, when the firm reported $64.8 million. The miner attributed the decrease to the declining price of bitcoin and to its curtailing of activities in response to surging energy demand in Texas, according to a press release on Monday.  RIOT's share price was down about 1% in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq, following the release of its earnings report.  The miners cash reserves, however, didn't move much compared to the previous quarter, even as other major miners are saying that they are close to bankruptcy. Riot had $255 million of cash on hand and 6,766 BTC at the end of the third quarter, compared to $270.5 million in cash and 6,653 BTC at the end of the second quarte.  Riot is one of many miners participating in curtailment processes in Texas, under which they power off their machines when demand surges across the electrical grid in exchange for credits they can use later with the local grid operator. Riot earned $13.1 million in such credits throughout the quarter, $9.5 million of which came in July. Its bitcoin production for that month was down 28% as it participated in this so-called demand response program.  The miners' hosting revenue, meaning fees it collects for providing infrastructure to other companies' machines, also decreased quarter-on-quarter from $8.4 million to $9.8 million.  Riot's mining margins have dropped significantly, similar to other miners. In the second quarter of this year, mining revenue in excess of cost of revenue for the segment was $28.2 million, or 61% of revenue from mining. In the third quarter, it was $7.4 million, about 33% of total mining revenue.

Technical Take  FTX/Alameda Questions Hold the Spotlight as US Midterm Election, Inflation Data Loom  By Glenn Williams Jr  FTT’s $22 price is significant when considering the asset’s trading volume. The Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool determines an asset’s potential areas of support and resistance. It provides a visual representation of trading volume by price level, and indicates areas of high or low agreement on price.  An asset’s price tends to move slowly in “high volume node” areas, as there is generally sufficient market demand at those particular price levels. Prices often move rapidly through “low volume node” areas and can lead to rapid increases or decreases dependent on market direction.  What this implies for FTX is that if its price cannot be defended at the $22 level, buying demand doesn’t appear again until close to $10.

It is actually a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fork, which means its fundamentals are very similar to those of Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin has a limited supply, and mining rewards halved roughly every 4 years.The key difference between these two cryptocurrencies is that Litecoin was created to transact faster and more cheaply. This is achieved through faster block production, Segregated Witness, (SegWit), and also by enabling Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which Bitcoin also uses.Litecoin has been described by many as the digital silver to Bitcoin&apos;s digital gold. It is also a good and cheap environment to test out applications for Bitcoin.Litecoin has rallied strongly in anticipation of its halving event and higher adoption, but ultimately, digital silver has no real purpose like there was for physical silver.The Litecoin CycleMost people are familiar with the Bitcoin cycle surrounding the halving events. In the past, bitcoin has tended to rally following the halving event and then entered a bear market in the 2 years prior to the next halving.Litecoin also has halving events every four years, and we can also see that price tends to react in a certain way in relation to these.LTC cycle (TradingView)The black l...",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,BTC | FIAT | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4554413-litecoin-rally-in-the-making?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3931231.jpeg

42420889,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZPx,1667856941,"FTX/Alameda Questions Hold the Spotlight as US Midterm Election, Inflation Data Loom","Crypto investors will be noting two significant macro events this week: the Nov. 8 midterm elections and the Nov. 10 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.  How crypto prices will react to the midterms is unclear. Democrats and Republicans are more focused on gaining control of the House of Representatives and Senate than debating crypto policies.  Investors will be eyeing whether the CPI veers much from an expected 6.5% increase that will signal inflation remains untamed, potentially testing anew cryptos’ status as an inflation hedge.  FTX questions  Meanwhile, the crypto industry breathlessly considered questions about the solvency of crypto exchange FTX and the impact on its sister company, Alameda Research. As CoinDesk reported over the weekend, much of Alameda’s equity appears to consist of FTX’s FTT token. The outsized percentage of FTX’s value tied to an asset issued by a related entity has raised concerns about a repeat of issues that have already sent three of the industry’s biggest brands this year – crypto lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital – into bankruptcy.  FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted unequivocally that FTX and its assets “are fine.”  ""FTX has enough to cover all client holdings,"" he wrote. ""We don't invest client assets (even in Treasurys). We have been processing all withdrawals, and will continue to be.""  When Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced earlier that his crypto exchange would liquidate all remaining FTT on its books, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison responded that her company would “happily buy back” FTT at $22 from them.  At the time, FTT was trading in a $21 to $24 range. An offer to bid at $22 aligned with market conditions.  Still, FTT’s $22 price is significant when considering the asset’s trading volume. The Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool determines an asset’s potential areas of support and resistance. It provides a visual representation of trading volume by price level, and indicates areas of high or low agreement on price.  An asset’s price tends to move slowly in “high volume node” areas, as there is generally sufficient market demand at those particular price levels.  Prices often move rapidly through “low volume node” areas and can lead to rapid increases or decreases dependent on market direction.  What this implies for FTX is that if its price cannot be defended at the $22 level, buying demand doesn’t appear again until close to $10.  It can be argued that another significant decrease in activity exists below $10, until approximately $5.  FTT’s recent price decline dovetailed with a significant spike in volume, which is generally a bearish sign.  Whether the FTX and Alameda rumors have substance remains unclear. FTT’s price was recently 0.26% higher, actually outpacing BTC.  The most important question is whether a decline in FTT, and potential insolvency of FTX and Alameda would have a negative spillover impact on the prices of BTC and ETH.  This would likely only take place if FTX and/or Alameda had to liquidate BTC and ETH holdings to shore up its liquidity.  Little in bitcoin or ether’s current price action indicates as such.",NEUTRAL,BTC | FTT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FTT,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/07/ftxalameda-questions-hold-the-spotlight-as-us-midterm-election-inflation-data-loom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1a78a31caa9d16e584b42d33279c6a574765a69-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415076,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWRg5,1667852479,"Solana Falls and Speculation Centers on Links to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, Alameda","Solana’s SOL token was one of the biggest losers in digital-asset markets on Monday, and crypto analysts speculated there might be a connection to the recent drama surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange and his trading firm, Alameda Research.  One theory is that Alameda might try to dump its SOL tokens in a bid to raise fresh liquidity.  “The large amounts of SOL and Solana ecosystem tokens held by Alameda could get sold off in a worst-case scenario and underline the close links between FTX/Alameda and Solana,” said Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  The SOL token plunged 4.7% in the past 24 hours.  This week’s kerfuffle in crypto markets has evolved into a full-blown face-off between two of the industry’s biggest titans. It began when Changpeng Zhao, CEO of the rival exchange Binance, tweeted that his firm would sell its holdings of FTX’s exchange token, FTT – a stake reportedly worth more than $500 million. The token happens to be one of the biggest holdings on Alameda’s balance sheet, raising thorny questions about the blurry divisions between Bankman-Fried’s trading firm and the FTX exchange.  The FTT price rebounded after Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison tweeted that the company would happily buy Binance's FTT tokens for $22 each.  So a key question is how Alameda might pay for the FTT tokens if the trading firm were to step up as a buyer of the Binance stake.  SOL is Alameda's second-largest holding, and it also holds significant amounts of SOL ecosystem tokens like MAPS and OXY, according to Carey.  CoinDesk previously reported that a copy of Alameda's balance sheet shows the firm held $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.”  Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at research firm FundStrat, wrote Monday in a note that he expects Binance and Alameda to eventually reach an over-the-counter deal to “move all of Binance's FTT without adversely affecting the prevailing market price.”  Other SOL market theories  It could be that the SOL token is falling because of market pressures entirely unrelated to the FTX-Binance tete-a-tete.  The token spiked as much as 15% on Saturday after Google Cloud tagged the blockchain’s co-founder in a tweet that suggested an important disclosure was underway, before making the formal partnership announcement.  Then, on Sunday, the SOL price tumbled, in what may have been a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news,” according to Carey.  There’s also the simple possibility that the token was losing steam after the Solana blockchain’s big Breakpoint conference taking place in Lisbon, Portugal; the event concludes Monday.

Now the former Denver Broncos quarterback is trying to throw a touchdown pass to college athletes with NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on a platform he founded called CAMPUS.io.  Tebow, who also played for the New York Jets before spending several years in the baseball minor leagues in the New York Mets organization, started CAMPUS as a Solana-backed software company that aims to serve as a marketplace for college sports. The platform has teamed up with Nissan Heisman House for a contest that would give eight winners memorabilia and a virtual meet-and-greet with Tebow and seven other Heisman winners.  CAMPUS also gives college athletes a way to capitalize on their name, image and likeness.

The platform isn't meant just for football players, but also for other athletes such as gymnasts, Tebow explained. “It’s an opportunity for these young athletes to be able to take their brand awareness and use it,” he said.

Any collection created using the tool will be blacklisted from being resold on marketplaces that don’t enforce royalties like X2Y2 and Blur, which have considerably trimmed OpenSea’s market share to 50%, down from as high as 95%.  Read more: Retract Royalties, Reduce Revenue: NFT Creators Are Suffering and so Are Marketplaces  “Make no mistake, technical decisions like this involve trade-offs: enforcing creator fees on-chain requires sacrificing some of the censorship-resistance and permissionless nature of NFTs,” the company said in the blog post.  OpenSea is also working on royalty enforcement tools for existing collections, according to the blog post, though it won’t make any changes to the code of existing collections until at least Dec. 8.  The announcement was received well by the NFT-sphere as a creator-friendly alternative to ditching royalties altogether, unlike Magic Eden’s move to a royalty-optional model in October.  The NFT industry has seen more losers of the royalty debate than winners since the trend to move away from royalties began in August. Solana-based NFT project Y00ts created some controversy this past weekend by quietly re-adding a 3.33% creator fee to its collection on Magic Eden after being the first major project to set all royalties to 0% just a few weeks prior.

42394121,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXms1,1667846495,Money Crypto Versus Tech Crypto,"Our internal and external debates regarding regulation would improve if we thought of crypto as two ecosystems rather than one. There is a basic dichotomy that has a big effect on the policy debate, explains where we are with regulation today and will define how we move forward. But we never talk about it. That should change.  One side of crypto is predominantly about investment. Call it “money crypto.” In essence, it is about buying, holding, lending and trading tokens as investable assets. Money crypto wants big institutions and retirement funds to invest and a spot exchange-traded product that every retail investor buys. When money crypto says “it’s still early,” this means that most people haven’t bought yet. This side has the attention of regulators.  Bill Hughes is the senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters at ConsenSys Software.  The other side is about building peer-to-peer computer networks where participants transact by interacting with globally accessible software. Call it “tech crypto.” Tech crypto wants these new computer ecosystems to actually work and provide utility for their users. When tech crypto says “it’s still early,” it means that a lot of the key tech that will define the long term has yet to be built out. The required innovation has not much directly to do with prices going up (but prices going up isn’t irrelevant, in part because it impacts upon the security of these protocols). Generally, this side is poorly understood by regulators but some are learning fast.  Centralized finance (CeFi) is the beating heart of money crypto. Intermediaries define the investment landscape and are the driving force. In tech crypto, by contrast, the defining feature is software serving as a transactional counterparty or intermediary. Tech crypto is much more DeFi (decentralized finance) than CeFi.  Money crypto and tech crypto present different risks that public policy might address. In money crypto, the risks look more or less as they do in traditional finance: third-party custody, third-party-facilitated payments, retail investor protection, illicit finance and market manipulation, among other things. CeFi looks a lot like traditional finance (TradFi), after all. Tech crypto risk encompasses some of these categories but includes entirely different ones, too: hazardous self-custody, vulnerable smart contracts, good and bad actors having equal access and public, pseudonymous and irreversible transactions. DeFi opens up a whole different problem set with which public policy is unfamiliar.  See also: Why Trading Is Essential for Crypto | Opinion  The money crypto versus tech crypto distinction has come into brighter relief recently. Crypto OG Erik Voorhees and FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s recent discussion about regulatory policy touched often on this underlying distinction. SBF generally provided the perspective of money crypto while Voorhees often advanced the banner of tech crypto. Vitalik Buterin chimed in on Twitter that he would prefer slower investment mass adoption if it gave time for the tech to improve – a tech crypto perspective. The remarkably entertaining Bloomberg contributor Matt Levine astutely recognized a money versus tech distinction in his recent comprehensive treatment of crypto.  This distinction is in our face. It’s time we acknowledge it during regulatory debate. Failure to do just that has been muddling things for some time.  Money crypto has been the 800-pound gorilla in the regulatory debate so far. Money crypto captures far more popular attention, has a set of policy issues that need more immediate resolution (e.g., let Americans trade perpetual futures on margin), donates more to political campaigns, spends more on policy people, lobbyists and policy advertising, and generally is more sophisticated with how international, federal and state policy is created and implemented. Money crypto has thus been leading the agenda and defining the issues. “Regulatory clarity” has been the major policy talking point in large part because regulations are likely to open broader investor markets, not because developers want permission to write a new smart contract. Money crypto appears much more ready, willing and able to reach regulatory compromises that unlock new markets for their camp, even compromises that would present uncapped regulatory risk to tech crypto.  Money crypto has been driving the regulatory discussion, which has led many regulators to overemphasize the investment aspect of crypto. Digital assets are just things you buy low and sell high, they think.  Tech crypto has been in the backseat. Having less capital to throw at lobbying and policymaking, being less sophisticated with the ways of Washington, D.C., and not having as many existential regulatory questions pending, tech crypto has a much lower profile. Most legislators have heard of ether and its meteoric price rise. Few understand that Ethereum is a computing platform. Almost no one understands the protocols being built on it.  But the balance in advocacy is very much shifting, which should make for a smarter discussion. And this shift is not by accident. Tech crypto sees regulators now scrutinizing peer-to-peer networks, unhosted wallets, smart contracts and the like. The specter of peer-to-peer (P2P) regulation is now on the horizon, and therefore as a matter of growing necessity tech crypto is committing more resources into policy development and advocacy.  See also: Coinbase Deal Shows Google Is Committed to Crypto | Opinion  We see this trend manifested in the recent response to the Digital Asset Commodity Consumer Protection Act, which sits with committees in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. While money crypto – especially a considerably active major CeFi player that will remain nameless – has been pushing for its passage, tech crypto has been howling that vague and ambiguous provisions would permit the CFTC plenary authority to regulate P2P protocols. Those criticisms have put the bill sponsors and some in money crypto at a disadvantage. That is a good sign.  As tech crypto starts playing a more important role in the conversation, we should embrace both sides. Neither is good or bad – rather, their relationship is symbiotic. Most people only care about tech crypto because money crypto has helped the price go up, and the price goes up only because tech crypto is making something that enough people believe may actually change the world for the better. Yet, acting like they are the same frustrates a competent debate of the policy issues.  It also confuses regulators. If there is no gap between money crypto and tech crypto, then regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have a rhetorical basis to prescribe the same regulatory solution across both spaces.  “Because we obviously get to regulate the investment side, we should regulate the tech side, too,” is the logic. Properly framing the two sides would ideally result in agencies acting more like FinCEN has to date. That agency in 2020 saw a rushed rule looking to hobble unhosted wallets, and properly resisted (to the extent they were able) their U.S. Treasury Department bosses. They knew that their congressional mandate could be extended to money crypto, which often engages in money services business, but extending their supervision to tech crypto was beyond their authority.  A coherent approach would mean addressing money crypto regulation first and then getting to tech crypto later. Money crypto is much more readily regulated. While we may be far from great at it, we have experience regulating intermediated financial systems. We could and should prioritize working out all the messy but important details, including custodial requirements, know-your-customer (KYC) and balance sheet transparency, that must be resolved in CeFi. By focusing on a properly regulated CeFi first, we would address that part of crypto which is undeniably larger, more exposed to retail, and more connected with TradFi.  Read more: The Ethereum Killers Are All Zombies Now | Opinion  While we are doing that, we can evolve our views and hopefully reach greater consensus about risks and mitigation strategies relating to the global, permissionless P2P crypto space. This approach makes sense in no small part because of how early in its evolution DeFi is, and the near certainty that it will meaningfully evolve over the coming years. Some of that change will inevitably address many risks we see today.  We should be more appropriately reactive when it comes to money crypto versus tech crypto. Advocates should mobilize swiftly to confront the folly of any law or regulation that seeks to expand the definition of a virtual asset service provider (VASP) or a crypto asset service provider (CASP) to technology providers or platforms. When we hear “same rules for DeFi and CeFi,” we should call out the flaw and the resulting policy incoherence.  While their differences are important, money crypto and tech crypto need each other. In the short and medium term, tech crypto gets a massive influx of ideas, energy and talent because of investment interest. These are the most important ingredients to keep marching the path of innovation. Money crypto needs these protocols to win over the long term for these tokens to actually be worth something. But these two sides of crypto are not the same, and both our engagement approach and policy goals should reflect that.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Bill Hughes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/07/money-crypto-versus-tech-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e7795d651e9557cd135fd6bd1ddfde360808c62-5650x3767.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394105,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXld5,1667845536,Why NFT Artists Shouldn't Expect 'Royalties',"After months of silence, the largest non-fungible token exchange, OpenSea, announced it is taking the middle road on “royalties” paid to NFT creators. The move will likely reshape an ongoing debate as to whether these digital assets should automatically pay out “creator fees” when resold (which benefits artists) or nix that standard entirely (which is better for traders).  OpenSea’s new “on-chain enforcement” tool is essentially a snippet of code that NFT creators can add when building their smart contracts that will ensure they continue to receive a cut of the proceeds every time an NFT exchanges hands. This bucks the trend of marketplaces like X2Y2, LooksRare and SudoSwap that have eliminated or minimized a royalty system.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  As OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer wrote in an accompanying blog, when the NFT standard was introduced in 2018 royalties were pitched as a way to benefit a new class of creators who would otherwise be cut out of the growing value of their work. But then, as now, there was no actual mechanism that would ensure this form of ongoing compensation would take place.  Read more: Opensea Launches First Royalty Enforcement Tool Amid NFT Marketplace Drama  OpenSea, and other early-to-market NFT exchanges, introduced “creator fees” in an attempt to attract builders to the industry. It began a core part of NFTs’ value proposition: You only need to hear so many accounts of artists who starve as their body of work increases in value to see why royalties, paid out in secondary markets, would be attractive.  “Until now, the primary thesis for this remarkable technology has been ensuring that artists get paid for their work,” Bobby “Bobby Hundreds” Kim, co-founder of fashion brand The Hundreds, said on Twitter. This thesis, however, has largely relied on exchanges to enforce it (and on the good graces of buyers to not find ways around it).  Beginning this summer, several NFT exchanges began to cut out royalties or treat them more like optional tips buyers could pay. This obviously angered several NFT artists who had begun to rely on the income stream, especially considering the market downturn. Eliminating or downsizing royalties benefits exchanges, also affected by the bear market’s dwindling trade volumes, and buyers.  While Bobby Hundreds is probably right to say “abandoning creator royalties throws the entire mission of Web3/NFTs off,” the move itself could be seen as healthy for the industry.  First, as mentioned, NFTs do not programmatically pay out fees to their original creators (though they could be upgraded to do so, if there was the will). By making tipping optional, exchanges are aligning with the actual technology rather than a cultural expectation. Creating or selling NFTs on a false pretense is bad, and the only way for royalties to work 100% of the time would require everyone to agree.  Second, NFTs are a general purpose technology and serve a variety of functions. Paying 5%-10% fees to companies like Ticketmaster, if they adopt the tech in time, seems gross. There are many types of NFT makers and market participants. Traders, operating on slim margins and moving price floors, were already finding workarounds to royalties.  Artists have boycotted some exchanges that moved away from royalties. For instance, X2YX has seen trading volume drop from 11,540 ETH on Aug. 26, the day it ditched royalties, to 547 ETH, Decrypt reported. “A month ago, around 75% of NFT buyers opted-in to paying royalties on [X2Y2], when given the choice,” Punk 9059 tweeted. “Now that number is around 18%.”  OpenSea’s new tool makes it easier for creators of new NFT collections to blacklist non-royalty exchanges. Some have called this move anti-competitive. It’s certainly self-serving, and a way to endear itself to the vocal NFT arts community. But seems like a practical solution considering the actual tech behind NFTs.  See also: Brokerage Firm Bernstein Says NFTs Are Not Dead  “In our opinion, by far the better option is for existing creators to explore new forms of monetization and alternative ways of incentivizing buyers and sellers to pay creator fees, and to ensure that future collections enforce creator fees on-chain,” Finzer, the OpenSea CEO, wrote. Exchanges too can create systems that incentivize tipping – like Blur’s token airdrops to fee payers.  (OpenSea’s on-chain system for new or editable collections will take effect on Nov. 8. It will decide whether to expand the tool to existing collections, and take on community feedback, on and until Dec. 8.)  Although there are strong arguments for indefinite creator fees, it was always unsustainable for artists to rely on exchanges to honor this system. The industry should foster a culture where tipping is expected. But unless put into code, no one should expect the rules to be enforced.

42422001,jjC679rdH2yAqYFcxQCSjv,1667844899,Here’s What Crypto Traders Expect From the Midterms,"After two years of Democratic Party control of the U.S. presidency and both legislative chambers, Republicans look poised to take control of the House of Representatives and maybe the Senate in Tuesday’s midterm elections.  The state of the economy plays a big role in whether people are happy with their government. Right now things could be better, with inflation still roughly four times the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Republicans have pinned much of the blame on President Joe Biden and his coronavirus pandemic stimulus packages.  “This was the largest fiscal and monetary response in history and that’s great, but elements of how it was delivered weren’t the best and we probably overdid it,” Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, told Politico earlier this year. On the other hand, Alan S. Blinder, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, wrote in the Wall Street Journal in June that inflation started rising because of COVID-19, oil prices and food prices, and ""not because of anything Mr. Biden did.""  Most people who want jobs have plenty of options, but rising short-term U.S. Treasury bond yields and a struggling stock market could point toward more tumultuous times ahead – especially with Federal Reserve officials signaling recently they may have to double down on monetary tightening.  “Economic priorities and inflation have returned as the core political issues defining the last stretch of the race,” researchers at investment bank and financial services company Raymond James & Associates wrote in a note.  As a result, financial markets, including crypto assets, will likely see some volatility this week as traders monitor the results, starting with exit polls on Tuesday night.  CoinDesk spoke with a few analysts and traders and compiled some of their key thoughts and predictions on the midterm elections.  Howard Greenberg of Prosper Trading Academy: “A win by the Republican Party would be considered positive for crypto on two different fronts. First, a split leadership is considered to be positive for the markets as the fear of legislation through reconciliation dissipates, and there will be more debate on fiscal policy moving forward. The second positive would be that we have seen many bills on crypto regulation stall out over the last 12 months. The change in leadership in Congress and Senate could lead to more cooperation and coordination between the parties providing a more conducive atmosphere to get some legislation passed.”  Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange brokerage Oanda: “Crypto traders might get taken on another roller-coaster ride this week as two big events could trigger a major move for markets. ... If the Democrats somehow keep both chambers, that should be bullish for the dollar and bad news for cryptos. If the Republicans win the House or both chambers, that should be positive for risky assets, especially cryptos. A red wave over the short term could mean that we won't see a fiscal response from the Biden administration once the economy falls into a recession. A Republican sweep would be most bullish for Treasurys and put pressure on the dollar. It won't be a long-lasting trend as a Republican sweep increases the odds that debt ceiling talks could provide unwanted pressure on every risky asset.”  Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko: “It seems likely that markets would most favor a Republican sweep, as they have generally been more lenient towards the industry. But I wouldn’t expect a rally based on the results, as legislation and regulation move slowly and the bills with most traction have been bipartisan anyway.”  Brian Overby, senior markets strategist at Ally: “Traders do not foresee excessive market swings after voters head to the polls next Tuesday. ... While the elections almost always create an extra layer of uncertainty in markets, midterms often result in a positive run for stocks, which appears to be already underway.”  Fundstrat’s Tom Lee wrote in a note that Republicans taking over the Senate would be deflationary partly due to the fiscal restraint.

42394122,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXmhl,1667844603,The Crypto Revolution’s ‘Turning Point’,"If you haven’t read “Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital” (2002) by Carlota Perez, I thoroughly recommend it. It’s a boring title for a mind-blowing book with beautiful language that is almost guaranteed to trigger a sequence of “aha!” moments, whatever industry you happen to be working in.  Her main thesis is that major technological shifts follow a pattern that takes them from creation through to obsolescence, launching “golden ages” of progress and prosperity along the rather bumpy way. She divides the sequence into five sections:  The Irruption Phase begins with an initial surge of interest in the new, shiny thing against a backdrop of stagnation and turmoil.  In the Frenzy Phase, speculation starts to dominate the headlines as financial capital takes over while use-case exploration intensifies.  The Turning Point tends to come as the bubble of the Frenzy Phase bursts, leading to a recession, and is usually characterized by greater involvement from regulators as well as other sectors of society.  The Synergy Phase kicks off the “deployment period,” which leverages the investment of the Frenzy and the infrastructure progress of the Turning Point into an expansion of economies of scale with financial capital more directly tied to production.  The Maturity Phase is the twilight of the curve as the limitations of the new technology start to generate friction, eventually leading to stagnation and turmoil.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  The crypto industry is clearly at the Turning Point in the above framework. It’s not just the recent bursting of the Frenzy Phase that makes this obvious – it’s also the headlines that cross our screens every day, with their emphasis on regulatory exploration, infrastructure build and new ecosystem participants. Some could try to argue that 2018 was the Turning Point, but the technology was still too immature back then, the global acceptance still too thin and the bear market too “dry” in terms of meaningful development.  The entrance of institutional and other types of investors in 2021 and the rapid growth of high-yield crypto products triggered a level of speculation much more widespread than the initial coin offering (ICO) craze of 2017, masking significant progress on crypto deployment, which in the Turning Point is taking on a heightened protagonism.  Some of Perez’s observations about the Turning Point seem eerily prescient (all quotes from her book):  “The Turning Point has to do with the balance between individual and social interests within capitalism. It is the swing of the pendulum from the extreme individualism of Frenzy to giving greater attention to collective well-being.”  “This switch does not occur for ideological or voluntaristic reasons but as the result of the way in which the installation of a new paradigm takes place.”  “The Turning Point … is a crucial crossroads, usually a serious recession, involving a recomposition of the whole system, in particular of the regulatory context that enables the resumption of growth and the full fructification of the technological revolution.”  “The Turning Point then is a space for social rethinking and reconsidering.”  See also: Bitcoin Is Macro, but Not 'Correlated' in the Way You Think | Opinion  It’s important to note that Perez is not attempting to predict the future. She is condensing the experience of five previous technological revolutions going back to the 1700s (factory production, steam/railway, steel/electricity, oil/cars/mass production and telecommunication) into recognizable patterns. And yet she could just as easily be talking about the evolution of the crypto industry to date, even though it did not exist at time of publication. If the pattern she describes holds, the current stage is about to unleash a wave of adoption and acceptance that will shape a “golden age” of prosperity – such as those birthed by previous waves of tech innovation. That, in turn, could unleash not just greater efficiencies and access but also a new social structure.  It’s not hard to see a parallel to what famed macro investor Ray Dalio has been saying for some time: that we are near a fundamental paradigm shift as our societal systems become unstable, crumble and leave room for a new framework to emerge phoenix-like from the ashes.  According to Perez’s research, the Turning Point lasts anywhere between a few months to a few years, so we could have a way to go yet before the “deployment period” kicks off. But the tone and pace of recent progress suggests the transition is underway.  The Turning Point initiates a shift from “financial capital,” which prioritizes short-term gain, to “production capital” which focuses more on development. In crypto, production capital has been plugging away all along. But its prominence has recently changed. Rather than celebrations of record prices and assets under management (AUM) growth, headlines these days are more focused on technological leaps forward as much of the recent behind-the-scenes work is brought to light, setting the stage for a new phase of growth.  See also: The Myth of 'Regulatory Clarity' | Opinion  Ethereum’s Merge is perhaps the most high-profile example. The flurry of projects building on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is another. There’s also progress on cross-chain interoperability, milestones reached by zero-knowledge rollup scaling technology, the launch of layer 1 blockchains, funding for new types of custody systems, known financial names launching crypto products, legacy banks and investment funds kicking the tires on blockchain-based security issuance, and much more.  Another key feature of Turning Points is the design of regulatory frameworks that have been conspicuously absent during the first two initial phases. We are certainly seeing this now, with the arduous progress of the European Union’s set of crypto rules (known as MiCA) and the response of many official U.S. agencies to President Joe Biden’s executive order mandating a comprehensive approach to digital asset regulation. There’s also the global focus on stablecoins and many local initiatives regarding crypto asset trading, as well as the recognition that international coordination would make illicit transactions easier to block.  So, why is all this important? Because it gives us reassurance that the current turmoil is merely a painful phase on the path to better times. We tend to misunderstand the meaning of the word “revolution” – taken literally, it means the coverage of a full cycle, a return to origin in order to begin anew. While the cycles outlined do not “return to origin,” they do follow a pattern that sketches out the likely evolution of the new technologies we grapple with today. In so doing, they give our current macro and crypto turmoil a refreshing perspective. Things may look bleak at the moment and many will suffer, which is never good. But the historical context colors the pervasive uncertainty with the comforting rhythm of history.  The patterns described also help us to see the significance of the recent shift in the ecosystem’s expectations. While we may lament the loss of our recent heyday with abundant profits and creative overreach, we can feel reassured that what we are going through is a necessary phase to weed out the hype and focus on real-world impact. We’ve been here before and, through the lens of history, it turned out well.  However, Perez’s book includes a description of the Turning Point that could be taken as a warning:  “It can establish institutions for increasing social cohesiveness, improving income distribution and general well-being or it can try to reinstate the ‘selfish prosperity’ of the frenzy phase, though more closely connected with real production and finding some means to expand demand,” she writes.  We seem to be on the path to the former scenario. The damage done by the collapse of the Terra stablecoin ecosystem, the Three Arrows Capital hedge fund and some crypto lenders left deep scars that, combined with intensifying regulatory scrutiny as well as self-governance, will no doubt influence risk attitudes for at least a while. Take into account the tone of crypto headlines of late with their heavy emphasis on infrastructure, governance and partnerships, and a picture emerges of an industry with strong conviction, broadening acceptance and the growing involvement of different sections of society.  The Synergy Phase with its optimistic promise may be some ways ahead still. But we are heading toward it.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/07/the-crypto-revolutions-turning-point,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99c281890ea73be848059172cb17f2d8d816538b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The central bank had recently completed a 10-month experiment into a digital South Korean won, Governor Chang Yong Rhee revealed in a September speech.  During the project, the bank also tested the use of its CBDC to purchase non-fungible tokens (NFT), according to the report.  Major economies such as the U.S., U.K. and European Union have been exploring the issuance of CBDCs, while China has already carried out several trials. South Korea began its CBDC trial last year and completed the first of two phases by January.  In his speech, Rhee said that some decisions about a digital won required ""trade-offs.""  ""We have realized that there is no such thing as perfect technology or CBDC designs that can satisfy all the various goals and expectations at the same time,"" Rhee said.  For instance, the bank made a decision to ""improve compliance at the sacrifice of privacy,"" Rhee said.  BoK established a virtual money laundering and terrorism financing monitoring system and will facilitate data submission, Yonhap News reported.  The experiment found that a CBDC could process up to 2,000 transactions per second, Yonhap News reported. However, it also found that distributed ledger technology, which underlies crypto, does not yet have the scalability needed for a retail CBDC, Rhee said in his speech. So it may be better to use the standard centralized ledger database, he added.  In July, BoK announced it was working on ""real world"" tests of a CBDC with ten commercial banks.

The reason for the notice of default, which the lender sent to the miner on Nov. 4, is the company failed to engage in ""good faith restructuring discussions"" for the debt in question, according to a Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Because Iris failed to engage in such discussions, the lender is claiming it defaulted on payments originally scheduled for Oct. 25, the Monday filing said. As such, the filing continued, the lender looks to trigger an acceleration clause, meaning it is demanding immediate payment of the entire principal and accrued interest. Iris said it ""disagrees"" with the allegations made by the lender in the Nov. 4 notice.  To review, on Nov. 2, Iris Energy said the bitcoin mining machines in question do not produce enough cash to cover the related debt obligations. The company said at that time that if discussions to restructure the debt fail to lead to an agreement by Nov. 8, it would not be able to meet the debt obligations held by the two SPVs.  The two loans in question – which as of Sept. 30 had principal amounts of $32 million and $71 million – are secured by 1.6 exahash/second (EH/s) and 2.0 EH/s of mining machines, respectively, the company said. The debt is held by two wholly-owned, non-recourse SPVs, meaning in the event of default the lender will not be able to seize any Iris Energy assets other than the collateral.  The loans appear to be from troubled lender NYDIG, based on past press releases.  Iris Energy is one of several bitcoin mining firms struggling to repay their debt obligations during this bear market that has seen rewards dwindle alongside soaring energy costs. September saw the first Chapter 11 bankruptcy from a major player, Compute North, with other big firms including Core Scientific (CORZ) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) seemingly teetering on the edge of solvency.  In the Monday filing there's also a third loan for $1 million – also held by a wholly owned SPV and secured by 0.2 EH/s of miners – that received a different notice for another potential event of default from the lender.  If an agreement for restructuring the debt is not reached by Tuesday, Iris Energy will not provide further financing support to the SPVs, said the company, likely leading to default and foreclosing of assets.  Only 2.4 EH/s of the the company's machines are unaffected by the equipment loans.  Iris shares are up marginally late on Monday morning, trading at $2.80 each.  CORRECTION AND UPDATE (Nov. 7, 22:53 UTC): Corrects description in the fourth paragraph of non-recourse financing to say that in the event of default the lender will not be able to seize any assets other than the collateral; adds detail about NYDIG in the fifth paragraph.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | SPONSORED | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/07/bitcoin-miner-iris-energy-faces-default-claim-on-103m-of-equipment-loans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef9df8202bf0fc293ea27c79dea656ba7ac0d055-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422000,jjC679rdH2yAqYFcxQCSkh,1667837831,"LBRY Sold Tokens as Securities, Federal Judge Rules","Crypto startup LBRY violated securities laws by selling its native LBC tokens without registering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a New Hampshire judge ruled on Monday.  The SEC sued LBRY in March 2021, alleging that LBC tokens were securities and that the startup had violated securities laws by selling them without registering with the agency. LBRY pushed back, claiming that LBC tokens were not securities, and that the SEC did not give it fair notice that its sale of LBC was subject to securities laws, thus violating the company’s right to due process. The LBRY protocol is a blockchain-based file-sharing network.  Federal Judge Paul Barbadoro, of the District Court for the District of New Hampshire, ruled Monday that “no reasonable trier of fact could reject the SEC’s contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security, and LBRY does not have a triable defense that it lacked fair notice.”  LBRY founder Jeremy Kauffman has long maintained that the outcome of the case could have sweeping implications for the wider crypto industry. Speaking at Messari’s Mainnet conference in September, Kauffman said the facts in LBRY’s case would “basically apply to every company” in the crypto industry.  In an emailed statement, Kauffman reiterated his claim that the case can have a broader impact on the industry.  ""The SEC vs LBRY case establishes a precedent that threatens the entire US cryptocurrency industry. Under the SEC vs LBRY standard, almost every cryptocurrency, including Ethereum and Doge, are securities. The future of cryptocurrency in the US now rests in with an organization even worse than the SEC: the United States Congress,"" he said.  One significant case the LBRY ruling could impact is the SEC’s suit against Ripple Labs and two of its executives, who have been charged with selling $1.3 billion in unregistered securities. Much like LBRY, Ripple Labs’ defense has hinged on its claim that its native token XRP is not a security, and that, by failing to provide clarity on whether XRP was a security, the SEC did not provide fair notice that Ripple Labs’ conduct was unlawful.  Several major players in the crypto industry including Coinbase and the Blockchain Association have filed amicus briefs in support of Ripple Labs, arguing that the securities laws have been inconsistently applied by the regulator, creating “uncertainty” for the entire industry.  In its initial complaint against LBRY, the SEC asked the court for a permanent injunction to prevent LBRY from selling more LBC tokens, disgorgement of its “ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgement interest,” and other civil monetary penalties.  The judge’s ruling on Monday means that LBRY’s case will not go to trial. A status hearing to determine next steps is slated for Nov. 21.

42422008,jjC679rdH2yAqYFcxQCSq7,1667832596,How Digital Assets Get Into Investable Indices,"Since the inception of bitcoin in 2008, the digital asset industry has been growing at a rapid pace, accelerating the emergence of the new digital finance economy. This booming new asset class has resulted in the development of new investment vehicles and opportunities with thousands of different projects, use cases and applications using blockchain technology to transform industry infrastructure. While there is a wide range of estimates on the number of existing cryptocurrencies, the growth is clear. As of Oct. 26, 2022, coinmarketcap.com, coingecko.com and investing.com listed 21,522, 13,260, and 9,409 coins, respectively.  Number of Cryptocurrencies Worldwide From 2013 to August 2022  This extraordinary growth has created a commensurate amount of complexity. To help investors better understand the digital asset space, CoinDesk Indices introduced the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). DACS provides the market with a reliable structure and transparency to help classify and simplify the industries inside the asset class. DACS also serves as the fundamental framework and foundation that supports CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) benchmarks for performance measurement and CoinDesk Select Indices for building investment strategies.  This paper covers our process of narrowing the universe of digital assets for investable indices. It outlines how DACS defines and organizes industries for digital asset categorization, then reviews minimum eligibility for inclusion in benchmarks to provide market measurements. It finally describes the stricter criteria for inclusion in investable indices.  CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS)  Using a classification standard to define markets is not a new concept. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), developed by MSCI and Standard & Poor’s in 1999, has been widely used by equity investors to classify publicly traded companies globally. Research shows GICS explains stock return co-movements within sectors, helping investors determine important drivers for company valuations, identify relative value opportunities by comparing companies in the same sector and develop sector level macro insights to make decisions on asset allocation.  Furthermore, sector indices developed based on GICS have become the backbone of investor allocation, risk and performance-evaluation models. According to a recent Index Industry Association (IIA) benchmark survey, approximately 1.47 million sector- or industry-based indices are calculated daily, which is nearly half of all available equity indices. This truly speaks to the power of GICS to modernize equity investing.  While DACS is unique to digital assets, it serves many of the same functions as classification systems used for traditional asset classes. Among other things, DACS provides the market with a transparent and standardized method to determine sector and industry exposure, facilitate portfolio attribution analysis and help pinpoint investment opportunities.  DACS is designed to define and organize the industries of digital assets to enable each of the top 500 eligible digital assets by market capitalization to be assigned to an industry based on its use case and technology. Then, each industry is assigned to an industry group and each industry group is assigned to a sector. This classification currently results in a three-tiered hierarchy. The industry, industry group and sector definitions in the DACS glossary provide a common language for the industry. The definitions set the framework for the standard taxonomy of digital assets.  To be included in DACS, digital assets must be covered by CoinMarketCap.com and ranked in the top 500 digital assets. However, any asset with significantly contested or disputed circulating supply data, lack of transparency in the form of public documentation and white papers, or assets that are no longer in operation or have been restructured will be excluded from DACS. Moreover, assets that are considered a gas token, staked token or wrapped are not currently eligible for inclusion in DACS.  The assignment of an industry to a digital asset is based on the asset’s actual or intended use case or application. This is determined by reviewing available documentation or white papers on the project’s website, its social media channels, on-chain activity, third party audits, peer reviews or other publicly available information.  Once the use case and/or application has been determined, the digital asset will be assigned to the most appropriate Industry, using the definitions in the Glossary. The Industry assignment will be guided by identifying the dominant use case or application of the digital asset and identifying digital assets with similar use cases or applications.  Industry definitions as defined in the Glossary may require modifications because they are intended to account for new use cases or applications not previously considered. The definitions should reflect accurately current terminology in the digital asset space and provide clarifications, increase transparency and improve consistency.  The DACS structure will also be modified as needed to capture the evolution of the digital asset market. These changes may include expanding or collapsing the number of sectors, industry groups or industries. The changes might also involve migrating industry groups or industries within the DACS hierarchy as well as material changes to existing definitions used to classify a digital asset.  Any modification to the DACS structure will be announced publicly with appropriate lead time prior to implementation. These changes are generally determined based on market input and feedback. To facilitate these discussions, CoinDesk Indices may issue public consultations to provide analysis and proposals seeking feedback to help inform its final decision. Additionally, the DACS Advisory Council is composed of key digital asset market participants and other influential individuals within the digital asset space to assist CoinDesk Indices in determining potential changes to the DACS structure.  Lastly, DACS is governed by the DACS Committee, which is responsible for the oversight of the DACS structure, definitions, and classifications. Material changes to the DACS structure and/or DACS Methodology must be reviewed and approved by the DACS Committee prior to implementation.  Although DACS serves a vital role in defining, organizing and categorizing the industries and digital assets based on their use cases and technology to provide a common language and standard taxonomy to classify tokens, it is unable to measure markets to support investment strategy. Therefore, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) Family was developed to enable performance measurement of the broad digital asset market and its segments.  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) Family  Benchmark indices are often the most underrated yet most powerful drivers of returns. This is because indices are used throughout the investment process at nearly every critical decision-making stage. First, indices are often used as the asset class proxy in asset allocation models to decide how much to allocate for a given set of goals. Then, benchmarks are used to find managers that outperform or are uncorrelated so the money can be put to work. Managers often use the constituents of the benchmark as their starting universe and further use the benchmark sector and constituent weights as the anchor to overweight or underweight positions, or even go short for hedge funds, in their strategies. Beyond the technical data, the industry fundamentals are used in sector- or factor-focused rotation strategies and for peer group valuations. Then, in post-investment analysis, benchmarks help answer the question whether managers did a good job.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) and its subindices are a family of broad-based digital asset indices designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market. The family includes indices that reflect sectors defined in DACS.  The CMI Methodology narrows the DACS digital asset universe by requiring minimum pricing, then market cap weighting the eligible assets. There are four major eligibility criteria for assets to be included in the CMI family:  1. Inclusion in the latest DACS report  2. Must be listed on at least two eligible exchanges  3. Must be listed on an Eligible Exchange* for a minimum of 30 days  4. Pricing must be available by a CoinDesk reference price**  The constituents that meet the above four requirements are then weighted by market capitalization. They are reconstituted and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The CMI index family is calculated in real time using reference rates for each asset.  Given that the goal of CMI is to be as broad as possible, it aims to capture all digital assets that meet the Eligibility Criteria including stablecoins and meme coins. It provides a broad representation of the performance of the digital asset market and its segments. Therefore, it may include digital assets that are relatively illiquid or otherwise difficult to access, own, trade or custody. Digital assets that meet all eligibility criteria are included regardless of their designation as a security by a government agency.  Currently, the CMI eligibility criteria narrows the 500 digital assets assigned by DACS to 150 digital assets, covering 89% of the market cap. While CMI serves a solid role in performance measurement for various use cases, it is generally not replicable for tracking products like funds or derivatives. Therefore, the CoinDesk Select Indices were created to deliver investable index strategies.  CoinDesk Select Indices  The innovations in financial products from derivatives to ETFs and now tokenized funds have increased demand for investable indices that serve as the underlying strategies for these tracking products. Although the growth of index strategies has exploded in traditional and alternative asset classes, the digital asset indices that are intended to underpin investment products are relatively new due to specific requirements by investors. Therefore, the CoinDesk Select Indices are designed to measure the performance of some of the largest and most liquid digital assets classified in DACS that meet certain trading and custody requirements.  Generally, the CoinDesk Select Indices*** include five to 10 assets that meet stricter eligibility criteria than the simple availability of pricing and market cap data. There are four major eligibility criteria to determine the Select Index Universe:  1. The digital asset must be ranked in the top 200 in the latest published DACS report.  2. Custodian services for the digital asset must be available from Coinbase Custody, a division of Coinbase Global Inc., and the digital asset must be accessible by U.S. investors.  3. The digital asset must not be a stablecoin or categorized as a meme coin as determined by CDI.  4. The digital asset must have been listed on an Eligible Exchange for a minimum of 30 days.  Next, the top 20 digital assets from the Index Universe are ranked by market cap to determine Selection Universe before the constituents are chosen. Five to 10 digital assets are included from the Selection Universe by their median daily value traded and median market cap, where higher thresholds are required for non-constituents than for incumbent constituents. The median daily value traded and median market cap values need to be greater than or equal to 1.2 times the 30-day median for non-constituents, and constituents need to have greater than or equal to the 30-day median for constituents. Non-constituents must be on Watchlist by passing all eligibility criteria for one quarter ahead of the quarter a digital asset may be added to the index.  While the selected assets may be weighted in various ways including by market cap, equally weighted or risk weighted, the market cap weighted results generally maintain the sector exposures in proportion to the broad set of digital assets. The process in narrowing the universe from 500 digital assets assigned in DACS to currently 150 digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) and further to the current set of 28 assets in the Select Sectors enables investors to access the market beta with relatively few assets. Because the digital asset market is still emerging and highly concentrated, the set of fewer assets covers most of the market cap with just over 5% (28 digital assets) of assets covering nearly 75% of the entire market cap.  Conclusion  The incredible growth in digital assets beyond bitcoin has created numerous investment opportunities across the new economy. However, finding those investment opportunities in the sea of digital assets requires a deep understanding of use cases and technology combined with expertise about Investability. Narrowing the digital asset universe by pricing availability, liquidity, exchange and custodial requirements is critical to determine which digital assets are appropriate for quality investors. The methodical practices developed to organize the digital asset universe and select the largest and most liquid constituents representing the asset class and its sectors may help investors throughout their investment processes.

42421992,jjC679rdH2yAqYFcxQCSdj,1667832211,US Seizes 50K Bitcoins Related to Silk Road Marketplace,"Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Monday that authorities seized 50,676 bitcoins related to the darknet marketplace Silk Road in November.  The bitcoin was valued at $3.36 billion at the time it was discovered. Now it is worth $1.04 billion. In November, it was the largest cryptocurrency seizure to date, but has since been surpassed by the 70,000 bitcoins seized in February in relation to a hack of the Bitfinex crypto exchange.  In the Silk Road case, the coins were found at an address in Georgia connected with James Zhong. The feds also found $661,900 in cash as well as various precious metals. Zhong pleaded guilty to committing wire fraud in 2012, according to a statement from the Justice Department on Monday.  ""This case shows that we won’t stop following the money, no matter how expertly hidden, even to a circuit board in the bottom of a popcorn tin,” Williams said in the statement.  The Silk Road was an illegal marketplace on the darknet that operated between 2011 and 2013 and that primarily used bitcoin as a method of payment. The site collapsed following the arrest of its operator, Ross Ulbricht, who is serving a double life sentence and 40 years in prison, without the possibility of parole.  In 2014, U.S. marshals auctioned off several tranches of seized bitcoin, with 50,000 coins being sold for $20 million followed by a 30,000-coin auction a few months earlier.  Zhong manipulated Silk Road's withdrawal system by triggering 140 transactions in rapid succession, fooling the system into crediting several external wallets with the bitcoin, according to the Justice Department.

Zhao tweeted that Binance will sell all of the remaining FTT (FTX’s native token) that it received last year as part of its exit from FTX equity.

Canadian bitcoin miner Hive Blockchain appears to be in better shape than many of its mining peers. The firm has 3,311 BTC worth $68.8 million, and, unlike several rivals, it has no debt-servicing payments related to digital assets or its mining equipment. The crypto market slump in recent months has hit mining firms hard, with share prices tanking and companies seeking means to manage liquidity and debt.  Stablecoin issuer Paxos is eyeing a major hiring push in Singapore, where it last week received a license to offer crypto products and services. The firm plans to add more than 130 employees to its current staff of 20 over the next three years, making the city-state its hub for growth outside its U.S. home. Paxos is one of the few crypto companies that are bucking the trend of the wider story in the digital-assets industry, which has been dominated by layoffs as a result of the market downturn.

42422007,jjC679rdH2yAqYFcxQCSpL,1667826321,"CBDCs May Need Global Regulation, EU Commissioner Says","Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) may require a network of international deals to stop state-backed money from infringing on other countries’ sovereignty, European Union Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said on Monday.  The bloc of 27 nations is considering a digital version of the euro, but needs to resolve issues such as how a digital euro will work for cross-border payments.  “How do you avoid the risk of infringing the sovereignty of other jurisdictions through a digital currency … while developing a digital currency with global ambition, as the digital euro will be?” said Gentiloni, who is responsible for economic policy at the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. Gentiloni was speaking at a conference on the digital euro organized by the Commission and the European Central Bank.  “This, of course, brings the possibility of specific agreements with other jurisdictions regulating this kind of dimension,” he added.  In October 2021, the Group of Seven major industrialized nations warned that countries that are developing digital versions of their fiat currency need to be wary about treading on other jurisdictions.  EU policymakers have also raised the risk that easy access to a digital euro from overseas could undermine the currency, much like the dollarization of states that adopt U.S. currency without the Federal Reserve’s permission.  The International Monetary Fund has also raised the possibility of an international CBDC platform that could ease cross-border payments but that is now beset by delays and costs.  Gentiloni’s remarks at a conference in Brussels drew an immediate response – including from the Bahamas, one of the few countries that has already rolled out its own CBDC, the sand dollar.  “It is critical that any cross-border initiative, taken in regards to the work on CBDCs, reflects an inclusive approach to the needs that will be expressed by the Bahamas and small countries in this arena,” John Rolle, governor of the Bahamas’ central bank, told the conference.

42411064,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBVdq,1667826000,"In Praise of White-Hat Hackers, but Overreliance Is Foolish","In August, Nomad, a platform that allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchains, fell victim to a hack that drained its users of nearly $200 million.  Instructions on how to execute the attack spread like wildfire across Twitter, turning a one-off heist into a free-for-all open to anyone who could copy and paste a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain.  As black-hat hackers ran away with millions, so-called “white hats” – good Samaritans – looted the funds so that they could return them to Nomad. Altogether, the grassroots rescue effort kept more than $38.5 million out of the hands of attackers.  White-hat hackers play a critical role in securing the Web3 ecosystem, and yet, according to DarkFi.eth – one of the hackers who exploited Nomad in order to rescue its funds from attackers – altruistic hackers aren’t paid enough and operate in an unclear legal landscape.  Nomad x DarkFi case study  DarkFi.eth (not related to DarkFi, the layer 1 blockchain with the Lunarpunk philosophy) was one of the white hats who stole and subsequently returned roughly $2 million from the Nomad bridge.  When DarkFi saw suspicious transactions flowing into and out of the Nomad bridge smart contract, the hacker copied and pasted the format of those similar-looking transactions into his own, new transactions. Suddenly, some of Nomad’s funds – funds that technically belonged to Nomad’s users – appeared in DarkFi’s crypto wallet.  The pseudonymous hacker quickly snapped into action, recalling in an interview with CoinDesk that he noticed the “potential to get some more of this money out [of Nomad] before it’s taken by other malicious actors.”  DarkFi repeated the buggy transaction several times (one, two, three, four, five).  Intent aside, DarkFi and other white hats performed exactly the same steps as the Nomad exploiters: withdrawing funds without the owners’ permission.  DarkFi wanted to rescue more money, but he said he “basically held off on taking more” because he was “worried about the repercussions of doing it.”  “Even though I fully intended to return the money, it was still kind of unclear,” DarkFi said.  White hats and black hats  Hackers who scan software code to identify potential vulnerabilities are identified by their metaphorical white and black hats.  Black hats deliberately exploit the vulnerabilities that they find – looting crypto, blackmailing businesses or selling their discoveries to an underground criminal marketplace. Stephen Tong, co-founder of security audit firm Zellic.io, calls these hackers “mercenaries.”  “Black hats are simply looking out for themselves most of the time, whether that’s for profit or entertainment,” Tong told CoinDesk in an interview.  “White hats, on the other hand, are strictly trying to do the right thing. They’re trying to act in good faith,” he said.  In the context of Web3, white hats typically alert protocol developers once they discover a bug that needs patching. In exchange for responsibly disclosing bugs, protocols generally reward white hats with some kind of a bounty.  Sometimes, as in the case of Nomad, white hats will discover a bug so severe they decide to exploit it themselves – securing at-risk funds and returning the funds to the protocol before they can be stolen by someone with ill intent.  In these cases, when a hacker’s original intent is difficult to suss out (perhaps they returned the funds only out of fear of law enforcement), how – and whether – they should be compensated can become difficult for a protocol to decide.  Vulnerability disclosure issue  DarkFi highlighted a common issue for white hats: vulnerability disclosure.  When a hacker knows a protocol is vulnerable with funds at risk of withdrawal without the permission of the owners, two options arise for the hacker:  Exploit the vulnerability to secure the funds himself with the intention of giving it back  Alert the project without exploiting the vulnerability  If a white hat took the first option and exploited the vulnerability, “the legal status of what you’re doing is very up in the air. Technically, you can still get sued by a project if you do white-hat work and steal some money to save it from a black-hat hacker,” said DarkFi.  The problem with the second option is the project isn’t incentivized to pay you the full amount once you have already told the project of the bug. Tong indicated that with funds already returned or vulnerabilities already patched, the project loses its incentive to pay the maximum amount it can and the white hat has less leverage.  In both scenarios, white-hat hackers typically want a reward because they saved a protocol from a greater loss. But at the same time, white hats don’t want to come off as extortionists – holding funds or information hostage unless they are “fairly” compensated.  The issue of vulnerability disclosure is “an optimization problem,” Tong said. “Because you want to minimize the pain"" for developers, users and hackers.  If the goal is to minimize as much pain for the developers and users, a project would just patch up the vulnerability and not give the hacker anything. And if the goal is to minimize the hacker’s pain, a project would pay the hacker, a pain point for those in charge.  Is it possible to have a fair outcome that makes everyone happy?  Tong says, “No … In most white-hat scenarios, there’s absolutely no win-win scenario.”  Money left on the table  DarkFi returned funds to Nomad in three transactions (one, two, three) before Stani Kulechov, the founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Aave, offered party tickets to white hats and before Nomad announced “an up to 10% bounty to Nomad Bridge hackers where Nomad will consider any party who returns at least 90% of the total funds they hacked to be a white hat.”  If a hacker looted $1 million, returned $900,000 and pocketed $100,000, Nomad would consider the hacker a white hat and not pursue legal action.  DarkFi hasn’t received a rAAVE ticket from Kulechov or a reward from Nomad yet.  Additionally, citing Arbitrum’s 400 ETH reward to 0xriptide after that hacker found a critical $400 million vulnerability, DarkFi noted that bounties aren’t high enough initially, saying projects tend to be stingy.  “It should be a very well-paying job to be a white hat,” he said.  “Making it more clear how we appreciate white hats in the space is very important so that in the future money doesn’t get left on the table for black hats,” DarkFi said.  Nomad didn’t return a request for comment by press time.  Sam Bankman-Fried’s 5-5 standard  Last month, Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX, put forth a new community standard for hackers involved in a security breach.  The “5-5 standard,” which values customer and user protection “above all,” prioritizes making customers whole again before rewarding an ethical hacker.  According to Bankman-Fried, the standard works only when the hacker is acting in good faith from the beginning. To be treated by the community as a ""good actor"" or a white hat, the hacker must return at least 95% of the stolen funds.  “If the 5-5 standard had been followed, historically, it would have reduced the impact of hacks by more than 98%,” Bankman-Fried said.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure  The number of times white-hat hackers have prevented a protocol from being exploited highlight concerns about how the Web3 ecosystem relies too much on them to catch critical vulnerabilities.  While white hats hold a significant duty in the security of the crypto ecosystem, “it’s absolutely not OK to rely on the white hats to keep you safe because that’s kind of the last line of defense,” Tong said. “That’s like the last saving grace that stops you from getting hacked because if you are getting ‘white-hatted,’ that already is not a great situation to be in.”  According to Tong, more thorough and stringent development practices need to be established in the long run because “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”  A white-hat bug disclosure is “an emergency with a silver lining. Your money was returned even though someone was hacking,” Tong said. “The takeaway is [that] the vulnerability should have been caught during development. It should have been caught during the audit.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | REGULATION | ZRX,Sage D.

42421994,jjC679rdH2yAqYFcxQCSeV,1667817813,Bernstein Says Polygon Blockchain Is the Web3 King,"The Polygon blockchain has emerged as the leading gateway for moving Web2 consumers to Web3, Bernstein said in a research report Friday. The system has been chosen by Starbucks (SBUX), NuBank, Reddit, DraftKings (DKNG), Robinhood Markets (HOOD) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms' (META) Instagram.  Polygon’s native cryptocurrency, MATIC, rallied 30% in two days last week after Meta said it would introduce a toolkit allowing Instagram users to mint and sell Polygon-powered non-fungible-tokens (NFTs).  The Polygon team has done two things right, the report from Bernstein said. It has hired talent from large global tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), YouTube and Airbnb (ABNB), and it has used its “business development muscle” to reach out to consumer-heavy brands.  “This has put Polygon in the unique position to be the Web3 on-ramp for millions of users,” and with the MATIC token trading at about $1.13, “the market has started rewarding it for building through the bear market,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  Web3 represents the next generation of the internet that promotes decentralized protocols and aims to reduce dependency on large tech companies.  Bernstein notes two criticisms that have been leveled against Polygon: That its current proof-of-stake chain isn't a long-term solution because it is actually a side chain and that “Polygon has been parasitic to Ethereum.”  The broker says Polygon has been smart, making strategic acquisitions during the bull market that ended last year. It acquired multiple teams who were building zero-knowledge layer 2 scaling products (zk-rollups) on the Ethereum blockchain, and during the current bear market, it has built a working live solution for zk-rollups, with an impending launch.  This allows Polygon to overcome a technological barrier and to build a long-term scaling platform that can support a Web2-like scale. Because it was built as an Ethereum VM (virtual machine)-compatible platform, it uses standard Ethereum language and tools and uses ether (ETH) as the gas currency across the platform, the note said.  Polygon moves from “potential cannibalization” of the Ethereum blockchain to becoming a complimentary scaling platform, bringing value back to the Ethereum ecosystem, the note said. Therefore, “Polygon’s success becomes the success of the Ethereum ecosystem.”  Zk-rollups are Ethereum layer 2 protocols that help process transactions separately from the main network to increase speed and lower costs. Layer 2 refers to separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. Layer 1 is the base layer or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain.

42422006,jjC679rdH2yAqYFcxQCSoZ,1667803382,Open Interest in FTT Futures Doubles as Binance Moves to Liquidate FTX Token Holdings,"Traders are scurrying to hedge against a potential slide in crypto exchange FTX's native token, FTT, in the wake of Binance's decision to liquidate FTT holdings and controversy surrounding Alameda's balance sheet.  Open interest, or the dollar amount dedicated to futures and perpetual futures tied to FTT, has more than doubled from $87.56 million to $203 million since early Asian hours, reaching a 12-month high, according to CoinGlass.  The funding rate, or the cost of holding bullish long positions or bearish short positions, has dropped sharply to an annualized -36%, per data provided by Matrixport Technologies. A negative funding rate implies shorts or bears have the upper hand and are willing to pay funding to longs to keep their positions open.  The combination of rising open interest and the negative funding rate suggests traders are taking short positions on FTT.  ""FTT’s funding rate has dropped to -36% annualized as opening interest has doubled. Many new shorts seem to have been put on,"" Markus Thielen, head of research at Strategy at Matrixport, said. ""Trading volumes in the FTT spot market has increased from $58 million to $3 billion.""  Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said, ""Last week, Alameda's balance sheet was questioned, and Binance also announced that it would liquidate FTT and other assets related to the FTX exchange. That appears to have caused a panic among investors, who chose to hedge their assets such as FTT.""  ""FTT holders have to stop losses by shorting perps,"" Ardern added. The token was down 4% on the day at $22 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.  On Sunday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that he will be liquidating the remaining FTT tokens acquired as a part of the exit from Alameda's sister company FTX last year.  ""Due to recent revelations that have come to light, we have decided to liquidate any remaining FTT on our books,"" Zhao tweeted, referring to CoinDesk's scoop about Alameda holding $3.66 billion worth of unlocked or illiquid FTT tokens on its balance sheet.  ""Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA,"" Zhao added.  Terra's LUNA token (now known as LUNC) crashed in May, destroying billions of dollars in investor wealth.  According to crypto exchange Phemex, Alameda owns over 50% of the FTT token, and a continued slide in the cryptocurrency's price could have market-wide ramifications.  ""As the price decreases, Alameda will be the only buyer. The main takeaway is despite a recent price spike in cryptocurrencies, if there’s another potential big-time player getting margin called, it could reignite fear that a LUNA-type situation could occur before the end of 2022,"" Phemex said in a daily market note.

42422002,jjC679rdH2yAqYFcxQCSlT,1667799000,"Ex-House Speaker, Former Justice Official Join US Policy Crew Assembled by Paradigm","Paul Ryan, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, will join past leaders of both parties’ congressional campaign committees in a group formed by Paradigm in a bid to help shape the crypto policies coming out of Washington, D.C., company officials said.  The crypto venture-capital firm has been amping up its presence in the U.S. capital this year. Paradigm officials said this new policy council is meant to provide internal guidance when the midterm elections overhaul the political landscape. Next year is expected to mark the most important U.S. legislative moment for crypto to date, with Congress poised to move on stablecoins and potentially cementing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in place as the dominant regulator of crypto trading.  “Crypto – Web3 – has the advantage right now of being pre-partisan,” said council member Parker Poling, a partner at Harbinger Strategies. Poling was the executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee and was chief of staff to Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who is widely expected to be chairman of the House Financial Services Committee next year. “People don't really have fully developed opinions and neural pathways about crypto.”  Poling told CoinDesk that crypto legislation could be on the “very short list of items” that could find traction during a session in which no single party is dominating Washington. She said she’s not necessarily an expert in digital assets but knows Congress and politics, so she can help bridge the divide on Capitol Hill, “where very few members really understand crypto very well.”  Ryan, on the ticket (as vice president) with Mitt Romney during the unsuccessful 2012 presidential campaign, will serve on the council with Steve Israel, a former Democratic congressman from New York who ran his party’s congressional campaign committee; Makan Delrahim, a former U.S. assistant attorney general for the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division; Chris Brummer, a Georgetown University professor who established DC Fintech Week; and current and former officials from the League of Conservation Voters, Electronic Frontier Foundation and National Bankers Association.  The group will meet at least once a month to hash out a game plan to influence future crypto policies in the U.S., said Justin Slaughter, Paradigm’s policy director. On Nov. 16, Paradigm is also hosting a hands-on crypto education session for policymakers in Washington, where Ryan is set to appear.  “Next year is likely to be the big year for crypto policymaking,"" Slaughter said. He said it was important to get an advisory group that had an especially wide range of experiences to prepare for that. “We wanted this council to reflect all the myriad things crypto touches.""  Other big crypto companies have made similar moves, including Binance, which announced a global policy group in September. Binance brought on Max Baucus, a former U.S. Senate Finance Committee chairman and ambassador to China, to lead a board of prominent former government officials, also including David Wright, a former secretary general of the International Organization of Securities Commissions.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/07/ex-house-speaker-former-justice-official-join-us-policy-crew-assembled-by-paradigm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73fc194dbac48884747eb4da4069ed8bc48a787d-3659x2757.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FTX’s FTT exchange token, which makes up a significant amount of Alameda's assets, is down 5% on day as Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao publicly feuded with Alameda’s CEO Caroline Ellison about selling off Binance’s FTT holdings.  Exchange balances of FTT are also surging, according to data provided by Glassnode. Typically, high exchange balances imply that there's a lot of liquidity for buying and selling tokens. This usually results in a downwards price trend as traders look to sell tokens.  Data from Nansen shows that FTX is suffering from a major spike in exchange outflows. During the last week approximately $292 million in stablecoins have left FTX. Traders could be departing the exchange over fears of liquidity issues, as Alameda is a large market maker on FTX.  Meanwhile, Solana, a token backed by Alameda and FTX, is down 11% on day. According to a copy of the Alameda balance sheet seen by CoinDesk, Alameda holds $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.”  Also caught in the market turmoil is Binance’s BNB token, which is down 4%.  Perhaps the fears of a full-blown liquidity crisis are overblown as market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) held steady. Bitcoin's implied volatility, or options traders' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period, continue to trend sideways, indicating little signs of panic.  The current CoinDesk Market Index is at 1,041.

42421999,jjC679rdH2yAqYFcxQCSj9,1667782057,First Mover Asia: FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried Talks Consumer Protection and Crypto Titans Clash,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: A posturing battle breaks out between crypto titans over the FTX exchange's FTT token, while Solana's SOL token suffers from a post-conference hangover. Crypto traders are looking ahead to this week's midterm elections in the U.S. and a key inflation report.  Insights: Speaking the same language as regulators is a ticket to making digital assets mainstream, an opportunity worth trillions.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  By Bradley Keoun  The weekend brought no shortage of crypto-markets drama, but it wasn't about bitcoin: Intense speculation appeared to drive steep losses on the FTX exchange's FTT token and Solana's SOL.  The FTX token, which pushed into headlines (and Twitter chatter) last week after CoinDesk reported just how significant of an asset it was on the trading firm Alameda Research's balance sheet, came under additional pressure after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that the firm would sell its remaining holdings of FTT, a stake worth more than $500 million. The FTT price rebounded after the CEO of Alameda, which like FTX is a part of billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's empire, tweeted that it would happily buy FTT at $22 each. But by late Sunday FTT had reversed course and was falling again, around $22.24, down 7.6% over the past 24 hours.  Solana's SOL spiked as Google Cloud announced plans to become a validator on the blockchain network, but by press time it, too, had turned lower and was one of the day's biggest losers among the 162 assets in the CoinDesk Market Index, down 11% over 24 hours. The token had gained in the weeks leading up to Solana's Breakpoint conference currently taking place in Lisbon, Portugal, concluding Monday. These blockchain conferences often bring a slew of announcements that tend to rile up investors, developers and fans, but it's not uncommon for the enthusiasm to fade quickly.  Dogecoin (DOGE), which more than doubled in October to become the top performer in the CMI, is now licking its wounds; the meme token frequently mentioned by billionaire Elon Musk (Twitter's new owner) is down 19% so far this month.  Bitcoin (BTC), for what it's worth, was trading around $21,000 after hitting a fresh seven-week high on Saturday. The largest cryptocurrency's recent gains has pushed it over key levels on price charts, potentially signaling a crucial shift toward a more bullish trend.  Equity markets finished last week on a moderate upswing as the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed Friday up more than a percentage point – in sync with a 4.7% gain that day for bitcoin. Safe haven gold swung upward 3%, a rare exception to its recent form. Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of energy markets, climbed near $99 per barrel, a 5% increase from the start of the week.  In the coming week, crypto traders will be focused on Tuesday's midterm elections in the U.S., which might have major implications for regulatory policy or economic decisions. Then, on Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department is due to report the latest reading of the Consumer Price Index, expected to show that the main inflation rate staying at 8% or higher in October – still not too far from a four-decade high, and indicating just how much work the Federal Reserve has to do to cool off the economy and bring the figure back down.  ""The midterms and inflation data will no doubt keep market participants busy,"" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a report.  Insight  By Sam Reynolds  JPMorgan’s Umar Farooq, its blockchain unit boss, said something in very plain language about the future of institutional involvement in crypto during the Singapore Fintech Festival: ""We cannot lose their money.""  Farooq was referring to exactly what it would take for banks to get involved in digital assets. Consumer protection, alongside the ability to identify both parties in the transaction, is key to building a digital assets sector that can be integrated into the world’s banking system and with its trillions in assets.  Think about what happens if you send crypto to the wrong wallet. It’s gone, as Coinbase puts it bluntly on a help page.  “Due to the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency protocols, transactions can't be canceled or reversed once initiated,” the exchange writes. “Because of this, it is essential to exercise caution when sending and make sure the address you are sending to is an exact match of the recipient's address.”  Chainanalysis estimates that around 20% of all bitcoin has been lost in this fashion, and is unrecoverable. Anecdotes of eight-figure amounts effectively evaporating because they were sent to the wrong wallet abound.  This certainly happens in the traditional finance world as well.  But in TradFi there are ways to reverse these transactions. SWIFT has a built-in recall mechanism, which has saved victims of various forms of wire fraud collectively hundreds of millions of dollars. In the United States, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) acts as a watchdog over the remittance industry and provides consumer protections, such as the right to cancel a money transfer and the right to resolve mistakes. These mechanisms don’t exist in crypto.  As a technicality, one could say parts of crypto have this but only when the wallets are KYC’ed, or follow Know Your Customer rules. For example, Crypto.com sued a woman in Melbourne who was mistakenly refunded $10 million.  SBF weighs in  FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried caught some flak from the libertarian wing of big crypto by suggesting in a policy white paper that there’s a necessity for KYC and respecting the Treasury Department’s sanction wing, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  “Maintaining a blocklist is a good balance: prohibiting illegal transfers and freezing funds associated with financial crimes while otherwise allowing commerce,” SBF wrote. “To be clear, this does not mean that passports and social security numbers are necessary to buy a bagel from 7-11 – but issuances and redemptions of stablecoins should be [Bank Secrecy Act]-level KYC'ed activity.”  SBF sees this as a necessity to integrate crypto into the pools of liquidity worth trillions of dollars in the TradFi market.  Erik Voorhees dismissed this all as tyranny and appeared to have the support of many people behind him.  But dismissing this as tyranny is going to be a nonstarter for people like JPMorgan’s Farooq.  “I can’t foresee people being able to send money across borders if no one checks and no one knows who’s sending money to who, because sooner or later they will be in a money-laundering incident,” he’s quoted as saying. “Those are the very fundamental things that need to be addressed before you even get to systematic issues.”  While a certain degree of sympathy has to be extended to the libertarians because of how laggardly and geriatric regulators have historically been, dismissing the need for some oversight of crypto by calling it “tyranny” invites the industry to establish more regulatory controls.  Yes, rules about securities that stem from court cases that occurred in the 1940s need to be updated. But there have to be rules.  By not speaking the same language as regulators, it’s a ticket to missing out on an opportunity worth trillions of dollars. Farooq and SBF both want to make digital assets mainstream, and know what needs to happen. It's people like Erik Voorhees who are holding things back.
