Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, 45, communicated with his victims, encouraging them to invest in various fictitious schemes, according to an announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice Thursday.  Karlsson directed his victims to make their investments using cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and has admitted to defrauding no fewer than 3,575 victims of more than $16 million between November 2012 and June 2019.  Operating under several aliases, Karlsson used the website of his company, Eastern Metal Securities, to advertise investment in a ""Pre Funded Reversed Pension Plan"" at $98 per share where investors would receive payout of 1.15 kilograms of gold per share.  Karlsson's arrest in Thailand in June 2019 was followed by his extradition to the United States and his indictment the following month.

Declining 4.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $47,578-$51,781 (CoinDesk 20)    Bitcoin's price fell by the most in a week after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged he ""would be concerned"" by tightening financial conditions because rising U.S. government-bond yields put upward pressure on borrowing costs.      The comments might signal more hesitation in providing fresh monetary stimulus. Bitcoin prices quadrupled last year and have rallied 66% this year on speculation the cryptocurrency could serve as an inflation hedge in the face of trillions of dollars of money printing by central banks around the world.      As of press time, bitcoin was changing hands around $48,204, down about 4.5% over the past 24 hours.      Powell said in a question-and-answer session with the Wall Street Journal he doesn't expect higher inflation to persist and that the central bank is still ""a long way from our goals"" of an economic recovery and lower unemployment.      The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed on Thursday above 1.5% as disappointment spread among some traders in traditional markets who had bet the Fed might provide specifics on how to tamp down long-term interest rates, according to Bloomberg News.      For bitcoin traders who have been betting the cryptocurrency's price is a good hedge against potential currency debasement, Powell's comments offered few signs the Fed plans new dovish actions. Such moves might include expanding the U.S. central bank's $120 billion-a-month bond-purchasing program.      ""Powell did not deliver,"" the cryptocurrency trader Alex Kruger tweeted. ""Basically repeated his usual dovish lines.""      Stocks were lower on Thursday, also potentially reflecting dimmed expectations of more stimulus that might boost the equities market.    Ether falls with bitcoin    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell by 2.5% to $1,528.

Some Nvidia investors alleged the graphics processing unit company's statements were false or misleading regarding how much revenue growth was due to sales related to cryptocurrency mining.  The three-year-old lawsuit claimed Nvidia misrepresented $1 billion in revenue from sales to cryptocurrency miners.  But the federal district court ruled insufficient proof was offered to show the company misled investors. According to court documents, the court said the ""allegations do not plausibly suggest that Defendants acted with at least deliberate or conscious recklessness.""  The court dismissed the case given the insufficient proof even after investors were previously given opportunity to add additional evidence of misleading or false statements.

42433820,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5T1h,1614890106,Dapps Don't Care About Your Feelings,"Sticks and stones may break my bones, blockchains will never hurt me.      As CoinDesk’s David Pan reported Wednesday, anonymous blockchain developers recently built decentralized apps (dapps) with inflammatory themes on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Their apparent goal was to taunt Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), and see if he’d try to censor the apps (and perhaps make a broader political statement).      One of the two dapps is called Tanks of Tiananmen, a reference to the 1989 protests in Beijing which, as David diplomatically puts it, “the Chinese government considers a very sensitive topic.”      The developers described the app as a sort of twisted game in which the user plays the role of the Communist Party and faces off against “the pro democracy movement lead [sic] by the great CZ,” presumably a non-player character.      For American readers, it’s as if someone created a role-playing game called Rifles of Kent State, and cast Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong as the hippie girl with the flower. Or if that reference is too old to sting, picture Hoods of Abu Ghraib, Waterboards of Guantanamo, Drones of Yemen, or – trigger warning, grab your puppies – Op-Eds of Cotton. I’ll stop before some degen out there gets some smart ideas.    Marc Hochstein is CoinDesk's executive editor. The views expressed are his own, so please don't blame his colleagues. This article is excerpted from The Node (formerly Blockchain Bites), CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The difference, of course, is the United States has a robust if imperfect tradition of free speech, constitutionally and culturally. Washington may try to regulate cryptocurrency to discourage money laundering or fraud, but it’s hard to imagine the government trying to squelch even the most tasteless reminders of dark chapters in our nation’s history. (At least until there are millennials on the U.S. Supreme Court, Lord help us.)      The same cannot be said today for the People’s Republic of China. While Binance’s headquarters location remains a perennial mystery, the Tank devs seem to think the PRC has sufficient leverage over CZ that he would remove the app to avoid its wrath.    Nasty stuff    The other dapp testing the limits of what’s permissible on BSC is called Slave. At first, I thought this was a reference to the detention facilities in China where reportedly more than 1 million Uighurs are being held, which would have put the app in the same topical-if-crude bucket as Tanks.      Then I saw a screenshot of a deleted web page for the app, which I will not reproduce here. You will have to take my word for it that the imagery was appalling, and unrelated in any discernible way to Chinese politics, though after Voltaire, I would defend to the death the devs’ right to publish it. Just not on CoinDesk.      But Enlightenment values, which may not be long for this world, are not what make blockchains censorship-resistant.      From the article:      The developers apparently hope the offensive and sensitive nature of the dapps would force Binance to get rid of them, proving BSC, unlike Ethereum, is not decentralized and can be controlled by a centralized institution, said Jason Wu, CEO and founder of decentralized crypto lending platform DeFiner. He noted that BSC has far fewer nodes than Ethereum.      As of press time, Tanks and Slave were still running on BSC. If the network is a worthy competitor to Ethereum, CZ couldn’t remove the dapps if he wanted to.      And that, of course, is the anonymous devs’ point. A dapp that can be censored ain’t a dapp.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/04/dapps-dont-care-about-your-feelings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb8a7b0462a5b608d12df36d373f62266cafabc7-1200x811.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

To patch the bug and re-start the Kava chain, the development team are asking validators to revert to an earlier version of the software, Kava-4, before updating to the new Kava-6 version in roughly 12 hours, according to Messari.  Kava 5, the software version containing the bug, was released this week, shortly before the bug was discovered.  The platform's safety committee shut down the Kava-5 chain at block 459. Kava Labs is planning to replay the state and determine the source of the error.  “User funds are not affected. A fix is currently being worked on. Will update shortly,” a Kava Labs tweet reads.  According to Messari, the ""high severity bug"" was paying out liquidity providers on the platform ""well above expected values.""  These specific payouts are timelocked, the post explains, so they could not be sent to exchanges, just claimed by their users.  ""Kava Labs' monitoring suite picked up the bug within minutes of Kava 5 launch, way before any HARD claims could actually be distributed – this was by design,"" said Scott Stuart, co-founder of Kava Labs, in a statement shared with CoinDesk.  Kava is a blockchain built on the Tendermint consensus algorithm and is also a participant in the Cosmos blockchain interoperability project.  Kava's HARD protocol is its cross-chain money market that allows users to lend, borrow, and earn with a variety of digital assets.  The Binance-backed chain went live last year and offers yield farming applications similar to those found in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

42433812,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5Sph,1614882416,"DOGE Adoption on the Rise. Dallas Mavericks to Accept Dogecoin for Tickets, Merchandise","Dogecoin (DOGE), the Shiba Inu-represented cryptocurrency, is heading to the National Basketball Association.    The Dallas Mavericks will soon be accepting the meme-based cryptocurrency as part of an agreement with crypto payment services provider BitPay, which is rolling out the coin as a payment option for merchants and consumers.  It's the second big piece of news for the canine cryptocurrency this week. On Tuesday, ATM provider CoinFlip announced DOGE can now be purchased with cash across its 1,800-machine network.  And while one would be forgiven for thinking the deal might not be as big a deal for the Mavericks, which began accepting bitcoin as a method of payment for almost two years, you wouldn't know it from the tone of the announcement:  “The Mavericks have decided to accept dogecoin as payment for Mavs tickets and merchandise for one very important, earth-shattering reason: Because we can!"" Mark Cuban, the team's billionaire owner, barked in the press release.  It's not Cuban's first DOGE show, either. Early last month, Cuban tweeted he'd bought some DOGE in order for his son to teach him about the crypto markets.  ""For those of you who would like to learn more about dogecoin we strongly encourage you to talk to your teenagers who are on TikTok and ask them about it. They will be able to explain it all to you,"" Cuban said.  That BitPay, the largest provider of crypto payment services in the world, is now offering it as a form of payment continues the remarkable resurgence of DOGE, which had basically played dead for all of 2020, trading at times for less than half a cent.  In just a few short months, the meme-based crypto has gone from mutt to best in show.  The interest in the cryptocurrency began when people ranging from Tesla CEO Elon Musk to Snoop Dogg adopted DOGE as a pet cause.  Soon the coin captured the imagination of the crypto-buying public and occasionally has surpassed vastly larger bitcoin as the most mentioned cryptocurrency on Twitter.  Year to date, DOGE has risen about 1,000%, trading about five cents at press time and now has a market cap of more than $6 billion. Earlier in the year, it was above $10 billion.  Overall, it's been quite the tale and judging by the day's BitPay news, DOGE still may have a ways to run.  Read more: A Better Breed of DOGE?

42411652,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glRQOu,1614881935,"NFTs, DAOs and the New Creator Economy","Media companies are talent companies. As that becomes increasingly obvious to the media industry at large, there has been an acceleration of development by both challengers and incumbents to position themselves to capture media's most critical natural resource: people.      The creator economy served as a catalyst to disrupt legacy structures by introducing platforms and products that enable individuals to build a business around themselves. Top talent wants more control and ownership over their work, having options to transcend their reputation and financial success from a parent brand.    Jarrod Dicker is a media executive and investor. Brian Flynn is cofounder of Rabbithole. Patrick Rivera is an engineer at Mirror.    Independence is really hard. The creator economy has invited criticism of creator burnout, lack of necessary support and an absence of strategic and educational resources for individuals to better guide themselves in isolation. While there is accelerated development in the creator economy to fulfill those needs, there’s another economy being built that is positioned to extend the promise of the new media structure even further.      The ownership economy – by way of decentralized autonomous organizations (aka DAO) and non-fungible tokens (aka NFT) – builds a business on top of the creator economy that encourages creators, operators and the community to collaborate together under a new, interdependent ownership mechanism that combines the best of both (legacy and creator economy) worlds and then some.    This new media structure will be wholly owned by the creators, operators and consumers themselves.    This new media structure will be wholly owned by the creators, operators and consumers themselves. It will be a product of both the public and its producers and will not limit participants to a single company. These media companies can be looked at as collectives, with their own identities, where creators and consumers are encouraged to flow interdependently throughout various collectives. All of which results in everyone investing in both the development of each collective and sharing in the value of the collective’s upside.    TV, for example    To think of this pragmatically, let’s look at TV shows. Actors, actresses, producers and writers are free agents and sign deals for specific series on many platforms. Each series builds its own identity, reputation and community. The individuals who contribute to the show are free to work on other projects and may even be encouraged to in order to increase their own and the show's reputation (marketing!). This interoperability makes everything the individual touches more valuable.      Back to creator-DAOs and NFTs. A DAO allows its creators, its support, its contributors and its audience to be owners in the collective. It means that every operation, and participants in the operation, are now shareholders. Today, creators can be owners in a media company by way of equity, but that’s often limited by the role each individual plays. As a result, once talented individuals build a strong enough reputation they're incentivized to negotiate contracts or go independent to retain more ownership over their work.      See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?      Media companies are starting to think about how they build a more welcome environment for those creators, but they’re developing in parallel to challenger structures like creator DAOs. DAOs present an alternative organizational structure that tries to align incentives for the long-term among a variety of stakeholders. The relationship changes from creator and consumer to everyone as co-creators. Creative organizations begin to look more like flat peer-to-peer networks as opposed to hierarchies.      This is possible because the media company (collective) itself is a crowdfund of its creators, supporters and community members. All participators invest in the entity, which results in a token, the “equity” of DAOs. All revenue across advertising, subscriptions, events and other means is then pooled to a treasury where all cash inflows and outflows are recorded publicly. There is a universal share in the ownership.      Where NFTs come in is that all digital assets created by the DAO are minted as NFTs. Through that, every asset becomes managed, monitored and owned. This means creators, operators and participants are all collaborators on the NFT asset. Outside of pure ownership and participation, this means an asset returns royalties based on the performance of the content, delivering returns for participants in perpetuity.      See also: Joon Ian Wong - A New Era of Media Begins With Tokenization      As media moved from print to digital, creative assets lost the ability to control and maintain value throughout the web ecosystem. With NFTs, digital media now becomes a liquid financial asset secured through cryptography, and programmable through smart contracts.      NFT creators in the future will have two paths: independent or collective. As independent actors, creators can realize the full upside of their NFT creations and earn built-in royalties. But the collective model is an entirely new way to build distribution. Because the NFTs are programmable, the royalties can be broken down further into fractional shares.      Another benefit of NFTs is they turn digital media into public goods with pseudonymous ownership. A digital media file that’s minted as an NFT can be read by everyone, but owned as a collectible by a single entity. This provides a new monetization channel for digital media without limiting growth by putting content behind a paywall. It also revitalizes business models that used to be lucrative in the print era but lost in the digital era like the wire service.      See also: What Is a DAO?      There are parallel efforts throughout the media and tech ecosystem to try and get to the same place. How do we evolve the media’s infrastructure to draw benefit for the talent, the support and the community?  To capitalize on providing an infrastructure that benefits all parties, the foundation needs to be broken down and built back up again. It’s very hard to renovate a business, especially one that hasn’t been built on the criteria for the new era.      The creator economy started tearing down the foundation of legacy media’s structure to encourage both existing media companies and new entrants to think about building for and enabling talent-based companies. As both businesses begin to map out the next iteration of their technical and business architecture, there is infrastructure being mapped out that is ripe for all economies to be built on top of – the ownership economy.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,"Jarrod Dicker, Brian Flynn, Patrick Rivera",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/04/nfts-daos-and-the-new-creator-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7520028d2c7fd3c78582eb6faec906be377e83f-2014x1464.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433809,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5Slh,1614875090,Why CBDCs Are Really Game-Changing,"There are a number of countries around the world that are in the process of deploying or testing tokenized national currencies, in both blockchain technology systems and other formats. These initiatives are often talked about in the context of digitizing the money supply, but this is misleading. More than 90% of all money is already digital, with only about 10% of the money in most industrial countries taking the form of physical cash.      Not only is most money already digital, but most payments are as well – processed by bank transfers, credit cards, debit cards and other services. Indeed, central banks are making enormous investments in further accelerating and streamlining the digital payment process, an endeavor that is entirely independent of approaches to tokenization or blockchains.    Paul Brody is EY's global innovation leader for blockchain and a CoinDesk columnist.    In the U.S., the Federal Reserve will shortly be releasing a new solution – FedNow – that will support near real-time digital payments nationally. In doing so, the Fed will join a number of other countries that have also built and deployed similar infrastructure, including the U.K., Australia, Mexico and Nigeria.      So, if most money and payments are already digital and many governments are investing in even faster real-time payments systems, then what is the value of blockchain-style tokenization?      The answer is programmability. Payment systems today operate independently from the business agreements that drive those payments. This makes things much more complex and far less reliable than they seem when you keep a narrow focus on the payment alone.      See also: Paul Brody - Public Blockchains Are Set to Reshape Global Commerce (2020 Was the Start)      When you walk into a store and walk out with a soda, you have entered into an agreement to exchange money for a product. While the payment may be digital, the agreement isn’t. In a retail setting, there is no written agreement as such. In a business environment, the agreements are almost always written and explicit about the exchange of money for products and services.      With tokenized financial instruments, we can directly link the transfer of financial assets to the performance of specific work, or the creation of a specific asset. This makes reconciling payments between parties automatic because there is a fully integrated digital trail between the agreement, the creation of the asset that would be represented by a digital token, and the payment for that asset or service as represented by the transfer of tokenized money.      Not only would this hugely simplify the execution of business agreements, it would also allow for a much better understanding of risk in the economy. Smart contracts that link financial assets with complex behaviors, like derivatives with tokenized money, would allow regulators to see just how much money was tied up in these contracts, and even simulate what would happen in the event of significant price changes.    Because programmability represents both the single biggest source of value and the largest source of risk for central banks, its introduction is likely to be very gradual.    Since most payments are made by consumers and are not executed as part of a contracted agreement (like a mortgage or car loan), it seems that tokenized, programmable fiat currencies will not add significant value to the consumer economy in those cases. One clear exception is the countries where there is very little competition between payment systems, so having a nationally underwritten digital currency system accessible to all banks and retailers could spur significant cost reductions through an increase in competition. The line between more competition and central banks competing with the private sector will also have to be managed carefully.      In the case of business-to-business transactions, the value proposition for tokenized fiat currencies would appear to be much larger in both financial and industrial settings. However, to make that work, central banks will have to allow for a high level of programmability, something that they may not be comfortable with – at least not early on.      The early history of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Ethereum should serve as a reminder that the early days of any programmable system are often an era of extensive real-world security testing. That’s a polite way of saying there are lots of security flaws to be uncovered and ruthlessly exploited. In the context of a $15 trillion economy, for example, all the ups and downs in Ethereum DeFi amount to a low-cost experiment.      Because programmability represents both the single biggest source of value and the largest source of risk for central banks, its introduction is likely to be very gradual. One option is to deploy the currency first and then add programmability.      See also: EY’s Paul Brody Expects Consumer DeFi Ignition in 2021      A second option is to allow experimentation on public blockchains and then to create a regulatory framework that allows banks and other parties to issue tokens on public chains that are backed by insured bank deposits. Both such experiments are underway and it will be a few years before the results can be fully assessed.      With more than $100 billion now locked in DeFi on Ethereum, we can at least draw some early conclusions from one of these experiments: tech-savvy consumers are not deterred by hacking events and are willing to bear some of the costs of proving the technology.  If DeFi providers can implement privacy systems, then we may also get a look at how much programmability enterprise users are interested in, and what kinds of precautions will be needed to get them on board. For the risk averse, this is a good time to grab some popcorn and pull up a seat, as the show has already started.

The exchange’s users can now deposit and withdraw bitcoin using the Lightning Network, a network which operates independently from Bitcoin’s mainnet to facilitate instant, low-fee transactions.    Read more: A Guide to Saving on Bitcoin’s High Transaction Fees    OKCoin announced its plans to integrate the scaling solution at the end of January, citing a need to offer users a lower cost option for moving bitcoin in the face of rising on-chain fees.      “From the business side of things, we’ll be focusing on working with different partners in the space to bring Lightning Network utility to our customers,” Hong Fang, CEO of OKCoin, told CoinDesk, adding that the next step is to open up enough channels with other well-connect Lightning service providers to amp up the exchange’s Lightning liquidity.    OKCoin’s Bitcoin developer grant    Fang told CoinDesk the developer grant to Antoine Riard is “very much in line with what we’ve been doing with previous grants.”      Riard is a prolific Lightning developer whose current work focuses on security and designing Lightning developer tools. The undisclosed sum is intended to support his work for 12 months.      OKCoin chose to sponsor Riard’s work because it believes the Lightning Network’s security still requires some tender loving care, something on which he is focusing. Riard told CoinDesk he will work on fixes to vulnerabilities that affect payment channel closes and other attack vectors, as well as conducting new research on Lightning Network fault tolerance and fine tuning his Lightning development software kit.      “We wanted to sponsor a lightning network, on one hand because we are supporting the network, but on the other because Lightning is advanced but it still needs a lot of development. Security questions have been raised and Antoine is one of the developers who is working on this full time,” Fang told CoinDesk.      For later grants, Fang told CoinDesk the exchange will likely look outside technical development and put money into research and new user onboarding.      The proliferation of Bitcoin-related grants has risen in step with bitcoin’s bull market, and more of the donors behind these grants have turned attention to research and education rather than than solely to technical development.

Crypto asset insurance of one sort of another is a fast-growing space, with major insurance broker Aon announcing a pilot this week that looks at risks associated with the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      Launched in January 2021, Unslashed designs decentralized insurance products that players in the crypto industry can purchase to cover the various risks they might encounter. That could be a DeFi lending platform going bankrupt, for example, or cover against the penalties incurred if a set of nodes has unexpected downtime. It might also include more esoteric risks like stablecoins losing their peg, smart-contract oracle failures and so on.    Read more: Insurance Giant Aon Is Testing the Waters of DeFi    Similar to some other decentralized insurance products, crypto holders or investors are invited to underwrite the risk by depositing capital and earning premiums. Currently, those investors can earn between 4% and 5% yield on the crypto they deposit with Unslashed.    Policy mix    The startup’s first product, called the Spartan Bucket, comprises a diversified mix of crypto risks and therefore qualifies as “low risk,” according to Unslashed founder Marouane Hajji. The first bucket currently contains seven policies but will eventually house 24, at which time the yield will be between 15% and 20%, Hajji said.      “We're taking a lot of different policies, representing a lot of different risks that have low correlation or that are uncorrelated,” said Hajji. “A smart contract hack of Compound, for example, and the slashing event of Lido; those two risks are really uncorrelated.”    Read more: Ethereum-Based Nexus Mutual Expands Its Decentralized ‘Insurance’ to Centralized Exchanges    British Virgin Islands-based Unslashed’s insurance offering is entirely unregulated, like the blockchain platforms it covers. The policy guidelines are clearly set out, said Hajji, and there is a maximum amount of exposure that the capital suppliers can have for one policy.      As it stands, Unslashed says it has sold over $400 million worth of cover and collected $90 million in capital deposits. The firm is yet to make any payouts. Hajji explained it does use a decentralized “court,” in the form of Kleros, an Ethereum-based dispute resolution system.      In addition to selling staking cover to hosting service Lido, Unslashed says it has provided cover to crypto hedge funds such as Techemy Capital, to cover risks relating to DeFi stalwarts like Uniswap, Compound, ParaSwap and Kyber.      “This first structured insurance product is low risk and we are expected to pay out once every two or three years with this one,” Hajji said. “But we are going to have another one that is going to be way more risky.

McGlone wrote in a March outlook report that a recent drop below zero in the so-called Grayscale premium – a closely watched metric in cryptocurrency markets – could signal that last week's swift 21% sell-off to about $43,000 might have reset the market for a fresh run. As of Thursday, prices had rebounded to about $50,000.      The Grayscale premium refers to the difference between price of bitcoin as implied by cost of shares in the publicly traded Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), and the price of bitcoin as traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. Historically, it's been positive. For a story on the Grayscale premium flipping negative, go here. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)    ""Bitcoin's end-of-February price disparities on U.S. regulated exchanges portend a firming price foundation, if history is a guide,"" McGlone wrote.  ""Indicating capitulation selling, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust closed at its steepest discount ever, while December CME-traded bitcoin futures settled about 20% higher.  ""Normal maturation and increasing market depth will narrow wide price disparities, and we view the end-of-February extremes as an indication of just how nascent bitcoin still is.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/04/grayscale-discount-might-signal-start-of-fresh-bitcoin-rally-bloombergs-mcglone-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11971c9f4e56d1703d9874b660c1dc2763c0737e-1063x689.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433817,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5Sxh,1614868411,BitGo Receives NYDFS Approval for New York Trust Charter,"Digital asset financial services firm BitGo is coming to New York.      After receiving approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for a New York trust charter, BitGo plans to hold crypto funds in the state and offer custody as a service to large New York-based financial institutions, said Pete Najarian, chief revenue officer at BitGo. BitGo announced it had applied for the New York trust charter in August.      “We’re finding that the largest traditional financial institutions are all doing a considerable amount of work to determine what their level of participation will be in the digital asset space,” Najarian said. “For BitGo that can mean collaborative relationships in which we act as a sub-custodian or we work in partnership or we develop white label solutions.”      It's a situation not unlike the similarly chartered Paxos, which has been the backend provider for PayPal's crypto service since late last year. (BitGo reportedly rebuffed an offer of as much as $750 million to be acquired by PayPal, according to unnamed sources.)      Najarian also espoused a view in an interview with CoinDesk last year that banks should turn to crypto custodians to act as sub-custodians for digital assets instead of doing it themselves.      Najarian did not comment on whether the New York trust charter was a step towards BitGo pursuing a national trust bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as Anchorage did last year.      “We are constantly evaluating the right long-term path here,” Najarian said. “I would expect that over time it will make sense for ourselves and firms like us to continue to evaluate what’s the most seamless path to get to a regulatory designation that allows you to custody assets with every state in the U.S. without ambiguity.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/04/bitgo-receives-nydfs-approval-for-new-york-trust-charter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a301291419eb5e3b030f53a120c45f984355352a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The investment banking giant's comments could offer relief to bitcoin bulls, some of whom argue that trillions of dollars in money printing by central banks raises the chances of inflation, bolstering the cryptocurrency's use as an investment hedge.      ""The earliest the Fed will start talking about tapering [of bond purchases] is late 2021, with any discussion of interest rate hikes only coming a year after that,"" Goldman Sachs' Andrew Tilton told CNBC.      The market for futures contracts used to bet on Federal Reserve funds now implies the first interest-rate hike could come as soon as 2022, versus the 2024 liftoff implied about four weeks ago. What's more, the futures are now pricing multiple rate hikes in 2023.      ""That feels aggressive to us,"" Tilton said, adding that the Fed hasn't even begun tapering its ongoing $120 billion-a-month in bond purchases, a supplemental form of monetary easing once interest rates are cut close to zero, as they were early last year when the coronavirus pandemic hit.      The Fed said earlier this year it's committed to continue buying $120 billion worth of bonds per month until it sees ""substantial further progress"" in the recovery. The bank has also reiterated that interest rates would remain at record lows for some time after inflation rises above the central bank's 2% target.      A tapering or rate hike could dilute bitcoin's appeal as an inflation hedge, inviting some selling pressure from momentum funds that bought the cryptocurrency as a store-of-value asset.

42433803,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5MZh,1614857303,Bitcoin Stays Below $50K as Traders Await Fed's Take on Bond Yields,"Bitcoin's recovery appears to have stalled as caution sets in ahead of expected comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell later on Thursday.      The cryptocurrency is currently nursing losses below $50,000, having bounced from $43,000 to $52,500 in the past four trading days, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      A Q&A between Powell and the Wall Street Journal today will be closely watched by investors as it may influence risk sentiment in the financial markets and set the tone for the next big move in bitcoin. Specifically, what Powell says about bond yields will be of interest, trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk.      According to ING analysts, ""Comments that [Powell] is monitoring events in the Treasury market might be enough to calm things down, encourage a return to a softer dollar.""      That could bode well for bitcoin and stocks. Both assets have mostly moved in the opposite direction to the dollar index over the past 12 months, as seen below.      However, the rally in yields may accelerate, leading to a stronger dollar and weaker bitcoin, if Powell downplays concerns over rising bond yields, taking cues from his European Central Bank counterparts.      ""No such concern [from Powell] would suggest the Fed is happy for Treasury yields to ‘find the right level’ – as our bond strategy colleagues say – potentially triggering another spike in yields and more dollar short-covering,"" ING analysts noted.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $49,010 – down 5% over 24 hours. The 10-year U.S. yield is seen at 1.46%, and the dollar index is hovering above 91, representing a 0.2% gain on the day.      The 10-year yield surged to 12-month highs above 1.6% last week, as traders priced in prospects of an early unwinding of stimulus by the Fed. As such, both stocks and bitcoin faced selling pressure, with the latter falling 20%, the biggest single-week decline in nearly 12 months. Both asset types have benefitted from the Fed's massive stimulus delivered since the March 2020 crash.      According to Citi analysts, markets are now pricing in an 80% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate hike to 0.25% by December 2022. Until a few weeks ago, the first interest rate hike was expected to happen in 2024.    Dollar rallies    The Dollar Index has already broken out of a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart, indicating the end of a year-long bearish trend and a reversal higher.      A rising dollar is one of the bigger headwinds for bitcoin's bullish trend, Kruger said.

42433797,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5MNh,1614850081,Ripple's Chris Larsen Files Motion to Dismiss SEC Case Over XRP Sales,"Ripple's executive chairman has asked a U.S. court to dismiss a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit alleging securities violations relating to sales of the XRP cryptocurrency.      According to a legal letter informing Judge Analisa Torres at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York of a motion to dismiss, lawyers say the SEC's amended complaint ""still fails to state a claim against Mr. Larsen.""      In December, the SEC sued Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Larsen alleging they had not registered XRP as a security or sought an exemption, and had sold over $1.3 billion in the cryptocurrency to retail investors.      The central claim centers on Larsen having ""knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to another person in violation of [Section 5]” of the Securities Act 1933, according to the amended complaint filed last month.      See also: Ripple, SEC Say Settlement Unlikely Before Trial Over Alleged Securities Violations      On those grounds, Larsen's lawyers contend the SEC failed to show that Larsen knew at the time XRP units were securities and Ripple's activities were inappropriate. They make various points to back this up, including that the Justice Department and FinCEN considered and regulated XRP as a ""virtual currency"" – a fact inconsistent with it being a security.      ""The SEC’s own allegations are not only deficient but affirmatively show it cannot meet this standard,"" the letter reads. ""At a minimum, the SEC must allege that it was 'so obvious' that XRP transactions were securities and Ripple’s conduct was improper that Mr. Larsen 'must have been aware of it.'""      The lawyers also argue the regulator fails to demonstrate Larsen had provided ""substantial assistance"" to Ripple in carrying out its sales of XRP, or that Larsen's XRP transactions were within the U.S. and hence within its jurisdiction.      ""This deficiency is fatal to the Section 5 claim against Mr. Larsen,"" according to the letter. ""To plead a Section 5 violation, the SEC must adequately allege that each sale occurred within the territorial reach of Section 5.""      See also: MoneyGram Faces Lawsuit for Allegedly Misleading Investors About XRP      The letter also alleges the SEC's claim for monetary relief is time-barred, having gone beyond the allotted period to pursue a claim under Section 5.      ""Because the SEC has alleged that the sales of XRP over a multi-year period constituted only one offer ... the statute of limitations began to run in 2013 and expired in 2018,"" the letter reads.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | XRP,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/04/ripples-chris-larsen-files-motion-to-dismiss-sec-case-over-xrp-sales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2bea7bb70e70ab50a5408b790027426525a79d20-1500x1018.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
