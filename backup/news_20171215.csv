42380151,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MEzD,1513372546,"Class-Action Suit Targets ICO Promoted By Floyd Mayweather, Jr.","An initial coin offering (ICO) promoted by boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., is at the center of a newly filed class-action complaint.  Dated Dec. 13, the lawsuit names Sohrab Sharma, Raymond Trapani, Robert Farkas and William Hagner, as well as Centra Tech, Inc., as defendants, accusing them of violating U.S. securities law through a token sale that ultimately raised $30 million for the development of a cryptocurrency-focused debit card.  The filing comes more than a month after two of the firm's founders left the startup. According to an Oct. 31 blog post from Centra, both Sharm and Trapani exited the project following the sale's completion, as well as a profile of them and the ICO by The New York Times.  In the complaint, lawyers for the plaintiff alleged that the Centra sale constituted an unregistered offering and sale of securities.  They wrote:  ""...in connection with Centra Initial Coin Offering (the ""Centra ICO""), Defendants raised over $30 million in digital cryptocurrencies by offering and selling unregistered securities in direct violation of the Securities Act.""  The complaint also accused the defendants of misleading investors about the nature of its relationship with card networks Visa and Mastercard, as well as listing fake team members on its website.  In a statement posted to its blog, the Centra team disputed the lawsuit filed by ""an alleged purchaser of Centra Tokens.""  ""This lawsuit, which for the most part, appears to repeat unfounded claims regarding Centra Tech, alleges that Centra Tech’s initial coin offering of Centra Tokens was an unregistered sale of securities. The plaintiff’s complaint attempts to mimic claims and allegations the Securities and Exchange Commission has lodged against other cryptocurrency offerors,"" the startup wrote, adding:  ""Centra Tech disputes the allegations in the complaint.""  The Centra ICO was notably promoted by Mayweather as well as music producer DJ Khaled prior to its completion. Though the timing is currently unclear, the original posts by Mayweather on Instagram and Facebook that promoted the sale appear to have been deleted, and a post on Instagram by DJ Khaled is also unavailable as of press time.  Neither Mayweather or Khaled were named in the suit.  Jacob Zowie, the plaintiff, is being represented by Komlossy Law and Levi & Korinsky LLP in the suit.

42380145,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MEnt,1513368000,US Treasury Report: DLT Data Storage Raises Oversight Concerns,"An oversight body within the U.S. Treasury Department believes the use of decentralized ledgers to store information ""may raise challenges"" for regulators, according to a new report.  The U.S. Treasury's Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) released its annual report on the state of financial markets and the nation's economy on Dec. 13. The FSOC was created in 2010 after the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law and is designed to monitor and report on perceived risks to markets in the U.S.  The report details that cryptocurrencies ""represent a different approach to payment,"" noting that, while only a small percentage of the population is currently using them, ""banks and other existing financial service providers have also entered the market.""  Echoing other parts of the U.S. regulatory ecosystem, the FSOC notes in the report that the tech's use could lead to issues for regulators, particularly in regards to information that is stored across a distributed network rather than one, centralized place.  The report's authors write:  ""As with any new development, virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies can create risks and vulnerabilities that call for continued regulatory monitoring and coordination. In particular, decentralization of data storage from [the] use of distributed ledgers may raise challenges for supervision and regulation, as current regulatory practices were designed for more centralized systems.  Those potential issues aside, the FSOC report posits that, currently, the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain more generally is ""small but growing."" And while deeming that the impact of these technologies on the broader financial system is ""likely limited"" at this time, the interest in its applicability to both payments and financial infrastructure warrants additional scrutiny.  ""However, in light of the growing number of market participants and financial institutions investing in these areas, it is desirable for financial regulators to monitor and analyze their effects on financial stability,"" the report states.

The development comes days after the company outlined four ethereum protocol changes that would restore access to the $275 million in ether frozen last month due to a vulnerability in the software. The four options, detailed in a blog post, entailed varying changes to the ethereum's software – specifically, the ethereum virtual machine (EVM) which translates smart contract commands in code.  Speaking at an ethereum developer meeting today on the subject, Parity spokesperson Afri Schoedon acknowledged that its suggested paths for unlocking the funds were perhaps unsuccessful in achieving a critical mass needed for its ideas to be coded, proposed and accepted on the network.  He said:  ""Actually, I don’t want to talk about it, except that one point is that Parity doesn’t want to follow up on the proposals, because we see the feedback was clear and loud.""  The comment came after Hudson Jameson, the Ethereum Foundation's communications lead, asked Schoeden about the proposals as part of the meeting's agenda.  In a follow-up conversation, Schoeden, who speaks on behalf of Parity at developer meetings and on public forums, told CoinDesk: ""We are not putting any more effort in improving these proposals.""  Parity Technologies has yet to make an official statement about its next steps, but shortly after today's developer meeting, the company tweeted that it will be reviewing its options following the response to its blog post.  The post received harsh criticism not only from ethereum users, but also developers of the open-source network. In a Dec. 11 blog post, ethereum core developer Nick Johnson warned that the code changes could result in dangerous and unpredictable outcomes.  ""Because of the risks and the level of uncertainty surrounding them, I personally can't recommend any of the four variants of this proposal for adoption,"" he wrote.

42380141,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MEmd,1513356637,US Commodities Regulator Proposes Definition for Cryptocurrency 'Delivery',"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has published a proposed interpretation of how it will deem that a cryptocurrency has been ""delivered"" from a buyer to a seller.  The agency – which more than two years ago announced that it would regulate bitcoin as a kind of commodity – gave two examples today of how a cryptocurrency would be considered ""delivered"" in the context of its rules.  As late as October, the agency said that it was still weighing the issue in light of the prevailing lack of clarity since 2015. The process was, perhaps, triggered in part by a $75,000 fine that was issued to digital currency exchange Bitfinex and the subsequent petition from U.S. law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP calling for a more concrete definition.  Now, the CFTC is taking the first steps toward publicly clarifying how it would define a ""delivery,"" which the agency said back in October was a complex issue given the wholly digital nature of cryptocurrencies.  According to the CFTC, the two factors which determine that a delivery has taken place are:    ""(1) a customer having the ability to: (i) take possession and control of the entire quantity of the commodity, whether it was purchased on margin, or using leverage, or any other financing arrangement, and (ii) use it freely in commerce (both within and away from any particular platform) no later than 28 days from the date of the transaction; and      (2) the offeror and counterparty seller (including any of their respective affiliates or other persons acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty seller on a similar basis) not retaining any interest in or control over any of the commodity purchased on margin, leverage, or other financing arrangement at the expiration of 28 days from the date of the transaction.""    Per the CFTC, the proposed interpretation isn't final and is subject to a 90-day public comment period, which begins when the interpretation is formally published in the Federal Register.

42380135,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCal,1513350036,$20k Bitcoin? Changing Charts Favor Crypto Rivals,"Bitcoin is on the rise against the U.S. dollar, but a look at all of its relevant trading pairs (LTC/BTC, ETH/BTC) suggests the move to $20,000 could take longer than expected.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has traded more or less sideways over the last few days as the alternative currencies rallied sharply to new highs. But, as discussed yesterday, the lackluster action in BTC could be due to the rotation of money from BTC (large cap) and into alternative currencies (or so-called small caps).  This flow of money is best represented by the bullish break seen in cross cryptocurrency charts – i.e. ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, BCH/BTC and XRP/BTC. For example, a rally in ETH/BTC could be an indication that the money is flowing out of bitcoin and into ether (ETH).  That said, a sharp pullback in the altcoins seems to have put a mild bid under bitcoin (BTC) today.  As per CoinMarketCap, bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated 7.57 percent in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ether (ETC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) have dropped 6 percent, 8 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.  While tables appear to have turned in favor of bitcoin again, the charts suggest relief could be transient.  ETH/BTC chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  A sharp rally from the low of BTC 0.0231 (Dec. 7 low) to BTC 0.0452 (Dec. 14 high) indicates the pair has bottomed out.  The drop to BTC 0.0371 is unlikely to last long as the 5-day MA is curled up in favor of the bulls and the 10-day MA has bottomed out (has shed bearish bias).  View  ETH/BTC is likely to regain bid tone and target the falling channel resistance seen at BTC 0.05. A close above the same would confirm the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  LTC/BTC chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  A long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, courtesy of high volume breakout (falling trend line breached).  The 5-day MA and 10-day MA are curled up in favor of the bulls.  The pullback from the high of BTC 0.02498 (Dec. 12 high) lacks substance, i.e. volumes have dropped. It looks more like a healthy pullback and the broader outlook remains bullish.  LTC/BTC 4-hour chart  View  The pair is likely to revisit the recent high of BTC 0.02498 (Dec. 12 high). The upward sloping 10-day MA indicates the dips below BTC 0.012 could be transient.  BCH/BTC  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  The falling channel is still intact, but the recovery from the low of BTC 0.068 (Dec. 8 low) to BTC 0.1289 (Dec. 14 high) has helped the 5-day MA and 10-day MA bottom out (shed bearish bias).  The bullish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover (short-term average cuts long-term average from below, is considered as a bullish sign) favor further upside in the cross pair.  View  The pair is seen moving higher to BTC 0.1589 (falling channel resistance) over the next few days. A close above the same (bullish channel breakout) would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  XRP/BTC  The above chart (prices as per Bittrex) shows:  The tide has turned in favor of the bulls, courtesy of a high volume bullish breakout and the upward sloping 5-day MA and 10-day MA.  Conclusion  As the charts show, a recovery in ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, BCH/BTC and XRP/BTC from intraday lows is already weighing over bitcoin.  As per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin is now trading at $17,760, down from the record highs above $18,000 hit earlier today.  The bullish outlook for ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, BCH/BTC and XRP/BTC indicates the rotation of money out of BTC and into alternative currencies is likely to continue in the next week.  It also means bitcoin could have a tough time staging a sustained rally to $20,000. This view gels well with the fact that investor community is warming up to the idea of a larger pullback in bitcoin following the BTC futures listing on the CME this Sunday.

42421808,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXv1Ab,1513346430,Blockchain Brain Drain Is About More Than Money,"Sandra Ro is managing partner and COO at startup UWINCorp and a former head of digitization for U.S. derivatives giant CME Group, where she spearheaded blockchain and cryptocurrency efforts.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Bitcoin at all-time highs, blockchain conferences multiplying like CryptoKitties. Things are certainly changing.  But, some things aren't exactly keeping up with the times.  During the last 50 years, humanity has made great leaps and strides in technological innovation, and yet, surveys and employment statistics consistently show dissatisfaction and lack of engagement by corporate employees. (A recent Gallup poll went so far as to indicate that 51% of the U.S. workforce is not engaged.)  Let's be clear, I am a capitalist and staunch supporter of free, globalized markets. However, personal experiences, from banking and market infrastructure have led me to conclude corporate culture has gone off-piste.  The end game is now a singular focus on ""hitting quarterly numbers and profits,"" in the case of a public company, or ""going IPO,"" in the case of startups  The problem is not that corporations make too much money. Many corporations earn a lot and do not take care of its people and the community with its resources.  It is not enough to form ""window-dressing foundations"" that offer employees once a year charity days or photo ops. It is not enough to donate some computers and paint a local public school and consider the job done.  Humanity-focused corporations  It does not need to be this way. This is not a zero-sum game, and in fact, it is imperative, we bring back humanity into corporate culture. We need to redefine what it means to be a corporation.  Today, there is already a growing movement of traditional financial executives leaving for opportunities in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector, but it's a growing trend that is about much more than money.  Many people want a mission and purpose in life that aligns with their own ideals, and most corporations are simply divorced from any kind of true to mission to solve social problems or help communities in a meaningful way as a part of doing business.  I propose to all blockchain entrepreneurs and developers that we construct and act by a new culture whereby our companies care deeply about its people and society's problems and act accordingly.  Work is a major portion of most of our daily existence. Yes, people need to make a salary to pay for daily expenses but work life needs to be more than about living to work or survive.  As blockchain technology and crypto assets create new paradigms and networks, I believe we have real opportunity to change and redefine the dialogue regarding corporate culture.  A few thoughts for consideration  Put people and relationships first. Hire people who share in the mission of the company and focus on retaining talent by keeping people engaged, not managing potential lawsuits and politics.  Get creative about compensation structures. Blow up the existing gap between highest and lowest paid employees. (One of my business partners and I are considering benchmarking and capping our senior management salaries in line with average employees.) We are looking at cooperative ownership models as well.  Full transparency in compensation is another idea we are discussing. Too much is hidden behind corporate veils at middle and lower ranks. There is no point in hiding compensation when people talk about it anyway. Let’s get real and fair. Ever see the Ted Talk monkey video on fairness? Monkeys know what’s up and we are no different.  Reward and incent employees to spend time on solving real social problems that are important to them. Part of one’s ""job"" should include helping their family, and others in need of help, including education. Being a good useful person in society and making a living wage should not be mutually exclusive. No joke.  Create a family and extended family (whether blood or self-made, doesn’t matter) support mechanism for mothers, fathers, caregivers. The population is getting older so what younger generations supposed to do? Work and support our parents/grandparents? U.S. laws for maternity and paternity leave lag behind nearly every major country’s laws – embarrassing. Mental health is another major issue. It is real; it is not to be shamed or hidden behind closed doors.  Sabbaticals and learning time: some companies do this well but too few and too little.  The next generation  Two very different worlds are colliding today: Established, traditional institutions and corporations and blockchain technology and the new world order it will bring.  Blockchainers around the world talk about the benefits of disruption and the transformative nature of peer-to-peer, decentralized, distributed networks. The technology may automate and reduce reliance on manual work. However, basic needs for human relationships and bonds do not change much.  Blockchain and crypto industry players have a key opportunity to shape and redefine the role of the corporation in society. Let's step up as next generation of industry leaders and change the way business is done by focusing deeply on people.  The current state of corporate culture is broken and needs our action.  Any entrepreneur with a company who is interested in joining this mission, please contact me. Let's create a group of like-minded global blockchain leaders working to redefine what it means to be a ""human-focused corporation.""

42411160,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gjRnmN,1513342800,Crypto Collectables? Ethereum's Next Killer App Is on Its Way,"As silly as it might sound, the popular CryptoKitties app might foreshadow a powerful up-and-coming use case for ethereum – digital collectibles.  After its launch last week, CryptoKitties quickly became the most popular ethereum app – so popular in fact that there's now CryptoPuppies (for those that prefer man's ""real best friend""), and CryptoPets (which lets users choose any kind of digital animal pet they prefer).  But while some in the crypto community are skeptical of this new trend (""Dear god no,"" said one reddit user to the idea of Pokemon on the blockchain), others see CryptoKitties as an unlikely pioneer in what could be one of the platform's biggest applications.  Blockchain thought leaders such as litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Earn.com CEO Balaji Srinivasan, to name a few, argue the app is ""actually important,"" because it shows the promise of using the blockchain to instantly transfer all kinds of assets without a third party.  Lesser known, though, is that there's reason to believe a real uptick in usable, consumer-friendly applications could be on the horizon. That's because the system for creating these collectibles hinges on a technical standard similar to ERC-20, the same tech that sparked the boom in initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017.  Strange as it may seem, your favorite furry fluffball is made possible by a powerful technical standard underlying CryptoKitties called Ethereum Request for Comments 721 (ERC-721).  ""People have been talking about [ERC-721] for a long time, but no one implemented it before. CryptoKitties happened to be the first,"" Philippe Castonguay, developer relations manager for cryptocurrency exchange protocol 0x, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""There's a very big market incoming for ERC-721.""  The utility of uniqueness  According to many crypto developers, ERC-721 is better suited for digital collectibles than ERC-20.  For starters, tokens created with ERC-20 are ""fungible,"" meaning every token is just as good as any other token, like every U.S. dollar is just as good as any other U.S. dollar.  While this is a necessary property for a currency, it isn't suited for ""crypto collectibles"" like CryptoKitties, since different cats need to have unique attributes, such as age, breed or color, permanently attached to them. In this way, some mixture of attributes within certain cats can become super rare, making them not only highly sought after, but also remarkably valuable.  One such cat on CryptoKitties traded for $110,000.  Secondly, ERC-20 tokens are divisible, meaning users can divide them up into tiny amounts for buying, selling or trading.  While this property is, again, useful for currency, it isn't helpful for collectibles, since collectibles are generally only as good as their condition.  In CryptoKitties, half a cat wouldn't be that fun or valuable to have.  All that said, there are still questions surrounding ERC-721. Although, it's quickly gaining traction and is already being used, it's not yet complete and several developers are unhappy with the code as it stands today.  As such, Castonguay expects the standard to evolve:  ""It will mature into a more robust and more acceptable standard over time.""  From punks to kitties  That said, the ideas underpinning ERC-721 aren't completely novel, but are instead iterations on already functioning digital collectible systems.  For example, CryptoPunks created its own non-fungible token for trading pixelated punk heads over ethereum (CryptoPunks has even seen a spike in usage since CryptoKitties launched).  Following the success of CryptoKitties, startups and developers are beginning to express interest in ERC-721 as a way of making crypto assets easier to use.  James Martin Duffy, co-founder of startup LoomX, which is working on scaling infrastructure for ethereum, told CoinDesk, he has plans to deploy projects using the standard going forward.  ""I see [ERC-721] tokens having huge potential in the realm of digital collectibles and online games,"" Duffy said. ""You could use them for digital playing cards ... or in-game items in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. The tokens could represent the swords, armor and other objects that your character has in his inventory. ""  And it doesn't stop there. According to Duffy, ERC-721 could also facilitate the tracking, trading and management of real-world assets such as houses or cars.  He's not the only one that's excited about the potential, though.  Developers of 0x, a decentralized exchange for ERC-20 tokens, see such a promising future for ERC-721 that they're planning to add support for the token soon. In this way, ERC-721 tokens can be traded for ERC-20 tokens and ether as well.  Castonguay concluded:  ""We see a future where all of these different kinds of tokens can be exchanged seamlessly.""

Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told the BBC's Newsnight program that buying bitcoin poses similar risks to gambling and, since it is neither backed by central authorities nor regulated, the cryptocurrency is not a safe investment.  Talking to Newsnight, he continued:  ""It is a very volatile commodity in terms of its pricing ... If you want to invest in bitcoin be prepared to lose your money – that would be my serious warning.""  Bailey went on to say that ""commodities"" like bitcoin are not regulated by financial watchdogs in the U.K., and that it was up to parliament to decide on any changes in those rules. However, citing the recent U.S. launch of bitcoin futures contracts by CBOE, he said: ""If you buy a future or if you buy an option then we do come into the picture.""  The FCA's director of strategy and competition, Chris Woolard, addressed the same subject back in June, cautioning investors that, as cryptocurrencies are not regulated financial instruments, they do not have the consumer protections associated with traditional assets.  And, in September, the authority also issued a formal warning on initial coin offerings (ICOs) stating that they constitute ""very high-risk, speculative investments.""

The U.S. Attorney's Office in the state of Utah is now working quickly to sell the 513.1490393 bitcoins (BTC), worth approximately $8.7 million at current prices, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. An almost equal number of bitcoin cash (BCH) is also to be sold (512.9274588), having a value of close to $949,000.  According to the court order:  ""The BTC and BCH have been transferred to a government wallet. Due to the volatile market for cryptocurrencies, the BTC and BCH risk losing value during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings ... For these reasons, the United States seeks an interlocutory sale.""  The order further said that cryptocurrencies will be sold and converted into US dollars using one or more commercial cryptocurrency exchanges in increments of 50 coins or less, in a move to safeguard against loss or fraud. The sale proceeds will be deposited into the Treasury Forfeiture Fund Suspense account.  As per the court documents, U.S. district judge Dale Kimball approved the sale of confiscated cryptocurrencies on Dec. 12 after the prosecutors in the case filed a request for the sale on the same day.  The case involves a Utah man, Aaron Shamo, who was charged with running a multimillion-dollar opioid drug ring out of a Salt Lake City suburb in Nov. 2016, and was considered among the largest busts of its kind in the country, an Associated Press report says.  Shamo and his alleged partner, Drew W. Crandal, were accused of selling fake prescription drugs on a dark web marketplace. The seized bitcoin gains were worth less than $500,000 when Shamo was arrested, another AP report states.  Back in 2015, the U.S. government held several auctions of bitcoin obtained through its investigation of the now-defunct dark market Silk Road. In September, the government finally acquired possession of the proceeds from those auctions after a long legal battle with convicted Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht, who had sought to regain possession of the funds.  In June, the South Korean government also sought to auction 216 bitcoins confiscated during a 2016 criminal investigation.

LendEDU, a digital student loan startup which has now published four such surveys asking various questions about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, polled 565 Americans between Nov. 9 and Nov. 13, 2017. It found that roughly 77% of participants believe bitcoin's price will grow more quickly in 2018 than it did this year.  While bitcoin started 2017 hovering just below $1,000, it was trading at more than $16,500 with highs above $17,000 as of Dec. 14, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Perhaps as a result, nearly 75% of investors plan to increase the size of their investments in bitcoin next year, with less than 10% not planning to, the LendEDU survey found.  On the other hand, about 31.5% of respondents plan to sell at least some of their bitcoin in 2018, with 40% stating they would not and 28.5% being unsure.  A smaller majority, 51%, said they would make at least one physical purchase using the cryptocurrency, with 30% being unsure if they would or not.  LendEDU stated that regulation could help stabilize bitcoin’s price, but excessive regulation could conflict with its core principles and alienate some of its supporters. When asked, some 50% of respondents said they would not like to see more regulation, while a hair over 30 percent of respondents said they would like to see more regulation.  The team stated:  “We found that the plurality of Bitcoin investors do not want additional regulation in 2018. However, we thought it was interesting to see that 20 percent of our respondents are unsure about the idea of increased regulation.”  This survey’s results align closely with those in previous months.

The 20th century, for example, began in 1914 with the burst of World War I and left the stage to the new millennium in 1989 when communist economies collapsed and opened to free enterprise.  For those interested in the practical future of blockchain, and of many other things, the year 2017 began on June 17, 2016. On that day, for the first time in human history, a robot ""stole"" more than $45 million from a group of human beings, following the instructions of an unnamed human being.  The robot has a name, instead, an infamous name: it was called The DAO. This robot had already broken a record: it was the first robot to get the control of more than $150 million, provided voluntarily by human beings by buying DAO tokens. The DAO was not a robot like those we see in the movies, that are often as emotional as human beings. The DAO was a real robot: a smart contract, a distributed piece of software designed to follow its internal code blindly and precisely.  So did he also when instructed to move $45 million to the account of the unnamed man, with instructions that were consistent with the code written for it. This code said also that this money would only become available 28 days later. And until then, the robot was going to protect the money from the unnamed man and from anyone else.  History happens  In the meanwhile human beings, as they often do, split into two opposite groups.  A minority thought that everything was fine, that there had been no theft since everything had been consistent with the code written for the robot. A majority, though, thought that what had happened was an error, a human error, a coding error, and that the unnamed man was a thief.  This could have been the beginning of a war. But we were not in the ""real"" world. We were on the blockchain, we were on ethereum.  The humans decided to redouble the distributed robot. One robot led the minority to protect the rights of the unnamed man, the other robot got a slightly new code and led the majority to the recovery of the stolen money. Both things happened… proportionally to the choice that human beings running the robot in a decentralized fashion made with their client software. It was the first big hard fork in the blockchain space.  In the meanwhile, The DAO had lost credibility, and its tokens were losing their value. Criticisms were made of the programmers, the community, its leaders. According to most observers, this was going to be the end of the concept of smart contracts and of tokens, or maybe even of the concept of public blockchain as a way to raise and store the value needed to carry on a project.  It was, in fact, the beginning. The explosion of ethereum, the ICO phenomenon and the forks of bitcoin that marked 2017 were the fires started by The DAO spark. Less shallow observers, in fact, in looking at that case, had spotted the beginning of a revolution.  For the first time, a blockchain had been able to collect millions on a real project. For the first time, the process had been tested, its weaknesses observed and governance solutions never seen before had been proposed, discussed and implemented.  People understood that the blockchain and the smart contracts were real. Now, ethereum was ready to become a hub allowing hundreds of projects to get funding more easily, more freely… maybe too easily.  This is what we observed in 2017, while bitcoin and ethereum ecosystem grew to the next order of magnitude. It was the year when it became obvious what the blockchain really is: a power to do things that were impossible before.  The idea that it is a technology for doing in a ""faster"" or ""cheaper"" way exactly the same things we have always done is misplaced. It is not necessarily cheap (often it is quite expensive) and when it does things faster, this happens because some fundamental principles have been changed, such as changing what we mean by ""accounting,"" what we mean by ""settlement"" and what we mean by ""privacy.""  The new network  This misconception is still holding back the development of the so-called ""private blockchains"" that saw so many experiments and proofs-of-concept in 2017, but nothing yet that was even marginally disruptive.  Even private blockchains can in principle be a transforming power. The principle of open entry is important for blockchain robustness, yet open entry can also occur within a range of actors that does not include the whole humanity, but only those that accept some rules and satisfy some requirements.  What, however, does not exist, is a blockchain that really works without shifting the balance of powers toward decentralization.  Even a centralized entity can make good use of a blockchain. But this happens only if the central authority wants to change its role from the ""validator of everything"" to become the ""validator of last resort"" or to become an ""invalidator"" that uses a proof of authority only in case of well-defined problems.  When a business is run on a blockchain, additionally, there is an unavoidable increase in transparency and in determinism. Even without necessarily losing privacy, certainly, players have to expect to lose some accounting opacity. And some elements of vagueness that are typical of paper-based business need to be lost.  And, last but not least, there are human controls that need to be replaced by cryptographic security and distributed automation if we want a blockchain to be of any use. Most private blockchains are vague, or even agnostic, on topics such as the governance and the balance of powers. They do not define who validates transactions, or what is the consensus protocol.  But the purpose of a blockchain is to innovate and define precisely these aspects! Most private blockchains are also vague in defining what kind of value will flow through digitally signed transactions and will be stored on the shared registry.  It may be digital versions of fiat currencies – yet unseen – or the IOUs of an institution, or even no value at all, just information. But a blockchain is a web network of value, if value does not flow one risks having a lame network.  What you missed  An often overlooked truth in the noise about cryptocurrencies, blockchain and smart contracts is that they mark the entry of robots in the field of transactions and contracts.  This means that, as robots start driving cars, they will also start managing our money, our transactions and our agreements in a decentralized fashion, with the purpose of making them less reliant on centralized control or multiplication of intermediaries. This is happening already in the public blockchain, and this is what the public blockchain has shown, also in 2017.  Not everyone, unfortunately, has been able to see what was really going on.  Even the name smart contracts may have been a misnomer, hiding the fact that ethereum smart contracts are more ""robot counterparties"" than “contracts” in the classic sense. But we may remind that Nick Szabo, in the paper that introduced the concept of smart contracts, described the ""humble vending machines"" as the ""primitive ancestors of smart contracts."" (So were the old juke-boxes. The first reassuring prehistoric robots we got accustomed to giving our money to.)  Of course, many will be frightened of obtaining decentralization, transparency and higher guarantees through giving part of control to that special kind of immaterial robots that are called smart contracts.  I feel the need to make two remarks here. First, the DAO showed clearly that such a fear is not irrational. Yet, we will probably get over it. (Self-driving cars are still creepy, for reasons that are surely rational.) Yet, they will grow in reliability and will drive us all, and this is likely to start sooner rather than later.  Second, there are ways to make smart contracts less frightening. Although decentralized automation is needed for a smart contract to work, smart contracts can be designed to be ""state channels"" that formalize rights and set constraints in a bilateral flow without the need of robot counterparties.  This is what we have seen in some proposals for private blockchains.  More importantly, state channels can be the foundation of a mixed private-public approach to smart contracts, where agreements are taken bilaterally and, as long as the two counterparties agree, the exchange of value happens off-chain in a layer-two bilateral communication.  Just in case settlement is needed, or a dispute emerges, a representation of the current state of the transaction between the parties is sent to a public blockchain to be settled, potentially following some pre-agreed code whose hash is stored on the blockchain.  This can also be a solution to the scalability problem that exists in current blockchains, where for each and every transaction all validating nodes have to run the code of the smart contract. This can also be a solution to the privacy issue that still makes many institutions wary of the blockchain. (Another solution to privacy may come from ring signatures or zero-knowledge proofs, and we may see relevant breakthroughs in 2018, probably coming from the efforts of researchers and the public community on the topic.)  All this points to the fact that the year to come, 2018, could be the year when (financially oriented) human beings and (smart contract) robots make contact.  And start understanding each other, marking the arrival point of a process started with The DAO failure.  And so I have spoken more of 2016 and 2018 rather than of this 2017 that comes to an end. This was maybe to be expected, since the present is, in the end, just an immaterial veil between the past and the future, a haze on the path where the flow of time, technology and innovation is taking us, fuelling our fears for what we have not yet fully come to understand.

42380133,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MCUT,1513308911,Mimblewimble's Small Step: Grin Raises Funds for New Development,"The most active software implementation of the much-anticipated mimblewimble technology is launching its first fundraising campaign.  Mimblewimble has gained notoriety  as a way to improve the privacy and scalability of blockchains broadly, but also for the Harry Potter references that have long cloaked its developers in secrecy (the protocol's name comes from a curse in the books).  And continuing this trend of novel design decisions, the developers behind the software, called Grin, notably won't be launching an initial coin offering (ICO), instead asking for donations in already existing cryptocurrencies in exchange for the faith the project will be completed.  According to the campaign announcement, Grin is solliciting $30,000 in bitcoin to support a year of full-time work for one of the project's most active contributors: developer Michael Cordner, known as ""Yeastplume"" in the Grin community.  Grin lead developer Igno Peverell said of Cordner in the announcement:  ""[He] has been doing an outstanding job on the project for over six months now, and has done so in addition of a day job and a family. He's been the first to contribute large chunks of functionality, and his continued help has been invaluable.""  Bitcoin technology company BlockCypher is among the first to donate to the effort.  With that, the fundraiser also seems to be a sign of a maturing community, one interested in putting more time and effort into advances its ideas past the theoretical.  Case in point, mimblewimble developers are gearing up for the launch of a second testnet in the spring next year, which will add features such as aggregate signatures and a recently unveiled privacy technology, Bulletproofs, to its blockchain.  Initially, MimbleWimble engineers saw themselves adding the technology to bitcoin someday by way of a sidechain, but as they waited for the technology to mature, the team instead decided to launch its own blockchain, with a forthcoming cryptocurrency.  Developers have been testing the project on the first testnet since November, and have used a series of hurdles – including the fact that the blockchain ""split in many ways"" – as a learning experience before the mainnet launch sometime next year.  In a status update outlining progress, Peverell noted:  ""Testnet1 has been bumpy, but extremely useful.""
