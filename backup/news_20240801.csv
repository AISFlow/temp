31809948,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632714,1722555001,"Would Bitcoin Fall Below $60,000 Again? Analyst Reveals A Concerning Trend For BTC","Amid the continuous blend of bulls and bears from Bitcoin in recent months, Trading Guru Peter Brandt has shared in his latest post a worrisome pattern observed on the Bitcoin price chart. According to Brandt, Bitcoin appears to be on a downward trend. The legendary trader said in a recent post on Elon Musk’s social media platform X: “The series of lower highs and lower lows continues.” What Are the Implications Of This Pattern Notably, the consistent lower highs and lows as observed by Brant might just be an indicator to a cooling of the recent bullish fervor. Since Bitcoin has hit a peak above $73,000 in March, the asset has been unable to reclaim this all-time high. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Poised for a September Price Surge? What Traders Need to Know Particularly, whenever BTC attempts to rally, moving closer to its March peak, the asset only appears to hit a ceiling at the $70,000 region and then trade lower than the previous swing low. This pattern of consecutive lower highs and lower lows is traditionally seen as indicative of a bearish trend at play. While Brandt’s post can be seen as quite insightful, the comment section of the post suggests that is not the type of insights many are looking for. Scrolling through the comments, Brandt faced criticism for this highlighted pattern. An X user specifically pointed out perceived inconsistencies in Brandt’s bullishness for Bitcoin, citing previous comments made by Brandt that were more optimistic. WTH @PeterLBrandt you were bullish a week ago saying how great the chart looked!! — Jordan Wirsz (@JordanWirsz) August 1, 2024 Regardless, other prominent figures in the crypto space were more candid with their comments. Willy Woo, for instance, weighed in on the discussion, noting: That’s the thing with short term markets, you never know if the “lower high” was in fact the lower high before the next rebound or in fact it really printed, you only know with sufficient hindsight. What’s Behind The Current Bitcoin Downtrend? Meanwhile, Bitcoin is facing bearish pressure. The asset has fallen by 5.1% in the past 24 hours to trade below $63,000 at a price of $62,901 at the time of writing. This decline has erased more than $50 billion from its market cap in just the past day alone. Interestingly, despite this bearish performance, Bitcoin’s trading volume has surged over the same period from $24 billion yesterday to $28 billion as of today. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO On Bitcoin: ‘We’re Not Bullish Enough’ – Here’s Why According to a CryptoQuant author on the QuickTake platform, the current plunge in Bitcoin is caused by the movements in age band in which large sum of BTC been held for years has moved since the asset touched the $70,000 mark recently. Despite this selling pressure, the analyst noted: We are very close to a recovery, but it seems like it will take a bit more time. I strongly recommend checking the age bands to monitor potential liquidity and sales.

31806673,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632698,1722549612,Why Did This Crypto Whale Spend $400 Million Buying Bitcoin Yesterday?,"On-chain data shows a particular Bitcoin whale who accumulated almost $400 million between July 30 and 31. This whale is believed to have purchased the flagship crypto, having seen an opportunity to profit massively thanks to Bitcoin’s recent price action. Bitcoin Whale Purchases Almost $400 Million Worth Of BTC On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that a Bitcoin whale (12QVs…oN2qo) has withdrawn 5,800 BTC ($387.88 million) from Binance in the past two days. This purchase suggests the whale anticipates higher prices from the flagship crypto soon enough and is looking to profit from such a price rally when the time comes. Interestingly, this purchase comes amid a decline in Bitcoin’s price, meaning that the whale sees this as a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity. Bitcoin dropped to as low as $63,500 on July 31, having rebounded to almost $70,000 days ago. This price drop can be attributed to several factors, including concerns over reports that Iran had ordered a retaliatory attack against Israel for killing Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting was held on July 31, and the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also said little to suggest that an interest rate cut could come in September, another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s recent decline. Despite its recent decline, Bitcoin is expected to enjoy another rebound soon enough and possibly break above the $70,000 range on its next leg up and rise to an all-time high (ATH). Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe recently mentioned that Bitcoin looks good to continue toward a new ATH next month as long as the flagship crypto stays above $60,000 to $62,000. Whales Heavily Accumulated BTC In July Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Bitcoin whales, holding at least 0.1% of BTC’s circulating supply, bought over 84,000 BTC in July. This represents these whales’ largest monthly wave of Bitcoin accumulation since October 2014. These investors looked to take advantage of the price dips that Bitcoin suffered in July. Bitcoin’s price crashes in June extended into the beginning of July, as the flagship crypto dropped to as low as $55,000. However, this BTC accumulation from these whales paid off, as the crypto token enjoyed a massive rebound in the latter parts of July and a monthly close in the green. These whales will still hope Bitcoin can record more impressive gains in August. Data from Cryptorank shows that Bitcoin has historically not enjoyed the best price action in August, ending the month in the red on eight occasions since 2011. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $64,400, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The shares have recouped some of their losses since then.  Marathon reported revenue of $145.1 million versus an estimate of $157.9 million, according to FactSet data. The company's sales took a hit in the second quarter due to several operational challenges which hindered its ability to mine bitcoin as well as recent halving weighing on the mining sector, Marathon said in its earnings release.  ""During the second quarter of 2024, our BTC production was impacted by unexpected equipment failures and transmission line maintenance at the Ellendale site operated by Applied Digital, increased global hash rate, and the April halving event,” said Fred Thiel, the firm's CEO, in a statement.  However, Marathon said that the issues have since been remedied and the company reached an all-time high mining power of 31.5 exahash per second (EH/s) in the second quarter.  The miner also said that its second quarter adjusted EBITDA swung to a loss of $85.1 million from a gain of $35.8 million in the previous year, mainly due to unfavorable fair value adjustments of its digital assets and lower BTC being mined in the quarter.  Despite the challenges, the miner continues to see reaching hashrate of 50 EH/s by the year-end and plans to growth it further next year.  Marathon sold 51% of the bitcoin it mined in the second quarter to fund its operating costs. However, it recently announced that it bought $100 million worth of bitcoin in the open market and re-adopted strategy to fully hold all BTC in its balance sheet. The miner now holds more than 20,000 BTC in its balance sheet.  ""During the quarter, we organized the internal structure of the business to better align with our growth opportunities, sharpen our strategic focus, bolster accountability, and accelerate our speed and agility as we scale,"" said Thiel.

The company's second quarter adjusted Ebitda missed Wall Street's expectations.  Coinbase (COIN) second-quarter revenuebeat the Wall Street analysts' estimates slightly as the industry continues to recover from the crypto winter, sending the crypto exchange's shares higher.  The crypto exchange said its second quarter total revenue was $1.45 billion versus average estimate of about $1.4 billion, according to FactSet. However, the second quarter adjusted Ebitda of $596 million came in lower than the consensus of $607.7 million.  Coinbase’s biggest source of income comes from transaction fees, which slipped 27%from the previous quarter as trading volume fell 28%. One of the bright spots for the exchange in the second quarter was the subscription and services revenue which grew 17% from previous quarter.  ""On a Q/Q basis, subscription and services revenue benefited from higher average USDC on-platform balances and USDC market capitalization, as well as higher average crypto asset prices - notably SOL and ETH,"" the firm said in a shareholders letter.

31803364,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632701,1722544201,"Bitcoin’s Price Potential: Analyst Maps Path To $700,000 And Beyond","Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride ever since it reached its all-time high (ATH) of $73,737 back in March. However, regardless of that, several analysts and traders in the crypto community remain persistent in their bullish outlook for the asset. An example is Willy Woo, a well-known figure in the crypto sector. Earlier today, Woo shared his optimistic view on Bitcoin and insights on how high BTC’s price could potentially climb to hit this anticipated high mark. Bitcoin Road To $700,000: Tough Or Smooth? According to Woo in his latest post on Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, Bitcoin’s price projection can range dramatically based on the percentage of global wealth assets allocated to Bitcoin. In his explanation, Woo outlined two possible future scenarios for Bitcoin’s valuation: a more probable lower band and a highly unlikely upper limit. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO On Bitcoin: ‘We’re Not Bullish Enough’ – Here’s Why He pegs the “conservative” estimate for Bitcoin at roughly $700,000, assuming modest adoption and investment levels. This figure arises from a hypothetical allocation of a small percentage of global wealth into Bitcoin, reflecting a growing but cautious integration of Bitcoin into the broader financial sector Woo’s analysis further delves into how institutional investors might influence Bitcoin’s value over time. Drawing from industry behaviors and recommendations, such as Fidelity’s suggestion that portfolios include 1-3% in BTC, Woo interprets these movements as signs of growing, although conservative, confidence in Bitcoin as a viable asset class. He contrasts these figures with BlackRock’s 85% investment, highlighting a stark divergence in institutional strategies towards Bitcoin. The theoretical upper limit of Bitcoin reaching $24 million per unit, according to Woo, would require an unrealistically complete conversion of the world’s $500 trillion in wealth assets into Bitcoin. He dismisses this scenario as improbable, focusing instead on the more grounded predictions supported by current investment trends and economic behaviors. Woo explains that as Bitcoin’s adoption curve follows the classic S-curve of technological adoption, which currently sits at 4.7%, the potential for significant price increases remains viable as adoption grows towards the 16% to 50% range. What The Future Holds In his concluding thoughts, Woo speculates about a future where Bitcoin’s market capitalization could surpass all global fiat currencies. This paradigm shift would transform investor priorities, moving away from fiat-based valuations towards a new economic model where major corporate assets could be measured against their BTC holdings, rather than traditional fiat metrics. Related Reading: Is A Major Bitcoin Dip Coming? What the Coinbase Index Tells Us This shift, he argues, would mark a profound change in financial thinking, focusing on assets that can leverage Bitcoin’s stability and growth rather than merely surpassing its value. Once the price produces a marketcap exceeding all the fiat in the world you won’t be interested in ultimate price. That’s a fiat mindset based on current realities. After this inflection point, you’ll only be looking for investments that can beat BTC.

The loss came as the company took an impairment charge on its bitcoin holdings of $180.1 million versus $24.1 million in the second quarter a year ago.  Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company disclosed July 31 bitcoin holdings of 226,500 tokens, up a handful of coins since the latest purchase announcement in mid-June. Those 226,500 bitcoins were acquired for $8.3 billion or an average of $36,821 per token. At the current price of $63,500, those assets are worth about $14.4 billion.  ""On the adoption front, we are extremely optimistic with the improved understanding of bitcoin and the increasing support for the ecosystem from bipartisan politicians and institutions on display at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville,"" said CEO Phong Le in the earnings release.  The impairment charge reflects the loss or gain of the company’s bitcoin holdings compared to the price that it was purchased at. While new accounting guidelines allow for companies to mark to market their digital asset holdings, firms are not yet required to do so.  Checking operations, the company posted $111.4 million in revenue versus analyst estimates of $122 million, according to FactSet.  Shares fell 6.5% in the regular trading session prior to earnings on Thursday alongside a steep fall in both stock and crypto markets. MSTR has more than tripled over the past year as the price of bitcoin more than doubled over the same period.

Bitcoin Is Again Retesting The Short-Term Holder Realized Price As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a new post on X, BTC’s latest drawdown has led to it doing another retest of the short-term holder Realized Price. The “Realized Price” here refers to an indicator that, in short, keeps track of the average cost basis of the investors or addresses on the Bitcoin network. When the value of this metric is greater than the spot price of the cryptocurrency, it means the average investor in the market could be assumed to be holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, the indicator being below the asset’s value suggests the dominance of losses on the blockchain. Related Reading: Ethereum Seeing High Exchange Outflows, But Watch Out For This Bearish Signal In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of the entire userbase isn’t of interest, but that of a specific segment of it: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs include all the investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price for the STHs over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot price had slipped under the STH Realized Price in June, but it finally managed to break above the line halfway through last month. In the weeks since the asset has seen a couple of pullbacks back to the line, but it has managed to find rebounds each time. Now, after the latest decline, the coin’s price is once again retesting the level. Historically, the STH Realized Price has been a reliable point of support for the cryptocurrency during bullish periods. The explanation behind this pattern may lie in how investor psychology works. The STHs represent the fickle-minded side of the sector, who are sensitive to change. As such, whenever the price retests their cost basis, they may be prone to making panic moves. In times when the atmosphere in the market is bullish, the STHs may believe such a retest to merely be a dip opportunity, so they could decide to accumulate more. This could be why Bitcoin has found rebounds at the level in the past. While the level has generally been reliable indeed, this latest retest that BTC is facing is already the third within a narrow period. “Each time a level is tested, it becomes weaker,” notes Maartunn. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Signal: Shark & Whale Population Sharply Growing It now remains to be seen if the Bitcoin STHs still carry a bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency or if the constant pullbacks have put fear on their minds. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued its recent bearish momentum in the past 24 hours as its price has slid another 2% to reach the $64,700 level.

The attacker created (minted) 58 million of the protocol's CVG token using a vulnerability in the protocol's codebase, and swapped the tokens for 60 wrapped ether (wETH) and 15,900 crvFRAX stablecoin using liquidity pools on Curve, web3 security auditing firm QuillAudits said.  Blockchain data on Etherscan shows that the attacker's address converted the funds to ether {{ETH}} and sent the tokens to Tornado Cash.  The attack caused about $210,000 loss, QuillAudits added.

Inspired by Kabosu owner’s new dog, Neiro, a new wave of Shiba Inu-themed tokens surged on Solana. However, Its Ethereum-based competitor has stolen the show with its stellar performance in the last four days. Kabosu’s Sister Sparks New Memecoin Wave Kabosu, the dog that inspired the legendary Doge meme, passed away in May. The beloved dog also inspired the flagship memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE), and a plethora of Shiba Inu-themed tokens. Its owner recently announced she had adopted Neiro, a 10-year-old rescued Shiba Inu dog. Related Reading: Ethereum Seeing High Exchange Outflows, But Watch Out For This Bearish Signal Following the announcement, the crypto community saw the launch of several tokens inspired by the dog. Most of these tokens were deployed on Solana, initially pumping to millions in market capitalization. On its first day, the largest Solana-based Neiro meme coin reached a $100 million market cap. However, it has since plummeted over 80% to a market capitalization below $20 million, possibly due to the overabundance of Neiro tokens on the chain. The token was also heavily criticized after online reports called out alleged insider activity from the developers. Blockchain data firm Bubblemaps revealed that the developers of the largest Neiro token deployed on Solana had control of 6% of the token’s supply and eventually sold it for $5.7 million. Since then, the meme coin has seen a massive 84% price drop, going from its all-time high (ATH) of $0.12 to trading at $0.019. Are The Dog Days Back? The Ethereum-based Neiro stole the show from its Solana counterparts. The token has seen remarkable growth in the last four days, hitting a $200 million market cap on August 1. Since its creation on July 27, Neiro has registered a 4,400% surge, shredding two zeros as a result. Additionally, the token reached a new ATH price of $0.20 after soaring 81% from the day before. Nonetheless, the developers of Ethereum’s Neiro have also been accused of insider trading. Following the massive surge, Bubblemaps alerted investors that the token allegedly “is heavily controlled.” According to the report, 78% of the memecoin’s supply was sniped at launch and quickly spread among 400 wallets. The firm revealed that the wallets had sold 12% of their holdings, around $4.5 million, by July 30. Investors seemed unfazed by the reports, with many calling the report “bullish news.” Others expressed excitement by the firm’s “fudding,” stating, “A lot of the most successful memes require supply control.” Related Reading: Solana Looks ‘Ripe To Push Higher’, Is A Mania-Like Rally To $600 Coming? Moreover, many investors consider “the dog days are back” and the “Doge legacy continues” with the Ethereum-based memecoin.

ESMA wants to prevent unauthorized companies from finding loopholes to proactively reach out to EU clients.  The European Securities and Markets Authority published some clarity on Wednesday for crypto companies dealing with overseas firms to prevent them breaking the Markets in Crypto Assets rules (MiCA).  Companies that are not authorized to operate in the trading bloc of 27 nations cannot provide any services to European Union clients unless those clients reach out first. With Thursday's guidance, ESMA wants to prevent unauthorized companies from finding loopholes to proactively reach out to EU clients.  The opinion by ESMA, an independent EU body tasked with investor protections, detailed actions it believed could be unlawful solicitation of clients. The regulator said it would be illegal for an EU-authorized broker to systematically route orders it receives to a group's execution venue if that group is located outside the EU and the broker hasn't explored any alternative options.  ESMA also deemed it unlawful for legal brokers to rely on the brand of an overseas exchange when advertising to attract business from EU citizens to the point that it makes it difficult to distinguish its services.  Included in the mix of illicit activity would be if the authorized broker has limited revenue from EU clients ""or has revenue flows that significantly diverge from what would be expected where an independent broker and independent execution venue interact,"" the paper said.  MiCA does allow EU-authorized brokers to offer exchange services such as exchanging crypto-assets for funds or other crypto-assets to EU clients, and to enter into agreements with non-EU entities to both manage liquidity and hedge their risk, ESMA said.  However, companies ""should pay close attention to situations where an established hedging scheme has the main purpose or effect to channel EU order flows systematically and automatically to a unique non-EU execution venue and, in particular, where this non-EU execution venue is part of the same group,"" the report said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/01/eu-regulator-details-how-it-classifies-unlawful-overseas-businesses-under-mica,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3736f3ac55cb3ec93d5c2102d129158cf662ca4c-3314x1864.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407777,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga4LK9,1722529509,Crypto Exec Pushing for Industry Support of Kamala Harris for President,"A former chief executive of a crypto platform is trying to build a crypto following for Vice President Kamala Harris, hoping to raise money and secure industry endorsements for the Democratic presidential candidate.  Former Uphold CEO J.P. Thieriot says he's hoping to counter the digital assets sector's recent enthusiasm for former President Donald Trump.  The former CEO of crypto platform Uphold, J.P. Thieriot, is trying to drum up crypto support for Vice President Kamala Harris as she pursues the Democratic nomination in the presidential election, arguing that former President Donald Trump is offering empty promises to the industry and Harris is signaling a new openness.  Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2024 race, has quickly become the crypto favorite, garnering big-money support from industry leaders as he adopts enthusiastic cheering for the digital assets sector (which he'd looked on with open skepticism until recently). But Thieriot said there seems to be ""a real opportunity to help shape the Harris campaign’s position on crypto.""  ""Of course, she's going to have to do some stuff to gain trust, but she has signaled she'd like a chance,"" said Thieriot, who said he still retains a stake in Uphold and is building a new crypto trading operation, in an interview. ""It would be crazy to not engage on that.""  He said he wrote a strategy paper with a wider group, which included crypto lawyers who he declined to name. They shared that document with Harris' campaign this week and are awaiting a response.  ""We would argue that crypto is this electoral cycle’s foremost interstate swing issue,"" said the strategy paper, which was reviewed by CoinDesk. ""Trump has already moved to try to capture this space, and raised significant capital, essentially offering vague platitudes and no meaningful policy commitments.""  The paper suggested an opening crypto fundraiser in San Francisco and predicted that Harris could garner endorsements from prominents crypto figures and potentially earn tens of millions in campaign donations from the industry. Thieriot said he's setting up a website, and the effort can be contacted at info@crypto4kamala.com.  Industry support has most loudly gravitated toward Trump, who spoke at the recent Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tenn., and who says he'll put a stop to the government resistance to cryptocurrency typified by the actions of Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and the opposition of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).  Read More: In Donald Trump's Own Words – a Partial Transcript of His Bitcoin 2024 Speech  Despite President Joe Biden's appointment of Gensler and ongoing support of his oversight of the cryptocurrency sector, ""Kamala has, I think, an opportunity at a clean slate,"" Thieriot said. The strategy he and the other supporters have in mind: She makes it clear her administration will work with the industry and support clear rules for it, and she shows openness for a friendlier chief at the SEC.  Thieriot isn't alone among crypto insiders now favoring Harris. Tonya Evans, a prominent crypto law professor and board member of the Digital Currency Group, argued that Harris offers a chance for a new course that differs from the Gensler/Warren views that have dominated this administration. Evans is involved in a group of decentralized finance leaders favoring the vice president, which has scheduled a Thursday organizational meeting.

The Appellate Court of Montenegro issued a ruling confirming an earlier decision from a lower court, the High Court of Podgorica, to send Kwon to South Korea instead of the U.S., which is also seeking his extradition.  Both countries want to try Kwon for criminal charges tied to the $40 billion implosion of the Terra/LUNA ecosystem in May 2022. Terra was the first proverbial domino to fall in a sequence of high-profile crypto company collapses that year including FTX, the second-biggest crypto exchange in the world.  Kwon went on the lam shortly after Terra’s collapse. In September 2022, Interpol put out a red notice for Kwon. Six months later, in March 2023, he was arrested and subsequently jailed in Montenegro for attempting to use a fake Costa Rican passport to fly to Dubai. Kwon was initially given a four-month sentence for using falsified documents, but remained in prison until March of this yeart, when he was released on bail without his real passport, which was confiscated to prevent him from leaving the country.  Thursday’s decision is expected to put an end to months of back-and-forth over whether Kwon should be extradited to South Korea, which submitted its extradition request first, or the U.S. Kwon successfully fought against earlier rulings to extradite him to the U.S. but, when the High Court of Podgorica ruled to send him to South Korea, the country’s Supreme Court stepped in to postpone it after the country’s top prosecutor issued a statement arguing that the court’s decision overstepped the limits of its power. There have been numerous court rulings overturning previous decisions to send him to one or another of the two countries.  A truly final decision on where Kwon will be extradited can only be made by Montenegro’s minister of justice, according to the Office of the Supreme State Prosecutor. Montenegro's Prime Minister, Milojko Spajic, is a personal investor in Terraform Labs, Bloomberg reported earlier this year.

31793988,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632643,1722528057,Chainlink At Risk: Key Indicators Signal Further Losses To $12,"Chainlink (LINK), one of the major players in the decentralized finance space, is currently facing increased bearish pressure in the market. As LINK’s bearish momentum continues to build, key technical indicators are signaling the potential for further loss toward the critical support level at $12 for the cryptocurrency. With this current price movement, Chainlink could continue to decline, testing lower support levels in the near future, unless there is a significant reversal in market sentiment. This article provides an in-depth analysis by evaluating the current market sentiment around Chainlink, examining key technical indicators, and identifying critical support levels along with their implications for LINK’s price stability. As of the time of writing, it had a market capitalization of over $7.7 billion and a trading volume of over $243 million.LINK was down by 3.75%, trading at around $12.82. In the last 24 hours, both the asset’s market cap and trading volume have declined by 3.72 and 1.67, respectively. Assessing Current Market Sentiment Around Chainlink Considering the asset’s price movements, it seems the current market sentiment around LINK is still negative. The price, currently, is actively trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), heading toward the $12 mark on the 4-hour chart. This suggests that the bearish trend might continue. With more selling pressure, this position indicates that Chainlink is likely to decline further as long as it remains below the SMA. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) signal line has successfully dropped below 50% into the oversold zone. This suggests that selling pressure is growing, and the asset might experience further downward movement towards the $12.44 level. On the 1-day chart, LINK’s market sentiment is also negative, with the price trading below the 100-day SMA. LINK is showing a bearish trend as it moves toward the $12.44 support level, having formed two bearish candlesticks. If the price breaks below this key level, it could signal further bearish momentum and potentially drive the price toward other support levels. Finally, the 1-day RSI has also dropped below 50%, which further supports the possibility of further price drop. This decline suggests that bearish pressure is rising, as sellers are still active and influential in the market. The fact that sellers are still active implies that LINK will probably continue to decline. Identifying Critical Support And Resistance Levels Chainlink is currently on a bearish path, heading toward the $12.44 support level. If the price breaks and closes below the $12.44 support level, it may continue its bearish movement toward the next support range at $11.10 and possibly even lower levels. However, if the digital asset encounters resistance at $12.44 and fails to break below, it could lead to a potential upward move, reaching the $15.25 resistance mark. Should the price rise above this level, further gains could occur, targeting the $17.96 resistance point and beyond.

At press time, bitcoin was lower by 5.5% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the broader CoinDesk 20 Index's 6.1% decline. Ether {{ETH}} was off 5.8%, Solana {{SOL}} 10% and XRP {{XRP}} 10%. It was roughly 72 hours ago when bitcoin touched more than a four-month high just above $70K.  Markets received what nominally was good news on Thursday morning, with the U.S. July ISM Manufacturing PMI falling far more than economist expectations, sending interest rates to multi-month lows across the board. Also, U.S. initial jobless claims jumped to their highest level in about one year. Taken together, the data adds to ideas that the U.S. in on the cusp of a monetary easing cycle by the Federal Reserve – usually thought of as bullish for risk assets, bitcoin among them.  Speaking yesterday following the Fed's policy meeting, Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that a rate cut for September is very much on the table should the data continue to show slowing economic growth and inflation.

That's all well and good, but bitcoin bulls now need to consider that Trump's victory chances are not what they were two weeks ago when his foe was to be Joe Biden. New Democratic nominee-apparent Kamala Harris' odds of winning the election have steadily risen throughout the week to the current 44%, according to Polymarket. Trump's victory chances have faded to 55% versus 70% just two weeks ago.

42407772,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga4LAE,1722525098,Galaxy Digital Second-Quarter Net Loss Widens as Crypto Market Retreats,"The loss is almost four times as wide as that of the corresponding quarter a year ago.  The company cited declines in digital asset markets for the result. Bitcoin fell 12% in the second quarter.  Digital asset financial services company Galaxy Digital (GLXY) posted a second-quarter net loss of $177 million, almost four times as wide as the year-earlier period, as crypto markets retreated.  The New York-based company, whose units include trading, asset management and investment banking, said it's still in the process of incorporating in Delaware and looking to list on Nasdaq. Last month it bought almost all the assets of CryptoManufaktur, including almost $1 billion of ether {{ETH}}.  Founder and CEO Mike Novogratz has previously said Galaxy's aim is to become the ""Goldman Sachs of crypto."" Its fortunes could be seen as a bellwether for the wider industry due to the array of different sectors it operates in.  Many of the company's activities were hit by the decline in crypto markets. Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, slid 12% in the three-month period, the most since fourth-quarter 2022.  Revenue from counterparty trading slumped more than 50% to $24 million compared with the year-earlier quarter, driven ""by lower trading volumes"" and ""unfavorable asset price movements"" a company statement shows. Bitcoin rose 7% in the year before and touched record highs in first-quarter 2024.  While mining revenue rose 2% to $24 million, the direct mining profit margin narrowed to 56% from 64%, driven by April's mining reward halving.  Galaxy is among the issuers of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs in the U.S., which it has listed in partnership with investment manager Invesco. The bitcoin ETF (BTCO) has assets under management of $525 million, while its ether equivalent (QETH) holds $15.3 million, according to data by TradingView. Total assets under management at Galaxy Asset Management were $4.6 billion.  For the first half, the New York-based company posted net income of nearly $245 million, an increase of more than 175% on first-half 2023.  Galaxy's shares fell 11.8% to C$14.63 as of 12:09 p.m. in Toronto (16:09 UTC).

42407775,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga4L3c,1722524400,Crypto for Advisors: Crypto and Politics in the U.S.,"In today’s issue, Jason Leibowitz, head of private wealth at Hashnote, examines the current political climate in the U.S. and its potential impact on the crypto industry.  In Ask an Expert, Connor Farley, CEO of Truvius, discusses Millenial’s interest in crypto investments and how advisors can help them.  – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  The Election Effect and Beyond: What’s Driving Crypto Markets?  A major influence steering the crypto market today is the presidential election this November. This pivotal race, coupled with recent significant developments, has fostered a bullish environment for digital assets. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a reliable barometer of broad-based crypto market performance, has been rallying in response to these catalysts. Investors can access the CoinDesk 20 Index through private funds, offering a direct and efficient way to gain exposure to this burgeoning asset class.  Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee and current frontrunner in the election, has emerged as a staunch advocate for cryptocurrencies. Last weekend, on July 27, he delivered a rousing keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. Addressing an at-capacity crowd, Trump laid out his vision for the U.S. to become the global hub for crypto innovation. He pledged to replace Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler, known for his anti-crypto stance, a promise that was met with enthusiastic approval from the audience. Trump’s commitment to holding onto the approximately 200,000 bitcoin currently in the US government's possession, labeling it a strategic stockpile, underscores his dedication to integrating digital assets into national policy.  This pro-crypto stance is echoed by Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, who holds a significant amount of Bitcoin. Vance's investment reinforces the campaign’s commitment to the digital asset space, appealing to a growing voter base interested in the burgeoning asset class.  Senator Cynthia Lummis' proposed legislation, which calls for the U.S. government to purchase 1 million bitcoin to hold for at least 20 years, adds another layer of potential bullish impact. While it remains unclear how realistic this may be, such a move could bolster market confidence, not to mention the potential of spurring competition among nation-states to acquire strategic reserves of Bitcoin, driving prices higher.  Crypto has evolved into a bipartisan issue, with both political parties increasingly embracing the industry. Vice President Kamala Harris, seen as the de facto Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race, is reportedly engaging with crypto firms, indicating a shift towards a more supportive stance on digital assets. This bipartisan appeal is crucial, as it suggests that regardless of the election's outcome, the crypto market could benefit from favorable policies.  Moreover, 2024, being a Bitcoin halving year, has already reduced the supply of newly mined bitcoin, creating scarcity that traditionally supports higher prices. The introduction of spot ETFs for both Bitcoin and ether is another bullish indicator. These ETFs are expected to continue attracting new capital into the crypto market, drawing both institutional and retail investors. However, while ETFs provide exposure to price movements, private funds can offer additional yield opportunities through strategies like staking on long ETH positions, which ETFs cannot replicate.  Another factor is the Federal Reserve’s anticipated rate cut later this year. Historically, a dovish Fed has been bullish for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The expectation of lower interest rates may encourage more investment into the digital asset market.  Against this dynamic backdrop, the CoinDesk 20 Index efficiently reflects these bullish trends. In the 24 hours following Trump's speech and the positive policy signals, the Index surged to new highs not seen since the spring, even though it was a weekend when most traditional markets were closed. The 24/7 trading capability of crypto markets allows for real-time pricing of significant developments, giving investors immediate feedback on market sentiment. This market trades fast and often, so engaging with experts in the crypto field, rather than traditional finance professionals who may lack specific knowledge, is crucial for navigating this complex and rapidly evolving asset class.  The confluence of these events creates a robust outlook for the crypto market. As the election approaches, the crypto market is poised for continued growth. The combination of political support, institutional adoption, and favorable economic policies sets the stage for a potentially significant upward trajectory. The recent market low on July 5th may have signalled the bottom of the current cycle for this secular bull market, paving the way for sustained growth in the months ahead.  - Jason Leibowitz, head of Private Wealth, Hashnote  Ask an Expert  Q: Do my Millennial clients want crypto in their portfolios?  A: Not only are Millennial investors interested in crypto, but according to a recent FINRA report, Millennial investors primarily invest in crypto (57% of surveyed investors) compared to mutual funds (43%) and individual stocks (38%). This is a staggering figure suggesting generational conviction in the long-term growth potential of the digital asset class.  Q: What does this mean for advisors?  A: Millennials stand to inherit the largest generational wealth transfer in history ($84 trillion in assets over the next 20 years). With digital assets currently represented in most Millennial investors’ portfolios, it's difficult not to see digital asset adoption accelerating alongside blockchain technology itself.  Advisors must acclimate themselves with digital assets, how to introduce crypto into an overall asset mix, where to access digital asset investment products, and how to easily and compliantly get their clients suitable crypto exposure.  Q: How should I advise on crypto for Millennials?  From an investment advisory standpoint, familiarity with only bitcoin and ether is insufficient crypto awareness. It overlooks the broader fundamental value and diversifying properties both within and across the various sectors that comprise the digital asset class. Institutional investors know this and are already seeking multi-asset, actively managed crypto investment products.  Advisors should start by familiarizing themselves with the broader crypto market, including the various sectors (DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc.) and size segments (mega-cap, large-cap, mid-cap, etc.). Then, advisors should identify readily accessible investment products, such as SMAs, that provide diversified portfolios of numerous assets and span passive and active styles. These types of crypto investment products are supported by the time-tested portfolio theory seen with traditional investment strategies. Given the more diversified nature of these products, they reduce single-asset concentration risk and help cater to the gradation of investor risk and return preferences.  - Connor Farley, CEO, Truvius  Keep Reading  According to BlackRock's chief investment officer of ETFs and index investments, bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds will soon be part of model portfolios.

Nevertheless, expectations that Dogecoin will eventually cross $10 remain high as one analyst has given reasons why the largest meme coin by market cap is set to surge by more than 7,200%. Dogecoin To Stage A Log Breakout Crypto analyst Javon Marks took to X (formerly Twitter) to share an interesting development on the Dogecoin chart. Marks points out that a Log Breakout could be on the horizon for the meme coin, which could lead to a massive surge in price. Related Reading: Hedge Fund Manager Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $428,000 If This Happens The reason for the analyst’s optimism toward the Log Breakout are what transpired for Dogecoin the previous two times that it has appeared. The first time this Log Breakout was completed for DOGE was back in the 2017-2018 bull market. This resulted in a 9,472% price increase, taking Dogecoin from a low of $0.0002 to a high of $0.01858. Then again, in the 2020-2021 bull market, Dogecoin would undergo another Log Breakout, this time leading to an even more prominent rally than before. This was the legendary 28,882% rally of 2021 when the DOGE price went from $0.0012 to almost $0.74. Given this historical performance and taking into account that breakouts like these often rhyme with their previous appearances, the crypto analyst believes that the Dogecoin price is set to undergo another major rally soon. How Far Can DOGE Rise? In his analysis, Marks presents his own expectations for the Dogecoin price should the Log Breakout be completed. According to the chart shared in the X post, Marks expects an at least 7,200% increase in the DOGE price from the current level. This would put the meme coin above $10 for the first time in history. Related Reading: This PEPE Holder Cohort Is The Reason Price Is Struggling To Reclaim $0.00002 The crypto analyst explains that each Log Breakout has led to a larger rally than the last, so this could mean that the DOGE price could rally higher. However, with the Dogecoin market cap already so large, such immense rallies could be hard-fought from here. In addition to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu is another meme coin that the crypto analyst is bullish on. In an earlier analysis, Marks pointed out that the second-largest meme coin by market cap had confirmed a macro Hidden Bullish Divergence. Given this, he expects that the Shiba Inu price could rise 354% from its current level to reach its all-time high levels around $0.000081.

We are setting up for the next leg higher. Our Elliott Wave analysis is in agreement with WealthUmbrella’s unique on-chain analysis, which sees readings that are consistent with lows, not highs. We are confirming our price target of $106,000 - $190,000. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is the best performing asset in market history. There is no stock or asset that has come close to delivering the returns of this digital currency -- it has greatly outperformed all FAANGs, and all outliers in the history of the markets. Yet, Bitcoin is also unusual in that its volatility is equally as historic, capable of regular +70% drawdowns that inevitably push to new highs within an average of 2.5 years. The sane approach to the immense, yet volatile, opportunity that Bitcoin provides is to use risk management. Understanding what Bitcoin is and why governments have been unable to squash the currency is also instrumental to being a successful Bitcoin investor. Since 2019, our firm has helped our readers understand this unique protocol and why it’s worthy of rivaling the world’s most valuable stocks. However, with that said, it’s technical and on-chain analysis that keeps you in the game with Bitcoin . Our goal with Bitcoin and other life-changing tech stocks is to participate in the outsized returns, while side-stepping painful periods of volatility. For example, in early 2021, we cut our position in half when Bitcoin was trading between $50,000 - $64,000. This was after accumulating between $7,000 - $20,000. We then started accumulating again in December 2022, when we went on record stating that Bitcoin was a buy in the $16,000 region. Though we are in the 4th bear cycle in Bitcoin's history, the prior 3 cycles suggest where we are is a rare buying opportunity. There is ample evidence to support the $15,500 level is either a major low or very close to a major low. Both the technical and on-chain analysis support this.” Bitcoin does not have classic fundamental analysis to guide investors, therefore, technical analysis and a new field of on-chain analysis has been a rewarding approach to managing Bitcoin’s risk. In our last report, we stated that we are raising our overhead targets to $106,000 - $190,000 . The technical and on-chain analysis supported this stance, and still does. While bitcoin tested the upper region of our support zone, we believe that the low is likely in. We are setting up for the next leg higher, and setting up our final purchase within the current Bitcoin bull cycle. The Truth About Bitcoin’s Upside and Downside The below chart shows four of the best investments in US market history. From their IPOs, Apple (AAPL) is up +143,000%, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)(BRK.B) is up +215,000%, Nvidia (NVDA) is up +285,000%, Microsoft (MSFT) is up +445,000%. Tech Insider Network Here is the same chart, measured in percentage increase, when we add Bitcoin in with the four of the best stocks in history. Tech Insider Network These stocks don’t even register in comparison to Bitcoin’s returns since it began mysteriously trading in October 2009. Since this release, it is up an incredible +8 billion percent (not a typo). However, many have argued that it did not really start gaining public recognition until one year later, and that should be the true starting point for measuring its returns. So, to be fair, from October 2010, it is still up a staggering 665,000,000%. This is not a feature of the past. Since its recent low in 2022, Bitcoin is up 336%, outpacing all but one of the Mag 7 including AI stocks such as Broadcom ( AVGO ). Tech Insider Network What makes this valuable to a portfolio is not only the alpha it has generated, but the fact that it has such a low correlation to tech stocks. The below chart measures the correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the Mag 7 + Broadcom. Anything between +50 and +100 means the two are highly correlated, between +50 and -50 means no correlation, and between -50 and -100 means inversely correlated. Tech Insider Network While delivering superior returns than all of the great large-cap tech stocks in this bull cycle, minus Nvidia, it did so while having a low inverse correlation to tech. As of right now, while tech is seeing outsized volatility due to a much-needed rotation in the equity markets, Bitcoin has an inverse relationship to these stocks, moving higher against the volatility. As a portfolio manager who seeks unique diversification in the form of a growth asset, this is very valuable. It’s easy to miss this key quality to Bitcoin’s price action without looking closely at the data. Unusual Volatility Another intriguing point about Bitcoin’s performance can be found in analyzing its volatility. Most investors are well aware it’s highly volatile, and thus stay away. Since inception, it has seen four drawdowns of 70% or greater. These are drops that most assets rarely recover from, and if they do, it takes years to decades before reclaiming those highs. However, every time bitcoin has seen one of these large drawdowns, it has fully recovered within 2.5 years, on average. This is rare, and I don’t know any other asset that has done this multiple times. Tech Insider Network Regardless of your feelings toward this polarizing asset, it’s worth asking why it is up so much, and why it quickly recovers unlike any asset the market has ever seen? If it truly were a bubble, then why doesn’t the bubble pop? Instead, the asset comes back stronger than ever and reclaims all-time highs. Bitcoin is here to stay, and it is worth understanding why this is. Revolutionary Tech That Solves a Problem Bitcoin was designed to disrupt the oldest and most powerful system in the global economy – centralized banking. It is a global asset that offers an exit from the centralized fiat system. This is a concept that is new to everyone, as all money is understood in relation to personal banks, and centralized banking. During the great financial crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper on Bitcoin, introducing it to the world. In that paper, the intended purpose of Bitcoin was stated: The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.” Bitcoin is a value exchange that needs no intermediary. It sidesteps counterparty risk that is inherent to banking and cannot be inflated through politics and questionable centralized policies. It was designed to be a hedge against another banking crisis, and potential inflation crisis. Over the last decade, we have been forced into the greatest monetary experiment in recorded history. Central banks held interest rates at zero for nearly a decade, while some held them with a negative rate. In all of recorded history, there has never been an instance where a debtor was charging interest to give them a loan. Yet, this is what we saw in many industrialized nations for many years. No one knows how this experiment will end, as there is no precedent for it in history. As a result, investors continue to see unsettling stats, like: Global Debt/GDP at 90.8%, U.S. Debt/GDP is 127%, Japan Debt/GDP 268%, $517B in unrealized losses on bank balance sheets while FDIC now has 63 banks on problem list in 2024. Maybe this gets resolved without any concern. But if it doesn’t, we may actually get a chance to see if Bitcoin’s stated purpose can offer an alternative to what the unwinding of this excess may do to a currency. Our firm understood this, and regularly published on the bigger picture for our readers since 2019. We publicly established a position in Bitcoin at $7,717 within a month of launching our site following a free article we wrote in 2019 where we predicted Bitcoin will exceed the markets cap of the world’s most valuable companies. My prediction is that once the Lightning Network is built out, bitcoin will surpass the market cap of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon to reach a minimum of $50,000 per token. This is because the protocol solves critical needs for global populations, including the reduction of financial fees for 7 billion people, and offers a need to store money during times of inflation…Technically speaking, bitcoin is also the world’s most secure financial network. The transfers eliminate 3% in processing fees and hedges against inflation. This can, and should be, worth as much as a search engine, enterprise software, a social media network, warehouse fulfillment ( AMZN ) or iPhone hardware. The problem that bitcoin solves is underestimated (or worse, not understood). Bitcoin offers global populations a digital alternative to centralized fiat currency. The masses have been quite clear, whether from El Salvador, Venezuela, Japan or Africa, --- the 7 billion+ people in this world seek a way to sidestep risks that global citizens face by handing over their assets to centralized banks and governments. These people seek a true and secure way out of the centralized banking world, and those who do not embrace this will be left behind by holding only centralized currency without diversification. Technical Analysis Bitcoin has no management team, no earnings reports, and no fundamentals to base an investment decision. The large swings in both directions are seemingly at random. Through technical analysis, we can determine these swings are not random, and instead, get a reasonable means to both establish risk controls and determine buy and sell targets. From an aerial view, it’s important to identify the direction of the trend. The easiest way to do this is to look for the vertical moves and the overlapping/messy corrections. In other words, which way are the vertical moves – up or down? This is your dominant trend. Tech Insider Network In 2022, the vertical moves were down, which were interrupted by short and shallow bounces that were overlapping and messy. These were corrections within the dominant trend, and that trend changed in late 2022. Note how the vertical moves since then have been up, while the overlapping corrections have been down. Today, we are in another overlapping and messy retrace of the vertical moves higher. This means that we are likely in a correction within a larger uptrend. The Elliott Wave count we have been following since before the 2022 low, which can be found in the prior December 2022 Report , adds more context to the upward trend we are currently in. Tech Insider Network We are in a large 5 wave pattern, which is targeting well above $100,000. It is an incomplete pattern, and needs 2 more large swings higher to complete the full 5 waves. Like with all 5 wave patterns, we have bought on each dip, and continue to buy as long as we stay above critical support, which is now at $42,750. Above this support zone, and the odds favor higher levels. Furthermore, all 5 wave patterns are fractal. In other words, a small 5 wave pattern turns into a larger one, and so on, until you hit your target. We see 5 wave patterns (vertical moves) in the direction of the dominant trend, and 3 wave patterns (overlapping corrections) as counter moves, or pauses, within the dominant trend. If we analyze the current correction and bounce off the low, it appears that we are setting up for the next vertical move higher. Tech Insider Network We have a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July. From this low, look at what has developed. This is a clean, vertical, 5 wave bounce, which suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally. The next pullback will be where we add our last tranche in this bull cycle. Since this cycle started, we have been systematically accumulating, while raising our critical supports along the way. Below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that we have issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. Tech Insider Network While we don’t expect to always buy the bottom and sell the top, through technical analysis, we can safely and systematically play the middle, which offers alpha and diversification to modern-day portfolio management. On-Chain Analysis For those that are not familiar with on-chain data, it offers unique fundamental analysis within crypto, and is a relatively new field of study. We partnered with WealthUmbrella, a team of machine learning engineers and professors, to provide this level of analysis within the crypto space. According to WealthUmbrella, the underlying strength that our technical analysis is picking up on is also being supported within on-chain data. The below section was written by Vincent Duchaine, CEO of WealthUmbrella. The Spot Bitcoin ETF approval in January triggered a rare move in Bitcoin that quickly brought us to new all-time highs (ATH) around $73,000. This move also created some of the most overbought conditions we have seen throughout Bitcoin’s history. One of the key indicators we use to gauge these overbought levels is what we call our Metcalfe's law discount/premium model , which measures the value of Bitcoin’s network through the increase/decrease in active users. At the prior ATH in Bitcoin, this indicator gave us a reading of 3.3 standard deviations ahead of the fair price. For reference, this was in the 99.9th percentile of all Bitcoin readings and is consistent with what we see around cyclical tops in Bitcoin. WealthUmbrella In light of this extreme reading in one of our key metrics, we still maintained “ that the bull cycle in Bitcoin will likely move higher .” This was the right call, as we have been in a large consolidation since. The current correction has now allowed our Metcalfe's law discount/premium model to cool down to a level that is consistent with a healthy, which we typically see in an ongoing bull market. WealthUmbrella In fact, the last time we reached such a reading was in October 2023 when Bitcoin was trading around $29k. Bitcoin's price then climbed 69% to a price of $49k, before its first large consolidation in the current bull cycle. As Bitcoin's market cap increases, the chances that we continue to see vertical moves of that magnitude does decrease. If Bitcoin climbs at least $20k, like in the previous run, this would still put Bitcoin at around $90k before the next consolidation. This, we believe, is a conservative assumption. WealthUmbrella As stated earlier, while the above metric was flashing a warning, none of our other cyclical top indicators agreed. For example, our primary cyclical top indicator, which we call the Kwiatkowski top/bottom indicator , was nowhere near the reading that we see around major tops. This indicator measures the different Bitcoin capitalizations, as well as Bitcoin miner revenue to Hashrate ratio, and has a remarkable correlation with significant tops and lows. More encouraging, this indicator is now finding support in areas that are more consistent with early bull markets, let alone major tops. It recently went to a reading where Bitcoin has always bounced back in a bull market over the last two cycles. This suggests that $52k was likely the bottom of that correction. WealthUmbrella These specific indicators helped us successfully call the bottom when Bitcoin was around $16k in December 2022 , and they kept us on the right side of the recent correction when many were calling for a major top. This is further supported by the supply and demand equation in Bitcoin that is now back in a healthy relationship. Regarding demand, while the net buying volume in the ETFs is starting to pick up, the amount of newly created accounts with a non-zero balance seems to have bottomed out and is now climbing. I personally believe that the attention Bitcoin is currently receiving in the ongoing US presidential race lends legitimacy to Bitcoin and will continue to attract more people to this asset. WealthUmbrella On the other side of the equation, supply is now more scarce following the halving, with now only 450 Bitcoins being mined per day. Following the Spot ETF approval, the number of coins that did not move for more than a year was consistently dropping, indicating that long-time market participants were willing to finally sell. This movement has now come to a stop and, if we exclude one single massive transaction that occurred in June where a huge amount of very old coins moved, this number is now significantly on the rise. WealthUmbrella In summary, we have remained steadfast in our assertion that bitcoin has been and remains a buy. To transparently discuss ongoing buy plans is rare, and very few investors offer this level of real-time transparency on positions they already own. We were one of the first firms to offer real-time trades on this volatile asset since 2019, but most recently we offered granular and concise discussions around our buy plans in December 2022 , and since have continued to discuss our buy plans in April 2023 , December 2023 , April 2024 . We are now asserting, yet again, that Bitcoin is a buy in July 2024. Our technical analysis is suggesting that we are completing a correction within a large and unfinished uptrend. The next dip, we believe, will be the last opportunity to buy before we resume going vertical. Our Elliott Wave analysis is in agreement with WealthUmbrella’s unique on-chain analysis, which sees readings that are consistent with lows, not highs. This is while we are measuring a notable rise in demand, with consistently less supply. This is the basic condition for seeing a good uptrend in Bitcoin. With this information, we are confirming our price target of $106,000 - $190,000.

42390671,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5TRt,1722521225,'Golden Boys' Move on CompoundDAO Wasn't a Governance Attack: Tally Protocol CEO,"It's hypocritical to accuse parties of running a ""governance attack"" against a DAO when voter participation is low, the co-founder and CEO of Tally Protocol said.  In order to create a better DAO governance environment, stakeholders need to be incentivized, just like in the traditional finance world.  You can't blame people for playing by the rules. And the recent resolutions by a group of governance-token holders to create a yield-bearing product on the Compound lending protocol were not a ""governance attack,"" according to Dennison Bertram, CEO and co-founder of Tally Protocol.  Just because other COMP token holders responded with apathy doesn't make Humpy and the Golden Boys' proposal an attack, he said. Smart contracts were not exploited, and the actions taken were within the rules of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that runs the protocol.  What it shows is that the democratic process of governing a DAO is imperfect and needs improvement.  ""Someone had a really strong opinion that was outside social norms, and they did the requisite legwork necessary to get it to pass,"" Bertram said in an interview. ""Many of the people that you should expect to vote no on something like this didn't show up.""  Take, for example, the latest proposal from pseudonymous Humpy, the Golden Boys' ringleader. The proposal to create goldCOMP – which they agreed to cancel as part of a resolution – garnered only a 49% participation rate in the voting process.  This lack of participation has been noticed by many observers of the DeFi industry.  Bertram said the recently announced Tally Protocol, which will be in testnet within the next couple of weeks, is an attempt to address the low participation and attention in DAO governance by creating incentives for active engagement.  Tally has previously raised two rounds in 2021 in order to build out DAO governance dashboards and tooling.  Through a process called governance staking and restaking, the protocol allows users to mint Tally Liquid Staked Tokens (tLSTs), which are tokens that earn passive, auto-compounding yield while maintaining governance rights for DAO participants, Tally explained in a post.  By staking governance tokens with Tally, users receive tLSTs that earn passive yield and can still vote back at the DAO.  This mechanism ensures token holders are rewarded for their participation rather than just holding tokens passively and waiting for the price to hit the right amount so they can exit.  ""People need to be paid to run these billion-dollar organizations,"" Bertram said. ""Not only do you not get paid to participate in these organizations ... you actually have to spend your free time reading the forums, digesting these posts, understanding what they mean, auditing the code, showing up, and actually paying your own money to vote.""  Bertram points out that swings in token prices can result in misaligned incentives.  ""DAOs fail at both ends of the spectrum. If the token price of a DAO goes to zero, it's dead. If it goes to infinity, everybody sells their token because that's the maximum financial opportunity,"" he said.  That behavior underlines the need for participants to be compensated proportionally for their contributions.  The program also differs from a dividend, which is given out to any shareholder, even completely idle ones. To separate DAO tokens from securities – which the SEC often accuses them of being – DAO token holders must be rewarded in proportion to their efforts.  ""By attaching an economic incentive that's proportional to performance, you drive towards more sophisticated, more attention-paying, more driven participants,"" he said.  After all, nobody is doing all this work in TradFi organizations with the market cap of Compound for free. The COMP token has a market cap of about $450 million, according to CoinGecko data.  ""What the Tally Protocol does is really say the quiet part out loud: The people who operate protocols need to have value returned to them in proportion to their contributions to the organization.""",NEUTRAL,COMP,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/01/golden-boys-move-on-compounddao-wasnt-a-governance-attack-tally-protocol-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac2fe10f3475415836ac30def7147147eb284495-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390665,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5Sx7,1722520800,Crypto Lending Firm Morpho Bags $50M in Funding Round Led by Ribbit Capital,"Morpho did not disclose a valuation based on the funding, which was raised by a private token sale.  Morpho previously raised $18 million in 2022, when the DeFi firm’s CEO, Paul Frambot, was still in his third year at college.  Morpho, a decentralized cryptocurrency lending protocol, raised $50 million in a strategic funding round led by Ribbit Capital, an early-stage investor in fintech firms including Robinhood, Revolut and Coinbase.  Also participating in the private token sale were heavy hitters like a16z crypto, Coinbase Ventures, Variant, Pantera, Brevan Howard, BlockTower and Kraken Ventures. Morpho’s valuation based on the funding was not disclosed. The company raised $18 million of funding back in 2022, when the firm’s CEO, Paul Frambot, was still in his third year at college.  The goal here is to take the relatively rarified and inward-looking world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and fuse it with the base protocol layers of the internet.

31787612,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632613,1722517254,Hoskinson Claims Cardano Will Flip Bitcoin As Leading Crypto,"In an interview with the hosts of “Altcoin Daily,” a popular cryptocurrency-focused YouTube channel, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, made bold assertions about the future of Cardano in relation to Bitcoin. Addressing nearly 1.5 million subscribers, Hoskinson laid out a vision for Cardano that he believes will not only compete with but eventually surpass Bitcoin as the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Why Hoskinson Believes Cardano Will Flip Bitcoin Hoskinson’s argument hinges on the unique attributes of the Cardano ecosystem, which he claims will drive its growth to surpass Bitcoin. He outlined a comprehensive strategy that leverages global adoption and technological superiority to position Cardano at the forefront of the crypto space. “If we can do what I’m saying, there’s no way to beat Cardano,” Hoskinson claimed, adding, “At the end of the day, it has lived up to what Satoshi started.” Related Reading: Institutional Investors Show Interest In Cardano, Triggering 300% Surge He drew attention to the global efforts underway to integrate Cardano into various economic and political systems. These efforts, according to Hoskinson, are not isolated but part of a coordinated push to establish Cardano’s utility across continents. “Some people are in Argentina right now and they’re fighting like hell to get the Argentine government to adopt some things. Some people are in Ghana right now fighting like hell to get the Ghana government to do things,” he elaborated. Elaborating on the dynamics to build a system of global size, Hoskinson claimed: “So if you build a growth engine that doesn’t lose its people and it’s always adding people and you build a growth engine where you can absorb all the technology of your competitors at some point, you just outgrow and then you wake up and it’s a multi-trillion dollar ecosystem with trillions of dollars of value moving around around every single day.” Related Reading: Cardano Among Alts Likely To See Price Boosts, Santiment Says Central to Cardano’s strategy is the empowerment of a decentralized community that actively contributes to the platform’s development. Hoskinson detailed the operational dynamics within the Cardano ecosystem, noting the presence of over 300 decentralized applications (dApps) that are not only live but thriving. “Every one of them has a team and a CEO and all kinds of people, and they’re fighting like hell to get their stuff growing,” he emphasized. Bitcoin = MySpace? The Cardano founder stressed the importance of designing systems that bring communities together to take collective action towards common goals. This community-centric approach, he argued, is what will ultimately enable Cardano to “flip” Bitcoin. He asserted that Bitcoin’s current value proposition mirrors that of legacy technologies like Yahoo and Myspace, which dominated their markets until they were disrupted by more adaptable and innovative competitors. “Bitcoin stalled. The only value proposition it has is it’s big and successful, that’s it. It’s not some new technology, it’s not some new capability, it’s not the fact that it’s super easy to use it to go and do something interesting. It’s big and successful, that’s what Yahoo’s value proposition was. That’s what Myspace’s value proposition was. Network effects don’t mean anything in technology,” Hoskinson said. The Cardano founder also discussed the upcoming release of Midnight, a new development in the Cardano network, which he believes will catalyze the addition of hundreds of partner chains. “There’s people wanting to be partner chains and once Midnight is out and if it’s successful, there’ll be hundreds of partner chains coming and people are building and launching,” according to Hoskinson. In conclusion, Hoskinson reiterated his belief in the foundational principles of decentralization, first principles thinking, and the creation of an incentivized, integrity-preserving system. These elements, he asserted, are essential for building a technological infrastructure that can serve as the voting, payment, and identity systems for countries worldwide. “The only way is embracing decentralization, first principles thinking, preserving the Integrity of your system and creating the right incentives for millions of people who don’t know each other to come and use that technology in the right way and also the ability to absorb new ideas.” At press time, ADA price stood at $0.3855.

42390670,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5TMl,1722517210,Crypto VC Paradigm Invests in MetaDAO as Prediction Markets Boom,"MetaDAO, a Solana-based governance experiment, raised millions of dollars from venture backers who think prediction markets should decide event outcomes.  Paradigm led the funding round for a months-old project that is building governance structures that rely on market forces rather than votes.  Political bettors are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into their expected outcomes on crypto-powered prediction markets: for example, who Vice President Kamala Harris will pick as her running mate.  MetaDAO takes the idea further: the Solana-based governance experiment just raised millions of dollars from venture backers who think prediction markets should decide outcomes.  VC giant Paradigm recently led a $2.2 million funding round in MetaDAO, a months-old project building governance structures that rely on market forces rather than votes. This construct is called a futarchy. Its proponents believe market participants are driven to make better choices than, say, politicians.  The round comes as the 2024 elections are putting a spotlight on crypto's blisteringly popular prediction markets. According to data site Dune, market leader Polymarket currently boasts nearly $90 million in open interest, a record for contracts that ask bettors to predict the outcomes of world events, like political shakeups.  The hubbub around prediction markets gave MetaDAO an edge in fundraising, Proph3t, MetaDAO's pseudonymous founder, told CoinDesk in an interview. He said his pitch to investors highlighted the similarities: “'If we see Polymarket as a machine then it made sense to me that we’d want to use a truth machine to make decisions.'""  Paradigm was co-founded by Fred Ehrsham, also the co-founder of the Coinbase crypto exchange. The firm has been a vocal supporter of prediction markets, for example as a way for businesses to hedge political risks.  Paradigm will own 3,035 tokens, making it META's single largest holder at 14.6% of the total supply, according to Proph3t, MetaDAO's pseudonymous founder. Around 30 angel investors bought an additional 965 META tokens for a total raise of $2,229,950.  Futarchy in action  MetaDAO's rendering of futarchy centers on the value of its token, META. Any proposal for the group to take action gets a ""pass"" and ""fail"" market where traders can speculate on META. The outcome of the proposal depends on which of these markets end with a higher token price. A proposal only passes if META is worth more in the ""pass"" market than the ""fail"" market.  Last month, MetaDAO's chief ""futards"" (who go by the handles Nallok and Proph3t) proposed the project sell a couple million dollars-worth of META tokens to pay for engineers, office space and other startup costs. META traders approved: they bid META up to $435 in the ""pass"" market, while contracts in the ""fail"" market sat at $386. The proposal passed; the fundraise proceeded.  MetaDAO puts a different spin on governance than the other self-proclaimed ""decentralized autonomous organizations"" (DAO) in crypto. Most DAOs treat their tokens as votes and the token's holders as voters. In MetaDAO, anyone with money to spare can directly influence an outcome.  The project garnered major interest in the Solana ecosystem at February's mtnDAO hacker house gathering in Salt Lake City. It has since become an active evangelist for futarchy. MetaDAO is working with a handful of other Solana-based projects on implementing their own betting market-based systems.  One of those partners, the trading platform Drift, is using MetaDAO tech to determine which projects get grants of its DRIFT token. Co-founder Cindy Leow told CoinDesk the implementation is ""showing really positive signs"" and has seen one proposal accepted, and another rejected.  ""This tells us the community is thinking very carefully around spend and governance budgeting,"" she said.

The bitcoin halving and the launch of ether ETFs in Asia drove increased demand for the company’s services in the second quarter.  The platform saw a 29.8% jump in retail lending in Q2.  Ledn, a crypto lending platform, processed over $1.16 billion in digital asset loans in the first half of 2024, the company said on Thursday.  Events such as the recent bitcoin {{BTC}} halving and the launch of ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Asia contributed to growing demand for the company’s services in the second quarter, it said in a release.  Of the $1.16 billion total, loans to institutional clients accounted for $969 million, the lender said. The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January and the subsequent rally in the world’s largest cryptocurrency spurred this institutional adoption and allowed Ledn to process several hundred million dollars in loans to ETF market makers.  The platform saw a 29.8% jump in retail loans between the first and second quarters, with lending rising to $85 million from $65.5 million, the company said.  In terms of demographics, North America led in the second quarter with $17.6m in retail loans, Ledn said, with Latin America accounting for the second-largest number of onboarded retail clients.  Crypto adoption has been booming in Latin American countries in recent months due to economic pressures, political volatility and other reasons, the firm said.  ""While we can’t speak for other crypto lenders, we estimate that Ledn is likely now responsible for more than 50% of the retail loan originations given the fall out of the other lenders, which signifies the growing acknowledgement, trust, and consequent demand for digital assets from retail investors,"" CEO Adam Reeds said in an email to CoinDesk. ""Overall, we see the surge in retail loans as an indicator of continued evolution and maturity of the crypto sector as a whole, rapidly establishing it as a fully viable alternative to traditional finance and banking.""  The company noted that there is a growing trend of clients using digital asset-backed loans for tax reasons, as borrowing against crypto is normally a non-taxable event.  The crypto lending sector is making a comeback thanks to spot bitcoin ETFs and creditors receiving their assets back from bankrupt companies, Ledn’s co-founder, Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, told CoinDesk in an interview at the Consensus 2024 conference in Austin, Texas.

42390681,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5UC3,1722513660,First Mover Americas: Crypto Markets Reel on Geopolitical Risk,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto prices were firmly in the red following the Fed's decision on Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged. Cautious comments from Chair Jerome Powell on the possibility of a rate cut in September were compounded by escalating tensions in the Middle East. Iran's leaders ordered retaliation against Israel for killing Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which may also have spooked investors and traders. Bitcoin traded around $64,500 during the European morning, about 2.5% lower than 24 hours ago. The broader digital asset market has dropped nearly 4.24%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).  Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms' second-quarter loss trebled to more than $84 million, or $0.32 per share. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose to $61.2 million, more than half of which comprised stock compensation expenses related to new grants under a long-term incentive program. The net loss for the quarter also included a $76.4 million drop in the fair value of bitcoin it holds. April's Bitcoin halving, which cuts the reward miners receive for adding new blocks to the blockchain by 50%, reduced the number of bitcoin Riot produced during the quarter. The company mined 844 BTC, 52% less than in the year-earlier period.  Ripple will allocate $10 million to a tokenized version of U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills) that will become available on the XRP Ledger for the first time. The short-term U.S. government debt is being issued as TBILL tokens by the tokenization platform OpenEden. Assets backing the tokens will be invested in short-dated U.S. Treasuries and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasuries. The tokenization of tangible real-world assets and traditional financial securities is a growing sector of the crypto industry. It allows traditional assets, especially private and alternative assets, to be issued, managed, and distributed in a way that is considered more efficient than their off-chain counterparts.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the most active bitcoin options on Deribit in the past 24 hours.  Traders are taking another look at call options at the $100,000 strike expiring in September and December, indicating a bullish outlook.  Bitcoin failed to break above $70,000 on Monday and has since retreated to under $64,500.

We analyze Banking, Brokerage, Crypto, and Payments. This survey and research focus on the emerging Crypto space. Despite the common perception that Gen-Z ""loves"" crypto, our research had some surprising results. Manole Capital Management 7th Annual Gen-Z Survey: Crypto July 2024 Introduction: Manole Capital Management is a boutique asset manager based in Tampa, FL, exclusively concentrating on the emerging Fintech industry. For the last five years, Manole Capital has asked its interns to research the Gen-Z demographic. Manole Capital's goal with this research is to better understand the Gen-Z financial services perspective. We inquire about current opinions, perspectives, and trends in four key financial services: digital currencies, brokerage, banking, and the payments industry. Past survey notes can be viewed by clicking on the link . 2024 Interns: This year, our crypto team includes 8 members from different universities and colleges. Thanks to all the efforts contributed by: Thien Truong (DePauw University), Obiora Ejiofor (York University), Laiba Fatima (McMaster University), Shaurin Chowdhury (UNC-Chapel Hill), Kritik V Kukreja (Shri Ram College of Commerce), Christian Mac Lean (Bentley University), Aditya Upadhyay (UNC-Chapel Hill), and Cole Granese (University of Florida). Generations: The Silent Generation was born before 1945 Baby Boomers were born from 1946 to 1964 Gen-X was born between 1965 and 1980 Millennials were born between 1981 and 1996 The Gen-Z cohort was born from 1997 to 2012 We need to describe the characteristics of each generation, especially focusing on Gen-Z, to better understand the differences among generations. Baby Boomers are often characterized as optimistic, idealistic, self-driven, and tend to be loyal to one company (average tenure is 15 years). Early exposure to technology necessitates daily adaption to current advancements. After years of climbing the corporate ladder, many are now interested in retirement and sharing their legacy. Gen-X tends to be somewhat sceptical, pessimistic, independent, and focused on maintaining a solid work/life balance. This group is often described as resourceful, stemming from hardships in childhood; some had two working parents, and others were raised by single or divorced parents. Millennials are successful and driven, but some have become too dependent on technology, causing their interpersonal skills to suffer. Gen-X individuals, who sometimes view parenthood as a partnership, raised Millennials with more leeway and leniency, which led to a degree of selfishness and a desire to have everything without much effort in return. Gen-Z is less concerned about brands, labels, or corporate names. They are entrepreneurial, ethnically diverse, socially tolerant, and environmentally aware. They are idealistic and focused on advancement with fairness. However, in terms of loyalty to companies, Gen-Z tends to jump between jobs frequently, with 65% quitting their job within a year of employment (2022 Lever Great Resignation). We targeted Gen-Z (those who were born after 1997) and Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) to better understand America's younger generations. Millennials and Gen-Z each make up over 20% of the US population. Understanding these younger generations is crucial, especially since Millennials have surpassed Baby Boomers as the largest living adult generation (according to the US Census Bureau). Often called the ""Internet Generation,"" this younger generation does not know life without an iPhone or social connectivity. They seek truth, value individual expression, and avoid labels. Our Research We summarized the questions we asked and the information we received below. In the survey, we got 274 respondents, out of which 76.3% were males and 23.4% were women. In terms of countries, we got 80.5% from the U.S. and 19.5% from the rest of the world. Given the diversity in sex and geography, we hope this research can provide more comprehensive insights into Gen-Z. Where possible, we have provided our conclusions, takeaways, and opinions. We intend to present Gen-Z and Millennial perspectives, even though some may be controversial. Additionally, it is fascinating to note how certain answers have changed over the last couple of years. Moreover, young people play a critical role in society, creating and shaping our future. Older generations may believe these differences are unconventional and progressive, but understanding different perspectives is critical to adapting to change. By researching the way younger generations think and act, we can provide insight into what the future may hold. We hope you find our research insightful into America's younger generations. Before we dived into our survey, we thought it might be helpful to provide a basic working knowledge of our subject matter. We wanted to include some fundamental insights and thoughts on currency versus digital currencies, given the widely misunderstood nature of this innovative technology and asset class. What is the Deal with Crypto? Although some digital currencies have existed for over a decade, they became widely popular in 2017. Over the past couple of years, cryptocurrency (especially Bitcoin) has surged to the forefront of a larger financial debate: Is digital currency a viable currency? Both sides of this argument are equally bold, voicing both support and discreditation. Are digital currencies a legitimate form of currency? Can we use them as a medium of exchange for goods and services? Let us start with a few simple definitions, according to Webster's Dictionary, to help set an elementary framework. What is Money, Currency, and Digital Currency? Webster defines money as ""something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment"" and defines currency as ""circulation as a medium of exchange."" Traditionally, government agencies create, distribute, and back this currency to prevent inflation and depreciation. Lastly, digital currency is ""any form of currency that only exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulatory authority but instead uses a decentralized system to record transactions and manage the issuance of new units."" Cryptocurrencies substitute computational power and encryption for those traditional governmental guarantees. In addition, it creates a currency system that is decentralized and widely accessible, yet extremely unregulated and volatile. We believe that the simplest way to consider something a viable currency is if it can accomplish two distinct purposes. The first purpose of a currency is that it needs to function as a medium of exchange. Can you walk into a store or go online and transact in this currency to exchange goods and services? At this point, we do not believe that digital currencies are a viable method to exchange goods. We cannot identify many retailers or merchants that would accept our digital currencies in exchange for goods and services. While this might change over time, it does not seem to meet rule number one. The second key characteristic to be considered a viable currency is that it can act as a ""store of value."" Volatility determines an important aspect of being a store of value. If an asset is highly volatile, many investors will deem it too unpredictable to be considered a store of value. For example, dating back thousands of years, gold has been a widely accepted item due to its ability to maintain its value. Question #1: Do you think that crypto is used more for illegal activity? In our research, we aimed to understand if Gen-Z perceived cryptocurrency as being used more for illegal activity. We asked this question in the 2020 survey to see if there had been any changes over the previous four years. This year, most of the Gen-Z respondents (53%) still believe that crypto is used for illegal activity. However, this is less compared to Manole Capital Management's 2020 crypto survey, where 59% of Gen-Z respondents believed the use of cryptocurrency was for illegal activity. We could attribute the decrease in percentage to the increasing knowledge about crypto over the years. However, we expected that the percentage for ""yes"" would have decreased more (over the past 4 years). Manole Capital graph Given the recent collapse of FTX and the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried, the ""illegal perception"" about crypto is understandable. However, instances of fraud only account for 0.34% of crypto transactions. The US government is beginning to embrace crypto, recently approving Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs and the FIT21 bill. This bill aims to strengthen crypto market regulations, boosting investor confidence in crypto assets. The new FIT21 bill, which will create new crypto safeguards, may reassure Gen-Z members who believe crypto is dangerous. This bill should increase the number of people using crypto while creating a safer environment for those new to crypto. The US government has also lifted laws that made it difficult for banks to hold digital assets, which could open the floodgate for billions of dollars in crypto transactions. As time goes on, the negative perception of crypto will likely lessen, as government and regulatory bodies continue to adapt to financial markets. It's time to embrace crypto as an opportunity rather than the perception that it is somehow illegal. Question #2: How knowledgeable are you on crypto? Manole Capital graph In the 2020 survey, we only evaluated the correspondent's interest in the subject. This year, we wanted to assess the level of familiarity our survey participants had with the subject. It is noteworthy that most respondents indicate a limited understanding of crypto (51%). However, the definition of ""limited"" varies widely among respondents, complicating our analysis. The fact that 64% of participants perceive themselves as having little to no knowledge about crypto is interesting, considering its growing prominence in the financial landscape. We were surprised that the smallest group, only 6%, consider themselves truly knowledgeable about crypto. Clearly, there's a lot more Gen-Z can learn on this topic. How do these results compare to our past surveys? Well…the 2020 survey indicated that 67% of the respondents had no interest in crypto. As one would expect, the fewer people interested in this topic, the less they will seek to understand. Only interest can lead to the acquisition of knowledge. As legislation gets passed and the price of certain digital currencies rise, we expect Gen-Z will begin to take notice. In our survey next year and the year after, we anticipate that 6% will significantly grow. Question #3: Do you think crypto is riskier than investing in stocks? We didn't ask the same question in the 2020 survey; however, this question can shed light on a similar insight from that survey. We asked if Gen-Z believed that crypto was riskier than investing in stocks. Manole Capital graph In this year's survey, 86% of respondents believe that cryptocurrencies are riskier than equities. The reasoning behind this attitude is not surprising, as cryptocurrencies are indeed far more volatile than stocks. Market sentiment, macroeconomic events, regulatory developments, and other factors contribute to this volatility. Moreover, unlike stocks that derive their fundamental worth from a company's earnings, cryptocurrencies lack a fundamental worth. Instead, crypto derives its value from investor trust, FOMO (fear of missing out), and in some cases, ""store of value"". Without a true way to evaluate the fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrencies, they naturally should have higher volatility and risk. Also, as compared to stocks, cryptocurrencies are a relatively new asset class. Dating back only to 2009, cryptocurrencies made their debut as an open-source software. Stocks, on the other hand, have more data and history. Investors have been conducting research and analysis on public companies since the 1600s. Question #4: When merchants accept, will crypto? Manole Capital graph In another part of our survey, we asked respondents about their thoughts on when cryptocurrencies would become widely accepted by retailers and merchants. 45% of respondents predicted this would happen within the next 5 to 10 years, while 27% believe that crypto will never gain acceptance. Only 4% of our survey believed that merchants would shortly begin to accept crypto at the POS (point of sale). Interestingly, 27% said ""never"". In our opinion, this reasoning is sound. As the previous few questions highlight, Gen-Z does not see a clear path for cryptocurrencies to be used and seamlessly integrated into everyday life. Despite this lack of knowledge and confidence in crypto, Gen-Z is optimistic that ultimately it will be accepted by retailers - it's just a matter of time. When comparing this to the study from 2020, opinions have changed. In 2020, the highest response group was ""never,"" with an overwhelming 49%. Now, most people believe that 5-10 years is the correct response. The confidence in the 5 to 10-year timeframe stems from a blend of skepticism about the current complexities of crypto; such as regulatory uncertainties and price volatility, as well as a belief that technological advancements and increasing adoption will gradually improve. In our opinion, Gen-Z views the rise of platforms like Coinbase and the growing utilization of blockchain technologies as crucial steps towards legitimizing cryptocurrencies, as a viable alternative to today's more traditional financial system. Gen-Z views these developments as establishing the foundation for broader acceptance and additional applications in our daily lives. Question #5: Do you own crypto? If yes, which crypto(s) do you own? Manole Capital graph In our recent survey assessing crypto ownership and interest levels among Gen-Z, a clear trend emerged; a significant majority expressed no interest in owning cryptocurrencies (45%). This group of respondents cited reasons ranging from a lack of understanding about cryptocurrencies to simply not being interested in the concept. Among the remaining respondents, 55% showed some level of interest in cryptocurrencies. These findings underscore a prevailing sentiment that, while awareness of cryptocurrencies exists, widespread enthusiasm and adoption are not yet pervasive. Platforms like Coinbase are contributing to the increasing visibility and accessibility of crypto, potentially paving the way for greater adoption among Gen-Z and other tech-savvy demographics. As these platforms continue to evolve and crypto gains more mainstream recognition, it is plausible that interest and participation levels will continue to increase, especially among younger, more digitally native generations. When comparing this to the survey from 2020, the results are quite different. In 2020, those who owned crypto were about 7%, and now it is 26%, highlighting a drastic increase over the last four years. The ""no and not interested"" group changed significantly from 56% down to 45%, indicating interest in crypto has been increasing. Overall, while a significant portion of the population remains uninterested or uninformed about crypto, the landscape appears poised for growth. Manole Capital graph According to the survey, 77% of Gen-Z own Bitcoin, while 57% own Ethereum. Our survey found that Gen-Z also owns some other digital assets, like Shiba Inu, Decentraland, SOL, Polygon, and others. Clearly, the Big 2 cryptos to own are Bitcoin and Ethereum. We can see that many of the Gen-Z population believe that Bitcoin is a strong investment and has a brighter future compared to various other cryptos. In the 2020 survey, Bitcoin ownership was just at 31%, so it is clearly the #1 crypto for Gen-Z to own. Ethereum is still #2, and it has also materially increased, from just 20% in 2020 to 57% now. Ethereum ETFs just launched, so it should continue to grow in acceptance. Question #6: What is your preferred crypto platform? If you are a crypto owner, tracking and trading your currency can be a very challenging process. Unlike usual securities, most of these currencies require a digital wallet to keep track of transactions. This is because, as odd as it may seem, these digital wallets don't hold any currency. Cryptocurrencies don't physically exist anywhere. Digital wallets allow users to keep track of their currency inflows and outflows, effectively eliminating the need to store any physical currency. There's an ever-growing number of these services, allowing users access to the ledger and the ability to trade. However, the management of many digital wallets by third-party companies presents a unique security risk. Manole Capital graph We wanted to understand what the preferred platform of Gen-Z. This year, in total, we received 17 different preferred crypto platforms. With the largest market share at 61%, the clear leader was Coinbase. Our research found that Coinbase is succeeding in the marketplace because of its user-friendly interface and strong security features. Following Coinbase, PayPal is in 2nd place, with a 16% market share. We believe this is because PayPal has successfully integrated crypto transactions into its payment platform. Some other platforms, such as Binance, Kraken, and Coinsquare, have a smaller but notable presence. This indicated a diversified interest in various platforms, suggesting that while some users prefer mainstream options, others are exploring different options for their digital coin transactions. When comparing this year's results to the 2020 survey, we found some similarities and some differences. Coinbase was the dominant platform in 2020, and it remains so today. However, the biggest jump was PayPal, which wasn't even one of the options 4 years ago. Now, PayPal is in 2nd place. The biggest surprise and change from 2020 was Binance. It used to have a 19% market share in Gen-Z, however now it only received 4 votes. Wow! Talk about a fall… This is most likely associated to additional and heightened security from US authorities. On October 18th, 2023, Binance US announced that they wouldn't allow withdrawals for users and that its users could not withdraw USD without first converting it to stable coins or another digital asset. Also surprising to us was FTX still being on this list. With its founder behind bars and disgraced, we were surprised it received any votes. Question #7: What is the best attribute of crypto? Unlike the 2020 survey, this is the first time we've posed this question. We wanted to better understand and gain a deeper understanding of Gen-Z's perspective and understanding of crypto. Our results found that the top four attributes of crypto were: Its decentralized nature, speed, competition with the US dollar, and anonymous transactions. Gen-Z believes that crypto's best trait is its decentralized nature, at 40%. This refers to the blockchain and how crypto operates without intermediaries or governmental oversight. Investors value this autonomy, especially where their actions are free from unwanted scrutiny. Gen-Z views crypto's competition with the US dollar, at 16%, as the least significant attribute, but the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th choices were all fairly similar. Unlike industries such as manufacturing, technology, and services, crypto contributes less to our nation's GDP. Industries like energy, agriculture, manufacturing, and technology typically have a more substantial direct economic impact compared to crypto. Meanwhile, the speed factor and anonymous transactions contribute around the same amount (23% and 21%, respectively). Manole Capital graph Using blockchain technology has helped with transparent and fast transactions, but lacking government interventions and regulations can pose a security risk. For instance, in 2016, the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) made an early attempt to create a decentralized venture capital fund on the Ethereum blockchain. An exploit in its smart contract code led to the theft of approximately $60 million worth of Ether. This is just one example, and there are undoubtedly many more occurring. We were quite surprised by these results, as we would have thought that Gen-Z's preference for convenience and privacy protection would be the best attributes of crypto. Gen-Z values these in almost every aspect of our lives (indicated through the increasing use of e-wallets or internet banking services), so we were surprised to see decentralized nature take the #1 slot. Question #8: Should the government regulate crypto? Manole Capital graph We didn't ask this exact question in the 2020 survey, but we did have a question that provided a similar insight. We wanted to change the wording to better match today's financial landscape. The majority of Gen-Z, at 61%, believes that the government should regulate crypto. In our opinion, there is a clear correlation among these data points. We believe that regulations will allow for a safer and more secure marketplace. This will then boost confidence and provide a broader range of investment opportunities. Crypto relies on unregulated trust, Gen-Z must believe that additional regulations will reduce the possibility of consumer harm. Crypto service providers do not have regulatory exemptions when they offer services. The crypto marketplace is a volatile system, and it is relatively harder to detect fraudulent activity and ensure accountability. The crypto marketplace is ironically referred to as the ""Wild West"" due to this instability, lack of regulatory supervision, and high risks. In comparison, if there is non-governmental regulation, there will be exponentially more prospects of innovation, financial sovereignty, privacy, and freedoms. Crypto users crave flexibility and privacy; if there are more governmental regulations, it would result in more monitoring and surveillance, and likely push users overseas. The Catch-22 is that innovation can be hindered by overregulation. Question #9: Do you think countries are using crypto to avoid sanctions? Manole Capital graph This is the first time we have asked this question. We asked if countries were using crypto to avoid sanctions (hinting at Russia, Iran, and North Korea). This question assumed a certain amount of knowledge about crypto to answer, which an earlier question indicated wasn't there. The majority (52%) of respondents are unaware of the use of crypto for evading sanctions, while approximately 42% believe crypto is used to avoid sanctions. This result is not surprising, since most people don't understand what sanctions are, or the relationship between them and crypto transactions. Let's delve into the topic of sanctions and how crypto could be used to avoid them. Sanctions are political and economic decisions taken by countries or international organizations to penalize a specific country, organization, or individual. There are many types of sanctions, ranging from economic sanctions (restrictions on trade, investment, or financial transactions) to diplomatic sanctions (travel bans on diplomats) and a lot more. The US, UN, and European Union impose sanctions on North Korea to deter nuclear weapons development, making it a notable example of sanctions. Behind the scenes, people engage in activities like sanction evasion. Many media and news organizations do not cover these activities. However, there have been indications in the past that crypto is being used to dodge sanctions. For example, after the Russian-Ukraine war, trading volumes between the rouble and Bitcoin and the rouble and Tether skyrocketed (following Western sanctions). Furthermore, crypto transactions are exceedingly difficult to track, making it challenging to identify whether it is being used to escape sanctions or for a lawful reason. Just a few weeks ago, a new Senate bill contained a provision designed to prevent the use of crypto for supporting terrorism. This suggests a worry about the use of digital assets to evade financial controls, including sanctions. Countering this, the crypto industry is pushing back on the requirement to identify users, ensuring its ability to remain anonymous. Staying topical, the Russian government just passed a bill (on Tuesday, July 30th) that allows businesses to use digital currencies in international trade. This is a larger component of how governments are skirting Western sanctions with crypto. Question #10: Do you think cryptocurrencies contribute to creating economic value? The money that most people use around the world today has no intrinsic value. Indeed, the money in your hand is worthless! People use fiat money, a government-issued currency, that lacks a commodity backing (like gold). It is not incorrect to assert that the value of the money in your possession simply stems from people's perception of its worth. Without the supply and demand of fiat money, and the backing of individual governments, currency is no different than crypto. Smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, Solana, and Near generate fee revenue from the economic activity on their networks. Network fee revenue is the total amount of fees paid by users to use the network. It is a critical indicator of the value that these platforms generate. Importantly, there is a close relationship between the network fee revenue and the market cap. This means that as more users engage with these networks and create fees, the market capitalization of the corresponding cryptocurrencies tends to increase. Manole Capital graph This is the first time we asked this question. We wanted to know if crypto was creating economic value. Our goal was to understand if Gen-Z perceived crypto as valuable to our economy. Gen-Z knowledge of crypto has not improved, so it wasn't likely to believe it continues to our economy. According to the results, around 83% voted that the importance of crypto on the economy should be equal to or lower than 3. Only a quarter of Gen-Z believe that crypto is creating value. We weren't terribly surprised by this answer, as most Gen-Z view crypto like gambling. In addition, many believe crypto has no intrinsic value, so wouldn't view it as a terrible additive. It doesn't help that the media frequently portrays crypto as a fraud, which intensifies this perception. Lastly, Gen-Z gets information from social media, which sometimes lacks critical thinking skills. All of this demonstrates that network activity has a direct financial impact and generates value. Crypto can act as a better alternative to money because of faster transactions, complete decentralization, lower transaction costs, transparency, and so on. The rapid growth in the number of users and the size of the market has demonstrated the advantages of using crypto over an extended period. Conclusion: Manole Capital defines Fintech as "" anything utilizing technology to improve an established process. "" It also states that the crypto industry is the most thriving FINTECH industry in the world, as crypto coins such as Bitcoin are at all-time highs and stakeholders accept them as a form of payment. The cryptocurrency sector is fast changing and experiencing substantial developments. Some of our major Gen-Z findings are: crypto is still perceived to be used for illegal operations. there remains a lack of understanding and knowledge. crypto remains a risky asset class, much riskier than stocks. merchants are unlikely to accept crypto at the POS (point of sale). Bitcoin and Ethereum are still the most prominent digital currencies. Coinbase remains the dominant digital currency platform. decentralization is the most significant aspect and trait of crypto. a desire for increased government regulation. In our opinion: We feel that crypto is a valuable and growing asset class, but it is also far more volatile and riskier than other asset classes. Attributes such as decentralization and anonymous transactions appeal to Gen-Z, but it wants additional government regulations. Garry Kasparov, the world's greatest chess player, famously stated, ""If you don't take risks, you'll never be able to create something truly worthwhile."" This is also true for crypto, if individuals avoid using it due to risk of losing their money. However, they also run the risk of missing out on one of the most innovative and unique asset classes. We hope that our survey and research will provide you with greater insight into Gen-Z's perspectives, trends, and thoughts on crypto. Thank you for your interest in our Gen-Z cryptocurrency note. We'd love to hear from you and receive your feedback on our research, regardless of whether you agree or disagree with any of the findings. Have a wonderful summer.

31786964,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632649,1722511844,"Analyst Says Solana Will Go Ballistic  In The ‘Mania-Like Stage”, Targets $600","Solana is one of the top performers in the top 10, looking at the performance over the last year of trading. After plunging to around $8 after the collapse of FTX, prices went on to recover steadily throughout 2023 before rising to as high as $210 in March 2024. Is SOL Ready For The “Mania-Like Stage”? While SOL prices are cooling off at spot rates, retracting from this week’s highs, some analysts are confident. Taking to X, one analyst believes the coin is within a breakout formation after clearing above a re-accumulation structure. For what’s there, SOL, the analyst added, is “ripe to push higher.” Related Reading: Bitwise CIO On Bitcoin: ‘We’re Not Bullish Enough’ – Here’s Why If bulls flow back, reversing recent weakness, Solana could easily glide higher, entering what the analyst described as a “mania-like stage.” Looking at the SOL candlestick arrangement, the analyst predicts that SOL will rip higher, breaking above the all-time highs of around $260 recorded in 2021. Afterwards, the coin is highly likely to scale out aggressively. By the trader’s estimation, Solana can quickly rally to as high as $600 if buyers take over. Still, only time will tell whether Solana Bulls have what it takes. From the SOLUSDT chart, the coin gained nearly 40% after sinking to as low as $122 in July 2024. There is a double top at around $190, though more obstacles lie at around the $200 to $210 resistance zone. Technically, SOL is within a bullish formation. If prices stay above $160, the resulting momentum could propel the coin above the immediate liquidation zone, spurring more demand. Solana Finds Rapid Adoption, Flips Ethereum In Key Metrics Possible drivers would be fundamental factors, especially in the adoption and regulatory development fronts.

A similar reading preceded Bitcoin's late 2023 surge.  Traders bored of bitcoin {{BTC}}'s range-ridden days might want to return to their computer screens. An indicator called ""Bollinger bandwidth"" that successfully predicted the late 2023 volatility boom is glowing brightly again.  Bollinger bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day/week simple moving average of an asset's price. The bandwidth, an unbound oscillator, is derived by dividing the spread between the volatility bands by the 20-period SMA.  Bitcoin's Bollinger bandwidth has declined to 20% on the weekly chart, a level last seen days before BTC exited its then multi-month trading range of $25,000 to $32,000 in late October. Prices topped the $40,000 mark by year-end and rose to record highs above $70,000 in March this year.  The latest reading of 20% follows four months of trading between $60,000 and $70,000, barring occasional brief dips to $55,000.  The bandwidth flashed a similar reading ahead of the volatility explosions in November 2018, October 2016, mid-105 and mid-2012, as CoinDesk discussed in October.  Volatility is said to be mean-reverting. So, a narrower bandwidth, representing price stability, often precedes a breakout in either direction or burst of volatility. On the flip side, high bandwidth indicates a cooling period on the horizon.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/01/bitcoin-indicator-that-forewarned-late-2023-volatility-explosion-is-lighting-up-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20e9ca82b7d73729f47fe595661344b3e8a5eadd-1280x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31787014,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=23938,1722509600,What is Turbo (TURBO)?,"Turbo AI memecoin, known as Turbo Token, is a unique project born from a creative experiment in the cryptocurrency space. Unlike traditional crypto ventures, Turbo Token was conceptualised and guided by the AI language model GPT-4, starting with a modest budget of just $69. This community-driven initiative operates on the principles of decentralisation, with no taxes on transactions and a fully renounced contract, ensuring that no single entity has control over the token. The entire supply of 69 billion tokens is in circulation, with 60 billion crowdfunded and 9 billion allocated to the founder, reflecting a commitment to transparency and fairness. The project’s foundation lies in its technological framework as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This setup provides secure, transparent, and efficient transactions without central authority. The absence of a central team and the reliance on a community-driven roadmap allow Turbo Token to adapt swiftly to the dynamic digital art world. This flexible approach not only embraces new trends but also fosters inclusivity, ensuring that the token’s development aligns with the community’s interests and passions. The collective creativity of the community is a vital source of innovation, driving the project towards unexplored areas with confidence. Turbo Token’s journey has already seen notable achievements under this community-driven model. The project has gained significant market cap growth, secured listings on numerous exchanges, and cultivated a vibrant community of artists and digital art enthusiasts. Initiatives like the art open call and expansion into platforms such as SX Bet highlight the project’s commitment to exploring new opportunities and enhancing its ecosystem. These milestones underscore the project’s ability to thrive without a formal roadmap, relying instead on the organic input and direction from its supporters. Turbo Token stands out in the crowded meme coin market by prioritising decentralisation, simplicity, and community engagement. The project’s AI-driven inception and community-centric approach create a unique identity that resonates with the values of fairness and inclusivity. As Turbo Token continues to grow and evolve, it aims to build a sustainable and innovative ecosystem, offering long-term value to its holders and paving the way for future developments in the cryptocurrency space. Trade Turbo now What is the TURBO Token? The TURBO token is an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that operates on the Ethereum blockchain, serving as the native currency within the Turbo ecosystem. Originally conceived as an experimental meme coin, TURBO has evolved into a community-driven digital asset with a total supply of 69 billion tokens. What sets TURBO apart is its foundation in artificial intelligence, specifically guided by the GPT-4 model, which influenced its creation and development. The token’s smart contract is renounced, meaning no central authority can alter its core functionalities, ensuring a fully decentralised and fair distribution. This unique aspect not only enhances security but also fosters a trustless environment for all participants. Within the Turbo ecosystem, TURBO token serves multiple use cases, primarily centred around community engagement and decentralised decision-making. As the project thrives on the input and creativity of its community, TURBO tokens are used as a medium of exchange and a voting tool for various initiatives and proposals. This participatory model allows token holders to influence the direction of the ecosystem, from funding new projects to deciding on partnerships and collaborations. The token’s design, which includes no transaction taxes, encourages active trading and interaction within the community, making it accessible and appealing to a broad audience. The TURBO token also plays a crucial role in the ecosystem’s artistic and digital content initiatives. The project has attracted a diverse group of artists and digital creators, who utilise TURBO as a medium for buying, selling, and auctioning digital art and collectibles. This not only creates a vibrant marketplace for creative works but also provides a platform for artists to reach a wider audience within the crypto space. Moreover, the token’s integration into platforms like SX Bet opens up additional use cases, such as betting and gaming, further diversifying its applications and appeal. The TURBO token is more than just a meme coin; it is the backbone of a decentralised, community-oriented ecosystem that emphasises inclusivity, creativity, and innovation. By leveraging the unique capabilities of blockchain technology and the guidance of artificial intelligence, TURBO has positioned itself as a pioneering project within the cryptocurrency market. Its use cases extend beyond simple transactions, encompassing governance, digital art, and decentralised applications, making it a versatile and valuable asset for its holders. As the Turbo ecosystem continues to grow, the TURBO token will likely play an even more integral role in facilitating new and exciting developments.

The initiative is part of a broader trend in the crypto industry, where tangible real-world assets and traditional financial securities are being tokenized, enhancing efficiency and attracting major participants like BlackRock.  Payments network Ripple will allocate $10 million to a tokenized version of U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills) that will become available on the XRP Ledger for the first time.  The short-term U.S. government debt is being issued as TBILL tokens by the tokenization platform OpenEden, according to a Thursday release.  Assets backing the tokens will be invested in short-dated U.S. Treasuries and reverse repurchase agreements (repos) collateralized by U.S. Treasuries. Repos are securities sold with an agreement to repurchase them at a higher price at a specified future date.  The tokenization of tangible real-world assets and traditional financial securities is a growing sector of the crypto industry. It allows traditional assets, especially private and alternative assets, to be issued, managed, and distributed in a way that is considered more efficient than their off-chain counterparts.  There are big players involved. In March, BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager by assets under management, released its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund on the Ethereum blockchain, backing it with U.S. Treasury bills, repo agreements and cash.  Ripple's allocation is part of a larger fund the company will allocate to tokenized T-bills provided by OpenEden and other unspecified issuers. Neither OpenEden nor Ripple Labs specified dates for the fund's allocation in the release.  XRP Ledger (XRPL) is an open-source blockchain that uses the cryptocurrency XRP to facilitate global financial transfers and currency exchanges.

Interestingly, these ultra-bullish predictions align with some predictions made by financial institutions. Ethereum To Rise To $50,000 Ethereum maximalist Adriano Feria predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Ethereum could reach $50,000 in this market cycle. He made this bold prediction in response to Ethereum developer Eric Conner’s prediction that ETH will reach $35,000 this cycle. Conner had initially predicted that ETH would rise above $20,000 in this bull run but eventually revised his price target because of the “ETH hate” he was receiving following his prediction. Related Reading: This PEPE Holder Cohort Is The Reason Price Is Struggling To Reclaim $0.00002 Meanwhile, Feria followed Conner’s footsteps and upped his ETH price target, predicting the crypto token to reach $100,000. He explained that the hate ETH was getting made him realize that “99% of the people in the world are completely sidelined, and institutions have barely gotten their feet wet.” Feria added that those holding ETH are truly the “world’s elite” because ETH’s bull case should send the crypto token to $100,000. The analyst suggested that Ethereum has yet to enjoy mainstream adoption, and it could send its price to the $100,000 target when that happens. This includes the entry of institutional investors into the Ethereum ecosystem, which is already happening thanks to the Spot Ethereum ETFs. Feria is also confident in his prediction and remarked that he wasn’t joking. He noted that some financial institutions have come up with bull targets close to his price target of $100,000. One of the financial institutions that the analyst might have been referring to includes VanEck, which gave a bull case price target of $154,000 for ETH by 2030. Why ETH Rising To $50,000 Is Possible Crypto investor Jesse Eckel recently made a bullish case for Ethereum, explaining why Ethereum will not only reach but surpass the $50,000 price target. He alluded to VanEck’s prediction that Bitcoin can reach $52 million by 2050. He claimed that ETH is “objectively better money than BTC, ” meaning that the former could easily attain unprecedented heights since VanEck predicts that the flagship crypto will be worth millions of dollars. Related Reading: Hedge Fund Manager Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $428,000 If This Happens Eckel further remarked that Ethereum is currently the “backbone” of onchain finance. He claimed that ETH would “continue to grow as a legitimate form of money” as everything becomes tokenized and trillions of dollars move onchain. The investors also noted how almost every layer-2 network launches under the Ethereum ecosystem. With such massive adoption on the horizon for ETH, Eckel predicts that Ethereum can even rise to as high as $23 million based on VanEck’s prediction for Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,170, down over 4%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The bitcoin ""halving"", which cuts the reward miners receive for adding new blocks to the network, lower number of bitcoin that Riot produced during the quarter.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} mining firm Riot Platforms (RIOT) said its second-quarter loss trebled from the year before as general running costs climbed 48%.  The Castle Rock, Colo.-based company posted a net loss of $84.4 million, or $0.32 per share. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose to $61.2 million. More than half the figure, $32.1 million, comprised stock compensation expenses related to new grants under a long-term incentive program. The net loss for the quarter also included a $76.4 million drop in the fair value of bitcoin it holds.  April's Bitcoin halving, which cuts the reward miners receive for adding new blocks to the blockchain by 50%, reduced the number of bitcoin Riot produced during the quarter. The company mined 844 BTC, 52% less than in the previous second quarter.  The cost to mine the bitcoin jumped to $25,327 from $5,734 due to a 68% increase in the network's hashrate. Hashrate is a measurement of the total computational power used to process transactions on the network.

The most expensive range has already sold out, and is being relisted at five times that price on eBay.  U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump made his support for bitcoin {{BTC}} clear when he addressed more than 3,000 Bitcoin Conference attendees on Saturday. Now he's selling shoes to reiterate the message.  Trump Sneakers, a Trump-owned website that sells themed footwear and perfumes, earlier this week started listing a range of limited edition sneakers including a Bitcoin-themed, high-top version that costs $499 a pair on pre-order. There are just 1,000 pairs of the bright orange version, and they've already sold out.  “These exclusive sneakers celebrate the future of finance and the leadership of President Trump, boldly emblazoned with a prominent Bitcoin symbol,” a descriptor for the product reads. “Perfect for crypto enthusiasts and Trump supporters alike, these limited-edition shoes are a must-have.”  Another 1,000 pairs of low-top sneakers in bright orange and 1,000 in black are listed for $299. Orange is a color associated with support for the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap. High-tops and low-tops describe where the shoes reach on the wearer's ankle.  The high-top, bright orange range had sold out by Thursday morning. Some pre-order purchases are already being advertised on eBay for as high as $2,500.  The Trump Sneakers website is owned by CIC Ventures LLC, a company that Trump declared fully owned on his 2023 financial disclosure. The site mentions it has nothing to do with Trump’s political campaign and says the sneakers are not designed, sold or manufactured by Trump or related associates.  The Bitcoin sneaker went live on the site shortly after Trump's speech at the conference in Nashville. In it, he promised to fire SEC head Gary Gensler and create a strategic bitcoin reserve if elected.

31786315,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632601,1722501034,Bitwise CIO On Bitcoin: ‘We’re Not Bullish Enough’ – Here’s Why,"Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Bitwise, claims in a new memo to investors following the 2024 Bitcoin Conference that the market may not be bullish enough about the future of BTC. The conference was a watershed moment that attracted massive political attention and could influence the future trajectory of Bitcoin heavily. Why You Are Not Bullish Enough On Bitcoin The conference featured a number of groundbreaking statements from high-profile political figures. First and foremost, GOP’s presidential candidate Donald Trump’s statement about building a national Bitcoin reserve caused huge waves. Trump articulated a vision of America as the “crypto capital of the world” and proposed the establishment of a “strategic Bitcoin stockpile”. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) presented a bill that would require the US Treasury Department to procure 1 million Bitcoin. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) called on the Democratic Party to move away from previous restrictive policies and embrace cryptocurrencies as an integral part of the US financial system. Related Reading: Research Firm Predicts Bitcoin Game Theory In Global Adoption Race In an even more ambitious call, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested that the US Treasury should acquire 4 million Bitcoin. This figure is intended to be equivalent to the US’s share of the world’s gold reserves. According to Hougan, the political discourse surrounding Bitcoin has rapidly evolved from skepticism to strategic acceptance, a transformation punctuated by recent crises and regulatory challenges. The collapse of FTX in late 2022, which marked one of the most significant upheavals in crypto history, casted a long shadow over the industry. However, as Hougan noted, the resilience of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market has been remarkable. “This is crazy. Less than two years ago, FTX was collapsing in a historic fraud, bitcoin was trading at $17,000, and skeptics were dancing on crypto’s grave. Now politicians are openly talking about building a ‘Bitcoin Fort Knox,’ Hougan writes. Related Reading: Hedge Fund Manager Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $428,000 If This Happens He further points out that less than a year after the SEC’s aggressive action against Coinbase, the US Department of Justice is now cooperating with the same platform to secure its crypto operations, reflecting a broader recalibration of governmental attitudes towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Hougan suggests that these developments are not merely opportunistic but reflect a deeper recognition of cryptocurrencies’ growing influence in American society. “When you say ‘opportunism,’ I say, ‘That’s how politics works,'” Hougan stated, acknowledging the strategic shifts within the US political sphere. The implications for investors, according to Hougan, are profound. Investors need to reassess the potential scale of Bitcoin’s growth. Hougan highlighted the asymmetry in risk perceptions, where the focus has traditionally been on downside possibilities. “We spend a lot of time focused on downside risk However, there is now an equal risk to the upside,” he stated. The sentiment on Wall Street is also seeing a notable shift. In a conversation reported from the conference, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon referred to Bitcoin as a potential store of value, indicating growing interest from major financial institutions. The Bitwise CIO mused, “Could we wake up tomorrow and find out that a G20 country has added bitcoin to its balance sheet, looking to front-run the US? Could comprehensive crypto legislation get passed more quickly than expected in the US as bipartisan support strengthens? Could Wall Street massively embrace crypto, at a scale much larger than most expect? “ Overall, the 2024 Bitcoin Conference has evidently served as a catalyst for rethinking Bitcoin’s role on both national and global stages. “These ideas would have been the stuff of daydreams a year ago. But after what I witnessed last week, they look more likely than not,” Hougan concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $64,136.

Crypto Market Awaits Fed’s Next Move Powell, speaking at a press conference in Washington DC, hinted at the possibility of rate reductions in September, contingent upon the economic performance in the weeks leading up to that month. “We’ve made no decisions about future meetings and that includes the September meeting,” Powell stated. “We’re getting closer to the point at which we’ll reduce our policy rate, but we’re not quite at that point yet.” Related Reading: This PEPE Holder Cohort Is The Reason Price Is Struggling To Reclaim $0.00002 In response to the Fed’s stance, crypto analysts weighed in on the implications for the digital currency space, with Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, expressing optimism over Powell’s “dovish outlook,” suggesting that a September rate cut remains a strong possibility. In his social media post, Van de Poppe expressed confidence that this development bodes well for both Bitcoin and altcoins, with an eye on the upcoming decision expected in September. Similarly, another analyst, Daan Crypto Trades, underscored Powell’s indication of a potential rate cut in September, projecting a high likelihood of its realization unless significant deviations occur following Consumer Price Index (CPI) readings. With 48 days remaining until the September meeting, Daan Crypto Trades proposed that market dynamics may revolve around this impending decision, potentially giving rise to short-term fluctuations after the initial rate adjustment in September. Bitcoin To Hit $1 Million In 2028? In a recent social media post, Timothy Peterson, a Bitcoin writer and researcher, unveiled a significant prediction for the largest cryptocurrency on the market that, if it holds true in time, could result in BTC’s price reaching unprecedented highs. According to Peterson, the Bitcoin price is directly and exponentially proportional to the square root of the number of Halvings that the network has undergone. In other words, the amount of new BTC introduced into circulation is cut in half approximately every four years, a process known as a Halving. “A combination of adoption curve math and Metcalfe’s Law puts Bitcoin’s price well over $500,000 by the next halving in 2028,” Peterson asserted. “This implies an annualized rate of return of about 70%.” Related Reading: XRP Analyst Thinks The Coin Is Ready To Skyrocket By 21,000% To Over $150 Peterson’s prediction is particularly noteworthy given Bitcoin’s current price of around $65,700, as if his prediction proves accurate, it would represent a massive increase of over 670% from current levels. Furthermore, the researcher suggests that Bitcoin should be “sustainably above $1 million” about 450 days after the next halving event in 2028, aligning with the observed pattern of previous Halving cycles, where Bitcoin has tended to experience a significant price surge in the years following each reduction in new supply.

The accumulation was characterized by bargain hunting during the early July price dip.  In a display of confidence, large bitcoin {{BTC}} holders, often adept at timing market moves, boosted their coin stash in July at the fastest pace in years, capitalizing on the two-way price volatility.  Large holders, or addresses owning at least 0.1% of BTC's circulating supply, snapped up over 84K BTC, worth $5.4 billion at the current market price, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock and TradingView. That's the biggest single-month tally in BTC terms since October 2014.  The accumulation was characterized by bargain hunting during the early July price dip to under $55,000 and brief pauses in the subsequent recovery to $69,000. BTC ended July with a meager 3% gain, according to CoinDesk data.  The strategic accumulation likely indicates a strong belief that the prolonged consolidation phase between $50,000 and $70,000 will eventually end with a bullish breakout, extending the initial rally from $16,000.  Analysts are optimistic about bitcoin's price prospects.  ""A rate cut in September, would provide a sense of bullishness and could generally increase liquidity in the market, which will be positive for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as investors seek higher returns outside traditional assets. This could lead to upward pressure on Bitcoin's price and increased ETF inflows as investors look to capitalize on a more favorable environment for risk assets,"" Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex said in an email.  On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that interest rates could be cut as soon as September, emphasizing that the economic data needs to back up the potential renewed liquidity easing. The central bank held its benchmark interest rate steady in the 5.25%-5.50% range, maintaining a status quo as expected.  ""The Fed has been striving for a 'soft landing,' and if the data allows them to cut, and it is certainly moving in that direction relative to their forecasts, then we think they will seize the opportunity. We expect officials to start moving monetary policy from 'restrictive' territory to ""slightly less"" restrictive policy from September with additional cuts in November and December,"" ING said in a daily note to clients.  The bullish sentiment also stems from renewed capital inflows via stablecoins or digital assets with values pegged to external references like the U.S. dollar.  Per CCData, the total market capitalization of stablecoins rose 2.11% to $164 billion in July, the highest since April 2022. ""This is the highest monthly rise in the stablecoins market capitalization since April, suggesting inflows of new capital into the markets as reflected by the positive price action of digital assets in July,"" CCData said in a report shared with CoinDesk.  Kooner said the diminishing impact of negative news is assuring to the bulls.  ""There is a lot of confidence in the market at the moment particularly as even potentially negative news like the Mt. Gox Distribution, German Government selling and a lot of recent significant on Chain movements have not been able to substantially impact the Bitcoin price to the downside,"" Kooner said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/01/large-bitcoin-holders-added-54b-in-btc-in-july-data-show,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8d06df4f8265992f112c26bc18bc3a0b4a323e7-2710x1502.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31784064,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632591,1722492038,Tether Reports Record-Breaking $5.2 Billion Net Profit In Latest 2024 Audit,"Tether, one of the largest crypto companies in the industry and issuer of the most widely used stablecoin USDT, has released its attestation report for the first half of the year, recording substantial gains that amount to nearly $1 billion per month. Transition To US Treasuries Pays Off According to the report, independently audited by accounting firm BDO, Tether’s net operating profit for the second quarter of 2024 reached a new high of $1.3 billion, propelling the company’s total net profit for the first half of the year to over $5 billion. According to the stablecoin issuer, the foundation of Tether’s financial growth and stability comes from an income base derived from investments in US Treasury Bills (T-Bills), which was first implemented after eliminating commercial paper from its stablecoin reserves and replacing it with US T-Bills in 2022. Related Reading: XRP Analyst Thinks The Coin Is Ready To Skyrocket By 21,000% To Over $150 The report also revealed that in the second quarter of the year, direct and indirect ownership of US Treasuries within Tether’s token reserves made notable progress, surpassing $97.6 billion, resulting in a historic high in this metric. This brings Tether’s exposure to Treasuries across multiple countries, positioning it as the 18th largest holder of US debt globally and the 3rd largest purchaser of 3-month US Treasuries after the UK and the Cayman Islands. Despite fluctuations in Bitcoin (BTC) prices, which reached an all-time high of $73,700 in March, the report noted that consolidated equity increased by $520 million in the second quarter, with gold’s positive performance compensating for the losses. The company revealed that its consolidated net equity as of June 30 was $11.9 billion. Tether Commits Profits To Ecosystem Expansion According to the financial disclosures, as of June 30, 2024, Tether’s reserves for circulating tokens totaled $118 billion, exceeding debt by $5.3 billion. In a strategic move, the firm also revealed that a portion of the second quarter’s profits is going to be reinvested in “pivotal projects” to bolster Tether’s ecosystem, while a substantial excess reserve of $5.3 billion was maintained to fortify token stability. Investments in sustainable energy, Bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, telecommunications technology, neurotechnology, education and other long-term ventures were also part of the firm’s portfolio. Related Reading: Elliot Wave Theory Suggests Bitcoin Price Will Crash Below $40,000 Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, took to social media to celebrate the company’s growth and profitability recorded in the first half of the year, saying: Finally, we realize that our company grew and reached new, almost unimaginable, levels. It’s truly humbling to find ourselves in the position to build everything our imagination could dream. That’s why, for us, Tether is a Once-In-One-Hundred-Year Opportunity. And being a private company allows us to focus on the things that truly matter.

Ethereum And Tether Both Have Seen Withdrawals From Exchanges Recently As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment in a new post on X, the market is ending July on a mixed note in terms of the exchange flows. The metric of interest here is the “Exchange Flow Balance,” which measures the net amount of a given asset that’s entering into or exiting the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the inflows to these platforms are outweighing the outflows right now. Such a trend implies there is currently demand for trading away the asset among the investors. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Signal: Shark & Whale Population Sharply Growing On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies the holders are making net withdrawals from the exchanges, potentially holding onto their coins in the long term. What implications either of these trends would have on the wider market depends on the exact type of cryptocurrency the one in question is: stablecoin or volatile asset. In the context of the current topic, Santiment has cited the data for Ethereum and Tether, which means both types of coins are relevant here. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Exchange Flow Balance for the two assets over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Flow Balance has recently observed a sharp negative spike for both Ethereum and Tether recently, implying that investors have been taking large amounts of these coins off into self-custody. For volatile assets, trading the asset away can have a negative effect on its price, so the exchange reserve going up can be a bearish sign. The Exchange Flow Balance being negative, on the contrary, can be bullish, as it implies the potential “sell supply” of the coin is decreasing. During the latest outflow spree, investors have withdrawn 80,763 ETH (almost $268 million) from these platforms, which is the largest outflow spike in five months. Thus, Ethereum has seen its sell supply go through a significant decline. In the case of stablecoins, exchange inflows also mean the investors want to swap the asset, but as these tokens have their value “stable” around the $1 mark by definition, such trades have no effect on their price. This doesn’t mean that they aren’t of any consequence to the market, however, as investors usually use stables to buy a volatile asset like Ethereum, so large exchange inflows of a stablecoin like Tether can be bullish for these other coins. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins Seeing Less Interest Than Bitcoin: Data In this view, the exchange reserve of USDT and other stables can be considered as a potential “buy supply” for the volatile cryptocurrencies. Recently, USDT has seen net withdrawals of $346 million, meaning that this buy supply has gone down. “This reflects less buying power for future purchases from traders, which is generally a necessary ingredient needed to boost prices in the long run,” notes Santiment. It now remains to be seen how the Ethereum price will develop in the near future, given that both bullish and bearish developments have simultaneously occurred in the market. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,300, down more than 3% over the past week.

31778256,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632573,1722481242,"BNB Chain TVL Slumps 24% In Q2, Yet Vital Metrics Surge In Double Digits","The BNB Smart Chain (BSC) experienced a mixed performance in the second quarter (Q2) of the year as the broader cryptocurrency market cooled off after a strong price surge in March. While BNB, the native token of the BSC, remained mostly flat, down 5% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), the network’s key metrics showed both positive and negative trends. Binance Smart Chain Revenue Plunges According to a recent report by market intelligence platform Messari, the chain’s revenue, which measures the total fees collected by the network, fell 28% QoQ to $48.1 million during Q2, although it was only down 8% year-over-year from $52.4 million in Q2 2023. According to the report, this decline was largely driven by the decrease in BNB’s price, as revenue in the network’s native token terms declined 51% sequentially from 165,100 BNB to 81,300 BNB. Related Reading: Analyst Says ETH Price Will Struggle As Spot Ethereum ETFs Expectations Crash The report also highlighted a decline in network activity, with average daily transactions decreasing 10% QoQ to 3.7 million and average daily active addresses dropping 18% QoQ to 1.1 million. This trend was not isolated to the BSC, as on-chain activity decreased across most smart contract platforms in Q2 following a strong Q1. Despite the overall decline, the report noted notable shifts in user preferences within the BSC ecosystem as decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap experienced a significant increase in daily transactions, up 630% QoQ, while the previously dominant PancakeSwap saw a 46% QoQ decrease. Staking Surges 30%, TVL Drops Messari also highlighted that the total BNB staked increased 30% QoQ to 30.4 million BNB, with the total dollar value of staked funds increasing 24% to $17.7 billion. This ranks the Binance Smart Chain as the third-highest Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network by staked value, though it still lags behind the Solana blockchain by a significant $38.4 billion. The BSC’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, however, saw a decrease in total value locked (TVL), down 24% QoQ to $5.5 billion, primarily driven by a 41% QoQ drop in borrowing on the DeFi protocol, Venus Finance. The company notes that this indicates that the overall decrease in value locked was partially due to the drop in value of the BNB token, which closed the quarter at a low of $567 after reaching an all-time high of $722 in March. Despite these fluctuations, Messari reported that the Binance Smart Chain maintained the third-highest decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume during the second quarter of the year, with $66 billion in total volume, trailing only Ethereum (ETH) and Solana. BNB Price Analysis At the time of writing, the BNB token was trading at $586, up over 2% in the last 24 hours. However, trading volume in the last 24 hours was down 3% to $830 million, according to CoinGeko data. Since Friday, the token has been consolidating between $570 and the current trading price, following the lead of the largest cryptocurrencies on the market, after a failed attempt on Monday to break through its nearest resistance wall at $590, which is the last obstacle preventing a move upwards to the $600 milestone.

31775307,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632561,1722475833,Is Bitcoin Poised for a September Price Surge? What Traders Need to Know,"As summer is currently fast approaching, several crypto traders and analysts have cranked up their optimism for Bitcoin price trajectory. Among them is well-known crypto analyst, Rekt Capital, who has recently shared insights on BTC next move, suggesting that the asset is poised for a significant breakout in September. This sentiment is echoed by other market analysts who have been closely analyzing recent trends and historical data. What the Bullish September Sentiment Is Based On Rekt Capital pointed out that despite Bitcoin’s failure to break out from its reaccumulation range post-April’s Bitcoin halving, it is still “on track for a September breakout”. Reaccumulation phases are typically characterized by savvy investors accumulating assets in anticipation of a price surge. Related Reading: Is A Major Bitcoin Dip Coming? What the Coinbase Index Tells Us This phase often sets the stage for strong market rallies. However, the complexity of current market conditions means that patience is essential, and the expected movements may unfold more gradually. Rekt Capital noted: History suggests that a breakout from the ReAccumulation Range mere ~100 days after the Halving was always going to be unlikely. Meanwhile, another prominent analyst, Daan Crypto Trades, has recently highlighted the technical patterns forming around Bitcoin’s price. According to Daan, the proximity of lower highs suggests significant liquidity above these levels, likely influenced by stop losses and short liquidations. This setup indicates that surpassing the June 7th high could trigger a comprehensive breakout, overcoming previous resistance levels. Conversely, support levels around $63,000-$63.5,000 are also crucial, as they represent areas where many investors might have placed long stop orders. This creates a balanced playfield, with Bitcoin trading in what Daan describes as “the middle of nowhere,” reflecting a market awaiting a clear directional signal. #Bitcoin With a couple of lower highs in close proximity of each other. Likely for a lot of liquidity to sit above these levels in the form of stop losses/liquidation levels from shorts. Seeing it’s also at all time high, I think once we take the June 7th high we’ll break all.… pic.twitter.com/O4B0CA0dBM — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) July 30, 2024 Bitcoin Market Performance and Fundamentals Currently, Bitcoin is trading at a price of $66,352, at the time of writing, following a 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. This price performance although small, has resulted in a roughly $6 billion added to the asset’s market cap. While Bitcoin’s current market performance might not be that appealing, a notable metric of the asset has suggested an interesting impending move. Related Reading: Elliot Wave Theory Suggests Bitcoin Price will Crash Below $40,000 Particularly supporting the bullish outlook mentioned above, a CryptoQuant analyst recently observed a notable increase in Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges. This trend, according to the analyst, can be a positive sign which could result in upward movement for Bitcoin as the available supply on exchanges diminishes, potentially driving prices higher if demand spikes.

He also mentioned what needs to happen for the flagship crypto to reach such an ambitious price target. How Bitcoin Could Rise To $428,000 Lavish mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin would rise to $428,000 when it becomes 1% of the $900 trillion investment assets worldwide. The hedge fund manager made this prediction while revealing that Bitcoin, at its current price, only accounts for 0.15% of the capital in these investment assets. Related Reading: Analyst Says ETH Price Will Struggle As Spot Ethereum ETFs Expectations Crash The idea is that BTC will become widely adopted to the extent that it sees most of the global liquidity flow into its ecosystem. Such an inflow of new money would undoubtedly spark a massive rally for the flagship crypto, seeing how much valuable assets like gold are currently worth, thanks to their liquidity. Interestingly, crypto pundit and Bitcoin maximalist Mark Harvey had previously shared a similar view to Lavish’s. Harvey predicted that Bitcoin could rise to $415,000 if it captured 1% of the global assets. Meanwhile, he made an ultra-bullish case for Bitcoin, predicting that it could rise to $17 trillion if it managed to capture most of the monetary premium of asset classes. The asset classes in question include gold, silver, equities, real estate, fiat money, and bonds. Harvey claimed that Bitcoin could steal a massive chunk of the global investment from these other assets as the flagship crypto becomes the most preferred option for people to preserve their money. The crypto pundit also described Bitcoin as a “superior form of property” to the rest. Indeed, a case can be made for BTC being superior to all other assets, considering how it has outperformed the traditional market over the last 14 years. NewsBTC recently reported that digital assets led by BTC have been the best-performing assets in 11 of the last 14 years. Bitcoin is again outperforming these traditional assets with a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 50%. BTC Could Well Be On Its Way To Achieving The ‘1%’ Status Bitcoin is undoubtedly enjoying a broader adoption in this market cycle, especially thanks to the launch of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are available not only in the United States but also in other countries like Hong Kong and Australia. Thanks to these investment funds, Bitcoin now has the attention of more institutional investors, who are becoming more inclined to the flagship crypto. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Show Interest In Cardano, Triggering 300% Surge Bitcoin will continue to enjoy an impressive liquidity flow into its ecosystem as more institutional investors become bullish. Moreover, Bitcoin’s being touted as a ‘digital gold’ has made it more attractive to investors since this narrative places it as a better option to gold. This has led to projections that Bitcoin could surpass gold’s market cap of $16 trillion. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that governments worldwide could also play a huge role in Bitcoin’s meteoric rise as they begin to adopt the flagship crypto as a reserve asset. A country like El Salvador is well on this path, while the United States could join soon enough, with Donald Trump promising to create a strategic national Bitcoin reserve if elected.
