42397568,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYeS,1397854745,Silicon Valley Job Fair to Match Bitcoin Professionals,"A Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator will host a bitcoin job exposition for those seeking employment in the cryptocurrency industry.  The Bitcoin Job Fair will take place on 3rd May at the Plug and Play Technology Center in Sunnyvale, California, from 1pm-5pm (PST).  Notable employers include Circle Internet Financial, BitPay and Blockchain, among others.  Scott Robinson, who leads bitcoin efforts at Plug and Play, told CoinDesk:  ""The entire message is to show, effectively, that bitcoin is hiring right now.""  Engineering talent  Robinson says that he expects over 250 job seekers to come talk with the major employers mentioned above, as well as smaller bitcoin startups that operate in Silicon Valley:  ""We’ve also paired with both the accelerator programs at Boost and 500 Startups, so a couple of their companies will be present.""  The employers at the fair will look for talent that can bring engineering and development expertise.  Important skills, according to Robinson, include an understanding of the bitcoin protocol, the bitcoin client, and of the measures needed to secure people's cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin companies want to become next-generation mainstream technology businesses embracing the new financial paradigm. People already working at established technology companies will be attractive to employers at the job fair.  Said Robinson:  ""I think we’ve moved from a fringe market [to one in which] people from Google and Apple are looking to jump on bitcoin.""  About Plug and Play  The Plug and Play Technology Center has been involved in the bitcoin space for some time now. It hosts the Silicon Valley Bitcoin Meetup every Tuesday at 6pm and is now accelerating bitcoin startups in its business incubator programme.  Blockchain's  head of security Andreas Antonopoulos is also expected to briefly speak to attendees of the fair around 3pm.  Robinson believes that the event could be one of the largest gatherings of global job talent in the cryptocurrency currency industry to date. He said:  ""The type of people that are coming to Silicon Valley for bitcoin are being drawn from all parts of the world.""  Startup accelerators, software development expertise and venture capital investment is making Silicon Valley one of the epicenters for bitcoin companies. This job fair is validation of that, Robinson said:  ""There’s definitely a [bitcoin] technology hub that is forming here. Not just because of the capital available, but because of the level of talent.""  Registration for the Bitcoin Job Fair is open and available for free for those interested in attending.

42397572,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYgQ,1397849459,Can Wearable Tech and Bitcoin Revamp Mobile Payments?,"The smartphone revolution kicked off a decade ago, but it really heated up over the past three to five years.  Smartphones are perhaps the most 'personal' computer used by the average person and, in terms of usefulness, they are the gadget equivalent of the Swiss Army knife. It's little wonder, then, that more than a billion people bought a new smartphone in 2013.  Engineers, developers and designers from Cupertino to Seoul and Taipei have clearly done an excellent job. Sadly, the same cannot be said of marketers, merchants and economists.  Few of them imagined that a phone could have the potential to turn the tech industry on its head and change business practices forever. For example, an estimated 355 million smartphones feature near field communication (NFC), but who actually uses it to make a payment? The same goes for Apple’s Touch ID.  The geeky smartphone ecosystem sounds like a technologist's wet dream and worst nightmare rolled into one – all that glorious tech is out there and most of it is going to waste. That sounds a bit like bitcoin, doesn’t it?  Where is the mobile payments revolution?  While most people are quite happy to buy a new smartphone, very few of them use it for mobile payments. Bringing one-tap payments to every consumer is an elusive goal and there are a number of reasons for that.  The retail industry was not too keen to embrace new technology, because it’s not easy to deploy and there has not been much demand. In terms of online purchases, consumers still prefer the good old desktop, as the tablet and smartphone user interface is still not as convenient.  Then there’s security: many people still worry that if they lose their phone they might also lose vital credit card info and other personal data. Most of these problems can be addressed and, indeed, are being addressed currently.  So, the mobile payments revolution hasn’t yet materialised, but there have been some positive developments.  Bitcoin is a great medium for mobile payments on more than one level. No credit card data is held in bitcoin wallets, every smartphone can scan QR codes, and hassle-free bitcoin transactions are cheap and fast – however bitcoin is still just too small to make much of an impact.  Wearable craze coming to a theatre near you  Wearable technology is starting to look like the next mobile craze: analysts are bullish and the technology is maturing fast. However, once again many people are scratching their heads and trying to come up with practical applications for wearables, other than fitness trackers.  So how about using wearables to make payments? That is starting to look like an increasingly promising concept: wearable gear is harder to lose than a smartphone or wallet. There’s no need to go rummaging through your bag or pockets when you need to make a transaction and authentication is not a problem either.  The Nymi smart wristband is a good example of truly practical wearable tech. The Nymi features an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor and, since every person’s ECG is unique, the wristband offers 'always on' authentication – as long as it’s on your arm and your heart keeps pumping blood. Therefore, you can make a payment simply by tapping it.  The wristband also features a bitcoin wallet, and the company claims it is one of most secure wallets out there.  However, the Nymi is a niche product designed for a specific use and it will stay that way. Making wearable payments more than a gimmick requires mass market devices with mainstream appeal, and we are finally starting to see such wearables – gear that an average non-geek would like to wear.  Here’s a quick test: would you rather wear Google Glass or the upcoming Moto 360?  We thought so – looks are no longer the problem, but the fact that there are currently very few practical uses for wearables remains a concern.  More integration, more possibilities  The Mobile World Congress in Barcelona is always a good place to check the state of the industry. This year the event was marked by heaps of smart watches and other wearables.  The focus is there and Google left the best for last: a couple of weeks after the event, the search giant announced Android Wear, a streamlined version of its Android mobile OS designed solely for wearables.  Android Wear brings more standardisation, more useful APIs for developers, more incentive to develop cross-platform apps and so on. Android Wear will be open to everyone and, since Google isn’t as hostile towards bitcoin as a certain fruit-logoed gadget maker, bitcoin developers will be free to devise new ways of bringing seamless payments to emerging platforms.  That’s not all. Google recently introduced a few changes to Google Wallet, lessening its reliance on NFC and smartphones. Google is now using cloud-based host card emulation to store sensitive data and Google Wallet is now a core service in Android 4.4 KitKat.  As the system is cloud-based, Google Wallet can now be accessed from anywhere. It is not limited to NFC-enabled phones, users do not have to re-enter their credentials every time they use it, more credit cards can be added, and so on. Bitcoin developers could learn from this approach.  [post-quote]  Google says it is focusing on improving user experience, making wallet payments seamless. Making money comes later, Google has to broaden the user base first.  Many bitcoin developers face a similar problem. Like Google Wallet, bitcoin is not a mainstream form of payment and much of their effort goes into making the services good rather than turning them into cash cows. Google’s approach offers a lot of possibilities for bitcoin developers, who can emulate it or use off-the-shelf Google technology to speed up and standardise development.  Biometric authentication on wearables and smartphones, smart watches that display QR codes, cold storage on wearable gear – all this is relevant to bitcoin developers and users too. In fact, bitcoiners could even out-innovate established players in the field of wearable payments. The industry was not quick to seize the opportunities offered by smartphones, big players just don’t tend to move as fast as small, lean, bitcoin outfits.  Wearable payments will not be a ‘killer app’ for bitcoin, and they won’t cause adoption to skyrocket overnight. However, wearables could give bitcoiners the opportunity to devise services that will offer something truly new, rather than simply emulate the credit card industry.  The only downside is that much of this work will have to be done by enthusiasts, as there is still little money to be made in this particular field.  Still, there are plenty of bitcoin developers willing to put a lot of effort into creating that ‘killer app’ for wearables, but it may be a while before we see the new services in action.

42397551,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYQg,1397844318,"All Things Alt: Shibe Social, Blackcoin Boom and the Twin Easter Egg","Things in the alternative digital currency ecosystem got a little more interesting this week. Let's take a look at some of the noteworthy news items from the last seven days in the altcoin world.  Dogecoin enters the limelight  Follow the Coin announced that it is partnering with dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer on Dogecon SF in San Francisco on 25th April.  This convention brings an interesting array of speakers and attendees, including litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Dogetipbot co-founder David Dvorak. The event aims to highlight the charitable aspects of the community, and there will be food, fun, costume contests and, of course, shibes as far as the eye can see.  In other dogecoin-related news, US-based digital currency exchange CoinMKT launched a DOGE/USD trading pair.  Blackcoin breaks out  Blackcoin had a banner weekend, experiencing a dramatic price increase and subsequent fall that still represents a significant increase in the altcoin's value compared to a week ago.  After spending several days in the 0.00009 BTC range, the price of a single blackcoin began to rise quickly on 12th April.  The price peaked on 14th April, reaching 0.00094505 BTC on the MintPal digital currency exchange. Within hours, prices declined to roughly 0.00019000 BTC. MintPal's 24-hour volume approached 10,000 BTC, causing the need for emergency server upgrades at the time.  At press time, the price of a single blackcoin was fluctuating between 0.00035 and 0.00039 BTC.  Limecoin community lends a hand  IPO-structured scams have become increasingly prevalent in the past few months on the Bitcoin Talk forum and other public forums for digital currencies. A recent scandal involving edgecoin – which involved an IPO for early investors prior to launch – resulted in some unexpected charity from another alt-community.  On 17th April, the limecoin development team announced on Bitcoin Talk that it would donate 500 LIM to anyone who could verify themselves as an investor in edgecoin:  ""We understand this is a small amount of currency compared to what many of you invested in edgecoin, and we apologize that we do not have the funds to do more. We are trying to help in any way we can. We encourage other coins to please do the same.""  Strange alt of the week  This week's ""Strange Alt of the Week"" is actually shared between two candidates which are set for a twin launch on Easter Sunday.  GirlCoin (sign: GIRL) and BoyCoin (sign: BOY) are being pitched as two coins of the same side. Each scrypt variant sports a 10 billion coin maximum supply limit and will have their own independent wallets.  The community response seems to be one of mostly amusement, although it will be interesting to see how mining hashrates divide between the two coins.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | LTC | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/18/all-things-alt-shibe-social-blackcoin-boom-and-the-twin-easter-egg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3e22c6fffac9895c1b3f74e92db8d44f5e57421-1382x954.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397594,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYZX,1397840432,LocalBitcoins Releases Investigation Report on Site Wallet Issues,"Following yesterday's statement from LocalBitcoins regarding issues with its wallet service, the website has released its follow-up investigation report.  The report focused in part on claims that the site's two-factor authentication failed to prevent a wallet breach. LocalBitcoins also addressed the cause of withdrawal delays that took place as users tried to move their bitcoins away from the site following the posting of user concerns on reddit.  The LocalBitcoins team wrote in the report's introduction:  ""LocalBitcoins team did not found any evidence of compromised site security.""  Report walks through hack claims  LocalBitcoins presented an activity timeline of user don4of4 (who initially posted on reddit), including 17th April when the wallet intrusion took place.  The site's team identified that unlike previous logins by the user, someone accessed the site via a Tor browser and had access to don4of4's two-factor authentication key generator.  LocalBitcoins surmised that whoever accessed the user's account had gained access to his mobile device, which don4of4 told the team was used to store the two-factor codes.  The report read:  ""In this case if the user used this particular Android device to access LocalBitcoins and the device was compromised, the attacker gained access to user password, user session ID and two-factor codes. Furthermore, it was reported on the reddit that the credentials of this particular user have been found on known compromised user account lists spreading in the internet.""  LocalBitcoins added that it does not currently offer session fixation as a security measure. However, the development team will look into the matter as a possible future offering for users.  LocalBitcoins addresses withdrawal problems  As stated previously, concerns regarding the site's integrity resulted in increased withdrawal traffic. Withdrawal delays led to increased anxiety among the site's users.  LocalBitcoins said in its report:  ""When the LocalBitcoins hot wallet was being emptied due to high volume of withdraws, the withdraws started to delay. LocalBitcoins choose not to top up the hot wallet until the incident is investigated.""  The site added that the majority of its bitcoins are in cold storage.  Wallet malware issues detailed  LocalBitcoin's initial 17th April statement suggested that a malware intrusion had resulted in the loss of some users' wallet credentials.  The investigation report elaborated on this point, saying:  ""In all of these cases the user account had no two-factor authentication and had a login coming from an IP address not associated with the users prior behavior pattern. We believe this was an incident either with reused passwords or malware-infection on the use computer.""  The report also recommended that all users adopt two-factor authentication for its account, saying that the site is unable to tell the difference between a user login and one from an unauthorised source.  Tough landscape for wallet owners  Malware targeting bitcoin wallets have increased in number significantly in the past year, posing problems for users who don't keep their bitcoins in cold storage.  A recent report by cybersecurity firm Kapersky Labs showed a sharp increase in bitcoin wallet intrusions and attempted intrusions in 2013, compared to 2012 levels.  A separate study conducted by digital security firm Dell SecureWorks found that nearly 150 strains of malware were currently circulating the internet as of February 2014.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/18/localbitcoins-releases-investigation-report-on-site-wallet-issues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba34c52cb666d4a6320e7323753c273d4a605ff3-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sao Paulo, Brazil  Latin America got its first bitcoin ATM this week, thanks to MercadoBitcoin in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Australia  Maybe they call it 'The Lucky Country' thanks to its regular supply of 'first' bitcoin ATMs. In any case, Australia got lucky again this week with a Robocoin machine.

42397558,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYWa,1397833369,The Bitcoin Word Game,"Words are very important. Even more so with bitcoin, competing constituencies craft specific words and phrases to evoke a predetermined image or outcome.  With a little help from political wordsmith observer Bill Maher, let's look at some popular examples of this practice in action.  Avoiding the negative  For a long time, assisted suicide as a positive right with legal protections had a difficult time gaining acceptance. Once it was phrased as aid in dying, several US states passed legislation protecting the practice.  Gay marriage is another. Political opponents deployed the phrase when they wanted to convey the idea that the sanctity of marriage was under assault or its meaning was being diluted. Once it became termed marriage equality, it was difficult to be against because it then sounded trendy, inclusive and friendly. Everyone is for equality.  Lastly, when we hear the phrase drilling for oil, we imagine huge nameless corporations raping the wilderness to satiate an out-of-control demand for fossil fuel. However, re-brand it as energy exploration and we visualize a futuristic and responsible effort to transform our planet's energy needs.  Steering public perception  In the evolving lexicon that is bitcoin, governments and the media consistently deploy phrases to gain an advantage in steering public perception. No secrets there. But, few of us can peer through the facade.  Here are some of the easy ones:  Privacy has become anonymity. Of course, people desire privacy and they rightly should take it for granted, but the word anonymous implies that it is secrecy being used for something nefarious.  Personal purchases have now become untraceable transactions. Remember that first drug store item that you wanted to keep as a personal purchase, so you made sure that no one saw you and that you used cash.  Finality of payment has become irreversibility. In the eyes of regulators, irreversibility has come to be associated with criminal transactions because who else would see the need for a transaction irreversible by a third party. Of course, this is ridiculous because many transaction classes have a proper need for payment finality.  [post-quote]  Interestingly, this choice of wording permits opponents to cast bitcoin as anonymous, untraceable, and irreversible – all fitting into the dark persona of the notorious Guy Fawkes mask.  By the way, paper cash in your wallet today already possesses those attributes (analog equivalent rights), which is why we are witnessing a global war on cash or, as its proponents claim, a modern cashless society.  Moving into the regulatory sphere – and no jurisdiction is exempt – the stakes are higher, so predictably the labels have become more elevated.  Financial privacy has become money laundering. More than 30 years ago, money laundering did not exist because it is a made-up crime, as Doug Casey says, and the so-called thoughtcrime of finance. Unfortunately, individuals seeking financial privacy have been cast as promoters of money laundering ever since.  Financial surveillance has been re-branded as patriotic anti-money laundering and know-your-customer guidelines. Realistically, it is still surveillance on a mass scale whatever you choose to call it.  Financial censorship has been re-positioned as an economic blockade, as in the international cases against WikiLeaks, Iran, and most recently Russia.  A positive spin  Every day, more and more young people embrace bitcoin. This is an encouraging demographic for the future of the cryptocurrency and they get it too.  For them, no government backing really means banks not required. Ignoring capital controls really means truly global with 24/7 availability. No third party for safety really means protection from financial surveillance. And, not centrally controlled really means easy person-to-person payments. Those are the things that matter most to that important demographic.  In economics, deflation is just another way of saying increased purchasing power.  In money, legitimacy is defined by community acceptance not by government decree. Triumphantly, bitcoin is money without government. If we don't defend ourselves in the word game, all that remains are the sheeple lest we be called domestic terrorists.  Please add your own important bitcoin words in the comments area below.

42397552,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYRf,1397827779,What Will Become of Your Bitcoins When You Die?,"The Law Society is urging people to leave clear instructions for their intellectual property and digital media in case of death.  Most of the digital legacy people leave behind when they shuttle off this mortal coil has sentimental value – it is not something that can be appraised or valued in hard cash.  Social network accounts, images, music, emails and backups of all of the above constitute the majority of our digital legacy. Families may want to access such information and preserve it for posterity. As more and more people store their data in the cloud and use their social accounts as repositories for photos and videos, digital legacy is slowly becoming as important as family photo albums or diaries.  Gary Rycroft, a member of the Law Society Wills and Equity Committee, warns people should not assume family members know where to look online and therefore need to make details of their digital life absolutely clear.  However, a lot of business is done in a purely digital form nowadays, hence an average person’s digital legacy is increasingly likely to contain some valuable information, projects, intellectual property and in some instances digital currency.  Bitcoin wallets are not bank accounts  Gaining access to a family member’s bank accounts after death is usually easy. Bankers and legislators have been dealing with the problem for decades and it is usually hassle free, as it is in nobody’s interest to antagonise grief stricken families. Every jurisdiction has a clear set of rules governing the matter and unless a dispute arises (usually between the family members), the process should be straightforward.  However, what if the deceased had a few bitcoins stashed away?  This is where it can get very complicated, especially given the basic idea behind bitcoin. Many people use it because it is pseudo-anonymous and many bitcoin operators are more than willing to cater to their needs, with multiple layers of encryption, authentication and a range of other services and security measures.  Furthermore, families usually can’t pay a visit to a bitcoin operator. The local bank branch is usually down the street, while bitcoin exchanges and wallet companies can be on a different continent.  The Law Society insists people leave clear instructions for their digital legacy. The instructions need to include a list of all frequently used online accounts that contain important personal information, or valuables. Ten years ago this wouldn’t have been much of a problem, as most people were content with an email address or two and an instant messaging account. Nowadays it is quite different.  The Law Society points out:    ""Having a list of all your online accounts, such as email, banking, investments and social networking sites will make it easier for family members to piece together your digital legacy, adhere to your wishes and could save time and money.      Not making your digital legacy clear could mean important or sentimental material – such as photographs on social networks – is never recovered.""    Executing digital wills is not easy  The problem is that passwords should not be recorded, not even in wills. In some jurisdictions, including Britain, wills are considered public documents and they can be published. Even if they are not, there is always a chance that the user will change the passwords years before the will is executing, rendering the effort useless.  Having the account names is usually enough, as services like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are used to being contacted by families of deceased users. However, in the case of bitcoin wallets, this can be a lot more difficult. Sometimes there is nobody to contact at all and sometimes bitcoin operators do not have access to login info.  In addition, simply ascertaining whether or not a person had any bitcoins or a bitcoin wallet can be a daunting task. If there is no will and no instructions, if family members did not even know about a person’s bitcoin holdings, they can easily be forgotten or destroyed. Bitcoins can be stored on all sorts of digital media, as well as physical wallets, they can be online, in the cloud, or on an inconspicuous paper wallet. They are easy to overlook.  If, on the other hand, the family realises some transactions were made to bitcoin exchanges, that might not be enough in the absence of clear instructions. Simply figuring out what happened to the money and whether there’s any bitcoin left could be a daunting task. Finding a bitcoin wallet won’t be of much help if it’s properly encrypted and no instructions are left behind.  Finding a wallet is just the first step  If the bitcoin wallet was left “open” and if the family knows about it, getting the money out is just a matter of a few clicks. However, this is only the case if the family is aware of its existence. If they are not, chances are the wallet will be overlooked.  Families may inspect smartphones or computers for valuable data, but very few people will look for bitcoin wallets if they are not specifically told to do so. What’s more, bitcoin wallets are tiny so they can be anywhere, from memory cards and USB sticks to network attached storage and cloud services, not to mention physical wallets.  Passwords that allow direct access to valuable information should not be kept in wills, but that does not mean that this cannot be done indirectly. The passwords can be stored somewhere safe, while the will can be used to pass down instructions.  [post-quote]  The will can lead to another document containing the passwords, it can name a person entrusted with holding useful information. Alternatively it can contain a password needed to access an encrypted document with detailed instructions, a document that can only be found by family members with access to the deceased’s personal belongings.  Back in December, we examined the possibility of using bitcoins to hide assets in case of divorce. Like any other asset, bitcoins can be hidden, although their usefulness for such shady practices could be limited due to volatility. Few people would be willing to store a substantial portion of their life savings in bitcoin.  However, legal experts caution that the number of estate issues involving bitcoins is likely to increase as more people start using digital currencies. People have been hiding assets for different reasons for centuries and digital currencies can be misused to that end like any other asset.  There are already a number of services and resources designed to handle digital legacy issues. These include digital will services like Entrustet, along with post-mortem messaging services and services that can store and encrypt data that can be released in case of death.  Needless to say, bitcoin users need to do their own research before entrusting their information with any service or drafting their digital will.

42397559,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYVb,1397823957,Former Neo & Bee Employees Release Damning Statement,"Former employees of Neo & Bee have taken to reddit to voice their version of the events that led to the demise of the Cyprus-based bitcoin company.  The post  , which is signed by Neo & Bee’s former COO George Papageorgiou and former compliance and risk management officer Øystein Aaby, details their view that they were “misled” throughout the company’s operation.  The post follows the publication of a statement on reddit by the company’s CEO Danny Brewster on 15th April. He asserted that he has in no way committed fraud and has not embezzled customer or company funds, as has been suggested.  In today’s post, the former employees convey their regret that the company ultimately failed and profit shareholders were not protected.  They go on to provide a detailed explanation of what they claim happened within the company, stating that the information has already been testified to the police in Cyprus, where a warrant was recently issued for Brewster's arrest.  According to the post, members of the company’s senior management team repeatedly asked Brewster to share the firm’s balance sheet and documentation relating to the number of bitcoins in its possession, which he failed to provide.  It continues:  “The CEO never divulged specific documented information regarding the IPVO bitcoins and amounts. To this date, and unless further information is revealed by Danny Brewster, the CFO is unable to account for the majority of bitcoins allegedly expended.”  The post goes on to detail a number of senior management meetings held at the Neo & Bee offices in the second half of last month. In these meetings, Brewster reportedly made contradictory claims about the number of bitcoins owned by the company and by him personally.  Demands  The former CEO and risk management officer claim that, on 20th March, Brewster was asked – and agreed – to step down as CEO. He then flew to the UK with the aim of raising investment.  “On the 31st, we sent him a demand letter requesting he returns and give explanations regarding his absence in the face of dire problems with the company, and the brand decomposing each day he is away and the company is unfunded. The deadline expired on 18:30 Cyprus time, April the 2nd, Wednesday,” the reddit post reads.  It concludes:  “We will remain in contact with the community and authorities to clear this situation out to its full extent.”  Brewster has been contacted for comment, but no reply had been received at press time.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/18/former-neo-bee-employees-release-damning-statement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1ce9bbd172b7547204ce1dc68d662a2fe7fc1ad-2560x1347.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377155,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zDiT,1397815455,Ron Paul: Bitcoin is not 'True Money',"Former member of the US House of Representatives Ron Paul does not believe bitcoin is ‘true money,’ but he is still a big fan of the concept.  Ron Paul is one of the most prominent libertarians on the US political scene. Much of the libertarian movement is in favour of digital currencies, either through active support and endorsement, or by advocating no government interference and regulation.  Ron Paul even got the distinction of having an altcoin named after him. He never shied away from controversial issues and he never kept his love of bitcoin a secret. Paul’s views on the state of our current financial system are more or less known and he reiterated his position on Quora this week.  Government should stay out of the way  When asked why he thinks bitcoin does not fit the definition of money, Paul said it is his personal opinion, but that it should be irrelevant in the big scheme of things.  “Though I don’t personally believe that bitcoin is true money, it should be perfectly legal and there should be no restrictions on it, there should be no taxes on it. The people who operate bitcoin would, of course, be prohibited from committing fraud but the people should be able to have competition whether it is a basket of commodities or crypto-currencies – it should be perfectly legal,” said Paul.  He argued that freedom from government intervention on the Internet is a prerequisite for the development of digital currencies. Paul said he is concerned that the government may want to curtail Internet freedoms. He warned that everyone should be concerned about government interference online regardless of their position on digital currencies.  Terrible monetary system debases currencies  The former Congressman pointed out that he sees bitcoin as a very interesting subject and that he has been a champion of legalising competition in currencies for many years.  Ron Paul went on to explain why he’s drawn to digital currencies:    “We have a terrible monetary system today. We have a government that purposely counterfeits and debases the currencies, and I believe that the alternative would be a competition. That means that anything that wants to substitute for the American dollar should be permitted.      There should be no prohibitions; there should not be a monopoly and a cartel running our monetary system because it so often benefits the privileged few. We certainly saw this in the bailing out of the financial system where the wealthy bankers got bailed out it in this recent and severe recession. I am a strong believer in competition. Bitcoin is an introduction to that.”    Paul stressed the importance of keeping the Internet free of government interference and at the same time keeping digital currencies alive and legal. He warned that the financial system is run by a cartel and by special interests.  “We want a system that truly challenges the government in their ability to take care of the very wealthy at the expense of the middle class and the poor,” he concluded.
