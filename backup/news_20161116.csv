42378954,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfSP,1479322507,ASX Exec Calls for Blockchain Use in Healthcare,"An executive at the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is signaling his support for blockchain applications in the field of healthcare.  In comments made in a speech delivered at the GovInnovate summit in Canberra today, Tim Hogben, group executive for operations at ASX, issued new remarks on the use case.  According to ZDNet, Hogben stated his belief that blockchain would improve business processes that require requesting and verifying health data.  Hogben said:  ""All this information is stored over various databases and they're not all secure. The blockchain or a ledger such as this is one way of capturing that and providing instant identification of those users.""  While notable, Hogben is not the first to suggest that distributed ledger technology could provide a solution to the problem of medical record storage and access.  Researchers from MIT's Digital Currency Initiative recently published a paper detailing a prototype called MedRec that aims to solve the same problem, and a use case for medical records has often been floated in blockchain circles (though not without its fair share of critics).  But ASX statements carry weight as it is currently building a blockchain platform as a more efficient mechanism for its equities clearing and settlement process.  ASX has already shown it is willing to invest in blockchain ideas that it believes have potential, as it has emerged as one of the top financial supporters for the Blythe Masters-led startup Digital Asset Holdings.  However, modernizing the sharing and tracking of medical records has proved to be a difficult problem to solve, as medical care often involves multiple agencies in different geographic locations, each of which may log and store data in a proprietary format.  Previous efforts to create a unified system have often failed, sometimes spectacularly. In the UK, for instance, an attempt to modernize and centralize NHS patient records was abandoned in 2013 after incurring project costs of £10bn.

In a blog post published today, the former lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core, bitcoin's dominant software project, Gavin Andresen wrote that regardless of the veracity of this person's claims he believes the public should ""ignore him.""  Andresen wrote:  ""I regret ever getting involved in the 'Who was Satoshi?' game, and am going to spend my time on more fun and productive pursuits.""  The statements come months after Gizmodo and Wired published articles that identified Australian academic Craig Wright as Nakamoto in May, and statements made by Andresen supporting the finding (though soon after, the reveal was disputed).  The following month, it was revealed that Wright was pursing a series of blockchain patents, giving him a potential financial motive for the claim.  Andresen elaborated on the fall-out after those events in today's post:  ""Either he was Satoshi, but really wants the world to think he isn't, so he created an impossible-to-untangle web of truths, half-truths and lies. And ruined his reputation in the process.""  Andresen directly addresses his audience imploring them to ignore Wright, regardless of the veracity of his claims. Instead, he says to leave the potential fraudulent claim to the alleged victims and law enforcement.  As for those ""more fun pursuits,"" we've reached out to Andresen for further comment, but at press time, have received no response.

Called the Korea Startup Market (KSM), the service is being provided in partnership with Blocko, a Korean blockchain startup that has produced a blockchain-as-a-service platform called Coinstack.  The Coinstack platform will provide document and authentication services for the KSM by checking against client references that have already been provided to the system by Korean banks like JB Bank, KISA, Lottecard, Paygate and others.  As CoinDesk previously reported, senior figures in Korea Exchange's planning team have been researching blockchain initiatives since 2015, convening a task force to give strategic guidance on how the technology could be used. But it is only now that the results are being released as part of the service KRX offers to traders.  Won-Beom Kim, Blocko CEO, said in statements that service marks the ""first example"" of how blockchain could be used in the domestic over-the-counter stock market as envisioned by KRX.  He added that Blocko is now striving to showcase how its blockchain offering could be applied to more industries, including bonds and promissory notes.

42378946,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfH5,1479308405,Peernova Quietly Collects $4 Million for Big Data Blockchain Play,"While some startups bask in blockchain hype, others are making a name by bucking the trend with an under-the-radar approach.  One startup that falls into the latter category is San Jose-based Peernova, a one-time bitcoin mining firm that now uses blockchains to solve enterprise big data problems. Long out of the spotlight, this could soon change as Peernova has raised $4m as part of an ongoing Series B, one that could prime it to become a bigger market player in 2017.  The funding, from Zhejiang Zhongnan Holdings Group, adds to the $13.6m it raised amid a shift to enterprise blockchain services in late 2014 and early 2015, and gives the China-based construction firm a 5% stake in its business.  But even with the new funding, CEO Naveed Sherwani and CTO Gangesh Ganesan said that Peernova won't opt to be more public about its work, choosing instead to eschew the idea that its use of blockchain even makes it a ""blockchain startup"" in the typical sense.  Sherwani told CoinDesk:  ""We've been studying the financial services industry for three years and we think we're one of the few companies that have really spent time studying. You don't see us doing press releases or doing keynote speeches.""  This research-first approach, Sherwani said, means that while most of its peers have focused on maximizing partnerships in certain topic areas (like clearing and settlement), it believes it has emphasized lesser-discussed workflow and reporting inefficiencies.  Sherwani said the firm is using blockchain to solve specific use cases where the querying of traditional databases is too time intensive using more traditional technology.  Armed with a product called Cuneiform (named after one of the earliest forms of writing), Peernova is seeking to help customers verify changes to subsets of larger data stores, without requiring the parties involved to deal with more data than needed.  ""[Financial firms] need trust between themselves and auditors, but they don't want to give them too much data,"" he said. ""They may need a small amount of data from six months ago, but that is a real problem.""  No ledger here  What makes Peernova more unusual compared to its peers is that it is using blockchain without using a distributed ledger per se.  That's because unlike those projects, Peernova isn't trying to establish trust between a number of trusted or untrusted parties. Rather, it's attempting to provide a reference point for a company, while using cryptography to replace the role of a more traditional auditor.  ""You don't give me any data, but I have a trust relationship with data inside your firewall. I can say, 'I know that data is safe', even sitting outside that firewall, I know that data has a cryptographic proof,"" Sherwani said.  Sherwani claims Peernova's products provide ""100% mathematical correctness"", or automated reporting with ""no misstatements"".  For example, in its partnership with State Street, Peernova is working to help hedge funds determine the tax liability for investments, using a blockchain system to trace and provide event history for dollars as they are invested and reinvested over years.  ""It's a complex workflow, and using cryptographic techniques, you can create systems that are faster and remove some of inefficiency when auditing,"" he said.  Where the blockchain comes in  While Ganesan acknowledged that many in the industry are using the term blockchain ""very loosely"", Sherwani contends Peernova implements the technology in the strict definition (in that it batches data into blocks).  Sherwani explained that Peernova uses a blockchain to provide cryptographic evidence of events and that can then be queried based on an understanding that the data being referenced is reliable.  Say you wanted to know that an employee had performed certain kinds of transactions on a certain day. Sherwani said a relational database could store a history of transactions, and then a team of auditors could be hired to establish links between these events.  Peernova's tech, he said, allows those connections to be created within a blockchain-type database in real time, enabling these events to be further studied more easily and more dynamically later on.  ""You can extract a subgraph, and you know, since we have all these linkages in an immutable database, you get the whole picture, all the ins and outs of that deal, and you know no one could have modified anything. That gives a lot of confidence,"" he said.  No PoCs  Peernova isn't prioritizing proofs-of-concept either.  While startups like R3 and open-source communities like Hyperledger have sought to collect groups of financial institutions for tests and trials, Peernova has sought specific partnerships with companies it said are willing to build what Ganesan called a ""final product"".  ""Our goal for 2017 is to prove three to four projects that are in full production, to say here is the cost savings, here are new solutions they've obtained for problems they could not solve without this technology,"" he said.  This requirement, Ganesan said, has meant that it has taken Peernova a longer time to identify customers.  Compared to many firms, Peernova set a modest 2016 goal, to take on three projects that met its criteria.  Heading east  One area where it does have commonality with its peers, though, lies in the fact that it has China on its radar for 2017.  As profiled by CoinDesk, such an expansion is also on the agenda for the open-source Hyperledger platform, and it has been the area where R3 has arguably seen the largest, recent growth in new members.  Sherwani said the goal is for Peernova to compete its Series B by the first quarter of 2017, and that it plans to start a joint venture with Zhejiang Zhongnan sometime next year. In this way, Peernova is also following startups including Circle and Ripple, which have leveraged strategic partnerships to set up shop in Asia.  Ultimately, however, Sherwani said you might not hear about any of these moves in upcoming press releases, as he said Peernova is still looking to prove that its technology is worth the attention.  Sherawni concluded:  ""We think it's best to find true customers and solve problems, and come back and tell people. To say, here's a solution and we can build a sustainable company. At this stage, it's too early.""

42378960,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfXR,1479304749,Bitcoin's Lightning Network is Now Digital Asset Compatible,"With Bitcoin's Lightning Network nearing launch, the number of tests seeking to upgrade the micropayments network is on the rise.  Now, industry startup Colu has unveiled a demo of how Lightning could be made compatible with colored coins (a technology that enables small amounts of bitcoin to represent other assets, such as the US dollar, stocks, or even houses or cars). Mashing this concept together with Lightning could mean more of these transfers at a higher speed.  Users can now send test transactions over the so-called ""off-chain"" network using Colu's demo, which perhaps offers the first user-experience for a Lightning Network project. The team worked with the startup Lightning Labs, tweaking its existing code to make it compatible with colored coins.  But are near-limitless transfers of mortgage records really necessary?  Colu co-founder and VP blockchain Mark Smargon said that he thinks that this functionality could help solve one of colored coins' bigger problems, while conceding that it might not be necessary for every use case.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The biggest argument against colored coins is it doesn't give you scale right now. Bitcoin transactions are very slow to verify, expensive to approve and there is a bottleneck of the low amount of transactions per second.""  He argues that the low-hanging fruit for this functionality is local currencies, a use case that has become a big focus for Colu, which raised nearly $10m earlier this year in its bid to narrow its focus from colored coins more broadly.  An interface for the idea  A couple of years ago, we saw the peak of debate over the size of a field in bitcoin's code (called OP_RETURN) that companies and developers use to store extra data on the blockchain for use cases such as colored coins.  Another small tweak to the protocol, it emerged as a contentious idea because of the possibility that it could ""bloat"" the blockchain in a way that harms overall scalability. Since all volunteers that are running bitcoin nodes need to store the extra data, the argument was that transactions that weren't peer-to-peer digital currency exchanges were perhaps unwanted freeriders.  But as Smargon suggested, making colored coins compatible with a platform that grows the network from roughly three transactions per second to millions of transactions that occur off-chain could mitigate the issue.  The demo shows how users might see this process.  Once you click the page, a new Lightning account is automatically created (the random string of numbers that it calls your ""Lightning ID""), and it starts the user off with fake money ($5,000) that he or she can transfer over Colu's colored coins-compatible test version of the Lightning Network.  This is a demonstration of how the bitcoin in your account can represent US dollars with the help of the OP_RETURN field that adds more information about what the bitcoin are ""colored"" to represent.  Smargon explained how channels can be updated using the same pattern that Lightning Network already uses.  Once a ""colored"" transaction with OP_RETURN is initiated to open a channel, the channel parties can update the value back and forth off-chain. When it comes time to settle on the blockchain, the OP_RETURN data will reflect the finalized balances.  Charging ahead  Behind the scenes, the demo runs over ""simnet,"" a simulated private bitcoin network run by Colu.  Smargon said that it would work much the same on the bitcoin testnet and that it's ready to go on the real bitcoin network, at least, if and when a feature known as Segregated Witness is triggered on the main bitcoin network that will the enable Lightning Network.  (Miners can begin signaling their support for the feature once a certain number of blocks have been added — probably as soon as 18th November).  For now, the demo's a taste of what the network might look like once it’s ready for users.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Colu and Lightning Labs.

42378963,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfYh,1479303008,The Price of Bitcoin Just Jumped $30 in One Hour,"The price of bitcoin rose nearly $30 over one hour of trading today, spiking to $740 as it continued to test 2016 highs.  The sudden boost followed a relatively slow uptick over the course of recent trading sessions, with the price fluctuating between $706 and $713 from 0:00 UTC on 15th November to 12:00 UTC today, figures from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index reveal.  However, that would soon change as the price began rising quickly, spiking nearly 4% over the course of just 60 minutes today.  Speculation on social media credited the boost to a weakening of China's yuan, a theory that is supported by the fact that China-based bitcoin exchanges continue to account for the lion's share of trading, but that perhaps lacks credible anecdotal evidence.  Equally possible is that the uptick was driven by low liquidity in the bitcoin economy and sudden surge in demand.  As profiled in CoinDesk, experts believe a number of recent price spikes could have been caused by single traders due to a lack of market depth. At press time, a representative of the bitcoin trading community Whale Club suggested rumors of a 500,000 BTC order at an exchange may have caused the uptick.

42378945,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfFp,1479299458,Singapore's Central Bank to Test Blockchain-Backed Digital Currency,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will soon test how it could issue digital currency using a blockchain-based interbank payment system.  According to Bloomberg, the planned proof-of-concept will be supported by blockchain consortium R3CEV, as well as eight banks and an unnamed local stock exchange. The Development Bank of Singapore, HSBC, Bank of America, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi are all said to be participating.  In a speech on Wednesday, MAS managing director Ravi Menon said the test could come to include other central banks. Further, he credited the bank's desire to remove cost and friction from traditional bank transactions as the motivation for the effort.  Menon said:  ""Today, banks have to go through correspondent banks to intermediate these payments. It takes time and adds to cost. This project marks the first step in MAS's exploration of ways to harness the potential of central bank-issued digital currency.""  Bloomberg reports the trial would find banks depositing cash as collateral with MAS, which would then issue a digital currency to participants. The digital currency could then be exchanged among participants in the system and later redeemed for cash.  The forthcoming trial bears similarities to a previously announced effort from UBS, Deutsche Bank, Banco Santander and startup Clearmatics in August.  Called Utility Settlement Coin, the project envisioned how a central bank could issue digital currency that could then be redeemed for cash held by a central bank.

42378942,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfEZ,1479297666,Blockchain Capital Dries Up as Big FinTech Deals Decline,"Cash is drying up for bitcoin and blockchain startups amid a broader decline in FinTech funding, according to new research from KPMG and CB Insights.  The reporthttps://www.cbinsights.com/research-fintech-q3-2016  , published today, shows that for the third straight quarter, VC investment in startups using distributed ledgers declined.  While enthusiasm for the technology remains, the report said that companies shouldn't expect additional funds until countless proofs-of-concept emerge on the market.  The report reads:  ""The ability to move blockchain from proof-of-concept to adoption and production has been minimal. While the market is still giving blockchain companies plenty of room to prove themselves, investors are also becoming more concerned about results.""  In the third quarter of 2016, a total of $87m was invested in bitcoin and blockchain startups, according to the report, a decline from $119m invested in Q2 and $153m in Q1.  But the other key takeaway from the ""Pulse of Fintech"" report is that there was also a global decline in FinTech funding, while total deal activity fell.  ""While we continue to see significant investment into fintech companies globally, the euphoria for mega-deals that we saw into the latter half of 2015 has waned,"" Anand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights, said in a statement.  Overall, blockchain is listed along with roboadvisors and AI as FinTech tools that will continue to “to attract more attention over the next few quarters"", though this could depend on the success of PoCs.  Around the world  But while venture capital for blockchain innovation is on the decline, different regions tell different stories.  The US and Denmark are listed as the top countries participating in blockchain investment, while a particularly slow quarter for Europe is blamed in part on uncertainly following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.  An ""uptick"" in Asian investment in blockchain and financial technology more generally speaking is credited with the region’s interest in its potential to help it expand beyond its traditional borders.  As such, KPMG China's fintech and innovation partner, Raymond Chang said investors remain interested, just not in massive rounds.  ""VC investors are putting a lot of money into small blockchain technology companies in Asia,"" Chang said in the report. ""Some very new companies are already into their second or third round of funding.""
