The price at which miners are willing to sell usually correlates with how much profit that they can make from selling the coins that they have mined. Depending on the price of the asset, miners usually choose to sell or hold it. This could influence the market price of bitcoin. Related Reading | Number Of Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Hits All-Time Low, How This Affects The Price Profitability is the major reason for mining. But when profitability goes down, miners either sell and cut their losses, or the other option, where they can hold on to their coins and wait for the price to get a point where profitability increases. According to the Puell Multiple, miners are currently choosing the latter. Holding their coins instead of selling for lesser profitability. Miner Profitability Drops Data shows that miner profitability has dropped in comparison to the last time that bitcoin was at this price. The profitability for bitcoin back in April at $50K had been 40% higher than it is right now when bitcoin hit $50K again. This means that miner profitability is hitting the lows at all-time highs. This drop in profitability has seen miners refusing to sell the BTC they are rewarded with for mining blocks. Instead choosing to hold these coins in wait for much higher prices.

42376315,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7oB,1629928976,What Binance Smart Chain’s Lagging Performance Means for Layer 1 Blockchains,"It was not long ago when Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was beating Ethereum by several blockchain metrics, but the former Ethereum alternative darling has seen its growth slow amid intensified layer 1 blockchain competition.      A growing number of “rug pulls” or exploits on BSC, meanwhile, has also raised questions around BSC’s security, as some BSC users have left the platform over fears about the safety of their funds, according to analysts.      BSC’s challenges show that while attracting new capital via cheaper, faster transactions is a first key step for any smart contract blockchain, security and decentralization are still essential for retaining users in the long run.      Although still the No. 2 blockchain by total value locked (TVL), the layer 1 blockchain supported by crypto exchange Binance, is far off its all-time TVL high in early May. TVL is the amount of crypto assets that are locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on the blockchain.      Other layer 1 blockchains, including Solana, Terra, and Avalanche, have hit record TVL highs in the past week.      Although Binance founder and CEO Changpen Zhao has not been shy on social media about BSC outperforming Ethereum, a BSC spokesperson told CoinDesk that BSC “does not compete” with other blockchains.      “TVL growth and retracements are driven by several factors, including importantly and primarily market conditions, which are very different from what it was when BSC’s TVL was at its all-time high,” Samy Karim, BSC’s ecosystem coordinator, told CoinDesk via Telegram messages.      “TVL alone does not indicate the health or performance of BSC’s DeFi ecosystem,” Karim argued.      Messari’s second quarter review on layer 1 blockchains highlighted that BSC was particularly hurt by the May market crash because most of the value locked on BSC was money-oriented capital looking for liquidity mining rewards, and the majority of assets on BSC had few use cases.      According to data from DeFi Llama, the top protocols by TVL on BSC are decentralized exchange PancakeSwap and lending protocol Venus. Both have plateaued since the TVL declined dramatically in early May.      Venus protocol faced more than $200 million worth of liquidations in late May, possibly due to a price manipulation of its native venus token. Meanwhile, PancakeSwap was taken advantage of in a flash loan exploitation worth about $45 million on another BSC-based DeFi protocol, PancakeBunny.      “BSC should've just rebranded to Binance Rug Chain,” Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari, said dryly, noting that the growing number of hacks on BSC-based protocols has scared away users.      In a Telegram chat, Venus’ global community deputy, “Danny,” who did not disclose their full name, told CoinDesk that the Venus team is working on several upgrades to improve its security.      “Once all the major changes have been completed, we will return to normal growth, most likely much faster than anticipated by others,” they said.      Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at another popular BSC-based DeFi protocol Alpaca Finance, argued that the increased number of attacks on BSC is “in approximate proportion to the sizes of the blockchains,” who noted that BSC is not the only blockchain that has suffered exploitations and failures.      “As networks grow, more suitable targets emerge for hackers to look at,” Douglas said. “The more high-TVL projects there are, the greater the number of hackers that will poke at their code for potential exploits. All of these emerging networks haven't hit that point yet since the majority of them only have one to three projects with significant TVL.”      Nate George, crypto asset analyst at Cumberland, the Chicago-based crypto trading unit of DRW Holdings LLC, argued that in developing layer 1 blockchains, one of the three fundamentals, scalability, security and decentralization, has to be sacrificed to optimize the other two, a so-called blockchain trilemma. In BSC’s case, decentralization was sacrificed.      The BSC blockchain’s security algorithm, known as Proof-Of-Staked-Authority (PoSA), is controlled by 21 node operators who are mainly controlled by Binance. BSC’s rise came as Ethereum's network became too congested and its gas fees skyrocketed. Gas refers to the computational efforts required to execute specific operations on a blockchain like Ethereum. Users must pay a fee in the blockchain’s native token to conduct a transaction.      Binance’s Zhao said in an interview with CoinDesk last year that the company had to sacrifice elements of decentralization to compete against Ethereum in designing BSC.      “There is a trade-off between more decentralization versus speed, so we thought that 21 nodes run by the community is probably enough,” Zhao said in the interview.      Venus’ Danny told CoinDesk that BSC’s fast speed and low fees are among the reasons Venus chose the platform, enabling it to provide users, including those in developing countries, with easy access to Venus’ lending and borrowing services.      BSC’s Karim said that for BSC to continue its “momentum,” the team at BSC and the protocols on BSC need to introduce “advanced security layers and build better user awareness.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/25/what-binance-smart-chains-lagging-performance-means-for-layer-1-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c94281b9839e928cc91d0fb7ba563844a956bbc-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rice, 33, was also the CEO of AriseBank, described as the world’s “first decentralized banking platform.”      Hundreds of investors spent a collective $4.25 million in fiat currency and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether to purchase AriseCoin. Rice must pay that amount in restitution, according to the sentencing.      Although Rice told investors that accounts at AriseBank were FDIC-insured and that the bank would issue Visa-brand credit cards, AriseBank was not authorized to conduct banking in Texas, was not FDIC insured, and was not partnered with Visa.      Rice was arrested in Texas in 2018 and pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud in 2019.      Instead of investing the money in AriseBank, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says Rice spent investor funds on personal items, including hotels, food, transportation and attorney fees.

42376320,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7yF,1629923231,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Back Above $48K, Expect Consolidation","Bitcoin is back above $48,000 as buyers responded to intraday oversold signals. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is up about 9% over the past week, compared with a 7% rise in ether and a 30% rise in Cardano's ADA. The bounce in cryptocurrencies occurred alongside gains in stocks on Wednesday.      Despite lower trading volume, analysts expect cryptocurrencies to consolidate near highs before buyers return for the next leg up.      EToro, a multi-asset brokerage, released second-quarter earnings Wednesday, reporting $362 million in trading commissions, a 125% year-over-year increase. Yoni Assia, eToro's co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk that traders have been diversifying across cryptos and stocks this year.      The platform's retail customers never really dropped out of the market during the price correction a few months ago, Assia said. ""The majority held through and continued to hold/add to cryptos,” he said.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $48,820, +1.32%  Ether (ETH) $3,222, +0.55%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4496.2, +0.22%  Gold: $1790.8, -0.67%  10-year Treasury yield closed 1.347%, compared with 1.289% on Tuesday  Bearish bitcoin bets    Hedge funds and other large traders continued to pile into bearish bets on bitcoin last week. The tally of short positions has increased by 6,000 since July 20 to hit the highest in three months. But the data doesn’t necessarily indicate that the traders are betting on outright price declines.      The spike in leverage funds’ short bets might have stemmed from a return of the so-called carry trade, which involves buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market against a short position in the futures market.      That means bitcoin market makers may be short on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and hedged on native exchanges, reports CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.    Subdued trading volume    The seven-day average real BTC trading volume is still around $5 billion, less than half of what the market witnessed the last time bitcoin was at $50,000, Arcane Research analysts wrote Tuesday in a report.      If trading volume continues to be relatively flat and bitcoin prices push higher, the market could become exhausted and the rally won’t be sustainable, the analysts said.    Cardano vs. ether    ADA is pulling back from an all-time high around $3 and could find lower support between $2.40-$2.60. The cryptocurrency remains in breakout mode after successfully holding the 200-day moving average in July.      Some analysts view Cardano, Solana, Terra and others as direct competitors to Ethereum.      “These blockchains are dubbed ‘Layer 1’ as they provide two main functionalities – settling on-chain financial activity and launching decentralized applications,” digital asset manager 21Shares wrote in a newsletter Tuesday.      “We believe this rise of Layer 1 [cryptos] outside Ethereum is predominantly driven and hyped by retail investors since institutional-grade investment products on these underlying assets are only available in our product suite, except for Luna, which no issuers offer at the moment,” 21Shares wrote.      ADA also broke out relative to ETH on Aug. 17. The ADA/ETH ratio appears overbought, but will likely hold support given renewed upside momentum in ADA.    DeFi stablecoin lending rates rise    The stablecoin lending rates in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market is ticking up, according to crypto data analytics firm Skew.      The increase could be short term but is worth watching closely, said Dan Weiskopf, co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF at Toroso Asset Management.      “If the doubling of the yield from the 3% to 4% range continues, there could be an issue in the promised land; nothing is free and getting paid a lot for something that is stable could be a sign of something to come,” Weiskopf wrote to CoinDesk.      ”This increase is also curious after July’s lull in trading activity, so we will be watching for volatility,” Weiskopf noted.    Altcoin roundup  Pyth launch to bring quant firms’ market data to Solana: Pyth Network – a key trading data pipeline set to service DeFi projects on the Solana blockchain – will go live on Thursday. Known as an “oracle” in crypto lingo, the data distributor will shortly begin pumping price quotes for crypto assets, foreign-exchange markets, futures and equities into nodes supporting Solana. There, developers can use it to build DeFi tools like lending projects.  Osprey readies SOL fund: Osprey Funds has readied a private SOL fund for wealthy investors, signaling growing institutional interest in the Solana network’s booming native token. The fund, called the Osprey Solana Trust, was registered with U.S. securities regulators Tuesday. It didn’t have any sales as of press time and is open only to accredited investors, which means that retail traders are shut out for now. That could change, though. Osprey is “seeking approval” for its Solana Trust to trade on the same over-the-counter marketplace that its bitcoin trust does, documents reviewed by CoinDesk show. The trust appears to be the first private SOL investment vehicle in the U.S.  Budweiser buys Beer.eth domain name for 30 ETH: Budweiser USA changed its Twitter profile picture Tuesday to that of a rocket ship designed by NFT artist Tom Sachs. Crypto watchers says the beer company also purchased the Beer.eth domain name for 30 ether, or roughly $95,000. ""Budweiser is taking its first steps into the NFT universe,"" an Anheuser-Busch InBev spokesperson told CoinDesk via email. ""We're excited to support Tom Sachs and his Rocket Factory project and join this incredible community."" A link to the DNS (domain name system) address on NFT marketplace OpenSea shows the rocket displayed in Budweiser's Twitter profile was bought for 8 ETH ($25,000).  Facebook is considering NFT support in Novi digital wallet: Facebook is “definitely thinking about” using its Novi digital wallet to support non-fungible tokens, David Marcus, the company’s head of financial services, said. Facebook is in a good position to explore supporting NFTs through its new digital wallet, though it is too early to talk about specific plans, Marcus said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday.

42376318,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7uT,1629919752,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Rises, Extending Recovery After China Crackdown","Bitcoin's mining difficulty – a measure of the amount of computing resources required to mine bitcoin – has increased for the third time in a row in yet another sign of the network's staying power following a crackdown on the industry earlier this year by authorities in China.      Mining difficulty is a key element of the Bitcoin blockchain's built-in self-stabilizing mechanisms. When more crypto miners are operating on the network, blocks tend to be discovered or mined more quickly. As miners drop off the network, they are found less frequently. To compensate, the blockchain's programming automatically adjusts periodically to ensure that data blocks continue to get mined on average every 10 minutes or so. This process was hard-coded into the Bitcoin blockchain's original programming when the network was launched over a decade ago.    Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works    At 14:41 UTC on Wednesday, the blockchain's mining difficulty increased by 13.2% at block 697,536, according to several mining sites.      The latest increase in the bitcoin mining difficulty comes as some operators creep back online after previously dropping off the network following China's crackdown and as North American miners expand capacity.      The Bitcoin mining difficulty resets roughly every two weeks and is a key gauge of the network's health as well as a crucial factor in determining miners' profit margins.    Read more: Bitcoin Miners Hold Onto Rigs, Betting the Bull Run Will Continue    As bitcoin’s hashrate, a measure of the total computational power being used to secure the blockchain network, hit a low point a couple months ago, bitcoin’s difficulty level recorded its largest drop in history, on July 3.      The 14-day moving average of the bitcoin hashrate has rebounded roughly 25% from its low point in late June, according to Arcane Research. The number stood at 123 exahashes per second on Tuesday, according to data from Glassnode. An exahash represents a quadrillion computations.      Even though the Bitcoin mining difficulty has been increasing, it’s still a good time for miners, industry experts said.      “Bitcoin mining has never been more profitable,” said Dave Perrill, CEO at crypto mining colocation company Compute North. ""Look at the percentage of price run that bitcoin had over the last 12 months and look at the hashrate percentage increase, and it's nowhere near in line.""

42421769,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpO8L,1629919451,Some Filipino Merchants Prefer Payment in Axie’s SLP,"Inside SM Aura, one of Metro Manila’s many sprawling shopping malls, you’ll find a wonderfully whimsical “co-baking” space called Bakebe. Pronounced Bake-be, the idea is borrowed from a concept store in Hong Kong that uses an app to teach guests how to bake the cake of their dreams. Upon arrival, you’re greeted by a gaggle of electric mixers straight out of Barbie’s Dreamhouse, and pink-frosting walls lined with big glass jars, each brimming with edible treasures: chocolate buttons, rainbow sprinkles, mini meringues, cookie crumbles and more.  And now, to top off your magical Bakebe experience, you can pay using magical internet money.  Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the Director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm based in Southeast Asia that represents play-to-earn sector clients including Animoca Brands, Yield Guild Games, Blockchain Game Alliance and others.  The Nextperience Group, Bakebe’s parent company, represents a portfolio of imaginative businesses catering to everything from kids’ birthdays to team-building events. In mid-July, it began accepting an Ethereum-based utility token called Smooth Love Potion (SLP) for payments. Since then, it has processed 50 online bookings totaling PHP 150,000 ($2,980) in revenue. Co-founder and CEO Nikko Que believes it would have closed many more sales had Manila not been forced back into lockdown at the end of July.  It's not the only merchant in on SLP, either. A quick quiz on social media turns up a bunch of advertisements for all sorts of things you can buy in the Philippines with SLP. Those include a pair of new kicks at SneakyX; a car service at Adz Garage, a polishing at Ecowash; insurance renewal at Divinagracia Insurance Agency; a test for COVID-19 at Swab Republic; a dermatitis treatment at The Healthician Clinic; an outfit for your toddler at Little Blossoms; a gift from SOLID TOYS; a laptop upgrade at Meron Ako; a massage chair at ZION; a milk tea at Chi Figata; a plate of dumplings at Mama’s Boys; and a session with online fitness coach, The Architect.  “The minting and acquisition of SLP has become an everyday task for a lot of people, so it’s useful to be able to spend it as an everyday currency,” said Joseph Moore, Que’s business partner. He’s referring to the obscure ERC-20 token originating from within the blockchain game, Axie Infinity, which has become a source of livelihood for many Filipinos.  The Bakebe boys say their customers tend to assess the price of SLP in terms of the effort it would take them to earn it. If a baking experience costs 150 SLP, they might say, “Oh, 150 SLP, that’s just my daily quest.”  Living in the Philippines, I’ve seen this tendency to value SLP in relation to real-world items, too. It seems the player community cares less about how much SLP is worth in terms of PHP or USD. A friend of mine, on his first day of playing Axie, excitedly told me he had earned three Chicken Joys in just a few hours. If you already know that Chicken Joy is a popular item on the menu at the much-loved fast food store in the Philippines called Jollibee, you’ll also know that this is a highly relatable and culturally relevant unit of account, understood instantly by Filipinos everywhere.  The birds and the bees of NFTs  To explain the purpose of SLP in Axie Infinity, I’ll need to give you a lesson on ""the birds and the bees"" of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You see, Axies are NFTs with the ability to procreate, and if you want to get a couple of adult Axies in the mood to make a baby, SLP works like Barry White and candlelight.  To acquire SLP, Axie owners pit their NFT pets against one another, and whoever wins is rewarded with little vials of the digital aphrodisiac as a prize. But if you’re not into breeding Axies, you can sell your hard-earned SLP on an open market in exchange for other cryptocurrencies.  In some countries, the trade volume for SLP is so high that progressive platforms are enabling users to exchange the token for the local currency. And here in the Philippines, a growing number of local merchants have gone a step further, with sellers willing to accept micro-doses of the stuff as payment for goods and services.  They do it all via a dedicated wallet, the Ronin wallet, which is basically MetaMask for Axie’s sidechain and allows users to conduct up to 100 free transactions every day. At the time of purchase, merchants take it on a case-by-case basis, checking the price of SLP on Binance before providing their customers with a timely conversion rate. Other sellers – specifically, those who are willing to adopt a win-some, lose-some approach – will dictate a fixed selling price that sits somewhere between SLP’s lowest and highest value for the month.  “There are more Filipinos with Ronin wallets than there are Filipinos with credit cards,” Que said to me via a Zoom call, with a twinkle in his eye. He was being cheeky, of course. While Axie’s growth in the Philippines has gone supersonic over the past few months, the rate of Ronin adoption isn’t that prolific, at least not yet.  But it may not be too far off. A Ronin-to-Ronin wallet transfer certainly offers a handy way for the underbanked to pay online. And while it probably isn’t how the Philippines’ central bank envisioned this to happen, it’s a big step toward the bank's goal of the Philippines becoming a “digital-heavy, cash-light society” with 50% of all transactions being digital by 2023.  Volatility schmolatility  Critics will scoff at the idea of an obscure and highly volatile in-game reward token being accepted and used widely for payments. We’ve heard plenty about that of late, what with the International Monetary Fund on its soapbox knocking El Salvador’s decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. But the “suitability” of any tender is highly subjective, and in the developing world, where many economies are still reeling from the economic fallout of COVID-19, volatility is a desirable problem to have if it means you’ve got paying customers. Volatility is a challenge that you can proactively manage within your business; a broader economic recession is probably not.  For the merchants that do choose to accept SLP, theirs is a savvy response to a newly cashed-up consumer segment looking to splash out. With the average player earning around 4,000 - 6,000 SLP ($520 to $780 at today’s prices) in mid-July, and more than half of Axie’s one million daily active users hailing from the Philippines, this represents a fast-growing group of people who are doing financially better than most amid a long and brutal economic downturn. The merchant seeking to serve them may secure a competitive advantage by allowing customers to pay for goods and services with the same currency they earn their income.  The alternative is cumbersome, to say the least. Players must first convert their SLP into a more digestible crypto, such as ether, via a decentralized exchange, such as Uniswap. From there, they can send to a centralized and locally regulated exchange with the ability to interface with fiat. And while plenty of early adopters were willing to jump through those hoops, it wasn't easy or convenient for them, and they weren't overjoyed about the fees that ate away at their pay every step along the way.  In the Philippines, there are a couple of solutions that have popped up to streamline the process, namely BloomX and Binance P2P, which offer an SLP to Philippine peso (PHP) trading pair. But if merchants will happily accept SLP at the point of sale, it removes the need for players to convert SLP altogether.  Smile Craft Dental Centre in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, has already had five patients pay with SLP since it began accepting it in July. “We have seen in many Axie Infinity groups that some scholars have no experience with trading and cryptocurrency and are finding it difficult to cash out their SLP,” said Nikko Alfonso, a chat representative at the clinic. He’s referring to those Axie players who leased the NFTs they need to play, rather than buying their own, and as such, haven’t yet learned the ins and outs of handling crypto for themselves – a process that might feel like having teeth pulled for a noob with no idea what to do. “We are giving them another way to exchange those SLP, while at the same time, keeping their teeth healthy,” said Alfonso.  Read more: How Axie Infinity Creates Work in the Metaverse | Leah Callon-Butler  It’s important to note that these merchants are not exactly random. Almost every merchant whom I spoke with was an avid Axie breeder, allocating a decent chunk of their company’s SLP revenue toward the cost of breeding more NFT creatures. In their eyes, if SLP loses value against the Philippine peso, it still retains its utility as an Axie love drug. In fact, that’s its primary purpose. Unlike a paper banknote, or even a bitcoin, SLP exhibits inherent utility because it can always be used to breed more Axies, making it akin to other goods-as-money payment tools with multiple uses that have been used over time like gold, rice, rum and cigarettes.  Of course, SLP’s utility isn’t much of a consolation prize if you’re not in the business of breeding Axies, but that only reiterates the ​​authenticity of this community and the real, organic demand for the token. In speaking to each vendor, I was struck by the fact that none was price-obsessed. They weren’t looking for arbitrage opportunities. They weren’t moving out of their SLP position at the end of each day, converting SLP to something more stable. They’d hardly noticed SLP’s recent price dip (it’s currently sitting at $0.13, down from an all time high of $0.36 in May and July), and they said again and again that they were prepared to hold the token until they need it for breeding, or until they see the price bounce back, however long that takes.  As Axie’s SLP takes on a life of its own, it’s caught the attention of the Philippines' tax office, too, which recently took the opportunity to remind everyone of their reporting obligations. In my mind, that only brings greater legitimacy to the play-to-earn movement, which is driving the usage of cryptocurrencies by everyday people in a way that the world has rarely seen. For these next-gen users, SLP is the elixir of community development, demonstrating that the definition of money is fluid and value is in the eye of the (be)holder.

42376322,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7wz,1629916740,"Bitcoin Miners Hold Onto Rigs, Betting the Bull Run Will Continue","Some bitcoin miners are sitting on their mining rigs in the hopes of selling them at a higher price as bitcoin’s rally continues.      “I know there is supply available,” said Vincent Vuong, director of sales and procurement at bitcoin mining and hosting company Compass Mining. “I talked to a lot of people. They all have thousands of units but nobody is willing to sell them.”      China’s crackdown on crypto mining sent mining rigs’ prices plummeting a few months ago, but the machines are now trading at a premium thanks to bitcoin’s recent bull run.      In recent weeks, bitcoin has seen some of its largest gains this year, boosting sellers’ confidence in the machines’ prices in the future.    Read more: Bitcoin on Longest Weekly Winning Run in 9 Months Ahead of Jackson Hole Symposium    Mining machines manufacturers like Bitmain and MicroBT allow their clients to pre-order the rigs and hold futures contracts for batches of machines that will be delivered on a predetermined future date. This practice has become more common as the coronavirus pandemic has slowed global logistics and created a crunch on the supply chain for materials to make the machines.      The practice has come about also because major chip suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have relatively small quotas for specified chips for bitcoin mining machine makers.      Both futures and spot markets for mining machines have already seen a significant increase in mining machines’ prices, signaling miners’ bullish expectations on the largest cryptocurrency’s price, according to industry pros.      Thus, there has been a dynamic futures contracts market for miners, brokers and speculators, who are making trades based on bitcoin prices and other factors that affect machines’ profitability like electricity costs.    Read more: Banished Chinese Bitcoin Miners Look to the West, and Far Beyond    “One of the major bellwethers for bitcoin’s market is the mining machines’ futures market,” said Franky Hu, chief business development officer at MyRig, a miner hosting services provider based in Russia. “When futures contracts of mining rigs are trading at a much higher price than current price, miners are betting on higher bitcoin prices, which leads to a wider profit margin.”      Rig prices across the secondary spot market appear to have bottomed out in July and have risen for three weeks in a row. The prices for different mining machines saw a 7.5% increase on average last week, the biggest jump since the rebound, according to the Rig Price Index by Seattle-based mining company Luxor.      The growth rate of the price of rigs in the secondary market indicates buyers are pricing machines based on a bullish outlook for a bitcoin price that can lead to wider profit margins, Ethan Vera, Luxor’s chief operating officer, said.      The price of the rigs is being set not only by how much the machinery itself is worth, but also by the expected profitability driven by market sentiment regarding the price of the bitcoin those machines could mine.      “Over the past three weeks, the rig prices have outrun bitcoin price; it shows that it is not purely based on current economics, but also future sentiment,” Vera said.    The upside    Early this week, bitcoin recrossed above $50,000 and has been logging gains for five consecutive weeks, which marks its longest weekly winning streak in nine months.      “When bitcoin price goes up, nobody has the incentive to sell their machines,” Vuong said. “There is a lot of upside potential.”      Miners and brokers raked in big profits during bitcoin’s bull runs in the past by making well-timed trades, Vuong said.      For example, the S9, which is one of the older models of mining machines made by Bitmain, was selling for up to $20, before last year’s bull run. However, at the peak of the rally in late 2020, the same machines were selling for $600 to $700, which is 30 to 35 times higher, Vuong said.      Trading mining rigs has become more strategic over time. Vuong even suggested that someone trading hardware might have been able to make more money than actually buying and holding bitcoin itself.      Even in the short-term bearish market, some sellers are opting to wait it out by running their mining machines on a hosting site. Doing so can generate daily profits, which can buy them more time while they wait for the bear market to pass, Vuong said.      What’s more, the sellers are generally able to realize a higher sale price on machines that are already plugged in. “The machine on the shelf is more valuable than those in the warehouse,” he said.    Chinese bitcoin miners calm down    Chinese miners were enthusiastic resellers in the first few months after the ban, resulting in a glut of secondhand machines in the market, according to Vera.      The State Council of China called for a sweeping ban on crypto mining and trading in May, creating a massive market of used mining machines, Vera said.    Read more: Why China’s Ban on Crypto Mining Is More Serious Than Before    Some of the large Chinese miners had been running mega mining farms, generating over 1 exahashes per second (EH/s) before the crackdown. After, around one million mining rigs went offline in China, according to Vera’s estimates. Exahashes is a measure of the computational power of a mining machine, which is a heavy-duty computer used to try to solve math problems in order to gain newly minted bitcoin. The computers also process bitcoin transactions.      “The ban forced them to unplug all their machines, which means they could lose millions of dollars everyday,” Vera said.      But now, miners are thinking longer term. “Miners are overall more patient in China, less frantic than they once were when the ban happened,” Vera said.      “They have come to terms with the fact that they are going to lose out on profitability this year and [are spending] more time thinking about how they are going to run their future operations.”    Arbitrage on bitcoin mining rigs    The massive market of used rigs has a price arbitrage mechanism that allows brokers to factor bitcoin's price into how much a machine might sell for.      At 11 every morning in Beijing, brokers in China update prices for mining machines and relay that information to brokers in North America. That daily update enables miners and brokers in China to factor bitcoin's price into their rigs’ prices in a matter of hours.      “Whenever the bitcoin price goes up, the machine prices would increase in the next couple of hours,” Vuong said. “No seller would honor the deal with buyers for more than a day unless the two parties have a really good relationship.”      While it could take just a few hours to raise rigs’ prices, it generally takes two to three weeks for them to fall after bitcoin prices drop, giving sellers enough time to adjust their prices.      “Once you saw bitcoin price dropping to around $30,000, it took more than three to four weeks before we started to see the hardware prices start to drop,"" Vuong said.      Yet the risk for holding mining rigs still exists because the machines depreciate in value as they tend to deteriorate over time, and miners might lose money sitting on a pile of machines in a warehouse if they cannot find places to operate them.      “Bitcoin mining now requires a lot more strategies,” Vuong said. “There are multiple ways to play it, and it is going to become less about who has the money to spend and more about who has the best future planning and strategy.”    A quiet comeback    Another reason that Chinese miners have stopped selling mining machines is because some of them are able to plug their bitcoin mining rigs back online and mine bitcoins in certain jurisdictions in China, according to two major Chinese bitcoin mining companies that declined to disclose their identities because of China’s laws and regulations on crypto mining.      “Given how much hashrate has come back online and most miners outside China are still building their mining facilities, we think some miners in China with at least a few hundred megawatts of capacity combined have started mining again,” one source said.      In response to the increase in global hashrate as more miners come back online, bitcoin’s mining difficulty rose by 13% today in the latest biweekly adjustment. This latest adjustment, the largest since July, marks the third consecutive upward adjustment.      On the other hand, another source said some Chinese miners might have to shelve or sell their mining machines after the rainy season in South China comes to an end.      According to the data from Arcane Research, the bitcoin hashrate 14-day moving average has held above 100 EH/s. That is a 25% increase from the lows.      But large public Chinese mining companies migrating out of China such as BIT Mining are not recovering at nearly the same rate, and miners outside China are still building new facilities to add more hashrate.      BIT Mining has been deploying thousands of its mining machines to new facilities in central Asia and North America, but only a few hundred petahashes/per second (PH/s) of the company’s hashrate has been recovered, compared with its theoretical maximum hashrate of 1425.3 PH/s (1.42 EH/s).      Private and small-sized bitcoin miners, on the other hand, are beginning to see a more positive future with China’s regulations on crypto mining.      “Right now, some miners in China think that some hashrate will be plugged back in China, especially with the use of Ethereum GPU (graphics processing unit) mining machines not being banned in the country anymore,” Vera said. “They think that maybe a few hundred megawatts can come back online by the end of this year in China and that has increased the sentiment of Chinese brokers and miners.”      There may be more increases in rigs prices in the long term as new institutional players such as family offices are entering the bitcoin mining industry, according to Hu of MyRig.      From power producers to real estate to family offices, a variety of non-crypto companies are eyeing bitcoin mining to diversify their revenue streams. “Every company is becoming a mining company nowadays,” Hu said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/25/bitcoin-miners-hold-onto-rigs-betting-the-bull-run-will-continue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/202478585b000419ea84027e60011093dd5084b3-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376314,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7qh,1629909774,OnlyFans' Porn U-Turn Is a Victory Against Banking Censorship,"OnlyFans this morning announced that it will reverse plans to ban sexually explicit material, saying in a statement that it has “secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community.” That suggests it has reached a better banking arrangement: The platform, primarily known for hosting adult content creators, had openly and explicitly blamed banks for the original ban on explicit content.      The ban, announced just a week ago, was met with widespread outrage both from adult performers and, more generally, those concerned about the power of banks to effectively shut down businesses they don’t like by cutting off payments service. Public discussion of that threat, often referred to as “banking censorship,” was likely a key element in the reversal of the ban.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely took a refreshingly clear and direct line on the porn ban, which was likely an existential threat to his very profitable firm. Speaking to outlets including the Financial Times, he explicitly placed blame on banks for blocking OnlyFans payments, saying that his company “had no choice” in the decision to ban explicit content. More than that, Stokely specifically named three banks that had refused to service OnlyFans: BNYMellon, JPMorgan Chase and Metro Bank.      Meanwhile, adult performers have been organizing protests against Mastercard scheduled for Sept. 1. Those may still continue and could be hugely embarrassing for banks and financial services – particularly to the degree they highlight payment processors’ ability to block pretty much any payment they please.      All of this marks a major defeat for efforts by social conservatives and other anti-porn activists to leverage the payments system to impose their views on society. It also appears to have more broadly raised awareness about the threat of banking censorship.    Read more: OnlyFans Stops Sex Acts and Politicizes Payments | David Z. Morris    Mike Stabile, director of public affairs of the adult industry trade group the Free Speech Coalition, detailed the backlash to OnlyFans’ decision in a Twitter thread published before today’s reversal. He noted, first, that the pressure groups that have pushed banks to crack down on adult businesses “are scrambling” because “95% of coverage about OnlyFans supports [sex workers].”      Stabile says the push has been led by the Christian group Exodus Cry and the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, formerly known (rather revealingly) as Morality in Media. Those groups lobbied Mastercard to impose a new anti-porn policy, according to Newsweek, that appears to have played a role in OnlyFans’ initial porn ban.      But, Stabile says, the groups “didn't expect so much of the [OnlyFans] coverage to paint them as bad guys, or to talk about their religious campaign.”      Banks, it seems, have been caught similarly flat-footed by the response to the OnlyFans ban – particularly compared with the response when similar moves were made against PornHub last fall, leading to policy changes at that site.      “Very few people are talking about illegal content [as they did with PH (PornHub)],” Stabile wrote. “Everyone is talking about banking censorship.”      When the banks came for the public’s porn, they knew, for the first time, exactly where the problem was and the right people to yell at. For cryptocurrency advocates who have spent more than a decade banging on about the threat of bank censorship, this may come to be viewed as a watershed moment.      The next time a bank or payment processor tries to pull a similar stunt, they will be sure to think long and hard about the consequences.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT,David Z.

42376319,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7vj,1629904494,"Inside Alien Worlds, the Biggest Game in the Metaverse","Alien Worlds is the fastest growing game in blockchain and one of the biggest dapps overall, according to DappRadar.      Two of its co-founders are Sarojina McKenna and Michael Yeates, who both worked on the EOS blockchain previously. They were part of the team that worked closely with the micronation Liberland. Their work with Liberland, a tiny 8-square-kilometer nation on the banks of the Danube River, was to examine how to install a system of governance on one the world’s newest nations using blockchain and the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization, or a DAO. Now they are taking that knowledge to the metaverse in the guise of a game.    Jillian Godsil is an award-winning journalist, author and broadcaster. Her latest book is ""Persons of Interest.""    Alien Worlds, which lives on the Ethereum, WAX and Binance Smart Chain blockchains, is a metaverse spread over seven planets and at its core is the concept of not one but six competing DAOs. The game uses non-fungible tokens, and inhabitants mine for the game’s cryptocurrency trilium, much like the game currency AXS from the popular Axie Infinity game. Both currencies can then be exchanged for fiat. The goal is planetary mastery through staking and accessing higher-value features.    Read more: How Axie Infinity Creates Work in the Metaverse | Leah Callon-Butler    To McKenna, Alien Worlds is much more than a play-to-earn vehicle. Alien Worlds is converting people to mass adoption of crypto through strategy and governance, she says. It’s like sneaking extra shredded vegetables into children’s dinners – they don’t even know they are eating it. Likewise, the gamers have no idea that they are building something much bigger than mined trilium on a planet in a galaxy far, far away.      Launched last year, the free game gives gamers an opportunity to earn the local currency by mining, battling other explorers, going on quests or from receiving rental commission from their land. Digital items are created as NFTs and can be avatars such as the Stealth Mercenary for fighting or tools like the Artunian Shovel for mining.      It happened quite quickly and then some. First of all, Alien Worlds was the first game on blockchain to break through 100,000 users, then one million users, then two million. Now it’s surging at 2.5 million users. It is literally limitless.      “Metaverses are the new social media – where people will come to socialize,” says McKenna. “We have given them a world, or rather worlds, where people can come together and talk about what they want to do and achieve. And the competitive element between the planets makes for interesting conjecture.”      Alien Worlds allows people to earn trilium. Holding trilium gives players a strategic advantage in the game. Trilium can also be cashed out, and there are many videos on YouTube showing you how to do that, but McKenna is less interested in that aspect. This is definitely about the hidden vegetable approach.      “We created our metaverse, which is a boundary in space, divided into seven planets. When people land on these digital worlds, they use NFTs to mine the fungible token, trilium,” she says.      Entry is simple: Players need to get a WAX wallet and go to play.alienworlds.io and it’s free. There are no private and public keys. Players then head out to where they’d like to mine. The land has already been sold to more than 3,400 users, but it’s possible to rent land to mine in order to earn trilium. Choices are made at this stage as different land yields more returns, NFTs have different strengths and so on.      On the WAX planets, people mine trilium, on the BinanceChain planet, they go on missions – the different blockchains offer different gaming mechanisms, and more will be added over time.      “You’ve got to pick your strategy,"" McKenna says.      That also applies to how long you want to stay in the game. McKenna points out that some people like to be there all the time, others pop in and out, and so picking the right strategy is important.      “Some tools give a bigger payout, and if you only dip in and out, you need those ones. Right now, it’s just mining, but we are building fighting scenarios, too, where you can send in your minions and weapons and challenge another player to a battle,"" McKenna says.      As McKenna explains the setup, she also points out all the data is on blockchains and so it is transparent.      “The smart contracts and data are visible, so players can see which parts of the metaverse are attracting the most attention. People can offer gaming contracts and already have, hosting their own mini competitions. That’s what excites us – the metaverse taking on a life of its own,"" she says.      The community has set up its own Telegram channels, discord channels and websites. There are conversations happening off-planet and in the metaverse, and this is where McKenna sees the most febrile innovation occurring.      “Each planet is competitive to the others and each planet has its own DAO,” she says.      Now we are getting to the nub. This is not just a game to mine trilium, this is a game to mine trilium and stake it to a particular planet. The six planets are competing for the scarce trilium; the bigger the planet (the more users, the more trilium staked), the more trilium it attracts in daily inflation.      From there, the planets can get a bigger treasury and more control over their planet. In time, adherents of each planet will be able to amend the code base and change the rules of the game. Governance is gamified.      Initially, a starter constitution template is passed down, much in the same way as the Ten Commandments is, with certain permission thresholds. But over time, users will be able to scratch away at the rules and instate their own.      There is only ever going to be a 10 billion trilium – which is a conceptual figure that will never be reached as it operates on a declining inflation rate over time. Five billion is the amount expected to be created, and that will be shared with the players through the rewards system.      All the trilium goes first to the planets and is then shared by games or by mining and using a complex system of algorithms and calculations, in conjunction with the different NFTs, to determine final values. It is complex, but there is a blueprint, open source, of course, for anyone who wants to read it.    Vegetables    Back to the hidden vegetables or how we bring DAOs to the public. Once the planet DAOs are fully open for governance, then they vote in councilors. Councilors vote on-chain to release the funds in the treasury to support different worker proposals that are submitted.      It’s a circle: Workers propose ideas, councilors vote on those proposals. Councilors can be voted in – and out. The funds could be spent to create new games or reward different tasks. A recent example was a writer looking to create more lore for the game and to receive rewards for his work.      Or planets could vote to compete with other planets and strategize on how to extract more trilium.      “The landowners will in time also probably group as a governance contingent as their interests will be similar,"" McKenna says.      While the land is already purchased, as it is the real world, it can be bought and sold by players.      So while trilium can be earned through mining and other games and cashed out, McKenna thinks there will be more interest in staking the token and influencing the direction of the planet in the metaverse.

42376303,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7cr,1629904211,Pyth Launch to Bring Quant Firms’ Market Data to Solana,"Pyth Network – a key trading data pipeline set to service decentralized finance (DeFi) projects on Solana – will go live on Thursday.      Known as an “oracle” in crypto lingo, the data distributor will shortly begin pumping price quotes for crypto assets, FX markets, futures and equities into nodes supporting the Solana blockchain. There, developers can use it to build DeFi tools like lending projects.      At least 17 market makers, quant shops and exchanges had pledged to support Pyth, including one of Solana blockchain’s big backers, the crypto exchange FTX.      Jump Trading, Cumberland, LMAX, Virtu Financial and Genesis are also in the mix; late-comer quant firm Hudson River Trading joined Monday.      Pyth is looking to those straight-from-the-source data streams for an advantage in the oracle competition. Whereas older DeFi chains such as Ethereum have robust data distribution networks, Solana’s scene is more nascent; Chainlink on Solana isn't even in testnet yet. (Chainlink released a testnet for Solana developers early Wednesday.)    High-frequency arms race    Jump Trading’s Mike Cahill said Pyth’s “first-party” professional data is more trustworthy than third-party data aggregation protocols.      “It could be that there's people out there – freelancers – who are just screen-scraping to get the data,” Cahill said. “What Pyth does is it gives us an undisputed and legal source of data.”      Cahill said Pyth’s data partners send their ticks directly to Solana nodes, allowing price updates every 400 milliseconds (Solana’s blocktime). That’s far speedier than Ethereum’s blocktime of 10-15 seconds, which serves as a natural speed cap to the largest DeFi network’s on-chain oracles, according to Chainlink.      “This is about as fast as you can get” with a blockchain, Cahill said.      Even so, 400 milliseconds feels slothlike against the high-frequency trade times deployed by firms like those feeding data into Pyth, including Jump, which heavily assisted in Pyth’s development. They make billions of dollars by executing orders in millionths of a second.      “Historically, trading firms would just trade on exchanges, and would typically be consumers of market data,” Cahill said, explaining how Pyth allows Jump, Virtu and Hudson River to be “in the kind of data-selling seat” for the first time.      Using that data will be free-of-charge – to begin with, at least. Chi Zhao, an external spokesperson for Pyth, said it's “anticipated” that there could be monetization potential down the road. Monetization decisions would be up to “Pyth Governance,” she said.      But details surrounding Pyth’s governance model remained murky at press time Wednesday (Pyth’s website said a white paper is “coming soon”), raising the uncommon prospect of a mainnet launch before a backend reveal. Zhao said the white paper is under development.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | PYTH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/25/pyth-launch-to-bring-quant-firms-market-data-to-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42b7a2f0a1f1e4e1a81aafd1efb6adf5a2634b31-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376310,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7j9,1629902891,Privacy Startup Nym Hires Whistleblower Chelsea Manning to Audit Mixnet,"Whistleblower and security engineer Chelsea Manning has joined privacy startup Nym as a security consultant, focusing on auditing their mixnet.      A mix network or “mixnet” (taking its name from the proxy servers it employs, called “mixes”) obscures the metadata left behind when data passes through a network, providing a higher level of privacy when it comes to network-level surveillance.      Manning’s audit will be completed before the Nym network launches on mainnet later in the year.      “As methods for network traffic analysis have dramatically improved in the last decade, I have frequently called for research (since 2016) into alternative methods to Tor that avoid exposing the data within the network to such analysis,” Manning said in a statement. “Nym is one such viable alternative worthy of research and developmental implementation.”    Read more: Privacy Startup Nym Will Pay You in Bitcoin to Run Its Mixnet    Manning was imprisoned for leaking documentation regarding military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which included the U.S. targeting of civilians.      Nym’s ​initial testnet, launched in April 2020, was the victim of a Sybil attack. A Sybil attack is when a single actor tries to take over a network by spinning up multiple nodes that validate data and transactions on the network. If one actor has a disproportionate amount of control over the system, it compromises the system’s underlying integrity because the nodes under the attacker’s control could refuse to receive or transmit blocks on a blockchain.      “While trusting software with their money is one thing people are learning to do with Bitcoin and DeFi, brave whistleblowers and revolutionaries like Chelsea Manning have to trust software with their lives,” Nym CEO Harry Halpin said in a statement, adding:    “So rather than ‘YOLO’ and launch only to wreck their users, we’re working with the best people alive to keep our users safe and secure.”    Over the next month, Manning is tasked with discovering new privacy leaks and setting parameters for “cover traffic” on Nym’s mixnet. Cover traffic is traffic that can help confuse an internet service provider or other centralized entity that can attempt network-level surveillance.      Building on joint research with École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Manning is working on parameters for cover traffic that help protect Nym against statistical disclosure attacks, Halpin told CoinDesk.      A statistical disclosure attack is when adversaries watch a network and can determine who is online at “roughly the same time” and then use that information to de-anonymize transactions.      ""This attack also works on Tor,” said Halpin. “Let's say you hypothesize I send messages to a reporter even over Tor with a chat app like ‘Off the Record Messaging.’ If the reporter is regularly online and using Tor to chat me, and we're both online together at the same time, maybe it won't get caught by an adversary the first time, but it will eventually get caught.""      Halpin said he was pleasantly surprised to discover Manning is keeping track of research into post-quantum cryptography.

The Fed, as part of its post-coronavirus economic recovery efforts, has been buying $120 billion a month of bonds to provide stimulus to traditional financial markets.      Per Reuters, New York-based Goldman Sachs now sees the probability of a formal November announcement at 45%, versus a previous forecast of 25%. The odds of the tapering happening in December were cut to 35% from 55%.      The investment bank predicts that the Fed will taper the stimulus by $15 billion per month, starting from November. Each month, the Fed would reduce purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds by $10 billion and purchases of mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion, the research note said. The upward revision comes days before the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual Jackson Hole symposium, where Chair Jerome Powell is expected to strike a dovish tone, considering the resurgence of the Delta variant.      The central bank has been buying at least $80 billion a month in Treasuries and $40 billion in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities since March 2020 to counter the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.      These Fed liquidity injections set off the global macro trade of selling dollars and buying everything denominated in dollars, leading to unprecedented inflation of asset prices.      Bitcoin, for one, ended 2020 with 300% gains, setting new record highs near $40,000. The cryptocurrency remained big in the first four months of this year, reaching a lifetime high of $64,801. At the going price of $47,800, bitcoin is still up over 300% year-on-year.      Should the Federal Reserve's liquidity tap go dry, bitcoin and other asset prices could give up at least part of the stellar gains chalked out over the past 1.5 years.      ""Historically, that has been a headwind for bitcoin,"" Charlie Morris, CIO at ByteTree Asset Management, told CoinDesk in WhatsApp chat. ""In past cycles, both the anticipation and start of tapering have tightened monetary conditions, boosting the dollar in the process.""      ""When QE stopped in 2014, bitcoin died for a while. Then in 2018, when the actual taper came about, it was killed again,"" Morris noted in the market analysis published on Aug. 23.

Commissions from crypto trading were $264.2 million in the second quarter, compared with $11.2 million in the second quarter a year ago.  The share that crypto represented of total trading commissions increased to 73% this past quarter, compared with just 7% during the same period last year. XRP brought in the most commissions out of any crypto assets, while bitcoin had the most trading volume.  The company's total trading commissions were $362 million, and net trading income was $290 million. The company, however, posted a net loss of $89 million because of a non-cash charge of $71 million in stock-based compensation for eToro employees and a $36 million transaction cost related to its future merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) FinTech Acquisition Corp. V.  In May, eToro announced that it plans to go public via the merger, which values the combined company at $10.4 billion.

The draft regulations look to prohibit crypto custodians from extracting benefits from their clients' assets. Under the rules, digital asset custodians can't use one client's assets for the benefit of someone else, nor can they use it for their own benefit, such as lending the digital assets for interest.  Crypto custodians could deposit a client's assets only at a commercial bank and would have to agree on the interest rate with their client.  Under the rules, the crypto custodians would have to close clients' accounts every business day to ensure that client assets are accounted for and not used for someone else's benefit.

Vast’s total assets at the end of the first quarter were $783 million. By comparison, JP Morgan Chase, the nation's largest bank by assets, has $3.2 trillion in assets.      In February, Vast Bank began allowing some customers to buy cryptocurrencies with money from their bank accounts , and now customers will be able to see their crypto account balances together with their fiat account balances.      Taking advantage of interpretative letters from former Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks last year, the bank has chosen to be the custodian of their customers' cryptocurrency while Coinbase acts as the exchange.      Vast also serves crypto companies, which have historically struggled to gain traditional bank accounts and often aim to have multiple banking relationships to store and move their users’ fiat currencies.      New crypto features are likely to be added to the app alongside the purchasing option, Scrivner said.      “We have already been doing some things on the lending side in terms of looking at a legal review,” Scrivner said. “There’s lending against crypto as collateral. We would probably start with bitcoin and ETH.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/25/this-tiny-oklahoma-bank-is-allowing-customers-to-buy-crypto-on-its-mobile-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5526cb0eaeb49dcd467291ee0ad9e0fa624ba26-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The arrangement, announced Wednesday, further strengthens Coinbase’s position in Germany, where it recently became the first company to win a crypto custody license from the country’s financial regulator, BaFIN.      Solarisbank, which also has a crypto custody license pending, holds a banking license in Germany, making the fintech firm a nice fit for a crypto exchange.      “As a regulated institution, Coinbase needed a partner to help identify customers, compliant with the AML laws in Germany,” Delia König, Managing Director Identity at Solarisbank, said in an interview. “We were in touch quite early on and showed them what our suite of KYC methods was capable of.”      Coinbase is the first crypto exchange to use Solarisbank’s KYC platform, which is also used by the likes of Samsung Pay, König said, adding that it’s unfortunate that KYC regulations in Europe are not really harmonized, making it a struggle for many companies.      The go-to method in Germany and many other places for KYC is video identification, where a user talks to an agent in a video chat and shows their ID card. Coinbase will also use Solarisbank’s “Bankident” solution, which does not require face-to-face interaction with a physical agent.      “Bankident lets you identify based on an existing account that you have, such as an account with Deutsche Bank,” König said. “You are basically logging into the bank, and when you initiate a transaction, we make sure you have been already identified for this account before and with that your KYC is valid.”      König pointed out that having a banking license makes Solarisbank a safe bet for Coinbase going forward.      “We have to fulfill the same obligations and audits as a bank, which played a big role,” she said. “And for sure, we wouldn’t say no to more collaborations with Coinbase on other projects.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/25/coinbase-strengthens-in-germany-with-solarisbanks-kyc-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d37b86997836d40496cc7ab6947033b0c5e0d904-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.    New frontiers: Ethereum is coming of age    One of the first articles I wrote about Ethereum for CoinDesk was headlined “Unstoppable Scams? Ethereum’s Gambling Problem Is Only Getting Worse.”      At the time, in the late summer of 2018, Ethereum’s most popular decentralized applications (dapps), outpacing even the incumbent CryptoKitties gaming dapp, were gambling dapps that closely resembled Ponzi schemes. LastWinner, a clone copy of another infamous gambling dapp called FOMO 3D, had raised over $7 million in ETH from users within the span of a week and was eating up one-third of Ethereum’s total computational power, also called hashrate.      Meanwhile, the biggest headline news about Bitcoin were the pending decisions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on two bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications put forth by ProShares.      As Ethereum attracted retail users and scammers looking to make a quick buck, it seemed the majority of investors and traders serious about adopting cryptocurrencies for a mass audience were focused on Bitcoin.      In many respects, market infrastructure for and regulatory awareness about bitcoin has paved the way for cryptocurrencies like ether to follow.      For example, the classification of being a commodity rather than security in the eyes of the SEC was first granted to bitcoin in 2018 and then for ether in 2019. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Canada were first approved for bitcoin then for ether. Crypto custody bank Anchorage Digital started its lending service with bank-grade, bitcoin-backed loans and only recently expanded its offerings to include ether-backed loans through an FDIC-insured bank this summer.      However, trends are changing, and evidence is mounting to suggest that Ethereum has finally either caught up to or surpassed Bitcoin across a number of key metrics, even as other smart contract blockchains such as Cardano and Solana show promising signs of real adoption and value.    Key metrics    For starters, Ethereum is surpassing Bitcoin in total value transferred on-chain. Using Coin Metrics’ adjusted transaction volume estimates, so far in August $185 billion worth of ETH has been moved on Ethereum while only $180 billion of BTC has exchanged hands on Bitcoin. The last time Ethereum passed Bitcoin in monthly transfer volume was in May 2021.      Every month since June 2020, users have been paying more in fees to send transactions on Ethereum than Bitcoin. In 2021 alone, total fees in dollar terms on Ethereum were four times higher than Bitcoin, suggesting demand for block space on Ethereum is outpacing demand for block space on Bitcoin.      Aside from on-chain metrics, spot market metrics such as the Puell Multiple, historically used to measure the relative value of new coins being mined on a proof-of-work blockchain, suggests the profit-taking opportunities for investors holding ETH have been greater than those for investors holding BTC almost consistently for the past 15 months.      As a result, trade activity for ETH-USD pairs have surpassed or come close to surpassing that of BTC-USD pairs. For the first time ever, aggregated monthly trade volume in the ETH spot markets surpassed that of the BTC spot markets in May; so far in August, trade volumes for ETH are about 90% of the volumes being seen for BTC. This suggests market interest in ETH is trending as high as BTC.      There are also telltale signs in the cryptocurrency derivatives market of a shift in market sentiment placing Ethereum in the same rankings as, if not more bullish rankings than, Bitcoin. According to Alexander Blum, managing director of digital asset investment fund Two Prime, the technical and fundamental measures he uses to evaluate digital assets are beginning to show him that ether is a more promising investment than bitcoin.      “How much people are willing to pay for bitcoin or ether one or three months out into the future is a good sense of the market sentiment around where things are going,” said Blum in an interview with CoinDesk. The “future premium you pay for ether is close to 10%, whereas for bitcoin it’s right around 7% to 8% right now and the amount of calls being bought out into the future is more skewed to the upside on ether than bitcoin.”      Institutions and professional investors that got involved in the crypto industry because of their interest in bitcoin are getting serious about their interest in ether, too, and, more importantly, they are beginning to value ether as a unique investment separate from bitcoin.    Key competitors to Ethereum    Although Ethereum has the first-mover advantage of being the first general purpose, smart contract blockchain in the world, there are a number of up-and-coming competitors gaining user adoption and market value.      Binance Smart Chain, Cardano and Solana are just a few of the platforms that have made headlines this year for wildly popular decentralized applications (dapps) or outlandish token returns of over 1,000% year to date in some cases.      As important as measuring these competitor networks by their potential is through evaluating their developer teams, white papers and roadmaps, it’s equally important to put their performance and current progress into perspective with the metrics used to evaluate the top cryptocurrencies of the industry.      As of Aug. 24, 2021, 24-hour trade volume for the native tokens of the Cardano (ADA), Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Solana (SOL) blockchains combined barely exceed half the daily trade volume for ETH. Public data around total value transferred on-chain for these three networks is scarce and regulated derivatives products for ADA, BSC and SOL are almost non-existent.      Other important metrics specific to evaluating the performance of smart contract blockchains include number of dapps, total value locked in dapps and number of active dapp users. For some networks such as Cardano, smart contract functionality to support the development of dapps has yet to be launched. For others such as Binance Smart Chain and Solana that do have smart contract functionality, the total value locked in dapps is multiples lower than the value locked in Ethereum dapps.      As bitcoin paved the way in many respects for the institutional adoption and awareness of cryptocurrencies broadly, the increasing awareness of ether’s use case and design raises the profiles of competing assets and propels investment in their continued development.      This in turn fuels innovation through market competition in smart contract blockchain technology, which presents opportunities for alternative networks to Ethereum to shine and steal market share even as Ethereum continues to evolve.      In an industry like crypto where little is established and much is fueled by speculation, the rise of Ethereum over the past six years stands as an example for how quickly user adoption and institutional interest can catch fire, challenging the status quo.    Validated takes  Ethereum’s most popular software client, Geth, has issued a hotfix to a high severity security issue in their code. BACKGROUND: All users were encouraged to upgrade immediately to the latest version of Geth, v.1.10.8. The last time a fix for a bug in Geth code was released to users, it caused a temporary chain split on Ethereum due to a lack of communication between Geth developers and users about the urgency of the upgrade.  Crypto investment firm Paradigm helped mitigate a potential $350 million bug in decentralized exchange SushiSwap’s launchpad code. BACKGROUND: Paradigm is a well-known investor in Uniswap, the original exchange that inspired the creation of SushiSwap. Paradigm Research Partner Sam Sun identified a vulnerability in SushiSwap code that could have allowed hackers to drain users’ funds from the exchange. Sun disclosed his findings with the SushiSwap team, pulling off one of the biggest whitehat rescues ever in the crypto industry.  Visa announced that it bought a CryptoPunk NFT on Monday, spending roughly $150,000 on the digital art piece. BACKGROUND: Visa’s head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, said in a blog post that the main purpose behind the purchase was to learn more about the growing non-fungible token market. ""We think NFTs will play an important role in the future of retail, social media, entertainment and commerce,"" Sheffield wrote.  $1.5 million has been awarded to Ethereum software client teams such as Besu, Erigon, Geth, Nethermind and Nimbus. BACKGROUND: These client teams build the software that enable users and businesses to connect to the Ethereum network. The grant money was donated by Compound Grants, Kraken, Lido, Synthetix, The Graph and Uniswap Grants.  Decentralized exchange (DEX) volume is projected to hit around $80 billion for the month of August. BACKGROUND: June and July showed slowing trading volume, but August is on pace to be the second-best month in DEX history. EIP 1559, a revival in governance tokens and an emerging cross-chain ecosystem have helped bring positive sentiment back into the decentralized finance market this month.  Ether price and active sending addresses have started to diverge over the past week in a way that suggests bearish price trends to follow. BACKGROUND: The number of active addresses on Ethereum is usually a leading indicator on ETH price. While prices have increased 4.87% over the last seven days, the number of active addresses has dropped 5.50% over the same time period.

42397018,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYNFh,1629889219,"ADA, SOL Lead the Way as Crypto Market Sees Price Pullback","The crypto market is a sea of red, with Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA tokens and other alternative cryptocurrencies taking a bigger hit than bitcoin and ether. The move seems typical of a breather often observed after notable rallies.      ADA was trading at $2.67 at 10:53 UTC, representing a 7.6% drop on a 24-hour basis, and SOL was nursing a 13% loss at $68, according to data source Messari. ADA debuted on Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges today. Earlier this month, Sebastien Guillemot, CTO at dcSpark and a former executive of Cardano-founding entity EMURGO, hailed ADA's entry to Japan as being similar to a listing on Coinbase, the U.S.-based, Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange and institutions' preferred avenue to accumulate bitcoin.      XRP, polkadot and dogecoin were also down more than 8%. Meanwhile, bitcoin was changing hands at $47,500, down 3.7%, and ether traded 5.5% lower at $3,100, CoinDesk 20 data show. All sub-sectors, including decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, were flashing red.      According to analytics platform Laevitas, alternative cryptocurrencies were looking ripe for a pullback as holding long positions in many of the coins had become too costly. ""Paying over 100% annualized for longs can't be sustained forever,"" Laevitas tweeted, adding that the price drop looks like a healthy correction.      Some of the coins like ADA and SOL looked overbought, having recently rallied to record highs and outperformed bitcoin by a significant margin. For instance, ADA had rallied 187% and SOL 272% in the past four weeks, more than twice as much as bitcoin's 70%.      ""The duo of Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) has seen a meteoric rise in price and valuation lately, with both printing new all-time highs at $2.97 and $81.81 respectively,"" Pavel Shkitin, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Nominex.io said. ""Despite the superiority in both tokens' technologies, the surge in the past days is somewhat unprecedented, and the current reversal is an expected reaction.""      James Wo, founder, and CEO of the Digital Finance Group said it is normal for investors to reduce exposure and take profits to enter at a lower price since we've seen the market signal that a short-term top was reached.      Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, looked due for a pause on Wednesday, with exchanges seeing an increased inflow of coins amid renewed selling by whales.      Similar dynamics were observable in Ethereum's ether token. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, exchanges received 779,880 ETH on Monday, the most since June 21st. ""Judging by on-chain data, it might be a whale possibly looking to take some profits,"" Santiment said in a research note published Tuesday.      Analysts remain confident of major cryptocurrencies' long-term prospects. Laurent Kssis, managing director of exchange-traded products at 21Shares, foresees a return of institutional demand to the bitcoin market after Friday's Jackson Hole Symposium.      Nominex.io's Shkitin expects the so-called Ethereum killers ADA and SOL to regain their upward trajectory. ""With what Cardano, through its forthcoming Alonzo upgrade, is set to usher in and Solana’s blooming fundamentals, these price drops are at best temporary, and a reversal is imminent in the near to mid-term,"" he said.

The report by Allied Market Research published Tuesday projects a compound annual growth rate of 12.8% between 2021 and 2030.  The main drivers will be increased demand for international remittances and more transparency in global payments systems, Allied Market said.  More than two-thirds of the industry's 2020 size was attributable to the mining segment, which is expected to retain this position of dominance through 2030.  However, the transaction segment will see the fastest growth, the report found.  Allied Market forecast that the Asia-Pacific crypto industry will be the fastest growing because of increased competition from a growing number of exchanges.  The report largely echoes of another recent study by the same company into the crypto asset-management market, which it projects will grow to $9.4 billion in 2030 from $670 million in 2020. That also identified Asia-Pacific as the region for the most significant growth because of the large numbers of crypto mining enterprises there, driving demand for asset-management products and services to help manage their business processes.

Income from play-to-earn crypto games such as Axie Infinity should be taxed, the Manila Bulletin reported Monday, citing Undersecretary of Finance Antonette C. Tionko.  Tionko said that whether Axie Infinity tokens are assets or securities is being discussed by the country's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and central bank.  The undersecretary also said that although the game's Vietnamese creator, Sky Mavis, is not registered in the Philippines, it must pay taxes in the country for any revenue created through local sources.  The SEC reiterated that the game and its publisher are not registered in the Philippines, and that Sky Mavis doesn't have a license to sell securities, the Manila Bulletin said yesterday.  In response to the regulators' statements, Sky Mavis co-Founder and COO Aleksander Leonard Larsen told CoinDesk in a message on Thursday that ""Axie Infinity does not sell SLP or provide liquidity on the market,"" and that the tokens are only earned by playing the game or acquired from other players.  Inspired by Pokémon, Axie Infinity has players battle using NFT anime monsters, called Axies. When they win, the earn SLP tokens, which they can then exchange for fiat currency. Players can also sell their Axies on NFT marketplaces.  Some people ""set up scholarships, or companies, then they hire other players to work for them,"" Larsen said.

About 37% of the investors confessed non-liquidation of their crypto holdings even for important bills or other payments. However, there&apos;s this discovery that Elon Musk has a great influence on the crypto-related decisions of most respondents. A survey of 1,000 US crypto investors by GamblersPick, a betting platform, displayed a shocking revelation. 37% of these holders won&apos;t dispose of their assets irrespective of the circumstance. Furthermore, 51% confirmed that luxury purchases wouldn&apos;t be too enticing for them to opt for cash out. Also, the survey took a critical examination of the different generations of crypto investors. It reveals that the Baby boomer and Generation Z groups have the largest and the least investment in cryptocurrency, respectively. In addition, the male forks have more interest in digital investment than women, with an average of $1,940 worth of cryptocurrencies.

Whether it&apos;s cave paintings or colossal sculptures that have become synonymous with culture and identity, humans have long sought to express themselves through creativity. And increasingly, we&apos;re all seeking to express ourselves digitally in an increasingly noisy and chaotic world — some of us more than others. People want to stand out from the crowd and make their mark in a way that is meaningful and resonates with them on a deep level. At the same time, we want to make our mark on the world with land ownership and the ability to build a legacy. Land is one of those scarce resources that people want to own, with its intrinsic value as a medium for expressing oneself. The same goes for digital art — it&apos;s an invaluable form of expression, but also one that can be replicated and shared freely by anyone who has access to it. So far, so good — except most digital art isn&apos;t actually owned by its creators, because it exists in centralized servers controlled by private corporations or governments. This is why we need decentralized applications: they provide a way for people to own their data and have control over what happens to it. In short: decentralization equals true ownership. It&apos;s only through the use of NFTs that we can take back ownership of our online identities and experiences from these corporate giants.
