42381987,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNft,1559081141,MakerDAO Finally Approves DAI Fee Decrease After 11-Day Deliberation,"After nearly two weeks of continuous voting, MakerDAO token holders have officially activated a decrease to DAI stablecoin fees.  DAI is an ethereum-based token which presently maintains a soft peg to the U.S. dollar. In recent months, fees have increased dramatically for users to loan out DAI from the MakerDAO system. This was because since as early as February DAI dollar valuation had consistently fluctuated below the targeted $1.00 mark.  This month DAI dollar valuation has stabilized considerably and is now trading on major cryptocurrency exchanges at or around $1.00.  At present, there is over $400 million worth of ether backing a supply of roughly 80 million DAI. This makes MakerDAO by far the most popular decentralized financial application in the crypto space at present, according to DeFi Pulse.  For the past two weeks, MakerDAO token holders have been debating whether or not a decrease to DAI lending fees – called the Stability Fee – should be issued into the system given a steady dollar valuation. The last successful effort to decrease the fee took place in late December of last year.  At first, two token holders dominated an initial governance vote collectively staking 54,000 MKR in favor of a 2 percent Stability Fee decrease. This decision was reaffirmed the next week when more than 9 token holders again voted for the same 2 percent decrease.  However, both times the vote was not ratified in a secondary round of voting – called the executive vote – which requires token holders to reach a minimum threshold of votes greater than the amount staked in the previous round of executive voting.  The last successful executive vote initiating a two percent increase to the Stability Fee was ratified into the system with a total of 35,221.95 MKR staked in favor. Today's executive vote initiating a two percent decrease was activated with a total of 89,926.75 MKR staked.

42381985,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNed,1559073631,"Car-Racing Crypto Collectable Sells for Over $100,000 In Ether Tokens","A pseudonymous blockchain bidder named ""09E282"" has apparently paid over $113,000 worth of the cryptocurrency wrapped ether for a token tied to a virtual Formula 1 race car.  According to data from Etherscan, the winning bid capped a four-day auction that ended May 27 at 6:49 AM UTC in which around 15 bidders submitted 40 competing bids for the crypto collectable.  Why this happened is still unclear but it seems that someone out there wanted a totally buffed virtual car for a game that the company claims is an ""officially-licensed Formula 1 game.""  The racing game is called F1 Delta Time and was made by Animoca Brands, a company that licenses popular characters and properties and builds mobile games around them. F1 Delta Time is a ""blockchain-based"" title that bears the official seal of approval from the company that controls the Formula 1 races.  The car was the first product available for in-game purchase – in this case, via an outside auction – and apparently owning this vehicle is worth over $100,000 to someone out there. Besides, this car is overpowered to the max, bruh!  From GTPlanet:    Why would anyone spend that much money on a virtual car in an unreleased racing game that few people know anything about? While NFT-based cryptocurrency games like F1 Delta Time are interesting and exciting new ways to use blockchain, this investment is so outrageously bizarre that it seems almost suspicious.      Was Animoco just using this auction to build publicity around its new game? Could some wealthy F1 fan with a penchant for cryptocurrency speculation really have spent $100,000 on the 1-1-1?    After the 2017 rise of CryptoKitties, which saw people paying as much as six figures for a virtual pet, it's perhaps not all that surprising that a non-fungible token (NFT) representing an imaginary racecar, created on ethereum using the same ERC-721 standard, would sell for so much. The transaction, for what its worth, is recorded here according to Etherscan.  Whether this was a stunt, a mistake, or the start of a new – albeit odd – market is anyone's guess. We've put in a request for comment regarding this shiny virtual vehicle.

42381976,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNTJ,1559068879,Tezos Is About to Enact Its First-Ever On-Chain Blockchain Update,"After nearly three months of voting by token holders, the Tezos blockchain will undertake a series of backwards-incompatible changes to the network on Wednesday.  Called Athens A, the upgrade proposal was the first to undergo the network’s “self-amendment” process in which bakers on Tezos – equivalent to miners on bitcoin or ethereum – stake tokens bundled into “rolls” to show their support for or against competing upgrade proposals. Tezos is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain with an estimated valuation of over $1 billion.  Teeing up this week's event, a developer group known as Nomadic Labs kick-started Tezos’ first on-chain governance process back in February. At the time, the news was a notable given the turbulence that took place during the project's early days.  As reported in March, Nomadic Labs put forward two proposals: Athens A and Athens B. Athens A and Athens B both suggested an increase to the computation or gas limit of Tezos blocks. This would effectively make smart contract deployment easier for application developers building atop the platform.  Athens A, on the other hand, also suggested a reduction to the minimum amount of tokens – called a roll size – that's required for a user to become a baker. This would reduce the barrier to entry for baking and encourage a higher number of bakers on the Tezos blockchain.  After three months of voting and testing, bakers have now officially passed the final voting threshold to activate Athens A on Tezos' main network.  As noted by Jacob Arluck from the Tocqueville Group – a for-profit business development entity funded by the Tezos Foundation – bakers actually passed this last round of voting last Tuesday with over 46,000 rolls cast.  Now, Athens A is expected to be activated on the main network sometime tomorrow on block number 458,752.  Styles of on-chain governance  Tezos' final voting phase – called the promotion period – required a minimum participation level of at least 81.39 percent of all Tezos rolls. In addition, a supermajority of these rolls needed to be staked in favor of activating Athens A on the mainnet.  Contending that the voter turnout for this first governance process on Tezos is “the highest for any system like this,” Arluck said:  “It’s not like MakerDAO or Aragon where a whale can just control everything easily...It’s not purely a bunch of whales voting in our system. It’s people voting on behalf of a very large number of people.”  So-called ""whale voters"" have been a contentious issue for other blockchain projects and their systems of on-chain governance. For the past few weeks, programmatic loan system MakerDAO have been seeing one to two large token holders dictating the outcome of their governance polls.  While governance polls don’t have any impact on changes to the MakerDAO system, they do initiate executive polling rounds in which the same token holders vote continuously to either activate or ignore a change into the system.  In addition, the most recent voting round for the ethereum-based governance platform Aragon presented token holders with nine different proposals.  At least two of them, according to blockchain analytics site Alethio, were ultimately passed and rejected as a result of the preferences of one voter with large token holdings. Four others went from a close decision to a landslide victory due to the backing of a single whale voter.  “One obvious danger of onchain governance is plutocracy. Unfortunately Aragon’s second vote was not even plutocracy. It was just governance by one whale,” wrote Evan Van Ness, the author of Week in Ethereum News newsletters, on May 2 regarding the Aragon governance outcomes.  'Still too much friction'  Like MakerDAO and Aragon, changes to the Tezos network are also ultimately determined by token holders.  However, according to Arluck, the defining difference of Tezos’ on-chain governance process is that token holders are required to either vote as a baker or delegate their assets to a baker in the system.  “In all these systems it’s whoever is paying attention votes. In our system we just have groups of people who are always paying attention because they’re baking,” Arluck told CoinDesk. “It solves the attention problem. It makes governance more scalable in terms of the number of people who can be represented in the system.”  As such, Arluck contends that even bakers with sizable token holdings – anywhere from between 3 to four percent of the token supply – are actually representative of many different users.  ""It's people voting on behalf of a very large number of people,"" said Arluck. ""[Bakers] only own 10 percent or maybe 20 percent of what they're showing...For the people delegating to them, if they don't like how they vote, they can delegate to other [bakers.]""  Still, Tezos by no means has on-chain governance entirely figured out.  Arluck highlights that many lessons were learnt during the Athens voting process that will likely inform how the voting process should change in future.  Speaking about the mechanism of on-chain governance on other blockchains like the recently launched Cosmos blockchain, Arluck told CoinDesk:  “There’s still too much friction to voting and to people signaling their preferences. In the future, I want us to be implementing...something like what Cosmos does with overriding [votes.]”  Correction: Both proposals – Athens A and Athens B – suggested an increase to the Tezos gas limit.

42381977,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNS3,1559062818,"IBM, Maersk Finally Sign Up 2 Big Carriers for Shipping Blockchain","Shipping blockchain TradeLens, developed by IBM and Maersk, has finally recruited two major marine cargo carriers to the platform after its early marketing efforts floundered.  The new additions are Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), the second largest after Maersk; and CMA-CGM, the fourth largest in terms of cargo carrying capacity.  MSC and CMA-CGM join other carriers Asia’s Pacific International Lines (PIL), Zim Integrated Shipping Services, and Maersk subsidiary Hamburg Süd, which, when combined, account for nearly half of the world’s ocean container cargo data, IBM said.  TradeLens also hosts over 100 supply chain operators from the shipping and freight forwarding world including port authorities, cargo owners and so on.  But the achievement of bringing a couple of Maersk’s very large rivals on to the IBM platform roughly a year after launch should not be underestimated in an industry with narrow margins for IT revamps and an inherent distrust among competitors.  Indeed, TradeLens experienced difficulties at first attracting rival carriers to the platform over concerns from some quarters that IBM and Maersk owned the intellectual property in a joint venture.  Still a joint venture  These concerns are somehow being addressed, but in such a way that did not come down to a matter of having to share actual ownership of the platform itself. According to an IBM spokeswoman:  “IBM and Maersk continue to be the sole owners of the TradeLens platform. The nature of an effective blockchain is to create an environment where multiple parties, often competitors, want to co-exist. Both CMA CGM and MSC are participating on the advisory board as part of the shared commitment to open governance.”  Marie Wieck, the general manager for IBM Blockchain, said Big Blue has simply stuck to its blockchain architectural principles of open source collaboration, emphasizing that everyone owns their own data and has the authorization to permit who gets to see that and what the privacy implications are.  Wieck told CoinDesk:  “They [carriers] they took a good hard look at this and saw the clear benefits of joining. This is real momentum that you are seeing in the market play out here. Now with CMA and MSC it really has reached a tipping point in terms of market maturity.”  CMA CGM and MSC will operate a blockchain node on the Hyperledger Fabric-based distributed ledger and participate in consensus to validate transactions. As such, the carriers will assume the critical role of acting as Trust Anchors, or validators, for the network. In addition, CMA CGM and MSC will be on the TradeLens Advisory Board to help promote the neutrality of the platform, said IBM.  Rajesh Krishnamurthy, executive vice president for IT and transformations at CMA CGM Group, said in a statement: “We believe that TradeLens, with its commitment to open standards and open governance, is a key platform to help usher in this digital transformation.TradeLens’ network is already showing that participants from across the supply chain ecosystem can derive significant value.”  André Simha, chief digital & information officer, MSC, added: “The TradeLens platform has enormous potential to spur the industry to digitize the supply chain and build collaboration around common standards.

42381973,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNPX,1559052695,Kik is Crowdfunding $5 Million in Crypto to Help Fight SEC,"Canada-based messaging app firm Kik has launched a crypto crowdfunding campaign to support a likely court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its 2017 initial coin offering (ICO).  Announced by Kik founder and CEO Ted Livingston and Patrick Gibbs, a partner at law firm Cooley LLP, on the UnChained Podcast Tuesday, the campaign is being launched in the hopes that ""a lawsuit would eventually result in a new Howey test for crypto tokens, to determine which ones are a security.""  A dedicated website – dubbed Defend Crypto – has already been set up allowing supporters to contribute to the fundraising effort, that its founders say is not only in support of Kik but many crypto firms that face potential action from the U.S. regulator. The site offers donation options in 19 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and XRP, as well as less standard options like augur (REP), DAI and, of course, Kik's kin (KIN) token.  While Kik maintains that its token is used as a currency, the SEC has expressed concerns that kin might be a security and the regulator may seek an enforcement action against the firm.  Indeed, SEC chairman Jay Clayton has previously said: “I believe every ICO I’ve seen is a security.” He added: “I want to go back to separating ICOs and cryptocurrencies. ICOs that are securities offerings, we should regulate them like we regulate securities offerings. End of story.”  On the new website, Kik states:  ""After months of trying to find a reasonable solution, Kin has been unable to reach a settlement that wouldn’t severely impact the Kin project and everyone in the space. So Kin is going to take on the SEC in court to make sure there is a foundation for innovation going forward.""  Arguing that the case would set a precedent for how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the U.S., Kik said the Defend Crypto campaign would help ensure the funds are in place ""to do this the right way."" The firm claims it's already spent over $5 million on the case and is now committing another $5 million in BTC, ETH, and KIN ""to fight this out on behalf of the industry.""  Noted crypto investor Fred Wilson indicated in a blog post that he's already donated to the cause, and said: ""It is my hope, and Kin’s hope, that DefendCrypto.org will be an inspiration for the many other important crypto projects that are silently battling with the SEC to come public and raise capital from the crypto sector for their fights.""  Kik is encouraging other supporters to fight this ""innovation tax"" by donating cryptos that will held in a Coinbase account and only be used once Kik's $5 million has been spent. Unused funds will be allocated to ""other initiatives.""  Livingston told CoinDesk earlier this month:  “In the last month alone, over a million people earned kin from 40 different apps, from 40 different companies. Over a quarter million people used kin, making it the most-used cryptocurrency in the world, and they’re not even willing to say that’s not a security.”  Kik image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/28/kik-is-crowdfunding-5-million-in-crypto-to-help-fight-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/013b1f1a8396248bcad385363c2819b8fb01528e-1500x1148.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A former banker, Lund harbored an ambitious plan to bring cryptocurrency into the enterprise world and also to explore stablecoins and central bank digital currency.  He spearheaded IBM’s World Wire payment network which used the Stellar blockchain to help banks remove pain points from cross border payments. Lund, previously a senior vice president of innovation at Wells Fargo, had enticed six banks onto the World Wire platform including Philippines-based RCBC, Brazil’s Banco Bradesco, and Bank Busan of South Korea.  The World Wire platform has payment locations in 72 countries, with 48 currencies and 46 “banking endpoints” (which include banks and money transmitters) where people can send or receive cash, IBM said in March.

Davenport has deep roots in technology and cryptocurrency. He founded Beluga, which was acquired by Facebook in 2011 and became Facebook Messenger. Then he joined BitGo, an early bitcoin startup providing security solutions, as a co-founder in 2014.  Davenport told CoinDesk that while he is a two-time founder, he's now spent more time investing than he has running his own startups, adding:  ""Focusing on the investment side allows me to spend more time focused on the industry as a whole, and how it's evolving, as opposed to being focused on the perspective of a single business.""  Davenport currently has stakes in more than 15 companies. As a venture partner, he won't be making decisions for Blockchain Capital as a full partner would. Instead, they'll be sharing deal flow and evaluating opportunities together, Davenport explained.  Davenport's crypto portfolio already includes Lightning Labs, Paxos, LedgerX and the Electric Coin Company, according to AngelList. He stepped down from BitGo in April 2018.  Davenport knows the Blockchain Capital partners, P. Bart Stephens and Spencer Bogart, originally as investors in BitGo.  ""I've known them to bring a thoughtful approach to investment, staying true to their convictions and not getting distracted by the flavor of the moment,"" Davenport said.  Stephens, co-founder and managing partner of the firm, told CoinDesk in an email that Davenport ""brings unparalleled technical knowledge and experience of the crypto ecosystem as the co-founder and CTO of BitGo"" and major entrepreneurial successes to his credit.  One of the longest-standing venture firms in the space, Blockchain Capital has raised four funds over the last six years, with investments in the major crypto companies like Coinbase, Circle, Ripple, Kraken and Block.one.

42381968,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qKY9,1559041201,Bitcoin Price Raises Bull Flag in Preparation for Possible Move Higher,"View  Bitcoin has formed a bull flag pattern on the hourly chart in the last 24 hours.  A break above $8,890 would confirm a bull flag breakout and create room for a rally to $9,940 (target as per the measured move method). On the way higher, BTC may face resistance at the key Fibonacci level of $9,442.  BTC confirmed a pennant breakout on Sunday. The hourly chart flag breakout, therefore, looks likely.  A close below the 10-day moving average (MA), currently at $8,193 would abort the short-term bullish outlook, although that looks unlikely in the short term.  The ongoing bitcoin (BTC) price consolidation below $9,000 looks bullish in nature and could end up fueling further gains, according to technical charts.  The world’s top cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading largely unchanged on the day at $8,720 on Bitstamp. Prices have been restricted to a narrow range of $8,940–$8,650 for more than 24 hours now.  The range-bound trading marks a weak follow-through to Sunday’s bullish close. The path of least resistance, however, remains to the upside with the price staying well above the former resistance-turned-support of $8,390.  Further, the price congestion has taken the shape of a technical pattern called a “bull flag” – a pause that often refreshes higher.  A break above the upper edge the flag, currently at $8,890, would confirm a flag breakout and accelerate the move toward $10,000.  Hourly chart  BTC has created a bull flag pattern following an upside break of a pennant pattern on Sunday.  A flag breakout, if confirmed, would create room for a rally to $9,940 (target as per the measured move method, i.e. pole height added to the breakout price).  The pennant breakout has already opened the doors to $10,000, as discussed yesterday.  On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at $9,942 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the December 2017 high to December 2018 low.  It is worth noting that the 50-, 100-, and 200-hour moving averages are trending north in favor of the bulls. The stacking order of the 50-hour MA, above the 100-hour MA, above the 200-hour MA is also a classic bull signal.  A flag breakout therefore, looks likely. The bullish MA studies also indicate that a flag breakdown (move below $8,620), if confirmed, could end up trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market.  Daily chart  The daily chart remains biased toward the bulls with the 5- and 10-day MAs trending north and the Chaikin money flow index printing positive – a sign of strong buying pressures.  Pullbacks, if any, will likely be reversed by the 5- and 10-day MAs, currently located at $8,454 and $8,193, respectively.

Specifically, the bank will use a blockchain platform to verify the items of proof required for credit lending, such as qualification or certification documents, Yonhap reported Monday.  Until now, customers had to submit these documents directly to the bank to undergo time-consuming manual verification of their authenticity, according to the report.  With the blockchain-based verification system, Shinhan is expecting to process these documents more quickly and at a lower cost.  The bank has reportedly already applied the technology to its ""Shinhan Doctors"" loan product, reducing the time taken to confirm whether a customer is a regular member of the Hospital Doctors' Council from two to three days to “real time.”  A Shinhan Bank official was quoted as saying in the report that the blockchain system is expected to boost the number of ""non-face-to-face"" loan products processed and that the bank plans to expand the system to more products.  Founded in 1897, Shinhan has been exploring blockchain technology for some time now. Last year, it trialed cross-border remittances for business customers using Ripple’s blockchain technology. As far as back in 2015, Shinhan invested around $427,000 in blockchain remittance startup Streami.  Editor's note: This article is based on a report translated from Korean.

42381959,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qKMp,1559034036,ECB Official Says Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency a 'Viable Option',"A European Central Bank (ECB) official has come out generally in favor of wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).  Vitas Vasiliauskas, a member of the Governing Council of the ECB and chairman of the board of the Bank of Lithuania, made the comments in a speech at a recent conference in the U.S., the text of which was published by the Bank of International Settlements on Monday.  Vasiliauskas said the question is whether CBDCs should be retail, wholesale, or both. A retail CBDC would be available for the general public, while a wholesale version would be restricted to serve a limited circle, mostly financial institutions. In between these two types, “multiple theoretical sub-models also exist,” the official said.  A wholesale CBDC could be used to improve payments and securities settlement efficiency, as well as to reduce counterparty credit and liquidity risks, Vasiliauskas said, adding:  “[A value-based wholesale CBDC] would replace or complement reserves at the central bank with a restricted-access digital token. A token would be a bearer asset, meaning that during the transaction the sender would transfer value to the receiver, without intermediaries. This is something fundamentally different from the current system in which the central bank debits and credits the accounts without transferring actual values.”  On the other hand, a retail CBDC could be either value-based or account-based, he said, adding that the former could resemble cash in digital form, guaranteed by central banks, while the latter could be in the form of an account at central banks, available to all members of the society.  However, the issue with retail CBDCs is that it has substitutes available and isn’t viable if one takes into consideration a cost-benefit analysis, Vasiliauskas said.  For instance, he said, the Bank of Lithuania already provides a payments infrastructure called Centrolink, which supports “24/7 instant payments” and is accessible for all payment service operators. “Such developments limit the potential added-value of the retail CBDC.""  “Therefore, assessing the balance between risks and benefits from the perspective of generally conservative central banks, the wholesale CBDC seems like a more viable option going forward,” Vasiliauskas added.  The official concluded that while the Bank of Lithuania sees potential in CBDCs, it currently remains “cautious.” “For now, this seems like quite a distant prospect,” he said.  Further, there is a need to gain a better theoretical understanding of how any type of CBDC would function and learn from practical pilot experiments, according to Vasiliauskas.

42381961,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qKO5,1559030424,JPMorgan Adds Privacy Features to Ethereum-Based Quorum Blockchain,"JPMorgan Chase’s blockchain team has developed a privacy feature for ethereum-based blockchains, obscuring not only how much money is being sent but who is sending it.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, JPMorgan has built an extension to the Zether protocol, a fully decentralized, cryptographic protocol for confidential payments, compatible with ethereum and other smart contract platforms and designed to add a further layer of anonymity to transactions. The New York-based financial institution will open-source the extension Tuesday, and is likely to use it with Quorum, the bank's homegrown, private version of ethereum.  Zether, which was built by a group of academics and financial technology researchers including Dan Boneh from Stanford University, uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a branch of mathematics which allows one party to prove knowledge of some secret value or information without conveying any detail about that secret.  Explaining what the new extension does, Oli Harris, JPM’s head of Quorum and crypto-assets strategy, told CoinDesk:  “In the basic Zether, the account balances and the transfer accounts are concealed but the participants' identities are not. So we have solved that. In our implementation, we provide a proof protocol for the anonymous extension in which the sender may hide herself and the transactions recipients in a larger group of parties.”  JPMorgan has had a busy year in the blockchain space, and not just with its headline-grabbing plan for an internal, price-stable cryptocurrency called JPM Coin.  Just as importantly, the firm attracted some 220 banks to its Quorum-based Interbank Information Network and most recently completed a load of integration work with Microsoft Azure as JPM continues to prepare Quorum to be spun out and exist in the wild as an open-source protocol.  Harris pointed out that Zether’s confidential payments architecture incorporates an account-based approach employed by ethereum, as opposed to the unspent transaction output, or UTXO-based approach, which the bitcoin client uses. The UTXO is also a feature of the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash, which the original ZKP component of Quorum was based on.  In this way, the extension could benefit not only users of Quorum, but also enterprises building on top of other ethereum variants – or, conceivably, businesses leveraging the public ethereum chain.  Consortium confidential  Keeping all facets of transactions between banks and other confidential could be a boon for projects like ethereum-based Komgo, for instance, which involves trading in the energy space.  “When we think about the community building on top of Quorum,” said Harris, “if anyone is looking to get an efficient trustless mechanism for trustless and anonymous payments in a consortium then that's when it's relevant. That's why we wanted to open-source it back to the community so anyone can build on it further and continue enhancing it and potentially put it into their use cases as needed.”  Harris, whose job is to strengthen Quorum efforts inside the bank and beyond, added: “When we look at our own JPMorgan applications [the extended version of Zether] will be one choice of many that we will be looking at.”  The work to make transactions more confidential on Zether could also be used to fine-tune Quorum for deployment inside enterprise consortia, making the extension another step towards hardening the protocol for a long-contemplated spin-out from the bank.  One drawback of complex zero-knowledge proving schemes is the amount of computation they eat, potentially slowing down blockchains.  But Harris said the extra dose of cryptography to obfuscate participant identities didn’t appear to have that effect with Zether, concluding:  “The performance is quite good; we had done multiple iterations to improve it and we are doing the verification in solidity smart contracts. We’ll be including in our report the performance measurements for proving and verification.”  JPMorgan Chase image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/05/28/jpmorgan-adds-privacy-features-to-ethereum-based-quorum-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11dc8626fa6f2691d3b5249d918af0c99e4b6dc2-2560x1709.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
