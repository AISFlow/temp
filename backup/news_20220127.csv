42375421,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7i1D,1643326289,First Mover Asia: Bearish Crypto Sentiment Continues as Dollar Strengthens,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin extends drop before rising slightly; Crypto Twitter was dominated by the DeFi Wonderland drama.  Technician's take: BTC's upside remains limited given the intermediate-term downtrend.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $36,948 +0.2%  Ether (ETH): $2,407 -2.6%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Polygon MATIC +0.9% Smart Contract Platform Algorand ALGO +0.6% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum Classic ETC +0.1% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −7.0% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP −4.1% Computing Solana SOL −3.8% Smart Contract Platform     Markets  S&P 500: 4,236 -0.5%  DJIA: 34,160 -.02%  Nasdaq: 13,352 -1.4%  Gold: $1,796 -1.3%  Market moves  Bitcoin extended its losses for much of Thursday, a day after hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, as the stock market also fell with some traders betting that the central bank will raise interest rates more than four times this year.  At the time of publication, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands near $37,000, up slightly over the past 24 hours but still well off its high of a week ago, according to CoinDesk data. Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down over the same time period and was trading at about $2,400. Most other major altcoins were also in the red.  Amid the bearish crypto movement, the U.S. dollar was a strengthening. At the time of publication, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) was up by 0.79% over the past 24 hours to 97.2, according to TradingView.  A strengthening dollar is usually bearish for bitcoin, as CoinDesk has reported before. Bitcoin and the dollar index in the past have moved in opposite directions. Such inverse correlation became more noticeable last July.  Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume across major crypto exchanges was down from a day ago to its lowest level this week so far.  Instead of bitcoin, at the center of the market and crypto Twitter was the surprising drama around Wonderland, a popular decentralized finance (DeFi) platform.  As CoinDesk reported, the identity of the pseudonymous treasury manager for Wonderland was revealed on Twitter as Michael Patryn, co-founder of QuadrigaCX, a notorious Canadian crypto exchange that defrauded investors of more than $190 million. The shocking fact has shaken “Frog Nation,” a group of protocols including Wonderland led by well-known DeFi developer Daniele Sestagalli.  At the time of publication, the price of wonderland (TIME) was down by more than 25% to $396, according to data from CoinGecko. Prices of cryptocurrencies such as SPELL that are also part of Frog Nation were also down significantly.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Stuck Below $40K Resistance; Support at $33K  Bitcoin has failed to sustain a brief price rise from $32,900 to $39,000 over the past few days. The cryptocurrency is trading in a tight range on intraday charts, and technical indicators are mostly neutral over the short term.  Price action has remained below a downward-sloping 100-day moving average on the four-hour chart over the past few weeks, which indicates strong selling pressure. So far, oversold signals have preceded brief price rises, suggesting limited upside ahead given the persistent downtrend since November.  For now, buyers will need to hold support at between $30,000 and $37,000 in order to stabilize the pullback.

The crash was characterized by sell-offs and liquidations from all angles, which continued even when the price dumped further. Fear of a bear market sparked this as investors wanted to get out before the price fell further. But not everyone followed this trend of dumping. Whales have always been known to move differently from smaller investors when it comes to the crypto market and this time was no different. While investors panic sold their holdings at low prices, these whales quietly gobbled up the ETH being dumped on the market, increasing their dominance in the market once again. Whales Fill Up On ETH In the last few weeks, whales have taken advantage of the declining market values to buy cryptocurrencies at what can be essentially said to be a discount. The price of Ethereum had dumped as low as $2,100 following the crash, leaving even more room for the whales to increase their holdings. Smaller investors had followed suit but only after whales had bought hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH.

42390154,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUu7vB,1643323318,The Privacy That DeFi Needs to Succeed,"The transparency of blockchains is often marketed as a benefit. It's not. Main Street financial consumers are never going to adopt blockchain-based financial tools as long as blockchains are radically transparent. Regular folks have secrets that they want to keep.  One of the most promising use cases for blockchains is decentralized finance (DeFi). The people who are building DeFi tools aspire for DeFi to be something more than a skate park for the risk-loving crypto-rich. They want their tools to solve real-world financial problems faced by individuals and companies, including America's 31.7 million small businesses.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series. J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  Imagine a cash-starved manufacturer in Toledo, Ohio, that has a good idea for a product. It could go to its banker for financing, but instead it turns to DeFi. In a jiffy, it tokenizes a bunch of receivables onto a blockchain and lodges them as collateral on a decentralized lending platform in return for U.S. dollar stablecoins. A few moments later, it swaps these dollars for Euro stablecoins using a decentralized exchange, sending them to its French supplier to purchase inventory.  This chain of transactions has the promise of being cheap, fast and avoiding the walled garden of regular banks. Unfortunately, our Toledo manufacturer probably won’t bother.  All blockchain transactions are public by default. The government, your competitors and your mother can all see what you are doing. Blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis and CipherTrace make it their business to track, analyze and interpret every trade and transaction.  Secrecy is vital to commerce. Not only is it important for businesses to protect the privacy of their customers, they must also keep their competitors in the dark lest their long-term strategy be divined and countered or copied. Our Toledo manufacturer doesn’t want its intentions to be telegraphed by their on-chain financial preparations.  As for individuals, they don't want their friends and colleagues to know what their salary is, or what kinds of porn they're purchasing. No one wants to be doxxed. We like our secrets.  Bricks-and-mortar finance is already capable of providing the secrecy that Main Street requires. Individuals and corporations generally trust their old-school bankers not to reveal information about their financial dealings to others. It's not quite cash-level anonymity. Yes, there are leaks and hacks. And under certain conditions, a banker must disclose information to law enforcement. But in general, Main Street trusts the confidentiality and probity of their financial provider.  So if Main Street users are ever going to migrate over to DeFi, privacy will have to be built first. But not just any privacy.  Tornado Cash has become the DeFi world's go-to tool for achieving anonymity. A user can send funds to a Tornado Cash smart contract where it gets mixed up and obfuscated with other people's funds. Later, that user can surreptitiously withdraw the same amount of money to a separate address. A technology called zk-SNARKs is used to reduce the ability of third parties to trace funds through Tornado.  Unfortunately, Tornado Cash has become a popular venue for thieves to clean stolen funds. The presence of criminals will make Main Street businesses like our Toledo-based manufacturer hesitate. Depositing company funds into a Tornado Cash smart contract may be construed as mixing them with criminally-derived funds. That's probably not the sort of money laundering risk that licit money wants to take.  The best solution for bringing privacy to DeFi is native anonymity. That is, all blockchain transactions have to be opaque by default. That way, Main Street users get the privacy they require without having to take the risk of jumbling up their coins with crooks. (Approaches like the Aztec Network, a privacy layer implemented on top of the base Ethereum layer, might be a solution.)  While native anonymity would solve Main Street's very real need for secrecy, it will lead to the next hurdle to widespread adoption: too much anonymity.  If a Main Street financial user like our Toledo manufacturer can't risk tumbling their coins with dirty money on Tornado Cash, neither can they risk commingling their funds on decentralized exchanges or lending tools that grant unconditional access to everyone, including thieves' dirty funds.  To make their tools palatable for Main Street, DeFi tool makers will have to unwind some of the native anonymity (potentially) afforded by blockchains by collecting and verifying identifying information from users. This way the tools can screen out criminals, assuring legitimate businesses that their clean funds aren't being tainted by dirty money.  Read more: How Binance, Coinbase and 22 Other Crypto Exchanges Handle Your Data  The implication is that DeFi tools will have to become privacy managers, just like old-school banks are. Users will have to trust the tools to be discreet with their personal information, only breaking their privacy when certain conditions are required, such as law enforcement requests.  It’s possible that DeFi succeeds in doing a better job of preserving privacy than traditional financial institutions. By using zero-knowledge proofs for collecting identity, DeFi tools may be able to control the spray of personal information required to gain access. This may reduce the amount of information that gets lost to hacks.  In sum, if DeFi wants to attract Main Street users, an odd mix of more secrecy and less secrecy is required. Secrecy is important to businesses and individuals. They don’t want their information to be naked for all to see. But Main Street doesn't want complete anonymity. It wants to use DeFi tools that strip away just enough secrets to assure that dirty money is being excluded.  Only when this balance has been achieved will businesses like our Toledo, Ohio, manufacturer venture onto the blockchain.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/27/the-privacy-that-defi-needs-to-succeed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d16263bf38dc2f35bd52a57980ff887553575782-6165x4457.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Total revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $363 million, below the $376.3 million expected by analysts, according to FactSet data. The adjusted net loss was $0.49 per share, compared to the $0.36 adjusted loss per share that analysts forecast. The company guided for first-quarter revenues of ""less than $340 million,"" which was below the $444 million forecast by analysts.  Robinhood went public last July at an initial public offering price of $38 per share. The stock hit a new all-time low on Monday amid an overall tech and crypto sell-off.  On the earnings call with analysts, Robinhood management was asked about plans to add new crypto coins to the platform, including Shibu Inu (SHIB). CEO Vlad Tenev said the company has been “proactively engaging with regulators” to address concerns about listing unregistered securities. “We’re being very deliberate. We want to avoid triggering SEC registration requirements for cryptocurrencies.”  Asked separately about potential plans to offer crypto staking and a marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Robinhood management said the company is building out its crypto team and looking at the regulatory landscape, but offered no specifics on future plans.  This is a developing story and will be updated.  UPDATE (Jan. 27, 22:20 UTC): Updated with details throughout.

42375413,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7hr9,1643319527,DOJ Indicts Cryptsy Exchange Founder for Stealing $1M in Crypto,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has indicted Project Investors Inc. (also known as Cryptsy) CEO and founder Paul Vernon for stealing $1 million from wallets that the now-defunct crypto exchange controlled, the agency announced Wednesday.  In a 17-count indictment that was unsealed in federal court in Miami, the DOJ charged Vernon, 48, with tax evasion, wire fraud, money laundering, computer fraud and destruction of records in a federal investigation, among other charges.  The DOJ is alleging that between May 2013 and May 2015 Vernon stole over $1 million from wallets that the exchange controlled and used his own crypto wallet to transfer the funds into his personal bank account. But “at no time during this time period” did Vernon disclose the theft to his customers.  According to the DoJ, in July 2014, Vernon informed Cryptsy employees that a hacker had stolen $5 million in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from the exchange, but he didn't report the hack to his customers until November 2015.  The agency says that in 2016, after moving to China and announcing that Cryptsy was in receivership, Vernon hacked into Cryptsy servers from a remote location, stole Cryptsy’s database containing customers’ funds and destroyed the database to conceal his illegal activity. Vernon remains in hiding. Cryptsy closed in 2016.  The DOJ is also alleging that Vernon filed “false and fraudulent” federal income tax reports, substantially underreporting and underpaying what he owed.  David Silver, a securities fraud and investment loss attorney who filed a civil lawsuit against Vernon and the exchange, believes that Vernon remains in China. Silver told CoinDesk that he will continue to track the 11,325 bitcoins that “went missing and which remains untouched in private wallets.”  “We continue to track those coins in real time,” Silver said. “If Vernon ever tries to liquidate the stolen money, we will work within the boundaries of the law to freeze and recover that stolen bitcoin.”  Read more: Cryptsy CEO Stole Millions From Exchange, Court Receiver Alleges",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/27/doj-indicts-cryptsy-exchange-founder-for-stealing-1m-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08574c68b87038c3e871e6fcefcbcd5529242704-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375418,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7hxR,1643319260,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rangebound Ahead of Option Expiry; Expect Higher Volatility,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded in a tight range between $35,000 and $38,000 on Thursday after a few days of sharp price swings.  Traders are starting to position themselves ahead of the bitcoin options expiry on Friday. So far, volume on open interest, or the total number of outstanding option contracts, indicates bearish sentiment, although some analysts expect BTC's price to trade closer to the max pain price of $42,000, or the strike price with the most open options contracts.  ""More volatility is expected as $2 billion worth of options are set to expire this Friday. We are seeing mixed sentiments among traders,"" Lennard Neo, head of research at StackFunds, a Singapore-based crypto investment firm, wrote in a Thursday briefing.  CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole pointed to the recent jump in bitcoin's six-month put-call skew (the cost of bearish puts relative to bullish calls). The jump in skew suggests market participants are seeking protection from downside volatility.  Historically, a positive six-month skew has signaled peak bearish sentiment, similar to what occurred in April 2020 and late May 2021, according to Godbole.  Uncertainty in the options market could lead to more price swings, creating difficulties for some traders who rely on stable price trends.  ""It is possible that we could see short-term rallies over the next several weeks, but overall maintain that monetary tightening will continue to present choppy waters for crypto through Q1 and into Q2,"" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FundStrat wrote in a newsletter.

Large holders remain  Bitcoin transfer volumes have been dominated by large institutional size flows, according to blockchain data compiled by Glassnode. The chart below shows more than 65% of all BTC transactions have been larger than $1 million in value over the past year.  The uptrend in large bitcoin transaction volumes started around October 2020 when the BTC price was between $10,000 and $11,000, according to Glassnode. Still, the uptrend in transfer volumes has slowed over the past few months as BTC established a higher price range between $28,000 and $69,000.  Some analysts point to large holders and long-term investors as a stable source of BTC demand. But will these deep-pocket investors stick around if crypto prices continue to fall?  “The crypto market is currently going through another test amidst broader macroeconomic uncertainty relating to global interest rate policy and repricing of risk-on assets,"" Thomas Perfumo, head of business operations and strategy at Kraken Intelligence, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  ""Investor sentiment in crypto markets is greater than when markets briefly turned over eight months ago. Long-term confidence in the prospects of both assets has not disappeared, as some might argue,"" Perfumo wrote.

42375412,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7hpt,1643316428,Fan Token Site Socios Sues Argentine Soccer Association for Signing Competing Deal With Binance,"Fan token site Socios sued the Argentine Football Association (AFA) for unilaterally terminating a sponsorship contract with it and signing a similar one with crypto exchange Binance.  Socios filed a complaint before an Argentinian national commercial court led by judge María José Gigy Traynor, who issued a prohibitory injunction ordering AFA to recognize the three contracts signed with Socios, according to the official document, which was seen by CoinDesk.  AFA recognized the injunction but told CoinDesk it is provisional and will be appealed by the association.  According to the injunction, AFA must “refrain from performing any action, carry out any proceeding, or apply any measure that would hamper the exercise of exclusive rights"" by Socios.  The legal actions came just days after the AFA announced that it had signed an agreement with Binance to sponsor its national soccer teams and professional soccer league for five years. The deal includes the development of a fan token that will be released to the market ""shortly,"" the crypto exchange said in a statement.  Three weeks ago, the AFA canceled a similar package of three contracts that it signed in 2021 with Socios, including the launch and maintenance of the national team token, $ARG, both parties told CoinDesk.  The AFA alleges that Socios had defaulted on a payment four months ago, the association told CoinDesk, without disclosing the exact amount. According to the AFA, Socios received repeated notices but didn't make the payment.  The AFA also said that Socios didn't sufficiently promote the Argentina token, which was released in August at $4.32 and was trading at $1.18 on Tuesday. In addition, the AFA said that there were ""several breaches"" in the use of the image of the national team and the professional soccer league by Socios, without disclosing details.  Socios told CoinDesk that it made all corresponding payments to the AFA and has no debts with the association. The company said that the token price doesn't appear in any clause as a sufficient reason to cancel the contract and added that ""there has been no misuse of the AFA’s image.""  The AFA said that it has started its own legal actions against Socios, alleging non-performance of the contract.  According to a source close to the transaction, the AFA received a higher financial offer from Binance and tried to pressure Socios to match it, something the company didn't accept because a contract was in place. The AFA denied that accusation.  The AFA also denied that it had terminated the agreement with Socios to make room for Binance and that Binance always had AFA on its radar. ""Binance had presented interest in AFA for several years, even before Socios,"" an AFA spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Binance didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Second termination  In parallel, the AFA canceled an agreement it had signed in November with Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit as the main global sponsor of its national teams for two years.

42411522,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOjdd,1643314679,Watch Out for the Pols Bearing Crypto,"Public institutions of all kinds, including government treasuries, are steadily warming to bitcoin and cryptocurrency. The volatile new asset class presents an opportunity for governments, which are often underfunded, to reap massive rewards. The risks are self-evident, although some in the crypto industry might say it’s riskier for governments not to get involved.  Earlier this month, Rio de Janeiro, one of Brazil’s largest cities, announced its intentions to allocate 1% of its municipal treasury to crypto. It will also give a discount to those taxpayers who pay their dues in bitcoin and rework its tax code to attract foreign, crypto-rich, individuals and companies.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “It makes a lot of sense for the city of Rio de Janeiro to become a tech hub, and also work with blockchain technologies,” Municipal Secretary for Economic Development Chicão Bulhões told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday.  Bulhões also noted that the city’s burgeoning blockchain industry, which includes stablecoin issuer Transfero and crypto fund Hashdex, is perhaps one of the largest in Latin America.  “It's the future that is already here. So we want to be a part of it,” he said.  You might think Copacabana and Ipanema beaches would be enough of a draw, but several cities and governments are following a similar playbook to Rio’s to compete for this wave of capital.  Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who attended the “innovation week” where Rio announced its plans, was a first mover. He recently took a paycheck in bitcoin, floated tax breaks, promised Miami would buy bitcoin and set up a “MiamiCoin,” where anyone can mine on the Stacks blockchain to reap rewards for both Miami’s semiofficial wallet and themselves.  There are others, too. New York City Mayor Eric Adams wants to become “mayor of all the bitcoins.” Scott Conger, the mayor of Jackson, Tenn., is trying to find a way to mine bitcoin in a disused wing of city hall. Mark Wheeler, chief information officer of Philadelphia, is extending the city’s namesake brotherly love to the coins.  Reshma Patel recently ran a campaign to become the next comptroller of New York City with a thought-out blockchain plan that included investing the city’s pension fund in “major cryptocurrencies.”  See also: Nayib Bukele Is Not the Bitcoin Hero We Need  “Bitcoin has a set, finite supply, which gives investors a hedge against inflation – which could be on the rise if further stimulus actions are needed. Fears of inflation today, and through the future, are valid, and that is why some of the world’s most forward-thinking companies, like Tesla and Square, have invested a portion of their total cash reserve in bitcoin,” Patel wrote in a draft policy proposal.  Patel didn’t win her bid for office, but her thinking is widespread. Crypto investors steeped in the community thinking of crypto, look at all this and say, “It’s game theory.” All governments, just as all people, will one day have to own crypto if it becomes widespread – and it will – and those who move quickly now will benefit the most. It’s the money of the future on sale today.  One notable example of this idea came from maven investor Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, which predicted the price of bitcoin could reach $1 million by decade’s end, with “nation-state “adoption” being a prime mover behind the increase.  That is the “hodlers” mindset. Bitcoin, admittedly, isn’t great to use today. It’s volatile, expensive and – most importantly – deflationary, meaning if you sell or trade it for anything today, you might regret it later when it’s much more expensive. And because bitcoin is capped at a supply of 21 million coins, if demand goes up, so will prices. Economics 101.  It’s for that reason that MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, the uber-holder, is careful not to call bitcoin a “currency,” but a rapidly appreciating digital asset. MicroStrategy made waves in 2020 when it became the first publicly traded company to allocate a portion of its assets to bitcoin.  Several, but not many, companies have followed suit. As have a few governments, like El Salvador’s. The country has made bitcoin a legal tender, and its president executes late-night bitcoin buys using public funds.  There is certainly an argument that cryptocurrencies – especially bitcoin, which is the first, most decentralized and so far most resilient coin – will increasingly appear more attractive for public institutions to invest in. It’s where the smart money is going. Gold hasn’t held up its promise to be an inflation hedge.  Read more: Bitcoin Is 'Armageddon Insurance'? | The Node  Ultimately, as an advocate for democracy, I want all governments to do what their citizens vote for – whether that’s buying bitcoin or banning it. But it’s important to remember that crypto still comes with risks, even if you can rationalize your investment, or even your losses.  If cities start plowing into crypto, it will become important to note when (if ever) governments offload their assets and where they appropriate the funds.  Rio de Janeiro's tidy 1% investment is prudent, a way to potentially reap a windfall without betting the house.  “We're talking about Web 3.0, here, we're talking about a probably new revolution in the way people pay their bills or pay their taxes or even their investments,” Bulhões said. “It's new for everyone. It's new for us.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/27/watch-out-for-the-pols-bearing-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c475757bc8bcf1269c38887c699f03a88625dead-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For all of 2021, derivatives notional value traded of $53.8 billion was up 812% from the previous year.  Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which owns CoinDesk.  Spot trading volume of $30.8 billion in Q4 was up 23% from the previous quarter, with full-year volume of $116.5 billion, up 463%.  As the Genesis numbers make clear, derivatives trading has been the key driver for boosted volumes at global crypto exchanges, pushing U.S.-based Coinbase, for example, to recently acquire FairX to improve its standing versus competitors. Over the last 24 hours, derivatives trading volumes at Binance were $78 billion versus spot volumes of just $20 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  Genesis said loan originations hit $50 billion in Q4, up 40% from Q3. Loan originations for all of 2021 were up nearly sevenfold from 2020.  Bitcoin (BTC), however, lost some of its lending mix dominance, with Genesis citing the discount to net asset value (NAV) for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as the reason. (Grayscale Investments, which manages the trust, is also unit of Digital Currency Group.)  BTC accounted for just 27.5% of the lending mix at year end against 53.9% 12 months earlier. Gaining share were U.S. dollar and equivalent loans, rising to nearly 40% by the end of 2021 versus 23.2% in 2020.  The firm also said it is seeking to grow its non-fungible token-backed lending portfolio as the sector grows. For now, the company said most of its NFT lending volumes are driven by high net worth individuals.

The RON token enables users to pay for transactions on Ronin and also includes decentralized finance (DeFi) features like community governance and future utility via staking through validators to earn rewards.  RON is currently trading at around $3.75, according to CoinMarketCap.  Ronin was launched in February 2021 and aims to speed transactions and eliminate expensive gas fees for players. In November, the layer 2, or companion, blockchain product from Sky Mavis processed 560% more total transactions than the Ethereum blockchain, according to a report from Nansen.  The blockchain currently has 250,000 unique daily active addresses, according to Nansen data, and processed 15% of all non-fungible token (NFT) volume in 2021.  As an incentive, Sky Mavis said it is offering users free transactions for holding Axies and Land in their Ronin wallets.  “It's important that Ronin has shared ownership by the community that builds and uses it. In the first month of Ronin, Axie experienced a 300% increase in monthly NFT trading volume and a 131% increase in daily active battlers,” said Jeff Zirlin, Sky Mavis growth lead and co-founder.  The company said the Ronin blockchain is more energy efficient than the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, using 0.0000015 kilograms of carbon emissions for one Ronin transaction, compared with what it takes for one Bitcoin transaction 1,079.18 and Ethereum 125.26.",POSITIVE,RON,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | RON,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/27/axie-infinity-founder-sky-mavis-launches-ron-governance-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cb5fd7843df6068ca6e6e8de708e67a88d32f60-8164x6123.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We know that [bitcoin] is volatile, that some people criticize us for that, but it is the future, and Rio wants to be a reference for the world as a cryptocurrency-friendly city, like Miami or Zug in Switzerland,"" Bulhões said.  According to Bulhões, locals are wary of cryptocurrencies, especially after police cracked down on an alleged financial pyramid scheme involving crypto assets, that took place in Cabo Frio and other cities near Rio de Janeiro.  ""This shocked a little bit the credibility of crypto around the population, which is not used to this matter,"" Bulhões said, adding that the city is home to several crypto companies, including crypto asset managers Hashdex and Transfero.  According to Bulhões, the treasury announcement generated great enthusiasm among locals. ""Suddenly, the city was just really excited about this matter. All the press here in Brazil and Latin America wanted to know more and understand what the city was doing. Also, it got people the feeling that Rio de Janeiro was back,"" he said.  The use of crypto can help locals hedge against inflation, Bulhões said, adding that, despite its volatility, the deflationary nature of some digital assets can be beneficial amid rising prices and play an important role to reduce inequality in the country.  ""The last four years have been difficult for Brazil with inflation. And we know that some cryptocurrencies are deflationary and can be used for people not to lose purchasing power. That got people interested in the possibility of having an alternative to central banks, and having more possibilities to fight inequality,"" he said.  According to Bulhões, Rio de Janeiro’s move to lean into crypto was inspired more by Miami’s example than that of El Salvador, which became the first country to make bitcoin legal tender last year.  “We believe we are similar to Miami, we have the beaches, a good place to live, the creativity,"" Bulhões said.  On Jan. 14, Eduardo Paes, Rio’s mayor, announced the city’s plans to allocate 1% of Brazil's second-most populous city's treasury reserves to cryptocurrencies. The city also plans to release its own cryptocurrency, Crypto Rio, and create a special area with tax incentives to attract technology companies.  In addition, the city plans to apply discounts to tax payments made with bitcoin, Rio de Janeiro's finance secretary Pedro Paulo said in January, adding that the administration needs to study the legal framework.  Rio de Janeiro’s government has also created a working group to propose actions related to the development of crypto in the city.

42375420,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7hzx,1643304665,How Did a Former Quadriga Exec End Up Running a DeFi Protocol? Wonderland Founder Explains,"Following one of the most tumultuous 48 hours in recent crypto history, DeFi’s most freewheeling act is showing signs that it may be coming to an end.  On Thursday morning, popular on-chain analyst zachxbt revealed in a Twitter thread that 0xSifu, the pseudonymous treasury manager for decentralized finance (DeFi) project Wonderland, is in fact Michael Patryn – the co-founder of a notorious Canadian crypto exchange that defrauded investors of upward of $190 million.  Read more: Wonderland Rattled After Co-Founder Tied to Failed QuadrigaCX Exchange  The revelation has rocked “Frog Nation,” a loose conglomerate of projects that include Popsicle Finance, Wonderland and Abracadabra, which are all now helmed by prolific DeFi developer Daniele Sestagalli.  Frog Nation-related assets, including ICE, TIME and SPELL, are down on the day in excess of 30%, and observers are now worried that Abracadabra’s MIM – one of the largest algorithmic stablecoins with a circulating supply in excess of $4.6 billion, according to CoinGecko – may lose its peg.  In an effort to understand how Patryn came to be so deeply embedded in the organization, CoinDesk reached out to Sestagalli, who expressed doubts about the manner in which he ultimately revealed his colleague’s past to the community – but not about working with him in the first place.  “I have been thinking today, could I have prevented more damage today by saying, ‘Yes, it’s him?’ I don’t know,” Sestagalli said.  Read more: Wonderland’s TIME Sets Low of $420 After Liquidation Cascade  First meeting  Sestagalli told CoinDesk that he initially began talking to Patryn in a trading group with other prominent crypto personalities. Sestagalli had previously taken note of how Patryn added valuable input in a variety of other chat channels, particularly related to yield farming mechanics.  When Sestagalli launched Wonderland, a fork of Olympus DAO, in September, he thought that Patryn would be a natural fit, particularly after Patryn made suggestions for Abracadabra features.  “When I decided I wanted to launch Wonderland, I said to him, ‘I know you know a lot about OHM,’ and he had a deep understanding of bonding. [I said,] ‘Do you want to help me use the Olympus DAO model to raise funds for a DAO?’” Sestagalli said. OHM is the native token of the Olympus DAO platform.  While the two were working together, Wonderland grew to be arguably the most successful Olympus fork, at one point even exceeding Olympus’ treasury. Sestagalli and Patryn became notorious for their aggressive use of treasury funds, investing in startups and deploying yield farming strategies, though they were often accused of recklessness.  “We had tons of meetings, passed through moments and difficult decisions – that’s how I met him. Not as a person, but as Sifu,” Sestagalli said.  Read more: Avalanche-Based Wonderland Makes Seed Investment in Betting Dapp  The two first met in person after Sestagalli had to flee his country of residence last year after threats against his family following his home address being doxxed. Sestagalli invited Patryn and other Frog Nation developers to move to the same region.  Patryn eventually agreed, and as the two grew closer in person, Patryn revealed his past.  The ‘Quadriga situation’  According to Sestagalli, his personal experience working with Patryn led him to believe that the convicted felon had turned a new leaf.  “In my personal opinion, I try to avoid judging people for what they have done in the past. I tried to stick to the experience I had with him, and we had many, many months of working together, talking every day and building successful things together.”  Anon culture is popular in crypto, especially in DeFi circles where it is not uncommon for founders and prominent members to maintain some level of anonymity.  Nonetheless, Sestagalli was taken aback by the revelation, saying he “felt like I was living in a Netflix documentary.”  “When he told me, it was kind of wild. ‘It’s me, it’s this,’ I was like ‘holy f**k.’ Of all the people I could have encountered in my journey, I encountered him. What were the chances?”  Coincidentally, Patryn first met Gerald Cotten on a message board and developed that relationship both online and then eventually in person as the two men started up Quadriga.  Sestagalli says he conducted personal due diligence on Patryn’s background, but ultimately decided to overlook his colleague’s history because Patryn “has not had any behavior internally in our experience that would raise any red flags.”  “I did my own research. I looked into it, I said, ‘OK, there is a young guy who did some credit card stuff – you understand? Some mistakes when he was young. And then there was the Quadriga situation, which is definitely unclear,” Sestagalli said.  Patryn had been convicted of identity fraud and spent time in federal prison in the U.S. At that time, he went by the name of Omar Dhanani and became “Michael Patryn” after serving his time, something he had previously denied as recently as 2019.  QuadrigaCX was founded by Cotten and Patryn in 2013, quickly becoming one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volumes in Canada. Cotten died in December 2018 after a trip to India, after which over $190 million worth of cryptocurrency owed to 115,000 customers was deemed missing, according to reports.  Where the funds went remains a mystery, as Quadriga executives claimed that only Cotten had access to the private keys that held the millions of dollars' worth of client funds.  Sestagalli admitted that the circumstances surrounding Cotten’s death did give him pause.  “To be honest, at the beginning when I did my research, I had my doubts. You know? I was like, ‘Yo, I’m another co-founder, I don’t want to end up like the last one,’” Sestagalli said, laughing.  Ultimately, however, he opted to trust his gut.  “You can look at something from afar, and you can look someone in the eyes. I asked him, what was his version of the situation? And in my opinion, at that point in time, let’s be realistic – it was good enough. If it wasn’t, I would have put him out.”  Community vote  Sestagalli claimed multiple times throughout the interview that the TIME treasury funds – now worth in excess of $700 million, according to a dashboard shared with CoinDesk – previously managed by Patryn are safe.  Additionally, in a post in Discord on Thursday morning, Patryn himself wrote that there is “no risk to Wonderland assets if something happens to me.”  The funds are reportedly managed by a multi-signature scheme, a popular tool that requires multiple individual signatories to approve transactions. Multi-sigs are broadly considered to be a bare-minimum security tool, however, particularly when they are used to manage a fund of Wonderland’s size.  Sestagalli said that what happens next is in the hands of the rarely invoked Wonderland DAO.  “Right now, [Patryn] is not managing the treasury, and the community needs to vote on if he should stay. That will happen today,” he said.  A vote is now taking place to decide if Patryn should be permanently removed from his position as treasurer.  Sestagalli noted that he will be abstaining from the vote, only the seventh in the DAO's (decentralized autonomous organization’s) history. “I already made my choice,” he said.

Chainlink develops “oracle” networks that connect real-world data with smart contracts built on blockchains. European telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom is one of the main data providers to Chainlink.  Catalini and Boneh will primarily work on the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a new international standard for decentralized inter-blockchain messaging, data, and token movements. With CCIP, users will be able to move tokens and execute smart contracts across different blockchains via the Chainlink Network.  “To ensure that CCIP launches as the most secure cross-chain protocol in the world, we’re bringing on some of the greatest minds in crypto-economics and cryptography to work with us,” said Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov.  Prior to joining Chainlink, Catalini was one of the co-creators and the chief economist of the Diem Association, owned by Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), which was looking to create a stablecoin. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Diem Association is selling its technology to Silvergate Capital for $200 million, citing an unnamed person.  Catalini and Boneh will also be working with the Chainlink Labs research team on the economics section of the Chainlink 2.0 white paper.  Chainlink is aggressively hiring and expanding its advisory team. In December, Chainlink added former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who helped launch services Gmail, Google Maps and Chrome and acquired YouTube and Android during his time running the search giant. Schmidt joined Chainlink as a strategic adviser.  There has recently been a wave of Web 2 talent rushing into the Web 3 space as blockchain, gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) companies continue to form and expand.  This past week, YouTube’s head of gaming, Ryan Wyatt, announced he will be joining Polygon as the CEO of Polygon Studios, while YouTube’s senior director of creator partnerships Jamie Byrne said he would be joining NFT platform Bright Moments in a leadership role.

The rejection of Fidelity's application for the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust on Thursday comes just seven days after the SEC threw out a spot bitcoin ETF application filed by investment advisory firm First Trust and hedge fund SkyBridge Capital.  The rejection follows the precedent set by the SEC in preferring ETFs that track bitcoin futures.  ""While we are disappointed by the outcome of the SEC’s deliberations resulting in today’s disapproval order, we reaffirm our belief in market readiness for a physical bitcoin exchange traded product and look forward to continued constructive dialogue with the SEC,"" said a spokesperson from Fidelity.  In December, the regulator rejected investment firm Kryptoin's proposal to list a spot bitcoin ETF. It has also rejected spot bitcoin ETF proposals from VanEck and WisdomTree.  In October, the first-ever ETF backed by bitcoin futures was launched by ProShares trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The 11 representatives, which include Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), Tim Ryan (R-Ohio) and Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), have written to Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen asking for clarity on how the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act defines a broker.  The bill, according to the letter dated Jan. 26, ""affords the Department of Treasury the ability to interpret who within the digital asset ecosystem qualifies as a 'broker.' This subjective interpretation has the potential to reach those beyond the intent of Congress.""  As an alternative, the representatives propose following a definition which avoids placing ""unworkable customer reporting obligations"" on parties who do not in fact have customers, such as crypto miners and stakers.  The act, which passed in Congress last November and was signed into law by President Biden, contains a number of crypto provisions, with one imposing reporting requirements on brokers.  Similar concerns over how the act defines a broker were raised previously, with a group of six senators penning an open letter to Yellen in December.

42390155,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUu80J,1643300354,The Algorithmic Life Is Not Worth Living,"It’s Privacy Week here at CoinDesk, and we’ve been diving into a variety of technological and legal angles on the consequences of digital surveillance. Anxiety about the rise of omnipresent snooping can often feel like an academic matter of principle, or a series of warnings about important but uncommon edge cases: the battered spouse being stalked with malware, the dissident tracked and murdered by a government, the consumer with legal but socially marginalized tastes. These scenarios of privacy compromise have serious implications, of course, for those who fall victim and for every single one of us.  But the most widespread use of digital surveillance can seem far more mundane than these headline examples, while being potentially vastly more insidious.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  Algorithmic content targeting is the foundation of omnipresent information businesses like Google and Facebook, and it affects you every moment you’re online. It can make you less informed, less unique, less thoughtful and less interesting, so subtly you don’t even notice.  Harvard researcher Shoshana Zuboff describes the impact of algorithmic targeting as “the privatization of the division of learning.” We have increasingly handed over our decisions about everything to pattern-recognition software, she argues. It guides our interactions with social media, dating sites, search engines, programmatic advertising and content feeds – and it’s built almost entirely on models of past human behavior. At its structural root, it is hostile to novelty, innovation and independence. And its pioneers have benefitted hugely from it – according to Zuboff, Google now has a “world-historical concentration of knowledge and power.”  I have a slightly snappier name for this than Zuboff: the Algorithmic Loop. Like most loops, it is easy to get trapped in because it harvests our preferences, then uses that data to keep us hooked – and take control. Sure it shows us prospective dates or movie titles or news blurbs that it knows we’re likely to click. But those suggestions in turn shape our desire for the next thing we consume.  The algorithmic loop, in short, doesn’t just predict our tastes, attitudes and beliefs, it creates them. And because it shapes them based on only what it already knows and can understand, it is making us less creative and less individual in ways that we have barely begun to understand.  Over time, the individual and collective effects may prove devastating.  Lowest common denominator  How is the algorithmic loop narrowing the range of human thought and creativity?  The dynamic varies but consider the basics. Companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google ultimately make money by showing you things you might want to buy. One level up, social, search and streaming platforms keep your attention by showing you content you are most likely to find “engaging.” They accomplish these goals by observing your behavior, matching it to the behavior of similar people, then showing you the other things those people liked.  These systems are sometimes praised for their ability to help users with niche tastes find precisely what they’re looking for, and there is some truth to that. But the larger dynamic is easy to spot: The algorithmic loop operates on the fundamental assumption that your taste is interchangeable with other peoples’. The algorithm can neither predict nor create personality, innovation or chance encounters – which means that it is ultimately hostile to personal empowerment and individuality.  As a thought experiment, imagine a truly average user of YouTube or Amazon Prime Video. What do you suggest to someone who has rented five mainstream Hollywood films because that’s all they’ve heard of? Well, you offer them more of the same mainstream, middlebrow, easygoing content. Even when content truly is tailored to a demographic niche, the creative process has become an exercise in box-checking: Netflix, famously, uses its algorithmic loop to “optimize” a piece of content for success before it is made. If art at its best is a process of self-discovery and learning, the algorithmic loop is turning us away from that and toward simply repeating ourselves endlessly.  That algorithmic bias towards banality, along with other forces, has already dumbed down our culture in measurable ways. In the 20-odd years since algorithmic recommendation engines have been in the wild – first at online bookstores like Amazon, then at Netflix’s DVD service, then on streaming video and music platforms – global popular culture has undergone a radical contraction centered on the most popular and inoffensive blockbusters.  For example, Spotify, an algorithm-centered music platform, concentrates streams and earnings among a handful of top artists far more than the physical media-and-broadcasting system that preceded it. This is particularly striking because the terrestrial radio conglomerate ClearChannel was so often a bugaboo for music fans in the pre-internet 1990s, accused of silencing adventurous or controversial artists. We now live in the era of the “infinite jukebox,” with practically all the music ever recorded just a click away – yet melding that to the algorithmic loop seems to have made music consumption more monolithic, not less.  Hollywood movie studios, major book publishers and music labels have all responded to this winner-take-all model. They have shifted en masse to focusing almost entirely on blockbusters and stars, committing resources only to artists who produce the most widely loved product – and even then only to their clearest hits. This broad seachange has made it vastly more difficult for even slightly unconventional musicians and filmmakers, those capable of introducing new and exciting ideas, to financially support their work (to say nothing of writers, who have always struggled). Instead, we get an endless string of Marvel movies.  In fairness, there are other major factors behind these changes. Hollywood, for instance, is grappling with a secular decline in theater attendance that creates pressure to make less-challenging content because it needs butts in seats. U.S. political culture was increasingly partisan well before the algorithmic loop made sorting people into opposing, equally single-minded hives a process as unconscious as breathing. At the very highest level, the trend toward a “winner-take-all economy” began with the invention of the telegraph: Improving communication technology allows the very best performers, businesses and products to dominate ever-larger shares of the global market for just about everything.  But the algorithmic loop is what allows the winner-take-all dynamic to infiltrate every aspect of our lives, online and, increasingly, off. It is what constantly tempts us with news or products or tweets that might not make us any more thoughtful or empathetic or well-informed – but which everyone else, as the algorithm knows, seems to be enjoying.  Reject tradition, embrace yourself  The algorithmic loop is the cybernetically enhanced version of a problem humans have been grappling with since before machine learning, the internet or computers even existed.  In ye olden times, the problem went under names like tradition, hierarchy, superstition, conventional wisdom or just “the way things are.” Three decades ago, legal scholar Spiros Simitis predicted just how powerful these systems could be for molding people’s behavior into acceptable forms, much like traditional hierarchies. In a passage cited by Zuboff, Simitis argued that predictive algorithms were “developing … into an essential element of long-term strategies of manipulation intended to mold and adjust individual conduct.”  Such forces have been viewed with suspicion for thousands of years. You’ve likely heard the phrase, “The unexamined life is not worth living,” one of the most famous aphorisms of Socrates, the foundational philosopher of the Western world (as passed down by his student Plato and Plato’s student Aristotle – Socrates didn’t even write, much less code). The general sentiment is clear and obvious enough: Spend some time reflecting on yourself. It’s good for you.  But Socrates also meant something much more specific: To truly examine yourself, you have to interrogate all of the social norms, unspoken assumptions and historical conditions that shaped you. Until then, you’re essentially the puppet of the people who came before you and established the norms, whether we’re talking about church doctrine or aesthetic judgment.  A couple of thousand years later, pioneering psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud restated this a bit more explicitly, in a slogan that also has the advantage of sounding totally badass in Freud’s native German: “Wo ist war, soll ich verden."" Or in English: “Where it is, there I will be.” The “it” Freud is referring to is the unconscious mind, which he saw as shaped by the traditions and social norms hammered into all of us from birth. By Freud’s time, modernity and technology had helped make those norms ever more widespread, uniform and rigid, particularly during the sex-repressing Victorian era of Freud’s youth.     Freud believed the conflict between social norms and individual desires was a source of mental health problems. He hoped that his “talking cure” could help patients who felt strangely out of place in their repressive society, by making visible both the norms that are so often unspoken, and the desires that people sometimes hide even from themselves. We might understand disturbing findings about the mental health impacts of social media in similar terms: A constant stream of the most popular content might sometimes amount to a psychically damaging erosion of individuality by the dominant social order.  The algorithmic loop may not seem quite as harsh a master as the social norms of Victorian Europe – but it is often more insidious. Repressive social norms that are visibly enforced by a policeman or priest may be easier to defy than the algorithmic loop, because now we’re the ones doing the clicking, the streaming, the scrolling. It certainly feels like we’re making individual choices, affirming our uniqueness, and expressing ourselves.  But that’s only because the curve toward groupthink is so subtle. Viewed as a total system, the algorithmic loop inevitably degrades the diversity and uniqueness of what most people see, learn, and enjoy. Even as the amount of “content” we consume skyrockets (a disturbing trend in its own right), it feels like less and less of actual consequence is on offer – less that can challenge you, help you grow, make you a better person.  No matter how much we scroll, tube or tweet, we may begin to suspect that our choices are illusory.  Escaping the loop  How, then, do you break free from a strangling vine that reads its future in your very struggle? How do you re-assert control over your own choices and your own brain?  Of course, there are individual practices requiring various degrees of commitment. A straightforward one, if not entirely easy, is to ditch Facebook and Google to whatever degree possible. Facebook especially – the company that now calls itself Meta is simply and uniformly not to be trusted. (And yes, Facebook can track you even when you’re not using Facebook.com. Here’s how to change that.)  Use DuckDuckGo for search. ProtonMail is a popular alternative to Gmail – which, yes, also spies on you. In fact, it’s learning how to write your emails for you, another instance of the seductive, narcotizing death loop we must somehow escape.  The benefits are likely marginal – in part because they already have so much data – but these moves will at least make it somewhat harder for the data hoarders to profile and entice you online.  Returning to physical media is another way to detach from the hive mind – CDs and vinyl instead of Spotify, DVDs and VHS tapes instead of YouTube or streaming services, physical books instead of (let’s be real) tweets. Learn to appreciate your local library. Using more physical media forces you to make considered choices and pay attention to it for a while, instead of just riding the algorithmic loop (though MP3s and a PLEX server aren’t a bad option either). Heck, if you really want to go buckwild, get a flip phone and subscribe to a print newspaper – you can disappear from social media and streaming like the One-Armed Man.  But these individual tweaks aren’t really The Solution any more than you can fix the obesity epidemic by eating more quinoa yourself. Digital systems are immensely more convenient than what came before, and its downsides are abstract and collective. Even if someone is deeply aware of the compromises they’re making every day, all of this is just too difficult to worry about.  For those folks – that is, most folks – a more systematic regulatory approach is needed, and good privacy regulation and practices are the linchpin. Careful limits on how much data we give advertising platforms like Google and Facebook, and how exactly they’re able to target us, create more space for individuality. There is already some precedent here – Facebook has recently been pressured to reduce advertisers’ ability to target by race, for instance (though because this is Facebook, of course there’s an easy workaround).  Then there’s the nuclear option: Make programmatic advertising illegal.  That won’t happen in the U.S., the home of the largest corporate data hoarders. U.S. legislators are too deeply biased toward profit to do anything that would hurt Facebook or Google or the thousands of ancillary adtech and marketing firms that feed on their plume of data chum.  But hypothetically, if programmatic ad targeting ended or was seriously curtailed, data about your habits and preferences would lose its value. Facebook would stop spying on you not because it was forced to, but because it would have no incentive. With your data and attention suddenly valueless you would be free to learn and explore on your own terms.

42407260,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUOknM,1643297117,Few Crypto Firms Even Trying to Comply With FATF's ‘Travel Rule’,"When it comes to complying with the so-called travel rule, the cryptocurrency industry has a long way to go.  And it’s unclear when it will reach the destination – if, indeed, it can or even wants to.  More than two and a half years after the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced that it intended to require cryptocurrency firms to retain the same customer data as banks and money services businesses for certain transactions, there is widespread unanimity among crypto groups on two points.  The first is that, despite strong initial resistance, the industry has come together to make remarkable progress toward a shared set of standards that allow virtual asset service providers (VASP), as the FATF calls them, to comply with the requirement, commonly known as the “travel rule.”  The second point of agreement is that the day when all crypto transactions meeting the FATF threshold of $3,000 or more are actually compliant with that rule is still far away.  Rob Garver is a longtime Washington, D.C., journalist who has written for American Banker, the Fiscal Times, Voice of America and ProPublica. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Privacy Week series.  The real compliance work has been done by just a small fraction of the thousands of VASPs that will eventually have to come into compliance with the requirements as the FATF’s 39 member jurisdictions adopt the standard.  “I would say that the number of VASPs actually doing anything directly with a travel solution would be numbered in hundreds, no more than that,” said Siân Jones, a senior partner with XReg Consulting. That’s just a sliver of the 30,000 or more registered or licensed in different jurisdictions around the world.  Among the relatively few VASPs that have taken any steps, “not all of those are in what you might describe as a ‘live’ mode,” Jones said. “You can imagine these 30,000 VASPs around the world all have to talk to each other eventually, and we're nowhere near the critical mass that would make that realistic. We are still way off.”  The situation is apt to frustrate governments that are worried about blind spots when fighting financial crime, and businesses that can’t be fully compliant with the rule until all or most of their peers are.  On the other hand, crypto users who are in no rush to have their personal information shared with strangers in foreign countries are likely to be relieved by the slow progress. If anything, they would prefer that companies in the field think twice before actively participating in efforts to implement the travel rule.  “Anyone in the ‘crypto’ industry who is eagerly attempting to comply with FATF guidelines should take a moment to employ some introspection and ask why they are here in the first place,” said Marty Bent, a prominent bitcoin investor and critic of the expansion of anti-money laundering requirements into the crypto space. “Bitcoin was created to completely obliterate this type of demonic control. Those who tell themselves that they align with the mission of Bitcoin should reject FATF guidelines and engage in civil and corporate disobedience.”  Nevertheless, a recent survey conducted by Notabene, a company that offers travel rule compliance software, suggested that the industry is marching toward compliance, though perhaps not as quickly as many participants think.  The survey asked 56 companies around the world about their travel rule compliance plans. In response, 67% said they intend to be fully compliant by the end of June 2022. At the same time, however, 60% said that they have not yet begun implementing the rule.  And for many of those VASPs, finding a way to be compliant with their home countries’ implementation of the travel rule could be particularly tricky, given that more than half of the countries around the world where VASPs operate have, so far, failed to issue rules or legislation explaining what compliance would look like.  Indeed, in the Notabene survey, lack of legal clarity was the most frequently cited reason given by companies for not yet being compliant.  “It’s been much slower than we anticipated,” Teana Baker-Taylor, chief policy officer for the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a lobbying group based in Washington, D.C., said of the regulatory rollout. “If everybody’s not on the same page, it creates quite a challenge for compliance.”  Travel rule and FATF origins  The FATF, based in Paris, is an intergovernmental body that was founded in 1989 to deter money laundering and, later, terrorist finance. The 39-member organization includes all of the world’s largest economies, which typically require financial services companies within their borders to comply with FATF recommendations. Because those rules often require that counterparties to transactions meet certain standards, there is a major incentive for non-member countries to require FATF compliance within their own borders.  The travel rule is an anti-money laundering (AML) measure that grew out of the United States' Bank Secrecy Act, a law passed in 1970, and which regulators have applied to mainstream financial services providers for years. The basic requirements are that when a financial institution sends or receives a transfer of money on behalf of one of its customers, it must collect and retain specific information about the transaction, including the personally identifiable information (PII) of the originator and beneficiary.  That the crypto world’s initial reaction was resistance is hardly a surprise. In an industry built on blockchain technology, with user privacy coded into its digital DNA, the idea of somehow adding an identity layer to peer-to-peer transactions was anathema.  (In some jurisdictions, such as the European Union, data privacy rules require that companies in possession of individuals’ PII hold it for no longer than regulations require. In the EU, for example, the retention requirement is five years, after which time the data must be erased.)  But regulators soon made it plain that the firms that make it possible for individuals around the world to conduct crypto transactions were never going to have much choice in the matter. Law enforcement agencies saw the anonymity of crypto transactions as an open door to the transmission of criminal proceeds, terrorist finance and other illicit activities – one that needed to be closely monitored.  In the months after the requirement was announced, the industry came together to begin building the Inter-VASP Messaging Standard, a shared protocol for communicating information about customer identities, and to develop additional protocols for sharing that information in transactions between VASPs in different jurisdictions around the world.  “Back in the early days, when we first started looking at this, there was still a lot of hesitation – looking at how to understand the nature of the problem,” said Malcolm Wright, chair of the global practitioner advisory board of the International Compliance Association and, as of early this month, head of regulatory and compliance strategy for Shyft Network, a compliance platform.  Since then, he said, there has been a “huge” amount of progress.  “The majority of the industry now understand their obligations. The FATF have released [its] final guidance, which is very, very clear on what is expected of countries in terms of how they should be regulating this and how the industry would then look to comply,” Wright said.  Proposed solutions to the Travel Rule  To the relief of many, FATF largely stood back and allowed the industry to work toward a set of solutions that would satisfy the agency’s requirements without forcing it into a preconceived set of protocols developed outside the crypto world.  The result has been a flowering of multiple different proposed solutions to the travel rule problem.  The different compliance systems take a range of approaches to the problem. Some are modeled on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network, in which a central authority maintains a list of member institutions and facilitates transactions between them. Others have stayed closer to the ethos of the crypto world, using smart contracts and other features to keep the system as decentralized as possible and to limit the number of institutions in possession of customers’ PII.  In the U.S., a group of the largest domestic exchanges and custodians formed the U.S. Travel Rule Working group, which began work on a protocol that would allow members of a closed network to share information on transactions made within the network. Later rebranded as Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST) the network is exploring ways to extend membership to VASPs outside the U.S.  Two other industry alliance models, Open VASP and the Travel Rule Protocol, out of Switzerland and Asia, respectively, have published open-source protocols designed to allow VASPS to share data required under the travel rule.  Additionally, there have been multiple commercial efforts to create travel rule compliance systems.  Internationally, a group of some of the world’s largest exchanges came together to create a travel rule compliance tool based on smart contracts. The result was Veriscope, operated by Shyft Network, which uses smart contracts to facilitate the transmission of PII. Early adopters included Binance, Bitfinex, BitMex, Tether, Huobi and some two dozen others.  CipherTrace, which was acquired by Mastercard last year, offers a system compatible with the Travel Rule Information Sharing Architecture, which was developed with the cooperation of more than 100 industry stakeholders.  Notabene, a startup founded in 2020 to address travel rule compliance, has built a system that is protocol-agnostic, seeking to solve what’s become known as the “interoperability problem” -- basically making sure that VASSPs using different travel rule compliance protocols are able to talk to each other.  Other significant players in the effort to make compliance achievable for VASPs include Sygna’s Bridge protocol, Netki’s TransactID and VerifyVASP.  Regulators, lawmakers MIA  In early January, Marcus Pleyer, deputy director general of Germany’s Federal Ministry of Finance and president of the Financial Action Task Force, published an op-ed in CoinDesk with an update on progress toward the implementation of the travel rule.  Though the headline of the piece seemed to be directed at the industry -- “Crypto Firms Can’t Outrun the Travel Rule” -- the most revealing fact in the article had little to do with the industry and everything to do with the regulations with which VASPs are supposed to be preparing to comply.  Of 128 jurisdictions contacted by FATF only 58 – fewer than half – reported they had the necessary rules and regulations in place to allow crypto companies to comply with FATF’s requirements in the first place. In total, more than 200 jurisdictions around the world aim for compliance with FATF guidance, meaning the vast majority of countries have yet to provide VASPs doing business within their borders meaningful direction on how to comply with the travel rule.  However, for many VASPs around the world, the incentive to achieve at least some level of compliance with the travel rule is coming not from their home country regulators but from abroad.  While regulators in the overwhelming majority of countries have been slow to give explicit guidance on compliance, some have been much more aggressive. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, for example, has mandated compliance with the travel rule for all crypto transactions, regardless of amount.  Likewise, regulators in Canada, Japan, South Korea, and Switzerland have put rules in place requiring compliance. In the United States, no new rulemaking was necessary. Regulators have long made it clear they expect VASPs to comply with rules similar to those applied to money services businesses and other financial institutions.  ‘Sunrise problem’  The hit-or-miss rollout of travel rule compliance guidance has created what industry experts refer to as the “sunrise” problem. As individual countries roll out travel rule compliance requirements, VASPs within those jurisdictions find it difficult, if not impossible, to abide by the rules while transacting with non-compliant VASPs in other jurisdictions.  The nature of the travel rule is such that an individual VASP cannot, by itself, remain in compliance. For every transaction subject to the travel rule information retention standard, a VASP can only be fully compliant if it is certain that the counterparty VASP on the other end of the transaction is also complying by providing the true PII of its customer.  “What's actually changed a lot right now is that people are realizing it's not just about whatever your national regulator is telling you to do, because the travel rule is about collaborating,” said Pelle Braendgaard, CEO of Notabene.  “If you perform international transactions, and most VASPs do, then you have to not just worry about what FinCEN says, for example, you have to worry about what the [Monetary Authority of Singapore] says or what the South Korean regulator says, or it's going to start really affecting your transaction volume. This is what we're seeing that's actually driving most of the adoption right now.”  Justin Newton, the founder and CEO of Netki, pointed out the stakes vary depending on the location of the counterparty VASP.  “If you are in a relatively well-regulated jurisdiction, say somewhere like Singapore or Switzerland, and if the counterparty is also in another well-regulated jurisdiction that may just not have this coming, you may be fine with doing the transaction,” he said.  But it gets tricky when doing business with firms in jurisdictions that the FATF has put on warning for falling short of the intergovernmental body’s standards.  “If the other end of the transaction is in a FATF gray-listed country, you might have second thoughts about doing a transaction with them if they don't have a travel solution live,” Newton said. “The risks start piling on top of each other and cascading.”  Increased transactional friction  What this adds up to for VASPs is an increase in transactional friction. Every transaction that requires special attention translates into a frustrated customer who simply wants to send or receive assets as efficiently as possible.  The situation is extremely frustrating to the industry, which originally balked at the requirement on privacy grounds but made a good faith effort to comply, said Baker-Taylor, of the Digital Chamber of Commerce.  “The industry was challenged to comply with a directive without having any means to do so, and since 2019 the industry has figured out how to do that and has made material progress both technologically and in the mindset to comply,” she said.  “Two years on, people have not warmed up to the idea but have accepted that this is happening and have asked, ‘How are we best going to solve for this?’ So, from an industry perspective, I honestly cannot see what else we could do. And now we're kind of at the mercy of governments to get it together.”  Joseph Weinberg, co-founder of Shyft Network, echoed that frustration. Regulators, he said, “are ultimately dictating the pace.”  “Infrastructure-wise, we've been ready for a while,” he said. “At this point, we're just working with the exchanges, making sure that the product fits all of their [regulatory] requirements.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Rob Garver,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/27/few-crypto-firms-even-trying-to-comply-with-fatfs-travel-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d2e1e7a4f48fc427fafadd48e27b2cfbefc432-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411521,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOjaK,1643291400,Where Should Advisors Go for Crypto Education?,"If 2021 was the year that many wealth management firms started taking cryptocurrencies and digital assets seriously, then 2022 has to be the year when financial advisors educate themselves in-depth on the topics crucial to understanding and working with them.  But where should they turn for this education?  Over the past few years, a number of educational services have come online for financial advisors, initially spearheaded by asset managers eager to give professionals enough knowledge to embrace their products and strategies.  “The digital assets space is exploding, the level of interest is growing exponentially,” said Ric Edelman, the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP). “We launched our certificate in May, haven’t done much to promote it, but already have 600 advisors who have completed our courses and more than 1,500 advisors enrolled.”  One asset class, many options  Previously, firms like Eaglebrook Advisors and Sarson Funds built out their own content oriented toward financial advisors.  There’s nothing necessarily wrong with the information that asset managers put out there – in fact, they often serve as partners to unaffiliated advisor education services – but advisors perhaps more than anyone else understand that investment shops often can’t resist the opportunity to talk up their own book, at times to the detriment of alternative solutions.  That’s why a set of advisor-led resources has recently come online to teach financial intermediaries about cryptocurrencies.  One of the first, established last year, is Onramp Academy, a service developed by tech platform Onramp Invest.  “Advisors need to be educated by a group of people who understand both the crypto space and financial planning intimately,” said Caitlyn Cook, vice president of operations for Onramp Academy. “Advisors need to understand how crypto impacts their practice, and there’s not been a lot of content specific to those needs.”  Another option is the DACFP’s Certificate in Blockchain and Digital Assets.  Then there’s the Certified Digital Assets Advisor (CDAA) designation, created by decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) PlannerDAO. The CDAA is distinct from other offerings in that a decentralized network of financial advisors oversees its requirements and curriculum.  “I feel like any advisor education is good to have in the marketplace, said Steve Larsen, CEO of PlannerDAO. “We feel like most certifications are just introductions and that the CDAA offers more comprehensive education that covers all areas of digital assets.”  Which offering is best?  Edelman believes that the Digital Assets Council’s certificate will be the gold standard for financial advisors. The curriculum includes 13 hours of self-study educational material divided into two parts of five modules apiece, taught by industry leaders including Edelman; Lex Sokolin, head economist and global fintech co-head at Consensys; MarketCounsel President Brian Hamburger and Shawnna Hoffman, global co-leader of IBM’s Cognitive Legal Practice.  “Part one is built around the understanding of the technology, with part two about incorporating digital assets into an investment strategy for financial advisors and firms,” Edelman said. “By completing the courses, advisors will be able to determine which clients should have an allocation to digital assets, how much that allocation ought to be and what type of investment the advisor should use to create that allocation, and in addition understand the taxation regulation and compliance issues so they can operate within the rules to serve the client’s best interest.”  But Onramp Academy has also developed an impressive curriculum with qualified instructors, in partnership with Galaxy Digital, Interaxis and CoinDesk, among others.  “We provide everything from ‘what is bitcoin or blockchain’ all the way to crypto estate planning, tax planning and getting crypto within a diversified portfolio,” said Onramp Academy’s Cook. “Our educational partners include asset managers, but also we have CFPs and practicing advisors on the team.”  The Onramp curriculum is backed by a steady stream of crypto news and resources delivered to Onramp Academy members on a regular – almost daily – basis, and a robust online and social media community of financial professionals.  PlannerDAO’s curriculum is also quite robust, but with an added bonus of offering advisors the ability to access the DAO that operates the CDAA certification and participate in the governance of the credentials.  “We view [crypto] as more of an ecosystem than an asset class,” said Larsen. “It relates to a client’s employment, their social and leisure time, the generational wealth transfer, tax planning – all areas of their finances, so it’s important that we make sure that advisors understand it. With the CDAA, people are really into this – for the first time in their careers, many advisors feel like they are connected to the industry and have a say in what’s happening.”  PlannerDAO, Onramp and the DACFP each claim to take advisors from general knowledge on the asset class to bringing digital assets into a firm or practice to specific actions and dialogues to implement with clients.  “I think what advisors really want and need is one-stop shop where they can get advised access, education, client services, in-depth research, security, compliance and technology integration,” said Eaglebrook CEO Chris King. “We make our advisors go through training modules to learn the merits and risks of investing in crypto. They need to score over 70% on our test before they can start onboarding clients to our strategies.”  A unified solution?  In the end, the best solution for advisors may be to roll digital assets and cryptocurrency into already existing designations often considered “best in breed” for different sectors of the wealth management industry. For example, the Certified Financial Planner designation offered by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards and the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation offered by the CFA Institute could be changed to include more digital assets education.  That idea is behind a proposal from Onramp Academy to merge digital assets education into the CFP and CFA curricula. Onramp argues that the time for advisors to learn about digital assets is now, and that most of the initial and continuing education for financial advisors is currently associated with the CFA and CFP designations.  “We strongly believe these two designations will continue to be the gold standard in the financial industry,” said Cook. “This is a multibillion-dollar asset class; we believe that the curricula for both the CFA and the CFP need to be more inclusive of technology advances over time. Digital assets are one of the bigger changes in the space; they need to be incorporated into the curricula.”  Notably, both the CFA Institute and the CFP Board appear open to the idea, as each has approved externally provided digital assets programs for continuing education credits – for example, the DACFP’s curriculum offers 13 hours of continuing education for the CFA and CFP designations.  “Everyone is talking about volatility and what we do now, but education never goes into a bear market,” said Cook. “This is a great time for advisors to have conversations with clients about crypto – but they need to get educated on the asset class first.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/27/where-should-advisors-go-for-crypto-education,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/080612ec275dab8492d7aa3be6022b9d94c3cb28-2000x2500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411527,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOjgw,1643291400,What Advisors Should Know About NFT Investing,"Every day seemingly brings a new scam in the world of crypto, and yet the growth of the industry is in no way slowing.  The popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), at least for now, continues to overshadow news of scams such as “rug pulls,” where NFT creators hype up the value of a new digital asset then cash out once people buy into it. Consider the recent Frosties rug pull, where more than 2,000 people bought $1.3 million in cartoon ice cream digital collectibles before the anonymous creators shut down their social media pages and disappeared. The collection of 8,888 NFTs still remains, but digital assets are only as strong as their leaders; with nobody to head up the Frosties community, all those pieces of art are nothing more than cute cartoons.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  DYOR  The general guideline among the crypto community is DYOR – “do your own research” – when buying into an NFT project of any size. But in a sector that’s evolving so fast the federal government can’t keep up and hackers are getting away with billions, what constitutes “research” can feel more like Google searches, Twitter Spaces chats and shaky ground.  NFT collectors suggest making friends with others in the space before investing any money in new projects or communities. An easy way with a low barrier to entry is to start by joining free Twitter Spaces chats and Discord communities, where you’ll learn about the added benefits that NFT projects offer buyers (known as utility), industry news and more.  From a financial planning perspective, NFTs are likened to rare collectibles like comic books, authentic artwork, doll collections, sneakers and other alternative investments: Enjoy them, but don’t expect them to fund your whole retirement. (NFTs also involve special tax considerations.)  Except, in some cases, NFTs can change someone’s financial situation dramatically – or at least they have. Consider the World of Women NFT collection, which dropped in July 2021 and had an early average price of .1 ETH (somewhere around $300 USD). The collection now ranks on OpenSea, where each NFT is valued at 7 to 8 ETH on average (between $21,000 and $24,000 at the time of writing). Or the sold out Women Rise NFT collection, which reached 1,900 ETH in trading volume (approximately $5.9 million at the time of writing) in just a few months.  Buying an NFT creates an indelible record of digital ownership on the blockchain, so the tokens can therefore serve as a membership ticket of sorts. It’s not every community’s recipe for success, but many NFT creators added value to their projects through utility to NFT purchases, awarding investors with exclusive access to online clubs, gaming communities, Discord chat rooms and interactive experiences – all in addition to the art itself.  The risks and rewards of NFTs  All this fast money has the NFT world divided. On one hand, the potential of NFTs is undeniable, but on the other, the risks and rewards are a bit head-spinning.  “This NFT thing is like when a dog gets a new toy and they just keep ripping the toy out. And then now they don't have a toy,” said Nelson Merchan Jr., co-founder and CEO of blockchain public relations firm Light Node Media. “ It’s kind of like we’re almost doing the same thing, and we’re realizing, ‘OK, maybe we shouldn’t do it this way.’”  A crypto investor since 2017, Merchan has owned NFTs from the popular Pudgy Penguins collection since shortly after it dropped in June 2021. The Pudgy Penguin founders were recently ousted by frustrated collectors who were tired of waiting for the project to deliver on its grandiose promises. But Merchan, surprisingly, isn’t terribly concerned about the state of his Pudgy Penguin NFTs, noting the promise inherent in what the situation demonstrates.  “It was definitely not a rug pull,” said Merchan, noting that rug pulls happen with speed and anonymity. During the alleged Bored Bunny rug pull on Jan. 5, for instance, scammers seemingly made off with 2,000 ETH in just a few hours before silencing their social media accounts.  The Pudgy Penguins project stands a chance, Merchan argues, because the process of replacing the leaders was community-driven, public and more or less democratic.  “Some of these projects that have been failures are actually really good,” he said. “The community, through the failure, is having to figure out how to build something from this really cool NFT and say, ‘Let’s make it work.’ Those are the NFT projects that I think have significant potential to grow because it’s the community saying we’re going to do something about it. At the end of the day, with NFTs and really crypto in general, it’s all about the community. If the community is strong, the project is going to be strong.”  When it comes to long-lasting value, investors should think into the future about ways that NFTs can integrate with existing infrastructure, argues Merchan. Through smart contracts and QR codes, NFTs have the potential to unlock greater value in both the metaverse and the “real” world through ticketing, VIP memberships and sales.  Consider the club scene. “People go to the club party, they order bottles, the promoters are there,” Merchan said. “The club is always looking for ways to keep people coming back and excited about their brand. This is where NFTs are going to be perfect. Say you attend the club a few times in that month; you’re getting a specific amount of NFTs each time you go. Maybe the level of the NFT increases in rarity if you go, let’s say, three or four times in that month.”  Rare NFTs will theoretically determine whether a person gets rare perks. And all these transactions will exist on blockchain, a sort of digital ticket stub that definitely beats the shoebox most of us kept collectibles in as kids.  Decentralized value investing  It’s almost as if investing in an NFT community could be considered a form of decentralized value investing.  “I’m really investing in the community, or at least the potential of the community to come out of these NFTs,” Merchan told CoinDesk. “If you look at it from the outside, they’ve been failures – almost all of them. But the energy is actually really strong.”  The trick is to not buy the hype, no matter how enticing. “It’s just a very crazy industry. You have to keep more of a long-term perspective. If you're buying an NFT to flip it, well, that’s just trading. There’s a lot of risk involved,” said Merchan.  “But if you’re buying it because you truly like the community, or because something about it intuitively makes you feel like it is going to go somewhere, that I think is a lot more appealing,” he noted.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | RESEARCH,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/27/what-advisors-should-know-about-nft-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a16a50856ae80afafb5befeb035f68bbb038ee6b-2000x2500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

WMG is the owner of a slew of popular music properties, including record labels Atlantic, Warner Records, Elektra and Parlophone.  The virtual theme park will feature “concerts and musical experiences” from the music company’s star-studded roster of artists, which includes the likes of Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, Dua Lipa and Cardi B, according to a press release.  As part of the announcement, The Sandbox will be hosting a LAND sale for virtual properties adjacent to the prospective festival site for fans to purchase in March. Consider it the latest corporate foray into the immersive experiences that some are calling the future of the internet.  “We are deeply focused on Web 3 right now and the impact it will have on music. It’s incredibly difficult to put value against fandom right now,” Oana Ruxandra, chief digital officer and executive vice president of business development at WMG, told CoinDesk in an interview. “The music industry had big decades in the ’80s and ’90s, and then Napster came around and there was a pullback. Then the same thing happened when Spotify came in. We want to be driving opportunity, not behind the eight ball.”  WMG isn’t the first major music player looking to expand its audience into virtual worlds. The metaverse game Decentraland hosted a three-day virtual music festival in October, with artists like Snoop Dog having toyed with virtual gatherings in The Sandbox dating back to September.  While no one knows for certain what companies getting into “the metaverse” will entail, it’s clear that partnerships with virtual reality platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland are a safe starting point.  The Sandbox’s SAND token was up nearly 7% over the past 24 hours, to $3.49 as of press time, with an upward climb starting at about 4:00 UTC.

42396171,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT14Ka,1643287853,Trezor Adopts Swiss Travel Rule Protocol for Private Crypto Wallets,"An automated way of sharing proof that a user owns a private cryptocurrency wallet when transacting with a regulated exchange in Switzerland is being integrated by hardware wallet Trezor.  Developed by crypto startup 21 Analytics, the Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP), which also works with wallets like BitBox and Edge, was designed to accommodate the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority's (FINMA) implementation of anti-money laundering (AML) requirements for cryptocurrency firms.  Going beyond the recommendations made by global AML watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), crypto requirements in Switzerland include the identification of private wallets transacting with the country’s virtual asset service providers (VASPs).  The march of AML requirements into the realm of private or non-custodial wallets is something most countries are only at the initial stage of mulling over – often to the horror of crypto advocates. But Switzerland and Singapore are already requiring identification for transactions over $1,000 with what the FATF calls “unhosted wallets.”  “Switzerland has some extra harsh regulations when it comes to the 'travel rule,' and FINMA was always at the forefront implementing everything the FATF publishes very quickly,” 21 Analytics CEO Lucas Betschart said in an interview. “So we have the Travel Rule actually being enforced here.”  When it comes to determining ownership of private wallets, VASPs in Switzerland have been asking users to submit a screenshot of their wallet, or conduct a “Satoshi Test,” whereby a specific amount of coins is sent to a verified wallet to confirm their receipt. Another way is manual signing in using a private key, Betschart said. AOPP streamlines and automates that manual signing process, he added.  “We’re glad to see more individuals taking custody of their crypto assets,” Marek Palatinus, CEO of SatoshiLabs, the maker of the Trezor hardware wallet, said in a statement. “AOPP makes it simpler and faster for users to withdraw to the safest place for their coins: their Trezor.”  Betschart also pointed out that 95% of transactions from Swiss VASPs don’t go to another Swiss VASP, but rather to a top 20 crypto exchange such as Binance, BitMEX or Bitfinex, most of which have no travel rule solution in place yet. The result is that customers of Swiss VASPs send and receive a lot of crypto via their own non-custodial wallets, often using AOPP, Betschart said.  “It’s an interesting effect of activating the travel rule in Switzerland that more people are forced to use their own wallet,” Betschart said. “So it’s not like everyone is sharing data, but just that everyone is sending to their own wallet before they can send assets to Binance, for example.”  UPDATE (Jan. 27, 13:18 UTC): Removes sub phrase ""which is obviously a security risk"" in the second line of the sixth paragraph.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | WALLET | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/27/trezor-adopts-swiss-travel-rule-protocol-for-private-crypto-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fef0a5b2c5138b400b03a0f2f89ee3611bac439-630x266.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now valued at $1.3 billion, 40-person CoinTracker – which last raised $1.5 million in a 2018 seed round – plans to scale its global tech support and integrate with a universe of crypto companies, CEO Jon Lerner said.  It’s also bulking up on high-ranking talent, sniping Uber’s Vice President of Engineering Gaurav Garg as the new head of engineering, and Zack Reneau-Wedeen, Robinhood Crypto’s head of product, for product lead.  CoinTracker’s partnership wheels are churning, too. On Monday, the company announced an exclusive deal with Coinbase’s expanded “tax center” that assists exchange users in preparing their crypto taxes.  “It's trying to get ahead of the problem, which is very important for exchanges to do, especially with this infrastructure bill,” Lerner said, referring to expanded reporting requirements set to come online in 2023.  “Every exchange will be reporting their users' capital gains to the IRS and we expect the same thing to play out in other countries as well,” he said.  Getting the 2022 tax season right will be more important for the crypto crowd. The IRS is paying increasing attention after last year’s massive spikes in everything from coin prices to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Every sale, swap and wrap is taxable as capital gains.

As of Thursday, cREAL will be available on Brazil-based crypto exchanges Ripio, FlowBTC and NovaDAX. Crypto wallets Bitfy and Coins will also support the stablecoin.  NovaDAX users will be able to spend cREAL with the prepaid crypto card issued by the crypto exchange. Bitfy customers will be able to use the cREAL throughout the Cielo network, Brazil's largest credit and debit card operator, the company said in a press release Thursday.  The cREAL was proposed and then approved by the owners of Celo's native digital asset CELO and governors of the blockchain, Celo's co-founder and Celo Foundation President Rene Reinsberg told CoinDesk.  Celo, a proof-of-stake and open-source blockchain, already has cUSD and cEUR stablecoins, pegged to the U.S. dollar and the euro respectively.  ""There was a lot of excitement for crypto in Brazil,"" Reinsberg said. ""But specifically in the Celo community, we have seen a lot of teams built on Celo, integrated with Celo, using cUSD. From the outset, Brazil was obviously one of the strongest markets in terms of adoption.""  According to Celo, cREAL works as a decentralized, crypto-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin that can be used for decentralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) apps and services on the Celo blockchain, such as the lending protocol Moola Market, the decentralized exchange Ubeswap or Valora, a mobile-first digital wallet native to the Celo network.  ""The rate of cryptocurrency adoption in high-growth markets – in particular Brazil – not only signals growing excitement for this new digital economy, but the advance of real-world use cases,"" Celo Foundation’s Latam lead Camila Rioja said in a statement.  Brazilians are turning to cryptocurrencies and, in particular, stablecoins amid record inflation and a devaluation of their local currency. According to Receita Federal, the Brazilian tax authority, between January and November 2021, locals traded $11.4 billion in stablecoins and almost tripled the total traded in 2020.  Looking to take advantage of that crypto boom, several global exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase and Crypto.com see the country as Latin America’s main market in 2022.  In Brazil, Celo currently supports projects such as ImpactMarket, a universal basic income program built on its blockchain that delivered blockchain-based aid to 10,000 beneficiaries in the Latin American country up to now, Reinsberg said.

He was also the co-founder of QuadrigaCX, a failed Canadian cryptocurrency exchange.  Avalanche-based Wonderland has been among the most popular crypto protocols in recent months, with community members referring to themselves as the “Frog Nation.” The protocol locked up billions of dollars of investor funds at its peak, but confidence was rattled among investors Thursday morning.  “0xSifu is the Co-founder of QuadrigaCX, Michael Patryn,” tweeted Zach, a pseudonymous Twitter account with a track record of unmasking crypto scams and nefarious behavior. “If you are unfamiliar that is the Canadian exchange that collapsed in 2019 after the founder Gerald Cotten disappeared with $169m.”  Wonderland founder Daniele Sestagalli confirmed the allegations in a later tweet, saying he was aware of Sifu’s identity and connections to QuadrigaCX: “I want everyone to know that I was aware of this and decided that the past of an individual doesn’t determine their future,” Sestagalli tweeted. He further confirmed Sifu’s identity in a post on Thursday morning.  The community wasn’t impressed by Sestagalli’s response.  “In 2005, he pled guilty to credit and bank fraud. In 2007, he admitted burglary, theft and computer fraud. In 2018, he and his partner ‘lost access’ to $115M in customer funds,” said Inverse Finance founder Nour Haridy in a response to Sestagalli's tweet. “I agree that inmates deserve second chances but this is NOT about being convicted.”  Crypto exchange QuadrigaCX was founded by Gerald Cotten and Patryn in 2013, quickly becoming one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volumes in Canada. Cotten died in December 2018 after a trip to India, after which over $190 million worth of cryptocurrency owed to 115,000 customers was deemed missing, as per reports.  Where the funds went remains a mystery. QuadrigaCX executives claimed that only Cotten had access to the private keys that held the millions of dollars worth of client funds. Crypto circles were quick to term the entire incident as an exit scam – a term for alleged fraudsters stealing investor funds after building up confidence. After further investigation by the Ontario Securities Commission, QuadrigaCX was deemed a Ponzi scheme; however, it also noted that a majority of the lost funds had been deposited after Patryn left the exchange in 2016.  Patryn has remained under the radar ever since, until today when he was revealed to be one of the architects behind Wonderland.  Sestagalli said in the post that Wonderland funds were secured by a wallet that required multiple signatures to access, downplaying concerns among investors.  “All funds in wonderland are managed by a multi-sign, any [FUD] related to that needs to be cut off now, as they are secured by me and the wonderland team,” he wrote in his post.  Sentiment on Crypto Twitter remained sour, however.  UPDATE (Jan. 27, 12:09 UTC): Adds tweet including excerpt from Sestagalli post.

Liquidations occur when an exchange closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.

The central bank said it remained committed to keeping inflation in check with a series of planned interest rate increases this year, a move that caused market declines across all major asset classes, including equities and cryptocurrencies.  “Digital assets, including bitcoin, tend to become more correlated with stocks during stress periods when most of the investment markets go risk-off,"" said Mikkel Morch, director at crypto hedge fund ARK36, in a note to CoinDesk.

42396183,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT14VP,1643281067,"Solana, Avalanche Post Biggest Declines After Hawkish Fed Outlook","The slight recovery in the crypto markets this week all but retracted as major cryptocurrencies dipped up to 7% in the past 24 hours after a hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve outlook to cut back on inflation.  Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was ready to raise interest rates in March and could even hike rates “at every meeting” to tackle concerns of inflation after a record asset-buying program. Seven more meetings are scheduled for this year.  Asian markets were spooked on Thursday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, which tracks the 60 largest companies, was down 2%, while South Korea’s KOSPI ended the day with a 3% decline. In Europe, Germany’s DAX, which tracks blue-chip companies, started the day with a nearly 1% drop. Futures of U.S. stock markets fell marginally in pre-market trading.  The decline in equities also passed on to the crypto markets, which functions as a risk asset class in investor portfolios. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the world’s two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, fell 4% in the past 24 hours to support levels. Bitcoin fell under $37,000 to hit support at $35,500 before gaining over $1,000 at the time of writing.  “Bitcoin showed positive dynamics all day against the backdrop of growing stock indices,” analysts at FxPro told CoinDesk in an email. “Up until the Fed meeting, the first cryptocurrency was gaining over 6%, hitting 5-day highs above $38,800. However, BTC began to fall almost immediately after the announcement of the results of the Fed's two-day meeting”  “The regulator announced a curtailment of bond purchases in early March, as well as an imminent rate hike, followed by a reduction in the Fed's balance sheet,” analysts added.  Major cryptocurrencies like Avalanche (AVAX) and Solana (SOL) fell as much as 8% during Asian morning hours, while tokens of emerging blockchains, such as Cosmos’ ATOM and Near’s NEAR token fell 13%.  Layer 1, or base, bets by crypto investors fueled price rises in ATOM, NEAR and Fantom’s FTM tokens in the past months, which was buoyed by investors’ search for yields and upside outside of the Ethereum ecosystem. But such tokens have been among the worst performers in the recent crypto sell-off, falling sharply in the past month alone.  In the past week, SOL was down 34% while NEAR investors nursed losses of 33%. Terra’s LUNA, Polkadot’s DOT and Cardano’s ADA tokens saw similar decline in the same period, data from analytics tool CoinGecko shows. Bitcoin, in contrast, fell 13%.  A saving grace among top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were the two tokens of Theta Network’, THETA and TFUEL. The tokens power services on the blockchain-based video sharing platform and were up 13% and 22% respectively in the past 24 hours. The move came ahead of an airdrop to THETA holders scheduled for Feb.1, which may have fueled interest among investors and traders.  Crypto markets staged a slight recovery at press time, with some investors continuing to downplay the effects of Fed policy on the broader market.  There are ""lots of reasons to believe that the secular macro rate of interest is still low. Interest rates are low because of incremental technology growth,” Haseeb Qureshi, founder of crypto investment fund Dragonfly Capital, said in a telephone interview.  “Crypto is one of the few things that people realize has broad growth potential,” Qureshi added.",NEGATIVE,BTC | SOL | THETA,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | THETA,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/27/solana-avalanche-post-biggest-declines-after-hawkish-fed-outlook,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04ea5a71cf43d6e071511a12e70f4709812a10d6-1601x793.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396179,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT14SS,1643279182,Bitcoin to Remain Choppy as 'Fed Put' Expires: Analysts,"Bitcoin's near-term prospects look bleak after the U.S. Federal Reserve set the stage for a more aggressive withdrawal of liquidity, weakening market confidence in the so-called Fed put – a notion that the central bank will come to the rescue if assets tumble.  On Wednesday, the Fed pointed to the U.S. economy's underlying strength and inflation's stickiness, and reaffirmed plans to end its bond-purchase program in March. It also hinted at a potential interest rate increase in the same month.  Before the event, crypto followers on Twitter were expecting Fed Chair Jerome Powell to sound less hawkish in the wake of the recent stock market drop. Powell, however, made no reference to asset prices and said policymakers feel there is quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening progress on jobs.  ""The balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be and there's a substantial amount of shrinkage that needs to be done,"" he said.  That led experts to predict choppy-to-adverse bitcoin price action in the coming weeks.  ""Bitcoin is likely to remain under pressure as there is no Fed support,"" Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani said. ""Post-Fed flows have been bearish, with most of our clients anticipating a deeper decline.""  ""The market sentiment is pessimistic, and liquidity appears to be accelerating its withdrawal from risky asset markets,"" said Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin.""In the futures market, investors are already reluctant to pay more premiums for far-month futures. That's a vital bearish sign.""  The Fed put worked in the past because inflation was low. However, with U.S. inflation running at a four-decade high, the central bank may become more accepting of asset price slides. That said, a continued decline may force the Fed to tone down its hawkish bias.  Limited downside?  While the outlook for bitcoin is bearish, the downside may be limited unless there is also a significant slide in technology stocks. Bitcoin is seen by some as both digital gold and emerging technology.  ""Bitcoin has already dropped over 40% since mid-November. Thus, downside appears limited,"" Balani said. ""However, a significant sell-off in stocks could drive the cryptocurrency under critical support at $30,000.""  Matthew Dibb, the COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, shared a similar opinion, saying, ""Support remains relatively strong for bitcoin, but a +5% drop in the S&P 500 will likely have a profound impact on crypto to the downside.""  Markets have come under pressure since the Fed's meeting. While futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index were trading 0.4% lower at press time, bitcoin was down 2% at $36,200, having faced rejection near $39,000 on Wednesday.  ""We haven't had a meaningful bounce since we broke below $40,000, just a slow grind up,"" said Laurent Kssis, a director of crypto-trading advisory firm CEC Capital. ""This doesn't feel that great given no real support has been established although, on the positive side, this structure is completely the norm for higher timeframe bottom formations.""  Kssis foresees consolidation near $35,000 but favors hedging long positions with a short futures contract, given the cryptocurrency's vulnerability to weakness in tech stocks.  Cash could be the king  With the Fed hiking cycle likely to begin in March, the U.S. dollar and stablecoins backed by the greenback could draw demand.  ""The USD strength is crazy and a major breakout looks to be forming on the dollar index,"" Stack Funds' Dibb said of the U.S. dollar. ""Looks like cash is the king.""  Futures tied to the dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, rose to 96.70 early today, marking a 2.2% rise in two weeks, according to TradingView data.  A close above the November high near 97.00 would confirm a breakout, opening doors for a continued rally. A dollar rally is considered bearish for bitcoin.  According to Sam Kazemian, the founder of Frax Finance, a decentralized cryptocurrency protocol whose frax stablecoin is backed by asset collateralization and cryptographic algorithms, a bear market for crypto marks a bull market for stablecoins.  ""In a bear market, stablecoins like frax and USDC are seen as cash,"" Kazemian told CoinDesk in a Zoom call.  Frax's circulating supply has increased by 63% to 2.62 billion in the past 30 days, the biggest percentage gain among the top 10 stablecoins by market capitalization, according to data source CoinGecko.  The market dominance of tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market value, has risen to 5%, the highest since July 2021. Meanwhile, USDC's dominance has more than doubled to a record 2.8% since November.

The California bank, which serves blockchain companies, had agreed last year to partner with Diem in launching a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. The agreement was supposed to breathe fresh air into a struggling project, which Meta Platforms had kickstarted under the name Libra in 2019 when the company was still called Facebook.  Diem was in discussions with investment bankers to sell its intellectual property to return money to investors, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.  As Libra, the project originally envisioned a stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies that could be used worldwide as a means of exchange. But it immediately spurred international regulatory backlash, with lawmakers demanding that all development cease until they could provide some regulatory guidance and ensure that it didn't threaten financial stability.

42396182,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT14TR,1643248046,A Struggling South Korean Museum Is Auctioning National Treasures; Meet the 2 DAOs Trying to Buy Them,"South Korea’s oldest private art museum will be auctioning two sculptures designated as “national treasures” by the South Korean government. Two decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) will be among the bidders on Thursday.  The DAOs – National Treasure DAO and HeritageDAO – formed independently of each other when South Korean media reported on the financially struggling Gansong Museum’s auction earlier this month. But they share a common goal: to prevent the artifacts from ending up in a private collection, where the public won’t be able to see them. The Gansong Museum has been closed since 2014 and has sold artwork to pay its debts. The museum told the Korea Herald that it hopes to reopen this year.  Both DAOs were inspired by ConstitutionDAO, the unprecedented and ultimately doomed attempt to buy one of the 13 original copies of the U.S. constitution. Although ConstitutionDAO was outbid by a billionaire, the initiative raised public awareness of DAOs by raising a whopping $40 million from thousands of hopeful investors. Post-ConstitutionDAO, people are spinning up DAOs to crowdfund big-ticket purchases, from golf courses to film scripts to Blockbuster.  The HeritageDAO and National Treasure DAO efforts are among the most ambitious and significant yet. The two sculptures, one of a miniature gilded bronze shrine with a Buddha inside is from the 11th century and the other of a gilded bronze triad of Buddhas that dates to the 6th century, are among fewer than 400 artworks that South Korea’s government has designated as national treasures.  According to the Korea Herald, Thursday will be the first time a South Korean museum has auctioned national treasures..  When Brian Cheong, founder of the Seoul Ethereum meetup and CEO of blockchain startup Atomrigs Lab, heard about the auction while watching television news, he was stunned.  “How come a national treasure is up for auction?” Cheong told CoinDesk. “I wanted to help somehow, but I don’t have that much money. I wanted to help with a community effort instead of just a few people’s donations.”  With help from Jason Han, the CEO of Ground X, the blockchain subsidiary of popular Korean texting app KakaoTalk, Cheong created National Treasure DAO.  But almost as soon as it started, the project faced a host of legal challenges.  Regulatory issues  Cheong heard about the auction on Jan. 17, leaving him only 10 days to create a DAO and find enough donors to raise his minimum goal of $4 million – enough to cover the floor cost and 15% auction fees for at least one of the statues.  “What can we do in 10 days?” Cheong said. “We cannot do a regular legal framework and set up an LLC. it would take another month to set up a legal entity. The best option was using crypto.”  “For fundraising, initially we thought about an ERC-20 token like ConstitutionDAO,” Cheong added. “We almost finished that initial contract coding but then several lawyers said, ‘Oh, no, no it’s very dangerous’ because the South Korean government still officially prohibits [initial coin offering] kinds of things.”  Cheong and his team instead raised funds via non-fungible tokens (NFT) minted on the Klaytn Blockchain, one of the most popular blockchains in South Korea. Cheong wrote smart contracts that ensured automatic refunds if the DAO didn’t reach its minimum funding goal by Jan. 26.  Cheong said that despite a whirlwind week of press engagements and over 30 articles and interviews about National Treasure DAO appearing in the Korean media, the DAO had raised only $2.1 million by the deadline and had already started issuing refunds.  Cheong blamed tightening crypto regulation in South Korea, which has seen nearly 70 exchanges shutter since September. Only a handful of crypto exchanges were able to meet new requirements set by the Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC), and of the surviving exchanges Cheong said that only two sell Klatyn’s native token. One made it nearly impossible to withdraw the crypto.  “This week, when we started to fundraise, Coinone prohibited exporting KLAY to MetaMask or other individual wallets,” Cheong said. “They only allow exporting to other exchanges’ accounts.”  Another approach  Leon Kim, the CEO of Crayon Finance – a new DAO-based NFT finance platform backed by Animoca Brands – founded HeritageDAO when he and his team were approached by “an anonymous expert in the fields of ancient and modern arts over a cup of tea” on Jan. 23.  Kim told CoinDesk he and his team pulled three consecutive all-nighters to create the DAO’s website and establish a treasury for the project using Juicebox (the same service used by ConstitutionDAO).  Fundraising opened to the public on Wednesday and Kim said the project had raised 553 ETH (valued at approximately $1.3 million) by the time of his interview with CoinDesk.  Like National Treasure DAO, HeritageDAO hopes to raise a base amount of $4 million, the value Kim estimates to meet the floor price for at least one statue and pay auction and legal fees. But he said the initiative may not need the full amount.  Kim told CoinDesk that HeritageDAO is speaking with the Gansong Art Museum to potentially strike a deal for less than the asking price. The Gansong could favor such a deal because both the HeritageDAO and the National Treasure DAO plan to leave the artifacts in the museum if one of them wins the auction. HeritageDAO expects to hear back from the museum by noon Korea Standard Time (03:00 UTC).  “They heard about us somehow,” Kim said. “So they're willing to talk about a direct, private kind of a deal.That way we might be able to secure [the statues] for a cheaper price.”  Unlike National Treasure DAO, HeritageDAO will keep raising money for a week, even if HeritageDAO doesn’t place the winning bid. Kim said that depending on how much money is raised, the DAO might attempt to buy the art from the auction winner or make a deal with the museum to purchase other art.  Fractionalized antiquities?  Though it has already begun issuing refunds, National Treasure DAO’s Cheong said that if the auction fails, the group could attempt a second fundraising round or, like HeritageDAO, try to make a private deal with the museum.  HeritageDAO’s Kim said owning a national treasure comes with responsibilities, including monitoring environmental temperature and lighting and reporting to the Cultural Heritage Administration, which strictly oversees art and artifacts of cultural significance.  Removing a national masterpiece from South Korea is illegal, so the list of potential buyers is small, he said.  “Obviously it’s not your everyday Picasso, because you can’t really enjoy it, per se,” Kim added. “So, like, it’s better off not to touch it.”  Despite the onerous rules of ownership, Kim believes the art is undervalued – and a worthy investment.  If HeritageDAO succeeds in buying one or both statues, Kim said it plans to “fractionalize the digital derivative of ownership” while the Gansong custodies and displays the actual statues.  “These national treasures have never had a chance to get a fair valuation, right?” Kim said. “So I think it's going to change a lot if we try this.”  DAOs in South Korea  Even if a billionaire chaebol snatches up the statues, both Kim and Cheong agree the publicity received by HeritageDAO and National Treasure DAO is a win for South Korea’s crypto scene.  “Korean people are not familiar with the DAO concept yet,” Cheong said. “Even though the crypto exchanges in Korea have [a large volume of transactions], people don’t have any individual crypto wallets like Metamask.”  “They’re all just using centralized exchange accounts,” Cheong added. “They have no idea of how DAOs work. I want to show them a working model that is efficient, that doesn’t have a lot of hassles…if we have problem, we can refund it automatically because everything controlled by a smart contract.”  Kim told CoinDesk the ongoing presidential election season in South Korea made the timing of the auction ideal because candidates are trying to win the votes of younger constituents by espousing crypto-friendly policies.  “We [want to be] a good reference and use case that’s actually helping all the parties involved,” Kim said.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/27/a-struggling-south-korean-museum-is-auctioning-national-treasures-meet-the-2-daos-trying-to-buy-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/672ea4b4ce9d36c5af8dcc461c2a9a87fe863445-6016x4016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
