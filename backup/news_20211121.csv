42424247,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2m5bh,1637537442,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Continues Drift Below $60K as Investors Eye Shoppers’ Inflation Response, Biden Fed Chair Pick","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin continues to drift below $60,000 as Biden tees up his pick for Federal Reserve chair.  Technician’s take: Momentum is still positive on a weekly basis, which is consistent with a bullish uptrend.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TVfor insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $59,172 -0.8%  Ether (ETH): $4,327 -1.81%  Market moves  Bitcoin continued to drift below $60,000, as cryptocurrency analysts looked ahead to a week of possible, reduced trading activity as a result of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. Ether held steady for much of the weekend above $4,300.  Investors following bitcoin as an inflation hedge will also look for an early read on how holiday shoppers are responding to the fastest consumer-price increases in three decades. That’s especially true as supply-chain bottlenecks stymie deliveries on some items while discouraging retailers from offering deep discounts.  Another highlight this week could come from an expected announcement from U.S. President Joe Biden for his pick to lead the Federal Reserve. The announcement could have implications for cryptocurrency industry regulation and monetary policy, although some experts say the two top candidates – current Chair Jerome Powell and Fed Governor Lael Brainard – are so similar in their policy positions that the choice may not make a big difference.  The weekend saw little evidence of any breakout from the recent market pattern, where bitcoin appears to be establishing a new price range around the pivotal $60,000 level.  “Prices will likely be contained, with a slight bearish bias,” the digital-asset firm Eqonex wrote Sunday in a newsletter.  A failure to hold above $58,850 could see prices drift down toward $56,670, and from there, “a deeper retracement” to $53,165 is possible, according to Eqonex. A move higher could quickly see prices trade up to $61,750, but gains are likely to be capped around $64,850.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Long-Term Uptrend Intact; Support Around $53K-$56K  Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing after a near 10% decline over the past week. The cryptocurrency is holding initial support above $56,000, although resistance around $65,000 could limit further upside over the short term.  The relative strength index (RSI) is oversold on intraday charts, which could encourage brief buying activity. On the daily chart, the RSI is approaching oversold conditions similar to late September, which preceded a price recovery.  On the weekly chart, bitcoin’s long-term uptrend remains intact given the upward sloping 40-week moving average. Momentum is still positive on a weekly basis, which is consistent with a bullish uptrend. And the monthly price chart shows no signs of upside exhaustion yet.  However, the weekly RSI is declining from overbought levels, albeit less extreme relative to January. This means bitcoin is vulnerable to higher volatility as buyers take some profits.  For now, bitcoin will need to hold support and sustain a breakout above $69,000 in order to yield an upside target toward $85,000.

42411644,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPM5a,1637513400,"Leverage Demand, Not Leverage Itself, Down in Bitcoin","Bananarama may have sung about a cruel summer, but November is turning out to be no great shakes for cryptocurrency investors, either. There are just six weeks left in 2021 and the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) dipped nearly 20% off an all-time high set Nov. 10.  Yet, there’s something interesting in one thing going in the markets right now: leverage. Or, rather, the recent drop-off in demand for it.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  After May’s miserable sell-off, the demand for borrowing money to go long on crypto took a hit as well. Bitcoin perpetual swaps funding rates – that is, the cost of holding a levered long position in the most liquid offshore derivatives markets – stayed largely negative through the end of July.  As prices began testing the $40,000 level at the end of July, funding rates began to tick up, and the market for perpetual swaps and futures grew. On Aug. 22, the combined open interest in bitcoin futures on BitMEX, Binance, Bybit, OKEx and Huobi broke above $10.4 billion, more than 50% higher than it was 90 days before, just after the May crash. Over the same period, the bitcoin spot price rose by about 30%.  After the spot market peak of $68,990.90 on Nov. 10 (per the XBX), prices fell and the funding rate plunged. Open interest did not. Between Nov. 10 and Nov. 18, aggregate open interest on bitcoin perp swaps and futures fell from $24.9 billion to $22.8 billion, according to Skew – about 8%, far less than the spot-market price drop over the same period. Compare that to the September dip (another drop of around 20% in the spot price). At that time, open interest fell 33% between the local high on Sept. 6 and the bottom on Sept. 27.  So it could be that the latest decline in bitcoin prices may be due not to deleveraging so much as just a lack of demand for leveraged-long positions.  “The balance on futures exchanges is decreasing (fewer collaterals) while open interest remains very high,” said data provider CryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju to CoinDesk. “There’s no cascade of short liquidations for now. I think the market is likely to go sideways in a broad range to cool off the futures market for the next few days.”  Options traders seem to agree: One-week at-the-money implied volatility in the bitcoin options market, at roughly 73%, is falling toward the rising 10-day realized volatility of 70%, noted Genesis Global Trading in a recent market comment. (Genesis, like CoinDesk, is a unit of Digital Currency Group.) That’s a sign that the market doesn’t expect anything extraordinary – at least, not by crypto market norms.  Some see bullish signals in the market for leverage. “A reduction in leverage smooths volatility,” Marc LoPresti, The Strategic Funds managing director, said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program on Nov. 18, amid a market lull. “That’s a good thing not only for institutional [investors] but for retail holders as well. I think that pattern will continue as we see less leverage usage … we’re going to see continued upside.”  Still, it hasn’t exactly plummeted. It’s still around where we were a month ago and well above what we saw over the summer. It’s been a fairly orderly decline over the past few days.  Lower rates may entice bitcoin bulls to place levered bets on a rally, but there’s still the threat of a sudden price move, bringing about another round of large liquidations.  In other words, to borrow from Ernest Hemingway, a fall in bitcoin price may happen gradually, then suddenly.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/21/leverage-demand-not-leverage-itself-down-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/217578561cd87285676116fc768b25aaf6a5cd1e-1280x640.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375821,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBe2h,1637470480,"El Salvador to Create ‘Bitcoin City,’ Use $500M of Planned $1B Bond Offering to Buy More Crypto","El Salvador, the only country in which bitcoin is a legal tender, is going to build an entire city based on the largest cryptocurrency by market value, President Nayib Bukele told a raucous crowd in a Saturday night presentation at Bitcoin Week in El Salvador.  “Bitcoin City” will be located along the Gulf of Fonseca near a volcano. The government plans on locating a power plant by the volcano to provide energy for both the city and bitcoin mining, the president said.  According to Bukele, Bitcoin City will be a full-fledged metropolis with residential and commercial areas, restaurants, an airport as well as a port and rail service. The city will be laid out in a circle (like a coin) and in the city center will be a plaza that will be host to a huge bitcoin symbol. The city will have no income, property, capital gains or payroll taxes.  Bukele also said El Salvador plans on issuing a $1 billion “bitcoin bond,” a tokenized financial instrument developed by Blockstream, on the Liquid Network. Of that amount, $500 million will be used to help construct needed energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure and $500 million to buy even more bitcoin. At the cryptocurrency’s recent trading price of about $59,000, that would bring the country’s treasury stash to about 9,500 bitcoins.  El Salvador intends to create a securities law and grant a license to Bitfinex Securities to process the issuance, Blockstream said in a release.  Samson Mow, Blockstream’s chief strategy officer, told the audience that the $1 billion in tokenized bonds will be 10-year and U.S.-dollar denominated and pay 6.5% initially. Following a lock-up period of five years, El Salvador will start to sell its cryptocurrency holdings and pay an added dividend to bond holders, Mow said.  By the time 10 years have elapsed the annual percentage yield will be 146%, Mow said, based on Blockstream models predicting the price of bitcoin will have hit $1 million within the next five years. Indeed, by using $500 million of the proceeds to buy bitcoin and locking it up for five years, El Salvador is hoping that by taking so much of the cryptocurrency out of circulation for so long it helps contribute to bitcoin’s price appreciation, Mow said.  El Salvador will become “the Singapore of Latin America,” Mow said.  UPDATED (Nov. 21, 15:03 UTC): Adds terms of the bond offering, comments from Blockstream CSO.  CORRECTED (Nov. 22, 20:23 UTC): Corrects number of bitcoin that El Salvador would hold to about 9,500.
