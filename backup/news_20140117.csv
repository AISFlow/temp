42376838,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecvH,1389982231,"Bitcoin is Not Legal Tender, Says Canada Government Official","A Canadian government official has said bitcoin is not considered legal tender in the country, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.  ""Only Canadian bank notes and coins are recognized as legal tender in Canada. Bitcoin digital ‘currency’ is not legal tender in Canada,"" the official reportedly wrote in an email.  The official from the Department of Finance, who was not named in the article, went on to say the federal government and Canadian regulators would ""continue to monitor developments involving virtual currencies"" but would not say whether the government would officially license fiat-to-digital currency exchanges in future.  While we've seen plenty of comments recently from governments around the world that bitcoin is not a ""currency"", this remark stands out in its use of the term ""legal tender."" However, recognition that a currency is not legal tender does not make bitcoin or any other payment method ""illegal"" as such.  Some Canadian businesses, especially those in tourist locations and near the US border, accept US dollars. Additionally, businesses are generally free to choose for themselves which payment types they will accept, so long as the income is reported for taxation purposes.  The WSJ report also quoted a Bank of Canada official as saying regulators would take a greater interest in bitcoin if it became large enough to pose a risk to the stability of the Canadian financial system, but would be less concerned if it remained a smaller, stand-alone payment system.  Bitcoin haven?  Canada has so far appeared to present a more permissive environment for bitcoin startups than the US, where businesses often need to register as money transmitters in each state separately.  Vancouver, British Columbia, was the site of the world's first two-way bitcoin ATM installation, which has been an enormous success for its US manufacturer Robocoin and Canadian partner Bitcoiniacs. A second machine opened for business in Toronto just this week. Further east, in Montreal, is the world's first and only Bitcoin Embassy and information center.  In late 2013, there was even some hope that the Canadian government would bestow some kind of legal recognition on bitcoin. A November fact sheet published by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), Canada's taxation agency, referred to bitcoin as ""virtual money"" and ""digital currency.""  The paper did, however, point out that bitcoin should be considered distinct from ""traditional currency.""  Money semantics  World government and central bank statements in the months since then have stressed that bitcoin is not a ""currency"" by any official definition, which usually includes only state-issued payment systems.  They have also shown a preference for the word ""virtual"" over ""digital."" While similar in meaning, especially in the technology world, the former term carries a subtle nuance of unreality.  The UK Royal Mint says of the term ""legal tender"":  ""Legal tender has a very narrow and technical meaning in the settlement of debts. It means that a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non-payment if he pays into court in legal tender.""  ""It does not mean that any ordinary transaction has to take place in legal tender or only within the amount denominated by the legislation. Both parties are free to agree to accept any form of payment whether legal tender or otherwise according to their wishes.""

42376831,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecnj,1389979796,UK's Official Financial Compensation Fund 'Doesn't Cover Digital Currencies',"The UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) has warned it won't provide compensation for lost digital currencies such as bitcoin and litecoin.  The FSCS pays compensation of up to £85,000 per account holder if their bank, building society or credit union is unable to pay claims against it.  This usually happens if the financial services firm in question has stopped trading. Mark Oakes, head of communications at FSCS said:  “FSCS protects up to £85,000 of depositors' money in savings and current accounts with UK authorised banks, building societies and credit unions. However, virtual currencies are not regulated by the UK regulators, so FSCS does not provide protection in the event of any losses suffered by consumers.”  The FSCS highlighted the European Banking Authority's (EBA) recent warning to consumers, which detailed the potential risks people are exposed to by using digital currency.  The warning largely focused on the possibility of fraud and theft.  “Consumers should be aware that exchange platforms tend to be unregulated and are not banks that hold their virtual currency as a deposit. Currently, no specific regulatory protections exist in the EU that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business,” the EBA said in a statement.  The UK government is yet to reveal its official stance on bitcoin, but HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC – the UK customs and tax department) last month backtracked on its previous classification of bitcoins as vouchers.  Richard Asquith, head of tax at professional services firm TMF Global, recently voiced his belief that HMRC will reclassify bitcoin as a ‘private currency’, but the department avoided addressing these comments.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/17/uks-official-financial-compensation-fund-doesnt-cover-digital-currencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8e1936381bd2434e89d56247d520a0c8f2b656f-1124x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376829,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecmT,1389976306,Romanian Presidential Candidate Accepts Bitcoin Donations,"A Romanian lawmaker has announced that he will be accepting bitcoin donations during his run for presidency.  Remus Cernea Constance is a flamboyant independent member of parliament and an avid secularist, known for his campaigns against discrimination based on religious affiliation, and for the separation of church and state. He is a former member of the Green Party and a campaigner for sustainable technologies.  Green bitcoins  The politician made headlines with his announcement on Thursday that his campaign would accept donations in the currency, saying:  “I’m the first politician in the world who has announced that his presidential campaign will accept donations in bitcoin. It is a world first as far as I know.”  So why did Remus Cernea decide to embrace bitcoin? He argues this is just the first step toward a transparently-funded campaign. He has already got his first donation from the owner of a Romanian Bitcoin trading platform, Horia Vuscan, reports Adevarul.  Writing on his Facebook page, Remus Cernea said bitcoin is a “revolutionary currency” as it does not depend on any state and is not issued by a central bank. “In general, it is already accepted in democratic countries with mature market economies,” he said.  Raising questions elsewhere  Although Romania is a relatively small economy, it already has a thriving bitcoin community. Hence, the decision to accept bitcoin donations will probably yield more in the way of public support than hard cash. Nonetheless, this seems like an interesting way of attracting support and press coverage.  Political donations are heavily regulated and restricted in almost every democratic country; bitcoin could be a way of going around these restrictions, due to its anonymity.  However, this should not be a problem in the US, where unlimited contributions were made possible by the Citizens United ruling, which allows wealthy donors, corporations and interest groups to throw unlimited monies to candidates willing to support their agenda.

42376847,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ed2p,1389972655,"The £150 ATM, Benefits of Risky Futures, and Bitcoin's Common Touch","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 17th January 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  ATM by numbers  Bitcoin ATMs are hotting up: Lamassu and Robocoin are making them, Taiwan's banned them, New York's thinking about licensing them, and now Skyhook's doing a $1,000 model that's open source – anyone who fancies making their own can do so using Skyhook's design.  But how much would that cost? Well, there's not very much in a bitcoin ATM. The most esoteric part is the note acceptor (called a bill acceptor in the US), the gubbins that gobbles up the banknotes and checks they're legit. Otherwise, you just need some sort of display and user control, a smidgeon of network, and a lump of computing to connect everything together.  John Law is quite handy with a soldering iron – the legacy of a mis-spent youth holed up in his bedroom when everyone else was out discovering beer and girls. He popped onto eBay to see how much note acceptors cost: you can get them for anything between twenty and a hundred quid – US prices are $40 to $120.  Although Skyhook hasn't said exactly how its ATM is put together, it has said that it uses a Nexus 7 tablethttps://www.google.co.uk/nexus/ (£120) and a Raspberry Pi (£20). You probably need the Pi because note acceptors are a bit fiddly to connect – they have all manner of odd signals, but the Pi is very good at that. The Nexus 7 is a bit posh; you can get a Chinese equivalent for £70 or so. All the networking comes for free with the Pi and the tablet.  Add £20 for the case and a power supply, and John Law reckons you can bring it in for around £150, if you try. If you're out to make a lot, then building some custom electronics to remove the tablet and the Pi will bring it down quite considerably.  Of course, you'll need the software to make it work – but with Skyhook promising to go open source, and the very lively developer communities out there, that's a matter of time, not money. Other cryptocurrencies can be supported as quickly as the right sliver of software can be written.  The very best bit is: you won't have to do any of this. Once the Skyhook plans are out there, there'll be a cottage industry in no time flogging kits and complete units for not much over the component cost.  Good luck to the authorities in trying to police a sea of cheap ATMs. Even if they do, there's nothing to stop enterprising sorts from just bolting a Bluetooth interface onto a note acceptor and selling that for £70 or so. Then, you provide your tablet or laptop with the right app, and you're away: there'll be no actual ATM to ban.  What next? Bitcoin slot machines? It can only be a matter of time.  Now you're being derivative ...  Something else that's just a matter of time is the bitcoin derivative market. Although they've got a reputation of late of being mostly a big boys' gambling den, derivatives are actually a very good way of divorcing risk from money – and nobody can deny that as money goes, bitcoin has more than its fair share of risk.  They're also pretty simple. Say you've got a business that makes saucepans from copper. You know you're going to need so much copper over the year, and you need to know how much you're going to pay for it so you can set a sensible price for your kitchenware. But the price of copper shifts quite a lot, in unpredictable ways.  What you do is agree to buy a fixed amount of copper in the future at a price agreed now. The person who's selling you the copper thus takes on the risk of the actual price going up too much – but also stands to make a bundle if the price collapses.  This sort of deal is also called futures trading, for obvious reasons. In exchange, you get to plan your year and can get on with making and selling pots at a fair profit. The derivatives trader makes their money by being an expert in risk. Result: happiness.  The problem of price swings is far, far worse for people who just want to trade bitcoins at a fair price, rather than speculate. Which is why Coinbase has been calling in Wired magazine for a properly regulated, all-grown-up derivatives market in BTC.  Isn't regulation against the spirit of bitcoin? Cool your jets, Randians: bitcoin itself isn't in the firing line – it's the markets derived from bitcoin that need the icy blast of official attention. People who sell derivatives need enough cash in the bank to cover their promises, or the innocents go to the wall. And there's been quite enough of that.  If that all works, bitcoin will become ever more attractive as a stable, usable currency for normal transactions. Isn't that rather the idea?  Buy it now  eBay UK  . Basketball games. Property. Flying lessons. Helicopter trips. Private jet hire. Spectacles. Criminal lawyering. Newspapers. Glaswegian fry-ups. Legal cannabis. Porn.  But enough about John Law's weekend (oh, he wishes – a trip to Lidl and a medium Americano were the real highlights. January, eh).  But if he had decided to enjoy the above through bitcoin, he'd be in luck: all these services have announced their cryptocurrency compatibility in the past seven days alone. Doubtless, there were many others.  The most exciting of the lot, though, is eBay UK. Although it hasn't gone as far as adding bitcoin to its acceptable payment methods for ordinary auctions and transactions, it is going to allow virtual currencies to be bought and sold through its classified section.  That's not quite the real eBay, as it's just a listing service, and you could already sell bitcoin there provided it was on a physical carrier like a USB key, but it's yet another fillip of respectability in an arena most of us use.  It's the trickling-down of bitcoin from the hipster, the elite and the weird that's going to matter in 2014. Not many of us will be hiring private jets this year, and hopefully few of us will be considering our choice of criminal lawyer, but we'll probably be looking at news over our bacon and eggs while waiting for the postie to deliver our latest eBay acquisition.  Which is why John Law is relaxed when professors of economics take to the FT to predict doom and misery for bitcoin as an investment – backed by the impeccable argument that ""There are no statistics available but one suspects that very few purchases of real goods are settled in Bitcoins.""  When the economists are against it, you know that something's going right.

42376825,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6echR,1389969035,US Senator Demands Regulatory Clarification on Digital Currencies,"US Senator Tom Carper yesterday called on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to clarify its position on digital currencies.  Carper is a Delaware Democrat and he currently heads up the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. It should be noted that Delaware is home to many credit card companies in the US, thanks to business-friendly regulations that have attracted numerous financial institutions to the state.  According to Bloomberg, Carper’s staff are already working on a report on digital currencies, scheduled for release sometime in the spring. Carper’s email to the CFTC was a response to an earlier letter from former CFTC chair Gary Gensler. He, in turn, was responding to an inquiry on digital currencies filed by Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.  No clampdown, potentially  The tone of Carper’s email is interesting: “Given that we read about a new venture in the digital currency space nearly every day, it is important that our government agencies respond appropriately and in a timely manner with thoughtful policy and oversight.”  “Those willing to take risks and play by the rules should have the opportunity to thrive without the fog of uncertainty.”  It appears that Carper isn't looking for a clampdown on digital currencies – he merely wants to eliminate any ambiguities.  Previously, the CFTC told Senator Coburn that the commission does have a set of policies and procedures specific only to digital currencies, the commission’s regulatory authority is limited, as it only extend to future and swaps contracts in any commodity.  Definition of a commodity  Former CFTC chairman Gensler told Coburn that his hands were essentially tied, although he did point out that the law has a broad definition of what a commodity is.  Despite that, Gensler did not reveal any plans to further regulate digital currencies, although he did mention the CFTC’s “broad enforcement powers”.  In other words, instead of eliminating ambiguity, it could even be argued that Gensler generated more of it, as it remains unclear whether the CFTC has the authority to regulate digital currencies in an effective fashion. Furthermore, it is unclear whether it is interested in doing so in the first place.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2014/01/17/us-senator-demands-regulatory-clarification-on-digital-currencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e37dfe27978492deb3f59b887c1dbf34d514b77-1000x669.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376834,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecsl,1389966345,London is Hosting its First 'Satoshi Square' Bitcoin Marketplace Tomorrow,"London will host its first Satoshi Square event tomorrow (18th January). Satoshi Square events are billed as face-to-face bitcoin exchanges for people to trade the cryptocurrency directly with one another in close physical proximity.  The London event has attracted more than 250 sign-ups on its Meetup event page. It's organised by Tom Robinson of Elliptic, the bitcoin insurance startup in the UK, and others involved in the London bitcoin scene.  Satoshi Square London will take place at Bishops Square, an open area next to the popular tourist destination Old Spitalfields Market. Bishops Square is also on the edge of the City of London, the city's historic financial district and the world's top location for trading in foreign exchange markets. Some 41% of the world's forex trades go through dealers in the City.  The London event is billed as an ""informal social affair"" with an emphasis on educating people new to bitcoin about the digital currency. Bitcoiners will meet under the white canopy located in the square to talk cryptocurrency, discuss the latest mining technology and trade bitcoins. The organisers have noted that there will be no formal stands set up to represent companies or individuals, although wifi networks are available.  The event seems to have successfully attracted some of its target audience. A Meetup user named Jacqui, for example, commented on the event page:  ""I understand the idea of cryptocurrency and the benefits ... I think it could be the future. It's the technical side which does not compute.""  Satoshi Square events grew out of a gathering of bitcoin enthusiasts in New York City last May. They are now a loosely affiliated global phenomenon. They were started by Josh Rossi, who convened a number of fellow enthusiasts at Union Square Park in downtown Manhattan, according to Let's Talk Bitcoin. The idea was to create an open-air marketplace for bitcoin.  Satoshi Square transactions are relatively small, as they are often venues for newcomers to bitcoin to get acquainted with the digital currency. However, the largest transaction at a Square event that Rossi knows of was for $10,000.  There are 16 bitcoin-related meetups listed for the UK on Meetup.com at the moment, up from six when CoinDesk last checked in August. Besides social events around bitcoin, users can also check LocalBitcoins for people to meet in real-life to trade BTC.

42376841,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ed0J,1389958257,Reality Keys: Bitcoin's Third-Party Guarantor for Contracts and Deals,"Brace yourselves for the next wave of bitcoin startups, and prepare to be surprised: they may not have much to do with bitcoin as a payment mechanism at all.  We usually see bitcoin as disruptive to the payments industry, as its technology greases the wheels of transaction, and eliminates the need for currency conversions and hefty fees.  We think of banks and credit cards. But just as we're getting used to that idea, the next wave of disruption is coming – with new targets.  This wave takes aim at those who hold money for us as guarantors for contracts or deals we've made: escrow companies, betting agencies and bookmakers.  Digital currency technology has the ability to secure and enforce a whole range of digital contracts all by itself, performing functions that have previously required a trusted (human) third party with access to the deal-makers' money.  Futures contracts, world event prediction exchanges, insurance, even your last will and testament can now be settled in this manner. If the subject of the agreement is something that can be factually proven with a specific time set for the decision, it's possible.  Future bets  Enter Reality Keys, a new service by Tokyo-based startup Social Minds due for public launch on 20th January. Reality Keys provides real-world data in a form that can be used to complete or disregard bitcoin transactions, based on quantifiable facts.  Users can request information on a range of subjects including: exchange rates, cryptocurrency transactions and data in the Freebasehttp://www.freebase.com/ open database, which lists 39 million topics covering everything in the known universe.  Users then specify a date at which they would like to confirm the status or outcome of a particular event, and two cryptographic public keys are provided: one for if the event happens and another for if it doesn't.  At the specified date, a private key is released corresponding to the outcome that occurred.  Social Minds' founder Edmund Edgar says he saw the potential for bitcoin to be used in this way after the failure of the original Intradehttp://www.intrade.com/v4/home/ prediction market, which closed last April with a $700,000 cash shortfall following the death of its CEO John Delaney on Mount Everest.  Intrade, which took bets in US dollars on real-world events and was known to be quite accurate at predicting them correctly, was also the subject of regulatory action by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Similar companies have since risen, like Predictious, which takes bitcoin bets on anything ""from presidential elections to the Oscars, to the sales of the iPad."" The catch is that you need to deposit your money with a third party, Predictious itself.  Use case scenarios  Two examples in which Reality Keys could be used are:  1) Currency hedging. You're an American importing wine from France. But fluctuating currency values hit your expenses hard as the Euro suddenly shoots up, and you must still pay your staff in US dollars.  2) Event prediction and betting. You'd like to put a wager on Hillary Clinton winning the 2016 presidential election.  In both scenarios you deposit a certain amount (let's say 1 BTC) into an address that required two of three keys to spend: your key, the other person's key, and the Reality Key for one of those scenarios becoming true (i.e., the US dollar is worth less than the Euro, or Hillary Clinton wins the election). If the prediction indeed comes true, the 1 BTC is paid to you. If not, and you lose, it's paid to your betting partner.  Math, not humans  ""The rise of bitcoin owes a lot to with the failure of trusted third parties that were supposed to be looking after our money for us,"" said Edgar.  ""But a lot of bitcoin services have ended up embracing the same model. I think we've seen enough people lose their hard-earned bitcoins to prove that this model has to change.""  By limiting its role to providing data and making it usable on the block chain, Reality Keys empowers users to create their own digital contracts and transact directly with each other.    It is all, of course, anonymous. Reality Keys provides only the keys, and has no interest in or knowledge of the nature of the contract or the amounts of bitcoin at stake.      ""I wouldn't even call it a platform – just an information service,"" Edgar continued.    Layer upon layer (if you want)  Should one layer of digital signature protection not be enough, they can even structure their transactions to use additional signatures provided by other external parties, providing layers ""as deep as you like"" of assurance that don't depend on Reality Keys or any other single company or individual.  Edgar said that, although this capability has existed within the bitcoin protocol for a while, it is limited by a lack of software client support and the logistics of brokering and setting up transactions. Blockchain.info supported multi-signature transactions for a short while but has since withdrawn the feature, citing low usage.  ""The community's been suffering from a chicken-and-egg problem where we don't have services set up to broker multi-signature transactions because the clients don't support it, but the clients don't support it because there aren't enough services to make use of it.""  ""We decided to go ahead and build our little part of the infrastructure we think the community needs, so people working on the other parts can build their parts too,"" he added.  Edgar sees most use of the service to come via its ""simple, really accessible API,"" as developers build it into their own projects. It can also be used directly through its own web interface.  Reality Keys is free for anyone to use, but charges a fee if you somehow require human intervention (e.g., if a data source like Freebase produces incorrect information that needs correction).  Edgar said he is keen to expand the service to provide other kinds of data for a potentially huge ecosystem of peer-to-peer distributed markets.  ""Our service doesn't really care what data it is providing. If you can point us to a data source with a public API and reasonably friendly Terms of Service, we can monitor it and plug it into the block chain,"" he concluded.

42376832,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecqF,1389952238,Picturesque English Farm Takes Bitcoin for Wedding Parties,"A farm in the bucolic English countryside will now accept bitcoin payments from wedding parties seeking to hire the venue for their special day.  The farm, a three-acre property called the Loudwater Estate Event Centre in Hertfordshire, South East England, charges charges £2,000 (or 2.359 BTC – according to the current CoinDesk BPI) for an all-day venue rental.  The estate's owner, John Michell, said he started accepting bitcoin payments a week ago and is yet to make his first sale. However, he is confident the right couple will be enamoured by the 17th-century barn and idyllic views of the River Chess, which winds through the property. He said:  ""I think it might be somebody from abroad, perhaps China, who thinks: Wow, this is in England; we can go and pay in bitcoin, turn up, and have a wedding there!""    Boosting bitcoin consumption    Michell is boosting his chances of finding the right matrimonially-inclined bitcoiners because he runs a number of cryptocurrency-related activities at his farm. Michell runs regular seminars around bitcoin to introduce the digital currency to would-be bitcoin investors.  Michell charges 0.051 BTC for a seat at the workshop (or a premium in fiat for £25) where he gives an overview of the digital currency to attendees. His next event is on 25th January and he expects a group of several dozen attendees.  In addition, Michell said he is working to set up a bitcoin exchange aimed at UK residents. He has incorporated a company in Germany that will have an account with Munich-based Fidor Bank.  The bank is well known for its positive approach to bitcoin. It already works with digital currency exchange Kraken and German bitcoin marketplace bitcoin.de. Michell said:  ""It's so difficult in England to buy bitcoin. We want to offer people in the UK the chance to buy bitcoin via the German system.""  Michell noted that potential customers at his exchange would still have to deposit funds into a German bank account. He said he would not have the ability to take deposits with a UK account, as banks have been less open to the prospect of working with bitcoin exchanges.    When opportunity knocks    Michell has a background in financial technology. Previously, he was a developer of financial enterprise software for banks: working at Bank of America in London and the FIAT Bank in Germany.  [post-quote]  Mitchell said he bought his first bitcoin for £15. He discovered cryptocurrencies when he found a server he had been running had been hacked. The attacker, who he said was based in Russia, had taken over part of the server for litecoin mining.  ""I cleaned it up, asking myself, 'What are these things?' Then I spent months studying bitcoin and all of a sudden, a light went on, and I thought: '[Bitcoin] is amazing. It's going to take over the world.'""  The technology developer-turned-wedding venue entrepreneur said he experienced a similar epiphany in 1995, when he evangelised about the Internet at a talk given to the Institute of Directors in London. At the time, Michell was director of a company called Millenium Facilities in Cambridge, where he charged small firms £100 to help them get connected to the Internet.  One of his clients was sufficiently impressed by the nascent global network to ask Michell to give a talk about it. He recalled:  ""This was just after Mosaic had come out, before Netscape, even. I said the biggest application on the Internet is going to be finance. And of course, it's only now that bitcoin is the Internet of money, and it's going to be massive.""  Michell became the owner of Loudwater Estate after hearing that it was available from his daughter, who worked there. His daughter currently manages the daily operations at the estate.

42376842,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ed1Z,1389942134,US Government Announces it Will Sell $25 Million Worth of Silk Road Bitcoins,"The 29,655 bitcoins seized by US law enforcement agents from defunct online black market Silk Road will be liquidated by the US government, a 16th January press release from the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York confirmed.      US District Judge J. Paul Oetken signed off on the forfeiture order on Thursday, clearing the government to sell the assets, which as of press time are worth more than $25m.      While no timetable for the sale was issued, the development brings the government one step closer to unloading its Silk Road holdings, estimated to be 1.5% of all bitcoins, onto the general market. The US Attorney's Office also estimated the value of the stash a little higher.      Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara, whose agency is prosecuting the case against alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht, said:    “With today’s forfeiture of $28 million worth of bitcoins from the Silk Road website, a global cyber business designed to broker criminal transactions, we continue our efforts to take the profit out of crime and signal to those who would turn to the dark web for illicit activity that they have chosen the wrong path. These bitcoins were forfeited not because they are Bitcoins, but because they were, as the court found, the proceeds of crimes.""  Ulbricht's stash remains    His filing halts, at least temporarily, efforts by the government to sell the contested coins and could help guard against the consequent price drop many market observers fear.      The 29-year-old was arrested in October for ""intentionally and knowingly"" violating US narcotics law. The Pennsylvania State University graduate was also charged with possessing controlled substances and committing or conspiring to commit computer hacking offenses, among other charges.      Since the arrest, Silk Road's notoriety has only grown. A copycat organization called Silk Road 2.0 went live soon after its demise, and an as-yet-unscripted movie is in the works about Ulbricht and the murders-for-hire he is alleged to have plotted in the course of his business.    Questions remain    While the US government has announced its intention to sell the seized bitcoins, its path to the sale is less clear.      “We have not yet determined exactly how the bitcoins will be converted and liquidated,” Manhattan US Attorney Office spokesperson Jim Margolin told Forbes.      This hasn't stopped speculation as to which exchange, if any, could profit from exposure to the high-profile sale. Forbes' Kashmir Hill suggests the government could also choose to sell its bitcoin assets in a more familiar manner.      ""It's likely that the US Marshals will instead auction off the bitcoins as if they were Bernie Madoff's penthouse or a drug dealer's cars. The proceeds will go to the US Treasury,"" Hill wrote.    Market effects    At press time, the price of bitcoin remained stable, but previous Silk Road developments have had a significant effect on value. The initial announcement of the Silk Road shutdown in October caused bitcoin values to plummet from about $125 to below the $100 mark, before eventually recovering.    Fears of a large-scale decline in prices is rampant among Reddit users, who worry that a quick sell off would significantly reduce prices. Other observers are more optimistic, predicting a short dip in prices, followed by an influx of capital from investors purchasing undervalued bitcoin.  The Silk Road website was also forfeited, bringing the site's short and turbulent life to an end.
