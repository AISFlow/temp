42431647,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Ynh,1584395695,"Retail Investors Are Buying the Bitcoin Institutions Are Selling, Traders Say","As institutions unload bitcoin (BTC) along with stocks as part of the coronavirus-driven global sell-off, cryptocurrency’s traditional base – retail investors – is doing most of the buying, market participants said.      And while pricing screens may still be flashing red, business is brisk at many trading platforms.      “We've already done more volume in March than all cumulative volume previously,” said River Financial CEO Alex Leishman, head of a bitcoin-centric brokerage in San Francisco that launched three months ago. “About 20 percent of all of our clients have signed up this month. ... We're seeing record interest from first-time bitcoin buyers.”      River Financial is relatively small, with just under 10,000 active user accounts, but this volume surge appears to be rippling across markets. Gemini’s head of communications, Carolyn Vadino, confirmed the New York-based crypto exchange saw a surge in activity over the weekend.      “During this time of market uncertainty, we continue to expect to see higher volumes than normal,” Vadino said.      Likewise, one over-the-counter (OTC) trader in Latin America, who provides liquidity to several of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, said his desk has seen “two to three times” the normal buy orders since the price dropped dramatically on Thursday.      “You still have a lot of people who are long that are trying to get out,” said the trader, who did not want to be named. “It’s more related to hedge funds liquidating than anything else. ... There’s a lot of bitcoin-collateralized dollar loans out there to miners or people who are long crypto.”      See also: Bitcoin Is Now Undervalued, Suggests This Price Metric    Imbalance    Another U.S.-based OTC trader confirmed that companies with heavily leveraged loans played into the wave of institutional investors selling off. Yet, retail traders are buying up bitcoin so aggressively that it’s throwing the whole market off, according to the anonymous trader in Latin America.      “I hope this doesn’t stay so long because it could be damaging. We all need some type of volume to survive,” he said.      In short, if more people are buying than selling, trading or leveraging it will be tricky for liquidity providers like himself to profit from arbitrage. This would pressure exchanges to find new market makers, or force market makers themselves to try different strategies. No one quite knows how that would play out if it happens over several months.      “It’s basically half the volume that was trading [when bitcoin was priced] at $9,000, even if it’s the same amount of bitcoin changing hands,” he said.    Volatility    Exchanges like BitMex were briefly overloaded during a period of dramatic volatility last week, experiencing an hour-long outage. According to the analytics firm Skew, BitMex and OKEx alone facilitated nearly $10 billion in bitcoin futures trades on Thursday, March 12.      However, OKEx Financial Markets Director Lennix Lai said it doesn’t make sense for any significant exchange to implement a “circuit breaker,” which automatically halts trading on their platform if rapidly falling prices cripple the system.      “If one major exchange has a circuit breaker while the others keep on trading, the sell-off pressure would simply transfer to another exchange,” Lai said.      See also: Governments Face Trade-Offs on Privacy in Fight Against Coronavirus      As such, smaller brokerages like Leishman’s are focused on preparing their back-end selling mechanisms for unprecedented traffic.      “You can’t choose when volatility hits and the orders start coming in,” Leishman said. “Almost all of our orders have been buy orders. ... We need to make sure the prices we are promising users don't lose us money but are fair.”      On the other hand, at least traders at OTC desk Cumberland don’t appear to be concerned about long-term instability.      “In our role as a liquidity provider, we continue to see both buying and selling from our counterparties,” a Cumberland spokesperson said. “Including those who have been sitting on the sidelines for a while using this as an opportunity to re-engage in the market.""

42404205,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdha7Q,1584388362,Ethereum Community Grapples With Coronavirus as EthCC Cases Tick Upward,"Over a dozen Ethereum fans who participated in the EthCC conference in Paris during the first week of March have since tested positive for coronavirus, according to public lists compiled by attendees.      At least six hospitalized attendees have used these lists to alert the community so far. The lists, including real names and symptoms, have not been confirmed in full by CoinDesk. ""This instinctive and dutiful radical transparency may change behaviours and save lives,” list creator Justin Drake tweeted.      One anonymous EthCC attendee in her 20s who tested positive for COVID-19, but may have contracted the virus from her partner at home who also tested positive, said there weren’t many precautionary measures at the event in Paris. The event was planned by the nonprofit Ethereum France and staffed by volunteers from ConsenSys and other crypto companies.      “There were a few people with masks and hand sanitizer, but not many,” she said. “Most of the EthCC attendees were young and still thinking the virus wouldn’t affect them.”      She added she was hospitalized for two days after returning to the U.S., and is still quite ill. She is not listed on the documents currently being circulated, suggesting the infection count from the event are likely higher.      “The one thing they don't tell you about is it basically makes it so you’re not able to breathe … it basically feels like you are drowning,” she said of the respiratory disease. “I’m really surprised that EthCC wasn’t canceled and the whole thing held virtually. … I think it should have been completely virtual.”      ConsenSys Labs investor Min Teo tweeted that anyone who attended the conference, regardless of symptoms, should self-quarantine. Along those lines, another anonymous EthCC attendee said he wished the Ethereum Foundation would take a more active approach in warning event organizers.      This raises questions about leadership and responsibility across the ecosystem, an anonymous EthCC attendee told CoinDesk.      “I believe there was a responsibility from the EF to warn people early not to gather at upcoming conferences, especially since people were also sick at ETHDenver,” he said. “I get that the EF doesn't control EthCC or EthGlobal, but perhaps a warning from the leadership early on?”      The crowdsourced lists may be a step in the right direction for stopping further spread of the disease. However, Claire Brindis, co-director of USCF’s National Adolescent and Young Adult Health Information Center, said such lists could actually put people at even greater risk down the line.      “In particular, when we see the type of xenophobia we have these days, people on such lists could be endangered,” Brindis said. “I anticipate there could be unexpected, negative ramifications. I would want to be notified if I have been exposed, but not in a public venue like this. I’m worried about how people might use this information against others.”    Ecosystem ripples    For some ethereum fans, this outbreak raises questions about community leadership.      “The Bitcoin community doesn't suffer from this issue of having a leader figure that can impact Bitcoin's ecosystem,” the anonymous male attendee said. “I hope this will change the way these things [Ethereum events] are run. It seems like the [Ethereum] leadership needs to be more aware of global issues happening.”      As for ConsenSys, spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, the company issued a public statement saying it is “well-positioned to weather this disruption and maintain business continuity” because of its remote-first company policy. Obviously, company travel and meetups are now going fully virtual, including the firm’s banner Ethereal event in New York in May.      Although Lubin and other ConsenSys executives are noticeably absent from public infection lists, some list participants remain anonymous.

42404219,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhaJE,1584386153,"SingularityNET, Ocean, Algorand, Triffic, Enigma Add To Fight Against Coronavirus","Well, that escalated quickly. As we catch our breaths with the pace of COVID-19-related disruptions, this post will update frequently with the latest perspectives, support efforts and information from the blockchain community at large. Have something to add? Tweet @CoinDesk with #CoronaEfforts.      COVID Hackathon    SingularityNET and Ocean Protocol, decentralized AI and data economy projects respectively, have pooled resources to support a COVID-19 hackathon initiative.      Decentralized AI Alliance (DAIA), an organization of more than 50 companies, labs, and nonprofits, will host the event, which aims to develop and launch open-source code and tools that can be leveraged by the medical community in their fight against COVID.      The hackathon will continue for eight weeks, and pursue solutions in data privacy, epidemiology and medicine, informational tools, and open innovation, according to a statement.      “By freely sharing data and AI on a global scale, technologists can bring their special talents to bear and get ahead of this menace to defeat it,” Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol cofounder, said in a statement.      “From aiding with biomedicine and epidemiology to ensuring that data privacy is respected as the pandemic is tracked and studied, to creating democratically-evolving tools for sharing information and helping people cope – the number of ways AI can support in this unprecedented situation is vast,” Ben Goertzel, chairman of DAIA and CEO of SingularityNET, said in a statement.      Prior to launch, more than 100 people have signed on to support the initiative, including members of DAO management platform Aragon, bio-analytics firm Shivom, and p2p blockchain NEM.      Algorand Coronavirus Survey    The Algorand Foundation launched a health survey website to record public health trends during the novel coronavirus pandemic.      The site allows infected people to record their experiences anonymously, and will use the Algorand blockchain to protect the data for posterity.      Called the iReport-Covid app, the idea is to “get health data from more sources than just government authorities,” said Hugo Krawczyk, Algorand Foundation researcher.      “We think blockchains are a good way of recording information and it’s accessible if you want to do statistics...if in 10 years you want to research the virus you will have this data available,” he said.    Toilet paper to WHO?    An augmented reality gaming app, Triffic, is set to donate $10,000 to the World Health Organization (WHO).      Usually, the app rewards players in GPS tokens, its native cryptocurrency, for moving about the world and collecting “beacons,” or virtual representations of real-world objects. Now that millions are under lockdown, the gameplay has been modified to spawn beacons – in the form of virtual toilet paper rolls, hand sanitizers, and face-masks – directly in player locations.      For every item collected, Triffic will donate the token’s value to the WHO COVID-19 Response Fund. According to a blogspot, the apps creators have already sold 600,000 GPS for cash, to ensure donations retain a stable value.      Fundraising will stop on either April 30, or when all tokens have been collected. Donations, which the app’s creators say will be verifiable, will be paid out in lump sum on May 1.    Project N95    Project N95 is a web-based clearinghouse for medical grade equipment.      The platform serves as a medium to connect rapid response teams and hospitals with manufacturers of desperately-needed personal protective equipment (PPE).      “We are working with governments to determine where demand is and where it is most urgent,” reads the Project N95 website. “This is a tool designed to gather data as efficiently as possible to assist in distribution efforts.”      The platform takes in requests directly from hospitals and governments to help aggregate demand, as well as vets equipment manufacturers, to best execute distribution.      They’re also looking for volunteers.    SafeTrace    Tor Bair’s Enigma, a data encryption firm, has developed a platform to facilitate privacy-preserving contact tracing for COVID-19.      Called SafeTrace, the platform aims “to help protect public health while also protecting individual privacy,” Bair wrote in an email.      As observed by some nations – like South Korea or Singapore – ability to “flatten the curve,” fighting a pandemic requires reams of data. This comes both from wide-spread testing, as well detailed maps of infected persons movements.      “Some of the measures being used to combat COVID-19, specifically contact tracing, involve significant privacy compromises that pose risks even when participation is voluntary,” Bair said. SafeTrace counters this by providing a secure, open-source backend to upload and encrypt this sensitive personal information.       The platform is loosely based on the existing Enigma protocol. Within a secure enclave, all the reports are collated and compared providing:      1. A “local view,” which is an individual report showing users where and when they’ve overlapped with individuals who have since tested positive      2. A “global view” heat map that can help us better understand and curtail the spread of disease caused by COVID-19.      Bair said they are looking for epidemiologists, health professionals, rust programmers, developers and engineers, and other volunteers to help out. Check here to see if it’s the right project for you.    Ran Neuner’s $10M lifeline    Ran Neuner, CNBC Africa’s “Cryptotrader,” has launched a $10 million fund to assist startups in dire straits due to market disruption.       “As an entrepreneur that has built and exited several businesses, I am aware that some startups may change the world but they need to survive this,” Neuner said in an email. “I know that runways are short and that if we don’t do something , most won’t survive.”       “I want to do my part by raising funds and tapping into our network for entrepreneurs that need some guidance in this time,” he added.       Neuner will also use his connections to “highly successful business people” to provide mentorship during this period of economic turmoil. These free sessions will be conducted via Zoom, as to comply with recommended or mandated “shelter-in-place” statutes.       Partnered with ex managing director of Techstars blockchain Yossi Hasson, Neuner aims to increase his fund’s largesse to between $50 and $100 million. “For now we have invested our own cash and that of high net worth individuals. We are raising more money every day,” Neurner said.       While primarily focused on assisting blockchain or crypto firms, Neuner is also looking for opportunities to support startups in “other exciting industries.”       There are a few specific requirements. “We are not looking for ideas but rather companies that have raised money previously and are burning through it. The companies must be going-concerns and have a monthly burn,” Neuner said.     Perspective: Giacomo Zucco    ""Even if I'm theoretically ""at the epicenter,"" I don't know of anybody sick with the disease, in my extended social circles, and have not been affected from a health-related point of view personally. But I am heavily affected in day-to-day life.       When this unprecedented and draconian Italian mass-home-detention started, I finally decided to get back and ""turn myself in,” in order to stay close to my parents and parents-in-law. Paradoxically, it’s been a happy month with my family. We’re spending a lot of time together with our 2 years old daughter, and there’s been a steep reduction in work-related stress. (More on that later.)       Though a lot of friends and relatives – especially the self-employed ones, and the small entrepreneurs – are now unemployed and without any income. A lot of local enterprises are already financially crippled beyond repair.       The psychological effects of imprisonment are starting to show: We have relatives and friends showing occasional breakdowns.       My professional life has also been impacted negatively. I can't really monetize remote Bitcoin-related consultancies and workshops as I did with physical ones, and being in a reduced space with a small child I can only really enter remote sessions a few hours every night when there is silence.""     Binance Charity Gives Globally    CZ Changpeng Zhao’s “one tweet” could lead to $1 million in charitable donations.      According to a public announcement, Binance Charity will match $1 donations to retweets of “this post” tagged with #CryptoAgainstCOVID.      The charity will make an upfront donation of $1 million in BUSD, and set up a wallet for other to give. It’s unclear where the money will eventually go, though Binance intends to buy supplies directly and send them to “targeted hospitals in affected countries,” according to a blog post.       “The most important element of human life is to show compassion and help others as we can, without the limitation or restriction of borders. Blockchain technology enables this in greater capacities than ever before and Binance Charity wishes to bring this to the masses,” said Helen Hai, Head of Binance Charity, said in a statement.      Additionally, if there is 1 million retweets within 7 days (originally posted on March 25), the charitable wing of the world’s largest crypto exchange will redouble its donations.      Binance started charitable giving early, having reportedly launched the “Binance for Wuhan” project in Dec. 2019. That effort committed to a donation of $10,000,000 RMB ($1.4 million) worth of supplies, shipped to over 300 hospitals and medical teams in various Chinese cities.    Coinbase Shuts Soon, Gives Early    In early February, Coinbase ordered more than 1,000 N95 masks for its employees, as one of the earliest companies to take a strong stance on the looming coronavirus threat.      This mentality led the firm to close its offices in early March.      “We never got to use [the N95 masks] because we started WFH two weeks ago,” Peter Jihoon Kim, a head of engineering at Coinbase, tweeted. But this wasn’t a tragic waste of personal protective equipment.      MIT Privacy Tracker    Governments need accurate information related to how the virus has been transmitted interpersonally. Many, including China and Israel, have turned to using GPS data collected by their citizens’ mobile phones to identify people who have crossed paths with an infected individual.      These “contact-tracing tools... can also be – and have been – used to expand mass surveillance, limit individual freedoms and expose the most private details about individuals,” write the team behind Private Kit, an open-source, “contact tracing” app.      This team of epidemiologists, engineers, and data scientists – led by MIT Media Lab Professor Ramesh Raskar – built a free, privacy-protecting app that can be used to track the spread of COVID-19, using mobile phones.      Users opt in to sharing their data with healthcare professionals (which also offers a “location trail” based on actual movements, rather than memory). These healthcare workers then redact all personal identifying information and added to a database.      If a Private Kit user has crossed paths with an infected individual, the app will alert them.    Crypto Charity Launch    The Giving Block crypto charity drive launched today.      The #cryptoCOVID19 Alliance will give donations made in crypto to nonprofit partners including      Save the Children, No Kid Hungry, Us4Warriors, among others.      “Today, donating cryptocurrency is not just a way to lower our taxes. It is our chance to protect the people we love, all while telling the new crypto story. To turn sideways glances into admiration. Today we write the first page of our story. Help us squash this bug,” Alex Wilson, The Giving Block CEO, writes in a statement.      Gitcoin Giving    Gitcoin, part of ConsenSys, will match up to $110,000 in donations made in ether or DAI, though the charitable drive will also accept donations in bitcoin, litecoin, zcash and other cryptocurrencies.      Gitcoin’s participation is part of its larger grant drive, where $250,000 will be gifted to projects growing the Ethereum community.      This round, a special $100,000 is earmarked for crypto projects addressing public health, specifically, “all COVID-19 related projects focused on research, response, and recovery efforts within communities.”      Pulled together by Scott Moore, technical growth lead at ConsenSys’s Gitcoin, the project is a twin to The Giving Block’s larger charity drive.      “We’re hopeful that with this infrastructure, although it’s just the crypto community’s small contribution, we can help many of these public health projects get at least $10K [sic] to use immediately towards their efforts,” Vivek Singh, chief operating officer at Gitcoin, blogged.      “If you don’t have the means to donate, we encourage you to share the hashtag #cryptocovid19 across your feeds!”    Unqualified aggregation?    Messari, a crypto data aggregator, added a new resource to keep track of coronavirus statistics.      This curated feed, called COVID-19 Tracker, collects information related to the virus’s progression and regression in all 50 states, several territories, and the Grand Princess cruise ship.      “I’ve been monitoring the coronavirus since Feb 1,” Messari founder Ryan Selkis wrote in a blog unveiling the data source. “I am not a doctor/expert, but have been ahead of many of them on this.”      The webpage also provides curated links from news and government sites, as well as excerpts taken from Selkis’s daily newsletter, Unqualified Opinions.      Earlier today, Selkis alerted the crypto community that he has been “shadow banned,” or temporarily restricted from Twitter.      ”I believe it's from our COVID-19 coverage, and we're now being limited as if we'd been reporting on this like ZeroHedge,” Selkis said, referring to the newsource blocked from Twitter in February.    JSTOR opens the door    JSTOR, the not-for-profit online hub for academic research, has made selections of its holdings public.      Usually hidden by a severe paywall, the database has turned over 6,000 ebooks and over 150 journals for public use.      In a statement on its website, JSTOR said the move is taken to assist “students have been displaced due to COVID-19.” The resources will remain available until the end of June, and may grow to include more than 20,000 books for institutions that do not participate in an existing book program.      Prior to taking his own life, internet activist Aaron Swartz used JSTOR to download and republish 5 million academic journal articles through MIT's computer network. Swartz was later charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.      “The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations,” Swartz wrote in the 2008 Guerilla Open Access Manifesto.    Basement-made shields    A couple living in upstate New York is contributing 300 face shields to the state’s coronavirus efforts.      Isaac Budmen and Stephanie Keefe, owners and operators of 3D printing firm Budmen Industries, are able to produce these protective masks in mass quantities, all from their basement.      According to local news site Syracuse.com, the couple designed the shields after learning the county would open a coronavirus testing site.      With hundreds more shields on the way, Budmen said, “We’re really not looking to make money off the county in this crisis. We’re just sort of looking to get through it as fast as we can.”    Virtual viewing rooms    The art world has gone virtual. As the spread of the coronavirus forces museums to close indefinitely, a number have taken their galleries online.      Art Basel, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Pace are among the many that now offer virtual viewing rooms, according to the New York Times. Art Basel alone has uploaded 2,000 masterpieces, worth some $270 million.      Digital galleries “feel personal, they feel intimate,” Jeff Koons, pop artist, told the Times. “I love looking at images. I can be just as happy to look at an image of a Manet painting online. It’s really about the stimulation that a work has for you.”    NanoHack  NanoHackhttps://copper3d.com/hackthepandemic/ is an open-source respirator that leverages distributed manufacturing and 3D printing to ease the demand shock in medical-grade face masks.  The idea is to create a reusable, recyclable and form-fitting mask by mass printing components to be assembled at home. The company alleges the “ copper nanocompositehttps://copper3d.com/hackthepandemic/pdf/Patent_Description3D.pdf%5C” material is antimicrobial.    It’s unclear if the masks are currently in production, or which decentralized distribution channels are in use. NanoHack did not respond to a request for comment by press time.    Together, we have the power to use the latest technology in ways that make an immediate and lasting humanitarian impact in local communities and across the globe.  Covid, Code, Challenges    IBM will expand its developer competition aiming to solve the world’s most pressing issues – from climate change to crisis communications – through code, to include COVID-19.      The “Call for Code Global Challenge” offers winners $200,000 in cash, reports Venture Beat.      “We are working with some of the world’s leading experts to define the most pressing needs and provide the most helpful resources,” IBM said in a statement. “Together, we have the power to use the latest technology in ways that make an immediate and lasting humanitarian impact in local communities and across the globe. Thank you for answering the call in this unprecedented time in our history.”    Orchid wants journos using VPN    Orchid, the decentralized VPN provider, is courting journalists as China and other countries use the coronavirus crisis to expel members of the press.      “We are making Orchid available for free to all journalists in order to ensure they are able to access and transmit accurate information, no matter where in the world they are,” the company wrote in a Friday blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance. “If you are a journalist, email amanda@orchid.com with the name of your publication and proof of your status, to get set up and receive a personal onboarding.“      The token-powered privacy project raised roughly $48 million from a slew of big-name backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Blockchain Capital, Polychain Capital and Sequoia. The network and its OXT token launched in December.      Orchid sees the coronavirus-induced shift to remote work as an opportunity to attract new customers.      “This is the first time many people around the world will be working remotely on a regular basis,” the company wrote. “We know that Internet privacy tools can be crucial for workers in sensitive industries and/or geographies, and we understand that the need to work remotely for an extended period is likely to cause significant disruption.”      As such, the company says it will prioritize its desktop app in the months ahead as people log onto their laptops to work from home.    Collab19/Uniswap    Have you ever wondered how DAOs could be deployed to beat the pandemic? Well, Collab19 has your answer.      “By creating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) people from all over the world can come together to fight COV-19,” according to Collab19’s website, where philanthropic individuals are instructed to buy the DAO’s tokens “to help the DAO decide which charities to donate to!”      Like other decentralized autonomous financial bodies, Collab19 is governed by token-economics. Of 1,400 C19 (the native token on the platform) tokens created, the DAO will keep half. The rest will be put on a Uniswap pool.      On a weekly basis the DAO will cash out 100 tokens to be purchased on Uniswap, and then used to vote on how to spend the remaining DAO treasury on charitable efforts.      “Most charities don't know how to deal with crypto so we are thinking of using a trusted facilitator to handle crypto to fiat conversion,” James Young, cofounder of Abridged, wrote in a Telegram channel.      Young is also working on another DAO using MolochV1, where users can pool their DAI, and the interest will be used to fund covid19 tests, he said. “[I’m] calling it ""testTogether.” Will launch next week.”    Hive of epidemiologists    No, the loudest blue check on Twitter is not an epidemiologist. While social media has become a go-to source for information during these confusing times, it’s becoming evident that some people are speaking out of hand.      Hive, a group of “crypto-minded researchers, engineers, designers” and fans of the space that scores and ranks trustworthy social accounts has developed another algorithm to map the actual epidemiologists to follow.      Hive.one epidemiologists ranks 100 accounts that can speak authoritatively on the crisis, during this moment where it seems like no one is in charge.    Hackaday.io    Hackaday.io is a website for people to collaborate on hardware development.      During the coronavirus crisis, a number of open-source campaigns have started, seeking ways to build anything from solar-powered battery packs to positive air pressure respirator (PAPR) devices.      Mike Rigsby even as a tool that prevents people from touching their face. His project, “Don't Touch Face,” activates a buzzer when you lift your arm “to let you know that your hand is causing trouble.”    Computational assist    Researching and developing vaccines in the 21st century requires an incredible amount of computational power.      Developers at LiquidApps have stepped up with a potential solution for underpowered labs. Called CoVax, this app will harness the spare processing power of personal computers around the world to assist vaccine research.      “Processing power is essential for computational-heavy tasks involved in vaccine research, and many labs with which we have been in contact have highlighted their need for more processing power,” Beni Hakak, CEO of LiquidApps, said over Telegram.

Homemade hand sanitizer    The rush to stock up ahead of a potential quarantine has emptied groceries and pharmacies of hand sanitizers. But, thankfully, you can make your own.      A Popular Science article breaks down the steps in a how-to guide:      Taking one cup of 91 percent isopropyl alcohol, half a cup of aloe vera gel and 15 drops of tea tree oil and stirring can yield a pretty effective hand sanitizer solution, according to the blog.      The World Health Organization recommends a similarly easy solution, though it yields a massive quantity. The agency writes, in a 10-litre (2.6 gallon) glass or plastic bottle mix 8333 ml of 96 percent ethanol, 417 ml of hydrogen peroxide, and 145 ml glycerol.      At least one Crypto Twitter fixture has tried the solution, and is now offering bottles to anyone in need.    DIY 'ventilator-ish' devices    There aren’t enough ventilators to cope with the coronavirus, reports the New York Times. In this time of critical shortage, a number of do-it-yourself solutions have sprung up to meet demand.      One, an open-source project hosted on GitHub, provides instructions for a “low-cost open-source ventilator-ish device.”      “This rudimentary design could provide a target breathing rate, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). It cannot guarantee a specific tidal volume, and doesn't regulate specific fractional oxygen (FiO2),” the project leads, write (not wholly reassuringly).      Similarly, a group MIT students built a “disaster zone” ventilator for $100 in spare parts.      While CoinDesk cannot in good faith recommend this as a solution, this could be an interesting project for the technically-inclined to while away the idle quarantine hours.      Meanwhile, Panvent, a blogspot website, has a detailed list of personal protective equipment (PPE) that people can use to prevent the spread of disease – ranging from the CDC recommended n95 mask to a full-faced positive air pressure respirator (PAPR) – alongside their own workaround solutions.    Crypto consultations  Grant Gulovsen of Gulovsen Law Office and Rafael Yakobi of The Crypto Lawyers have teamed up to offer free 20-minute legal consultationshttps://gulovsen.io/gulovsen-law-office-teams-up-with-the-crypto-lawyers-to-offer-free-crypto-legal-consultations-via-online-video/ to members of the crypto community. The sessions will be conducted via online video conference.    “Rafael Yakobi and I understand there’s a lot of friction and distrust of lawyers in the crypto community and thought this might be a way to break through some of that. Given the social distancing that everyone is being forced to perform as a result of the current health crisis, having these consultations online obviously made the most sense,” Gulovsen said in an email.      Gulovsen said he and Yakobi work almost exclusively with individuals and startups innovating in the crypto and blockchain space, helping them with regulatory compliance as well as the ins and outs of corporate law.      “It remains to be seen exactly how COVID will impact our client base, although I expect it will have the same sort of impact as it does on anyone trying to launch a startup. We are both adapting and responding to different questions that come up, especially as it relates to more traditional practice areas like employment law,” he said.    Banding together    The Covid-19 pandemic is disrupting all industries, including the arts. Band tours are being canceled as concert halls are boarded up.      “With such a major revenue stream drying up almost entirely, finding ways to continue supporting artists in the coming months is now an urgent priority for anyone who cares about music and the artists who create it,” Ethan Diamond, co-founder and CEO of Bandcamp, said in a blog.      To help ensure struggling or upstart musicians are able to pay rent, Bandcamp will waive its take of donations and payments made to artists this Friday, Mar. 20. Part of the Web 2.0 revolution, Bandcamp was at the forefront of placing pressure on the once-overpowered arbiters of musical judgment.      “[I]f you’re lucky enough to be in a position to spare some funds, please consider sharing your good fortune by buying music and merchandise directly from artists.”    Sam Altman steps in    Sam Altman, former president of Y Combinator and CEO of OpenAI, is looking to fund startups and projects helping with Covid-19.      “[I]t’s basically the one thing I know how to do that can help,” Altman wrote on his blog.      This open call to founders is meant to spur work on ventilator production, therapeutic solutions for the disease, and a new vaccine – “i.e., not doing what the big pharma companies are already doing,” he said.      Altman is renowned in the VC circuit for striking early investments in Airbnb, Stripe, Reddit, and the pepper’s staple Soylent.    CoCo Broadcasting Briefs    CoCo Briefs is a decentralized approach to broadcasting, aiming “to empower anyone with an audience to spread positive, helpful, truth-based information – through blogs, videos, social media, and email blasts,” writes John Hargrave, the author of Blockchain for Everyone and CEO of Media Shower, in a company blog.      CoCo provides a template to send actionable and inspiring posts into the ether of the internet, to to battle against the fear and misinformation that coronavirus raises. ""The final score will be Humans 20, COVID-19,"" Hargrave said.      “We all have an audience, and we all have a voice. Your voice is stronger than you think,” he said.    Perspective: Matthew Graham, CEO, Sino Global Capital    ""The COVID-19 quarantine has been the most surreal experience of my entire life. Here in China where I live and work this has been my lived experience for several months now. When the virus first exploded in January, I made the decision to stay in China for family and business reasons. From the extraordinary precautions being taken, it was immediately evident this was an extreme situation. I was staying at a fully booked hotel with a capacity of two hundred rooms. Very quickly the hotel emptied out until only three or four guests remained. Soon the hotel was ordered to close, and I made the decision to self-quarantine.      Like many, if not most in China, I very rapidly realized that this was a time for extreme steps. I ordered a large quantity of masks for family, friends, and clients, paid a neighborhood kid to deliver food, and closed the door.    Only in the last few days has China really started to venture back outside.    Only in the last few days has China really started to venture back outside. The country feels like it’s coming back to life step by step, but yet, it’s not quite recognizable. There are thousands of people on the streets, and every single one wears a face mask. Checkpoints for temperature checks are everywhere, and we scan QR codes for big data contact tracing.      Three days ago I went outside. The first time in six weeks.      I feel safe. Safe, but worried for my friends and family back home.""    Following the social buzz    People have been quick to notice how social media has become the de facto source of information since the outbreak of COVID-19. For weeks, the media and governments alike tried to downplay the potential impacts of the virus, to disastrous effect.      That’s why Will Bleakley spun up the Covid-19 Live Display Hub, a real-time stream of COVID-19-related posts on various social platforms. The hub aggregates regional and country-specific content, so readers can stay up-to-date on what’s happening around them.    For weeks, the media and governments alike tried to downplay the potential impacts of the virus, to disastrous effect.    To decentralize the news gathering process, the Covid-19 Live Display Hub sources information from local media organizations, regional World Health Organization Pages, government agencies, politicians, and other public accounts.    Voting dilemma    While the official line is to “Stay the F Home,” Drew Hinkes, a crypto attorney with Carlton Fields, ventured outside yesterday to cast a ballot.      “Based on what we're hearing from scientists and specialists, it is smart to take precautions,” Hinkes said in an email. But still, there are some forms of public engagement that take precedence over public health, namely, the health of our democracy.      “I do feel strongly that as Americans, we should vote while it's still safe to do so,” he said.    Sky Guo    Sky Guo, the founder and CEO of the smart contract platform Cypherium has some thoughts to share about the possibility of a market recovery, following the Covid scare.    The virus has been contained in China, and is now under control in Korea. As long as quarantines and other measurements are adopted in a timely manner, we shouldn’t be afraid of the virus. The crypto markets, like our immune systems, can self-heal and gain strength for future crises.  People in our community are not very worried about the crisis. They’ve been discussing the markets in a very calm and analytical way. People are hoping for a recovery, and for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high after the halving this year.  DIY Home-Schooling Guide    Jenny Balliet, founder and CEO Lula & Co., a consultancy that advises on blockchain applications among other fields, is curating an ongoing teaching guide for stressed-out parents who’ve never, until the past week’s wave of shutdowns, had to think of home-schooling their kids.      She describes herself as a “diehard Vygotskian” – a reference to the cognitive development theories of Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky, who advocated social learning as a predecessor for cognitive development.    Applying those ideas, Balliet came up with this handbookhttps://medium.com/series/education-disrupted-coaching-for-students-6b15d772414b. The first updates to the guide, she says, will be about oil markets, bitcoin resources, gaming for a cure and writing meta-cognition.  Blockseer Founder’s Nationwide Test Data Site    Test, test, test and test some more. That’s the mantra from pretty much every expert about how communities can get ahead of the coronavirus pandemic and figure out how best to respond and assign scarce resources.      But none of that is good for much if the data on the pandemic is not captured, aggregated and delivered in a reliable way for health professionals, political leaders and ordinary folk to make sense of. This is why an initiative by Danny Yang, founder of block explorer Blockseer, is potentially so important.      The site repeatedly scrapes data from all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and aggregates them in real-time, creating easy-to-follow charts. It may well be the most up-to-date, most reliable source of official data available. Check it out here: coronavirusapi.com.    Reflections on an Eerily Quiet NYC    Arnold Waldstein is a veteran marketing and business strategist with a passion for environmental solutions and wine. But he’s best known in the crypto community for his interests in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and in pioneering an NFT fundraising model with the “Honu” turtle-cat CryptoKitty, which raised $140,000 for ocean conservation.      Today he dedicated his blog to reflecting on what life in the busiest city in the world has become like in just a few short days.      In doing so, he demonstrated the power of the written word and of storytelling to reach across the void and connect with others – as vital a service as any in this uncertain period of radical social distancing.    Meltem Demirors Shares Her Plan    “Here’s what’s going on,” began the level-headed Meltem Demirors, founder of crypto investment firm CoinShares.      “This is my third crypto bear market and my second financial crisis, and our exec team has seen several macro market cycles and three global re-pricing events, so we are staying calm, analyzing the market, and building for opportunities we believe will we are well-suited to capitalize on in the weeks and months that follow,” she said.      Demirors is focused on communicating and connecting with her team, clients, partners and portfolio companies in this time of uncertainty. In her own words:      1. We’re actively reviewing all of our counter-party exposure, risk exposure, and business continuity plans, and proactively communicating internally and externally. Crypto community has been resilient, our counterparties are doing a great job!      2. Calling all of our portfolio execs on the venture investing side, sharing what we’re hearing, and making sure they’re feeling supported. Helping them secure 12 – 18 months of runway if needed:      3. Publishing fact-based research.      4. Checking in and texting, calling, emailing, and letting people know I’m thinking of them. I’m setting up hangouts to chat, share ideas, and keep the community intact during these difficult times, and joining other people’s webinars and conference calls to hear what they’re thinking about. Also – lots of VR hangouts in bitcoin!      5. Lastly, memes and humor. A little bit of laughter never hurt anyone!    CryptoMondays Goes Virtual Reality    With help from Bits and Tokens, a blockchain media company, and featuring a fireside chat with CoinDesk reporter William Foxley, CryptoMondays was able to avoid the perils of meatspace and convene digitally.      Lou Kerner, the meetup's organizer said it “was pretty cool, until the trolls came.”    Care Chokepoints    Timothy Mackey, an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego, thinks that blockchain can help solve some of the current “choke points” affecting coronavirus patient care.      Forbes reports the professor of health studies has added a blockchain solutions module to his Global Health Policy undergraduate course, which has since gone remote. Mackey believes blockchain is an important tool in helping to spread accurate information about infectious diseases, as well as maintaining healthcare supply chains.      “This is likely just the beginning of a norm of the globalization of infectious disease outbreaks,” Mackey told Forbes. “And we can’t effectively respond without leveraging technology to enable better international cooperation.”      David Shrier    The blockchain author and futurist writes:    Bunkered in Charlestown, MA, overlooking a now-very-quiet Logan Airport, anxiously awaiting my delivering of TP from Amazon which allegedly will be within days not weeks. Heavily working the phones and chat groups to similarly isolated colleagues, some of whom are organizing data analytics syndicates to address COVID-19 related global health data sharing (leveraging work I did for the UN on training crisis response teams from UNOCHA and UNHCR on the use of big data during large-scale humanitarian crises).  Insurance Chain    An insurance provider in China used a blockchain-based settlement system to offer quick, one-time payments to victims of the coronavirus.      Xiang Hu Bao, an online mutual aid platform, reportedly began paying out (a maximum of) 100,000 yuan ($14,320) claims to some of its 104 million health plan participants.      Ant Financial, the platform’s parent company, has funded the payments.      “Xiang Hu Bao has been able to process claims and make payouts to participants quicker, due to the decentralised, trust-free nature of blockchain technology,” an Ant Financial spokesman told the South China Morning Post.    Headspace    Headspace, a meditation app startup, announced it will offer free subscriptions for healthcare professionals working in public settings.      At a $70 value, the subscriptions will run until the end of 2020, according to PitchBook, a financial data provider.      The healthcare startup has reportedly seen a doubling of inbound requests from members since Friday, as well as a 100 percent increase in corporate clients looking for ways to improve employee’s mental wellbeing, according to PitchBook.    Vinay Gupta, CEO of Mattereum    The CEO of the Ethereum-based startup writes:    Some people take whatever solution they have knowledge of, be it cryptocash or cleaning products, and try to wedge it in to the crisis. We are against this. It’s important to be clear and realistic about the suitability and capability of one’s technology. That said, we are looking at the situation around the rapid, decentralized mass production of ventilator systems and other medical equipment, and wondering about things like certification of schematics, ""as manufactured"" parts lists, maintenance records, safety recalls and so on. Mattereum's core operating principles about product authentication work equally well for fine art as for engineering products, but this is a sobering scenario, and we are being responsible as we look at scenarios.  3D Printing at FabLab    Massimo Temporelli, founder of The FabLab in Milan, used a 3D printer to build a needed component for a breathing apparatus.      According to industry publication 3Dprintingmedia.network, the machine was used to intubate 10 patients over the weekend, possibly saving their lives.      “As the virus inevitably continues to spread worldwide and breaks supply chains, 3D printers – through people’s ingenuity and design abilities – can definitely lend a helping hand. Or valve, or protective gear, or masks, or anything you will need and can’t get from your usual supplier,” David Sher reports.    Mir Liponi, Milan    The bitcoin meetup organizer and entrepreneur writes:    During the first days was almost like normal life during the summer, when many shops and businesses are closed and few people around. Now, it's different because we basically can't move from home. The city is like a ghost town. It's becoming difficult to get food and I'm starting to see the negatives of the situation. I'm kinda reclusive, but this is very extreme... Because it's not only you, but everyone else who is living like this. Italians are great in keeping company and they are discovering digital ways to connect to each other or just singing from the balconies... So you don't feel so alone after all. We have to find a new routine, a new way to feel good and connect with the others.  Malaysia dispatch    Reuben Yap, project steward at Zcoin, lives in Malaysia, which has recorded a total of 553 COVID-19 cases so far. He said the country is going into lockdown.      His wife works on the frontlines at the Sarawak General Hospital.      “She works in anesthesia and intensive care,” Yap said. “I have an elderly father as well who lives in a house down the road from me and my wife has her own family as well.”      “The impacts are quite severe for my wife and I. This week she's undergoing hazmat suit training and if she's required to intubate or be exposed to the patient, she'll have to be quarantined in the hospital.”      Today, Malaysia banned all foreign travelers from entering the country. “Malaysians can return and self-quarantine. They cannot fly out,” Yap said.      “Essential shops are kept open but private offices, religious places, all societies and everything are closed. There are mad rushes to stock up now but luckily I stocked up earlier.”    Open-Source Hacks    Bruce Fenton: Why ventilators are so important to most vulnerable, yet are in short supply.      And, what you can do about it.    Ryan Zurrer 'Helping to Prevent DeFi From Defaulting'    Amid this period of severe market fluctuations, investor Ryan Zurrer is helping to prevent ""DeFi"" from defaulting. Zurrer, founder of Dialectic, a Swiss-based crypto-asset firm and former chief commercial officer at the Web3 Foundation, has taken on ""very conservative"" collateralized debt positions (CDPs) to keep MakerDAO functioning.      MakerDAO nearly collapsed last week after the Ethereum blockchain failed to keep up with investor demand. To this end, Zurrer has also spun up a Keeper bot in anticipation of the potential auction – which could draw in a huge wave of investors, again – later this week.      ""For me, MakerDAO is DeFi and one of the most compelling projects on Ethereum, so I will not let it capitulate to a full-on Black Swan event without doing everything in my power to protect it,"" Zurrer said.    17-Year-Old Tracks Instances of Coronavirus    Avi Schiffmann, a high school junior from Mercer Island, just outside Seattle, launched a website to track instances of coronavirus in late December. It has since become a vital resource for researchers and the public working to stay safe in questionable times.      Using the most recent figures from the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control, Schiffmann’s site presents the most up-to-date local, national and global information in an easy to read format. This includes information on the amount of confirmed and recovered cases, and deaths, as well as a Wiki and newsletter to provide basic facts about the virus.      The site has been visited by millions of people.      “The main goal of it was to provide just an easy way to see the straight facts and the data, you know, without having to make a website that was biased or, you know, full of ads or anything like that,” Schiffmann told Democracy Now!    Desperate Times  Crypto Fundraiser    The Giving Block, a crypto charity initiative, is partnering with nonprofit charities to launch a crypto fundraiser this week.      “Government responses are failing. Nonprofits, companies and individuals need to step up,” Giving Block co-founder Alex Wilson said in an email. “Crypto and tech saw it coming first so we're hoping this community will be particularly supportive.”      All donations go directly to wallets controlled by the nonprofit, and clients have the option of automatically converting their crypto to fiat. Recently, The Giving Block teamed up with Gemini for an International Women's Day campaign that raised $15,000 (in crypto) in 24 hours.      Gitcoin will match up to $100,000 in donations made in ETH or DAI during the campaign, and Brave will provide free advertisements. More details, including its nonprofit partners, are forthcoming tomorrow.    Xenia von Wedel, COO of Transform Group    The COO of the crypto PR firm writes:    Apart from the financial worries that our economy if going to tank, I actually enjoy the luxury of extra time to do yoga, and I signed up for afternoon CNA training. That way I will be able to volunteer at the local hospital in case there is a need for extra hands. Don't get me wrong, doing PR for blockchain companies is a great job, but it might be nice to have a positive impact on some people's lives for a change... However, I hope in a couple of months life will be back to normal.  Helping People Volunteer    New York Cares is hosting digital orientation sessions so volunteers will be ready to participate in their communities once it’s safe again to leave the house.      “Whenever the coronavirus is in our rearview mirror, hopefully, we know that there’s going to be a huge amount of service that we’re going to try to grow and meet,” Gary Bagley, president of the volunteer coordinating agency, told The City.    Distributed Work to Build 3D Models of COVID-19    Folding@Home uses computer simulations to build models of virus proteins, which may assist in the hunt for a vaccine. They could use your help.      Using distributed work from computers around the world, volunteers can contribute their excess CPU or GPU space to help run these modeling experiments.      “These calculations are enormous and every little bit helps! Each simulation you run is like buying a lottery ticket. The more tickets we buy, the better our chances of hitting the jackpot,” the Folding@Home team writes.      To help, you can download the Folding@Home software package, or make a donation to the team.

It also announced $700 billion of direct capital injection through the purchase of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed debt.      The question is whether this action can actually calm markets.

42404218,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhaIF,1584385117,Bitcoin Volume Gains Traction After 24-Hour Roller-Coaster Ride,"Bitcoin prices have been on a roller-coaster ride since Sunday afternoon after the Federal Reserve slashed rates a full percentage point to the vicinity of 0 percent and promised to pump $700 billion into the U.S. economy. After initially rising on the news and then falling, the cryptocurrency's buying volumes have picked up.       It's been an active 24 hours.      The central bank's drastic measures, taken to offset possible effects of the coronavirus on the U.S. and global economy, included its fourth trip to the quantitative easing (QE) well. However, this action of buying Treasuries and mortgage debt spooked an already nervous stock market, prompting major sell-offs in equity markets all over the world.      Trading in futures contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were briefly halted Sunday evening when their decline triggered circuit breakers. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index also had more sellers than buyers.       Meanwhile, bitcoin’s (BTC) reaction showed its traders didn’t know how to take the news. The cryptocurrency initially soared about 8 percent in the hour after Sunday’s emergency meeting and announcement. Then the world’s leading cryptocurrency continued higher, trading as high as $5,990 that night on exchanges including Coinbase. Yet, the rally was short. By Monday morning, bitcoin came close to sinking below $4,500 on some exchanges.      Since bitcoin’s drop, buying volumes have picked up, and it changed hands around $5,069 as of 18:00 UTC (2 p.m. ET), down 4 percent in the past 24 hours.             The S&P 500 was also down as of 18:00 UTC, off by 9 percent after automatic trading curbs went into effect. It’s a stark change from the rally that took place in the last hour of trading before the U.S. markets’ close on March 13 when President Trump declared a state of emergency on the coronavirus.      For a brief period, gold lost its shine as traders hit the sell button on the yellow metal at around 10:00 UTC on Monday, but bullion recovered just as bitcoin was selling off.      “Gold is finding footing today so I’m turning pretty bullish short term,” said Jack Tan of Kronos Research, a Taipei, Taiwan-based trading firm.      After hovering in the $4,600 to $5,900 range for much of the March 14 weekend prior to the Fed news, traders are now looking at that $5,000 area again as a place to buy bitcoin      “Seems like bitcoin is finding support around the $5,000 level. I have purchased around these levels,” added Tan.      A $5,000 price level for bitcoin brings with it some doubt for cryptocurrency miners. That’s because it creates greater uncertainty about mining farms’ profitability. However, Denis Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant, thinks the mining industry, a linchpin in securing the Bitcoin network, remains strong.      “While (uncertainty) may be true for smaller farms, the mining ecosystem as a whole remains strong and as secure as ever. More so, apart from anecdotal evidence, there are yet to be any concrete signs of a slump in the hashrate dedicated to mining bitcoin,” Vinokourov noted.

42404206,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdha9O,1584381600,"In Fight Against Coronavirus, Governments Face Trade-Offs on Privacy","Thousands of people in the United States have tested positive for COVID-19, and the death toll around the world has surpassed 6,000. Italy is under lockdown and in New York City the government is demanding businesses including bars, restaurants and movie theaters be closed in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.      After draconian measures were implemented in China to halt the rapid infection rate of the virus, including movement restrictions, large scale surveillance and forced isolation, it seems such measures are working, with new cases in China declining. Those same measures are unlikely to be adopted in the U.S., but the government and employers across the nation will have to navigate complex questions regarding privacy and public health in the coming months.      “It is telling that at this point, public health experts are not calling for any of these measures; they have been clear that the tactics that will be most useful are social distancing and good hygiene like careful hand-washing and disinfecting,” says Rachel Levinson-Waldman, Senior Counsel of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, at NYU School of Law.      See also: Mass Surveillance Threatens Personal Privacy Amid Coronavirus      “China has implemented surveillance tools at odds with core American values like freedom to speak, to travel and to assemble. Coronavirus – while undeniably a public health emergency – should not become an excuse to institute tools that would undermine those values.”      The implications of China’s actions are far-reaching when it comes to further compromising their citizen’s privacy, and could well be left in place even after the coronavirus is under control, as CoinDesk wrote about last week.      Kathryn Waldron, a cybersecurity fellow at the R Street Institute, a think tank that promotes free markets and limited government, is skeptical we’ll see the rollout of surveillance technology in the U.S. on the same scale as China. First, the U.S. doesn’t have the scale of facial recognition infrastructure already in place to conduct mass surveillance that China does. Second, Americans are less likely to allow wide-scale government surveillance on the scale of China.    This is not a time for employers to opportunistically collect additional information about their employees or to introduce employee surveillance measures.    “Government surveillance isn’t a new phenomenon to Chinese citizens,” says Waldron. “China’s Social Credit Score system already used facial recognition technology and nearly omnipresent surveillance to manage people’s daily lives and individuals with insufficient scores have already been denied the ability to travel on occasion, long before COVID-19 was a threat. Rolling out additional surveillance measures now isn’t radically new behavior.”    The cost of public health    There is a tension between the needs of the public in staying safe and the erosion of privacy that might necessitate, and it’s unclear what path the government might chart forward in this regard.      Levinson-Waldman says the calls right now are for people to self-isolate, and she hasn’t heard suggestions that technologies like those being used in China are going to be introduced here.      But she raises the lockdown of Boston in the search for the perpetrators of the Boston marathon bombing as something that might offer insights into the current situation. She says that may have been an understandable decision in the immediate aftermath of a major emergency, but it was also arguably a significant violation of civil liberties. There were other steps, such as not closing all public transit in the city or locking the city down, that could have been taken.      “It’s not hard to imagine that there could be some kind of governmental overreaction to this crisis, whether we’re talking about privacy or other civil liberties,” Levinson-Waldman says.      See also: Erik Voorhees: Within Five Years There Will Be a Major Financial Meltdown and Crypto Will Be Ready      The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil liberties nonprofit, has also sounded the alarm about protecting civil rights during a public health crisis. A recent statement from the organization says that “many government agencies are collecting and analyzing personal information about large numbers of identifiable people, including their health, travel, and personal relationships.” Such measures, while justified during a crisis, should not become permanent fixtures of society, the EFF says. It suggests principles like an expiration date for any data collected; that any collection be based on science, not bias; and due process be adhered to when it comes to taking action on available data.      “If the government seeks to limit a person’s rights based on this 'big data' surveillance (for example, to quarantine them based on the system’s conclusions about their relationships or travel), then the person must have the opportunity to timely and fairly challenge these conclusions and limits,” reads the statement.    The workplace (from home)    It’s not just the government that is having to navigate these complex questions. It’s employers, too, as questions about exposure and infection are forcing employers to determine what personal information they need to, or can, collect about employees to protect their workforce.      Under regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration plus laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), HIPAA, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), among others, employers must respect staff privacy and other rights. With coronavirus, that would preclude administering any kind of health testing or directly inquiring about an employee’s health condition or medical diagnosis, says Elizabeth M. Renieris, a lawyer and a fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.      “One way to balance these competing demands is to employ general measures that don’t require invasive questioning or interference with individual employees,” she says. They should not be discussing any individual employee’s health condition or personal circumstances with other employees or third parties, except under limited circumstances where they might encourage the impacted employee to seek assistance from medical providers or public health authorities.      “This is not a time for employers to opportunistically collect additional information about their employees or to introduce employee surveillance measures,” says Renieris. “Employees do not surrender all of their privacy rights in a crisis.”",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | ASIA | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/16/in-fight-against-coronavirus-governments-face-trade-offs-on-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2fdbdc0ea78bf410347cfd04d6fad2a6f88cd3e1-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move seemingly coincides with the bitcoin derivatives provider’s long-awaited focus on consumer-facing services and the announcement earlier today of a whopping $300 million funding round. Bakkt's parent firm, Intercontinental Exchange, first revealed Starbucks was looking at retail applications for crypto payments in August 2018.      However, Starbucks says the Bakkt Cash option is only in limited beta for now.      “We are currently conducting a limited test for our customers, using the Bakkt payment method,” a Starbucks spokesperson told CoinDesk. “Customers can see Bakkt as an option but the test is only available at this time.”      In a statement, Starbucks confirmed it remains a ""strategic launch partner"" for Bakkt's dollar-denominated digital wallet.      ""We anticipate that a range of cryptocurrencies will gain traction with customers and, through our work with Bakkt, we will be uniquely positioned to constantly consider and offer customers new and unique ways to pay seamlessly, at Starbucks,"" the coffee chain said.      Bakkt President Adam White announced the integration on Twitter:      The company’s Monday blog post describes plans to put loyalty points and bitcoin in the same conversation. Bakkt has discussed offering loyalty point programs and crypto payments through a single app since at least February, when it first moved to acquire loyalty solutions provider Bridge2.      Later, Bakkt CEO Mike Blandina said the firm plans to launch the wallet ""later this summer.""      ""The ability to trade different digital assets is part of that but it will be a merchant-by-merchant launch,"" he told CoinDesk. ""You may be able to trade certain loyalty points but not others.""      “At Bakkt, we take a broad view of digital assets,” the company wrote. “Whether it’s miles from your favorite airline, loyalty points from the local grocery store, or bitcoin you’ve purchased, the Bakkt app enables you to aggregate all of these assets into a single digital wallet.”      In response to the growing threat of coronavirus in the U.S., Starbucks is temporarily moving to a takeout-only model, CNBC reported Sunday.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/16/bakkt-touts-new-payment-integration-with-starbucks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c11875a0dda5eeab1902f68e7f5f2091c9e194b-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404215,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhaGH,1584376210,Why Bitcoin's Safe-Haven Narrative Has Flown Out the Window,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s director of research. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.      The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.      Listen. That whooshing sound you hear is not just the bitcoin (BTC) price. It’s also the sound of the safe-haven narrative flying out the window, probably for ever.      March 12 was not bitcoin’s worst 24-hour price crash ever. That honor belongs to April 11, 2013, when bitcoin fell by almost 50 percent.      Comparing the two crashes helps to understand what happened this week. It also helps to form a picture of what this sector could look like going forward.      For context, in April 2013 Ethereum had not yet launched, Mt. Gox was the largest bitcoin exchange and the Harlem Shake meme dominated the internet. The previous month, the price ranged between $34 and $94, and the average transaction (according to Coin Metrics) was under $800.      Chinese demand powered the retail-driven market. Professional custody services were just warming up (BitGo, one of the first, was formed in 2013). Coinbase was less than a year old. BitMEX had not yet created the perpetual swap. Heck, CoinDesk didn’t even exist then (we started publishing the following month).      In 2013, bitcoin was the “asset of the future,” a decentralized representation of value, a protest against powerlessness and a way for savers to reduce their vulnerability to central bank action. Market participants believed in the story. By some accounts, the price started to rise along with international attention on the Cyprus banking crisis, in which a haircut was applied to all deposits over €100,000 at the two largest banks.      If you were a 2013 bitcoin investor and you time-travelled to now, you would not recognize the scene. Chinese demand has dissipated. Mt. Gox is a bitter memory. A lively derivatives market drives volume. Big, incumbent financial institutions have set up digital asset desks. Really, you’d pinch yourself.      You might also be a bit alarmed. You’d love the legitimacy and the platform sophistication, and you’d get genuinely excited about all the smart people who have left their finance jobs to work in crypto. You’d almost certainly be stunned the sector has evolved so quickly. And you’d be thrilled the institutions have taken an interest. Finally, professional traders have grasped the possibilities.      But you’d also wonder where the ideology went, where was the focus on empowerment rather than profits.      Crypto markets went and grew up. They substituted their hoodie for a button-down and put on some big-boy shoes. They made new friends, became more responsible and entered a new world of risk.    A tale of two crashes    To get a feel for how that risk has changed the sector, let’s look at the market behavior of the two crashes.      Back then most market participants were long. The absence of a liquid derivatives market made shorting relatively cumbersome and expensive. Trading was dominated by those who had taken the time to understand bitcoin, and they acted according to whether they thought it was over- or under-valued. The April 11 crash was triggered by profit taking – the price had more than tripled in the previous two weeks. It was a narrative-driven slump.      What’s more, it was isolated. That same week, the S&P 500 was largely flat, as was gold. It was entirely a bitcoin story.      Today the market is dominated by professional trading desks. They know about markets. While many are probably attracted to the idea of a fiat alternative, their jobs are about playing numbers. For them, it’s not about bitcoin, it’s about volatility.      Last week’s crash was a liquidity event, triggered by margin calls in crypto and other assets, and by a massive investor panic. This crash was about raising cash and covering liquidity. It had nothing to do with bitcoin itself.      Nor was it isolated – the S&P 500 suffered its worst 24-hour slump in history. Bitcoin’s story was not part of the activity this week. Bitcoin was just another financial asset getting trampled as investors headed for the exit.      That is why its safe haven narrative has died.      And that’s a good thing. Let’s look at why.      First, bitcoin was never a safe haven. Even before this recent crash it was just too volatile, too young and too untested for that role. In spite of the lack of logic, the narrative endured because so many wanted it to be true.      Now that we can put that legend to rest – an asset that can fall by over 40 percent intraday is unlikely toeverbe taken seriously as a safe haven – more realistic expectations should emerge. This will support credibility amongst the investment community and perhaps give bitcoin a more justifiable role in portfolio management.      Also, this week has revealed there is no such thing as a safe haven. Gold and T-bills, the assets the market traditionally turns to in times of turmoil, also fell, largely due to liquidity squeezes. Investors were scrambling to raise cash this week – but even that safe-haven asset could come under strain as the global economy tips into recession and geopolitics adds tensions to monetary policy as well as faith in sovereign credit.      Yet, portfolios need diversification – market assumptions may have been turned upside down and trust in correlations may take some time to recover, but the underlying math hasn’t changed. Even with investment principles in turmoil, the demand for alternative assets will not go away, and professional investors are already taking stock, adjusting objectives and rebalancing.    New role for bitcoin?    In a world worried about income, assets like bitcoin and gold that don’t depend on cash flows for their valuation are likely to occupy an increasingly important role in investment allocations as “alternative assets.”      The greater the range of alternative assets, the better for investors, especially in troubling times like these. Analysts and fund managers will be looking for opportunities to offset the upcoming shift in market fundamentals – many are likely to take a closer look at bitcoin, which does not depend on macroeconomic metrics.      In a market where relationships are broken and assumptions are smashed, an alternative asset – vulnerable as it may be to money flows – does start to take on an appealing narrative of its own, more innovative and more credible than that of the safe haven.      With this, the integration into traditional finance that we wanted for bitcoin can do so much more than make it vulnerable to the ravages of global sentiment. It can also finally bring it the opportunity it deserves.

The OCC announced Brooks' appointment Monday, saying U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin designated Brooks as the new deputy effective April 1, 2020. Brooks, a former Fannie Mae executive vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary, has served as chief legal officer at Coinbase since September 2018.      Mnuchin said in a statement he looks forward to working with Brooks to ensure ""the stability of our financial system.""      The OCC is responsible for for supervising and regulating national banks and financial institutions within the U.S. Established in 1863, the independent entity ensures banks are meeting capital and risk requirements, according to Investopedia.      Current Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting, who was nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump and sworn in in 2017, said in a statement that Brooks ""brings an extensive career of legal, banking and financial innovation expertise to the agency.""      ""He is a visionary thinker with a passion for service and a deep understanding of how the financial services industry supports our nation's prosperity. We are fortunate to attract such an experienced and talented individual to join our federal agency,"" Otting said.      Indeed, Brooks has been a vocal proponent of developing a private digital currency for the U.S., writing in Fortune Magazine last year that private corporations are best suited to building a digital dollar.      He envisioned a system where the public sector would set monetary policy, but the actual technology would be built by the private space.

42404195,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdha1W,1584367226,"Bank of Russia Says New Digital Assets Bill Will Outlaw Crypto Trading, Issuance","A new version of Russia’s delayed bill on digital assets will include a ban on issuing and selling cryptocurrencies, according to the country’s central bank.      Bank of Russia (BoR) remains in favor of what are being called digital financial assets, and even tested a pilot tokenization project in its regulatory sandbox last December. In an interview with the Russian news agency Interfax, however, its head of legal office Alexey Guznov said the institution did not believe cryptocurrency issuance and trading should be legal in the country.      “We believe there are big risks of legalizing the operations with the cryptocurrencies, from the standpoint of financial stability, money laundering prevention and consumer protection,” Guznov said.      The bank took an active part in discussing the digital asset legislation, which has been waiting to be heard in Russia’s parliament since last spring. So far, it describes the rules for issuing security tokens in Russia, without mentioning cryptocurrency at all.      The central bank contributed to a second draft of the bill in the fall of 2019, clarifying the requirements for the issuers of such tokens, Guznov said. In particular, the issuer should report capital of no less than $660,000 (5 million Russian rubles) and be able to provide the access to the ledger to law enforcement if needed.      However, BoR is still reluctant to let tokens that are not securities, like bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) , gain a legal standing in Russia.      “Now we’ve approached consensus with other government bodies and market players that participate in the discussion. That consensus might be that nobody is going to ban owning cryptocurrencies,” Guznov said, adding that crypto “in the end, is not drugs or arms.”      But “legalization of issuance and, which is even more important, circulation of cryptocurrencies pose an unjustified risk, which is why the [future] law prohibits issuing and organizing the market for cryptocurrencies, and also introduces the punishment for violating the ban,” according to Guznov.      People will not be punished for owning crypto “if they made their deal in a jurisdiction that does not prohibit that,” he explained, but institutions that make crypto trading and usage possible would be outlawed under the bill.      The bill might finally get passed during this spring session of the parliament, Guznov also indicated.      Bank of Russia's leadership has been consistently skeptical about cryptocurrencies for the past couple of years. In October 2017, the regulator's chairwoman, Elvira Nabiullina, said cryptocurrencies, just like private money, should not be legal in Russia. Last autimn, she also said Russia does not need its own national digital currency.      Bank of Russia reported in December it was running the first pilot tokenization project by mining and smelting company Nornickel, which is planning to tokenize batches of palladium, cobalt and copper and sell metal-backed stablecoins. The company is now testing its marketplace for the tokens, registered in Switzerland.

The company plans to launch the app by the summer, Blandina said.      “Digital assets have been around for decades, and we all have way more value there than we realize.

42404211,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhaEJ,1584365157,"Extreme Social Distancing: Self-Quarantine Diary, Day 1","Michael J. Casey is CoinDesk’s chief content officer. The views expressed here are his own. This article is the first in an occasional series.      I made a difficult decision Sunday.      Having watched with jaw-dropping amazement the speed with which coronavirus cases have exploded in Italy, Spain, Seattle and, now, in my home state of New York, I rapidly realized my family and I need to practice a much more extreme version of social distancing.      For reasons I’ll get into below, I will, for the feasible future, remain in my bedroom, while my wife and children occupy the rest of the house. All of us will have only bare minimum contact with each other and with the outside world.      I plan to write a blog about this. Not so much a diary of my experiences, but a reflection on what all this might mean for humanity. I'll be publishing daily on Medium and a select few relevant posts will run on CoinDesk.      What do I have to offer? I’m definitely not an epidemiologist, a sociologist, an economist, a technologist or a political scientist. But I’m lucky enough to be able to write. And I have access to media distribution channels such as CoinDesk. Information is a vital resource right now. I feel a responsibility to take advantage of the privileged access I have. And I do believe my story can help.      Also, I’ve spent my life wondering about big global phenomena and what happens to them at the intersection of economics, information and technology-aided interconnectivity. My five books are all very different, but they coalesce around a core theme at the heart of these issues: what it means to be human in an age of globalized, hyper-connectedness.      I hope to frame those issues around the coronavirus crisis and our response to it, which is of course intricately tied to how we’ve built such a globalized, interconnected society. I want to explore answers to some of the pressing questions that arise from that so that we might together make sense of all this.      How did we get in this mess? How do we get out of it? And what will the future, post-coronavirus world look like?      My cloudy lungs    For now, though, I’m just going to answer the most immediate question: Why did I take this extreme measure? And why am I, not my family, the one all alone? After all, I am not at all sick.      The short answer is that I’m at a higher risk than others in their early fifties. I have a condition called sarcoidosis, an auto-immune disease that mostly manifests in the lungs, as it did in my case. All evidence suggests I’m in full remission and have been for decades. It has never bothered me. In fact, I only learned that I had previously contracted sarcoid – most likely sometime in the late 1990s – because of a mandatory chest X-ray for immigration purposes in 2002, which revealed a clouding effect in my lungs, the tell-tale signs of past scarring. (About 90 percent of sarcoid patients have a similarly benign experience, but for a minority, it can be much more debilitating and for a small few, fatal.)      The problem for me during the coronavirus pandemic is twofold. For one, sarcoid left my lung function modestly impaired, which means any constraint on my breathing could be more extreme. Secondly, having just learned the coronavirus, in the most chronic cases, turns the body’s auto-immune system against it, there’s a possibility catching it might reignite the same response. This time, the consequences could be far more severe. Combined with all the other effects of the disease, it could kill me.      But here’s the thing: I’m not worried I’ll die. I’m resilient and I’m lucky enough to have excellent health insurance in a region with the best doctors and hospitals in the world (for those who can afford them.) What bothers me is that tens of millions of Americans have far, far less support. Coronavirus is showing a powerful transmission effect like no disease of its kind – with evidence that human carriers are most contagious before they have symptoms, before they even know they pose a risk. If you do the math from that and add in its relatively high fatality rate, it’s clear that many of those same people are in grave danger. Also, they could quickly overrun our hospital infrastructure.      With the defunding of the Centers for Disease Control, the dumpster fire of the COVID-19 tests, the Trump Administration’s bans on states tapping Medicaid, inadequate sick leave provisions and the general lack of a safety net for the most vulnerable Americans, we simply don’t have the capacity to deal with such an onslaught. Just read the accounts of Italian doctors or news that Seattle’s blood supply is at risk of running out to get a sense of what’s in store for us.      So, as someone at risk of having to tap that medical infrastructure himself one day, I have an obligation to my fellow human beings to try to avoid doing so.      That’s why I’m going for extreme social distancing. Since I can’t control my family’s occasional interactions with others on the outside – and certainly not those people’s interactions with everyone else in their social networks – I need to separate myself from those closest to me.      It’s also why I got my family tested since we were lucky enough to have access to the new drive-through facility in New Rochelle, N.Y. It was less uncomfortable than I expected. But, man, those hazmat suits have a way of sending one’s mind to all those Hollywood versions of the apocalypse. (See photo above.)      We should have the test results in two days. Stay tuned.

42404201,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdha5S,1584363600,Vertalo to Tokenize 22 Securities Worth $200M on Tezos Blockchain,"More than 20 companies expect to tokenize securities on the Tezos blockchain, representing some $200 million in deals, through a new partnership with fintech merchant bank DealBox and software provider Vertalo.      Announced Monday, the partnership will see Vertalo tokenize 22 different securities issued by DealBox’s clients, providing data management services and providing liquidity, Vertalo CEO and co-founder Dave Hendricks said. His firm is also a registered transfer agent with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      Hendricks told CoinDesk his company is essentially a technology provider for this partnership, while DealBox is the actual intermediary between the clients and the tech firm. This is preferable, he said, because, while Vertalo can work directly with issuers, the company prefers to work with ""channel partners.”      The move more than doubles the number of customers using Vertalo for digital security issuance. The company had 18 customers as of January 2020.      “The private assets are a bigger market than public securities. Because of the antiquated methods for asset management, and for ownership of private assets, owners of private assets cannot obtain liquidity,” Hendricks said, saying tokenizing might be able to boost liquidity.      The move comes a month and a half after Vertalo formally picked the Tezos network as its default blockchain for issuing securities. The company supports securities issued on Tezos and Ethereum, but said in January it would encourage customers to switch to the former when possible.      John Nance, DealBox’s president and chief investment officer, told CoinDesk the partnership would help build out market infrastructure for digital investments.      “This idea of crowdfunding and using online investment platforms is pretty new,” Nance said, adding that more established companies might not have the necessary plumbing to support these types of securities issuance.      DealBox previously saw two securities issued on the Stellar blockchain, but is hoping to potentially migrate to Tezos. “We’re going to be bringing a significant amount of capital to the Tezos platform,” Nance said.

42404213,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhaFI,1584362063,Bitcoin's Ransomware Problem Won't Go Away,"J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.      Bitcoin-based ransomware attacks are an interesting phenomenon. But who cares? They’re tiny.      That was pretty much my opinion about ransomware until a few months ago. I formed it after reading a paper in early 2018 that used blockchain analysis to measure the ransomware market. The authors concluded just $13 million in bitcoin (BTC) had been paid out in ransom from 2013 to 2017, a ""relatively low” amount compared to the “hype surrounding the issue.”      But headlines throughout 2018 and 2019 indicate this benign view may no longer be valid.      Whereas early ransomware strains such as Locky asked for ransoms of just 0.5-1 bitcoins (~$500 at 2016 bitcoin prices), the size of a typical ransom demand has exploded. In May 2019, the cities of Riviera Beach and Lake City, both in Florida, paid $600,000 and $500,000 in ransom, respectively, to regain access to computer systems infected by ransomware newcomer Ryuk. Crippled by Doppolemayer in late 2019, a Canadian insurer paid $905,000 in ransom, much of which eventually made its way to Bitfinex.      See also: J.P. Koning – Lightning Solves Bitcoin’s Speed Problem, but Watch Out for Fraudsters    The range of institutions being hit has been expanding as well. Whereas the first wave of attacks was mainly focused on the consumer market, the new wave has targeted institutions corporations and governments. According to Armor, a security company, 72 U.S. school boards were hit by ransomwarehttps://www.armor.com/reports/11-new-us-school-districts-compromised-by-ransomware-a-total-of-72-educational-institutions-in-2019-reports-armor/ in 2019, or around 1,039 schools.    What is ransomware? It is malicious software that takes control of a computer, say by encrypting files or threatening to publicly expose data. It only releases that control after receiving a ransom payment.      Ransomware predates bitcoin. Ransom-A, a 2006 strain of ransomware, froze victims' computers and would only release them when $10.99 had been transferred by Western Union. Cryzip required $300 in ransom to be paid via e-gold, an early digital gold payment system. Another ransomware outbreak in 2011 impersonated law enforcement agencies such as the London Metropolitan Police or the Federal Bureau of Investigation and required payment via e-money or prepaid cards like MoneyPak, Ukash or PaySafeCard.      All of these payment routes are relatively difficult to trace, which is why they were popular with extortionists. But they had weaknesses, too. Western Union requires at least some identification. Prepaid options like MoneyPak have dollar caps, which limits their ability to facilitate large ransom payments.    Any payments network is subject to a calculus of legitimacy. Once the percentage of illicit transactions reaches a certain percentage, the system becomes stigmatized.    Bitcoin has all sorts of advantages. Ransom payments can be any size, payments can never be frozen, and the network is global. And so ever since the 2013 appearance of Cryptolocker, the first strain of bitcoin ransomware, bitcoin has become the preferred payment method for ransomware operators.      If the bitcoin ransom market was initially quite small until 2017, how much bigger has it become? In a recent RSA security conference, FBI agent Joel DeCapua suggested that between October 2013 and autumn of 2019, $144 million in bitcoin ransom payments had been paid.      To arrive at this number, DeCapua recreated methods used in an earlier 2018 study by a team that included Google and Princeton researchers. This team traced a total of $16 million in bitcoin ransom payments between 2013 until August 2017. Their method relies on finding seed bitcoin addresses – addresses from which a ransom had been paid – and techniques like clustering to back out the total amount of ransom associated with each ransomware family.      Assuming continuity between the earlier Google/Princeton study and the FBI's newer effort, around $128 million in bitcoin has been paid as ransom between August 2017 and the end of 2019. That's a big pick-up in ransom volume! DeCapua's presentation reveals that between February 2018 and October 2019 Ryuk alone accounted for $61 million in ransom.      Ransomware has become more sophisticated. Whereas early strains like Cryptolocker and Locky indiscriminately targeted computers for small amounts, Ryuk operators carefully select a specific target, usually large organizations like a city government or corporation. Once inside the victim's network, the hackers move laterally through the system to compromise as much data as possible. This allows them to extract massive ransom payments. According to Coveware, in the fourth quarter of 2019 the average ransom payment doubled to $84,116, up from $41,198 in the previous quarter.    Why it matters    Ransomware could have big effects on the bitcoin ecosystem.      I'd suggest that any payments network is subject to a calculus of legitimacy. Once the percentage of illicit transactions reaches a certain percentage of total transactions, the system becomes stigmatized. A chill sets in. The public, politicians, law enforcement, and regulators begin to protest, and the system is either retired or its operators are forced to reform it.      E-gold encountered this tipping point in 2007. The e-gold network had become a popular venue for selling compromised credit card numbers, and the FBI shut it down. Or take Western Union, which had become a popular way to run scams like law enforcement fraud or “wire money to get me out of jail” scams. Not only did Western Union have to implement new anti-fraud measures, but it had to pay a half billion dollar fine to the FTC.      MoneyPak, owned by Green Dot Bank, has also brushed up against the legitimacy point. Due to the growing popularity of MoneyPak in telephone confidence scams, Green Dot's founder Steve Streit was called in front of the Senate's Committee on Aging in late-2014. Streit maintained that only $30 million out of $20 billion in value loaded in 2013 (just 0.25 percent) could be attributed to fraud. Nevertheless, Streit would choose to deactivate MoneyPak in 2015. When it was brought back online a year later, the system had been reformed. A new customer information process ensured that only KYC'ed users could receive MoneyPak funds.      See also: Cash Is the New Safe Haven as Crypto, Gold Continue to Tank      Gift cards have also been hitting up against the legitimacy point. Gift card scams caught the attention of attorney generals in Pennsylvania and New York. In 2018 they pressured Walmart, Best Buy, and Target into announcing measures to cut down on gift card scams including limiting card face values to $500.      I have no idea if bitcoin is close to reaching a critical level in the calculus of legitimacy. But the usage of bitcoin by crooks who cripple schools and health care providers makes for terrible optics. If enough voters have been hurt by these attacks, that serves as fertile breeding ground for political and regulatory pushback.      The recently proposed Crypto-Currency Act of 2020, for instance, calls for ""the tracing of transactions"" to be built into each cryptocurrency. In theory, tracing would help cut down on ransom attacks. But such a measure seems unlikely it could be implemented. Green Dot and Western Union are centralized and can be easily modified, but bitcoin is anarchic, which means that there is no easy way to force this sort of change.      If ransomware has forced bitcoin over the legitimacy line, the pushback is likely to be felt at the infrastructure surrounding bitcoin, such as exchanges. Perhaps exchanges would be confined to sending or receiving funds from/to identified addresses. Or they may be prevented from receiving bitcoins from services that mix coins to obfuscate their transactional histories      The other possibility is that as a shiny newcomer, bitcoin is exempt. When the topic of ransomware came up at the 2019 U.S. Conference of Mayors, 225 mayors resolved to avoid paying ransoms. Their anger was primarily directed at the hackers, not the payment mechanism. The same calculus that applies to other payments systems doesn’t seem to apply to bitcoin – for now at least.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/16/bitcoins-ransomware-problem-wont-go-away,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/907f8ece95fbe469b5bc320350bf63549993e672-1250x703.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404209,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhaDK,1584360000,Does Crypto Need Circuit Breakers? Last Week’s Price Crash Ignites a Debate,"Traders in cryptocurrencies have long extolled the virtues of their market’s 24/7/365 nature.      Now, after a brutal week of sell-offs and flash crashes, some players are calling for what would have been unmentionable, if not unthinkable, even during the cryptocurrency market’s near-collapse in 2018 – “circuit breakers.”  These are automatic stoppages put in place should prices fall below specified levels. Implemented at stock exchanges after the “Black Monday” crash in 1987, circuit breakers are meant to essentially throw sand in the gears of a plummeting market.      Cryptocurrency markets have no such guardrails, which helps explain why, in a matter of a dozen minutes Thursday, bitcoin (BTC) endured a 21 percent crash. For the day, it lost 31.5 percent of its value.      By contrast, in the equity markets, stocks tumbled as well, but not nearly as much. When the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq opened Thursday morning, trading halted almost immediately. That’s because the S&P 500 index opened more than 7 percent down from the previous day, triggering a “Level 1” circuit breaker. This marked the second time in a week trading curbs were imposed on the big U.S. equity exchanges; Tuesday saw circuit breakers triggered as well      (Circuit breakers were also set off on Sunday, when futures contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 5 percent after the Fed announced lower rates and $700 billion in bond purchases, and again on Monday.)      “Today's price moves in crypto are a strong argument for industry-wide circuit breakers,” tweeted Multicoin Capital’s managing partner Tushar Jain on Thursday. “The crypto markets structurally broke today & leading exchanges need to work together to prevent a repeat.”      “The entire DeFi ecosystem almost died today. Several large market participants went bust,” he went on to tweet. “Many traders literally could not get money to the exchanges fast enough to trade due to blockchain congestion & the extreme volatility was then made worse.”      Cryptocurrencies' long-term success depends on whether exchanges can chill volatility, according to Jain.      “If we just all need to accept that crypto can drop by 60%+ in a day that *severely* limits the usefulness of this tech,” he subsequently tweeted. “Exchanges' incentives are aligned with market growth. If markets can drop 60%+ in a day, the addressable market for this tech is much smaller.”    Speed bumps    As it now stands in the U.S. stock markets, both Level 1 and Level 2 (at 13 percent down) curbs lead to a 15-minute halt in trading (provided they occur before 3:25 p.m.) on stock exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq.      A Level 3 circuit breaker (20 percent decline) stops stocks from trading for the rest of the day.      Commodity exchanges like the CME have slightly different levels and even have “limit up” circuit breakers that kick in when futures contracts on stock indices trade above 5 percent in pre-market or after-hours trading.      The levels have gotten more stringent since the 2008 financial crisis, but the gist remains the same: Give traders – and automated systems – time to process the onslaught of orders and cool off before making things worse in a panic.      There are even more intricate rules for individual stocks. And similar curbs are found on other exchanges all over the world.      In lieu of such trading curbs, all the crypto markets have to serve as speed bumps are the exchanges’ occasional failures to process heavy volume.    ‘Insane theory’    Several major exchanges — save Coinbase and Bitstamp, prominently — were plagued by outages of some kind Thursday. Most notably, BitMEX was offline “for maintenance” for a total of one hour with a couple of outages during a day that saw hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidations.      Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of Alameda Research and cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX, questioned the timing of BitMEX going offline just as bitcoin was taking one of its worst plunges in its 11-year history.      In a tweetstorm prefaced with “Insane theory of the day,” Bankman-Fried postulated that BitMEX purposely shut down briefly to stave off a complete collapse in bitcoin. Bitcoin “rallied without the gigantic sell wall of the BitMEX [liquidations],” he said.      Not allowing all the liquidations to take place and then going offline as bitcoin’s price made its way toward $3,700 removed a tidal wave of bitcoin hitting the market. That allowed prices to quickly rebound above $5,000 thus making liquidations unnecessary.      BitMEX denied that was its intention and fired back at Bankman-Fried.      “’Insane’ is right. Sam, you know better than to deal in this type of conspiracy theory, especially since you operate a platform in the space,” the company’s official Twitter account said. “There is no conceivable reason why a platform like BitMEX - which has operated for over 5 years and counting - would lower itself to the degree you proposed to avoid a situation for which it is already prepared.”      “Sorry for suggesting it!” Bankman-Fried apologized. “I think I'm a bit confused why you're interpreting it so negatively though–I didn't intend it that way at all.”      Yet, whether or not such outages were intentional is beside the point, because they served as de facto circuit breakers, according to Jain.      “It is clear that those exchanges going down helped prevent further market volatility and allowed the market to stabilize,” he told CoinDesk in an email.    Dreaming the impossible dream    And it may be the only way circuit breakers could ever be implemented in cryptocurrency markets, noted Larry Tabb, founder and research chairman at TABB Group.      On stock exchanges, the companies agree to list their shares on an exchange, which could then halt trading with the equivalent of a flick of the switch.      Not so with unregulated cryptocurrency trading, where hundreds of exchanges can all trade a similar asset like bitcoin and it’s fairly easy for individuals to transfer that asset from one exchange to another.      Putting in circuit breakers “would be hard given the heterogeneous nature of the crypto market,” Tabb said to CoinDesk in an email. “There isn’t one regulator (many aren’t regulated at all), there isn’t one protocol, nor one data consolidated data feed.”      “So even if you wanted to implement one – how would you do it?” he went on to muse. “What if exchange X tripped a breaker, how would Exchange A know and why would they stop trading? In fact, if X were to shut down, it would be in A’s best interest to stay open as the trading from X may migrate to A.”      (A few hours after emailing CoinDesk, TABB Group posted to its website that it was shutting down “effective immediately,” citing business challenges exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis.)    Internal debate    For the time being, at least, circuit breakers may not be put in place as policy but the debate will likely rage on, even within exchanges themselves.      “Circuit breakers can only be used on a fully monopolistic exchange,” tweeted Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Binance’s CEO, in response to a Cointelegraph piece about circuit breakers. “Free market doesn’t work that way. #btc is traded on many exchanges.”      The Cointelegraph article cited a piece in Forbes explaining circuit breakers in stocks, specifically because it was linked by Catherine Coley.      “In crypto, the concept of circuit breakers is [mind-blowing],” she tweeted. “It's good to be aware of how other markets (S&P 500) handle volatility and liquidity concerns.”      She closed her tweet with the hashtag “#EducateDontIntimidate”      Coley is the CEO of Binance U.S., the American subsidiary of Binance.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/16/does-crypto-need-circuit-breakers-last-weeks-price-crash-ignites-a-debate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff092a8ee7cf062b6d27030a32826f36d1a54e06-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404216,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhaHG,1584358251,Bitcoin Sinks Below $5K Despite Fed Reserve's Slashing of Interest Rates,"Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped below $5,000 even as market uncertainty in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak pushed the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to zero.      The cryptocurrency slumped below $5,000 as the European trading day got underway, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. After breaching the psychological milestone at just before 07:00 UTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap was coming close to falling past $4,500 at 08:00 at press time, down 16 percent over 24 hours.      Other cryptocurrencies have experienced double-digit falls, too. At the time of writing, ether (ETH) was down by over 18 percent, with XRP (VRP) fell by 15 percent and Litecoin (LTC) by 16 percent. The total market cap for the digital asset class has plunged by more than $20 billion since Sunday morning, according to CoinMarketCap.      The sell-off came hours after the Federal Reserve announced a range of actions Sunday night to help support financial markets shaken by the coronavirus' effect on the global economy.      Chief among them was another emergency cut to interest rates, this time by a full percentage point, to 0.0-0.25 percent – the lowest since 2015 – as well as a $700 billion asset purchase of U.S. Treasury bills. Following the announcement, other central banks, including those of Japan, Australia and New Zealand, also unveiled their own stimulus packages.      Despite being the largest intervention since the 2008 financial crisis, a mass sell-off across asset classes continued as market confidence in the ability of central banks to mitigate the effects of a possible recession fell to a low ebb.      Bitcoin's movements have mirrored those of the traditional markets during this crisis, countering the popular safe-haven narrative. After spiking by as much as 14 percent immediately following the Fed's announcement, it quickly corrected and continued on a strong downwards trajectory.      In a note Monday, eToro analyst Adam Vettese said that ""double-digit falls for crypto assets"" came as investors started to ""dump risk assets without prejudice.""      Meanwhile, Bobby Ong, COO of CoinGecko, told CoinDesk: ""In my opinion, the price drop below $5,000 today is due to [crypto derivatives exchange] Bitmex's liquidations. Some traders believe Bitmex has a huge backlog of liquidations to be done from last week’s crazy free fall, which saw price fall 50 percent.”      As reported, the sharp fall in bitcoin prices last Thursday triggered the most long-short liquidations on BitMEX in 16 months.",NEGATIVE,BTC | LTC,BTC | FIAT | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/16/bitcoin-sinks-below-5k-despite-fed-reserves-slashing-of-interest-rates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af1aceda9eac370f9dc2c91a2dd3f9235cd3ffe5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404200,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdha4T,1584349200,SEC Proposal Could (Eventually) Unleash Security Token Sales,"Companies looking to raise funds via security token offerings (STOs) might soon get some relief from regulatory burdens in the U.S.      The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published a proposal to amend its capital formation rules for early stage startups of all stripes earlier this month. If adopted, the modified rule would raise the cap on proceeds to $75 million from $50 million for security offerings sold under Regulation A+ and to $5 million from $1 million for Regulation CF (crowdfunding).      These rules, which put the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012 into practice, allow companies to raise funds from the public without having to register as a public company.      More broadly, the proposed rule amendment could mark a shift in how the SEC perceives the token space.      “I think there’s also a bit of recognition from the SEC that the world is changing and they’re going to adapt which I think is very good and healthy,” said Muneeb Ali, CEO of Blockstack, which raised $23 million under a Reg A+ exemption last year.      The proposal may even be a sign the SEC is moving to “unclog the blockage of approvals” for companies looking to raise funds compliantly, said Vince Molinari, the former CEO and co-founder of regulated token trader Templum.      To be clear, young companies might not be able to raise funds soon, regardless of regulation, given the impact of coronavirus on the world’s economy. Both traditional and crypto markets saw immense volatility last week, with the S&P 500 tanking more than 7 percent twice and bitcoin (BTC)fluctuating between $3,900 and $8,000.      Rather, the SEC’s proposed changes may lay the groundwork for easier fundraising after an eventual recovery. The agency said it was seeking to “harmonize, simplify and improve” the guidelines surrounding capital formation.      “This particular proposed rule has great potential to help everyone, including those in the DLT/blockchain space to raise capital,” said Dina Ellis-Rochkind, counsel in the government affairs practice of the law firm Paul Hastings.      Daniel Gorfine, former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s fintech wing LabCFTC, agreed, saying the proposed rule change could expand the number of compliant security offerings based around tokens.    Internet fundraising    Enacted nearly a decade ago, the JOBS Act essentially provided a bridge between the internet and financial markets through investing, including the potential to expand investment opportunities including for small businesses and startups, Gorfine said.      “Then crypto and its underlying blockchain technology gained global mindshare towards the end of the last decade, and demonstrated how the Internet and social media could disintermediate traditional actors involved in the capital-raising process,” he said.      Initial coin offerings (ICOs), which became fashionable during the crypto bull market of 2017, allowed investors to directly purchase from ventures. “Unfortunately, many of the capital-raising efforts done through ICOs failed to comply with securities laws,” Gorfine noted. A raft of SEC enforcement actions followed.      Security tokens typically represent traditional securities, meaning they’re often backed by a real-world asset despite being built on a blockchain like Ethereum. Unlike most of the ICOs seen in 2017, security tokens are usually sold in a manner compliant with federal laws.      Ellis-Rochkind, who worked on the JOBS Act as a Senate staffer, noted that currently, most compliant token sales are using exemptions derived from the law.      The SEC’s proposal would make it easier for startups to conduct security token offerings, she said.      “The SEC is providing regulatory relief when it comes to private placement and exemptions,” she said. “It’s not a gigantic step, but it makes it easier to raise capital.”      The general public can weigh in on the amendment by emailing or filling out a form on the SEC’s website. The comment period will remain open for 60 days after the filing is published in the Federal Register, the official national document archive (the filing was not in the Register as of press time).      The comment period might be a good opportunity for stakeholders to seek clarity on some outstanding questions, such as when tokens might transition from something that appears to be a security to something that does not appear to, Ellis-Rochkind said. (Some crypto advocates believe there is room under the law for “utility tokens,” meaning tokens which have a function and do not meet the legal definition of a security, but which might still be used in sales and secondary trading. SEC Chair Jay Clayton disagrees with this premise.)      “If you believe, and I’m not saying I do, if you think the SEC is doing this case by case, if you believe that something can change into a utility or service or good, this is an opportunity to really put proposals in front of the SEC,” she said.    Better bang for buck    The immediate impact of the proposal would be that companies – including crypto startups – can raise more as they build out their systems and try to launch novel products.      The proposal doesn’t discuss tokenized offerings in depth, but it does consider them, Gorfine noted.      “By harmonizing the types of securities that could be offered through Reg CF and Reg A+, it stands to reason you could essentially run a tokenized security offering through the crowdfunding exemption up to a $5 million cap as proposed by the SEC,” he said.      Ali called the proposal “a step in the right direction,” and said he would expect more companies to look at the new caps.      While the Reg A+ fundraising cap is immense, he said the Reg CF change is likely far more significant for companies. Firms raising $50 million to $75 million are already established and likely on their second or third fundraising rounds, he said. Companies looking to raise through Reg CF are more likely to be early-stage firms.      “The difference between $1 million and $5 million is huge. I think $5 million is a very healthy limit and we might see a lot more people doing it,” he said. “The legal overhead is a lot lower with a Reg CF.”      Essentially, companies could see a greater return per dollar spent on legal fees and efforts.      But Molinari said the Reg A+ amendment might have a wider impact. In his view, the modified Reg A+ “could be a perfect mechanism” for digital securities, as it provides one possible answer to the question of “what is a security or what is not.”      In practice, how the SEC ultimately defines the lockup period for tokens will also have an impact, he said. If a company can begin trading tokens within a few months of the sale, it would benefit them. However, if a company has to wait longer than six months, it may not be worth it.      “If it takes six to 12 months it’s not going to get market acceptance because companies can’t afford to sit around and wait that long,” he said.      The proposed amendments would also create a “demo day” carve-out for companies which would let them present their businesses to potential investors without violating rules prohibiting “general solicitation.” In addition, the changes would require clearer communications to investors.    Long-term shift?    Gorfine noted that Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFTs) and Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) were mentioned in the proposal, though the SEC appears to be warning against these fundraising methods.      Molinari said he expects to see additional movement on the capital markets front in the long term.      “Ultimately, these developments could help satisfy the original intent of the JOBS Act by leveraging the potential of crypto and blockchain technology to give retail investors access to startup and small business investment opportunities,” Gorfine said.      Still, being able to raise funds is only half of the story, Ali said. In his view, how a security token project can transition to a decentralized, operational network is equally as important as the sale itself.      His company is working on defining how this might look, though there is currently no framework for other startups to look at.      “The SEC is actually taking a very deep, thoughtful look at these problems. It’s clearly on their agenda, it’s clearly on their minds, and I do think it’s a positive signal that they're highlighting crypto,” he said. While the agency is moving slowly, the enforcement actions it has taken may be helping regulate the space to protect against fraudulent token sales.      Ellis-Rochkind concluded by saying entities in the crypto space should engage with regulators at the right places. “This is the best chance of getting anything done,” she said.

42404196,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdha0X,1584334800,Price Drop Casts Pall Over Bitcoin Miners' Equipment Upgrades,"Bitcoin’s price crash last week has cast a shadow over mining firms, which have spent over half a billion dollars overhauling equipment over the last six months in preparation for the network’s next so-called halving.      Large bitcoin (BTC) mining farm operators in three countries told CoinDesk they’ve been on a buying spree to upgrade or expand facilities since September, reflecting a shared commitment to staying in the mining game for the long haul.      In May, the amount of freshly minted bitcoin awarded to a successful miner every 10 minutes or so will be programmatically split in half, hitting these firms’ top line. Since older equipment is becoming unprofitable even before the reward is cut, more than $500 million has been poured into the new, more efficient machines that can churn out more bitcoin, according to a CoinDesk estimate.      But bitcoin price’s recent plunge – crashing to below $5,000 on Friday and recording a 50 percent drop since its high above $10,000 in late 2019 – is creating greater uncertainty about mining farms’ profitability.      According to data from mining pool PoolIn, even the most efficient equipment on the market, such as MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20S and Bitmain’s AntMiner S17 Pro, is generating daily profits at a gross margin below 50 percent. That estimate is based on bitcoin’s current price and mining difficulty (a measure of how competitive it is to mine bitcoin) with an average electricity cost of $0.05 per kilowatt hour (kWh).      If bitcoin’s price does not bounce back to a higher point after the halving, which will essentially reduce mining revenue by half, mining farms would have to bear a longer payback period for their investment.      “We have been just heads down and kept mining, and bought a bunch of new machines,” said Zheng Xun, CEO of Hashage, which operates several sites in China’s mining hub in Sichuan province. “We already have a large scale so probably won’t buy any more for the time being. We’re maintaining cash flow to see how the market plays out after halving.”      That said, it remains to be seen how bitcoin’s overall computing power will react to bitcoin’s price drop in the coming weeks as older mining equipment is expected to shut down. If the computing power and the mining difficulty on bitcoin’s network decrease significantly, the incumbents will be able to mine more coins.      But for now, the network’s seven-day rolling average hash rate has shown a downtrend since last week’s price crash, falling to 108 exhashes per second (EH/s) from 118 EH/s around March 9.      Chris Zhu, co-founder of the mining pool PoolIn, said in an online panel via WeChat on Friday his expectation before the price crash was bitcoin’s hash rate would still rise slowly. Now he expects the computing power to go down by 20 to 30 percent in the coming months.    Buying spree      Global mining farms’ spending glut is reflected in the significant growth of bitcoin’s total computing power in the past half-year.      Since September 2019, the hashing power on the bitcoin network has increased by 30 percent, jumping from around 90 EH/s to most recently around 120 EH/s.      Given that most of the new equipment has been priced between $20 to $30 per terahash per second (TH/s), mining farm operators may have spent more than $600 million in recent months to get ready for the coming halving event. (For context, 1 EH/s = 1 million TH/s.)      Artem Eremin, product manager of 3logic, a reseller of bitcoin ASIC miners, said his clients in Russia and central Asia have started actively buying Bitmain’s AntMiner S17s since October, preparing to replace the old ones. (ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits, are computer chips customized for heavy-duty activities like mining.)      3logic now sells about 2,500 units of the newest equipment per month. It used to be around 5,000 units in October and November, Eremin said, although the buying momentum slowed in December. According to different estimates, a third to half of all mining computers in Russia might have been replaced with the new models by now.      Igor Runets, CEO of Bitriver, a mining venue in Bratsk, Russia, said his clients had been buying new ASICs quite actively since last fall but slowed down their purchases in January. “There was the Chinese New Year, the coronavirus outbreak, and then the buying activity just didn’t fully recover after that,” he said.      Similarly in China, larger mining farms have been revamping their facilities with top-of-the-line equipment in large quantities since the second half of 2019, when major manufacturers started to ship equipment in bulk.      Zheng said his firm scaled up its facilities by 30 percent with the latest machines supplied by Bitmain and MicroBT since the end of the summer in China last year and the deployment was in place prior to the Chinese New Year.      Some, like Gabriel Xia’s Spark Capital, a China-based fund, even started the replacement and upgrade work as early as summer 2019. “We sold all the old S9s in summer last year when its price at the second-hand market doubled and started buying new equipment,” he said.    Mining consolidation    Behind this recent buying momentum is the tremendous amount of investment that has poured into the bitcoin mining space in 2019 alone.      For perspective, bitcoin’s hashing power hit 1 EH/s for the first time around February 2016. It then took the network about 30 months to reach 50 EH/s in September 2018 – even after the 2017 bull run.      But it only took the network 15 months to double that level and reach 100 EH/s in January 2020.      This accelerated growth was made possible by major manufacturers such as Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan, which have produced and shipped more powerful equipment using more advanced computing chips.      But technological advancement also means new equipment has become much more expensive. With higher barriers to entry than in 2017, the space has been consolidating, squeezing out retail miners.      In 2017, even on the back of bitcoin’s bull run, it might not be so common to hear one customer place a single purchase order worth over $15 million for mining equipment. But things changed in 2019.      “With an order like 100 million yuan [$15 million] in 2017, you might be the biggest miner across the network,” said Xia, whose firm has been mining since 2016. By 2019, “$15 million would only make you just an ordinary big customer.”    Leveraged risk    Traditionally, mining farms would sell fresh bitcoins to fund their operations. However, over the last couple of years, a new market for financial services emerged to help them get working capital even if they want to “hodl” (bitcoin slang for holding rather than selling).      Xia said Spark Capital’s mined assets have been pledged as collateral for loans it took out to pay utility bills and expand operations. The firm is betting it will be able to sell the coins at a higher price later, and in the meantime it’s shortening the time it takes for the machines to pay for themselves.      “We are looking at a longer term when we scale up,” he said.      Echoing that strategy, Dmitry Ozersky, CEO of Eletro.Farm, a farm operator in Kazakhstan, said 90 percent of his clients don’t sell their mined coins regularly, instead waiting for big price surges.      “Some sold at $12,000, but are now waiting for the price to get above $10,000 again,” he said.      Cynthia Wu, vice president and head of custody at Matrixport, Bitmain’s crypto financial services spinoff, said the startup now boasts up to 200 large farms as clients. And out of around $100 million in outstanding loans, the vast majority was borrowed by miners to pay for electricity bills and new construction, she said.      But what goes side by side with that optionality is the risk of having their pledged collateral force-liquidated when bitcoin’s price tumbles more than 50 percent in two days.      With major lenders enforcing an average 60 to 70 percent collateral rate, a borrower would face the imminent risk of their pledged bitcoin being force-liquidated unless they choose to pledge additional assets. That’s even assuming they borrowed when bitcoin’s price was at its recent high of $11,000.    Reluctance to sell    As to the liquidation strategy, Wu said it may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.      “In the U.S., people would sell because this is how they manage their cash flow. But in China, miners are more long-term hodlers, they are more reluctant to sell. In China, it’s a very typical miner mentality: not spending much of what you mine,” she said.      Sharif Allayarov, head of Matrixport’s business in Russia, says the industry’s old-timers, who've been out there since 2012 or so, are also usually hesitant to sell.      “Newcomers are trying to jump into fiat as soon as they can, but as they stay in the business and see crypto grow, they are becoming less likely to liquidate fast,” Allayarov said.      Ethan Vera, CFO and co-founder at mining pool Luxor Tech, said there are definitely miners interested in borrowing money to pay bills but “those are usually OGs in the space that are long-time miners and very bullish on it.”      Newcomers want to find ways to limit their exposure to a price drop, he said.      “In general a lot of professionals are entering the mining space in North America. They are from investment banking, corporate finance, oil and gas backgrounds. They historically use financial instruments as a way to hedge their business risk,” Vera said. ”My conversation with these large miners want to find ways to limit their exposure to the value of hashrate and the price of bitcoin.”      Neither are they keen on trading derivatives – at least not in Russia, Runets and Ozersky said. The crypto futures and options market is not mature enough at the moment and miners got into this game to profit from the risk, not to spend money hedging against it, Ozersky said.      However, Matrixport saw some interest for its option product, Wu said. Out of about 70,000 BTC worth of options traded at the platform since the product was launched in October, big miners accounted for around 70 percent.      “They want to be more protected when the market moves,” Wu said. “Miners also want to speculate [on the price] to enhance their yield.”    So long, S9    Meanwhile, the latest overhaul strategy among large mining farms also leads to a legacy issue: What do they do about older mining equipment like AntMiner S9s and equivalent models, which have dominated the mining market since 2017?      With the bitcoin halving two months away, and bitcoin’s price down to the $5,000 range, way under the breakeven point for these older models around $8,000, will they all get shut down soon?      “Everybody is trying to get rid of S9s,” said Eletro.Farm’s Ozersky. Yet, he believes S9s are far from done yet. The bottom line is, it all boils down to a miner’s strategy.      At Bitriver, which is hosting 70 megawatts to power ASICs for his clients, only around 25 percent of the equipment are S9s, Runets said. “Those who wanted to sell them have already sold.”      Spark Capital’s Xia, whose firm already sold all of its S9s, estimates that S9s are only contributing around 20 to 25 percent to bitcoin’s total network.      “People have different strategies: some wanted to switch from old machines to the new ones, some opted to buy old ones cheap, hoping to pay them out quickly,” Runets said.      Those who stick to S9s don’t want to pull the plug even if they are now working on the verge of breakeven, Runets said. “Nobody is switching off, and until the halving, people are going to squeeze everything they can from their old ASICs.”      According to these mining farms, there’s an option to switch S9s to a lower energy consumption at 700 watts instead of 1,600 watts, churning out 9 TH/s instead of 13 TH/s.      Similarly, some, like Electro.Farm and mining pool Poolin, are also offering clients the option to boost the productivity of S9 by pairing up two units into one.      The idea for both options is to increase the overall gross margin so that S9s may just still bring a daily profit – however modest – at an average electricity cost up to 5 cents per kWh.    Cheap juice    Further, there are also individuals or smaller farms that are somehow capable of finding much cheaper electricity than larger farms.      “If you can find an electricity cost of $0.02 per kWh, sure, you can still play with S9s,” said Hashage’s Zheng, referring to the imminent rainy summer season in China that comes after bitcoin’s halving schedule in May.      Individuals in Siberia could even use an S7 with some profit until the end of February, Eremin said. Retail miners, although fewer and fewer, still can be found also in Kazakhstan and in the breakaway region of Abkhazia.      “But here’s another thing: These old ASICs are occupying space and earning less money for the farms as they usually charge a fee off each kilowatt,” Eremin said.      So big farms are incentivized to replace old ASICs with new ones.      For now, Runets said he does not want to see parts of his farm go offline abruptly, so Bitriver is planning to offer temporary energy price discounts to keep its clients’ machines buzzing.      But in the long term, Xia said, “the S17, S19 or MicroBT’s M20 and M30 will become the new S9 in the next cycle.”      David Pan contributed reporting.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,"Wolfie Zhao, Anna Baydakova",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/16/price-drop-casts-pall-over-bitcoin-miners-equipment-upgrades,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6591d4e717a9b9f0c06d20a1dc88599c35663d0-1000x668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
