The surge which had happened at the end of the weekend had seen the price of Bitcoin rise over 10% to surpass $39,000, gaining over $4,000 within a day. Brian Kelly agreed with show host Melissa Lee saying that the short-covering contributed to the price surge. Kelly explained that a high number of short coverings around the asset saw the price shooting up as the weekend drew to a close. A lot of factors have been speculated to have given rise to the price spike.

Catalyst For Price Spike Brian Kelly addressed the speculations of the Amazon news being the main catalyst for Bitcoin&apos;s price surge. Kelly explained that the Amazon news had been out in the market about a week before the momentum picked up. According to Kelly, the high amount of shorts coupled with the news of Amazon and Tether&apos;s news led to a &apos;big short squeeze&apos; as the weekend drew to a close, which is when the market is usually less liquid than usual.

BlockFi tweeted on Wednesday that the postponement followed ongoing talks between BlockFi and NJ BOS “to provide more details about the BIA.”      NJ BOS’s order was originally set to go into effect on July 22, and then was delayed until Thursday.      BlockFi is facing similar scrutiny of its interest-bearing crypto accounts from Texas and Alabama. In its tweet, BlockFi said it is in ""active dialogue with multiple regulators"" regarding its BIAs.      NJ BOS has argued that the BlockFi Interest Accounts amount to unregistered securities, while BlockFi has said that they are not.      “We firmly believe that the BIA is lawful and appropriate for crypto market participants, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to fight for consumers rights to earn interest on their crypto assets,” BlockFi wrote in its tweet on Wednesday.      BlockFi had no additional comment on the matter, while the NJ BOS could not be immediately reached.      BlockFi has maintained that the New Jersey order does not affect existing BlockFi customers or any of its other products, a claim the NJ BOS order appears to support.      Less clear, though, is the extent to which this could affect new BlockFi customers and whether the order’s impact could spread beyond New Jersey.      NJ BOS has said BlockFi holds $14.7 billion in assets through its BIA product, although how much of that is held by New Jersey consumers is unclear.      The New Jersey-based company has indicated it plans to go public in the next 12 to 18 months.

42387382,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjcX,1627507531,New Infrastructure Bill Looks to Raise $30B Through Crypto Taxes,"A bipartisan infrastructure bill in Congress proposes to raise $28 billion from crypto investors by applying new information reporting requirements to exchanges and other parties.      According to a draft copy of the bill shared with CoinDesk, any broker that transfers any digital assets would need to file a return under a modified information reporting regime. The draft defined digital assets as “any digital representation of value … recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger” or related technology. It also includes decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer marketplaces in its definition of brokers.      A separate summary of the bill further clarified that cryptocurrencies are treated as a subsection of the broader digital asset umbrella.      “The provision includes updating the definition of broker to reflect the realities of how digital assets are acquired and traded,” the document said. “The provision further makes clear that broker-to-broker reporting applies to all transfers of covered securities within the meaning of section 6045(g)(3), including digital assets.”      This could bring up to $30 billion into the bill’s “pay-fors,” according to a fact sheet also shared with CoinDesk.      ""Additionally, digital assets are added to the current rules requiring businesses to report cash payments over $10,000,"" the fact sheet said.      The crypto reporting requirements are among a list of 14 new ""pay-fors"" included in the bill, which also includes repurposing COVID-19 relief funds, auctions, Superfund fees, fuel sales and other sources of revenue.      Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk the draft language could mean a number of individuals interacting with crypto may have to start reporting their transactions.      “We interpret this to mean software wallet developers, hardware wallet manufacturers, multisig service providers, liquidity providers, DAO token holders and potentially even miners,” she said.      The $1 trillion infrastructure bill also includes provisions for funding public transit, particularly passenger rail; investments in bridges, clean drinking water and wastewater infrastructure; and high-speed internet access for all Americans, among other provisions, according to a White House fact sheet.      The U.S. Senate may conduct a test vote as early as Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said.      In a statement, U.S. President Joe Biden praised the team that negotiated the bill, saying neither side got 100% of what it wanted.      “Everyone from unions to business leaders and economists left, right and center believe the public investments in this deal will mean more jobs, higher productivity, and higher growth for our economy over the long term. Experts believe that the majority of the deal’s benefits will flow to working families,” he said in a statement.      A previous Biden budget proposal also includes new crypto reporting requirements.

42387381,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjbH,1627504964,The IMF's Self-Serving Case Against Bitcoin,"In June, I wrote that El Salvador’s decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender was “the most significant single development in the history of cryptocurrency so far.” If anything, that was confirmed when the International Monetary Fund, a global development bank closely tied to the world’s richest countries, quickly declared that the move raised “a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues.” The statement amounted to a veiled threat, because El Salvador was in negotiations for a $1 billion loan from the IMF. But the IMF at the time didn’t provide any real detail about what “issues” it saw with the national adoption of bitcoin.      This week, we got more insight into what those issues might be.      Well, not really.      What we did get is an IMF blog post titled “Cryptoassets as National Currency? A Step Too Far” that amounts to a laundry list of boilerplate high-level critiques of cryptocurrency. It includes little nuance about their purported weakness as a national currency, though, and is even less specific about El Salvador’s plan. Though it does include some significant points, most of the statement could have been cribbed from a Peter Schiff Twitter rant: Its main arguments include cryptocurrency’s volatility, use for money laundering and electricity demand, which range from irrelevant to outright false.      In fairness, it was an informal blog post meant for a broad audience. But the lack of subtlety from an entity that has huge sway over the well-being of many of the world’s most vulnerable people is disappointing, if not outright frightening. It would seem to reinforce the sense that the IMF’s objection to Bitcoinization is less about the stability of economies daring to innovate than about maintaining the IMF’s own position of power over them.    Fake crypto problems    I’ll dispense briefly with several of the points made in the IMF post. One is that the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them untenable for long-term debt obligations, or even for short-term applications like business pricing, with disruptive economic effects. This is a reasonable argument against adopting bitcoin as the sole currency of a sovereign nation today.      But it doesn’t address the actual proposal in El Salvador, which would maintain the country’s current currency for day-to-day pricing, payments and debts, while adding bitcoin as an option for both payments and government reserves. This could be seen as a transitional phase. The long game here would theoretically see bitcoin (or another crypto asset) adopted by a growing number of countries, which would eventually increase its stability against other currencies. Given crypto’s track record over the past decade, it’s not a scenario to bet against.      The second of the IMF’s specious claims is that crypto adoption would create money-laundering risk. Again, there are two rebuttals here. First and foremost, it is becoming increasingly clear that cryptocurrency has limited utility for money laundering, because while it’s impossible to stop, it’s also easily traced. Criminals themselves know that: Criminal activity on crypto networks declined 57% from 2019 to 2020 – from a miniscule $4.5 billion to an even more miniscule $1.9 billion, according to CipherTrace – while the value of cryptos as a whole more than doubled.      The second rebuttal, to engage in some whataboutism, is that normal banks handle demand for money laundering just fine. The United Nations estimated that $800 billion to $2 trillion of criminal proceeds is cleaned and hidden each year – at the top end, 33% more than the total circulating supply of all cryptocurrency in existence today.      The IMF also waves the flag of environmentalism by citing critiques of cryptocurrency’s electrical demand. The debate around mining bitcoin and fossil fuel emissions is certainly knotty and important, and crypto that has less of an impact on the environment should be an industry goal. But the critique borders on offensive when it’s being used as a bludgeon to discipline developing countries. The advanced economies that control the IMF spent decades creating the climate mess we find ourselves in. For them to turn around and use their own sins as a cudgel to keep smaller, less developed, and mostly vastly less polluting countries from making their own monetary decisions crosses the line from illogical to sadistic.    Real crypto problems    The IMF does cite two genuine issues with the use of crypto as a national currency – though even one of those is irrelevant to the case of El Salvador, which triggered all the hand-wringing in the first place.      The IMF rightly points out that adopting a global cryptocurrency as a national currency would remove a nation’s ability to set its own monetary policy. A normal national currency supply is expanded according to the needs of the economy, which is often important to maintaining economic growth.      But El Salvador hasn’t had control of its money supply for decades. Its primary national currency since 2001 has been the U.S. dollar. Seven other countries also use the dollar as their official currency, most either very small or struggling with a legacy of political instability. The list includes not only El Salvador, but also East Timor, Ecuador, Guam, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Panama and Zimbabwe. In theory, the dollar represents even greater risk to third-party adopters than bitcoin does, because the dollar can be weaponized in various ways for the benefit of the U.S. No less a crypto critic than British economist Frances Coppola has argued (in these pages) that switching to a neutral currency like bitcoin could be a stability upgrade for dollarized nations.      The second valid argument mooted by the IMF is simply that individuals need access to the internet to use crypto, and that access is quite limited worldwide. Only about 60% of the world’s population has mobile or hardwired internet access, and that’s significantly lower in the very same developing or unstable nations most likely to benefit from the adoption of a dollar alternative.      Again, though, that doesn’t entirely apply to El Salvador, because it’s keeping dollars in circulation alongside bitcoin, solving the daily payments problem. Broadly, such a dual-currency system could mean bitcoin would be used only semiregularly, for remittances or international payments, by everyday citizens. This is even more true of the possible use of bitcoin as a national reserve, because that’s the province of central banks that probably have decent broadband.      But it is nonetheless true that access limitations mean adoption of a purely digital currency system wouldn’t be equitable in most countries. So maybe one valid argument out of five isn’t so bad.    What’s really going on here?    It may seem puzzling that the IMF would throw so much ill-considered rhetorical spaghetti at the wall, as if only to see what sticks. In the most generous interpretation, it’s a deeply conservative institution whose knee-jerk opposition to change may play some helpful role in moderating any rushed moves into national adoption of cryptocurrencies.      But to play that role credibly, the IMF will have to strive for a lot more subtlety in its critiques. For now, its opposition to the growth of an alternative financial system has so little substance that it seems like nothing more than a very powerful institution defending its turf.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,David Z.

Quarter over quarter, transaction revenue rose by 3%, from $5.6 billion.      Part of PayPal’s transaction revenue comes from the company’s crypto buy, sell and hold product, but the company excludes crypto payments from total payment volume.      The payments giant also added 11.4 million in net new active accounts in Q2, down from the 23.3 million in year-earlier period and below the 14.5 million it added in Q1.      Overall, PayPal topped expectations with Q2 adjusted earnings of $1.15, abovethe consensus estimate of $1.12 according to FactSet.      Q2 2021 is the third quarter PayPal has reported earnings including results from its crypto buying and selling product. The company has reported in the past that customers who purchased crypto through the platform have been logging into PayPal twice as often as they were before they could buy crypto.      In April of this year, PayPal added crypto buy, sell, and hold options to its peer-to-peer payments platform Venmo.      “We’re seeing strong adoption in trading of crypto on Venmo,” PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said in this most recent earnings call.      PayPal is also working on the ability to transfer crypto to third party wallets and create a more seamless process for tax reporting, Schulman said.      Schulman said This isn’t the “main course” for the crypto offering at Paypal, however.      “We are clearly thinking about what the next generation of the financial system looks like, how we can help shape that,” Schulman said. “We are working with regulatory agencies, central banks across the world. The number of countries that are looking at central bank issued digital currencies is increasing rapidly.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/28/paypal-q2-transaction-revenue-rose-17-earnings-top-estimates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abe1f5de0ddf0ccbb250a9df3e03777cc24e4706-1920x1239.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387389,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjmb,1627504102,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Expected to Pause Before Next Rally,"Bitcoin buyers are in profit-taking mode as the cryptocurrency tests the $40,000 resistance level. Sentiment has significantly improved over the past week, although some analysts think it's time for a pause before another leg higher.      “BTC easily broke through $35K, but I think it will probably have a harder time going through $40K this time,” Justin Chuh, a senior trader at Wave Financial, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      “Miners & sellers are coming in to cash out once more and buyers unable to push it higher after absorbing that hit,” Chuh wrote.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $40328, +6.56%  Ether (ETH) $2308.8, +3.27%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4403.9, +0.056%  Gold: $1808.1, +0.5%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.233%, compared with 1.238%  Moving average watch    Sentiment can easily shift from bullish to bearish as bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase with strong overhead resistance.      “BTC was already rejected again by its 200-day moving average, just like in early June, but it should try again after a breather, and hopefully not crawling lower than $35K,” Chuh wrote.      “If (and when) bitcoin does cross the 200-day, this will signal confidence in the market and demonstrate to many players that the bulls have regained control of the market,” Alexandra Clark, a trader at U.K.-based digital-asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      For now, trading activity is sharply higher compared with June. Short-dated call options were actively traded Wednesday morning as bitcoin approached $40,000, according to data from Skew.    GBTC discount narrows    Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares have narrowed their discount relative to the underlying cryptocurrency held in the fund – possibly a sign that buyers are using the vehicle to bet on the recent recovery rally in digital-asset markets.      The GBTC shares traded at a discount of 6.6% to net asset value (NAV) on Tuesday, the smallest margin since June 22, based on data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The discount had widened to 15% in mid-June.      Some investors may have snapped up GBTC shares in hopes that the discount will evaporate with a bull revival in bitcoin. In that scenario, the buyers would reap any price gains on bitcoin while pocketing extra profit from a narrowing of the discount. (Grayscale Investments, which manages the trust, is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)    Ether trading volumes surge    The ether market grew three times faster than the bitcoin market did in the first six months of the year as large investors diversified into the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, according to crypto exchange Coinbase’s half-yearly review published on Monday.    Crypto CEOs are bullish    Crypto investors have just endured one of the toughest quarters on record. Despite a recent rebound, fears of overregulation, a clampdown on mining in China and environmental concerns have all contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Most CoinDesk 20 assets, which constitute about 99% of the crypto market by verifiable volume, finished the second quarter with negative returns.      The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) fell 40%, its third-worst quarter ever. Conversely, the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX) ended the quarter up 18.7%. While bitcoin has recovered some of its losses, the level of optimism is far from what it was at the start of the second quarter.      Some crypto CEOs, however, still expect a six-figure bitcoin price, saying that the medium-term outlook for the crypto market is positive, even if sentiment is not, CoinDesk’s Will Canny reports.    Why stablecoins are in the spotlight    Stablecoins have existed for roughly seven years, but talk about them has never been as heated as in recent weeks, not only within the crypto community but also among regulators and traditional market investors.      Much has been going on the world of stablecoins recently, and some of it can be overwhelming. Here are the three big things happening now:    Tether is under a cloud: As the most traded cryptocurrency in the market, USDT has become a backbone for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Over half of all bitcoin trades are made against it. However, Tether, the company behind the digital token, has been plagued by regulatory issues.  Regulatory heat: Stablecoins had a total market capitalization of $116 billion as of Monday, an almost fourfold increase since the start of this year, according to CoinMarketCap. As growth has increased, so has the attention from U.S. and other regulators.  Circle going public, other stablecoin issuers disclose more info: Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second largest stablecoin, has also been in the spotlight. Circle plans to go public through a merger with Concord Acquisition Corp., a publicly traded special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC). The deal would value the crypto financial services firm at $4.5 billion. Another stablecoin issuer, Paxos, also released for the first time a breakdown of reserves for its stablecoins, Paxos standard and the Binance-labeled BUSD. Some 96% of the reserves was held in cash and cash equivalents, while 4% was invested in U.S. Treasury bills as of June 30.  Altcoin roundup  XRP rallies: XRP, a cryptocurrency used by Ripple in its payments network, rallied to a five-week high on Wednesday after the company said it is targeting the $1.8 billion Filipino remittance market. The cryptocurrency changed hands at $0.74 during the European hours, hitting its highest level since June 21 and representing a 13% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.  Ether Trading Volume Surges: Ether's trading volume totaled $1.4 trillion in the January-to-June period, a 1,461% rise from $92 billion observed in the first half of last year.  Burger King Brazil accepts dogecoin: Burger King Brazil now accepts dogecoin (DOGE, +2.64%) as a payment method to purchase the fast-food chain’s Dogpper, a dog snack. The service has been available since Monday, according to the company’s official website, though users should check the availability of delivery in their region, the company said. Each Dogpper – a dog treat that plays on the name of Burger King’s best-known menu item, the Whopper – costs 3 DOGE. The company recommends purchasing a maximum of five units per order for “availability reasons.”  Relevant News:  Luxor Technologies Launches Index of Crypto Mining Stocks  Mining Difficulty Expected to Increase for the First Time Since China Crackdown  UBS Mulls Offering Prime Brokerage Services for Crypto ETPs to European Hedge Funds: Sources  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Discount Narrows as ‘Unlocks’ Pass  FTX Renames Blockfolio Trading App to … FTX  Robinhood Under Investigation for Finra Registration Violation  Other markets    Most digital assets on CoinDesk 20 ended up higher on Wednesday.

42387388,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjlL,1627503998,"Traders, Unswayed by Axie Infinity Hype, Are Aggressively Shorting AXS","Guess who may not be fans of the blazing Ethereum-based gaming platform Axie Infinity?      It’s crypto traders – surprising given that AXS, the governance token of Axie Infinity, has logged a year-to-date price return of over 7,000%, compared with bitcoin’s roughly 33% and ether’s 212%, according to Messari.      This trader bearishness could affect the price of the AXS token despite Axie Infinity being a blockchain-based project with solid fundamentals and great revenue models.      “The euphoric-herd mentality pushed the valuation to extremes and, as with any overcrowded trade, once the unwind takes place the price swings will be extremely volatile,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at London-based quantitative finance management firm Synergia Capital, said. “The problem is market timing – timing the top of the market – is notoriously difficult.”      Trading data from crypto exchanges shows futures traders have been aggressively taking short positions on AXS, betting the token’s price bull run will face downward pressure soon, as the perpetual futures market for AXS has consistently seen negative funding rates.      Read more: The NFT Game That Makes Cents for Filipinos During COVID      The funding rate refers to the cost of holding long/short positions in one crypto's perpetuals (futures with no expiry) market. The metric is used by exchanges offering perpetuals to balance the market and guide perpetual prices toward the spot price. A positive funding rate means longs are paying shorts to keep the position open, as the market is skewed bullish. A negative funding rate, meanwhile, implies a bearish sentiment towards the token associated with the perpetuals.      The funding rates for AXS perpetuals on the two major crypto exchanges offering such products, FTX and Binance, have been negative. At the time of writing, data from FTX shows the one-hour average annualized funding rate for AXS perpetuals was at -42.92%, while the eight-hour-basis funding rate of the AXS/USDT perpetuals on Binance has been negative for at least 14 days.      This bearish take by crypto traders looks odd as Axie Infinity, the Ethereum-based trading and battling game, has received much positive reaction from the market. The project has also quickly become the top protocol on the Ethereum blockchain by revenue.      Read More: Axie Infinity Token Price Doubles in 2 Days      Data from Token Terminal shows that Axie Infinity has logged the highest revenue in the past 30 days among all blockchain-based protocols, with roughly $148.7 million, only behind Ethereum blockchain itself, which is at $172.8 million.      Axie Infinity “is a company with a CEO, a parent company with privately owned equity, a real business model and rapidly growing revenues, all of which existed prior to Axie issuing its AXS token,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Los Angeles-based investment management firm Arca, wrote in his blog post dated July 12. “The token was issued to help bootstrap the growth of the company, and almost every customer and fan of the game had a chance to buy this token in the early days of its growth.”      The AXS token has also recovered well from the broader market sell-off on May 19, according to data from TradingView of Binance’s AXS/USDT pair.      Analysts said the difference in thinking between crypto traders looking at AXS and those hyped by the Axie Infinity project is not unexpected, especially after the May market crash. That’s because traders tend to take more aggressive trading strategies, hoping to maximize the potential returns.      “We just witnessed one of the most brutal crashes in crypto history,” Ashwath Balakrishnan, associate at blockchain research firm Delphi Digital, said. “Honestly, everyone was in disbelief at the beginning of this month when AXS started pumping. A lot of traders thought it was just a random market movement.”      Having missed out several price tops of AXS, crypto traders are trying to balance their “disbelief” that AXS has grown so rapidly with a ""trying-to-make-it-all-back"" mindset, according to Balakrishnan.      “When something goes parabolic, you have a large faction of people trying to short the top, so they start shorting on every new high,” Balakrishnan said. “And given this happened after people incurred losses or lost some of their unrealized profits, the stakes were higher for them and they shorted more aggressively.”    Institutions versus retail investors    Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at crypto exchange OKEx, also said that – based on the relatively balanced long and short ratio between AXS active buying volume and active selling volume on Binance, FTX and OKEx – it’s also possible that more institutional traders are taking shorting positions on AXS than retail traders.      “When there are more long accounts than short accounts, the funding would be negative because long accounts belong to retailers, and short accounts belong to institutional clients who hedge their funds,” Lai said.      Unlike Synergia Capital’s Vinokourov, who said the negative funding rate could lead to “unpredictable swings,” Lai said retail traders who are taking long positions can help AXS continue its rally.      “We do anticipate a significant response from retailers, as (Axie Infinity) is a project driven by consumers,” Lai said. “Even if a fund has a few short accounts, (AXS) may still outperform with many long accounts, resulting in a negative funding rate with a positive long-short ratio.""      OKEx launched trading products, including AXS margin, savings and USDT-margined perpetuals on Wednesday, Lai said.      But without further data partly because the market is still “nascent,” Vinokourov said that it is also hard to know whether Axie Infinity would continue to generate revenue at the current high level.      Market participants ""will not hesitate to switch from one hot toy to another – no different to the yield farming craze earlier in the year,” he said.",NEGATIVE,AXS,AXS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/28/traders-unswayed-by-axie-infinity-hype-are-aggressively-shorting-axs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0543a2aa1a7793827e4f1e7f9a044b128f2fe6a-1339x821.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387384,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjf3,1627502219,Mexico Regulator Says 12 Crypto Exchanges Are Operating Illegally,"Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) has accused 12 crypto exchanges of not complying with its reporting requirements.      According to Santiago Nieto Castillo, head of the agency, the 12 exchanges, whose names weren’t disclosed, are not registered with the agency and have been operating illegally, local newspaper El Economista reported on Wednesday.      ""We are generating cases so that the attorney general's office can operate,"" Nieto Castillo said during a seminar on financial intelligence and risk management.      UIF didn’t immediately respond to CoinDesk’s queries about the names of the crypto exchanges involved.      Nieto Castillo said that combating money laundering through cryptocurrencies is a priority for UIF.      ""A fundamental issue will be to analyze cryptocurrencies and their relationship with criminal groups. I am struck by the fact that many of the cryptocurrency platforms are installed in several municipalities in the state of Jalisco,"" Nieto Castillo said, referring to an area dominated by a drug cartel in Jalisco called Nueva Generación.      Following the enactment of the Fintech Law in 2020, exchanges started reporting transactions exceeding 645 units of account (UMAS, in Spanish), which are equivalent to M$57,804 (US$2,896).      So far, UIF has received close to 3,400 notifications from 23 exchanges that report information to the Mexican Tax Administration Service (SAT), Nieto Castillo said.      After receiving that information, UIF identified at least three potential money laundering cases through the use of cryptocurrencies, the official added.      One of the cases involves Nigerian citizens in Mexico City engaged in cyber fraud, who sent cryptocurrencies back to their home country, Nieto Castillo said.      Mexico’s UIF works under the supervision of the Secretariat of Finance and is in charge of analyzing information related to illicit money operations.      In June, Arturo Herrera, Mexico’s finance minister, said cryptocurrencies aren’t considered to be legal tender assets and aren’t treated as currencies under the country’s current regulatory framework.

42387379,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmja1,1627501852,"Uniswap Says It's Talking With PayPal, Robinhood and More in Deleted Video","Uniswap, Ethereum’s largest decentralized exchange by volume, is looking to expand into consumer finance – at least according to a deleted YouTube video from the EthCC conference that was held in Paris last week.      In a talk at the event, Ashleigh Schap, Uniswap's growth lead, said the team behind the trading protocol is in talks with well-known fintech companies to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) to the mainstream. (In a nod to the virtues of the decentralized web, the video is still available on IPFS.)      “We’re trying to put Uniswap and the rest of DeFi right there in those applications so that we can bring the dream of open, 100% uptime liquidity to the whole world,” Schap said. “PayPal wants to talk to us, E*Trade wants to talk to us, Stripe wants to talk to us.”      Uniswap Labs, EthCC, PayPal, E*Trade and Stripe did not reply to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.      After publication of this article, founder Hayden Adams tweeted that Uniswap Labs has not partnered with the companies mentioned in the EthCC talk. He said the video was deleted at Uniswap's request because ""we thought [it] could be interpreted to suggest we have relationships that we don't.""      According to Schap’s presentation, Uniswap is looking to build partnerships between consumer finance and DeFi using intermediary firms like Fireblocks, Paxos and Talos. Notably, Paxos built the platform that powers PayPal’s crypto service.      The partnerships could allow DeFi protocols to mesh into existing fintech offerings in a bid to provide a larger variety of assets, instant settlement and 24/7 accessibility.      “We’re talking to everyone about potential stuff, but nothing concrete or specific yet,” said a source familiar with the talks, speaking on the condition of anonymity.      Paxos and Fireblocks declined to comment.    TradFi meets DeFi?    Creating liquid markets is a difficult task for traditional exchanges that rely on costly and complex relationships with market makers. Uniswap is known in crypto parlance as an automated market maker, or code on a blockchain that makes it possible for traders to swap assets from various pools of liquidity.      The past year’s growth in the crypto market has shown fintech companies that there is consumer demand for cryptocurrencies and the products that DeFi has made widely available, Schap said at her EthCC presentation.      She added that pitching Uniswap is not as tough of a sell as it was years ago and that firms like PayPal and Stripe are becoming less resistant to what DeFi may offer.      ""To stay relevant with their user base is a huge, huge reason that all of these giants are starting to really look closely at working with something like Uniswap,"" Schap said, before mentioning speaking with Robinhood.      Traditional finance, however, still has its concerns with blockchain technology and the finality of on-chain transactions, Schap said in Paris. She said Uniswap’s current strategy is surveying the needs of large financial institutions when it comes to know-your-customer laws and any fears associated with transacting directly on a blockchain.

In an announcement Wednesday, Anchorage Digital said after a yearlong bidding process the law enforcement agency USMS Asset Forfeiture Division will be using its custodial services.      CoinDesk reported in April that crypto custodian BitGo was set to manage the USMS digital assets under a $4.5 million contract. But that deal appears to have fallen through.      ""We are unable to comment on BitGo, but Anchorage participated in more than a yearlong process, and in the end, we were chosen,"" a spokesperson from Anchorage told CoinDesk. ""There are many factors at play when it comes to a decision like the DOJ’s.”      Among its actions in dismantling organized crime operations, the USMS seizes assets that are the “proceeds of, or [are] used to facilitate, federal crimes.”      Recently, the USMS has seized more digital assets in its work.      Anchorage Digital said that it will also provide “such activities as accounting, customer management, audit compliance, managing blockchain forks, wallet creation, transformation of token assets into coin assets, etc., as well as future actions associated with the virtual currency forfeiture process.”      Representatives of USMS and BitGo did not immediately respond to CoinDesk.

42387387,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjk5,1627496906,Love Bitcoin? Mine Your Values,"Bitcoin is an ark, they say, in a sea of rising liquidity. Millions already have tickets. But where is it headed?      Satoshi engineered a vessel that to some extent steers itself. It’s more profitable to publish full blocks than empty ones, to cooperate rather than attempt a 51% attack and to run Bitcoin rather than a fork. This all works by design. The game theory of adoption, too, whereby early adopters are rewarded, guides the ship towards a safe and prosperous harbor.    Andrew M. Bailey is associate professor of Humanities at Yale-NUS College. Troy Cross is professor of Philosophy and Humanities at Reed College. Crypto Questioned is a forum to discuss the ideas and philosophies that drive the cryptocurrency industry.    But these incentive structures only set a rough heading. Perils remain. Mining could, in principle, centralize and hold the network hostage. Addresses could be blacklisted. Transactions could be censored. The protocol could even be modified to expand supply, destroy privacy or enable surveillance.      Beyond holding, what can you do about where the ship heads? Bitcoin’s cyber hornets are famously aggressive on Twitter, stinging Bitcoin’s perceived enemies, foreign and domestic. You, too, can call out dangers from the crow’s nest.      There is another, quieter way, more like nudging the wheel. The network requires sustenance; that ongoing work presents bitcoiners with opportunities to steer the ship aright. You can do this. And our thesis is that you should. Mine your values.      By “mine your values” we mean, in part, actually mining bitcoin in a way that embodies your own ideas about what Bitcoin should become. But we also intend it as a more abstract slogan for unearthing and enacting those values in other ways that sustain and direct the network.      Here are three examples of values that can be extended. We’ll give easy, medium and advanced suggestions under each:    Cypherpunk    Suppose you care about privacy and censorship resistance. Despite prevailing Number Go Up narratives, your fascination with bitcoin derives from the way it empowers individuals rather than institutions. If so, you should take custody of your bitcoin, coinjoin your UTXOs and encourage your family and friends to do the same. Ruthlessly boycott bitcoin platforms or services that punish users for coinjoining and patronize those that respect fungibility. Does this appeal to you? If so:    Easy: Educate yourself on the best practices for self-custody and withdraw any bitcoin you have from custodial platforms. Quit centralized, KYC-AML-compliant lending platforms and use Atomic Finance and the like instead, should you need yield on your holdings.  Medium: Complete your next bitcoin purchases on a peer-to-peer exchange like hodlhodl or Bisq. Install Wasabi or Samurai and coinjoin your bitcoin whenever entering or exiting exchanges.  Advanced: Mine your own KYC-free coin, either by home mining or using a host. Use a pool committed to privacy and fungibility, employing protocols that maximize decentralization.  Environmental    Suppose that, like many bitcoiners, you take a long view of things. You care about the future of our planet. Though media portrayals of bitcoin emissions are sometimes overblown, you are troubled by climate change and would like to see Bitcoin lead the way towards a decarbonized future. If so, you should invest in green bitcoin mining. Mining is a series of contests to win fixed rewards. The more investment that flows into green mining, the less profitable it is to mine with carbon-intensive methods. In principle, enough green mining could simply drive out carbon-intensive mining while also securing the network on which all bitcoiners rely. Here’s what you can do:    Easy: Use exchanges that minimize carbon emissions with offsets. When they become available, purchase Green Co-investment Instruments to invest in green mining proportional to your holdings.  Medium: Buy shares in publicly traded mining firms committed to sustainable methods, like Bitfarms (BITF) or Hive (HIVE).  Advanced: Mine bitcoin yourself using green energy, and join a mining pool with a commitment to clean energy like Terra Pool. If you have access to private equity markets, invest in nascent green mining firms before they go public.  Economic    Suppose you care about preserving value in the face of monetary expansion. You deploy bitcoin not as a get-rich-quick scheme, but as a don’t-get-poor-slowly scheme. If so, you should run a full node, use it to validate transactions and so enforce Bitcoin’s rules, including the all-important supply cap. The plan in action:    Easy: Get a Raspberry Pi or fetch that old laptop out of your closet, turn it into a full node and use it. Upgrade the software judiciously and signal approval only of the network upgrades that preserve decentralization.  Medium: Host a Lightning wallet on your own node. Validate on-chain transactions yourself and use LNbits to bring your friends and family on board without relying on centralized institutional custody.  Advanced: again, consider mining yourself or investing in a mining company committed to decentralization.    These values and proposed implementations won’t necessarily work for everyone. The beauty of self-governance is you are free to express your values, not ours or anyone else's. So here’s an exercise: Write down some of your own most treasured values and then think about how to enact them in your bitcoin strategy, perhaps taking inspiration from our own suggestions above:    I value ______I can promote ______ in bitcoin by doing X.Therefore, I do X.    Some arguments conclude with a theoretical statement. A practical syllogism, by contrast, ends with action. When you run this practical syllogism, what action is its conclusion? How will you help steer the ship?      We are not recommending charity. Mining your values in the ways suggested above is no altruistic giveaway. Green bitcoin mining is profitable. Self-custody protects you from various attacks and counterparty risks. And enforcing Bitcoin’s key economic properties with your own full node is critical to preserving the value of your bitcoin.      There is a price, however, to co-captaining the ship. It requires thought. You have to reflect on, and take responsibility for, what your values truly are and what you’d like bitcoin to become. It requires some self-education.    Read more: Beyond Coinbase: 8 Other Ways to Buy Bitcoin    Every one of these actions is becoming easier – mining, running a node, taking self-custody – but none will ever be as easy as simply clicking “buy” on Coinbase. It requires a minimal amount of research. You have to be mindful when using a product or service of whether it is aligned with your preferred future, or whether you are unwittingly helping to steer the ship in a direction you’d rather not go. The price you pay is the price of citizenship wherever citizens play an actual role in governance.      This price – the unavoidable cost of deliberate and active citizenship – is minimal. But the payout is immense. It is, in short, the intrinsic reward of self-governance, the satisfaction not only of living out your values but of making a difference to our collective monetary future. This is precious. But we admit that it can also be hard to appreciate, so accustomed are we to a voiceless financial existence.      In our monetary system all but a few are mere customers, users making decisions within a system that is simply given to them like the rules of a game. Meanwhile, a priestly caste of central bankers, regulators and policymakers actually shape the rules of that game, the rules of money itself – its issuance rate, its initial distribution, the conditions of its transmittance, lending, etc. Their privilege, of which most of us live our whole lives unaware, remains closely guarded by specialized vocabulary, credentialing and law.      Bitcoin fixes this, we like to say. But one possible future for Bitcoin is that these privileged few, seeing bitcoin as inevitable, use their monetary heft, political power and technical savvy to seize the helm. Block by block and commit by commit, they fashion bitcoin into the image of the existing monetary system, serving the same constituencies. Another possibility is that we don’t let them. Claiming your self-sovereignty and living out your own values could lead to a Bitcoin that collectively reflects the values of its users, rather than the values of nation states, banks or corporations that may try to capture it.    Read more: Why Is Bitcoin Worth Anything at All?    Our argument may remind you of similar pleas to participate in electoral politics. Every four years or so, pundits remind us that every vote matters and that we’re all obliged to do our part. Many bitcoiners will perhaps harbor a few suspicions and take a cynical view of electoral participation altogether. The duty to participate that we’re highlighting isn’t like that. You probably didn’t choose your government; it may well predate your existence and care very little about consent of the governed.      You did choose to be a bitcoiner, and you’re choosing to remain one every day you don’t sell. What we’re urging is that you follow through on those choices in ways that may not be obvious. We’re advocating participation in a collective endeavor that is, at present, still small and where individuals can make a meaningful difference.      It is tempting to think of bitcoin as eliminating the human element in money, of not only disintermediating banks and governments, but people too. Bitcoin, we say, is “just math,” and to many of us that is a comfort. But the temptation to think of bitcoin as code alone must be resisted. Layer 1 is the Bitcoin network.

42387380,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjXV,1627495602,"Federal Reserve Keeps Rates Near Zero, Still Sees Inflation as ‘Transitory’","The U.S. Federal Reserve said Wednesday it would keep interest rates near zero and asset purchases at $120 billion a month.      Earlier in July, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress the central bank is not comfortable with inflation well above 2%, where it is now, but noted the price increases in used vehicles, airline tickets and hotels seem to be temporary.      ""Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors,"" the Fed said in a statement after the conclusion of the two-day, closed-door meeting.      While pressure has been mounting for the central bank to taper its asset purchases, Powell has often reiterated that the bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program advances its commitment to maximum employment.      QE discourages a flight to safety and lowers the yields on risk assets by lowering risk-free yields in other ways, said Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, an initiative focused on understanding financial crises. Encouraging more risky borrowing has a positive effect on employment, Kelly added.      The central bank also announced that it has established two standing repurchase agreement (repo) facilities with a minimum bid rate of 25 basis points, one for primary dealers and additional banks, and another for foreign banks.      “The Fed wants to make sure the Treasury market stays liquid even when the Fed winds down its balance sheet,” Kelly said. “It doesn’t want funding rates to spike in the Treasury market.”      The committee did note the U.S. economy has made progress towards the Fed's goals and that ""the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings."" This could point to tapering in the near future if the economy continues towards the central bank's recovery goals.      “We also reviewed some considerations around how our asset purchases might be adjusted, including their pace and composition once economic conditions warrant a change,” Powell said in a press conference on Wednesday.      In response to a question about what counts as “substantial further progress,” Powell noted there is no single number within maximum employment that the central bank can target as it does with the price stability side of its mandate.      “We monitor a broad range of data about different aspects of the labor market,” Powell said. “We have some ground to cover … I would want to see some strong jobs numbers.” A pullback on economic activity could happen if indoor dining or travel declines significantly because of the more transmissible Delta variant of COVID-19 while the pace of vaccinations slow, Powell added.      “As long as there is time and space for the development of new strains, no one’s really safe,” Powell said. “It is both the right thing to do and in our interest to make sure vaccination happens broadly around the world for that reason.”      The uneven recovery across rich and poor countries could also lead to a decrease in U.S. exports, Powell said.      Powell added that inflation has been running above the central bank’s 2% inflation target for a few months and will continue to run above 2% for a few more months before falling back, but the bank is a “ways away” from raising interest rates.      “It’s not something that’s on our radar screen right now,” he said.      The number of job openings compared to unemployed puts the U.S. on a path to a strong labor market with high participation, Powell added.      “If you have high inflation, you also have high employment, they tend to go together,” Powell said. “This is a situation where they’re temporarily in different directions. We’re not at full employment, but you’re having high inflation. We feel like we’re going to be making good progress over the course of the next year or a couple years towards maximum employment.”      Powell added that workers are looking for new jobs rather than going back to old jobs, which makes the employment process take longer. Other workers are reluctant to go back to work because of COVID-19 fears and because of a lack of child care while schools are not fully open.      “We hear from businesses all over the country that it’s very hard to hire people, and that may be because people are shopping carefully for their next job. But the bottom line on this is people want to work, if you look at where the labor force participation rate is,” Powell said.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/28/federal-reserve-keeps-rates-near-zero-still-sees-inflation-as-transitory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ec0e31ef39662feee8253fd18be6e3fcba41002-1300x817.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the time of writing, BTC trades at $36,621 with a 3.2% profit in the daily and a 31.9% in the weekly chart. The sentiment is growing bullish, as Bitcoin continues to tackle the important resistance at key levels. In addition, data from CryptoQuant points towards bullish indicators. Despite an increase in BTC inflows to exchange platforms, most of the selling seems to be absorbed by strong buyers. As a consequence, the Bitcoin spot reserves on exchanges are on a downtrend, as the chart below shows. CryptoQuant claims that this is the &apos;highest outflow level&apos; since Bitcoin has been testing the lows of its current range, around $29,000, and the high levels at $40,000. Therefore, it is possible to assume that BTC&apos;s price could find enough support for a fresh leg-up into previous highs. On the first pullback after breaking through $30,000 earlier in the year, there was the same peak in outflow volume on the exchanges. We need to see as price breaks new resistance up to the last historial top (…) This data also suggests that the price could reclaim the previous high without &apos;great demand&apos;, CryptoQuant said.

42387385,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjhZ,1627494529,Israeli Bill Would Force Crypto Investors to Report Holdings Above $61K,"UPDATE (AUG. 25, 14:10 UTC): The proposed crypto regulations were among the 30% of the bill cut before its first reading in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, because the draft was too large to be debated within the time constraints allowed.      Israel’s Ministry of Finance published a draft law on Tuesday that would require investors to report crypto holdings exceeding 200,000 new Israeli shekels (around $61,000) to tax authorities.      The new requirement is included in a draft of the Arrangements Law – a bill containing upcoming amendments to economic policy that is submitted to parliament alongside the annual budget.      Israeli financial authorities are not alone in implementing reporting requirements for crypto investors, although the burden is typically placed on virtual currency service providers, not the investors themselves. For example, in July, Taiwan put into effect new anti-money laundering (AML) regulations requiring crypto platforms to report transactions exceeding $18,000 to the bureau of investigation.      According to a section in Israel's proposed bill dedicated to the “increased supervision” of virtual currencies, the reporting requirement is intended to optimize tax collection from their use. If the bill is approved, investors who purchase virtual currencies directly or through someone older than 18 will have to report all holdings worth 200,000 new Israeli shekels (NIS) or more if the assets were held for at least one day.      The Israeli Bitcoin Association (IBA) and other crypto advocates oppose the bill.      “The Israeli crypto community as a whole is astounded by this news and is hopeful regulators can come to their senses and work with local blockchain entrepreneurs and users in order to do this the right way,” said Ben Samocha, founder of Israeli crypto community CryptoTalks and crypto learning platform CryptoJungle.      The proposed amendment follows the Israel central bank’s testing a digital shekel. Tuesday’s draft bill also contained penalties for the use of cash as financial authorities attempt to stamp out Israel’s “black economy.”      According to the draft bill, the Israeli Tax Authority (ITA) has proposed the amendment on reporting crypto holdings to reduce Israel’s volume of “black capital” and to expose unreported assets and income.      Samocha said that while he understands the regulators’ desire to track malicious activities like money laundering and terror financing, that does not mean Israeli bitcoin holders must be treated “like criminals” first.      Nir Hirshman, head of regulation at IBA, told CoinDesk via a written statement that as soon as the association saw the draft bill, it contacted senior officials at the ITA.      “[They] were very attentive, open and willing to consider changes [to] their proposal,” Hirshman said.      The letter from the IBA, shared with CoinDesk, was addressed to Eran Yaakov, the head of Israel’s tax authority. It explained why the association is opposed to the reporting requirement, starting with the claim that such reporting requirements do not exist for other assets and that such a requirement discriminates against digital currency holders. In 2018, the central bank of Israel declared that digital currencies are assets, not currencies.      The letter also said that the reporting obligations will infringe on crypto holders’ privacy, and because reporting would lead to the creation of a database of investors, that if leaked, could threaten their security.      ""This is a bad proposal that will harm bitcoin investors and won't add even one dollar to tax collection in Israel,” Hirshman said. “We believe that the demand to report crypto assets holdings in fiat terms will accidently turn normative law abiding citizens to tax offenders, just because they missed a spike in one of their assets holdings.""      The draft is open for public comment until July 31, and Hirshman hopes that Israel’s bitcoin community will succeed in changing the bill.      “We still have time, and I hope that ours, and other members of the bitcoin community's efforts to convince the ITA that this is a bad idea will be fruitful and this regulation will not be advanced,” Hirshman said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/28/israeli-bill-would-force-crypto-investors-to-report-holdings-above-61k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41559f7d6f9cc5869b5ada95df03c1361bfbcc34-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387386,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjgJ,1627492853,Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Discount Narrows as 'Unlocks' Pass,"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares have narrowed their discount relative to the underlying cryptocurrency held in the fund – possibly a sign that buyers are using the vehicle to bet on the recent recovery rally in digital-asset markets.      The GBTC shares traded at a discount of 6.6% to net asset value (NAV) on Tuesday, the smallest margin since June 22, based on data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The discount had widened to 15% in mid-June.      “The discount seems to have narrowed due to a surge in buying interest in GBTC following weekend’s bitcoin price rally,” Rahul Rai, co-head of Market Neutral at BlockTower Capital, said.      Bitcoin crossed above the critical 50-day average resistance level at $35,000 over the weekend and climbed past $40,000 on Monday. At press time, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at around $40,200, up for an eighth straight day in its longest winning streak since December.      Some investors may have snapped up GBTC shares in hopes that the discount will evaporate with a bull revival in bitcoin. In that scenario, the buyers would reap any price gains on bitcoin while pocketing extra profit from a narrowing of the discount. (Grayscale Investments, which manages the trust, is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)    Read more: Why Stablecoins Are Suddenly in the News    “The GBTC discount could be narrowing from investors increasing purchases of GBTC for their tax-advantaged accounts on the belief that BTC will continue to rise with the recent run in price,” Martin Gaspar, research analyst at CrossTower, said.            Under the rules of the Grayscale trust, accredited investors – typically institutions or rich people – can buy GBTC shares at net asset value by depositing bitcoin or U.S. dollars into the trust and agreeing to hold the shares for at least six months. There was a strong incentive to do so last year and into early 2021, because the shares consistently traded at a premium; investors would lock up bitcoin, get GBTC and liquidate shares at the premium six months later, pocketing extra profit. The trust witnessed record inflows in the December-January period as the premium swelled to 40%.      The shares, however, fell into discount in early February, taking the shine off what was known as the Grayscale carry trade. Inflows into the trust have since dried up and the trust won’t be releasing any shares over coming months. That could be another reason for the narrowing of the discount.      “The main factor is the fact that we don't have any unlocks occurring in the foreseeable future,” Vetle Lund, an analyst at Arcane Research, said. “Over the last months, massive unlocks have occurred, leading to constant and massive selling pressure of GBTC shares.”            The trust unlocked some 40,000 shares in July. That represents potential selling pressure, because investors have an option to liquidate holdings in the secondary market. However, that selling pressure no longer exists; data from the firm Bybt shows there are no more unlockings at least until early 2022.      Existing GBTC investors may be holding on to their shares – reducing selling pressure from the market – while new investors may be snapping up shares at the discount in hopes that the trust will be converted into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the future. Such a conversion might cause the shares to trade more regularly in line with the value of the trust's bitcoin.      “There may also be speculators buying GBTC in the hopes of profiting off the discount if GBTC is able to convert into an ETF,” CrossTower’s Gaspar said.      Grayscale Investments said in April it was committed to converting the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The world’s largest digital-assets manager recently hired the New York-based bank BNY Mellon to handle accounting and administrative services for GBTC starting in October. The trust said the relationship will eventually morph into transfer agent and ETF services provider for the GBTC ETF, when and if that is approved by regulators.

Prime Trust provides payment, settlement, know-your-customer and liquidity APIs that Vicuna said covers “the full infrastructure stack” for fintechs like neo-banks and crypto exchanges.  The round was led by Mercato Partners’ growth equity fund, Traverse. Nationwide, Samsung Next, Kraken Ventures and Seven Peaks Ventures also participated, with Seven Peaks’ Tom Gonser and Mercato’s Zane Busteed joining Prime Trust’s board.  Nevada-based Prime Trust’s Series A comes as crypto companies of all stripes race for a claim of frenzied venture capital. Startups are scaling while money is cheap under the belief that demand for their services will, with crypto, only grow.

Both Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, as reported by CoinDesk last week, have also been offering the clearing and settlement of cryptocurrency ETPs for hedge funds, as financial institutions continue to make tentative steps toward the adoption of crypto. Banks are keen to avoid missing out on a potentially lucrative revenue stream as more clients seek access to the sector.      Bank of America has also approved the trading of bitcoin futures for some clients and is clearing cash-settled contracts.    Read more: Bank of America Approves Bitcoin Futures Trading for Some Clients: Source    For UBS, the latest development comes despite the company’s stated caution regarding crypto. In a recent note to clients UBS raised concerns over the nature of crypto markets and recent regulatory developments.      “Regulators have demonstrated they can and will crack down on crypto,” UBS said in a report. “We suggest investors stay clear and build their portfolio around less risky assets.”      The warning followed prior reports that the lender was in the early stages of exploring ways of offering crypto to wealthier clients.      Obviously, these concerns haven’t prevented some UBS clients from wanting to get in on the action or deterred UBS from considering obliging them.      A UBS spokesperson declined to comment.

42387418,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjip,1627480800,Luxor Technologies Launches Index of Crypto Mining Stocks,"Luxor Technologies on Wednesday has rolled out a mining stock index that the crypto mining firm said will help quantify the industry's health on the public markets.      The new index product, which appears on Luxor’s “Hashrate Index,” features 50 publicly traded companies with a stake in the mining game. Miners themselves are heavily represented, but some tech-related companies such as SBI Holdings and Galaxy Digital are also in the mix.      Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera told CoinDesk the “Crypto Miner Stock Index” comes as more mining companies go public. Publicly traded mining companies now power over 15% of the bitcoin network’s hashrate, he said.      He said the index “provides miners, investors and the public a gauge on how investors are looking at the space and the sentiment in mining.” The index will be updated quarterly.      The investment world has been chasing mining exposure in recent months amid a wider shakeup in the sector. Last week, Viridi Funds unveiled an exchange-traded fund for bitcoin mining firms going green. That vehicle is to be 80% in green miners and 20% in semiconductor companies.      Public pensions are also getting in on bitcoin mining stocks as an arm's-length investment in the crypto economy.    Read more: New Jersey Pension Invested $7M in Bitcoin Mining Stocks Last Quarter    For its part, Luxor’s index will be a mix of pure-play mining firms and the companies supporting them. Ten percent of the initial index is earmarked for chip manufacturers, 5% for foundries and the remaining 85% for the miners themselves.      Diversified crypto companies with a stake in the mining business get 50% less weighted power, according to a press release.      “Bitcoin mining valuations are a high beta play on bitcoin,” Vera said. “If the underlying commodity moves a few percent, the valuations move some multiple of that. These valuations give investors torque on the underlying commodity.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/28/luxor-technologies-launches-index-of-crypto-mining-stocks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f0fcfffa48735721c20705499c857ca527ac80e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Biconomy announced Wednesday that it has raised $9 million in a funding round led by Mechanism Capital, with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Huobi Innovation Labs, CoinFund and other crypto investment firms.      The platform’s blockchain-agnostic network, which includes software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs), is designed to help developers build decentralized apps (dapps) that are simpler and more user friendly.      According to Biconomy CEO Ahmed Al-Balaghi, the steps required to interact with dapps – creating a crypto wallet, purchasing and transferring tokens, and managing gas fees – is enough to put off many first-timers.    Read more: Biconomy Raises $1.5M in Seed Funding for Bid to Simplify Blockchain Transactions    Biconomy’s goal, Al-Balaghi says, is to make dapps more user friendly by removing the “friction points” that end users find frustrating, which in turn increases user retention and helps bring new users into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.      Since its launch in 2019, Biconomy has processed more than 3.6 million transactions and currently has more than 200 dapp integrations in the pipeline. Al-Balaghi said Biconomy has seen three major categories arise in its dapp portfolio, including decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) applications.      Biconomy will use some of the funds to decentralize its relayer network, including preparing for the launch of its native token, BICO.

CoinDesk spoke to several industry figures and asked them what they thought about the outlook for crypto markets given some of these recent headwinds.      Here is what they said:    Ryan Moore, CEO of bitcoin mobile app Mode  What we’re starting to see is the inevitable, and necessary, meeting of global regulators with industry players. This will only continue as investor interest builds, which is happening fast. The incumbents need to show that they're being responsible and prioritizing consumer protections, and so do we.Yes, there have been price fluctuations, but without doubt, I'm still bullish on bitcoin. Bitcoin has proved its position as a store of value, and this will only be entrenched by Millennial and Gen Z investors. It’s scarcity, durability and security means that, by both fiat and cryptocurrency standards, it has long-term utility and value. A few years ago Bitcoin was compared to the internet in the early ‘90s. This comparison still stands; the internet became ubiquitous and Bitcoin will too.Engaging with regulation doesn’t preclude innovation or disruption. In fact, this will enable the industry to grow. An increase in security and transparency goes hand in hand with an increase in investor confidence – both institutional and retail. We’re seeing investors seek out this assurance more and more. Ultimately, the added scrutiny we’ve seen in recent months is good for crypto.  Richard Byworth, CEO of crypto financial services company EQONEX  We remain bullish for the remainder of the year. The mining crackdown in China has impacted the price heavily as miners migrate and hash power has dropped, but longer term, this is bullish and will make Bitcoin more resilient. We are still forecasting BTC to be around $175,000 at the peak of the current cycle into 2022.The regulatory scrutiny of the industry at present will also lead to longer-term frameworks being put in place and regulatory-focused players like ourselves providing on ramps for institutions. Our road map for the rest of the year is focused on derivative product rollout, a core requirement for the majority of institutions that will lead to reduced volatility and even further adoption.  Steve Ehrlich, CEO of digital-asset broker Voyager Digital  After a period of trading in range, I believe that bitcoin and crypto will increase substantially by year end. My price prediction is that bitcoin will approach $100,000 by Dec. 31, 2021. The continued adoption of cryptocurrency will continue to accelerate through the year.  Peter Wall, CEO of bitcoin mining firm Argo Blockchain  I don't get worried about short-term fluctuations in the bitcoin price. As a company, we’re thinking longer term – in quarters and years, not days and weeks. If you look back and consider the trends we’ve seen over the last six to 12 months, and especially over the last five to 10 years, the digital-asset ecosystem is clearly moving in one direction. We believe it's still early days, and the digital-asset ecosystem will continue to disrupt traditional players and is the future of money and finance. The narrative over the last six to 12 months has been of large-scale institutions adopting positions in cryptocurrencies, and while we have seen companies such as MicroStrategy, PayPal and Tesla do so, there will be many more to come.I think it is easy to forget that large institutions are like aircraft carriers, and to change their direction takes a huge amount of effort, and most importantly, a significant amount of time. We believe that these adjustments are underway, and the industry will feel the full effect of these changes in the coming months and years.  Frank Schuil, CEO of crypto exchange Safello  China’s clampdown on mining has been priced in and the road ahead is bright. It opens up the market for other geographies to flourish. Miners will move to regulatory environments that are more favorable to crypto with less competition from a historically dominant China. On the regulatory side itself, things look better than ever, at least in Europe. The ability for crypto companies to passport their registrations once MiCA is introduced will accelerate competitiveness and adoption.

42434935,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuWrh,1627471800,Ethereum Devs Grapple With Worst-Case Scenarios,"This week, I'll discuss the fallout from last Wednesday’s test network issues that revealed a bug in Ethereum’s majority software client, Geth. Though a patched version of Geth software has since been released for London, some users, developers and mining pools are calling for further testing of the upgrade, which is scheduled to go live next week.    This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Pulse check    The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.      Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.    New frontiers    As Ethereum prepares for the activation of its 11th backward-incompatible upgrade, also called a “hard fork,” on Wednesday, Aug. 4, some developers are concerned that the upgrade could use more testing before deployment.      Shortly following the biweekly Ethereum core developers meeting on Friday, July 23, Ethereum Foundation’s Tim Beiko wrote in the All Core Developers Discord chatroom, “A couple people have reached out or tweeted about not necessarily being happy with not delaying [the hard fork] … I asked about this [in the meeting] and no one seemed to have a strong opinion, but some folks mentioned this maybe wasn’t the right approach.”      In response to Beiko’s comment, Ethereum software client developer Alexey Akhunov said he agreed it was “strange” there wasn’t more discussion in the biweekly meeting about potentially delaying the hard fork, dubbed “London,” in light of recent events.      “I suppose I know why,” wrote Akhunov. “Delaying [London] is a sensitive topic and no one wants to take the heat, understandable.”      Others in the chatroom chimed in imploring Ethereum developers to give serious consideration to delaying London a few more weeks for further testing.    The backstory    Concerns over the risks of the London upgrade – which includes a controversial code change impacting the fee market of Ethereum known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 – grew after a bug was discovered in Ethereum software client Geth.      For background, Geth is the most popular software used to connect to Ethereum. According to Ethernodes.org, an estimated 86% of all computers, also called nodes, synced to the Ethereum network run Geth client software.      On Wednesday, July 21, the Ethereum test network Ropsten, which activated the London hard fork a month ago, suddenly experienced a chain split after an invalid transaction was mined into a block by nodes running Geth while being rejected by nodes running minority clients Besu and Open Ethereum.      Within a few hours, a hot fix was released by the Geth team and all users were encouraged to update their software to the latest version number, Terra Nova 1.10.6.    The solution    While no developers argued that the bug should delay main network activation of London during Friday’s call, some developers did discuss the appropriate course of action if such a bug were discovered on Ethereum rather than on a test network.      “What would we do if something like this happened on mainnet, especially in a spot where say Geth, the majority client, they’re producing blocks? It obviously takes several hours to have a fix out,” said Beiko during the meeting.      Ethereum Foundation’s Martin Holst Swende stressed that these bugs are not unprecedented occurrences on Ropsten, and while they’re “a pain in the ass” to resolve, there are two ways to address them.      First, if a user’s node is following the wrong version of the blockchain, the user will need to internally “rewind the chain” back to the block before the chain split and sync to the new chain using patched Geth software. Second, if a user’s node isn’t already synced to a version of the blockchain but is trying to connect to the network to gather data about recent transactions or execute transactions, the user may end up connecting to the wrong version of the chain. To avoid this, these users will need to “whitelist” certain nodes on Ethereum that are following the correct chain and isolate from others that are stuck on the wrong chain.    The fallout    Both rewinding and whitelisting Ethereum nodes can be done through Geth. Miners on Ropsten were able to resolve the chain split that took place last Wednesday using these tactics, though one miner noted during Friday’s meeting that instructions for repairing chain splits were not effectively communicated before Wednesday’s incident and accordingly left many miners confused as to how to restart their nodes correctly.      User “AlexSSD7” wrote in the Discord chatroom that as the representative of an Ethereum mining pool, they were “worried” about the bug in Geth, noting, “A single minute [of network] downtime costs us a lot. One hour of downtime is $20,000 to us.”      Unexpected bugs in client software would indeed be disruptive to exchanges and businesses operating on the main network, which is why developers stressed the need for a robust monitoring system that could quickly alert node operators of chain splits and encourage them to pause operations until further investigation.      “This seems like a pretty low-hanging fruit that provides a tone of value to the ecosystem. If you’re not sure how to get started, just ask in the Discord,” said Beiko in Friday’s meeting.      While these solutions would certainly be helpful if a bug similar to what occurred on Wednesday were to happen again after deployment of London on mainnet, they wouldn’t necessarily be the same solutions used to address larger-scale issues, such as the event of a hacker magically printing 100 million ETH.      In the event of something so catastrophic, Ethereum Foundation’s Danny Ryan said in Friday’s meeting that it would be difficult to know in advance how developers would proceed.      “I think there are just many options for the many types of bugs and many types of peculiarities that will emerge,” said Ryan.      The more severe the impacts of a network bug are, the more intrusive the solution to resolving the bug will likely be – and the more damaging to Ethereum’s reputation as a secure blockchain.      With increasingly ambitious hard forks in the near-term horizon on Ethereum’s development roadmap, figuring out potential solutions to a worst-case scenario and plans for damage control with network stakeholders may soon become an imperative for developers to consider.    Validated takes – EthCC Edition    The following is a special edition of Validated Takes highlighting a handful of panel discussions and keynote presentations from last week’s Ethereum community conference in Paris, France. For the full conference agenda, check out the official EthCC website.      “DeFi for Traditional Markets: When Security Tokens,” Talk by Fountain co-founder Mathieu Chanson. Highlights: Fountain is a decentralized exchange on Ethereum that enables users to buy and sell security tokens. Chanson highlighted the liquidity and accessibility that blockchain technology offers, being accessible 24 hours a day and allowing for immediate settlement. There are several other benefits to tokenizing securities, including transparency and fractionalization of assets that further increase accessibility. However, there are plenty of challenges with creating a fully decentralized securities exchange. Onboarding customers and new securities will both require following international regulations, including Know Your Customer laws and custody licenses.      “The Power of Credit Delegation,” Talk by Aave founder Stani Kulechov. Highlights: Aave is a decentralized lending protocol built on Ethereum. The team behind the protocol has built a product that can provide zero-collateral loans. Kulechov believes this is a step forward in bringing DeFi liquidity into the real economy and driving up borrowing demand on Aave.      “Things that Matter Outside of DeFi,” Talk by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.

Buterin argues the network’s token economy and censorship resistance are two reasons why these activities could benefit from being built atop a decentralized blockchain.      “Uniswap, DeFi & the Future of Consumer Finance,” Talk by Uniswap growth lead Ashleigh Schap.

42434932,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuWph,1627470413,XRP Cheers Ripple's Japan-Philippines Corridor as Bitcoin Breaks Above $40K Ahead of Fed,"XRP, a cryptocurrency used by Ripple in its payments network, rallied to a five-week high on Wednesday after the company said it is targeting the $1.8 billion Filipino Remittance Corridor.      The cryptocurrency changed hands at $0.74 during the European hours, hitting the highest level since June 21 and representing a 13% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Buyers stepped in around $0.65 after Ripple announced that Japan's money-transfer provider SBI Remit, Philippines mobile-payments service Coins.ph and crypto exchange SBI VC Trade have teamed up to carry remittance payments from Japan to the Philippines using Ripple's on-demand liquidity (ODL) service.      Filipinos based in Japan send almost $2 billion to their home country every year. According to Ripple, it's a costly affair because Japan has one of the highest remittance costs in the world. ""It's almost twice as much as the average of all the G-8 countries,"" Ripple noted.      ODL uses Ripple's xRapid cross-border payment service and allows customers to transfer funds using XRP, making transactions relatively faster and cheaper.      ""This is Ripple's first On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service implementation in Japan, setting the stage to drive more adoption of crypto-enabled services in the region,"" Ripple said. ""By leveraging the digital asset XRP to eliminate pre-funding, the two companies can also free up capital and accelerate the expansion of their own payments businesses.""      The news comes on the heels of a long-standing battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that weighed heavily on XRP at the end of the last year.      In December, the SEC filed a case against Ripple for raising $1.3 billion by selling XRP in unregistered securities offerings. XRP fell by 67% to $0.21 in December before rallying to $1.9 in April this year amid the broader market bull frenzy. However, when bitcoin took a big hit in May, that also punctured the bull run in XRP and other coins. XRP recently hit lows near $0.50.      Bitcoin is trading above $40,000 at press time, up 1.72% on the day. Sentiment has recently flipped in favor of the bulls, and some investors have been snapping up calls, or bullish bets, in anticipation of continued upside. Stronger gains could be in the offing as the Federal Reserve (Fed) is unlikely to bolster concerns of early unwinding, or tapering, of its stimulus program later today.      Also read: Ripple On-Demand Liquidity Corridor Opens Between Japan and Philippines      ""Policymakers will likely continue to warn over the recent move higher in U.S. inflation, which last month jumped to fresh multiyear highs,"" Matt Ryan, a senior market analyst at Ebury, said. ""The committee will, however, also probably highlight the downside risks to growth posed by the latest wave of virus infection triggered by the aggressive spread of the delta variant.""      Ryan doesn't foresee a formal announcement on QE tapering until the September meeting, when fresh macroeconomic and interest rate projections will be released. Bitcoin will likely face selling pressure if the Fed's monetary policy statement drops hints of an early taper.",POSITIVE,XRP,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/28/xrp-cheers-ripples-japan-philippines-corridor-as-bitcoin-breaks-above-40k-ahead-of-fed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c29cfa722a6798c638af4e4d7b4022866bfa435f-1300x865.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether's trading volume totaled $1.4 trillion in the January-to-June period, a 1,461% rise from $92 billion observed in first-half 2020.  Trading volumes in bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, rose 489% to $2.1 trillion during the same period.  Ether also outshone bitcoin, the S&P 500 and gold in price performance, rallying 210% over the six months ended June 30. Bitcoin rose 20%, the S&P 500 gained 14% and gold fell 6.7%.  ""Many of our largest institutional clients, including hedge funds, endowments, and corporates, increased or added first-time exposure to ETH in H1, believing the asset has long-term staying power tantamount to BTC's, while playing a differentiated role in their portfolios,"" Coinbase's report said.  The report cited the explosive growth of Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi), optimism that Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism will turn ether into a yielding asset and the deflationary impact of the EIP-1559 upgrade as reasons for ether's price rally.  The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559 upgrade scheduled for Aug. 4 will activate a mechanism to take a variable amount of ETH out of circulation each time a transaction is executed. That will curb supply growth and may give ether a store-of-value-like appeal.
