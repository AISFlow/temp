13991637,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538586,1687215638,Ethereum Eyes Dramatic Shift: Proposes Validator Limit Increase From 32 To 2048 ETH,"Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, could be on the cusp of a significant operational shift. In the latest Ethereum core developer consensus meeting, a key agenda item under discussion was a proposed increase in the maximum validator limit. If implemented, this adjustment would see the limit skyrocket from the current 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH per validator. Currently, validators in Ethereum’s network maintain a balance cap set at both the minimum and maximum of 32 ETH. Those managing large-scale staking operations, consequently, must establish multiple validators to earn yield beyond this limit. As such, the result is a significant growth in the number of validators, with the current count reaching 600,000 active validators and an additional 90,000 on standby. Streamlining For Optimization Michael Neuder, an Ethereum Foundation researcher and a primary advocate of this change, argues that the proposed increase would alleviate the pressures caused by the expanding validator set size. Related Reading: Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: Why Arbitrum, Optimism Will Profit Massively Neuder highlighted that the current validator cap does support decentralization, but it simultaneously leads to an inflation of the validator set size. This increasing size eventually enhances the system’s performance by expediting the conclusion within a solitary Ethereum slot. In addition, Neuder pointed out the prospect of auto-compounding validator rewards brought on by this change. Given the current restrictions, any rewards earned beyond the 32 ETH cap must be averted to other places to generate any staking yield. With a raised cap, these rewards could be compounded instantaneously, enabling validators to reap greater benefits from their staked ETH. Impact On Large-Scale Operators And Associated Risks The proposal also aims to address the procedural challenges encountered by major node managers, such as exchanges like Coinbase, that presently supervise multitudes of validators due to the standing 32 ETH constraint per validator. If the cap were to be elevated, such operators could manage fewer validators with higher stakes, which could potentially simplify operations. However, Neuder cautioned about the risks tied to this proposed change. For instance, the increase could potentially lead to steeper penalties for inadvertent double attestations or proposals, also known as “slashing.” This highlights the importance of considering all possible implications in the path toward improving network efficiency and validator rewards. Notably, as Ethereum continues to evolve, this potential change in the validator limit serves as a critical discussion point in the broader conversation about the platform’s future.

The downward pressure has the altcoin at risk of forming a death cross on the daily timeframe. Although the signal sounds ominous and often indicates a downtrend is coming, it might not be lights out for LTC after all. Let’s take a look. Lackluster Litecoin Performance Ahead of Halving Attributed to SEC With Litecoin’s halving just weeks away, the currently eleventh-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap was expected to perform better than it has. Fundamental and technical signals both point to LTC being undervalued, yet the coin has suffered alongside other altcoins from SEC-related sell pressure. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Could Be Gearing Up For Its Greatest Rally Since 2017 The US SEC is trying to kill the crypto industry, and its causing LTCUSD daily charts to inch closer to an ominous death cross. Its this a valid breakout of the downtrend line? | LTCUSD on TradingView.com Doing A Double-Take On The Daily LTCUSD Death Cross A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average from above. This is considered a sell signal in a moving average-based trading system, and often precedes a negative trend change. But not always. A closer look at the 2020 death cross into golden cross | LTCUSD on TradingView.com The chart above shows an example of a previous death cross from late 2020, which immediately rolled into a golden cross as soon as Litecoin found some support and started rising again. LTCUSD went on a massive rally lasting several weeks of upside. For this situation to repeat, Litecoin absolutely has to recover from current levels and resume its formerly bullish momentum. Otherwise, a death cross could lead to renewed selling from investors who expected more out of the halving. Related Reading: Litecoin Attempts To Revitalize The Crypto Market With Bullish Breakout Death cross and golden crosses can sometimes trigger back and forth in a choppy market, which is a drawback of using moving averages as trading signals. This is due to volatile price action pulling the faster moving average back and forth through the slower moving average. Furthermore, as an average of price action, moving averages are lagging indicators in general. A golden cross must be left on the chart when the all the consolidation ends, otherwise the looming death cross signal could have truly deadly implications. With Litecoin’s halving scheduled for under 45 days from now, anything is possible. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter. Follow @TonyTheBullBTC & @coinchartist_io on Twitter.

The recovery of this price mark on June 15th has given BTC holders renewed confidence, with the highly anticipated news of Blackrock, the largest fund manager in the world with over $10 trillion under its management, announcing a formal application for a new spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has further boosted their optimism. Despite this positive news, Bitcoin still faces significant resistance ahead if it is to recover previously lost territories and solidify a bull run. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Already Bottomed, Sets Halving Price Higher Low At $25,800 Before Upside Breakout? Crypto analyst WoeToe has recently shared his thoughts on the current state of the Bitcoin market, highlighting a crucial level that bulls should keep an eye on. According to WoeToe, Bitcoin has failed to break its resistance level at $26,600, indicating that the market may be experiencing a period of consolidation before making its next move. WoeToe believes that BTC may set a higher low around the $25,800 level before breaking out of its current channel to the upside, as indicated by the yellow lines on the chart. This means that if Bitcoin were to drop to $25,800, it would be a critical level for bulls to defend to maintain bullish momentum. Therefore, bulls must hold the $25,800 mark and prevent a drop below it. If Bitcoin successfully sets a higher low at this level and breaks out of its current channel, it could potentially open up new resistance levels and lead to a bullish trend in the market. However, if bulls fail to defend the potential higher low at $25,800, Bitcoin could experience a further downtrend. In this scenario, the cryptocurrency may test its strongest support floor, indicated by its 200-day Moving Average (MA), currently at $25,200. The 200-day MA has previously prevented Bitcoin from extending its downtrend since last week’s weekly opening. Bitcoin Downside Risk Increases Cryptocurrency trader Rekt Capital has warned Bitcoin investors, stating that the leading cryptocurrency has rallied straight into the 200-week Moving Average, which could act as new resistance and potentially trigger a two-step breakdown confirmation. This, in turn, could lead to further downside for Bitcoin shortly. The 200-week MA is a widely-watched technical indicator that reflects the average price of Bitcoin over the past 200 weeks. It is considered a significant support level and has historically acted as a key price point for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Stablecoins Supply Finally Shows Rise, Here’s Why This Is Bullish For Bitcoin However, if BCT fails to break through the 200-week MA and instead turns it into new resistance, it could lead to a two-step breakdown confirmation. This would mean that the cryptocurrency would break through two key support levels quickly, potentially signaling a significant shift in market sentiment and leading to further downside. Bitcoin has made multiple attempts to break through the $26,600 resistance level but has been unsuccessful. The cryptocurrency is trading at $26,400 and has yet to surpass the critical resistance mark.

NWT is the native token of the Ninja Warriors Meta gaming platform. Ninja Warriors Meta's Presale In line with the project's roadmap, the NWT presale is already underway before the full launch of Ninja Warrior Meta's blockchain gaming platform. The NWT token is the native token and core of the Ninja Warrior Meta ecosystem. Thus, the presale allows gamers to acquire NWT tokens at a discounted price before the general publicif they intend to fully participate in the full game mode upon launch at the end of 2023. The minimum investment amount is 100 USDT, while whales can only buy a maximum of 100,000 USDT. All investors must submit personal details as part of the know-your-customer (KYC) procedure. It would also allow gamers and investors to enjoy a share in future developments, enhanced gameplay, immersive game modes, rewards, and an expanded gaming ecosystem. The roadmap showcases a clear vision for exponential growth, and the team behind Ninja Warriors Meta is committed to continuous development and strategic partnerships with industry leaders. To fund the project's roadmap and ensure widespread adoption and awareness, the NWT presale allows Ninja Warrior Meta to run a dedicated branding phase utilizing organic traffic generation on social media platforms. The focus would be expanding the Ninja Warrior Meta community, including captivating press releases, team interviews, and strategic campaigns. The presale goes beyond promoting the Ninja Warrior Meta blockchain game through engaging storytelling and content like videos and gameplay showcases. Notably, it facilitates gathering like-minded crypto game participants, influential figures, and investors, immersing them in Ninja Warriors Meta. Moreover, Ninja Warriors Meta is set to release a move-to-earn (M2E) application for Android and iOS platforms in two months. This application offers users the opportunity to accumulate points through physical activities, including gym visits and diverse movements. These points can be exchanged for DBUSD tokens. Full-game Launch Amid the ongoing NWT presale, since Q3 2022, gaming enthusiasts have been eagerly awaiting the announcement of Ninja Warriors Meta's full-game platform.

Players that obtain a low-cost monthly subscription are set to receive a free non-fungible token (NFT) character that allows its owner to enter the Ninja Warrior Meta ecosystem and start playing, earning, and progressing. Since the Ninja Warrior Meta game would launch on Polygon's layer-2 blockchain, players would also need to set up a MATIC-compatible wallet and fund said wallet with sufficient MATIC for transaction gas fees. Players would also expect to earn as they play, covering whatever initial costs were incurred during gameplay. For that reason, Ninja Warriors Meta incorporates an in-game rewards system designed to be fair and sustainable. Conclusion The presale launch would position Ninja Warrior Meta as a worthy player in the blockchain gaming industry by funding its growth, continuous development, and strategic partnerships necessary for the game to flourish. With its focus on blockchain technology and the potential of play-to-earn gaming, Ninja Warriors Meta's full-game launch would captivate individuals, enticing them to join the revolutionary blockchain gaming experience.

Data shows a Bitcoin whale has withdrawn $395.8 million from Binance to an unknown wallet, a sign that may be bullish for the cryptocurrency’s price. Massive Bitcoin Transaction Spotted on the Blockchain According to the data provided by Whale Alert, a cryptocurrency transaction tracker, a whale recently transferred 15,000 BTC away from Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. At the current market price, these Bitcoins are worth around $395.878 million. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 15,000 #BTC (395,878,446 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallethttps://t.co/PyhE6gBozq — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) June 19, 2023 Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Already Bottomed, Sets Halving Price This is one of the largest single transactions involving Bitcoin that has been reported so far this year. Although the recipient address is unknown, the amount of the transaction suggests that it was likely an institutional investor or high net worth individual also known as a “whale” who wanted complete control of their digital assets. How Self-Custody Is Good For The Price Of Bitcoin It is no new revelation that when dealing with digital assets, self-custody is the best way, especially on a large scale. By transferring from an exchange wallet into a private wallet, the whale now has sole control and responsibility over the private keys that can move the funds. For many long term holders, this is a safer option than keeping large amounts of crypto on an exchange which could be at higher risk of hacks or scams. BTC recovers above $26,000 resistance | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com When whales make significant transactions, it can frequently cause price volatility. If this whale plans to hold their BTC long-term, it could signal confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. On the other hand, if they were to sell a significant percentage of it, there would be an oversupply on the market, which would bring the price down, at least temporarily. Related Reading: Trust Wallet Token (TWT) Tallies 22% In Last Week, Will It Test $1 Mark? Also, when big players move their BTC off exchanges into self-custody wallets, it’s usually a good sign for Bitcoin’s price. Removing hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin from exchanges means less supply available for trading. This increases scarcity on exchanges, thereby increasing the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is now trading above $26,000 after breaking the $26,000 resistance during the weekend. With the next Bitcoin halving less than a year away, whales moving their assets into self-custody may send some ripples of bullish sentiment into the wider crypto industry.

13985169,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538550,1687201211,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Still Bullish, Will Rally Restart?","On-chain data shows that Bitcoin short-term holders have participated in buying recently despite the price briefly dropping below their cost basis. Bitcoin Has Rebounded Back Above Short-Term Holder Realized Price As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC price had recently fallen below the realized price of the short-term holders. The “realized price” here refers to a metric that’s derived from the “realized cap.” The realized cap is a popular capitalization model for Bitcoin that assumes that the true value of each coin in circulation is not the current spot price, but the price at which it was last moved/sold on the blockchain. When this cap is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the “realized price” emerges. The significance of this indicator is that it represents the cost basis of the average investor in the market. In the context of the current discussion, the average acquisition price of the entire market isn’t of interest, however; the realized price for only a segment of the market is relevant: the short-term holders. The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to investors who bought their coins less than 155 days ago. These investors are generally fickle and their behavior has historically been relevant to the trend BTC has followed. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH realized price over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been near the spot price recently | Source: CryptoQuant The STH realized price has historically displayed some interesting interactions with the spot price of Bitcoin. During bearish periods, the metric has provided resistance to the price, while in bullish trends, it has switched its role to being a support level. Both these patterns are also visible in the above graph, where the cryptocurrency saw a negative reaction to the line around the time of the November 2022 FTX collapse, while it found support at it when the rally had taken a step back in March 2023. As for why this pattern exists at all, the reason likely lies in the fact that the STHs look at their cost basis differently depending on the wider trend being followed in the market at the time. During bear markets, the investors look at their acquisition price as a chance to escape. They believe that selling at their cost basis would at least mean that they can avoid taking losses. It’s this selling that becomes the source of resistance at the line. Related Reading: Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: Why Arbitrum, Optimism Will Profit Massively In rallies, on the other hand, the STHs generally hold a bullish sentiment. They look at their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity, as they think that the price would go up in the near future. The mass buying when the price touches the line may explain why the asset has observed rebounds here. From the chart, it’s visible that Bitcoin had recently dipped slightly under this line, raising concerns about whether the bullish regime had come to an end. In the past few days, however, the asset has been able to regain itself back above the level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Steadies Above $26K, Can Bulls Pump It Further? Since the STHs didn’t participate in selling at the level when the asset retested the line from below, it’s looking likely that they still lean towards a bullish sentiment. Naturally, this could suggest that the Bitcoin rally not be over yet after all. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,400, up 2% in the last week.

The stablecoin issuer has said that the new mint is part of its ""inventory replenish"" program to ensure stablecoin liquidity across all chains. In other crypto developments, Tradecurve has been building momentum as investors flock to the new trading platform that has the potential to rekindle interest in the DeFi space. Tether Mints Additional 1 Billion USDT Tether’s treasury has announced the minting of 1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum blockchain just two months after a separate 1 billion USDT token was minted. So far in 2023, the stablecoin issuer has now minted over $16 billion worth of USDT tokens. Tether remains the most dominant USD-pegged stablecoin with a market cap of $83 billion. Announcing the latest mint, Tether’s CTO Paolo Ardoino, explained that the tokens were minted for chain swap and not due to a rising interest in the purchase of digital assets. Chain swap refers to the process of sending digital assets (in this case USDT) from one blockchain network to another – bridging assets across multiple blockchains. After the mint, on-chain data showed that Tether’s Treasury sent $750 million worth of USDT in a chain swap transaction to Binance. According to Arkham Intelligence, the popular blockchain analytical firm, the Tether Treasury sent the funds in three separate batches of $250 million transactions after an initial $10 test transaction. The analytical firm later reported that of the $1 billion new tokens minted, only $146 million remains on the Ethereum blockchain as the others have been swapped for USDT on other chains. Tradecurve (TCRV) Price Set to Hit $0.018 Along with the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin sectors, Tradecurve has enjoyed increasing attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Tradecurve is building the first DeFi platform where its users will have the opportunity to trade both cryptocurrencies and derivatives (like stocks, forex, options, and commodities) from a single account. Experts are bullish that the price of Tradecurve (TCRV) could easily jump above its current $0.018 price because of the magnitude of the derivatives markets. The Bank for International Settlements reports that in June 2022, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market rose to $632 trillion. The bullish predictions for the price of Tradecurve come from the platform’s potential to connect the crypto market with the global derivatives market. Experts believe the Tradecurve platform could rekindle interest in the DeFi space as crypto traders would no longer need to open more than one account to trade global financial instruments. As more traders enter into the Tradecurve ecosystem, experts predict that the price of TCRV could jump from $0.018 to as high as $1.5 by the end of 2023.

Crypto Mogul Faces Jail Time For Passport Forgery Kwon, who is charged with multibillion-dollar fraud in the United States and is wanted by South Korean authorities on similar charges, was detained in March along with Han Chang-Joon, the former finance officer of Terraform Labs, as they attempted to board a flight to Dubai at the airport in Montenegro’s capital, Podgorica. Both men were charged with forging official documents. Related Reading: Trust Wallet Token (TWT) Tallies 22% In Last Week, Will It Test $1 Mark? Kwon had argued that he believed the Costa Rican passport was a legitimate “golden passport” available to wealthy applicants seeking fast-track citizenship in certain countries. However, the court rejected this explanation and handed down the prison sentences. The case has attracted widespread media attention, as Kwon is wanted by US and South Korean authorities on fraud charges related to the collapse of Terra last May. The company’s collapse led to over $60 billion in losses and sparked investigations into Kwon’s activities. As Bloomberg reported on June 8th, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon may face multiple jail terms in different countries, according to senior South Korean prosecutor Dan Sunghan. During an interaction with Bloomberg, Sunghan stated that South Korea had conducted most of the foundational investigation into the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and had more evidence on the matter than US authorities. Related Reading: US Politician Cheers Shiba Inu Price Surge, But Trend Reversal Still Pending Sunghan believes that carrying out the investigation and trial of Kwon in South Korea is the most efficient approach to getting justice.

The vulnerability was an infinite loop bug in the Sui code, which could be triggered by a malicious smart contract and cause the blockchain’s nodes to go on an endless circle, essentially paralyzing the network.  “Differing from traditional attacks that shut down chains by crashing nodes, the HamsterWheel attack traps all nodes in a state of ceaseless operation without processing new transactions, as if they were running on a hamster wheel. This strategy can cripple entire networks, effectively rendering them inoperable,” CertiK said in a press release on Monday.  According to the Sui Foundation, once the bug was identified, a team of developers installed “two key measures that would reduce the potential impact of a similar issue in the future.” CertiK confirmed that fixes for the bug have already been rolled out and promised to publish a full technical report later.  “We are extremely pleased that the program resulted in finding and fixing this bug well before Sui went live,” Darius Goore, head of communications at Sui Foundation, told CoinDesk.  “Due to the bug bounty program, but also a robust third-party audits program, and thorough internal testing, the first six weeks of Sui mainnet have been remarkably smooth from an operational and security perspective,” he added.  “The discovery of the HamsterWheel attack demonstrates the evolving sophistication of threats to blockchain networks,” Kang Li, chief security officer at CertiK, said in a written statement.

Do Kwon was accused of traveling with forged documents and sending financial donations to a former Montenegro minister. But according to a South Korean media, Segye’s report, Do Kwon told the Montenegrin Basic Court that he received his travel documents from a Chinese agency and wasn’t aware they were forged. Kwon also denies sending financial donations to the current leader of the Europe Now party Milojko Spajic, during his tenure as the Montenegro finance minister. Do Kwon Denies Forging Documents During his arrest in March 2023, the Montenegro authorities announced that Do Kwon was traveling with fake documents. A Twitter account of the European country’s Interior Minister, Filip Adzic, wrote; The person is suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean national Do Kwon, a co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Terraform Labs. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Suffers 87% Decline In Single Week Adzic also added: The former cryptocurrency king, who is behind losses of over $40 billion, has been apprehended at the Podgorica airport with forged documents. However, Do Kwon has denied forging his traveling documents and passports, including his Costa Rican passport. Instead, he blamed a Singaporean agency stating: I received my Costa Rica passport after filling in the documents required by a Singaporean agency that was recommended to me by a friend. I received my Belgian passport through another agency. Do Kwon also stated that he hadn’t doubted the authenticity of his travel documents since they’d been with him for many years. Regarding the Singaporean agency that supposedly issued the document, the Terraform founder stated he couldn’t remember the exact name but only knew it was written “in Chinese.” Terraform Founder Denies Sending Funds to Montenegro’s Former Finance Minister The second allegation Do Kwon denied was about sending payments to the former finance minister of Montenegro, Milojko Spajic, the current Europe Now party leader. On June 17, a Radio Free Europe regional arm reported that Do Kwon allegedly contacted Spajic through a letter he sent to many officials in Montenegro before the country’s last elections. But during the court hearing, Do Kwon’s lawyers stated this is categorically denied and it is not true. Apart from Do Kwon’s lawyers, the former finance minister also denied having anything to do with the Terraform founder. However, on June 6, a Montenegro news outlet Balkinsight reported that the country’s outgoing prime minister urged the prosecutors to investigate the relationship between Kwon and Spajic. Also, on June 9, a Twitter account FatMan, dedicated to updating the crypto community about Terra issues, shared an update about Do Kwon’s financial donations to Spajic. The Terraform founder has, however, denied the ties in the recent hearing. Following the court session, the presiding judge Ivana Becic announced that June 19 would be the date for a verdict on the forgery charges. Meanwhile, Do Kwon will remain in extradition custody for six months waiting for the court to grant or reject the South Korean extradition request.

The government of Venezuela could be winding down its petro cryptocurrency after members of Sunacrip, the country’s crypto watchdog, were found to be involved in a corruption scheme. Reports by Bloomberg Linea indicate that it could be the end of Venezuela’s national oil-backed cryptocurrency, the petro. Three persons linked with the country’s crypto regulator said the petro would be liquidated five years after issuance. Bitcoin.com first shared the news and reported that the decision was made as part of Sunacrip’s restructuring. The decision reportedly also includes liquidating the debts contracted with big petro holders, including department stores that decided to accept petro as a payment method. The decision to restructure Sunacrip came after its head Joselit Ramirez was arrested in March on corruption charges. Venezuelan president Nicolas Madura removed Ramirez from his position for allegedly participating in a plan to steal from the country’s oil operations. Soon after news of Ramirez’s alleged involvement in corruption came to light, energy suppliers across the country shut down various crypto-mining operations. Local media reports and tweets from Venezuela’s National Association of Cryptocurrencies indicate that crypto mining facilities were shut down in the states of Carabobo, Bolivar, and Lara. Numerous crypto exchanges were also ordered to cease their activities. The petro was introduced in 2018 as a way to sidestep sanctions imposed by the Trump and Obama administrations and has largely been viewed as a failure. The introduction of an oil-backed national crypto was met with scepticism from global leaders, and former US president Donald Trump banned US investors from trading in petro. Introduced amid a financial crisis, Venezuela no longer lists the petro as a currency. When introducing the petro, the Maduro administration permitted several crypto exchanges to operate in the country, introducing Venezuelans to cryptocurrencies as an alternative to their declining currency.

Stablecoins Have Registered An Increase In Their Supply Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, every increase in stablecoins’ supply since late 2022 has been accompanied by a rise in the price of Bitcoin. The metric of interest here is naturally the combined circulating supply of all stablecoins. When the value of this indicator rises, it means that capital is entering into the stables currently as more of their tokens are being minted. On the other hand, a decline implies investors are either redeeming these fiat-tied tokens for currencies like the dollar or shifting them into other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Generally, investors use stables whenever they want to avoid the volatility associated with most of the coins in the sector. Thus, whenever the supply of these tokens is going up, it can also be a sign that investors are possibly retreating from the volatile markets. When such investors eventually feel like the prices are right to jump back into the other assets, they simply exchange their stablecoins for their desired coins. Naturally, this can provide bullish pressure on the price of the cryptocurrency that they are shifting into. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Steadies Above $26K, Can Bulls Pump It Further? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the combined circulating supply of the stablecoins over the past year and a half: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the combined circulating supply of the stablecoins had started moving on an overall downtrend back when Bitcoin hit the bull market top. This decrease in the supply of these tokens implied the exit of capital from the market, as BTC and other coins also went down in value alongside this downtrend. In late 2022, however, the indicator finally showed a brief deviation from the downward trajectory as its value registered a sharp increase. Interestingly, not too long after this spike appeared, the price of Bitcoin started observing its rally. This increase in the supply of the stablecoins could have been a sign that a capital injection into the market took place, and as these freshly piled up stables were converted to the other coins, the market obtained its fuel for the rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retailers Buying The Dip As BTC Soars Above $26,000 In March of this year, when the rally had paused and the Bitcoin price had been going down, the metric had once again spiked, implying that investors may have possibly been withdrawing their BTC into the stables. After the bottom below $20,000, however, the supply of the stablecoins once more dropped, suggesting that holders were potentially exchanging back into Bitcoin. Naturally, the price of the asset observed a bullish boost from this, as the rally kicked back on. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator has been rising again recently. Given that all such rises in the metric have been bullish for BTC during recent months, it’s possible that this fresh influx of capital can provide fuel for the asset this time as well. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,400, up 2% in the last week.

Bloomberg reports that a Montenegrin Basic Court in the country’s capital of Podgorica sentenced Do Kwon and his associate Han Chang-Joon to four months in jail for forging travel documents. The infamous co-founder of the collapsed Terraform Labs was arrested in March in Podgorica, where he was found attempting to travel to Dubai with a forged passport. Kwon and Joon were found guilty of forgery charges, and two Costa Rican and Belgian passports and two identity cards belonging to Kwon and Joon were confiscated. A Basic Court in Podgorica shared the verdict on Monday and said the pair’s time spent in detention would be included in their sentence. The duo have been in custody despite being released on bail early in June. Do Kwon: An Internationally Wanted Man Kwon is a South Korean national who stands accused on charges of multibillion-dollar fraud related to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022. Terraform’s algorithmic stablecoin and crypto project Terra-Luna collapsed, wiping out $40 billion in market cap and sending the overall crypto market into a spiral. Following Terra’s collapse, South Korean authorities charged Kwon in September for violating its Capital Markets Act and issued a warrant for his arrest. The International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) accordingly issued a red notice for Kwon, signalling international law enforcement agencies to track him down and arrest him on charges of fraud. US Federal prosecutors further indicted Kwon with two counts each of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy. Both South Korea and the US are seeking Kwon’s extradition.

13978685,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538527,1687186829,"Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Already Bottomed, Sets Halving Price","Bitcoin has continued to struggle to sustain the $26,000 support level as bearish sentiment continues to dominate the market. Its drawdown in the last few weeks has led to speculations that the digital asset could be headed for a new cycle low. However, one crypto analyst firmly believes that Bitcoin has already marked its cycle bottom. Crypto Analyst PlanB Says $15,500 Was Bitcoin Bottom In November 2022, FTX which was the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world at the time collapsed and filed for bankruptcy following a massive bank run. This collapse reverberated through the market and triggered a massive crash across crypto assets in the space. As a result, Bitcoin was in a freefall from above $30,000 before bottoming out at $15,500. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bleeds As SEC Pressures Mount, Is It Time To Buy? In January 2023, PlanB told his over 1.8 million Twitter followers that the $15,500 bottom of November 2022 was the cycle bottom for the market. The analyst believed that the digital asset would not fall below this level again and has now reiterated his stance once more. PlanB said in a tweet on Sunday that he stands by the earlier prediction he had made six months ago and that Bitcoin was going to rise going into the 2024 halving. At the same time, he also reiterated his $32,000 halving price in 2024. I still stand by my Jan 12 #Bitcoin view: – Nov 2022 $15.5K was the bottom (50% disagreed!) – Rise into 2024 halving (from $18K on Jan 12) – Next: halving price above $32K https://t.co/V74Y8VYCVo pic.twitter.com/bfEOEqiBAv — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) June 18, 2023 This means that the analyst expects the price of Bitcoin to actually rise from this level as a $32,000 price level would mean a 20% addition from the current price. Interestingly, the analyst also predicts that BTC’s price will cross $100,000 in 2025. BTC Could See Further Upside The current market trend could play into PlanB’s forecast for the future of Bitcoin. The digital asset has now been consolidating toward the downside for a couple of weeks now which could mark an opportunistic level for a bounce. If this happens, the cryptocurrency could easily retake $30,000 as long as bulls are able to hold up momentum. BTC price reclaims $26,500 resistance | Souce: BTCUSD on TradingView.com BTC has also successfully risen above its 100-day moving average, indicating a return of bullish sentiment among market participants. This was the case back in January 2023 before the rally and such a move could be replicated here once more. Related Reading: SUI Defies Bear Market With 15% Rally, Is A Return To $1 Imminent? The halving event is also drawing closer which has been a historically bullish event for the price of the digital asset. Each bull market has begun with a Bitcoin halving, thus providing ample reason to believe the next bull market will begin in 2024. Presently, the price of BTC is changing hands at a price of $26,519, down 0.35% in the last 24 hours but seeing gains of 1.53% on the weekly chart.

13978653,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4612334-bitcoin-new-fantasy-despite-summer-lull-and-uncertainties-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1687186684,Bitcoin: New Fantasy Despite Summer Lull And Uncertainties (Technical Analysis),"Summary Bitcoin prices have recovered by 8.2% to around USD26,850 in the past two days, possibly due to BlackRock's application for a Bitcoin ETF. Despite recent declines, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen positive price developments since the beginning of the year, with gains of 60% and 46%, respectively. The ongoing recovery in Bitcoin prices should provide insight into the state of the crypto sector and whether a clear trend reversal and breakout from the downtrend channel will occur. With prices reaching nearly USD31,000, Bitcoin's recovery rally hit its peak on April 14th. This resulted in a doubling of prices within a span of five months. Our initial two price targets of USD25,000 and USD30,000 were achieved. Review However, since mid-April, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) have been drifting into a sluggish consolidation, reaching lows of around USD24,750 last Thursday, which represents a decline of over 20%. As a result of this correction, the overall market capitalization of the entire crypto sector decreased from USD1.26 trillion down to USD1.02 trillion, a decline of approximately 19%. Due to the significant downward pressure on most altcoins in recent weeks, the Bitcoin dominance has risen to 48%. Strong bounce in the last two days Nevertheless, in the past two days, Bitcoin bulls have made a comeback. With a sharp recovery, prices have already rebounded by around 8.2% to approximately USD26,850. While it is not yet a sustainable trend reversal, it is at least a clear sign of life! The reason behind this increase is likely the announcement that BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on spot prices. The approval of such an ETF by the SEC is highly uncertain, as previous Bitcoin ETF applications have faced significant resistance and concerns from regulatory authorities. If the SEC does approve BlackRock's application, a flood of new Bitcoin ETF products could enter the market. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum vs. altcoins vs. Gold vs. Silver in USD year-to-date, as of June 17th, 2023. (TradingView) Overall, the price development since the beginning of the year has been clearly positive for both Bitcoin (+60%) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) (+46%). However, altcoins have given back almost all of their gains (+7.59%) due to the upcoming delisting on the Robinhood trading platform. Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) has gained 6.4%, while silver ( XAGUSD:CUR ) has made little progress so far this year, with a gain of only 0.82%. While the SEC, under the leadership of Garry Gensler, has been intensifying its scrutiny of major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance in recent weeks, the sector has lacked momentum and positive catalysts. Even before the traditional summer lull, the sector was severely impacted by high uncertainty. However, with the BlackRock application for a Bitcoin ETF, the sector could regain momentum, as a Bitcoin spot ETF is expected to bring significant new inflows of capital and purchasing demand. Technical analysis for Bitcoin in US-dollar Bitcoin Weekly Chart - Tenacious and healthy correction so far Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of June 17th, 2023. (TradingView) Starting from its low point on November 21st at USD15,479, Bitcoin was able to recover quite vigorously until April 14th. However, the bulls ran out of steam at USD31,000, while crypto speculators indulged unabashedly in the meme coin hysteria surrounding Pepe and others. In hindsight, this was an unmistakable sign of the approaching end of the first wave of recovery and a short-term peak. Although Bitcoin has retraced by 20.2% to USD24,750 in the meantime, there was a clear lack of panic or a sharp wave. Instead, prices slid slowly and rather leisurely south for the last two months. However, the downtrend remains intact. Yet, the psychological level of USD25,000, along with the mid-term trendline of the larger overarching uptrend channel, at least temporarily halted the bears' progress. However, a look at the weekly stochastic indicator still shows an established sell signal, and the oscillator still has plenty of room to move further down toward its oversold zone. Thus, the next strong support on the weekly chart is likely to be found only at the lower Bollinger Band (USD21,352) and the lower edge of the uptrend channel (currently around USD21,460) of the past eight months. In summary, the weekly chart is bearish, and a medium-term decline towards approximately USD21,750 and USD22,250 still needs to be anticipated. Bitcoin Daily Chart - Reversal above the rising 200-day moving average Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of June 17th, 2023. (TradingView) On the daily chart, a downtrend channel has formed over the last two months, which would currently allow the bears some room on the downside until approximately USD24,200. At the same time, the 200-day moving average (USD23,835) swiftly caught up with the current price action from below. A reunion with this widely watched moving average seemed highly likely. However, Bitcoin has already turned up before reaching it, and the daily stochastic indicator is showing a new buy signal. Immediate and significant price declines are therefore not likely in the near term, and the encounter with the 200-day moving average may have been postponed indefinitely. Overall, the daily chart has switched to a bullish stance. The down-wave appears to have found its low point at USD24,750. The ongoing recovery should provide us with more insight into the state of Bitcoin shortly. If a clear trend reversal and a breakout from the downtrend channel will occur with prices above USD27,500, the path to the upside would be clear. Another attempt to break through the resistance zone between USD29,000 and USD31,000 could be possible in mid-summer already. However, if the ongoing bounce remains weak, the arguments for a continuation of the correction towards USD22,500 and lower would strengthen. Sentiment Bitcoin - New fantasy despite summer lull and uncertainties Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of June 17th, 2023. (Lookintobitcoin) Sentiment in the crypto sector has cooled down in line with the declining prices in recent weeks. According to the ""Crypto Fear & Greed Index,"" the sentiment is neutral with a value of 47. Crypto Fear & Greed Index long term, as of June 17th, 2023. (Lookintobitcoin) In the larger picture, the recovery wave in April already failed to reach extreme sentiment levels. Therefore, sentiment-wise, Bitcoin remains in a state of uncertainty. From this perspective, the end of the bear market cannot be declared yet, as the recovery movement between January and April was still relatively weak. At the same time, the current sentiment does not impede a continuation of the recovery. Overall, Bitcoin is far from euphoria and excessive optimism. However, there is no contrarian buying opportunity due to high levels of fear and panic either. Seasonality Bitcoin - Is the early summer rally starting now? Seasonality for Bitcoin, as of June 8th, 2023. (Seasonax) The seasonal pattern has only partially played out this year, as Bitcoin reached its high point in April already and has been falling since then. Perhaps Mr. Gensler disrupted the typical rally in May and June. However, the recovery of the past two days may have now provided the delayed start signal for the strength phase in early summer. In that case, the next two months should deliver a strong rally in the sector. Alternatively, if we stick to the early peak in April, according to the seasonal statistics, an average correction of approximately four months should follow. In this scenario, Bitcoin may potentially reach an important low point not before early August. Overall, the current situation actually contradicts the seasonal pattern, which would be unfavorable from now until autumn. However, it's possible that this year, the typical rally between mid-April and mid-June simply occurs two months later. Sound Money: Bitcoin vs. Gold Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio, weekly chart as of June 17th, 2023. (TradingView) In spring, Bitcoin reached its peak more than three weeks before gold. During the recovery, the Bitcoin/Gold ratio initially climbed to 15.25. With Bitcoin trading at around USD26,650 and gold at USD1,957, currently, one Bitcoin costs approximately 13.62 ounces of gold. Vice versa, one ounce of gold currently costs about 0.073 Bitcoin. Overall, since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin has clearly been the faster horse, outperforming gold by a factor of 10! During the correction, the ratio recently dropped back to 12.8. However, since Thursday, Bitcoin has been turning upwards again, and the recovery since the beginning of the year may continue. Additionally, the lower Bollinger Band on the weekly chart opposes significantly lower ratio values (below 12). Therefore, for those who wish to adjust their ""safe haven"" allocation in favor of Bitcoin, now, or at ratio values around 12, would likely be a suitable time to do so. In summary, the Bitcoin/Gold ratio has corrected as expected. Although the weekly stochastic indicator is far from being oversold, we anticipate a recovery over the next two months, with ratio values around 15. Macro update - Deceptive calmness After numerous bank collapses in March, which even led to a bank run in the U.S., the situation has significantly calmed down in recent weeks. Fed balance sheet vs. net liquidity vs. S&P 500, as of June 9th, 2023. (Pictet Asset Management) The reason for this deceptive calmness can be attributed to massive liquidity injections (Bank Term Funding Program) by the American central bank. Instead of implementing the planned ""Quantitative Tightening"" of USD750 billion, there is now, in essence, a form of ""Quantitative Easing Light"" of approximately USD100 billion! The increase in net liquidity is a result of US banks being able to borrow from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at a credit cost of 5% interest per year to cover their significantly decreased bonds at USD1.00 instead of their real value of USD0.50. While this credit incurs interest, it has temporarily pushed the problem into the future and avoided a liquidity crisis. This is why the stock markets are rising, as the S&P 500 is up more than 27.5% since last November. No doubt, the crack-up boom is underway! US Fed balance sheet vs. Fed funds rate, as of June 14th, 2023. (Holger Zschaepitz) Last Wednesday evening, the Fed decided not to further increase interest rates after more than a year of aggressive hikes. However, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell indicated that the pause may only be temporary, as the Fed implies two more 25 basis points rate hikes later this year. With its rigorous tightening cycle, the Fed has already shattered the porcelain. The hastily concocted rescue programs since March have only masked the problems, while a massive smoldering fire continues to burn behind the scenes of the financial system. Hiking cycle brought the end of easy money Bankruptcy filings in the US, as of June 7, 2023. (S&P Global) For those who make the effort to seek facts beyond the mainstream, they will discover, for example, that the number of bankruptcy filings in the US this year has reached the highest level since 2010. The underlying reason is that the increased interest rates have made debt much more expensive. Additionally, the investors who are supposed to buy these debts have become more cautious because the easy money, once abundant due to the low interest rates, is no longer readily available. However, once companies become reliant on easy money to sustain themselves due to high debt levels, it becomes challenging to break free from this dependency. In a way, the economy is normalizing with interest rates typical of the pre-QE era. But companies that could survive only because of easy money are now feeling the pressure. Commercial real estate is the next shoe to drop Furthermore, the next storm is brewing, particularly in the US commercial real estate sector. Currently, numerous US banks are hurrying to reduce their exposure to this sector due to an imminent wave of payment defaults. PacWest recently sold a construction loan portfolio worth USD2.6 billion at a significant loss, while HSBC is seeking to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in commercial real estate loans as quickly as possible. Many regional lenders, in particular, may have to consider selling commercial real estate loans at a substantial discount. As the sales gain momentum, the downward spiral accelerates, further depressing property prices. It is likely that nearly half of the 4,800 American banks have already depleted their capital buffers and are potentially insolvent. Meanwhile, vacancy rates in offices and retail stores in San Francisco for example continue to soar, while safety concerns and drug abuse deter tourists and visitors. The city could become one of the epicenters of the next apocalypse. Recently, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield ( UNBLF ) and Brookfield Corp. ( BN ) had to transfer ownership of the city's largest shopping center to the lender after they were no longer able to make payments on the USD558 million loan. Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. ( PK ) has also halted loan payments for two downtown hotels with outstanding debts totaling USD725 million. A wave of payment defaults and bankruptcies is looming The boom and bust cycle will continue, as the tightest policies from the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) in 15 years collide with high levels of debt and adventurous derivative structures. The foreseeable wave of payment defaults in the US and Europe will also hit the real economy hard, with default rates possibly not peaking before the fourth quarter of 2024 or even later. In the past, the Fed halted its aggressive interest rate hike cycle back in June 2006. However, the major financial crisis only began a year and a half later! Therefore, the financial markets are facing challenging times ahead. While the buzzword ""AI"" is currently celebrated in the stock markets, the low volatility is likely just the calm before the next storm. While precious metals may provide protection right at the beginning of the crisis this time, Bitcoin will face difficulties during stock market turbulence and may only experience sustained growth during subsequent rescue programs. Conclusion: Bitcoin - New fantasy despite summer lull and uncertainties After sliding south for two months, Bitcoin has started a recovery in the past two days. Soon, it should become evident from a technical analysis perspective whether the ""Bitcoin ETF fantasy"" is enough to push the prices back above USD27,500. If successful, a rise to around USD30,000 and even USD35,000 could be possible by mid-summer. Alternatively, due to the lingering regulatory uncertainties, the sector may fall back into its recent premature summer lethargy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4612334-bitcoin-new-fantasy-despite-summer-lull-and-uncertainties-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13978653.jpeg

The approval of the Financial Services and Markets Bill (FSMB) on Monday by Parliament’s upper chamber, the House of Lords, means the bill is going to enter the final stages before it is put into law.  The wide-ranging bill, spanning over 340 pages, was introduced in July to take advantage of Brexit freedoms and give regulators more power over the U.K. financial system. While the original bill included a proposal to regulate stablecoins under the country’s payments rules, amendments to treat all crypto as a regulated activity and measures to supervise crypto promotions were added later as the bill progressed through Parliament.  The U.K. wants the FSMB to give regulators the powers that they need to be able to set crypto rules that the Treasury, the government's finance arm, has been consulting on. New specific rules for the crypto sector could come within 12 months, Economic Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith told CNBC in April. The U.K. is trying to catch up with the European Union, which recently finalized its Markets in Crypto Assets regulation that has a predominant focus on stablecoins.  Next, the FSMB will be returned to the lower house of Parliament to agree on a final version. Once both houses agree on the document, it will be sent to the King to be approved and passed into law. The bill can be sent back and forth between the chambers of Parliament until a consensus is reached.

We explained why BITF is lingering around $1, not rising or falling. We provided evidence to support our claim that BITF's adjustment to HODL policy was done out of necessity and not by choice. Although BITF is trading below book value (making it undervalued) and has an 85% and 260% potential upside should Bitcoin recover past $69k and $100k, BITF has delisting risks. Introduction It’s very nostalgic whenever we cover Bitfarms ( BITF ). It rekindles our past trades where we successfully called the rally from $4 to $9 and sold call options to increase our returns. This series of trades lasted around 5–6 months, and we covered every step of the way to guide expectations and the respective actionable plans. It’s one of the series of trades we’re very proud of. Fast-forward to today, BITF has undergone several major strategic overhauls. Firstly, BITF diverged from 100% renewable-powered to partially renewable-powered. Secondly, BITF adjusted its HODL policy to liquidate Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) production reserves to expand and “ enhance liquidity and to de-leverage and strengthen our balance sheet ”. Regardless of whether we favor these policies, BITF managed to maintain its world-class mining operation (in terms of efficiency, Table i ) and survive. On top of that, we have a BITF that is de-leveraged and leaner, which may or may not be a good thing. In this article, we’re going to provide our price targets for BITF and discuss several key points that we think investors should consider before investing in BITF. Table i. Total Mining Cost Per Bitcoin Comparison QR BITF CLSK MARA 2023Q1 26,600 33,276 32,100 2022Q4 34,200 30,500 44,400 2022Q3 25,900 35,627 91,200 2022Q2 27,155 37,600 81,683 2022Q1 34,340 42,800 31,700 2021Q4 35,000 46,400 32,240 2021Q3 24,000 57,506 95,850 2021Q2 33,025 119,000 21,000 2021Q1 59,137 74,500 Source: Author Our View On BITF’s New HODL Policy BITF’s previous Bitcoin policy is to retain 100% of self-mined Bitcoins. This allows BITF’s valuation to inflate together with Bitcoin’s price. This was one of the main drivers behind BITF’s rally in 2021. On the flip side, BITF had to cover expenses and funds through financing measures (equity offerings and debt). According to BITF: Since January 2021, we have been funding operations and growth through various financing measures. We believe that selling a portion of our BTC holdings and daily production as a source of liquidity is the best and least expensive method in the current market environment. By referring to Table 1, we can see that BITF’s liability and shares outstanding were increasing at a rapid rate when BITF is HODL-ing Bitcoins. After the HODL policy adjustment, total liability decreased drastically while shareholder dilution slowed down. Table 1. BITF's Historical Total Liability and Shares Outstanding QR Total Liability Shares Outstanding 2023Q1 59.3 240,262,000 2022Q4 87.5 224,200,000 2022Q3 114 215,711,000 2022Q2 137.95 206,339,320 2022Q1 179 201,626,602 2021Q4 120 194,805,893 2021Q3 40.6 174,445,684 2021Q2 30.3 162,083,352 2021Q1 22 145,016,864 Source: Author On the surface, this looks good. BITF stated that this policy adjustment is strategic: In consideration of extreme volatility in the markets, we have continued to take action to enhance liquidity and to de-leverage and strengthen our balance sheet. But we think that BITF had done this out of necessity. Consider it this way, even if BITF is lean now, what will BITF’s expansion strategy be like? Is relying solely on selling self-mined Bitcoins sufficient to fund expansion, on top of operation and business costs? Let’s investigate. The Inevitable BITF’s May 2023 production is 459 Bitcoins, extrapolate for the quarter, it would be about 1,377, which is still lower than the peak in 2022Q3 (Table 2). At the current Bitcoin price ($25,500), BITF can liquidate 100% of the Bitcoin production for $35mil. BITF’s total business expense in 2023Q1 is $34mil. So it's clear that self-mined Bitcoins aren’t sufficient to fund expansions. Table 2: BITF's Historical Bitcoin Production QR Bitcoin Production 2023Q2 1377 (estimated) 2023Q1 1,297 2022Q4 1,434 2022Q3 1,515 Source: Author You might argue at BITF’s cash expense is only $17mil , so BITF would have $18mil to fund expansion, right? We would counter by saying depreciation is an actual cost and BITF also must make loan repayments. Depreciation is an actual cost because mining machines have useful lives. Beyond the useful life, the mining machines will become unprofitable, and they’re also susceptible to wear and tear. Therefore, we can say that self-mined Bitcoins are insufficient to fund expansion. This is very critical because BITF would be left with two choices: raise funds through equity or liability. In the past (Table 1), BITF resorted to both. By doing so, won’t BITF undo de-leveraging efforts and be back to square one (levered and diluted)? Another supporting point we can make is if self-mined Bitcoins can fund expansion, why is it necessary to liquidate more than 90% of the Bitcoin reserves to pay back debt (Table 3)? Therefore, we think being ‘de-leveraged’ a strategy is a necessity, not a choice. Let’s dive deeper. Table 3. BITF's Historical Bitcoin Reserves QR BTC Reserves 2023Q2 435 2023Q1 405 2022Q4 2,065 2022Q3 3,144 2022Q2 5,646 (April) Source: Author Bitcoin Reserve Liquidation: A Necessity, Not Choice Firstly, BITF couldn’t risk further major shareholder dilution to fund operations and expansions due to the risks of Nasdaq delisting. Towards the end of 2022Q4, BITF received a Nasdaq notification for failing to meet the exchange's minimum bid price listing requirement because BITF traded below the minimum $1 per share for more than 30 days. Fortunately, Bitcoin’s timely recovery push BITF back above $1. Even though Bitcoin has traded higher than in January, BITF has been trading near and sometimes below $1. Any further increase in outstanding shares (shareholder dilution) could risk devaluating the share price. We speculate that there might be forces supporting BITF's $1 support level. This may explain why BITF has been lingering around $1. This could address some comments we read on Seeking Alpha about BITF lingering around $1, not rising or falling. Secondly, BITF had to pay back the expiring loan to prevent bankruptcy. By referring to Figure 1, we can see that BITF has to repay $21mil of debt over the next 4 quarters. There are also other obligations totaling $19.5mil that have to be repaid. Therefore, we think that BITF’s HODL policy is out of necessity, not by choice. Figure 1. BITF's Financial Commitments (BITF) The Resulting Expansion Headwinds and Mining Difficulty Given the constraints discussed above, it is no wonder BITF suffered a series of expansion setbacks and constant revision downwards. In 2021Q3, BITF had 2 EH/s mining capacity and guided investors that BITF would achieve 8 EH/s by the end of 2022. In 2022Q1, BITF revised the end-of-2022 target to 6 EH/s . But by 2022Q4, BITF failed to attain the 6 EH/s target and delayed it for another year . It seems that BITF will finally be attaining its 6 EH/s capacity by 2023Q3 . Unfortunately, the Bitcoin network hash rate (or the mining difficulty) grew by 93% annually . Due to the slow growth of BITF’s mining capacity and increasing mining difficulty, BITF has suffered a decline in Bitcoin production (Table 4). In the 2022Q4 and 2023Q1 quarterly reports, BITF attributed the decline in production to increasing mining difficulty: 13% increase in hash rate was offset by lower BTC prices and 20% increase in network difficulty” However, we could also say that BITFs just couldn’t keep up with the competitors. Since the mining difficulty is the sum of the mining capacity of every Bitcoin miner, it implies that competitors are simply growing faster than BITF. Table 4 shows the Bitcoin production and mining capacities of other Bitcoin mining companies. We can see that CleanSpark ( CLSK ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), and Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) did not suffer a decline in production. Their mining capacities have also undergone a massive expansion. Only HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ), which suffered from Ethereum’s pivot to Proof-of-Stake, trailed BITF. Table 4: Bitcoin Production Comparison QR BITF CLSK MARA RIOT HIVE 2023Q1 1,297 1871 2195 2115 2022Q4 1,434 1,531 1562 1689 792 2022Q3 1515 1,228 616 1042 787 2022Q2 1,257 964 707 1,395 1380* 2022Q1 961 899 1,259 1405 2021Q4 1,045 660 1,098 1355 2021Q3 1,051 409 1,252 1292 2021Q2 759 191 654 675 2021Q1 598 144 192 491 Source: Author (*include Ethereum) If BITF refuses to be left behind like HIVE, BITF needs to expand at a rapid rate. Unfortunately, BITF has run out of Bitcoin reserves to liquidate, while Bitcoin production is not sufficient to fund expansion. In addition, constraints on further shareholder dilution and liability will risk Nasdaq delisting. These headwinds are further reflected by a lack of expansion guidance beyond the 6 EH/s target. Therefore, we are not optimistic about BITF’s growth prospects. Valuation BITF is currently trading at around the same market cap as CLSK, and HIVE. Furthermore, CLSK also uses a similar HODL strategy as BITF where CLSK liquidates most of the self-mined Bitcoin. However, CLSK is expected to expand to 16 EH/s by the end of 2023 compared to BITF’s 6 EH/s. Hence, it will be interesting to compare whether BITF’s world-class mining efficiency can outperform CLSK’s massive mining capacity in terms of potential upside. Since both CLSK and BITF are trading below book value, we take them as undervalued. As for BITF’s potential upside, our model suggests that BITF has a 110% and 260% upside at a $69,000 and $100,000 Bitcoin respectively. Comparatively, CLSK has 200% and 470% upside if Bitcoin increases to $69,000 and $100,000 respectively. This implies that BITF’s lower total mining cost per Bitcoin is advantageous during a crypto winter, but CLSK’s higher mining capacity is more advantageous in capturing the upsides during a Bitcoin bull market. That being said, our model suggests that BITF's upside is greater than both MARA’s and RIOT’s . Verdict We think that BITF is undervalued and has a 110% to 260% potential upside. However, balance sheet constraints, mining difficulty, and slow capacity expansion are headwinds to BITF’s growth. More important, BITF could risk Nasdaq delisting if Bitcoin crashes or if BITF does not solve Bitcoin production issues soon enough. Therefore, we suggest giving CLSK a look as CLSK also trading below book value, trading at a similar market cap as CLSK, and a much higher guided mining capacity.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4612327-bitfarms-bitcoin-mining-company-falls-short-in-scale?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13977512.jpeg

This rapid increase has sparked speculation and curiosity among traders and investors about whether TWT will reach the highly anticipated $1 mark. The Surge Of Trust Wallet Token (TWT): Factors And Analysis Trust Wallet Token is a cryptocurrency associated with the popular mobile wallet for holding/storing digital assets, Trust Wallet. The integration of TronDAO Staking V2 into TrustWallet on June 16 likely positively impacted the price of the Trust Wallet token (TWT). The feature increased user convenience and utility, attracting more investor confidence, increasing the demand for TWT, and raising its price. Related Reading: PEPE Sustains Steady Ascent, Fueling Speculation Of Profits Also, the recent partnership between Trust Wallet and Tezos offering users a free McLaren F1 digital collectible likely positively impacted the Trust Wallet Token (TWT). The development created excitement and increased user engagement, potentially leading to increased demand for TWT and subsequent price growth. As of the time of writing, Trust Wallet Token (TWT) is exhibiting a bullish momentum, resulting in a 24-hour increase of 2.26%, representing a price mark of $0.9212. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the trading volume of TWT experienced a significant increase. Specifically, it jumped by more than 13% and reached a value of $19 Million. This notable surge in trading volume suggests that there has been a genuine retail buy-up from members of the Trust Wallet community. The Prospects Of Trust Wallet Token Reaching The $1 Mark At present, the Trust Wallet Token is trading above the middle line of the Bollinger Bands indicator, which suggests that the price is currently higher than the average value. This can be seen as a positive sign, indicating potential strength or bullishness in the asset’s price trend. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) of the Trust Wallet Token ($TWT) is above its signal line, and the histogram bars display green, signifying a robust bullish signal. The combination of these indicators suggests a strong bullish momentum and $TWT can potentially hit the $1 mark soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: Why Arbitrum, Optimism Will Profit Massively One important advantage investors in TWT might consider is that its value is based on its fundamental usefulness.

13977130,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/independent-reserve-eyes-expansion-to-hongkong,1687183200,Independent Reserve Eyes Expansion To Hongkong,"The Sydney-based crypto exchange is eyeing an expansion to Hong Kong in the “next few months” according to an interview with Lasanka Perera, the CEO of its Singapore operations. Having had a solid foundation in Singapore for the past decade, Perera says that the firm is now looking for other hubs and is currently applying for a license to operate in Hong Kong. Perera cited Hong Kong’s advantage as an “active financial hub with deep capital markets.” Towards the end of October last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) enacted an overhaul on its crypto regulations which introduced tighter restrictions and discouraged retail trading. Perera commented on how these restrictions caused a significant drop in Independent Reserve’s business, forcing the exchange to focus more on wealth management and Web3 payment segments. Perera also notes the conservatism Around the same time, Hong Kong announced an easing up on its regulations, culminating in the announcement just last March of an open regulatory framework which took effect this June. This new framework encouraged the adoption of digital assets while protecting its users from crises in the sector and is expected to foster the development and growth of the digital asset market. Regulatory Shifts Impacting Market Strategies The stricter regulatory environment imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in October last year has served as a critical inflection point for crypto firms like Independent Reserve. The introduction of tighter constraints on cryptocurrency trading, particularly discouraging retail trading, had a significant impact on Independent Reserve's business, causing a marked drop in trading activity. In contrast, Hong Kong has welcomed digital assets with more liberal regulatory practices, a move that Independent Reserve sees as an opportunity for expansion. Hong Kong's open regulatory framework, enacted this June, aims to foster digital asset adoption while providing user protection. This proactive, balanced approach to digital asset regulation makes Hong Kong an attractive market for crypto companies seeking a more welcoming regulatory climate. Eyeing Expansion Beyond Asia Independent Reserve's expansion strategy does not stop in Asia. The firm is also setting sights further afield, notably towards Dubai. Perera highlights that stepping into Dubai would potentially open up pathways to affluent European markets and capital. This strategic move underscores the firm's ambition to become a truly global player in the digital asset space. However, the key to successful market entry hinges on Dubai adopting sensible and supportive regulations for crypto exchanges. Independent Reserve's leadership is watching regulatory developments closely as they form the backbone of their growth strategy. As the firm plans its next steps, observers are waiting to see how these international expansions will reshape the broader crypto landscape. Hong Kong is well on its way to becoming a crypto hub in Southeast Asia and observers will take note of the way this relates to China’s crypto policies as a whole; Perera himself has noted how Hong Kong is “the doorway to [greater] China”. And of course, one will have to take note how this squares with the especially dire state of the cryptocurrency sector in the United States.

This action followed an accusation by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who identified it as a ""scam crypto account."" Interestingly, the bot was intrinsically linked to the ERC-20 memecoin, Bob Token (BOB), whose price spiraled downward by over 30% in the aftermath of the suspension, clearly indicating the real-world repercussions of such allegations. Suspension of 'Explain This Bob' Sparks Controversy ""Explain This Bob,"" an AI-powered bot engineered by Prabhu Biswal from India, employed OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to decipher and respond to tweets associated with its account. Garnering over 400,000 followers before its suspension, the bot held substantial influence within the platform. Bob Token, launched in April and directly connected with the bot, even caught the attention of Musk earlier on, who had tweeted, “I love Bob.” Twitter's decision to spare the Bob Token's account while suspending the bot reveals a discernible separation between the suspected irregularities associated with the bot and the perceived legitimacy of the linked crypto token. Following the suspension, the Bob Token project team responded with a humorous meme depicting Musk keeping an eye on a distressed “Bob” in prison. The subsequent rallying of the Twitter community behind the Bob Token, with widespread circulation of the hashtag “FREEBOB”, testifies to the bot's popularity. Supporters have vociferously argued against BOB being labelled a scam coin, asserting that the token's launch was conducted fairly, it operates on a fully decentralized mechanism, and features a 0% tax system. Twitter and Crypto: A Complex Duo Twitter's controversial suspension of 'Explain This Bob' is a snapshot of the platform's intricate dance with the world of cryptocurrencies. Serving as an influential social media platform, Twitter wields a strong hand in sculpting the crypto narrative and can sway token values significantly. This is apparent from the instant depreciation of the Bob Token's value following the suspension of the associated bot. Twitter's association with cryptocurrencies runs deep, with ex-CEO Jack Dorsey being an outspoken Bitcoin advocate, and the platform recently integrating Bitcoin as a tipping feature. Yet, this association has faced hurdles, with the platform being leveraged for spreading misinformation, initiating scams, and organizing 'pump and dump' schemes. Striking a balance between promoting discussions around cryptocurrencies and ensuring user safety from potential scams has therefore become a daunting task for Twitter. As of the last available data in September 2021, Twitter boasts over 330 million active users, with a significant portion being active participants in the crypto community. This statistic reflects the platform's integral role in driving substantial movements within cryptocurrency markets, especially when high-profile figures like Elon Musk are involved. Twitter's relationship with cryptocurrencies is indeed a delicate dance. While the platform presents an indispensable medium for disseminating crypto-related news and fostering dialogue, it also grapples with ensuring its user base remains safeguarded from potential scams and misinformation. In this sense, the crypto industry also needs to acknowledge the role of social media platforms such as Twitter is likely to become increasingly complex and significant.

A Basic Court in the country's capital Podgorica shared the verdict on Monday, adding that the time spent in detention will be included in the sentence.  The South Korean national was arrested in the Balkan nation back in March for the alleged possession of falsified documents, along with another Terra executive Han Chang-Joon. The two have remained in custody since their arrest despite local courts approving bail last week on the second try.  By the same verdict, two Costa Rican passports, two Belgian passports and two identity cards belonging to Kwon and Han were also confiscated, the court said.  Leading up to Kwon's arrest in Montenegro, the former executive maintained he was ""not on the run,"" even as authorities in South Korea started an international search for him, including requesting a red notice from Interpol.

Binance Markets Limited held several permissions from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for ""activities that it never carried out or offered"" in the U.K., a spokesperson for Binance told CoinDesk in an emailed statement Monday, confirming the firm had requested to withdraw those permissions.  ""As these permissions were unlikely to be required in the future, Binance Markets Limited decided that it would be prudent to cancel them in line with the FCA’s recommendations to keep these updated,"" the spokesperson for Binance said. ""This decision has no impact on Binance.com, which does not own or operate any crypto services in the U.K. and is only available to U.K. consumers on a reverse solicitation basis.""  Binance recently moved to withdraw its registration with a Cyprus regulator saying it was focusing on fewer European jurisdictions as the EU's new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation kicks in. The company announced on Friday that it was quitting the Netherlands after failing to obtain regulatory approval in the country.  The company is also facing regulatory heat elsewhere with its U.S. unit and founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao facing a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the alleged sale of securities and operation of an unregistered trading platform. French authorities confirmed last week that the platform has been under investigation for ""aggravated money laundering"" since at least 2022.  ""Following the completion of the cancellation of permissions the firm is no longer authorized by the FCA,"" the regulator's website said as part of a June 7 update. ""No other entity in the Binance Group holds any form of U.K. authorization or registration to conduct regulated business in the U.K.""  The FCA in 2021 famously said Binance was ""not capable of being effectively supervised,"" while telling its U.K. arm it was not allowed to carry out any regulated activities in the country.  ""The Binance Group appear to be offering U.K. customers a range of products and services via a website, Binance.com,"" the regulator said.

Developers expect the opBNB testnet to reach speeds of 4,000 transactions per second (tps) at a targeted cost of 0.005 U.S. cents per transaction. These are similar speeds seen on blockchains such as Arbitrum, double those of BNB Chain, and significantly higher than Ethereum’s 30 tps.  Testnets are simulated blockchains that mimic real-world usage, allowing developers to test applications and complex tools before deploying on a mainnet. OP Stack is the set of open-source software over which blockchains such as Optimism are based.  A persistent issue faced by blockchains is that of network congestion and high fees that spike up at times of network demand – effectively clogging applications and services built on that network.  Porting such a network to a layer 2 blockchain – which batches multiple transactions into one and submits them to a base blockchain – could help alleviate network congestion and reduce transaction costs.  opBNB's robust and EVM-compatible platform enables developers to easily create open ecosystems, facilitating the migration of applications to BSC and expanding their user base.  “Projects can leverage improved throughput and significantly lower transaction costs, resulting in a superior user experience,” developers said in the release. “Furthermore, opBNB's enhanced scalability overcomes challenges previously faced by projects with high transaction volumes on BSC and enables them to thrive.”  Developers and projects can build on the opBNB testnet starting Monday.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ARB | BNB | OP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/19/bnb-chain-releases-layer-2-testnet-based-on-optimism-op-stack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27cf527873a45e9f9ba5c554e9596323d1e0a0ca-4998x2811.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department reckons one global CBDC platform that will allow for capital controls could cut payment costs – but such a vision is a far cry from crypto enthusiasts' dream for decentralized financial systems.  Read more: New Global CBDC Platform Could Cut Payment Costs, IMF Says  “Our blueprint for a new class of platforms would enhance and ensure greater interoperability, efficiency, and safety in cross-border payments, as well as in domestic financial markets,” Adrian said in a speech given in Rabat, Morocco. “The cost, sluggishness, and opacity of cross-border payments comes from limited infrastructure.”  Earlier Monday, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the IMF was ""working hard"" on a global infrastructure to enable different CBDCs to work with each other, according to Bloomberg.  The new system, also outlined in an IMF Fintech Note published Monday, could program payments without payees giving precious private information to intermediaries, and saving liquidity by letting contracts be pledged as collateral – without changing the fully fungible nature of money, Adrian said. Adrian first proposed the idea of a CBDC platform in September.  “The ledger would be controlled by the platform operator,” Adrian added, apparently rejecting more innovative ideas such as blockchain-based validation. “The single ledger would ensure there is a unique description of who owns what, so no double spending can occur.”  A document published alongside Adrian’s speech said blockchain had “important limitations” in terms of validator costs, security, efficiency and privacy. Bitcoin-style proof-of-work technology consumes a lot of energy while Ethereum’s proof-of-stake is costly and untested, it said.  Governments would keep the right to limit their citizens’ transactions in foreign currency and impose anti-money laundering checks, Adrian said – with the IMF keen not to undermine the kinds of capital measures often imposed on countries facing a financial crisis.  Crypto proponents often cite easier cross-border payments as a major benefit – but there’s plenty of competition against free-floating blockchain solutions being used for that purpose, not least as standard-setters don't want to undermine government controls. The Bank for International Settlements and private players such as SWIFT are both looking at options involving state-backed CBDCs.  The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, a standard-setter linked to the Bank for International Settlements, is looking at the impact of stablecoins – tokens tied to the value of a fiat currency – while a report from the European Central Bank last year poured cold water on the idea crypto can cut international payment costs.

On Sunday, Bray shared his delight over SHIB’s price increase last week (+8.3%). Bray encouraged the SHIB army to keep up the positive momentum and called for further action. He also urged SHIB enthusiasts to tweet about Shiba Inu throughout the day to generate ongoing excitement. Via Twitter, he wrote: Ok #shibarmy, let’s continue the lil pump from today. Tweet $shib and #SHIB all day! Build some excitement. After all, thank goodness we aren’t PEPE. They’ll never be on Robinhood. Today Bray followed up with a partial apology to PEPE holders: “Sorry $pepe holders. Didn’t mean any offence.” However, he justified his statement and explained that he does not expect Robinhood to host any other community token in the near future. “Therefore #shib has a huge advantage on market recovery. $shib is on just about every exchange. I’m hoping y’all [PEPE] pump as well,” the North Carolina gubernatorial candidate wrote. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Suffers 87% Decline In Single Week Bray already caused a stir last week when he announced via Twitter that he will buy Shiba Inu (SHIB) with his next paycheck. According to Bray, “nothing else will ever regain the traction” that Shiba Inu has accumulated. Furthermore, Bray believes that people who have left the SHIB community will return because of Robinhood’s presence. Trend Reversal For Shiba Inu Price Remains Pending Despite all the excitement about SHIB’s recent rally, it should be pointed out that the price is still in a bearish trend. A look at the 1-day chart shows that SHIB has been stuck in a descending trend channel since the local high of $0.00001588 on February 4 this year. Over the past more than four months, Shiba Inu has failed to write higher highs while the price has written lower lows. SHIB is thus stuck in a descending trend channel. At the current price of $0.00000715, SHIB is trading in the mid-range of the trend channel. For now, it is important to break this level to start a push to the upper end. The following two scenarios are conceivable: If the Shiba Inu bulls manage to break through the mid-range, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000834 comes into focus. It is likely that SHIB will first experience a retracement before the price level can be penetrated. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Positive Social Sentiment Sparks Bullish Speculation The Fibonacci retracement level may then also meet the upper end of the trend channel. This point in time would be crucial to initiate an uptrend. Then, all eyes would be on a new local high above $0.00000930. In a second scenario, SHIB fails to break above the mid-range of the descending trend channel. In this case, SHIB could sweep the low at $0.000006 again. If the price also breaks below this level, Shiba Inu investors should prepare for a downside price discovery. Back to the bullish case: if SHIB manages to break out of the descending trend channel in the coming weeks, the following target prices would be of significance: $0.0000098 (38.2% Fibonacci), $0.00001095 (50% Fibonacci) and $0.00001212 (61.8% Fibonacci).

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin held steady over the weekend, with altcoins continuing to lag behind. Bitcoin traded between $26,200 and $26,300 and ether, starting the weekend around $1,700, remains the same. Altcoins, however, underperformed bitcoin and ether, with Chainlink’s LINK, Cosmos’ ATOM and NEAR Protocol’s NEAR all losing 3% over the last 24 hours. U.S. markets are closed today, with the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market shut in observance of Junteenth.  A federal judge signed off on a temporary agreement between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, global crypto exchange Binance and its U.S. affiliate to have Binance.US take steps to ensure only local employees can access customer funds as the regulator and companies work through an SEC lawsuit. The parties announced a deal late Friday to ensure that only Binance.US employees can access customer funds in the short term, which Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District Court Columbia signed early Saturday. The judge also ordered the parties to suggest timelines for the broader lawsuit. According to the proposed agreement, Binance.US will take steps to make sure that no officials from Binance Holdings, the global exchange, have access to private keys for wallets or hardware wallets, or root access to Binance.US' Amazon Web Services tools. The U.S.-based crypto trading platform will share detailed information about its business expenses, including estimated costs, in the coming weeks.  The release of the Hinman papers last week in the SEC's case against Ripple is a boost to ether (ETH), and is likely to trigger a move to more decentralization in the crypto market, JPMorgan said in a research report Thursday. Emails tied to former SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman’s 2018 speech saying ether did not look like a security were published last Tuesday by Ripple in its defense against an SEC lawsuit. Senior leadership at the SEC did not rank ether as a security in 2018, the report noted, and SEC officials acknowledged that the “fact that tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network are no longer securities creates a regulatory gap.""

42410368,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJz7l,1687177163,"Ethereum Developers Propose Raising Validator Limit to 2,048 Ether From 32 Ether","A bump in waiting times and the sheer amount of interest in spinning up Ethereum validator nodes is making developers consider increasing the current limits drastically.  Developers have proposed raising the validator limit from 32 ether (ETH) to 2,048 ether – a 6,300% rise. This has forced large entities, such as Lido or staking services offered by crypto exchanges, to spin up multiple validator nodes to offer staking yield services to users.  Developers said on an Ethereum core developer call on Thursday that the current limit led to a brisk expansion of the network’s validator set, albeit with a large increase in the number of validators running the network.  The proposal was first floated in early June by Ethereum developers Mike Neuder, Francesco D’Amato, Aditya Asgaonkar and Justin Drake. The proposal is still under debate and isn’t actively being worked on as of Monday.  Validators are entities in a proof-of-stake blockchain, such as Ethereum, that process transactions and help maintain the overall security of such networks.  Data shows the current waiting time for a user to run a validator node on Ethereum is 44 days, up from nearly a month in May. Exiting the network is possible within a few minutes, and no entity is in the “exit queue” as of Monday, the data shows.  The data indicates the demand for validators to enter the network and earn a nearly 5% annual yield. Such strong demand is likely stemming from large ether holders, who do not want to cash out and instead just want to earn some passive income on their holdings.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/19/ethereum-developers-propose-raising-validator-limit-to-2048-ether-from-32-ether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97680ac486719a8a5b760015e03428c85845dcce-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410372,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJzEN,1687176763,Bitcoin Could Benefit From These 3 Bullish Tailwinds,"Directional traders betting on a rise in bitcoin's (BTC) price have faced disappointment over the past two months. The top cryptocurrency by market value has pulled back by over 16% since hitting a high of $31,000 two months ago.  Still, prices are up nearly 60% year-to-date, a stellar performance compared to Nasdaq's, Wall Street's tech-heavy index, 38% rise. The path of least resistance may be on the higher side, thanks to macroeconomic developments and other bullish tailwinds.  Dollar weakness and dwindling bond market volatility  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, fell by 1.2% to 102.30 last week, registering its third straight weekly loss. The losing streak has reversed more than 50% of the bounce seen in the preceding three weeks, which, in part, weighed over crypto prices.  ""Any decline in the dollar is good for bitcoin (and vice versa). That’s why BTC and risk assets have had their strongest bull runs during DXY bear markets,"" crypto intelligence firm Jarvis Labs noted in a weekly blog post.  ""With the Fed’s actions this week in pausing rate hikes (plus inflation cooling), it looks like the dollar’s days above 100 may be numbered,"" Jarvis Labs added.  The Federal Reserve (Fed) kept rates steady between 5% and 5.25% last week, pausing the 15-month rate hike cycle that pushed the dollar higher and roiled risk assets last year. The central bank left the door open for continued rate hikes over the coming months, but analysts are not sure it will walk the talk.  ""The reason that I don’t think there will be more rate hikes is that inflation is responding. Slowly, but it’s getting there, and raising rates risks adding unnecessary strain to an already fragile banking system that has barely started to process the looming damage from commercial real estate loans,"" Noelle Acheson, the author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter said in the weekly recap published Saturday.  The U.S. Treasury (bond market) volatility is declining fast. That often leads to increased risk-taking in financial markets.  Data from the charting platform TradingView shows the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. bond market options volatility index declined nearly 10% last week, hitting the lowest since February.  Blackrock's ETF move  BlackRock (BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, filed for a spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) last week, offering a positive surprise to the market battered by a steady stream of bad news over the past 12 months.  Per CF Benchmark's author Ken Odeluga, the proposed fund shows institutional appetite for bitcoin-based products remains strong in the wake of last year's horrible bear market.  ""With its latest proposed fund, BlackRock is demonstrating an assessment that investor demand for Bitcoin exposure is broad enough to support a mainstream bitcoin product, offered in the regulated, convenient and familiar wrapper of an exchange-traded fund,"" (BlackRock plans to use the CF Benchmarks' bitcoin reference rate).  The U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) has rejected several applications for spot ETF, citing concerns about bitcoin price manipulation. Blackrock might succeed as the application includes a surveillance-sharing agreement, which could eliminate the risk of market manipulation.  Per some observers, BlackRock's application could be a message to the SEC Chair Gary Gensler that BlackRock, headed by prominent Democrat supporter Larry Fink, does not support the SEC's anti-crypto stance. In contrast, others believe it's a genuine attempt to win approval.  ""Either way, it is a very welcome positive development and puts further pressure on the SEC to clarify its crypto stance beyond “come in and register. The political battle around the future role of crypto markets in U.S. financial innovation is getting heated but is far from burning out,"" Acheson noted.  Safe haven demand  Earlier this month, the SEC sued leading crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase (COIN), accusing them of offering a number of alternative cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities. The lawsuits did not mention bitcoin and ether (ETH).  ""The regulatory risk is mainly concentrated on altcoins investors, which has a limited impact on holders who only hold BTC and ETH,"" Matt Hu, CEO of crypto asset management firm Blofin wrote in a blogpost over the weekend.  ""However, Once the SEC lawsuit is successful, all altcoins may be recognized as securities and need to be regulated by securities standards, which means that the trading of altcoins will be more offshore and decentralized. Moreover, liquidity will be more concentrated in BTC, ETH, and other mainstream cryptos.""  Bitcoin's dominance rate has broken out of a three-year oscillation pattern in a sign of investors rotating money out of altcoins and into bitcoin.  Pseudonymous analyst The DeFi Investor voiced a similar opinion on Twitter saying, bitcoin may continue to outperform altcoins, given the breakout in the dominance rate.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/19/3-bullish-tailwinds-to-consider-for-bitcoins-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e97a751a652645db0ed4ca7165719b161a61bb5-2464x1386.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13973948,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/ethscriptions-ordinals-arrive-on-ethereum,1687176000,'Ethscriptions' Ordinals Arrive On Ethereum,"Ethereum users are being given a fresh way to create nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets on the blockchain following the launch of a new protocol called ""Ethscriptions."" Launched on June 17 by music website Genius.com's co-founder Tom Lehman, Ethscriptions aims to revolutionize Ethereum-based digital asset creation and was quickly met with a high degree of enthusiasm, generating almost 30,000 Ethscriptions within the first 18 hours. Taking inspiration from the popular Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals protocol — where assets are known as “inscriptions” — Ethscriptions promises to enhance the way digital assets are minted on the Ethereum network. The Protocol: Leveraging Ethereum's Calldata for Improved Minting Lehman, who is also known by the pseudonym Middlemarch on Twitter, declared the project a ""huge success."" Ethscriptions employs Ethereum's ""calldata,"" which refers to the data held within a smart contract, to allow for a ""cheaper"" and ""more decentralized"" minting process compared to conventional smart contract-based methods. At present, the protocol limits users to image-only inscriptions, but Lehman assures that Ethscriptions will accommodate different file types in the future. Current protocol specifications permit users to ""ethscribe"" any image provided it's less than 96 kilobytes in size. Lehman’s first project on the Ethscriptions protocol, the ""Ethereum Punks,"" witnessed a significantly positive response from the community. All 10,000 assets were claimed almost instantaneously, reinforcing the positive acceptance of the protocol by the community. Challenges and Potential: Navigating the Ethereum Ecosystem Despite the initial success, the project's launch caused so much user activity that the API interface for the official Ethscriptions website temporarily crashed, indicating possible infrastructure challenges. Given the existing infrastructure that enables the creation of NFTs and other digital assets on the Ethereum network, it remains uncertain whether Ethscriptions will achieve the same level of popularity as Bitcoin Ordinals. Within six months, the total number of Ordinals inscribed on Bitcoin skyrocketed from zero to 10 million, driven primarily by users' fascination with minting assets and the novelty of minting entirely new tokens through the BRC-20 token standard on the Bitcoin network. The launch of the Ethscriptions protocol on Ethereum presents a significant development for digital asset creation on the blockchain. The Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and innovate, and it becomes clearer over this period that initiatives like Ethscriptions could potentially introduce new dynamics and possibilities. While the immediate impact is promising, the long-term success of this novel approach to asset creation remains to be seen. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Follow the Whale is a platform that will significantly contribute to the crypto space by analyzing data and predicting important updates in the market. A Game Changer for the Crypto Space Poliant, a yearly founded crypto project, has just developed and launched its main product, Follow the Whale (FTWP). Follow the Whale Pool is an exclusive platform developed with the main goal of analyzing terabytes of data per second in order to anticipate crucial information. Follow the Whale will be able to identify when a whale enters or exits the market of a cryptocurrency. The platform will achieve that by accessing large quantities of data in a very short time. The data will come from the market and exchanges in the form of data packages. By analyzing such data, Poliant and Follow the Whale aim to offer users valuable information, as well as provide additional information to AI (Artificial Intelligence) software, in order to help it act in the best way possible. Basically, Follow the Whale will have one job - to follow the whale’s signal. When a whale exit the market, the pool of Follow the Whale will go “Short”, while when a new whale enters the market, the system will go “Buy”. Thanks to this system, the team behind Follow the Whale can use whales’ market movements to generate rewards. Follow the Whale can indeed contribute to the well-functioning of the crypto space, considering that it anticipates some events that can truly affect the crypto market. Besides, Poliant’s focus on helping the AI industry can indeed increase the popularity of the crypto project and its main product, considering that artificial intelligence is fastly developing and gaining remarkable popularity with each day that passes. About Poliant Poliant is a private club developed for crypto users where entrepreneurs and freelancers can access and exchange know-how through various products and services. In other words, Poliant aims to become a common space where users can meet and discuss various crypto-related subjects and not only. Besides, Poliant aims to allow users to access exclusive services and products only available to those who registered on the platform and constantly contribute to its development. Poliant launched recently and describes itself as a Ce-DeFi Club (Centralized-Decentralized Club). The centralized part of the project is linked to various companies that can check concepts such as KYC and AML procedures, software integration, token issuing, and others. On the other hand, the decentralized part of Poliant is correlated with token liquidity, POLI, xPOLI, rewards, management, and voting. Thus, Poliant users can contribute to the platform's processes by submitting their votes in the “DAO Voting” section. Poliant is a user-centered and user-friendly platform that is constantly focusing on growing its community and maintaining its users incentivized and intrigued by the concepts developed by the team. When it comes to its users, Poliant is working to provide a unique opportunity for crypto enthusiasts by allowing them to be part of the digital economy and earn various rewards for doing so. Stay Tuned To learn more about Poliant, Follow the Whale, and the latest updates of the crypto project, do not hesitate to access the official Poliant website.

Bitcoin is the life raft that provides unseizable wealth. How does one explain this monetary system? If an alien landed on earth and asked how the financial system worked, there is probably no economist who would be able to explain how such a complex and outlandish system actually functions. The heart of the world’s financial system is arguably the United States, and the Federal Reserve Bank. A bank that isn’t federal and has no reserves. In fact, the Federal Reserve is a private bank, with all the big US banks helping to run it and being among the shareholders. The alien might ask how on earth, or even in the galaxy, can a private bank run the financial affairs of the most powerful country in the world, and in turn influence the entire global monetary and banking system? The answer might be that it just kind of happened. Edward Griffin's “The creature from Jekyll Island” does the best job in telling the story of how a group of extremely powerful bankers and politicians travelled to a little frequented destination and held a secret meeting on setting up a central bank with which to control the country’s money. They were successful beyond belief and the bank endures to this day, with the world’s financial markets completely in thrall whenever the Chairman of the Federal Reserve makes his utterances on what the central bank will do next. How has the system endured? Some might say that what it has already done is enough, as when President Nixon announced back in 1971 that the dollar would be removed from its gold backing, allowing the country to print currency with almost no restraint ever since then. The alien could then ask how the dollar was able to keep its purchasing power, to say nothing of all the world’s fiat currencies which were tied to it. Also, hard assets such as gold - wouldn’t they rocket to the heavens? The answer would be that the dollar has lost 99% of its purchasing power since it was established in 1914, just after the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank. Gold has kept its purchasing power, as it has done throughout the history of the world and just continues to go up against the dollar despite the massive amount of manipulation that goes on in the paper futures exchanges such as the COMEX. Finally the alien may ask how the population of the US and that of other countries hasn’t risen up to protest the theft of purchasing power by the banks? The answer would be that the population is kept from discussing or hearing about how the financial system works, and this dearth of knowledge is throughout schools, colleges, and universities. How the story ends well However, the good news that could be told to the alien is that a decentralised hard money system has managed to grow under the radar of those in charge of the monetary system. It has spread across the world to become the most powerful and secure computer network that the world has ever seen. Its name is Bitcoin, and it provides wealth that cannot be taken away from the holder, not by force, nor by manipulation of central banks that drive the world’s middle classes into poverty. This is a story that can end well, and will perhaps leave the alien not feeling as sorry for us. Here is a world where an evil monetary system prevails, but where a gift in the form of Bitcoin can provide an exit out of the slavery that fiat currencies inflict.

Enabled through a partnership with ChainPort, KuCoin, BitGet, and other top-tier Web3 partners, ChainGPT has developed a decentralized bi-directional bridge between the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum for the $CGPT token. Now users will be able to transfer their $CGPT to and from the ETH and BNB/BSC networks seamlessly. With the implementation of the bridge, the $CGPT token’s on-chain presence expands, gaining access to the robust and vibrant ecology of the Ethereum network. Integrations into many of the world's leading DEFI protocols, the opening of token pools on DEXs, and the provision of added trading pairs against a broader segment of popular tokens becomes possible. What is $CGPT? At its core, $CGPT is enabling a decentralized economy for AI services. As the native token of the ChainGPT ecosystem, $CGPT serves the dual functions of a utility and governance tool. Its utility purpose is to provide access to a full suite of AI-powered Web3 tooling from NFT minting and community management to smart contract auditing and creation to launchpad tiering and beyond. Its governance function relates to the role of $CGPT in distributing ownership rights over the platform throughout its community members and giving them the opportunity to help steer the direction of the project’s development. View the ChainGPT DAO here. Where will the ERC-20 version of $CGPT be supported? ChainGPT has been in communications with a multitude of exchanges that would be able to provide support immediately after instantiation. At this time, Kucoin, BitGet, and ByBit have confirmed support with a few select other major exchanges signaling their willingness. On the front of decentralized venues for support, the most popular DEX in the world, UniSwap, will have a $CGPT token pool opened to provide instant listing and liquidity on Ethereum. With the help of ChainPort, $CGPT’s presence on major crypto directories and analytics portals including CoinGecko and Etherscan has been expedited.

The AMF takes a stab at defining DeFi, the decentralized governance systems known as DAOs and the automated ""smart contracts"" that run transactions. The paper also raises associated risks and levels of control for debate.  ""Due to the cross‐border nature and reach of DeFi activities, the AMF also supports the development of a global coordinated approach towards regulation to ensure a global level‐playing field, which should both aim to protect investors and foster innovation,"" the paper said.  At a meeting with reporters in May, AMF Secretary General Benoit de Juvigny flagged the paper as a contribution to EU policy development on DeFi, while noting that it will prove “complicated” to categorize participants, unlike those found in conventional finance.  Global standard-setters like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) are also looking to set up standards for the DeFi sector, with a working group for international securities regulator IOSCO set to publish recommendations by the end of the year.  ""The AMF fully supports these initiatives, and intends to increase its engagement with stakeholders, both public and private, with a view to allow the emergence of a balanced regulatory framework that will help support the sound development of decentralized finance in the long run,"" the paper said.  While jurisdictions are increasingly regulating centralized crypto exchanges, DeFi protocols are a challenge to supervise thanks to an apparent lack of an specific entity to target for compliance.  Industry stakeholders are invited to contribute to the AMF's proposed discussion points until Sept. 30.

A possible cup and handle is a long time in the making, with the cup starting in June of 2022, coming to a top last April, and now making its handle downwards. The measured move for this cup and handle could be in the region of $45,000. On the 5-day time frame the price is holding nicely at the top of the Gaussian Channel, and on the weekly time frame the Stochastic RSI, a good momentum indicator, is coming down nicely, to be followed by a cross up perhaps in the next 2 to 3 weeks. Of course, everything isn’t just going to be upwards. Bitcoin may well sweep lower and test the support at $24,260 where it can also find trend line support plus the middle of the Gaussian Channel on the weekly time frame. Should all the above be wrong then a far more extensive bear market would come into play. Whatever happens, bitcoin is hard money you can own, spend and save without any government or bank say-so.

13969264,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538451,1687164931,"Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: Why Arbitrum, Optimism Will Profit Massively","The tentatively slated Ethereum upgrade Cancun / Deneb for autumn will be a game-changer for layer-2 rollup technologies such as Arbitrum and Optimism. The basis for this will be the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which will be the main code change of the upgrade, as Christine Kim, vice president in Galaxy Digital’s research team explained. Last Friday, 15 June, the 111th All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call was held. Chaired by Ethereum Foundation Researcher Alex Stokes, participants finalized the final scope of the upgrade. And EIP 4844 (proto-thanksharding) is being implemented. Ethereum: Next Upgrade Is Huge For ARB And OP As Kim writes, EIP 4844 introduces a new transaction type called “blobs”. This increases the data and storage requirements of Ethereum blocks and creates a new fee market to value blobs separately from regular transactions. Data blobs are the first milestone for Ethereum’s full Danksharding, which will allow rollups such as Arbitrum and Optimism a 100-fold increase in capacity. This is realized by allowing nodes to safely process multiple blobs per block than the initial maximum set by EIP 4844. Importantly, EIP 4844 does not improve Ethereum’s scalability as a general-purpose blockchain for executing transactions and smart contracts, Kim notes. It does not significantly increase or improve the transaction capacity of Ethereum itself. Related Reading: XRP Allegedly Attacked By SEC’s Hinman For Ethereum’s Benefit However, proto-Danksharding reduces the cost of transferring large amounts of data to Ethereum and thus lowers the operating costs of rollups. This is of equal importance, as recent years have seen a surge in transactional activity from rollups such as Arbitrum and Optimism. While Ethereum mainnet transactions per second (TPS) reached a maximum of 20 TPS this year, L2 TPS peaked above 50. Compared to the cost of deploying code and transactions directly on Ethereum, rollups have saved end users and dapp developers over 99% in gas fees. The goal of EIP 4844 is therefore of great importance for scaling Ethereum. Related Reading: Ethereum Plunges Below $1,700, Here’s The Metric That Signaled This In Advance “Blob blockspace will be auctioned according to its own fee market, modeled after the fee market design of EIP 1559,” says Kim who emphasizes that there are many parallels to the introduction of blobs on Ethereum and the introduction of segregated witness (segwit) on Bitcoin. However, one of the main differences between segwit and EIP 4844 is the expected long-term impact of these code changes. Arbitrum (ARB) Price At Crucial Resistance In recent weeks, ARB has shown relative strength compared to OP. The ARB price has swept the previous low and now needs to overcome resistance at $1.03 to enter the trading range from May 6 to June 10. If the ARB price fails to do so in the next few days, a price discovery to the downside could be imminent. Otherwise, a rise to mid-range resistance at $1.15 could be on the table.

These regulatory actions have had a profound impact on the cryptocurrency market, stifling any potential upward momentum. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) retested its lowest point in two months, plummeting to $24,000 at the time of the filing. While BNB also endured the repercussions of the regulatory pressure, it managed to find some stability around the $220 support level.

42420213,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaALV,1687161167,Hinman Documents Release in SEC-Ripple Case Is a Boost to Ether: JPMorgan,"The release of the Hinman papers last week in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case against Ripple is a boost to ether (ETH), and is likely to trigger a move to more decentralization in the crypto market, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Thursday.  Emails tied to former Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman’s 2018 speech saying ether did not look like a security were published last Tuesday by Ripple in its defense against an SEC lawsuit.  Senior leadership at the SEC did not rank ether as a security in 2018, the report noted, and SEC officials acknowledged that the “fact that tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network are no longer securities creates a regulatory gap.”  “The speech acknowledges that there is an other category,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote, adding that “it is not a security because there is no controlling group (at least in the Howey sense) yet there may be a need for regulation to protect purchasers.”  Panigirtzoglou was referring to the Howey Test, which is used to determine which transactions qualify as investment contracts and thus subject to U.S. securities laws. An asset can be classed as a security if there is an investment of money in a common enterprise and the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.  JPMorgan says these revelations could explain why the regulator has not taken action against ether while targeting other crypto tokens this year.  “The Hinman documents are likely to influence the direction of the current U.S. congressional effort to regulate the crypto industry in a way that ether would avoid being designated as a security,” the analysts wrote.  The easiest solution for Congress would be to put ether in the same category as bitcoin (BTC), and regulate it as a commodity under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  A new “other category” could be introduced specific to ether and other cryptocurrencies that are decentralized enough to avoid being classed as securities, the bank said, adding that the “more decentralized a cryptocurrency is the higher its chance that it would avoid being designated as a security.”  The Hinman documents will probably intensify the race among major cryptocurrencies to become more decentralized and look more like ether, the report said.

Donations to ZachXBT have poured in from across the crypto community and have crossed over $1 million so far to help fund his legal defense. Donations Pour In Following the disclosure of the lawsuit, the blockchain sleuth posted a digital wallet address on his official Twitter handle, along with details of the lawsuit filed against him by Jeffrey Huang. Huang is a Taiwanese-American musician and tech entrepreneur. ZachXBT described the lawsuit as troubling and called it a “David and Goliath” story. “It’s unfortunate I have to make this thread, but I am being sued by MachiBigBrother for an article I published in June 2022. Today Machi filed a defamation lawsuit. The lawsuit is baseless and an attempt to chill free speech. I intend to fight back & defend free speech.” ZachXBT noted that his legal expenses could cost more than $1 million. However, in an example of how tight-knit the crypto community is, donations poured in, and within a day, ZachXBT’s donation wallet accumulated digital assets worth beyond the stated goal. According to Nansen Portfolio, a majority of donations primarily consisted of stablecoins. ZachXBT added that any leftover funds would be returned back to the donors on a pro-rata basis. “I am creating a donation address to assist with legal costs associated with the defense of this matter, which could easily exceed $1m USD. All leftover funds will be returned on a pro-rata basis to contributors.” Currently, the wallet contains over $650,000 worth of USDC, $274,000 worth of Tether, and several other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC). Prominent Names Step In To Help Several users from a number of cryptocurrency exchanges also donated towards the effort, with ZachXBT’s donation wallet receiving funds from wallets linked to all major exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, OKX, Coinbase, Bitfinex, Bybit, 1inch, and Uniswap. Donations under the $100 mark number in the thousands, while several donations are between $10,000 and $50,000, as several prominent members from the crypto ecosystem also chipped in. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also made a donation of $50,000, urging ZachXBT to keep up the fight and help keep crypto transparent. The donation from Zhao comes even as the Binance CEO is himself grappling with a lawsuit filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun also donated $10,000 worth of the True USD stablecoin. Sun also highlighted ZachXBT’s role in educating the crypto community, stating, “I’m pleased to pledge a donation of 10k #TUSD to @zachxbt. Despite not being a legal expert myself, I highly value Zach’s substantial contributions to blockchain security and his crucial role in guiding our users to safeguard their funds.” The Lawsuit Against ZachXBT ZachXBT was sued by NFT trader MachiBigBrother, also called Jeffrey Huang. ZachXBT had published a report about Huang last year, alleging that he had embezzled millions of dollars worth of crypto. MachiBigBrother filed the lawsuit against the blockchain sleuth in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleging that ZachXBT’s report caused serious monetary and reputational harm. The lawyer representing MachiBigBrother stated, “Without any regard for the ruinous effect that public allegations of criminal conduct can produce for the accused individual, [ZachXBT] not only proceeded to publish his defamatory article on Medium.com, he also maliciously promoted the article to his more than 300,000 Twitter followers.” ZachXBT faces one count of libel and one count of libel per se. The lawsuit also requests that the court order ZachXBT to pay actual and compensatory damages in addition to exemplary damages, the amount of which will be determined by the court. ZachXBT has emerged as one of the most prominent voices in the crypto space and has shone a light on several crypto projects and on-chain events. In the process, he has uncovered several potential scams and bad actors and studied exploits and hacks to find out their root causes. His detective work has also led to several real-world arrests and helped him amass a significant following, along with a place on the Consensus Magazine’s Most Influential 2022 list. However, the lawsuit has threatened to compromise ZachXBT’s identity after his name and place of residence were revealed. However, as the lawsuit progresses, the crypto and Web3 communities have come out in complete support through their donations. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Twitter even suspended another automated bot called @AskTheWassie, a comic frog that operated similarly to @ExplainThisBob on Sunday.  “Promotion of scams under the guise of being a funny/helpful bot will result in suspension. Doesn’t matter how much you pay us,” Musk tweeted.  Data shows BOB prices quickly fell from $0.000031 to $0.000016 on Sunday as traders likely reacted to Twitter’s actions, reaching a market capitalization of $13 million. As such, the tokens have been in a nearly continuous slide since early May, when they reached a peak capitalization of $74 million.  The automated @ExplainThisBob account quickly went viral on Twitter in late April for its witty summaries and comedic responses to tweets. Musk once replied “I love bob” to an @ExplainThisBob in April, aiding a quick price surge at the time.  Musk has since engaged several times with the Bob bot. He tweeted as recently as June that “Once again, Bob nails it,” in response to a political discussion.

Data from the on-chain analytics tool Nansen show ZachXBT received USD Coin (USDC), tether (USDT), dai (DAI) – and even memecoins such as JESUS and PEPE – from hundreds of wallets.  Backers include crypto exchanges Binance, security firm CertiK, and Tron creator Justin Sun, among others. Most of these funds were received on the Ethereum blockchain, with smaller amounts sent from Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Optimism, Polygon and Fantom based tokens.  ZachXBT has moved the funds to another address as of Monday morning, the blockchain data shows.  NFT trader MachiBigBrother, otherwise known as Jeffrey Huang, last week sued ZachXBT, an independent blockchain detective, after the on-chain sleuth published a report last year alleging Huang embezzled tens of millions of dollars worth of crypto.  The lawsuit, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleges ZachXBT defamed MachiBigBrother, ""inflict[ing] serious reputational and monetary harm” on him. ZachXBT faces one count of libel and one count of libel per se, according to the complaint.

Bitcoin is beginning the trading week in Asia down 0.5% to $26,366, while ether is down 0.2% to $1,724.  The trading week was fairly flat for the two largest digital assets, as during the past seven days, bitcoin was up 1.6% while ether was down 1.7%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was slightly in the red.  “With Fed having left interest rates unchanged, the environment appears supportive for crypto assets to start rallying again,” Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, said in a note to CoinDesk. “However, the Fed went ahead to add that rate cuts were not on the horizon in the near-term, which saw the market struggling.”  Bitcoin and majors have held relatively well, says DiPasquale, arguing that this is a favorable accumulation opportunity for the mid to long-term.  “For now, however, all eyes are going to be on Bitcoin, especially as its dominance has been on the rise due to selling pressure in altcoins,” he said. “As long as the market leader maintains the range between $20k - $22k, bulls shouldn’t be overly concerned.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB +3.5% Currency XRP XRP +1.5% Currency Polkadot DOT +0.3% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cosmos ATOM −3.8% Smart Contract Platform Loopring LRC −2.7% Smart Contract Platform Terra LUNA −2.6% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Indonesia’s Approved List of Crypto Tokens Has Plenty of Junk – and Possible Securities  One of the stories that was missed during the last week was an updated list from the Indonesian Commodities Bureau (BAPPEBTI) that shows which digital assets are approved for trading in the country.  This isn’t the first time the regulator has done this. Last September, the regulator published its initial list, and now it's much more expansive.  But it's interesting now because of the timing.  So many of the tokens on the list would be considered securities in the U.S. Tokens named by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as securities, like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Decentraland (MANA) are on there. Tokens that wouldn’t pass Hong Kong’s quality test of high liquidity and a 12-month track record are on there.  Perhaps the message the regulator wanted to telegraph is that Indonesia is open to a wide variety of crypto trading – it just wants the capital gains tax from it.  It gets that sought-after tax by taking a light touch on the quality of trading by allowing quantity. Lots of Hong Kongers were burned on the collapse of FTX, which is why the regulator there has an eye on quality control. Indonesia is more set on capturing tax revenue as its middle class grows, something it has had trouble doing with its large informal economy.  The concerns are just different in Indonesia. There are also plenty of tokens on the list that wouldn’t cut it in Thailand, like PEPE and Floki – where the regulator has banned meme tokens. There’s not a demand for a flight to quality with regulated crypto in this country.  But isn't that a core tenant of a free-market economy? Why is the government in the best position to pick your crypto?
