This activity was brought to light by the on-chain data tracker Santiment which showed unusual activity in dormant ADA wallets after the price crossed $0.3. Cardano Sharks And Whale Start Moving Coins In the report that was posted on X (formerly Twitter) by the on-chain data tracker, Cardano shark and whale addresses (that is addresses holding between 100,000 and 10 million ADA on their balances), as well as old coins, have been showing a lot of activity. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Nosedives Following 7,700% Jump, What Happened? Most of this activity could be detrimental to the current ADA recovery given that these large holders have been moving their previously dormant coins. The Santiment report shows that old ADA coins are moving back into circulation once more. Source: Santiment on X It showed that the crypto just marked its largest day of old coins being moved around. The last time that this metric was this high, as pointed out by the tracker, was back in April 2022, and historical performance does not spell good news following this. ADA price loses footing at $3 | Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com What Happened To ADA Price Last Time? Back in April 2022 when a similar volume of old coins began moving back into circulation, it spelled doom for the ADA price. Looking at the chart in 2022 shows that ADA had finished out the month of March strong at a price of $1.21. However, once these coins began moving, it was game over. April 2022 saw the ADA price fall from $1.21 to $0.8 before the month was over, meaning a 33% drop in price. The downtrend would carry on into the later part of the year and by December 2022, the ADA price had fallen as low as $0.24. Related Reading: The End Is Near For Trellor (TRB): Crypto Analyst Says Prepare For 50% Drop If this were to repeat itself, then another 30% drop would send the ADA price below $0.1 in the coming month. This would take the price back to September 2020 levels. However, it is not all bad news for the digital asset given the activity of sharks and whales. In the same report, Sentiment revealed that Cardano sharks and whales have been buying up ADA rapidly. They had bought a total of 43.71 million ADA in the space of two weeks, now worth more than $131 million at the current price. This suggests bearish sentiment is limited given that large addresses are still accumulating coins. At this rate, whatever is being dumped on the open market by the dormant wallets will be picked up by the sharks and whales. As long as demand continues to match supply, then the sell-off could have next to a negligible effect on the price of ADA.

19664470,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558465,1698789645,Bitcoin’s Price Tide: Could ASIC Miner Values Signal An Approaching Crypto Surge?,"Adam Back, the co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, has recently drawn attention to a notable correlation, which is that the prices of ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners tend to align with Bitcoin prices. This parallel trend has been confirmed historically, with the miners peaking in price during the 2021 Bitcoin bull run, just as BTC reached its peak of $69,000. Back’s analysis shows that even as the market navigates through changing tides, the fate of mining equipment is an important piece of the puzzle for understanding the overall ecosystem. The CEO of Blockstream also suggests that the price of ASIC miners is not just a reflection of manufacturing costs or technological advancements but also an indicator of market sentiment toward Bitcoin itself. Related Reading: The Hidden Signals: Bitcoin’s On-Chain Data Points To Bullish Outlook, But There’s A Catch The Miners’ Market: A Reflection Of Bitcoin’s Value According to Back in a video posted on X (formerly known as Twitter), during the prelude to the 2021 bull market, the price of ASIC miners was low, mirroring the anticipation and optimism of the Bitcoin community for a significant rally. However, as Bitcoin’s value skyrocketed, so did the price for these mining machines, hitting a peak of $120/Terrahash (TH) alongside Bitcoin’s all-time high. Yet, with the subsequent decline in BTC value, the demand and price for ASIC miners plummeted, currently trading hands at under $15/TH—a stark contrast to their previous highs. Despite a positive momentum for Bitcoin this year, ASIC miner prices have remained subdued. However, Back maintains an optimistic outlook for a potential resurgence in ASIC miner prices. Historically there’s been a high correlation between ASIC miner and #Bitcoin prices. Learn how the new the Blockstream ASIC (BASIC) Note investment opportunity capitalizes on this thesis. Blockstream CEO Dr. @adam3us explains: pic.twitter.com/zHAqhLsGet — Blockstream (@Blockstream) October 31, 2023 The CEO of Blockstream suggests that as Bitcoin enters deeper into a bull phase, the value of these essential mining components is likely to increase. Back points to the upcoming Bitcoin Halving — an event that historically impacts Bitcoin’s price due to the reduced rate at which new Bitcoins are generated — as a possible catalyst for Bitcoin’s price surge and a parallel rise in ASIC miner values. Bitcoin Path To Reclaim $35,000 Despite several predictions and analyses about Bitcoin, the top crypto has continued to move at its own pace. After retracing from the previously tapped $35,000, the asset has begun to thrive to reclaim that price zone. Currently, the asset trades at $34,269, down by 1.1% in the past 24 hours. However, looking at its weekly performance, Bitcoin still appears to be in gains. Though it has dropped by 0.7% in the past 7 days, it is still up by 20% in the past two weeks. Back mentioned that the Bitcoin Halving appears as a significant milestone that could precede a notable increase in Bitcoin’s price, typically starting around six months post-halving. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Stellar Surge: What’s Next? Expert Deciphers The Crypto Labyrinth While the CEO of Blockstream hesitates to make a definitive prediction about the exact outcome this time, he remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s prospects, positing that the cryptocurrency could still grow further this year or next year.

42419267,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE7or,1698787204,"As Sam Bankman-Fried Fraud Trial Nears Close, a Terse Judge Sets Jury Instructions","NEW YORK – Sam Bankman-Fried's criminal fraud trial is entering the home stretch, with federal judge Lewis Kaplan set to explain to jurors how the law applies to the seven charges against the FTX founder.  Both the Department of Justice and the defense team rested their respective cases on Tuesday after the one-time crypto exchange heavyweight completed his testimony. If convicted on all counts, Bankman-Fried could spend decades in prison (and theoretically up to 115 years).  His trial, which kicked off at the beginning of October, now moves into a new phase, one more focused on the jury specifically rather than the evidence.  This began Tuesday afternoon, when the parties discussed the proposed jury instructions drafted by the judge. While Judge Kaplan didn't quite lose his patience immediately, he soon found himself asking the various attorneys to explain their arguments clearly and quickly.  Early on, the question of what laws govern FTX's terms of service – and the instructions surrounding these terms – came up.  ""In our view, the legal terms are significant,"" defense attorney S. Gale Dick told the court.  As usual, Judge Kaplan sounded unimpressed by the defense argument, which Bankman-Fried's team had made before (including late Monday night). In short, the defense team has tried to argue that the terms of service are governed by English law, and therefore the jury should be instructed on it.  ""I apply the law of New York,"" the judge said.  Tuesday's charge conference sometimes saw the lawyers debate just one or two words in a sentence of the 60-something page document, arguing those words would change the meaning of the charge presented.  The prosecution got an early win when the judge ruled that he would instruct the jury that they should find Bankman-Fried guilty of one count of wire fraud if they find there was either misrepresentation or misappropriation in how he marketed FTX to customers.  On another part, a ""conscious-avoidance charge,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Thane Rehn argued that Bankman-Fried tried to avoid direct knowledge of some of the problems at FTX and its sibling company Alameda Research, pointing to the defendant's testimony from earlier in the day.

42419300,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9sr,1698786034,"Bitcoin Saw 27% October Surge as Traders 'Panic Bought' Amid Bitcoin ETF Enthusiasm. Is $40,000 Next?","BTC has advanced 27% in October, its strongest showing since January, as the crypto rally widened.  Sentiment hit an ""exuberant"" level as many traders ""panic bought"" amid the rally, Matrixport noted.  BTC could still run higher, targeting $40,000 in the coming weeks, an LMAX strategist said.  The boredom ended in October as cryptocurrency prices zoomed higher, with the biggest of them all, bitcoin [BTC], posting the strongest monthly rally since January as investors were abuzz with optimism that bitcoin ETFs will soon get approved in the U.S.  BTC gained more than 27%, springing to a 17-month high of $35,000 after hovering around the $27,000 level during the first half of October. It has recently resided just above $34,000 ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday, with market participants largely expecting policymakers to leave rates unchanged.  The rally spread across the broader crypto market, a bullish sign, The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], which tracks a broad basket of tokens, advanced 22% in October. The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies jumped nearly 19% to $1.255 trillion, according to TradingView data, the biggest increase in crypto wealth since the 33% jump in January.  ETFs would be a big deal for bitcoin because they're far easier for the average investor to buy than the cryptocurrency itself or existing bitcoin investment products, like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) with $21 billion assets under management. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected GBTC's conversion into one, but courts have eviscerated that decision, boosting the odds the SEC will have to approve that shift – and likely also bless ETF applications from the likes of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.  Despite the fact that it was a broad crypto rally in October, not all sectors benefited equally.  The CoinDesk DeFi Index [DCF], which encompasses tokens related to the decentralized finance sector such as decentralized exchanges, lending and staking protocols, gained only 7% in October. Key DeFi tokens such as curve [CRV], maker [MKR], uniswap [UNI] and compound [COMP] declined 3% to 7%.  Ethereum's ether [ETH] posted a modest gain of 7%. Its valuation sank to a level versus BTC that was also seen in June 2022, which preceded ETH outperformance.  Meanwhile, the CoinDesk Computing Sector [CPU], an index that tracks protocols focused on building and supporting Web3 infrastructure and distributed computing, jumped almost 32% in October.  Among alternative cryptocurrencies, solana [SOL] was a notable outperformer with over 70% monthly return amid increasing network activity and subsiding concerns about FTX dumping tokens in a fire-sale.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Started Buying Solana's SOL at 20 Cents Using 'Alameda Profits,' He Says at His Trial  Why did cryptocurrencies rally in October?  Investors are excited about the potential for bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.  ""A spot bitcoin ETF could bring in as much as $50 billion to $100 billion in inflows over the next five years"" and ""could have an outsize impact on the price of bitcoin,"" Ryan Rasmussen, analyst at asset manager Bitwise, said Tuesday in an interview with CoinDesk TV.  He said he expects the SEC to green light ETF applications as soon as December, before the holidays. Bitwise is one of the firms that wants to list one.  Crypto investment services firm Matrixport said that elevated funding rates on the BTC derivatives market suggest that many traders ""panic bought"" on the way up in a fear of missing out of the rally.  On top of the ETF hype, sector specific momentum, short liquidations and macroeconomic headwinds also contributed to the price increase, crypto analytics firm CoinMetrics said in a report Tuesday.  ""This market movement suggests renewed confidence and indicates a potential shift in the dynamics around digital asset markets,"" CoinMetrics analyst Tanay Ved said.  Highlighting a shifting sentiment, investment legend Stanley Druckenmiller said at a Robin Hood fireside chat Monday with hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones that he ""likes"" bitcoin and gold as an investment and store of value asset. He said he owns gold because it's a ""5,000-year-old brand,"" but young people prefer to own BTC because it's ""easier to do stuff with.""  ""I don't own any bitcoin, but to be frank, I should,"" he added.  What's next for bitcoin (BTC) price?  After its blockbuster month, bitcoin hasn't run out of steam and could run further, analysts suggested.  ""The October breakout to a fresh yearly high has opened the door for this next major upside extension, targeting a measured move objective in the $40,000 area over the coming weeks,"" Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in an email.  Matrixport analysts noted that the firm's Bitcoin Greed & Fear Index sits at 97%, signaling ""exuberant"" sentiment. Still, they argued that BTC is likely to ""squeeze higher and could target $40,000 as the next significant resistance level.""",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/31/bitcoin-saw-27-october-surge-as-traders-panic-bought-amid-bitcoin-etf-enthusiasm-is-40000-next,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03fc01ee6d9061b08c8f24b6bcbe4f011705ff58-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
19662956,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558476,1698786020,"FTX Transfers $150M In Assets, Including Ethereum And Solana, Amid Bankruptcy","Blockchain analytics firm Nansen has recently revealed that wallets associated with bankrupt crypto exchange FTX have transferred approximately $156 million worth of digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), in a series of transactions over the past week. The movement of these funds has raised concerns and attracted the attention of industry experts and investors. Nansen’s report sheds light on the ongoing transfers and provides valuable insights into the extent of FTX’s asset movements. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETF: Here’s The Magic Number To Push BTC Past $40,000 Bankrupt FTX Wallets Unstake $57 Million Worth Of SOL Tokens According to the Nansen report, funds from FTX wallets have continued to migrate to various exchanges since the previous update. The report specifies the following notable transactions: 695,000 Perpetual Protocol (PERP) tokens worth $423,000 767,000 Biconomy (BICO) tokens worth $182,000 833,000 Kyber Network (KNC) tokens worth $616,000 108 million TrueFI (TRU) tokens worth $420,000 138,000 Band (BAND) tokens worth $221,000 2.5 million Graph (GRT) tokens worth $273,000 845 Maker (MKR) tokens worth $1.17 million 7.16 million Render (RNDR) tokens worth $17.8 million 10.5 million USD Coin (USDC) 23,000 Polygon (MATIC) tokens worth $15,000 9.5 million Ren (REN) tokens worth $500,000 1.1 million ETH tokens worth $2 million Additionally, the report highlights that an additional 1.6 million SOL tokens worth $57.6 million have initiated the unstaking process. While these funds have not yet left the associated wallet, their potential movement would bring the total SOL tokens moved by FTX to just under $90 million. Moreover, considering the unstaking of SOL and the new assets transferred by FTX to Coinbase and Binance, the total value of funds moved by FTX now stands at $156 million. Major Transfers Of LINK, AAVE, And MKR Unveiled Nansen’s previous investigation revealed significant transfers from wallets linked to FTX and Alameda Research, FTX’s trading arm. These funds were initially withdrawn from FTX and Alameda wallets before being sent to intermediary wallets and eventually deposited into Binance and Coinbase. The report discloses the following noteworthy movements: 2.2 million USD worth of Chainlink (LINK) tokens 1 million USD worth of Aave (AAVE) tokens 2 million USD worth of MKR tokens 3.4 million USD worth of ETH tokens In addition to these transfers, Nansen discovered that 943,000 SOL tokens, equivalent to approximately $32 million, were moved from the FTX Cold Storage wallet. Related Reading: Trader Who Bought Dogecoin In 2017 Maps Out Meteoric 37500% Rise To $26 Overall, the recent findings by Nansen regarding the movement of funds from wallets associated with the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX have sparked concerns within the cryptocurrency community. The report highlights substantial transfers of various digital assets, including ETH and SOL, and provides insight into the scale of FTX’s asset movements. As of the current market conditions, FTX’s native token, FTT, is trading at $1.23. Despite a false breakout on October 23, where the token briefly surpassed $1,360, it has since declined consistently. However, over the past 30 days, FTT has maintained a profit margin of 3.7%, signifying relative stability within this time frame.

19661469,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558435,1698782450,Top 5 Bitcoin-Like Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In The Crypto Bull Run,"With every crypto bull market, there are always altcoins that take the path of Bitcoin and end up securing good profits for their holders. With the larger options like Bitcoin already big enough to the point that their potential for high upside is limited, here are 5 altcoins that could make a Bitcoin-like run in the next bull market. Arbitrum (ARB) Leads The Altcoins Arbitrum (ARB) is a token that was launched less than a year ago in the thick of the bear market and can be said to have done reasonably well since then. The altcoin is still trading under the $1 mark which makes it a prime mark to make a Bitcoin-like rally. Related Reading: Why This 70-Year-Old Billionaire Wants To Own Bitcoin It is also one of the altcoins that are backed by a full-fledged Ethereum Layer 2 network, making it possible for users to carry out transactions for cheap on the Ethereum network. This coin boasts a significant user base and could rally at least 10x in the bull market. Pepe Coin (PEPE) To Rally In The Crypto Bull Market Just like Arbitrum, Pepe Coin (PEPE) was launched this year at the height of the bull market but that didn’t stop it from making a splash. The coin went from under $500,000 market cap to over $1 billion in less than a month, which secured it the position of the third-largest meme coin in the space. PEPE’s price has since retraced with its market cap sitting below $500 million. But this makes it a prime time for picking up the token. In the last bull market, meme coins like Dogecoin crossed the $30 billion market cap mark and a rally to a $10 billion market cap for PEPE would be a 20x return already. Stellar (XLM) Goes The XRP Way Stellar’s (XLM) value proposition has always been in its similarities to the XRP ecosystem and its ability to be integrated as a payments system. The blockchain offers very fast and cheap transactions compared to the likes of Ethereum, making it a prime target for those who do not want to spend too much on fees. Related Reading: Solo Bitcoin Miner Snags $200,000 Block Reward, How Did They Do It? However, unlike XRP, the XLM price is still sitting at just $0.12 and its market cap is at a mere $3.2 billion. A return to its all-time high price of $0.9 would mean a 9x from here. But as far as bull markets go, previous all-time highs are often broken which could send XLM’s price flying. XLM price sitting at $1.2 | Source: XLMUSD on Tradingview.com Flow (FLOW) Joins The Altcoins List Of the altcoins listed here, Flow is one whose price trajectory could closely resemble that of Bitcoin or Ethereum. Flow is a Layer 1 Proof of Stake blockchain which makes it a competitor for Ethereum. The blockchain already established itself as a major player when it was announced to be the blockchain powering non-fungible tokens (NFT) on Instagram in 2022. If more large partnerships like these continue, then it is a no-brainer that FLOW crosses the $5 mark in the bull and this would be the low end of it. Nevertheless, a rise to $5 is already a 10x for investors from here, and could significantly be more. Trust Wallet Token (TWT) Presents Unique Opportunity With the major centralized exchange crashes that have happened over the last few years in the crypto space, self-custody has become an increasingly popular movement among crypto investors. Software wallet providers such as Trust Wallet Token (TWT) have already begun to enjoy this exodus from centralized exchanges and this is expected to continue. Related Reading: Time To Exit Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Predicts 75% Breakdown To $8,000 The TWT token is currently still at $1.06 with a market cap of $442 million, meaning there is still a lot of room to grow. As the adoption of self-custody grows, so will demand for wallets like Trust Wallet, and with demand comes higher token prices. And the cherry on the cake is that the software wallet is owned by Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world.

42419282,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9aH,1698782137,"15 Years After the Bitcoin White Paper, Bitcoin Builder Culture Flourishes","In the world of crypto, there is one document that is the Bible, Declaration of Independence and foundational blueprint for an entire industry: the Bitcoin white paper.  Authored by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto and released on Oct. 31, 2008, this revolutionary document marks its 15th anniversary today.  Today is not merely a milestone but a testament to the enduring importance of a decentralized future. As we celebrate this day in Bitcoin culture, it's worth reflecting on the significance of the white paper and its impact on the world.  The Bitcoin white paper, officially titled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,"" emerged following the global financial crisis of 2008, which left many disillusioned with traditional banking.  Nakamoto's vision was clear — to create a currency free from the shackles of governments, make it censorship-resistant and borderless. All solutions to the problems of then and the problems of now.  So Satoshi began – for two years before drafting the white paper its creator coded writing, ""I actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself.""  [Bitcoin] is synonymous with words like hope and freedom  In just nine short pages, the document outlined the blueprint of a decentralized ledger called the blockchain and introduced the concept of bitcoin as a currency. Its ingenious solution to the double-spend problem was to create a decentralized network of computers that would validate and record transactions in a public ledger, making it impossible to manipulate transactions.  Since 2008, Bitcoin has not only survived but thrived, becoming a global phenomenon and the best performing asset of the last decade. It sparked a wave of innovation within cryptocurrencies, it attracted and inspired people such as Vitalik Buterin and others to attempt at making more programmable protocols.  See also: Aubrey Strobel: The Art of Scarcity | Opinion  The currency has established itself as a store of value, digital gold and a hedge against inflation in some countries. Its scarcity, capped at 21 million coins, has drawn interest from all walks of life. It has differentiated itself much from the crypto space and is synonymous with words like hope and freedom.  While many are celebrating the arbitrary movement of time that has passed since the document was sent loose, today I want to reflect on how Satoshi could have known that we needed this invention and how to carry on his legacy.  Many of the same problems Satoshi set out to address remain current today. How can we move the mission of decentralized, permissionless money forward? How will we use the tools at our disposal to move the chain forward in the next 15 years? What problems can we solve?  The resurgence in Bitcoin Builder culture is palpable. You see it with Ordinals and other projects coming to the surface. How do we take Bitcoin to a billion people?  If cypherpunks are akin to participants of the Boston Tea Party, the Bitcoin white paper is the guiding light — a reminder for those challenging the times.

BlackRock's preparation to seed its iShares Bitcoin ETF has led to a surge in the price of Bitcoin. A U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETF could attract billions of dollars in investor inflows in its first few years. It's not a matter of if, but when. I'm talking, of course, about the long-awaited approval of a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence now estimate there's a 90% chance that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will give the go-ahead to such an investment product by January 10, 2024. Many presenters at last week's European Blockchain Convention ((EBC)) were even more optimistic, saying they believe a Bitcoin ETF will appear on the market by the end of this year. Mr. Market appears to agree. Responding to strong speculation that BlackRock, the world's largest investment management firm, is preparing to ""seed"" its iShares Bitcoin ETF this month with an unknown amount of capital in anticipation of its imminent approval, investors bid up the price of the digital asset this week to more than $35,000, a price we haven't seen in nearly a year and a half. That's roughly double what Bitcoin started the year at. For comparison's sake, Ether, the second largest digital token by market cap, is up around 50% year-to-date. U.S. Global Investors Investors Seeking Direct Access To Bitcoin Spot Bitcoin ETFs are already available to certain investors. Canada has had them for years. Europe launched its first one in August. But even when combined, Canada and Europe are dwarfed by the size of the U.S. stock market, which accounts for close to 60% of the total global equity market value. Of the top 10 largest investment management firms, only two-France's Credit Agricole and Germany's Allianz-are non-American. U.S. Global Investors To date, the only way for U.S. investors to get exposure to Bitcoin-besides buying the asset outright-is through futures, options and other derivatives. The largest of these products, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ), has been trading publicly since 2015 and currently has over $21 billion in assets under management ((AUM)). But trusts are unwieldy products compared to ETFs, which are traded on exchanges throughout the day and can be highly liquid. Plus, investors want access to spot Bitcoin prices, just as they have access to spot gold prices with physical gold-backed ETFs. Grayscale knows all of this, of course, which is why it's filed to convert GBTC to an ETF. And now, like BlackRock and a number of other firms that have also submitted applications for a Bitcoin ETF-they include Fidelity, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, VanEck and WisdomTree-Grayscale must play the waiting game at a time when many market experts are concerned that the U.S. could be falling behind other jurisdictions when it comes to Bitcoin investment, not to mention regulation. Some firms are choosing to act now. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest, which also has a Bitcoin ETF in the pipeline, has begun selling shares of GBTC in anticipation of its successful conversion into an ETF. Understanding The Impact Of A U.S. Spot ETF So what are the implications? Assuming for the moment that the SEC is in fact ready to give its blessing to a BlackRock-issued Bitcoin ETF, it's possible we may never see the token below $30,000 again. In such a scenario, the New York-based investment firm would likely become the world's largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, creating a potential supply crunch. Remember, Bitcoin production is capped at 21 million, and the ""halving""-when the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half-is coming up in around six months. The availability of a Bitcoin ETF would also finally herald the arrival of institutional investors. For many financial advisors, fiduciaries and others, Bitcoin is not an approved wealth management strategy. A spot ETF, on the other hand, would be. According to estimates made by blockchain and digital asset company Galaxy, a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETF would attract $14 billion in investor inflows in the first year alone. This would accelerate to $27 billion in the second year and, at the end of the third year following its launch, nearly $40 billion. This is only an estimate, and no one can predict the future with absolute certainty. But for speculators, accumulating Bitcoin now-before an ETF hits the U.S. market-may end up being a very profitable decision. Certainty In An Uncertain World I'm pleased to report that enthusiasm was very high at the ECB, held in beautiful Barcelona. It was the most well-attended event in the conference's history, with some 5,000 people in attendance-double the turnout from earlier this year. U.S. Global Investors Despite it being a blockchain/Web3/DeFi conference, Bitcoin was the $35,000 gorilla in the room. As a number of presenters said, the asset offers certainty in a highly uncertain world. This tracks with my recent comments that Bitcoin represents private property rights and, more broadly, human rights. With a spot ETF looking more and more likely, now could be an unprecedented opportunity to get exposure. Remember, however, to do your own due diligence and keep in mind that volatility is much greater than what you find in traditional investment instruments. For that reason, I recommend a weighting of no more than 2% of your total portfolio.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4645529-bitcoin-etfs-and-the-path-to-mainstream-adoption?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19660858.jpeg

42419288,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9fR,1698779473,U.S. SEC Messed Up in Handling Contentious Crypto Accounting Bulletin: GAO,"The Government Accountability Office issued a finding that the Securities and Exchange Commission was in the wrong when it didn't send SAB 121 to Congress, as it should with an official rule.  The SEC responded Tuesday that the conclusion only affects the guidance as interpreted under the Congressional Review Act and not the status of the bulletin itself.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was out of bounds when it issued its controversial ""Staff Accounting Bulletin 121,"" according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and Congress should have had a chance to review it.  The 2022 guidance, which the industry says threatens crypto investors' ability to find safe harbors for their assets, should have been treated as a formal rule, the GAO concluded in a report issued on Tuesday. The congressional watchdog is contending that, according to federal rulemaking procedures, the accounting bulletin should have gone through a different process, including submission to Congress before it went into effect. Still, that finding doesn't have any direct effect on the bulletin's ongoing status as technically nonbinding SEC policy, the agency indicated on Tuesday.  SAB 121 holds that financial firms that hold customers' crypto assets record those assets on their own balance sheets – requiring capital be maintained against them. The industry and Republican U.S. lawmakers have argued that it jeopardizes the willingness of regulated banks to act as crypto custodians, and it treats crypto holdings differently than other assets.  ""We find that the bulletin does meet the definition of a rule under [the Administrative Procedure Act] and that no exception applies,"" according to the finding of the GAO, an independent watchdog that works for the U.S. Congress. ""Thus, the bulletin is subject to [the Congressional Review Act’s] submission requirement.""  It’s likely that the bulletin will now be submitted for congressional review, though the details on the mechanics of that aren't yet clear. Once a new federal rule arrives in their hands, lawmakers are granted a window of opportunity to reject it under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).  ""The GAO opinion expresses its view that SAB 121 is a 'rule' for purposes of the CRA,"" the SEC said in a statement. ""The opinion does not otherwise affect the status of SAB 121.""  But people in the crypto industry took this legal upbraiding as another SEC setback.  ""Today, the GAO recognized SAB 121 for what it is: regulation under the guise of staff guidance,"" said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital Bank, in a statement. He said the bulletin ""makes it economically impossible for SEC-reporting banks – some of the most trusted financial institutions worldwide – to custody digital assets at scale.""  SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce had also previously objected to the commission's decision on the bulletin, saying it represented the SEC's ""scattershot and inefficient approach to crypto.""  The GAO noted the SEC argued that the accounting policy wasn't treated as a rule because it is not an “agency statement” of “future effect.” Rulemaking at a federal agency such as the SEC includes several steps. An idea must first be proposed and opened to multiple stages of public comment before it can be finalized and submitted to Congress. Then, the lawmakers have a chance to kill it.  ""This will be brought up for a vote of disapproval,"" Cody Carbone, vice president of policy for the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said in a posting on X. ""Each chamber of Congress now has until December 31 to pass a resolution of disapproval to invalidate the rule.""

19659950,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558463,1698778850,Expert Insights: 7 Altcoins Showing Promising Breakout Potential – A Must-Watch List,"In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, renowned crypto expert Miles Deutscher provided valuable insights into his weekly tokens and narrative watchlist, focusing on critical altcoins and upcoming events with significant trading potential. Altcoins Poised For Potential Breakout Deutscher’s analysis sheds light on several altcoins, including Solana (SOL), SingularityNET (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), Arkham (ARKM), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP. Solana: Deutscher emphasizes the importance of Solana’s Breakpoint 2023 conference and anticipates major announcements. While previous Breakpoints have resulted in “sell the news” events, Deutscher remains cautiously short on SOL. On the other hand, Miles expects a positive response from the community after the recent FTX collapse. However, historical patterns suggest the possibility of a sell-off, which warrants vigilance. Nonetheless, SOL has broken previous weekly records every week for the past month. Currently, SOL is trading at $36.27, a new record for 2023 and a level not seen since November 5, 2022. Moreover, SOL has seen significant gains of 4.4% over the past 24 hours, following its remarkable 57% rise over the past 30 days. AGIX, FET, OCEAN: The resurgence of the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative has sparked anticipation for a series of AI conferences, including OpenAI’s developer conference on November 6. Deutscher advises focusing on established leaders such as AGIX, FET, and OCEAN. Related Reading: Why This 70-Year-Old Billionaire Wants To Own Bitcoin These tokens have demonstrated strength during previous AI market surges. Deutscher suggests avoiding speculation on low-cap coins and opting for long positions on these altcoin AI leaders. Over the past 30 days, AGIX has seen a remarkable 19% increase in price. However, over the past 1 year, the token has seen a staggering 350% rise amidst the AI narrative hype. It is currently trading at $0.2284. On the same note, FET has surged over 329% over the 1 year and is currently trading at $0.3665. OCEAN has posted smaller gains over the 1 year, but has still recorded a significant 110% surge over this period and is currently trading at $0.3645. ARKM: According to Deutscher, although ARKM has received less attention than other altcoins, it is promising due to its involvement in AI-related businesses and its investment by Sam Altman. Deutscher highlights ARKM’s potential in the AI space, especially during the Solana conferences. This makes ARKM one of the altcoins to watch closely for potential trading opportunities, according to Deutscher. Currently, the crypto analytics and data tracking platform’s native token is trading at $0.3833, up 20% in the last fourteen days. XRP Speculation Intensifies Ahead Of Ripple’s ‘Swell Conference’ DOGE: While DOGE has seen a decline in price action and hype, Deutscher highlights two key factors that could influence its performance. First, DOGE Day, has historically attracted retail interest. Second, the potential for a Halloween tweet from Elon Musk, as was the case last year. Deutscher suggests that DOGE is best suited for spot trading and dollar cost averaging (DCA), as it remains an attractive option for retail investors and has the potential for a strong pump in the future. Related Reading: Can PEPE Build On Its 60% Rise? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says Currently, the Meme coin has lost its bullish momentum and has erased most of its gains over the past few days. Currently, the token is trading at $0.0686, down 1.9% in the past 24 hours and 42% in the 1-year time frame. Last but not least is XRP: With Ripple’s “Swell Conference” scheduled for November 8-9, Deutscher acknowledges the heavy speculation surrounding a potential initial public offering (IPO), although he believes it is unlikely. However, given the speculative nature of the crypto market, such speculation can fuel FOMO (fear of missing out) )-driven rallies. XRP has experienced pre-conference spikes, making it a token to watch this week and next. Currently, XRP is experiencing a sustained uptrend price action, gaining 2% in the past 24 hours, pushing the token to the 0.5949 level, which has not been seen since August.

Ethereum MVRV Ratio Has Surged Into The Danger Zone Recently In its latest insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about some underlying metrics related to ETH. First, the firm has pointed out how the trading volume of the cryptocurrency has gone down since Ethereum’s surge from a few days back. The value of the metric has been sharply going down recently | Source: Santiment The trading volume observing a significant decline while the price is trying to continue its rally could indicate that momentum is weakening for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Top Here? This Metric Would Say Otherwise One positive for the asset, though, could be the fact that the supply on exchanges has gone down since the rally started, implying that the investors have made net withdrawals. Looks like the metric has plunged | Source: Santiment Generally, investors transfer their Ethereum out of these central entities to hold onto it in self-custodial wallets for extended periods, so this decline in the supply on exchanges could be a sign of fresh accumulation. Following the latest rise in the asset, its social dominance has also seen a jump. The “social dominance” here refers to the mindshare that Ethereum occupies on social media platforms among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Interest around ETH has grown in the last few days | Source: Santiment It would appear that more eyes have been turning at Ethereum recently, which can be a sign that hype is building up among the traders. Historically, too much hype has been negative for the asset, as it has often led to top formations. So far, though, the social dominance is still notably below the levels it was at when ETH hit its local top at the start of this month, as is apparent in the above chart. According to Santiment, this “may suggest there can be some room for it to go before things cool down.” A signal that is more concretely bearish for Ethereum, however, is the 30-day MVRV ratio. In simple terms, what this ratio tells us is how the value that investors are holding (the market cap) compares against the capital that they invested into the asset (the realized cap). The indicator appears to have entered the danger zone | Source: Santiment Here, Santiment has used the 30-day MVRV ratio, which means this indicator only keeps track of the investors/addresses who bought their coins within the last 30 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Solid Above $34,000 Despite High Short-Term Holder Profit-Taking As shown in the chart, this Ethereum indicator has recently risen into a territory that the analytics firm labels as a “danger zone.” Historically, the price has seen a correction not too long after the metric has reached this zone so another local top may be due for Ethereum right now.

42419280,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9ZF,1698771695,The NFT Market Has Crashed. What Should Artists Do Now?,"In the wake of the NFT market's multi-year downturn, many artists who once thrived are now navigating a challenging and uncertain landscape. The NFT market had experienced exponential growth in recent years before it stumbled, leaving artists to question whether digital artwork is still a viable avenue for success.  However, amidst this uncertainty, there are opportunities for artists not only to endure but to thrive. As new technologies continue to emerge for the distribution of art, it is crucial for artists to focus on methods that enable them to promote and sell their work long-term, regardless of the state of any market.  David DeVore is the founder of Props, an NFT marketplace and minting development platform.  According to a recent survey by Artsy, a staggering 52% of respondents said they collect art to support artists, whereas 38% said they purchase art as an investment. This statistic highlights the enduring strength of artist communities and emphasizes the importance of connecting with individual collectors.  Let's delve into why this approach is essential and explore its advantages, drawing inspiration from successful artist-collector relationships.  Building personal connections with collectors is a powerful strategy, especially in terms of return on investment. When collectors feel a personal connection to an artist, they are not just buying art; they are investing in a creative journey. This emotional bond often leads to long-term support and a loyal collector base.  Successful artists like Gabe Weis, Klara, ThankyouX and Diana Sinclair have demonstrated how fostering relationships with collectors can sustain their careers. These artists have nurtured their communities, engaging with them regularly and creating a sense of belonging that extends beyond the mere exchange of art for money.  There are a few fundamental pillars that can lead to artistic success now and in the long term. Part of the process includes artists maintaining complete ownership of their brands. In the context of crypto this means having their own mint sites, smart contracts and collector experiences.  Brand dilution through hosting on marketplace aggregators both impersonalizes the experience of buying an artwork and forces the artist to be beholden to the whims of third parties.  Traditional NFT promotional and marketing techniques no longer work  The term ""community"" has become somewhat overused in the Web3 ecosystem, but for artists, it boils down to a group of people who actively support and engage with their work. These individuals are enthusiastic about the artist's creations and interact with them through various social mediums.  Artists should always think first about providing intrinsic value to their community before looking for extrinsic rewards. This means regularly checking in with collectors and hosting events so they know who is active, and possibly collaborating with other artists to build a bigger network of collectors.  Such communities are invaluable, providing artists with a stable foundation that shields them from the unpredictable fluctuations of any market. The reality of the current Web3 ecosystem is that traditional NFT promotional and marketing techniques no longer work in a bear market, and that means artists have to be more creative and innovative with how they promote their work and engage collectors. This could involve creating alternative and recurring revenue streams using a variety of tools including free claims, paid mints, memberships, incorporation of physical items and IRL experiences.  Each artist needs to make data-driven decisions on what techniques work best for their work and be constantly experimenting. For example, combining Google Analytics on a personally branded website with qualitative surveys on social media channels provides robust insights on collector demographics, onsite behavior and interests that will guide artists in making more informed decisions about strategic approaches to marketing activations, content creation and communication strategies.  At the same time artists should not overlook the enduring strength of traditional distribution methods. These methods, such as art galleries, exhibitions and physical art shows, have stood the test of time and continue to provide reliability in an ever-changing art landscape. Embracing traditional methods allows artists to adapt their work to fit formats beyond the digital, increasing the likelihood their art is accessible to a broader audience.  See also: The Many Layers of the SEC's First NFT Enforcement Action | Opinion  The method to secure these more traditional avenues often comes back to self-promotion from the artists themselves, to reach a point where a gallery or exhibit would want to partner with them.  Addressing the negative reputation associated with NFTs is also crucial. While some NFT investments have been speculative in nature, it's essential to recognize that art retains its intrinsic value beyond its digital form. Art's value lies in the belief in the creator and their unique vision.  Collectors are drawn to artists they believe in, artists who connect with them on a personal level. Artists should look to convey that unique vision by giving background on their work or the specific release they’re promoting, finding adjacent communities, organizing digital and in-real-life events and showing their face as much as possible to help create a real connection with people.

Uphold’s Largest Crypto Holding In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton quoted a report that stated that XRP made up Uphold’s largest crypto holding. The platform is said to hold $1.25 billion worth of the token in customer funds. This is more impressive as Uphold’s customers only hold $168 million worth of Bitcoin on the platform. Related Reading: Why This 70-Year-Old Billionaire Wants To Own Bitcoin Deaton could not hold back his surprise at these figures as it meant that there were almost 10 times more XRP on the platform in comparison to BTC. As to the reason why Uphold may have such a large XRP holding, YouTuber Matt stated that it could be from the platform getting all the businesses from their competitors when they delisted the token. Major crypto exchanges, including the second largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Coinbase, delisted the XRP token after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the company and its executives back in 2020. While agreeing with Matt’s comment, Deaton also mentioned how XRP contributed to Uphold’s growth, noting that the token represented “62%” of the company’s trading fees for over two years. He further mentioned how Uphold only had five million users when he signed up on the platform, but now, it boasts 30 million users. XRP On The Platform Set To Increase The XRP holdings on the platform are expected to increase with the newly forged partnership between Ripple and Uphold. As part of the partnership, Uphold will provide its infrastructure to be used in furtherance of the Ripple Payments service, which focuses on cross-border transactions. Related Reading: Time To Exit Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Predicts 75% Breakdown To $8,000 Uphold will further provide Ripple with the liquidity needed to process these transactions. To achieve this, Uphold has stated that it won’t use its existing customers’ XRP holdings but will instead use its “expertise” to source XRP on the open market. Uphold has, over time, shown to be a firm believer in Ripple’s vision, and many in the XRP community seem to be very supportive of the partnership, with some highlighting how Uphold stuck by the token through “thick and thin.” At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.57, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

19655309,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558404,1698768044,"Spot Bitcoin ETF: Here’s The Magic Number To Push BTC Past $40,000","David Lawant, the head of research for FalconX, an institutional crypto trading platform tailored for financial institutions, recently provided an insightful forecast regarding the future of Bitcoin (BTC) prices in light of the anticipated launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Sharing his predictions via X (previously known as Twitter), he articulated the financial variables that might play a decisive role. Lawant remarked, “The next significant variable to watch in the spot BTC ETF launch saga will be how much AUM these instruments will gather once they launch. I think the market is currently expecting this inflow to be between $500 million and $1.5 billion.” The Magic Number To Push Bitcoin Price Past $40,000 The crypto community is keenly anticipating a positive nod for a Spot Bitcoin ETF either at the end of 2023 or the beginning of 2024. A crucial date on the calendar is January 10, 2024, which is set as the final deadline for the ARK/21 Shares application, leading the current series of applications. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket Like In March If This Happens: Expert Undoubtedly, a green signal from regulatory authorities for the spot ETF will be a game-changer for the entire crypto asset class. Lawant highlighted the importance of this development, stating, “It will open room for large pockets of capital that today can’t properly access crypto, such as financial advisors, and bring a stamp of approval from the world’s most prominent capital markets regulator.” The pressing question, though, is the immediate impact on capital inflow. “The first couple of weeks after launch will be critical to test how much appetite there is for crypto at the moment in these still relatively untapped pools of capital,” Lawant emphasized. Relying on historical data, Lawant pointed out the stability of the ask side of BTC’s order book, especially for prices situated above the $30,000 mark. This data allows for an approximation of how the inflow of capital might influence the price trajectory of BTC. Through various inflow scenarios squared against a spectrum of the depth of market scenarios, Lawant deduces that the market is possibly forecasting net inflows ranging between $500 million and $1.5 billion within the initial weeks post-launch. Drawing conclusions from his analysis, Lawant surmised: For BTC to establish a new range between the current level and more than $40k, the total net inflows would need to amount to $1.5 billion+. On the other hand, if total net inflows come in below $500 million, we could move back to the $30k level or even below. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $3 Million Is “A 100X From Today”, And You Are Still Early: Crypto Advocate However, it’s paramount to note the inherent assumptions in Lawant’s analysis. He admits, “One is that the move from $28.5k to $34.0k was entirely attributed to the market anticipating price-insensitive net inflows from the ETF launch.” This means, among other things, that the current price increase was triggered neither by the correlation with gold nor by the global crises or turmoil in the bond market. Lawant also highlighted the potential variability in BTC price movement across the order book. Nonetheless, given the stature of issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and Ark Invest in the SEC queue, the current favorable macroeconomic climate for alternative monetary assets, and prospective improved liquidity conditions, Lawant remains bullish about the potential BTC price rally following the ETF debut. He concluded with, “ceteris paribus I’m still excited about how the BTC price could react to the ETF launch.” At press time, BTC traded at $34,542.

Trading giants Jane Street, Virtu Financial, Jump Trading and Hudson River Trading have held talks with BlackRock about a market-making role, according to a BlackRock slide deck reviewed by the person familiar with the matter.  BlackRock, Jane Street, Virtu and Jump declined to comment. Hudson River Trading, also known as HRT, didn't respond to a request for comment.  The U.S. regulatory crackdown on crypto this year – a seeming reaction to FTX's implosion and other 2022 scandals – has persuaded some U.S. firms to curtail their activity in the space. Bloomberg reported earlier in May that Jane Street and Jump had curtailed their crypto trading amid that crackdown.  Assuming the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves some or all of the dozen or so applications for bitcoin ETFs (including the one from BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager), that would open a new pathway for U.S.-based firms to get a piece of the action in crypto – in a way that plays to their conventional strengths. Being a market-maker for ETFs, which trade on exchanges just like stocks, requires a level of sophistication and automation that only a relatively few companies can achieve.  Market makers are vital to ETFs. They are responsible for creating and redeeming new shares of an ETF, a role designed to keep its price tethered to the price implied by the value of the ETF's holdings.  One of the best examples of why such a create-and-redeem structure is important actually comes from crypto. Grayscale Investments offers a product called the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) whose price has over the past few years wandered dramatically far away from the billions of dollars worth of bitcoin [BTC] that it owns. Unlike an ETF, shares of this trust cannot be redeemed for BTC. Grayscale (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group) has applied to convert GBTC into an ETF.  Grayscale's initial application for the conversion was rejected by the SEC, but a court in August excoriated the regulator's rationale. The SEC decided in October not to appeal that ruling, a move widely seen as boosting the odds bitcoin ETFs will become a reality in the U.S.  ""Several market makers were pulling back and being quite cautious because there was some heavy cracking down on exchanges,"" said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, a provider of crypto exchange-traded products. ""But since the Grayscale ruling, we've seen a very real change in stance from the SEC.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/31/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-might-have-trading-support-of-heavyweights-like-jane-street-jump-and-virtu-source,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5176c66a7ef9e2c380456681aaefb95cd9c7cabc-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what on-chain data says regarding whether this rise can continue. PEPE Has Seen Some On-Chain Metrics Light Up Recently In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed how PEPE is looking in terms of its on-chain indicators currently. The first metric of interest here is the profit/loss breakdown of the memecoin’s user base. The distribution of the PEPE holders based on whether they are in loss or profit | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As displayed above, about 35% of the holders/addresses of the cryptocurrency are carrying their coins with some net unrealized profit right now. On the other hand, the loss investors amount to 51% of the network’s user base, meaning that the majority of the holders are in the red currently. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Top Here? This Metric Would Say Otherwise The remaining 14% of the addresses are breaking even at the current price levels of the asset. Generally, the investors carrying profits are more likely to sell their coins to harvest their gains, which means that if there are many holders in profit, significant selling pressure could arise in the market. In the current scenario, however, more than 50% of the investors are still carrying their coins at a loss despite the recent 60% surge that PEPE has enjoyed. Thus, the potential selling pressure in the sector may not be too much yet. This could certainly be a positive sign for the rally’s sustainability. Next, IntoTheBlock has pointed out how the address activity related to PEPE has observed a significant boost recently. Looks like the metrics have registered high values in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X According to the analytics firm, the active addresses jumped 372% between October 19th and 25th, while the new addresses increased by 440% in the same period. The “active addresses” metric keeps track of the daily number of addresses participating in some transaction activity on the blockchain. In contrast, the new addresses indicator measures the daily number of wallets coming online on the network for the first time. The sharp growth in these indicators would imply that network activity has been high recently, both in terms of usage and adoption. Historically, rallies have thrived in such conditions, as a large number of active traders is what such moves require to be sustainable. Lastly, IntoTheBlock has pointed out that while the PEPE whales haven’t shown concrete signs of accumulation yet, they have been potentially becoming active recently. The metric has seen some uptick recently | Source: IntoTheBlock on X From the chart, it’s visible that the “large transactions volume” has observed some rise recently. The large transactions refer to transactions worth at least $100,000 in value, usually made by the whales and institutional entities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Solid Above $34,000 Despite High Short-Term Holder Profit-Taking While the uptick in the activity of these humongous investors hasn’t been that much, it’s still an optimistic sign that these investors have been showing at least some interest in PEPE during this rally. PEPE Price Since its sharp rise, PEPE has gone stale in the last few days as its price continues to trade around $0.0000011672.

42419285,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9eP,1698764400,"Coinbase-Backed Advocacy Group Enlists Crypto Masses, Raises $2M From 80,000","A Coinbase (COIN) effort to drum up a cross-country swell of amateur crypto advocates – the nonprofit Stand With Crypto – has paid off with a surge of more than 100,000 individuals getting involved in the opening weeks, organizers say.  At the group's website, people can easily reach out to policymakers and learn about politicians' crypto views. So far, 80,000 have given money to keep Stand With Crypto rolling, clearing the $2 million mark, said Nick Carr, the organization's chief strategist. Half of that funding is from single donor Brian Armstrong, Coinbase's CEO.  ""Our goal is to truly unite and coalesce the crypto grassroots community,"" Carr said in an interview. He said the group is trying to be a ""one-stop shop"" for crypto advocacy. He said it's so far been used for more than 16,000 calls and emails to members of Congress.  The donations are meant to help grow the policy-influencing functions of the group's site, including artificial-intelligence-aided outreach to lawmakers and information portals showing where elected officials stand on crypto. The group is also planning more in-person events, Carr said.  While it's billed as a grassroots affair, the group owes its origins to digital assets exchange Coinbase, which is still involved in the effort after the August launch.  ""Centralized lobbying is not going to get it done in Washington,"" said Kara Calvert, head of U.S. policy for Coinbase, in an interview.  The crypto message is more powerful coming from the people local to the districts and states directly to the lawmakers, she said.  ""They answer to their voters,"" she said, not companies like Coinbase.  This is a tumultuous time for crypto policy, because the House of Representatives has driven multiple crypto-oversight bills to the edge of passage, though the Senate is generally more reluctant to take action. Two narrow slivers of digital assets legislation – stablecoin regulation and money-laundering safeguards – have the highest potential to reach the finish line in the near term, according to professional lobbyists.  As in every congressional calendar, it pays to watch the budget bills that need to pass – most notably, the plan for defense spending – to see if crypto legislation gets attached at the 11th hour. At the moment, a House bill on stablecoin regulation has some bipartisan support, and in the aftermath of headlines linking Hamas to crypto donations, legislation stiffening industry money-laundering protections may also have momentum.  Though Stand With Crypto is meant to gather crypto enthusiasts at all levels, the biggest digital asset companies could benefit if the group starts making progress with lawmakers.  ""I think broadening that base is something that wasn't happening before and I think all of the crypto companies continue to have a vested interest in this,"" Calvert said.

42419295,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9nh,1698763405,"In Crypto's 'Autonomous Worlds,' Creators Are Architects and Users Are Stakeholders","“Web 3.0 is about creating a truly decentralized web, where individuals are in control of their own data and have true ownership and sovereignty over their online identities.” – Balaji Srinivasan  Web 2 deserves a lot of credit. It gave us interactive platforms where non-celebrities could build audiences of millions with almost no friction. It allowed us to circumvent the gatekeepers of culture: the networks that controlled information throughout the twentieth century. But the same centralization problems that plagued the pre-Facebook attention economy have re-emerged over the past decade as a few dominant platforms capture an even greater share of global attention than the mega-corps of the 20th century.  Felix Xu is the founder of ARPA and Bella Protocol.  In Andreessen Horowitz partner Chris Dixon’s blog “Why Decentralization Matters,” he shows how the S-curve modeling the extractive relationship between tech platforms and users was flattening, and how more and more was getting stripped from users over time. And it’s not just users; the same goes for all businesses, developers and creators that rely on these platforms.  Most of their efforts over the past five years have focused on extraction, running more ads to increase profit with only meager efforts to redistribute the nearly $400 billion in net income they earned since 2018 to creators.  Of course, Big Tech founders deserve a little credit. Alphabet’s YouTube and Web 2 newcomer TikTok have made being a “creator” or “influencer” a viable career path for tens of thousands of people. YouTube, which accounts for around 11% of Google’s total revenue, has a generous revenue share of up to 45% for large creators. TikTok’s revenue share is far lower, but many creators can earn a decent living selling ads on their pages that they negotiate on their own.  See also: Tech's Money Woes: Beginning of the End for Web2? | Opinion  The real problem with Web 2 is not their limited revenue-sharing, it's the fact that creators are subject to the whims of platforms whose interests are increasingly divergent from their own. The ever-present risk of deplatforming and obscure algorithms determines the fate of every creator. Of course, many other smaller creators have been quietly deplatformed without redress and entire sites, including OnlyFans and Patreon, have mass demonetized their creator-bases without warning.  Beyond boundaries, beyond centralization  While Web 2.0 introduced us to a new age of content consumption, it still binds creators to the mercy of centralized platforms. The desire for true ownership, not just of content but of entire digital realms, leads us to the next frontier: Autonomous Worlds (AWs). These aren't mere constructs in the vast expanse of crypto terminology but represent a profound evolution in our digital interactions and experiences.  Pioneered by Oxparc, these digital realms stand apart from typical Web 3.0 environments. Their distinction lies in their hard diegetic boundaries (within a world), meticulously formalized introduction rules, and the absence of any privileged gatekeepers.  In these worlds, creators are not just contributors; they are architects  In these decentralized landscapes, the relationship between creator and consumer transcends traditional boundaries. Instead of being limited by platforms, creators can craft entire universes and consumers can engage in ways previously unimagined. Imagine a virtual art gallery where artists not only showcase their creations but where the certain elements of the digital space itself are edited, changed and evolve based on collective decisions.  Or consider a massive online game where the rules aren't set by a single developer but are shaped and reshaped by its players. There are rules and spaces set up at its creation. Going forward edits are approved with consensus, new societies and interactions change, possibilities offered by AWs. (Disclaimer: ARPA builds Randcast, a random number generator that aims to ensure verifiable randomness in digital spaces and AWs).  If Web 2.0 was about giving voice to individual creators, Autonomous Worlds is about granting them the power to shape entire digital ecosystems. The transition from individual content pieces to expansive, interactive worlds marks a shift from mere creation to holistic world-building.  In these worlds, creators are not just contributors; they are architects, shaping the very fabric of digital reality. And consumers? They're not just passive viewers. They become active participants, stakeholders and even co-creators. The lines blur, forming a collaborative tapestry of interaction, engagement and shared ownership.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS,Felix Xu,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/31/in-cryptos-autonomous-worlds-creators-are-architects-and-users-are-stakeholders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/409437dae2710cc3aa82a3cdd84aee8978bc50a0-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Described as a ""modular data availability network that securely scales with the number of users,"" Celestia aims to solve scalability and stability issues that are common with monolithic blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.  ""It's the start of a new era,"" the Celestia Foundation, which supports development on the network, wrote in a blog post. ""The modular era.""  As of about 2:30 ET (6:40 UTC), the TIA tokens were changing hands around $2.29, according to CoinMarketCap.  ""Based on current market prices, the Celestia airdrop is estimated to distribute about $120 million in on-chain value, targeting users in the Cosmos [ATOM] and Ethereum [ETH] layer 2 ecosystems,"" Sean Farrell, an analyst at FundStrat, wrote in a note to subscribers on Tuesday. ""This could either stimulate on-chain activity or flow into related assets, benefitting asset prices.""  Modular blockchains are designed to solve scalability issues by using specific channels for speed and execution, unlike monolithic blockchains, which can scale only at the expense of decentralization or security. Celestia also uses data availability sampling (DAS), a way of verifying all data that is available on a blockchain. The combination helps increase the speed at which data is transferred.  ""Celestia’s mainnet beta launch marks the arrival of the first live modular data availability network with data availability sampling,"" said Ekram Ahmed, a spokesperson at the Celestia Foundation. ""Celestia mainnet is a giant leap in our mission to make deploying chains as easy as smart contracts.”  The beta enables rollups and other modular chains to use Celestia as a data availability and consensus layer.  The blockchain will initially have 2MB blocks with support for up to 8MB blocks, with upgrades due to be made after an on-chain governance process. The company hopes to support 1GB blocks to ""provide abundant data availability for the modular ecosystem"" in the future.

42419286,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9gT,1698762641,Sam Bankman-Fried Again Blames Underlings for Woes as FTX Founder Wraps Up Testimony,"NEW YORK — Facing pointed questions from prosecutors on Tuesday, Sam Bankman-Fried seemed to struggle to find the words he wanted to say, especially when questioned about his apparent nonchalance about an $8 billion hole in Alameda Research's balance sheet – money allegedly pilfered from customers of his FTX crypto exchange.  It was the defendant's fourth – and final – day testifying in his criminal fraud trial over the collapse of FTX, which was once valued at $32 billion.  Bankman-Fried was the last witness from either the defense or the prosecution. Just before Judge Lewis Kaplan released the jury for the day, Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's lawyer, mounted a brief rebuttal, giving time for the defendant to clarify certain answers he gave to the government's questions.  Whether those clarifications will be enough to sway the jury could be seen as soon as Friday. Closing arguments in Bankman-Fried's trial are set to begin on Wednesday and are expected to take around a day. Then, the jury will finally be ready to deliberate – something that could take several days given the complexity of this case, which has already stretched into its fifth week.  Grilling SBF again  Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon began her second day questioning the FTX founder on Tuesday by touching on his close relationship with the government of the Bahamas, where FTX was based, and its prime minister, Philip Davis. The prosecutor also zeroed in on FTX's use of Alameda subsidiaries like ""North Dimension"" to access banking services – a relationship that, in the view of prosecutors, gave Alameda improper access to FTX users' funds.  Sassoon took particular aim at what she characterized as Bankman-Fried's ""cozy relationship"" with Bahamian regulators, noting that Davis and his wife received tickets to a game at the FTX Arena in Miami (now known as the Kaseya Center). Bankman-Fried said he recalled the couple visiting a game, but not how they got the tickets or where they sat. Sassoon then pulled up a message from a chat in which Bankman-Fried said they used FTX's seats.  Sassoon appeared to insinuate that this relationship was improper: She pulled up Bankman-Fried's correspondence with a Bahamian regulator where Bankman-Fried offered to open up withdrawals to Bahamian customers. The offer, which he ultimately followed through on, took place while withdrawals were frozen for customers from other countries.  Getting pedantic about FTX customers' money  In a particularly testy exchange toward the close of her cross-examination, Sassoon asked Bankman-Fried if he ever informed FTX customers that their funds were going to Alameda, the hedge fund he founded before starting FTX, or that they were being spent.  ""I don't recall giving directions,"" he replied multiple times.  Later in the line of questioning regarding Alameda's alleged spending of FTX customer assets, Bankman-Fried said he wouldn't say the funds were spent, so much as they were used. Sassoon rejoined by asking if that meant they were being used to fund investments. He said that was correct.  Read all of CoinDesk's SBF trial coverage here.  Bankman-Fried also continued to claim a fuzzy memory about the details of the last few years. When asked what he said to FTX engineers (and key government witnesses) Gary Wang and Nishad Singh after he learned $8 billion had gone missing as the result of a computer bug, Bankman-Fried said they told him they were busy and that he should stop asking questions.  ""So, it's your testimony that your supervisees told you to stop asking questions?"" Sassoon shot back at him. Another time she asked, ""Did you call in your lieutenants and ask 'who spent $8 billion?'""  Sassoon eventually moved to FTX's November 2022 collapse, when the exchange and Alameda filed for bankruptcy because FTX didn't have enough money to satisfy customers' withdrawal requests.  Earlier in his testimony, Bankman-Fried defended a tweet thread from Nov. 7 – a few days before FTX filed for bankruptcy – in which he told users ""assets are fine."" This was technically accurate, he reasoned, because he believed Alameda still had enough money on hand to refund FTX customer deposits.  But Sassoon challenged a key piece of this claim. She asked about FTX's token, FTT, which formed a large portion of Alameda's balance sheet. Sassoon tried to force a confession from Sam: Didn't he know, by November 2022, that FTT was illiquid (meaning it wasn't worth nearly as much as Alameda accounted for)?  ""I don't think I would've said that,"" he responded.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Scoops Help CoinDesk Win a Loeb Award, a Top Journalism Prize  In response, Sassoon pulled up a text from a ""small group chat"" on the Signal messaging app in which he told colleagues, including former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and Singh, the former FTX engineering director, that if they sold their FTT, ""there wouldn't be a huge amount of liquidity.""  Bankman-Fried has so far tried to present an alternative explanation of how one of the world's better-known trading platforms collapsed, suggesting it grew too quickly and without sufficient oversight or risk planning. However, prosecutors – led by Sassoon – have sought to puncture that narrative, grilling Bankman-Fried about his involvement in FTX and its sibling (Alameda), his public statements and whether he was permitted to use FTX customer funds, a key issue at the heart of the criminal case.

One community member, who bought the meme coin over five years ago, has come forward to explain why they still hold the coin with expectations for where the DOGE price is headed. Dogecoin Price Rise To $26 The trader first posted a chart to TradingView in September outlining why they believe that the Dogecoin price would see such a meteoric rise. According to the trader who goes by John Burr, he had been holding the altcoin for a long time after initially getting into it in 2017. Related Reading: Solo Bitcoin Miner Snags $200,000 Block Reward, How Did They Do It? Going forward, the trader had seen the meteoric rise of Dogecoin through 2017 and 2018, and then again through 2021, sitting on a profitable bag since then. However, the trader is convinced that there is more to come as he says, “I am waiting the bullish wave again.” The chart shared by Burr starts out at the $0.0615 level and then shows a similar bounce to the 2020-2021 rally. This bounce in the chart puts the DOGE price at an initial price target of $0.7, effectively returning it back to its previous all-time high levels. However, it doesn’t end there because another bounce takes place to take DOGE all the way to the $27 mark. Source: Tradingview.com In total, the cumulation of the rally would see Dogecoin rally more than 37,500% to reach this level. This could easily rival the 2021 price jump and mark two mega pumps in the history of the coin. Explaining his reasoning, the trader said: When I have a conversation about securities with my buddies, the conversation typically involves action-forcing events that trigger pumps and dumps. All of this is noise because we are talking about what happens on a daily interval. When I zoom out, none of the bear arguments matter, valid or not. Explaining The Pattern Behind The Rally The trader points to an M pattern in the chart that backs up this forecast. This has appeared before when the price starts to rise before falling back down. But then as the trader points out, the altcoin goes on to form a W pattern which cements the bull rally. Related Reading: 19,197 BTC Makes Its Way Out Of Binance, Trigger For Bitcoin Recovery? One thing that was missing from this analysis, however, is what the trader referred to as “THE DIP”. Apparently, this is a dip in DOGE price that comes once the W pattern forms. At the time, Burr was unsure if this dip had happened, saying, “I can’t tell if we have experienced that Dip recently or if there is a big Dip coming soon. Whichever the case, I see the next bullish wave coming. And I am not going to get shaken out if the Dip does come.” However, on October 31, Burr updated his analysis to include a confirmation of the dip. “I am now comfortable to say that “THE DIP” has passed. I expect generally sideway action until December 2023,” the trader said. “Then I expect the bull run to last throughout the year until December of 2024.” DOGE price settles at $0.07 | Source: DOGEUSD On Tradingview.com Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-meteoric-37500-26/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42419287,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9hV,1698759319,Bitcoin 2008: Satoshi Nakamoto’s Busy Few Months Building the Revolutionary 'P2P Electronic Cash' Network,"From Aug. 18, 2008, to Oct. 31 of the same year, Satoshi Nakamoto must have had a hectic few months. That summer day, Nakamoto had registered the bitcoin.org domain name, indicating perhaps the first time the pseudonymous cryptography expert realized he may be onto something. By Halloween Day, the day the Bitcoin white paper was first sent out to a cryptography mailing list, announcing the project to the world, Nakamoto had hard-coded the entire project.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “I actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper,” Nakamoto wrote on Nov. 11, 2008. He was responding to cryptography mailing list subscriber Hal Finney, the receiver of the first bitcoin transaction, who in 2004 had built a reusable proof-of-work system that inspired Bitcoin.  Of course, there’s evidence suggesting that Nakamoto had had the idea far earlier than 2008. For instance, in an early 2010 email to Jon Matonis, a former VISA executive, congratulating him on a blog post Matonis wrote about the long development of electronic money, Nakamoto said he wished “there was something like that when I originally researched this three years ago.”  “Bitcoin would be right up your alley,” Nakamoto said. Matonis would go on to become a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation.  At the time, Nakamoto discussed Bitcoin in a few narrow ways. Although he often responded to interested potential users, or did outreach himself trying to bring the revolutionary technology in front of cryptography fans, hardcore coders and libertarians Nakamoto presented Bitcoin as a fairly utilitarian and spartan project. When someone created the first Wikipedia page for Bitcoin in July 2010, Nakamoto said it was too “promotional” for his taste.  “Just letting people know what it is, where it fits into the electronic money space, not trying to convince them that it's good,” Nakamoto added.  Bitcoin is, as Nakamoto described it, an electronic, peer-to-peer currency-like system. It could “become” a currency so long as people ascribe value to it, and that could happen for any number of reasons like wanting to collect interesting things or needing an alternative to using credit cards online, he had suggested. “Bitcoins have no dividend or potential future dividend, therefore not like a stock,” he wrote.” “More like a collectible or commodity.”  Read more: Nick Baker - On Bitcoin White Paper's 15th Anniversary, Wall Street Threatens to Swallow Its One-Time Challenger  But the chief innovation Nakamoto knew from the beginning was that Bitcoin has no central issuer, or “mint,” as he sometimes called it. “There isn’t a central mint or company running it. As long as there are users, it survives,” he wrote in that 2010 email to Matonis. Someone so deeply involved in the digital currency space of the ’90s knew that experiments like DigiCash and LibertyReserve failed because there was a person or company in the middle to become compromised.  This is a revolutionary idea, of course, and the first of many cryptocurrency experiments to follow that replaced “trust intermediaries” with certain cryptographic guarantees and the collective empowerment of users. Users gave bitcoin its value, and they are incentivized to see the network grow. At the time, Nakamoto thought Bitcoin might be useful for small transactions like micropayments, which “massive overhead costs” at banks make impossible, as well as international transfers or private payments.  Not all of Nakamoto’s early ideas panned out. Micropayments have failed to materialize, and today it’s painfully obvious how unfit a fully-public network like Bitcoin is for privacy. But he was right that Bitcoin would grow to become a real alternative to trust-based finance. Today, the total value of bitcoin in circulation is worth over $672 billion and financial institutions from BlackRock to VanEck want in.  See also: What Will Wall Street’s Bitcoin Narrative Be? | Opinion  Bitcoin abstracted away the trust that is inherent in the modern money system, where banks and other financial institutions keep track of all the transactions that flow through and ultimately decide which were valid and who could use the system. Bitcoin is as much a public broadcast system as it is a currency network, which allows anyone, anywhere to validate and verify the blockchain on their own.  Or, as Nakamoto told Wei Dei, the inventor of another Bitcoin progenitor, b-cash, it solves the “double-spend” problem and other issues of trust in money by using a “peer-to-peer network” that “timestamps transactions” and “hashes them into an ongoing” chain “that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.” Nakamoto had reached out on Friday, Aug. 22, 2008, to ask Dei how he should be cited in the Bitcoin white paper.

42419297,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9pl,1698759000,Sam Bankman-Fried Needs Better Answers on the Stand,"There was a moment on Monday where an assistant U.S. attorney needed to ask FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried if he was the chairman and sole board member of Alameda Research, while showing him a document that he signed, which literally identified him as the chairman and sole board member. And Sam's response was he did not intend to be, which curiously enough, was not the question actually asked.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  'I'm not sure how to interpret the metadata'  The narrative  Sam Bankman-Fried is still in court trying to defend himself against charges he defrauded and conspired to defraud a bunch of people by stealing FTX customer and investor funds and blowing it on frivolous things like private jet rides and luxury apartments. Monday's testimony was especially, I would argue, rough for the defendant. And since I'm still spending every day in court watching the greatest show in crypto, I'm going to ditch whatever I was originally planning to write about and instead invite you inside Monday's performance.  Why it matters  This case is just getting more intriguing, especially now that the defendant himself is testifying.  Breaking it down  You remember those DirecTV Rob Lowe ads? Rob Lowe with DirecTV is a suave dude. Rob Lowe with old-fashioned cable TV is a bit rough to look at. Bankman-Fried's testimony provides a very similar split-screen moment. He did well enough when responding to questions from Mark Cohen, his defense attorney. He provided a compelling explanation of how FTX collapsed – potentially compelling enough to convince a jury of his peers that he didn't defraud all the people he allegedly defrauded. He was the DirecTV version of himself.  And then it was Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon's turn to ask questions. That's when he, in a big way, became the rough, cable-TV version.  Am I insane? Or was the back-and-forth over whether Bankman-Fried was the sole board member of Alameda insane?  Reader, I invite you to judge for yourself:  Sassoon: ""Do you see at the top where it says 'Alameda Research, Unanimous Consent of Board of Directors, Stock Transfer'?""  Bankman-Fried: ""Yep."" [Editor's note: He kept saying ""yep"" instead of ""yes,"" which shouldn't be a big deal but kind of added to the tonal issues.]  Sassoon: ""This is transferring the Robinhood stock to yourself, right?""  Bankman-Fried: ""Transferring it from one company that I was a partial owner of to another company I was a partial owner of. Sorry. I'm not sure it says it's transferred to me.""  Sassoon: ""You owned the company it was transferred to, right?""  Bankman-Fried: ""I was one of the owners of both the companies.""  … and then later …  Sassoon: ""You were the only member of the board?""  Bankman-Fried: ""It looks like it.""  Sassoon: ""Were you in fact the only member of the board?""  Bankman-Fried: ""I'm not sure which board this refers to.""  Look, this exchange dragged on in this fashion for a while, to the point that Judge Lewis Kaplan stepped in: ""You owned 90% of the stock, right? Did you become a director by mistake or accident or something?""  The critical question has always been how the jury views the different witnesses and their testimony. Would the 18 (now 17) randomly selected New Yorkers find the prosecution's parade of people more compelling than Bankman-Fried and his tiny slate of defenders?  The defense walked Bankman-Fried through a series of questions where he subtly contradicted many of the major witnesses called by Department of Justice prosecutors, making this a real question. After Monday's performance, it seems a bit easier to answer.  Bankman-Fried's got two issues, as my colleague Danny Nelson wrote last week: One is that he doesn't have a lot of particularly satisfying responses to some of the DOJ's questions (from a substantive viewpoint). The other is that he doesn't have a lot of particularly satisfying responses to some of the DOJ's questions (from a ""words, what do they mean?"" viewpoint).  On the second issue first: He really is not coming off as a compelling or truthful witness. He's continuing to provide long-winded and overly hedged responses to some pretty basic responses. Judge Lewis Kaplan had to repeatedly tell him to answer the question that was actually asked, and to use words like ""yes"" or ""no.""  Sassoon is drawing out Bankman-Fried's less compelling side. At one point, she pulled up an FTX marketing deck, which included a slide on clawbacks, and asked him to read the first subheading. Bankman-Fried started reading a number of words, before Sassoon interrupted him and asked him to specifically read the subheading.  ""The first word is preventing, the second word is clawbacks,"" he said, sparking disbelieving laughs from the overflow room gallery.  Other notable moments include Sassoon suggesting Bankman-Fried lied under oath before the House Financial Services Committee, and pointing out that he told a lot of people about his efforts to shape his image – even as he claimed he did not remember telling any of the nearly dozen people she pointed to about those efforts.  At one point Sassoon asked how Bankman-Fried got to the Super Bowl, where he snapped a photo with Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Kate Hudson and other people. Bankman-Fried said he didn't remember.  ""You don't recall flying to the Super Bowl on a private plane?""  And after receiving a negative response: ""Is it because you flew on a private plane so frequently?""  On the actual substance, Bankman-Fried again struggled to provide coherent responses. Sassoon asked him repeatedly if he saw a spreadsheet laying out Alameda's balances. Though Bankman-Fried testified Friday that he saw one of the tabs (the one titled ""Alt 7""), he hedged – a lot – on Monday. Sassoon asked if he saw the spreadsheet. Bankman-Fried again hedged, leading to Sassoon pulling up the metadata provided by Google showing it had been looked at by Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research email account.  ""I'm not sure how to interpret the metadata,"" Bankman-Fried said, leading to another interjection from the judge:  ""You were not asked how to interpret the metadata.""

The firm is targeting Mexico as it is the second largest bond market in Latin America, after Brazil, according to the company's research. The market is also one of the most liquid in Latin America, with $623 billion in outstanding debt and an average daily trading volume of $200 million, the research added.  The majority of trading volume in Mexico comes from institutions, governments and foreign investors, according to a press release from Etherfuse, presenting a lack of retail investors or individuals investing in bonds.  With just 2% of bondholders being Mexican, Etherfuse is attempting to change this by offering up Stablebonds to retail investors.  Stablebonds are built on Solana and are backed by the Mexican Government, according to the press release.  This comes as tokenizing real-world assets becomes increasingly popular. According to real-world asset (RWA) monitoring platform RWA.xyz, the tokenized Treasury market has surged to $698 million as of Monday from around $100 million at the start of the year.  ""Stablebonds mark an evolution of investment solutions,"" said Dave Taylor, CEO and co-founder of Etherfuse, in the statement.

19650907,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558373,1698757200,XRP Price Confirms Breakout Above Multi-Month Resistance: Next Targets,"Renowned crypto analysts, Dark Defender, Jaydee, and Egrag have provided insights into the recent performance of XRP against the US dollar. All three analysts agree that XRP has confirmed a breakout from a multi-month resistance level yesterday and could be poised for another leg up. XRP Price Successfully Breaks Out In the 4-hour time frame, Dark Defender has highlighted the formation of a “bull flag” pattern. This is usually considered a bullish continuation signal. Prior to the formation of this pattern, XRP experienced a significant upside move and then entered a consolidation. By surging above $0.55 yesterday, XRP validated the bull flag pattern. Dark Defender posted, “confirmed”, alluding to a previous post where he stated the uptrend is reinforced by the Ichimoku cloud, which provided support below the price. “XRP formed a bull flag pattern, and this structure precisely touches our target at $0.66 in the 4H time frame,” the analyst remarked. Jaydee’s analysis, using a daily time frame, showcases the price breaking the multi-month trendline resistance. The analyst spotlighted the importance of the $0.54 price level, stating that the longer the asset holds above this level, the lesser the chances of a false breakout. He predicts that the XRP price could rise above $0.60 in the short term. Related Reading: XRP Price About To See “Face Ripping” Rally, Legendary Trader Weights In “GASP!* Are we confirming the multi-month trendline breakout today? Finally, people are paying more attention to the charts that have been calling the crashes (& ignoring hopium that keeps REKTin Dumb Money) SMH LOL! Let’s go! Jaydee stated. Egrag has shared a similar prediction as the other two analysts. In one of his latest analyses, Egrag refers to the $0.55 level as “the ultimate battleground” and emphasizes the tug-of-war between the bulls and bears at this critical juncture. Looking at the 4-hour time frame, Egrag notes the commendable efforts of the bulls to maintain candle closes above the $0.55 level. In contrast, the bears are persistently trying to push the price back below that threshold. The current challenge, according to the analyst, is that the XRP price needs to seal two consecutive full candles above the $0.55 level in the daily chart. Moreover, on the 3-day chart, the bulls must succeed in confirming a single candle close above this important price point. Egrag suggests that such a result would pave the way for the next significant challenge on the weekly chart. What’s Next? Based on the combined insights from the charts, the immediate target for XRP appears to be the $0.66 level, as indicated by the bull flag pattern on Dark Defender’s analysis. However, sustaining above the $0.54-$0.55 level will be crucial to affirm the bullish breakout and diminish the chances of a price pullback. Related Reading: XRP Price Breakout Soon? Analyst Points To Bullish Structural Signs The analysis using Fibonacci retracement levels further corroborates the analyst’s perspective. Upon examining the 1-day chart, it’s evident that the XRP price surpassed the 0.236 Fibonacci level at $0.554 yesterday after a multi-day struggle. This suggests a potential weakening of bearish momentum, hinting at a continued upward price trajectory. The subsequent targets to watch include the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $0.626 and the pivotal 0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.685. It’s worth noting that the 50% Fibonacci mark holds psychological significance, as reaching it would mean XRP has reclaimed half of its prior bearish slide after the summary judgment in the Ripple vs. SEC case.

42419296,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9oj,1698757004,Drawbacks of Stablecoin Cross-Border Use Outweigh Benefits: Global Payments Watchdog,"Even fully regulated stablecoins may not have a positive impact on cross-border payments, according to a report by standard setter CPMI.  Challenges including coordination, competition, network scale and inadequate regulation, could outstrip any benefits, the report said.  No existing stablecoin is fully compliant with relevant regulatory requirements, and even if one were to exist, it might not prove a great help for cross-border payments, global standard setters said in a Tuesday report.  The Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), which sets norms for the sector for the Bank for International Settlements, said stablecoins could ""open up opportunities"" for cross-border transfers by speeding up transactions and lowering costs, as proponents claim, but potential drawbacks would probably outweigh the benefits.  ""The challenges could include coordination, competition, network scale and market structure, and the lack of internationally consistent and effective regulation, supervision and oversight,"" the report said.  Standard-setters are rushing to introduce norms for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to that of other assets such as fiat currencies, particularly after Facebook (now Meta) proposed such a currency and terraUSD (UST), a multibillion-dollar stablecoin, de-pegged from the U.S. dollar in May 2022 with catastrophic consequences for the crypto world. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which is set to publish global standards for stablecoins, warned in February that existing stablecoins will fall short of the guidelines.  The CPMI report follows an effort announced last October to probe if stablecoins could help improve cross-border payments. The findings aren't flattering.  ""The report acknowledges that no stablecoin arrangements yet exist that are deemed to be properly designed and regulated and fully compliant with all relevant regulatory requirements. Further, even if such stablecoin arrangements did exist and could help to address specific cross-border payment frictions, they might not necessarily positively impact cross-border payments as the drawbacks could outweigh any potential benefits,"" a separate statement on the report said.  The incoming head of CPMI, the former European Central Bank board member Fabio Panetta, said in a Tuesday Financial Times op-ed that the world needs a better cross-border payments network, but that unbacked crypto and even stablecoins ""cannot guarantee convertibility at par at all times, making them prone to runs.""",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/31/drawbacks-of-stablecoin-cross-border-use-outweigh-benefits-global-payments-watchdog,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/655f6b5aa1b4a0767b302ed975cbb82fd0f79370-5760x3240.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Solana’s SOL outperformed other top crypto assets in October with a 50% gain. SOL is also up over 250% year-to-date. The surge comes after last year’s downturn when investors speculated the future of Solana after the collapse of the ecosystem’s top backer, FTX, threw the blockchain’s future in disarray. The Solana community is currently hosting its annual conference Breakpoint in Amsterdam. According to a growth report on Solana by Messari, “if Solana’s growth story is to continue, a constant stream of new experiments will have to flood in, with a few grand slams finding product market fit.” Bitcoin witnessed a 23% gain in October after hitting a 16-month high of $35,000 on Oct. 23. Ether had a less impressive month, gaining just 3%. Chainlink’s LINK followed behind Solana with a 42% uptick over the same period.  Sam Bankman-Fried’s attorneys are trying again to have the jury overseeing his trial consider the role of English law in governing FTX’s terms of service, hoping it may lead to a “not guilty” verdict on some of the fraud charges the exchange founder faces. “For misappropriation to have occurred, under the Government’s theory, there must have existed a trust, fiduciary relationship, or a similar relationship between FTX and its customers,” a filing including a proposed jury instruction said. The proposed jury instruction would tell the 12 individuals deciding Bankman-Fried’s fate that “FTX’s relationship with its customers was governed by the Terms of Service,” which are ""governed by ... English law.” An additional set of filings provides example cases from the U.K.  Bitcoin [BTC] miners are evolving into industrial-scale enterprises, with North America gaining market share over China, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday as it initiated coverage of the sector in the U.S. Bernstein says it prefers Riot Platforms [RIOT], giving it an outperform rating and a $15.60 price target, and also rated CleanSpark [CLSK] outperform with a $5.30 price target. These miners are “market share consolidators with strong operational edge (self-mining model), low cost of production (low power cost), high liquidity and unlevered balance sheets,” wrote analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra.

19649544,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558376,1698753651,"Solana (SOL) Leads Gains Among Top Coins, Can Bulls Send The Price To $40?","SOL ranks among the bullish cryptocurrencies today, benefitting from the ongoing rally in the crypto market. $40 looks more realistic since SOL overcame the psychological resistance level of $20. Based on its present trajectory and exciting events in the Solana community, investors wonder if it will attain $40 in the coming days. The technical indicators in the chart below will uncover SOL’s price trajectory in the coming days. SOL Testing $36.69 Resistance, Will The Bulls Rally To $40? SOL is in an uptrend on the daily chart, forming a third consecutive green candle as the buyers continue accumulating. Remarkably, SOL flipped the $33.05 resistance level to support on October 30 and is testing the $36.69 support today, October 31. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket Like In March If This Happens: Expert The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator displays a value of 77.78, already in the overbought region above 70. The RSI shows no signs of a decline, implying that more buyers are opening long positions for SOL. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator is above its signal line, displaying a strong buy signal. This signal is confirmed by the green Histogram bars formed on October 30 and today. Therefore, SOL will likely rally to the $40 resistance level in the coming days if the buyers push it above the $36.69 resistance level. However, if rejection occurs at $36.69 and the RSI retraces from the overbought level, buyers must apply a trailing stop loss to curtail massive losses. Nevertheless, SOL looks well positioned to return to $40 based on its strong support level at $33.05. Also, some exciting developments in the Solana community are driving more investors to the ecosystem and boosting SOL’s price. Solana’s Launch Of Block Explorer Amidst Other Developments Solana Developers, on October 30, announced that Cymbal’s Human Readable Block Explorer now supports Solana. It’s worth mentioning that Solana has organized over 466,000 NFT projects, has over 10 million active wallets, and tracked over 36 million tokens in real time. The Cymbal AI helps Solana users keep track of their activities with ease and is a welcome development in the ecosystem. Also, there is much excitement in the crypto community for the ongoing Solana Breakpoint 2023 annual conference that began on October 30. This event is in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with notable speakers taking vital topics surrounding blockchain technology. The first day of the event featured an address from JavaScript co-founder and Brave CEO Brendan Eich. According to Eich, there are massive integrations with Solana support coming to the Brave browser in 2024. This announcement by the CEO is likely driving the adoption of SOL tokens ahead of a potential price surge above $40. Related Reading: Ethereum DeFi Activities On A Roll: Will It Drive A Bullish Price Surge? Additionally, Phantom Mobile announced the creation of an NFT feature not available on their mobile devices but supported by Solana. According to the developers with Camera Mint on Phantom Mobile, users can instantly convert photos and videos into Solana NFTs using the app. The diversity of the Solana ecosystem makes it ideal for most investors since its tokens are still quite affordable. Therefore, SOL could rally in the coming days if the buyers continue the ongoing accumulation phase.

42419293,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9ld,1698750356,Bitcoin's 'Triangular Consolidation' Is Bullish: Technical Analysis,"Bitcoin [BTC] appears to be consolidating into a triangular pattern, offering a positive outlook for the weeks ahead.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has carved out higher lows and lower highs between $33,000 and $35,0000 in the past seven days, forming a triangle on the bitcoin price chart.  Analysts and traders study price patterns to gauge momentum strength and forecast changes in market trends. Triangles tend to be continuation patterns, representing a pause that refreshes the preceding trend, which is bullish in BTC's case. The leading cryptocurrency rallied from $26,500 to $35,000 before starting its triangular behavior.  ""Bitcoin is forming a triangle on the daily chart. It is generally believed that such consolidation formations end with an upward breakout,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.  According to Kuptsikevich, a move above $35,000 would confirm a bullish triangle breakout, signaling a continuation of the rally from $26,500.  Note that while triangles usually resolve in the direction of the preceding trend, they can sometimes end with a downside breakout, indicating a bearish trend reversal.

While the gains have been minimal, a prominent analyst, Ali Martinez, suggests that there might be room for further development. Martinez’s analysis reveals that Dogecoin, as seen on the weekly chart, is breaking free from a multiyear descending triangle pattern. This pattern is a technical analysis pattern used in financial markets to predict potential price movements. In this pattern, a horizontal line represents a level of support, while a descending trendline signifies a level of resistance. #Dogecoin shows promising signs, breaking out from a multi-year descending triangle on the $DOGE weekly chart! The confirmation of a buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator within this timeframe reinforces #DOGE bullish outlook. pic.twitter.com/ao7VXyxaEa — Ali (@ali_charts) October 29, 2023 DOGE: Resilience Amid Market Volatility The price typically bounces between these two lines, creating a triangle shape. Breakouts from this pattern often indicate a significant price movement. In the case of Dogecoin, breaking out from this pattern suggests a potential upward price movement. Current data from CoinGecko places Dogecoin’s price at $0.069051, reflecting a 1.0% increase in the past 24 hours and a 2.0% rise over the previous seven days. Martinez has specifically noted that the meme coin is displaying a confirmation of a buy signal generated by the TD Sequential indicator within this timeframe. DOGE seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Artificial Intelligence Crypto Boom: What’s Behind The Double-Digit Surge? Bullish Dogecoin Indicators The TD Sequential indicator is a technical analysis tool that helps traders identify potential points of trend exhaustion or trend continuation. A buy signal in this context indicates that the current price movement is expected to continue upward, which aligns with Martinez’s optimism regarding Dogecoin’s future prospects. In a surprising turn of events, a Dogecoin wallet that had remained dormant for nearly a decade came back to life recently. This wallet was involved in a series of significant transactions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. The blockchain tracking platform Blockchair first detected this sudden activity. Blockchair’s data showed that the inactive wallet executed three separate transfers on October 28 and October 29. These transactions involved the movement of DOGE tokens amounting to $372,461 to a different wallet. The sheer scale of this movement has raised eyebrows within the cryptocurrency community. The reactivation of a long-dormant wallet and the substantial transfers it conducted have stirred speculation within the Dogecoin community. Such significant transactions have the potential to influence market sentiment and, subsequently, price movements. Traders and enthusiasts will be closely monitoring the market to assess the impact of this whale move on Dogecoin’s price.

Shin was indicted in April by South Korean authorities for his affiliation with the multibillion-dollar crypto enterprise and charged him with violating capital-markets law.

His lawyers reiterated the departure during the trial in South Korea, saying he ""parted ways"" with co-founder Kwon in 2020, according to the report.  ""The cause of the coin plunge was the unreasonable operation of the Anchor Protocol conducted by CEO Kwon and external attacks. It has nothing to do with [Shin],” a lawyer reportedly said.  Anchor protocol was a lending platform built on Terra that allowed investors to earn high yields on their deposits and borrow against their crypto holdings. After the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its peg to the U.S. dollar ahead of the collapse, deposits on Anchor took a plunge, contributing further to the crisis.

42419289,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE9iX,1698746425,Spain Brings Forward MiCA Crypto Rules by Six Months After EU Pressure,"Spain has brought forward transitional provisions under the EU crypto law, MiCA, by six months.  Crypto firms already registered in the country will have to apply the rules by December 2025.  Spain said it will bring forward implementation of the European Union's crypto law, MiCA, by six months in a move likely to affect crypto firms already registered in the country, including Binance, Kraken and Coinbase (COIN).  The rules introduce tough consumer-protection measures for crypto firms, and in principle kick in at the end of next year for companies seeking a new license. Companies already operating under national law, however, can carry on for a further 18 months, and regulators are anxious that an overlong implementation period would place customers of the bloc's roughly 2,000 registered crypto companies at a disadvantage.  The Spanish government now wants implementation by December 2025, half a year shorter than MiCA requires.  ""The government will shorten the transitional period of application ... with the aim of creating a predictable and stable regulatory and supervisory framework,"" the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Digital Transformation said in an Oct. 26 press release in Spanish.  In an Oct. 17 letter, the European Securities and Markets Authority, an EU watchdog partly responsible for policing the law, encouraged countries to shorten the transition period, which it fears offers a consumer-protection loophole for a potentially large number of providers.

42419309,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBa9,1698746400,Bankman-Fried Had a Hairy Day in Court,"An observation from sleep-deprived day 15 of Sam Bankman-Fried's criminal trial: prosecutors embrace the inevitable outcome of male pattern baldness; defense lawyers don't.  This newsletter offers exhibit D: U.S. Attorney Damian Willams. The ""Sovereign District's"" top cop strode into Manhattan's highest courtroom around 11:30 a.m. Monday, his freshly shaved head glinting beneath its 10 chandeliers. The forty-something came to watch the final twists of a ""big, big case"" (as one U.S. Marshal called it) against a defendant represented by two balding lawyers older than he: Mark Cohen (big bald spot) and Chris Everdell (small bald spot).  I might have some insight into why prosecutors – but not defense lawyers – rock shiny crowns if I hadn't gotten to court nearly 11 hours earlier. Probably it would be something witty about the government's confidence in a case that the U.S. Marshal called a ""big W"" for Damian.  Yes … let's run with that.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Williams' deputy, Danielle Sassoon is definitely not bald. She arrived donning a hairstyle my female colleagues in the press corp identified as a ""blow out.""  Sassoon's cross-examination evisceration of the alleged crypto fraudster was hard to watch.  Determined to highlight inconsistencies in the former crypto chief's alternate history, the assistant U.S. attorney leveraged his prolific history of tweeting, interviewing and testifying before Congress about FTX's purported greatness and safeness.  She wanted to catch Bankman-Fried in a lie. After four hours she'd at least gotten the next-best thing: evidence he's is a VERY unreliable narrator.  ""Would you agree that you know how to tell a good story?"" Sassoon asked Bankman-Fried early on, prompting someone in the gallery to guffaw.  Bankman-Fried audibly bristled at Sassoon's tactics. He taunted her in a sing-songy cadence when told to read FTX materials that contradicted him. His unyielding ""yeps"" started low on the y and finished high on the p. He spent most of cross-examination repeating variations of ""I don't know"" (16 times) like ""sounds plausible"" (twice) ""I may have"" (17 times), ""I don't recall"" (27 times) and ""I'm not confident"" (three times), when asked about his own words.  ""I can explain it, if you want,"" Bankman-Fried offered on a handful of occasions where Sassoon forced him to accede into damning characterizations. She never took him up on it.  His responses weren't always responses. Judge Lewis Kaplan reprimanded Bankman-Fried for avoiding prosecutor questions and interjecting his own. His gaze stayed mostly on Sassoon, but sometimes he darted to the jury box.  There, 17 pairs of eyes may have shot back a mix of skepticism and, by the end of the day, boredom and perhaps a bit of despair. Some jurors were growing visibly tired of Bankman-Fried's waffling ""I don't remember"" defense after four weeks of trial. A few new sleepyheads drifted off.  Their ""get on with it"" mentality was shared by: Judge Lewis Kaplan, the press corps, and even Williams. He and his red folder marked ""confidential"" walked out of the courtroom early.  Sassoon, however, shows no signs of letting up. She hasn't yet gotten a smoking gun out of Bankman-Fried (despite his waffling), but that's only because he spent so much of their standoff acting like the guy who already shot it… and forgot.  She'll go for another two hours of cross-examination Tuesday.  — Danny Nelson  Courtroom scenes  The overflow room was collectively losing its mind at Bankman-Fried's testimony. It's not just what he said, but how he said things. He repeatedly said he didn't remember telling reporters key details about Alameda or creating documents acknowledging FTX and Alameda's financial ties. And every time he did, AUSA Sassoon would follow up with ""let's bring up government exhibit"" something or other, in which Bankman-Fried said exactly the thing she was asking about. He gave the impression he was being shifty, despite the fact that government witnesses Gary Wang and Nishad Singh had similar responses to topics they said they did not recall.  It's possible this is due to the rain (it was absolutely miserable yesterday), but far fewer people showed up at 9:00 a.m. on Monday than had on Friday. There were maybe just north of 50 reporters and members of the general public by the time the courtroom and overflow room opened, though a second overflow room was still needed by lunchtime.  Sassoon tried to pin Bankman-Fried on marketing FTX International as a safe exchange (as opposed to FTX US), including by showing the end title card from an ad – no one picked up on this in court besides Danny but the end title's fine print makes it clear the ad is for FTX US.  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  AUSA Danielle Sassoon anticipates spending another two hours or so cross-examining Bankman-Fried on Tuesday. Once she's done, defense attorney Mark Cohen expects to spend maybe one or two more hours conducting a redirect examination. Assuming this gets us to maybe just past lunch, the Department of Justice does plan to present a rebuttal case.  Prosecutors plan to call two witnesses – an FBI agent and an employee of Apollo Global Capital, a firm that was involved in talks to potentially rescue FTX last year. Former general counsel Can Sun and Bankman-Fried have both provided competing versions of what exactly those talks looked like.  Judge Lewis Kaplan remains noncommittal with regard to the jury charge conference, saying he'll have more ""when the fat lady sings"" (an opera reference). Given that both the DOJ and defense previously estimated needing two to three hours each for closing arguments, and the judge expects a long conference, we can safely assume this will take us well into Thursday.  — Nikhilesh De",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE,"Danny Nelson, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/31/bankman-fried-had-a-hairy-day-in-court,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While speaking at an interview with billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, Druckenmiller compared Bitcoin to gold, noting its evolution into a recognizable brand and investment vehicle. Druckenmiller admits he doesn’t actually own any BTC as of the moment, but he’s been closely following it and thinks it could be an attractive investment. Druckenmiller Sees Bitcoin And Gold As Stores of Value Bitcoin has long been hailed by financial analysts as the ideal asset for hedging against inflation and storing value. Some have dubbed the cryptocurrency as the 21st century’s digital gold because of its low correlation with stocks, and Druckenmiller doesn’t disagree. Related Reading: Time To Exit Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Predicts 75% Breakdown To $8,000 Stanley Druckenmiller is the founder and former chairman of Duquesne Capital, and as a 70-year-old billionaire investor, he has seen a lot of financial trends come and go over the decades. But recently, he’s become fascinated with BTC. In the interview with Paul Tudor Jones, Druckenmiller stated that BTC has been particularly popular as a reputable brand because of its appeal to younger investors. The billionaire made this note while comparing Bitcoin to gold, the age-long store of value. “I’m 70 years old, I own gold. I was surprised that Bitcoin got going, but it’s clear that the young people look at it as a store of value because it’s a lot easier to do stuff with. And 17 years, to me, it’s a brand.” Druckenmiller said. Stanley Druckenmiller is one of the most successful hedge fund managers on Wall Street and is worth $6,200,000,000. He says, “Young people look at #bitcoin as a store of value. It’s a brand. I like it. I dont own any, but I should”pic.twitter.com/DXjrnvE1Qc — Documenting ₿itcoin 📄 (@DocumentingBTC) October 30, 2023 It would seem the billionaire hasn’t invested in Bitcoin yet mainly because of the lack of clear regulation in the crypto industry. Druckenmiller said that he had previously held BTC. However, he sold them in 2022 because of restrictive policies imposed by central banks. “I like gold because it’s a 5,000-year-old brand, but the young people have all the money,” Druckenmiller said. “So, I like them both. I don’t own any Bitcoin to be frank, but I should.” Druckenmiller’s History With BTC This isn’t the first time Druckenmiller has made positive comments about the crypto industry. Back in an interview in 2021, he likened Bitcoin to gold. He also predicted then that Ethereum could flip Bitcoin as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain spiked in popularity. In 2022, he said people could turn to crypto as more people lose faith in central banks. Related Reading: Solo Bitcoin Miner Snags $200,000 Block Reward, How Did They Do It? Investors like Druckenmiller and Jones have always praised Bitcoin, but others like Warren Buffet have been pessimistic. Buffet slammed BTC in a CNBC interview in April this year, calling it a “gambling token.” On the other hand, Bitcoin has been named as the best-performing asset class this year, outperforming stocks, bonds, commodities, and REITs.

A swath of alternative cryptocurrencies is following BTC’s lead, according to data provider ByteTree’s market breadth indicator, which measures the number of digital assets advancing relative to the number of coins declining.  The indicator powered by CryptoCompare tracks real-time data of more than 5,300 digital currencies and categorizes tokens by their trends on a scale of 1 to 5. A score of 5 means the coin is in a strong uptrend, while zero represents a strong downtrend.  At press time, just 4.7% of tokens are in a strong downtrend, the lowest since January. It shows market breadth is expanding, with more coins participating in the bitcoin rally.  Expanding market depth reflects increased investor risk appetite and suggests the bullish momentum is healthier and more sustainable.  “Crypto breadth is improving, so much so that there are few downtrends left.

42419312,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBdF,1698742318,Bitcoin's Heading to $150K and Quality Mining Stocks Offer a Good Way to Gain Exposure: Bernstein,"Bitcoin [BTC] is en route to hit $150 and crypto miners are evolving into industrial-scale enterprises, with North America gaining market share over China, broker Bernstein said in a research report Monday as it initiated coverage of the sector in the U.S.  Bernstein says it prefers Riot Platforms (RIOT), outperform rated with a $15.60 price target, and CleanSpark (CLSK), also outperform rated with a $5.30 price target.  These miners are “market share consolidators with strong operational edge (self-mining model), low cost of production (low power cost), high liquidity and unlevered balance sheets,” wrote analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra.  The broker has a market-perform rating on Marathon Digital (MARA) with an $8.30 price target. It notes that the company is the largest miner but with “sub-par costs (middle of cost curve) and debt, no operational edge (dependent on hosting partners).”  Riot and CleanSpark are “counter-cyclically investing in bitcoin self-mining capacity, unlike some miners who pivoted capacity to AI/high performance computing,” the report said, adding that it expects this “counter-cyclical BTC capacity to pay off” as the cycle turns.  “Bitcoin price cycles have followed 4 year patterns in sync with bitcoin halving,” and for the 2024-27 cycle the world's largest cryptocurrency is expected to “rise to a cycle high of $150,000 by mid 2025,” Bernstein said.  The next bitcoin halving is expected in April 2024 and a “winning bitcoin miner is a high-beta way to gain exposure,” the report added.

19643721,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558348,1698741004,Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket Like In March If This Happens: Expert,"In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Ram Ahluwalia, the CEO of Lumida Wealth, weighed in on the potential market impacts on Bitcoin, particularly highlighting the significance of a failed Treasury auction. Lumida Wealth, recognized as an SEC registered investment advisor, is known for its specialization in alternative investments and digital assets. Ahluwalia’s tweet emphasized the need to monitor Bitcoin’s response to specific macroeconomic events. He stated, “The test for Bitcoin as a macro asset will be ‘What happens if there is a failed Treasury auction?’ This year, Bitcoin rallied during (1) the March bank failures and (2) as Treasury rates have rattled markets. Here is the third test …” Will Bitcoin See Another 50%+ Rally? To recall, Bitcoin’s price shot up by over 55% in the aftermath of the US banking crisis earlier this year. On March 10, 2023, the Silicon Valley Bank’s unprecedented collapse, attributed to a bank run coupled with a capital crisis, became a focal point of the broader 2023 United States banking crisis. This saw a domino effect with multiple small to mid-sized US banks falling within a span of five days. While the global banking sector stocks plummeted, Bitcoin experienced a substantial surge in its value. Related Reading: This Chart Makes It Clear: Bitcoin Is Bullish More recently, Bitcoin is rallying even as treasury rates continue to unsettle global markets. With the 10-year US Treasury yield crossing the 5% mark for the first time in 16 years, there are indications of rising interest rates on government bonds. Typically, such yield increments may push investors to reconfigure their portfolios away from risk assets, adding to market volatility. However, akin to gold, Bitcoin has recently been acting as a safe-haven asset in turbulent times. Diving deeper into the topic, Ahluwalia elucidated, “The Bitcoin rally, in part, is due to concerns that the Federal Reserve may need to intervene with Yield Curve Control or QE. Fidelity makes the case that the Fed may need to engage in Japanese style Yield Curve Control. If so, that would be strongly bullish for real estate, stocks, Bitcoin, bonds, REITs, TIPS and real assets more generally. It would also be bearish for the USD. The US has hard choices ahead.” He further emphasized the importance of structuring portfolios to withstand potential economic shocks and underscored the importance of commodities in weathering inflationary pressures. Ahluwalia shared his perspective on the current state of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury markets, pointing to recent Treasury auctions that displayed softer bid-to-cover ratios. “There is a legitimate argument that the Fed may need to intervene in Treasury markets. The recent Treasury auctions have weaker bid-to-cover ratios. Japan and American households are the marginal buyer…and they’ve been rewarded with losses,” Ahluwalia remarked. Three Peat For BTC As Safe-Haven He added that the Fed’s balance sheet “is already upside down […] it has the equivalent of negative equity (called a Deferred Asset) – an accounting treatment that is not permitted for private companies… The Federal Reserve…has $1.5 trillion mark-to-market losses because it bought Treasuries & MBS. For the first time in 107 years, this bank has negative net interest margin. Its losses are poised to exceed its capital base.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Poised For Another Surge Like Last Week: Here’s Why Ahluwalia explained that a treasury auction is deemed unsuccessful when the US Department of the Treasury initiates its regular auctioning of government securities, such as Treasury bills, notes, or bonds, but fails to attract adequate bids to cover the entirety of the securities on offer. Essentially, this signals a lack of investor interest in acquiring the government’s debt tools at the predetermined interest rates or yields. On Bitcoin’s intrinsic value, Ahluwalia noted, “My view on Bitcoin is that it is a ‘hedge against negative real rates’. That’s CFA talk for what Bitcoiners refer to colloquially as ‘money printer go brrr’.” He also stressed the potential repercussions on risk assets if long-end rates were to see a significant spike. “If long-end rates do blow out, that would hurt risk assets like long-duration Treasuries. The higher discount rate would cause a re-rating in stocks – much like we saw in 2022 and the last two months. However, If Bitcoin can rally during a ‘yield curve dislocation scenario that would give Bitcoin a ‘three peat’. Bitcoin would then find a welcome home on a greater number of institutional balance sheets,” Ahluwalia concluded his bullish thesis for Bitcoin. At press time, BTC traded at $34,145.

Recent data reveals that Ethereum was the primary catalyst behind the surge in crypto Total Value Locked (TVL), amassing an impressive 75% of all deposited funds during the past week. Ethereum’s journey began with the groundbreaking innovation of smart contracts. It was the first protocol to introduce this game-changing technology, enabling the creation of self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. This innovation laid the foundation for the entire DeFi ecosystem, as it provided the framework for decentralized applications and automated transactions. One of the most compelling indicators of Ethereum’s continued dominance is the recent surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes. In the past week, Ethereum recorded a historic milestone, with over $9 billion in transactions settled on its network. This marks the highest weekly volume since mid-June and underscores the platform’s pivotal role in facilitating peer-to-peer trading and liquidity provision. .@ethereum dominated this week’s TVL growth rankings, accounting for $6.68B of the total $8.76B TVL growth across crypto last week. pic.twitter.com/45rqb3Seml — 0xScope (🪬 . 🪬) (@ScopeProtocol) October 30, 2023 Related Reading: Artificial Intelligence Crypto Boom: What’s Behind The Double-Digit Surge? ETH Price Dynamics And The BlackRock Factor As Ethereum continues to take center stage in the crypto landscape, the question on many investors’ minds is how this data will impact the price of ETH. Currently, according to CoinGecko, Ethereum is trading at $1,798, showing a modest 0.6% increase in the last 24 hours, with a minor 0.9% decrease over the past seven days. Venture capitalist Arthur Cheong has provided intriguing insights into the potential price trajectory of Ethereum. Cheong, the founder of DeFiance Capital, suggests that ETH could experience a significant rally if a specific scenario unfolds. He points to BlackRock, a financial giant, and its application for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). If BlackRock’s BTC ETF application is successful, it could pave the way for a similar Ethereum ETF application in the future. “ETH is probably the best six to 12 month long among large-cap assets now when BlackRock applies for a spot ETH ETF six to 12 months down the road,” Cheong wrote on the social media platform X. ETH is probably the best 6 to 12m long among large cap assets now when BlackRock applies for spot ETH ETF 6 to 12m down the road. Ethereum’s ESG friendliness and native staking yield will be appealing to institutional investors should BTC spot ETF turn out to be a success. — Arthur (@Arthur_0x) October 24, 2023 Related Reading: Ethereum Resilient Above $1,800 Pre-FOMC Meeting – Details ETHUSD currently trading at $1798.3 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Implications And Future Prospects The significance of Ethereum’s role in DeFi and blockchain technology cannot be overstated. Its smart contract functionality revolutionized the crypto space and enabled the birth of countless decentralized applications and platforms. The recent surge in DEX volumes underscores its pivotal role in facilitating crypto trading. As the crypto world closely watches developments surrounding BlackRock’s potential ETFs, Ethereum’s future appears promising. Should a BTC spot ETF materialize and pave the way for an Ethereum ETF, institutional investors may flock to Ethereum for its ESG attributes and staking yield opportunities.

42419303,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBUz,1698731743,Bitcoin Holds Steady Above $34K After Hawkish Bank of Japan Decision,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade above $34,000 after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) softened its grip on the “yield curve control” (YCC) program, counteracting the Federal Reserve’s liquidity tightening.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value changed hands at $34,300, representing a 0.18% drop on a 24-hour basis, CoinDesk data show.  On Tuesday, the central bank kept the short-term policy rate steady at -0.1%, continuing its negative interest rate policy. However, the BOJ said it would consider the 1% upper bound for the 10-year government bond yield as a “reference” rather than a hard cap. This tweak will allow for more yield fluctuations and relieve the pressure on the BOJ to step in with liquidity-boosting bond purchases every time the 10-year yield tests the erstwhile 1% hard cap.  Bitcoin is known to track changes in global fiat liquidity, and the Japanese central bank’s YCC has been a significant source of liquidity since 2016.  The BOJ’s move is consistent with Monday’s Nikkei report, which said the bank will take a more flexible stance, allowing the benchmark yield to rise above 1%. The U.S. dollar-Japanese yen (USD/JPY) pair has bounced back to 150 from 149.20, a sign the overnight Nikkei report had traders expecting the BOJ to move the hard cap to 1.25% or 1.5%.  Per some observers, BOJ’s latest tweak represents a stealth move away from the dovish YCC program, which calls for caution on the part of traders of liquidity-sensitive risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  “Key paragraph from the BOJ - 1% is now the “soft” upper limit (reference) and won’t be enforced as strictly. That, and the upward revision to inflation forecasts, means this is THE most hawkish BOJ has been in a while...just not as hawkish as the Nikkei leaks suggested,” rates strategist Rishi Mishra said on X.

42419304,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBW1,1698728856,Sam Bankman-Fried's Defense Team Makes Last-Ditch Bid to Get 'English Law' Detail in Jury Instructions,"Sam Bankman-Fried’s attorneys are trying again to have the jury overseeing his trial consider the role of English law in governing FTX’s terms of service, hoping it may lead to a “not guilty” verdict on some of the fraud charges the exchange founder faces.  “For misappropriation to have occurred, under the Government’s theory, there must have existed a trust, fiduciary relationship, or a similar relationship between FTX and its customers,” a filing including a proposed jury instruction said.  The proposed jury instruction would tell the 12 individuals deciding Bankman-Fried’s fate that ""FTX’s relationship with its customers was governed by the Terms of Service,"" which in turn are ""governed by ... English law.” An additional set of filings provides example cases from the U.K.  ""Under English law, the Terms of Service do not create a trust relationship or similar fiduciary relationship between FTX and its customers. Nor, under English law, do any representations made after a customer agreed to the Terms of Service create a trust relationship or similar fiduciary relationship,"" the filing suggested Judge Lewis Kaplan said. ""The mere fact that a person subjectively expected, understood or believed that a trust, fiduciary relationship, or similar relationship existed does not create such a relationship.""  Defense attorney Mark Cohen had former FTX General Counsel read a part of the terms of service in court earlier this month, which said, ""The terms and any dispute shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, English law.""  Read more: SBF Trial: What Did FTX’s Terms of Service Say About Customer Funds?  The Department of Justice hadn’t responded to the newest filing as of 10:30 p.m. EDT. Still, a previous filing opposing one of Bankman-Fried’s proposed expert witnesses made it clear that prosecutors believe focusing strictly on the wording of the Terms of Service and their application under English law misconstrues their charge.  “It is legally incorrect to imply to the jury that its focus should be solely on the terms of service ... rather than on the full range of the defendant’s misrepresentations and misleading conduct,” the DOJ’s Aug. 28 filing said.  Bankman-Fried’s past statements and ""the common understanding of cryptocurrency customers” are relevant in addition to the terms, that filing said. During the FTX founder’s trial, prosecutors have asked FTX customers and Bankman-Fried to discuss the exchange’s marketing and what that may have meant for customers more broadly.  Judge Kaplan has told the parties that he intends to hold a jury charge conference – which will let the parties argue over their various competing jury instruction proposals – after they both rest, which may occur as soon as Wednesday. Bankman-Fried took the stand last week, and is currently going through a cross-examination, which the DOJ expects to wrap up Tuesday morning.

19634508,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558321,1698724848,Cardano Climbs TVL Ranks: 198% Yearly Surge Puts Network Among Top 15,"Cardano (ADA), a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Layer-1 (L1) smart contract network launched in 2017, experienced a largely quiet Q3 2023 in the overall crypto market. However, the network faced challenges with a decline in ADA’s price and revenue. Despite these setbacks, Cardano showcased growth in its treasury balance, stablecoin market cap, and Total Value Locked (TVL) ranking. Furthermore, the network’s infrastructure and connections to other ecosystems have paved the way for future decentralized finance (DeFi) sector developments. Cardano Sees Decrease In Daily Active Addresses And Transactions According to a recent report by Messari, ADA’s price declined for the second consecutive quarter, down 9.5% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to $0.25, in line with the overall crypto market’s 9.2% QoQ fall. The revenue generated from transaction fees also decreased by 29.9% QoQ, reflecting a decline in user urgency to transact during this period. Related Reading: XRP Price About To See “Face Ripping” Rally, Legendary Trader Weights In Cardano’s Treasury balance grew by 7.2% QoQ to 1.39 billion ADA. Although the treasury’s value in USD terms decreased by 3.0% QoQ due to ADA price depreciation, it demonstrated steady growth in ADA holdings. Currently, 20% of transaction fees contribute to the treasury, providing a potential funding source for future projects. Moreover, Cardano experienced a decline in daily active addresses for the third consecutive quarter, down 28.9% QoQ to 41,100. Average daily transactions also decreased by 12.2% QoQ. However, the ratio of transactions to active addresses indicated that while the number of active users decreased, those present were power users, suggesting high engagement within the network. Average daily dapp transactions decreased by 14.7% QoQ, but overall, they increased by 40.0% YTD. Non-fungible token (NFT) transaction activity declined for the third consecutive quarter, while NFT trading volume increased, highlighting the growing value of Cardano NFTs. Cardano’s TVL Demonstrates Stability Despite Market Challenges Cardano’s TVL remained steady, declining only 0.1% QoQ. However, its TVL ranking among all networks improved from 21st to 15th during Q3, indicating relative growth compared to other ecosystems. The launch of two new stablecoins, iUSD and DJED, significantly contributed to the overall TVL growth, as the stablecoin market cap increased by 16.3% QoQ. Per the report, Cardano also made progress in interoperability and core infrastructure during Q3. Partnerships with networks like Wanchain and developments in state channels, on-chain governance, and sidechains demonstrate the network’s commitment to expanding its capabilities. Related Reading: Solo Bitcoin Miner Snags $200,000 Block Reward, How Did They Do It? Overall, Cardano’s Q3 2023 reflects a period of challenges and growth for the network. Despite declining ADA’s price and revenue, the treasury balance, stablecoin market cap, and TVL ranking showcased positive trends. The network’s infrastructure developments and connections to other ecosystems position it favorably for future advancements in the DeFi sector. As Cardano continues to address challenges and foster innovation, it remains a key player in the blockchain landscape. ADA Price Soars By 17% In 30 Days Despite the sideways movement and declines in various indicators of Cardano’s overall ecosystem, ADA has experienced a significant surge of 17% in the past 30 days. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.2983, continuing its upward trend recovery over the past weeks following a sharp decline since July 13 and a subsequent consolidation phase. This consolidation phase led to a breakout of the previous four-month trend, which halted on October 19, triggering the recent surge in the token’s price.

At spot rates, Bitcoin is stable but trending around 2023 highs, with buyers expecting more gains as market sentiment improves. Though most users are looking at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) as a trigger for the next leg up, Thorn is closely tracking events in the Bitcoin trading scene, specifically, the derivatives market. In the analyst’s assessment, options traders will be the primary drivers of the next bull run. Related Reading: Artificial Intelligence Crypto Boom: What’s Behind The Double-Digit Surge? Why $36,000 Is A Key Price Level To Watch Based on the analyst’s assessment, once Bitcoin breaks the $35,750 to $36,000 zone, “options dealers will need to buy $20m in spot BTC for every 1% upside move,” driving prices higher. The reason dealers have to buy or sell Bitcoin at the spot market depends on whether they are “short or long gamma.” The objective, when this happens, is to stay “delta neutral.” The decision to buy at the spot market comes after a “gamma squeeze,” which, as Thorn notes, lifted prices last week. Technically, a gamma squeeze arises when there is a spike in call (or buy) options being purchased, forcing options dealers, most of whom are market makers, to buy the underlying asset, in this case, Bitcoin, to hedge their positions and stay “delta neutral.” Going by trends and the current setup, especially in the daily chart, this could happen.

Looking at other metrics, Thorn noticed a divergence in supply held by speculators and long-term holders, opining that on-chain liquidity could be dwindling. However, on the bright side, the Z-Score ratio of market price to realized price shows that Bitcoin is in a “healthy” position. As of October 30, Bitcoin is within a bullish breakout formation, with traders bullish. Whether the uptrend remains depends on whether buyers follow through, pushing the coin above recent highs, away from the breakout level at around $32,000.

Rug pulls, a form of cryptocurrency scam, involve sudden and deliberate value drops in specific tokens, accompanied by the perpetrators swapping the native tokens for Ethereum (ETH). The meme coins affected by the rug pulls were identified as MEME, MEMEPAD, and TITANX. Multiple Rug Pulls Shake Crypto Market On Halloween According to PeckShield’s X (formerly Twitter) post, the MEME token on the Ethereum blockchain experienced a jaw-dropping 100% drop in value. The address 0xBd72…5871 was responsible for swapping a staggering 4,854,740,126,240,000 MEME tokens for approximately 43.68 ETH. It is important to note that the rug pull token shared the same name as the legitimate MEME token, adding to the confusion. Related Reading: This Chart Makes It Clear: Bitcoin Is Bullish Similarly, the MEMEPAD token on Ethereum suffered an identical 100% value drop. The address 0xBd72…5871 conducted a swap of 4,854,740,126,240,000 MEMEPAD tokens for around 44.84 ETH. Once again, the fraudulent crypto rug pull shared the same name as the genuine MEMEPAD token, compounding the deceitful nature of the scam. Additionally, the TITANX token launched two days ago, October 28, on Ethereum experienced a staggering 100% value decline. The address 0xBd72…5871 executed a swap of 4,854,740,126,240,000 TITANX tokens for approximately 46 ETH. Mirroring the previous instances, the rug pull token masqueraded under the same name as the legitimate TITANX crypto token. Fantom Foundation Funds Vanish In alarming events, the Fantom (FTM) Foundation finds itself entangled in a harrowing tale of fund drains and swift token swaps. PeckShield has reported two significant incidents involving the Fantom Foundation’s finances, leaving the organization with substantial losses. The first incident occurred on October 17, 2023, when wallets associated with the Fantom Foundation were drained of approximately $7 million worth of cryptocurrencies, equivalent to around 4,500 ETH. Related Reading: RSI Records Major Golden Cross: XRP Predicted To Cross The $1 Mark In 16 Days Additionally, on October 26, the Fantom Foundation faced another devastating event. An unidentified entity, the “Fantom Foundation Drainer,” executed a bold move by swapping a staggering 8,087,377.97 DAI for 4,560.52 ETH. The gravity of the situation intensified when the Fantom Foundation Drainer swiftly executed another swap on October 30, converting the 4,560.52 ETH back into approximately 8.3 million DAI within a mere 30 minutes. The Fantom Foundation is now faced with the daunting task of investigating the breaches, identifying the culprits, and fortifying its security infrastructure to prevent future incidents. Despite recent developments, the native token of the Fantom protocol, FTM, is trading at $0.2388, reflecting a 1% increase in the past 24 hours. Notably, the token has experienced a substantial surge across various time frames. Presently, it has maintained an upward trend, with gains of over 6% and 30% in the seven-day and fourteen-day periods, respectively. Over the year-to-date period, the token has recorded a 5% increase. These figures indicate the token’s positive performance and growth trajectory.

On October 30, Bryoles said the coin could rally to $3 million, and all it needs is to be “100X from today.” For this reason, the crypto supporter thinks users engaging with the coin are “still early.” Is This The BTC Road To $3 Million? The Bitcoin defender said the coin has “indescribable future value,” especially compared to other centralized finance (CeFi) market metrics like market capitalization. Bitcoin is changing hands at around 2023 highs, trading above the $34,500 level, with traders and coin holders expecting more gains. The expansion of last week saw the coin extend gains, lifting higher above the $32,000 level recorded in July. Considering the associated trading volume and resulting activity following the BTC jump, more supporters expect another rally in the next few sessions. Related Reading: RSI Records Major Golden Cross: XRP Predicted To Cross The $1 Mark In 16 Days Bitcoin is down 50% from the November 2021 peak, when prices surged to approximately $70,000. However, the coin has more than doubled after dropping to as low as $16,000 in November 2022. At spot rates, BTC has more than 100% from 2022 lows, emerging as “one of the top-performing assets.” This stellar performance, Bryoles adds, is despite Bitcoin maintaining a market cap of around $500 billion in 2023 while remaining “TINY in comparison to the world’s largest asset classes,” most of which include debt, equities, and gold. To support the hyperbolic prediction, the supporter pointed to the low Bitcoin adoption level of “0.05% and 0.5%.” An eventual increase to 10% means there will be 100X users, easily driving the coin to $3 million, though even this remains a “misleadingly pessimistic prediction,” according to Bryoles. At this valuation, the analyst added that the coin’s market cap will be “unfathomable.” Even so, all that is required is “4% of the global adult population to demand 1 million sats to exhaust exchanges.” Bitcoin Finds Support And Opposition: Will Bulls Win? Bitcoin remains the world’s most valuable crypto asset. At the same time, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might authorize the first spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).

Even now, Bitcoin continues to show strength but not everyone is convinced that this winning streak will continue. One of these is a crypto analyst who has maintained that the price of Bitcoin will be headed back downward with an immense drop in price to crown the rally. Seeing Bitcoin At $8,000 The crypto analyst who goes by holeyprofit first posted their analysis of Bitcoin on TradingView on October 22, right at the start of the uptrend. At this point, the Bitcoin price was still hovering just around $30,000, and the analyst posited that the price of asset would not be able to climb above $31,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Uniswap’s UNI As The Next Coin Primed For Breakout According to the analyst, the recovery would make investors want to get in the market because they believe the price of BTC would continue to go up. However, this would be a bull trap and a consistent downward trend would follow quickly. Following the Bitcoin breakout just a few days later, the analyst updated the forecast but maintained that the price would return back downward. An October 25 update from the analyst read: “If this indeed going to be a reversal, the recent action would imply a very strong one.” Source: Tradingview.com This sustained bearish expectation from the analyst prompted short positions which seemed to raised from $34,000 to $35,000. “Moved off the high a bit and so far we have early structural failure of the uptrend,” the post read. “Very possible we drop here and it’s just a pullback (Highly likely even in a bull move this would retrace, which is why the 34/35K short seems a no brainer to try again.” Doubling Down On Bearish BTC Stance The analysis from the crypto analyst had received a lot of backlash from Bitcoin bulls but holeyprofit remains unmoved in their resolution. Even after the BTC price continued to rise, the analyst maintains that the crypto is headed for the $8,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Crypto Spot Trading Volumes Climb To 8-Month Highs The most recent iteration of the post points out that the crypto is actually at the point where they expect it to start the downtrend.

42419318,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEBiP,1698710400,"On Bitcoin White Paper's 15th Anniversary, Wall Street Threatens to Swallow Its One-Time Challenger","If you were paying attention back then, you don't need to be told this, but for those who were not: Late October 2008 was an incredibly ugly time in money, markets and finance.  Major firms, most famously Lehman Brothers, had just collapsed or required bailouts. Many others were teetering, and the stock market was tanking. Governments and central banks were trying to contain the catastrophe. And I wasn't sleeping well, tangled up in covering the carnage at Bloomberg News.  Oct. 31, 2008, is also when the Bitcoin white paper came out – now 15 years ago to the day. Ensconced in traditional finance, I didn't notice the cryptocurrency revolution had begun, nor had the rest of what we now call TradFi; the financial system appeared to be burning down, after all – we were busy.  Satoshi Nakamoto's paper didn't explicitly say: The world needs a peer-to-peer system to move money around to replace Wall Street giants because they can't be trusted, they're falling apart, etc. But that was the vibe as folks picked up on the idea and made the Bitcoin blockchain and bitcoin [BTC] the cryptocurrency real.  Bitcoin got switched on, BTC started getting mined and stuff started happening – small stuff at first. Pizzas were purchased. A website morphed from a place to swap Magic: The Gathering cards to a giant crypto exchange – and then got massively hacked. Other cryptocurrencies debuted, expanding what blockchains could do. Crypto prices soared – like, really soared – as idealists who embraced the idea of decentralization and cutting out middlemen in finance harnessed Satoshi's ideas, made them real and extended them. (More than a few charlatans got involved as well.)  Wall Street and the rest of TradFi started paying attention – trying to move conventional financial operations onto blockchains and trading ""digital assets,"" their genteel term for cryptocurrencies.  Read more: What Will Wall Street's Bitcoin Narrative Be?  Today, we find ourselves at an ironic moment. These titans of finance are increasingly driving a space that, to many, was designed to put them out of business.  Take, for instance, the story of the moment (excluding Sam Bankman-Fried's ongoing criminal fraud trial). Giddiness over BlackRock (the biggest asset manager in the world) and some of its peers trying to list bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. pushed up bitcoin's price last week, a bet that these easy-to-trade products will bring a flood of investment into BTC. BlackRock and other ETF providers look poised to be – assuming regulators permit these products, and there are reasons to think they'll have to – the new bitcoin whales.  Read more: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Seeing Client Demand for Crypto 'Around The World'  Also, CME Group, owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, is close to overtaking Binance as the largest crypto derivatives exchange in the world. (CME's product is a cash-settled futures contract, essentially a side bet on bitcoin's price; no BTC changes hands). In other words, a business with roots in the 19th century and agricultural commodities like corn and pork bellies, and one of the key spots in all of traditional finance, is a major player in crypto trading.  That said, this is less about how much of the total BTC stash that Wall Street holds. Finance people are increasingly taking over the story – at least to the mainstream – around bitcoin, to an extent that is noteworthy.  What does TradFi muscling its way to the front of the pack mean for crypto?  First, an asterisk: Bitcoin ETFs and crypto derivatives trading (much of it involving BTC) don't mean finance bros are swallowing all of crypto. Bitcoin is not all of crypto – though its market capitalization as a percentage of the whole crypto market is at an unusually high level above 50%.  There are the myriad blockchains like Ethereum and its associated layer-2 networks such as Polygon that run smart contracts – software designed to power various financial and other applications – and that have their own tradable tokens.  That's a whole largely decentralized realm (in aspiration, if not always in practice) that, even to some in TradFi, represents a way to replace conventional ways of doing finance with blockchain-powered versions. That fits broadly with Satoshi's peer-to-peer vision, even if some of the folks that have adopted this mindset collect Wall Street-sized paychecks.  Which brings us back to the irony. Whether bitcoin and crypto folks like it or not, TradFi is coming/is already here – though the degree of their involvement will hinge on regulators' desires, and they're clearly not psyched, judging, for instance, from the actions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and banking agencies.  Crypto will still have its crypto-y moments, like last week when the price of a totally normal token called HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu zoomed higher.  ""We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust,"" Satoshi wrote 15 years ago.  After Sam Bankman-Fried, Do Kwon and Alex Mashinsky showed what can happen when you trust crypto natives, are users prepared to trust different crypto shepherds? Or will they finally ditch the shepherds, as Satoshi might have hoped?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nick Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/31/on-bitcoin-white-papers-15th-anniversary-wall-street-threatens-to-swallow-its-one-time-challenger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6b309002bc1072e621e9e3590109400af0a1b8b-1516x852.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
