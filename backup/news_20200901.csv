42422126,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKnyW,1599001920,Total Value on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Sets Another Record High Amid Market Rally,"Bitcoin’s Lightning Network set a record high Monday as total capacity held in the protocol’s payment channels – sometimes referred to as “total value locked” (TVL) – reached $12.4 million.    Two weeks ago, Lightning set the prior high of $12.37 million, surpassing the long-standing previous mark of $12.3 million that was reached in early July 2019 and lasted for 405 days.  Bitcoin’s price appreciation has certainly helped boost Lightning’s TVL as the bellwether cryptocurrency has gained more than 30% since July.  The total number of bitcoins held on Lightning sits at 1,060, up 24% so far this year, but still remains below the record high of 1,105 BTC set in early May 2019.  Compared with the tens of millions of dollars pouring into Ethereum and related protocols because of the decentralized finance craze, Lightning’s growth may seem slow, but a variety of data underscores the network’s steady increase in activity.  The number of publicly broadcasting nodes, for example, has steadily increased throughout the entire lifetime of the protocol. Currently more than 7,600 nodes are connected to payment channels, up 55% from January.  In August, Lightning’s node count grew 26%, adding 1,581 nodes, representing the largest monthly percentage growth since April 2018 and the largest real monthly growth ever.  Lightning Labs, the company building the most popular implementation of Lightning, LND, further quantified the network’s growth in a tweet shared earlier in August. Over 70 companies are currently building on LND, the company said.

It will be wholly separate from Dusk Network itself, a spokesperson told CoinDesk.  The exchange will adhere to the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) – a European Union regulatory framework for transparency and investor protection – and will, therefore, be able to operate across most of Europe.

42422119,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKnLl,1598998996,Uniswap Rises to Top of DeFi Charts Thanks to Rival Looking to Unseat It,"A vampire protocol has driven Uniswap to the top of the decentralized finance (DeFi) charts.      As of roughly 21:00 UTC, the automated market maker (AMM) has $1.65 billion in total value locked, according to DeFi Pulse, unseating lending platform Aave.      Sources with knowledge of the situation tell CoinDesk this is driven largely by a new Uniswap competitor, SushiSwap. One of the newer members of the Weird DeFi cohort is predicated on giving rewards in perpetuity to holders of its sushi (SUSHI) token.      Read more: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto’s ‘Weird DeFi’ Moment      According to an announcement on Medium, for roughly two weeks (100,000 blocks) ahead of launch, Ethereum users who stake liquidity provider (LP) tokens from Uniswap to SushiSwap will get 10X the liquidity mining rewards in the early going (1,000 SUSHI per block now versus 100 sushi after launch).      Right now SushiSwap is distributing rewards for LP tokens on ETH pools matched with USDT, USDC, AMPL, DAI, LINK, YFI and others. SUSHI holders will be able to vote-in more pools later.      Liquidity mining is when users get a new token for depositing their assets somewhere. What SushiSwap is doing is new. So, by dumping assets into Uniswap now, DeFi degens can amass LP tokens, which they can dump immediately into SUSHI and take advantage of this brief period of extremely generous SUSHI distribution.      Read more: How DeFi ‘Degens’ Are Gaming Ethereum’s Money Legos      Once the bonus period ends, SushiSwap will redeem all the Uniswap LP tokens and move its rival's assets over to SushiSwap's own pools, which is why some in the community are calling it ""vampire mining.""      Whereas Uniswap keeps 0.3% of every trade and distributes it to liquidity providers, Sushi will distribute 0.25% to liquidity providers and the rest to SUSHI holders.      DeFi Pulse always notes the ""dominance"" of the leading project. Uniswap dominance currently sits at 17.5%.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SUSHI,ETH | MINING | SUSHI | UNI | ZRX,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/01/uniswap-rises-to-top-of-defi-charts-thanks-to-rival-looking-to-unseat-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0fdd38add95e689dbe3e0e8af0739ed5f4cf1a4-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422123,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKnlb,1598998326,"Yearn.Finance's New Vault Leverages DeFi 'Triforce': ETH, MakerDAO and Curve","Decentralized finance (DeFi) looks set to gobble Ethereum.      On the Bankless YouTube channel Tuesday, the recently departed chief of oracles at MakerDAO, Mariano Conti, spoke about how excited he is to see Yearn.Finance create a vault for yield farming with ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain.      ""[Yearn.Finance] is probably the most interesting thing that has happened to DeFi since DeFi started. It revitalized my love for the space,"" Conti said during the interview. Conti is one of nine people voted in to serve as members of the multisig securing funds in Yearn.Finance.      There's a lot to unpack in the latest development from the $776 million project, but before we do let's say it the simple way: Yearn.Finance will make it easy for anyone who holds ETH to get involved with yield farming with just one cryptocurrency, ETH. Because Yearn.Finance leans on Curve, previous yield farming endeavors required deposits of various stablecoins.      ""It is live today. It is live right now. There is no UI,"" Conti said, though he expects the user interface to come this week, maybe within the next 24 hours. A big theme of the Bankless episode is the pace at which code is getting shipped in the Yearn community, as more and more people get involved with writing it and approving it using the governance token.      This could potentially be very big for Ethereum, and ETH is up over 10% since this time yesterday.      Yearn.Finance is sometimes referred to as yEarn, iEarn or just by the name of its governance token, YFI. Only recently released, the token's market cap has already flirted with $1 billion and YFI improbably traded as high as $38,369 per token on Aug. 31.      Read more: First Mover: Rookie YFI Token Jumped 8-Fold in August as DeFi Dominated      In truth, Yearn.Finance is a suite of products that a community of coders is building together. It enables users to deposit assets and let the software find the best yield. (It should be noted a strong community has galvanized behind this project; CoinDesk apologizes for worrying in July that its token name stood for ""You F**king Idiot"" but DeFi moves fast.)      One of the big advantages to this method at the present moment is gas savings: by running yield farming operations at scale, Yearn spreads gas costs for multiple operations across lots of users.    DeFi mythology    ""This new vault, the yETH vault, I call it the triforce of DeFi,"" Conti said.      The triforce is key to the mythology of video game franchise The Legend of Zelda, one that is beloved as a metaphor in geek culture. In this case, Conti is illustrating how yETH brings ETH, MakerDAO and Curve together.      Users will deposit ETH on Yearn, which will in turn deposit it in MakerDAO in order to borrow dai (DAI). The DAI will then be deposited in CRV in order to withdraw its liquidity provider (LP) tokens and earn CRV tokens, both of which can then be plugged into whatever the optimal place to farm them might be.      ""You are earning a lot of money on your ETH without losing exposure to your ETH,"" Conti said.      It's the smart contract equivalent of ""set it and forget it.""      Read more: COMP’s Sudden Growth Has Swamped a DEX Dealing Only in Stablecoins      As the Bankless crew discussed on the show, this raises one of those interesting questions for the website DeFi Pulse: will it count yETH as a deposit on MakerDAO or on Yearn? (DeFi Pulse was not immediately ready to make a ruling when contacted by CoinDesk.)      David Hoffman, a frequent crypto Twitter commentator, used a real-estate metaphor to describe the yETH flow. ""This is like getting a mortgage to purchase a house and putting a renter into a house in order to pay off that house,"" he said.      The real estate metaphor was natural for Hoffman, who was part of the early team on RealT, which is tokenizing real estate. Hoffman announced on this episode that he's joined the Bankless team full time. Ryan Sean Adams is the founder of Mythos Capital and his Bankless brand incorporates a newsletter, podcast and YouTube show.    Aligning incentives    Notably, the writer of the yETH smart contract will earn a small portion of all profits on it. The idea here is that it gives developers an incentive to write strategies for the project, though it also sounds similar to the early days of mutual funds where a large portion of investors' gains were wiped away by fees, until Vanguard came along and created indices.      ""The genius of YFI is they seem to incent everybody to do things,"" Adams said.      Read more: Why DeFi Pulse’s Key Metric Is So Simple It’s Confusing      Regardless, the Bankless hosts and Conti agreed Yearn reflects the intentions of the original decentralized autonomous organization, The DAO, without the disaster (so far).      ""It is the version of The DAO that we thought of when we thought of The DAO in [2016]. Except there's just more of everything,"" Hoffman said.      While warning users that this is all risky, the Bankless hosts emphasized this has been quite exciting for Ethereum denizens with the right risk profile.      As Hoffman put it:    ""You can just go on Twitter: Every time there's a new yield farm somebody quits their job.""",POSITIVE,CRV | ETH | YFI | DAI,CRV | ETH | MKR | YFI | DAI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/01/yearnfinances-new-vault-leverages-defi-triforce-eth-makerdao-and-curve,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f75f3bf1fab0e15590feb242b166d639a73b6303-1500x1055.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Secret contracts are a type of smart contract that allows private data to be used in decentralized applications without revealing the raw data. A formal proposal to introduce the contracts will be made on Sept. 8.    The inputs, outputs, and network state are encrypted in a secret contract, which means the data is hidden even on a public blockchain. It is also invisible to the nodes executing the contract.  The upgrade would be significant as it would make Secret Network the first main blockchain architecture that enables users to do general purpose privacy computation across nodes equipped with secure enclaves.  Secure enclaves are isolated areas within a hardware device where sensitive data is encrypted and inaccessible to other parts of the CPU.  The network is building connections to Ethereum, Cosmos Hub and other blockchain networks, with the aim of bringing “programmable privacy” to a wider array of protocols, according to Bair's blog post Friday.  The Secret Network made this announcement in advance of the mainnet launch so validators can coordinate due to the size of the upgrade, according to Bair.  “We believe that programmable privacy is the critical missing piece to global adoption of public blockchains and open financial systems,"" said Bair.

However, these platforms have another thing in common: outages in the midst of high volume.      On Monday, login issues were reported from customers on Robinhood, along with a few other similar trading platforms including giants TD Ameritrade and Schwab. The outage was allegedly caused by the stock splits of Apple and Tesla. Silicon Valley-based Robinhood was the subject of more than 400 complaints reported to U.S. regulators during the first half of 2020.      A spokesperson from TD Ameritrade acknowledged ""high levels of slowness"" some users experienced on its web and mobile platforms but did not offer an explanation of the cause. As of press time, Robinhood and Schwab did not respond to inquiries from CoinDesk.

The need for redundancy    After suffering a severe service outage in late August, Deribit, the most popular cryptocurrency options exchange, told CoinDesk it is working to enhance its platform to avoid this happening again.      “Our platform uses redundant load balancers to connect to multiple nodes, gateways to the platform, connecting to a single master node,” Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, told CoinDesk via Telegram on Aug. 27. “Today we experienced a hardware failure in this master node.”      Read more: Deribit Suffers Outage Over ‘Hardware Issues,’ May Miss Thursday’s Options Expiry      The problem was resolved when engineers successfully activated one of the regular nodes as the exchange’s new master node. The company will work on speeding up this procedure, Strijers said.      Strijers added that Deribit is in the process of setting up a disaster recovery facility in Zurich to act as immediate failover if multiple nodes were impacted. This, he said, should dispel doubts around the exchange’s redundancy provision.      Setting up a server location in Zurich does not mean the company will have to adopt any new know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements in Switzerland, Strijers clarified. (The Dutch exchange's infrastructure is hosted in the U.K. but its operations are now in Panama as part of DRB Panama Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dutch entity, created in early February.)    When code becomes a problem    It is not the first time a crypto exchange has sworn that some fundamental improvement it makes will avert new outages.      Earlier this year, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, suspended trading for more than six hours due to a “system messaging error.” Coinbase angered its users in May after it was forced to shut down its service due to a traffic spike.      Dave Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of execution provider CoinRoutes, told CoinDesk in a phone interview there are two main causes of technical outages at crypto exchanges.      One is a hardware failure, which was the problem that occurred at Deribit; the solution is to build a redundancy system. By now, most exchanges have built fully redundant systems, according to Weisberger, and as a result any outages caused by hardware failures are usually short-lived.      Read more: Coinbase Outlines Tech Plan to Help Avert Future Outages      The other cause, which is more common, is a change in a new piece of code that was not thoroughly tested. Bugs in the new code can be triggered at a later time by an unplanned situation such as a surge in trading volumes, resulting in an outage.    Traffic: When too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing    Derivatives exchange FTX’s support team also told CoinDesk via email that to reduce the risk of outages, their work has been concentrated on making sure enough spare capacity will be available to support the exchange's operation during busy periods.      Tushar Jain, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, told CoinDesk via Twitter that reducing outages caused by sudden traffic increases on exchanges is “doable,” but it will require time and money.      “Building software which scales to serve so many users is really hard and the operational work to make sure servers stay up and running is quite difficult,” he said. “There are many examples of software companies having trouble scaling to serve extremely high demand. Twitter’s “Fail Whale” is probably the most memorable example.”    Circuit breakers as a solution?    Because many of these outages are related to sudden spikes in trading volumes – sometimes resulting from extreme market volatility – some would argue circuit breakers could help exchanges resolve the problem.      Circuit breakers, which were first implemented on stock exchanges after the “Black Monday” crash in 1987, are automatic stoppages put in place when prices fall below specified levels. They are designed to save the market from a complete meltdown.      Read more: Does Crypto Need Circuit Breakers? Last Week’s Price Crash Ignites a Debate      Deribit already has an index circuit breaker on its platform which is triggered at +/-1.5% index price move per second to “avoid massive sell-offs, and allow market participants to get up to speed with the market during highly volatile periods,” according to Strijers.      “In the past, multiple derivatives exchanges have experienced flash crashes that have caused a cascade of liquidations and massive sell-offs,” he said. “Reasons have been various: an external market manipulation or internal error. To avoid this from happening, Deribit introduced a form of circuit breaker.”      Deribit’s circuit breaker was triggered a few times during the night of March 13 when bitcoin prices dipped to a 12-month low.      Read more: Bitcoin Price Briefly Dips to 12-Month Low in Overnight Trading      However, with hundreds of crypto exchanges available, the introduction of circuit breakers could hinder an individual exchange’s performance when its service is down for a period of time. During Binance’s outage earlier this year, for example, rival exchanges including OKEx and Bitstamp saw big jumps in trading orders.      FTX told CoinDesk it is not currently considering what it describes as “hard circuit breakers,” which would limit its users’ abilities to trade at some prices in the long term.      “These make a lot less sense,” the exchange wrote. “Rather than acting as a sanity check, they restrict users’ ability to trade and enforce artificial pricing.”      Jain, who previously was an advocate of circuit breakers, told CoinDesk he now doesn’t think this measure would solve exchanges’ outages. While prices for bitcoin and ether have been “relatively stable” recently, he said, outages still occur on exchanges.      Jain even interprets it as a positive sign: In a more stable market, outages caused by traffic spikes mean that more people are using crypto exchanges.      “I think this goes to demonstrate the level of demand in the crypto markets right now,” he said. “The last time I remember exchanges having problems like this was in early to mid-2017 when their servers just couldn't keep up with user growth.”    Crypto exchanges' unregulated downside    Some of the larger crypto exchanges may implement needed changes but without the threat of penalties from regulators if problems aren't fixed, fundamental improvements are less likely to occur anytime soon.      “The fact is that when you’re not penalized for these sorts of things, then you don’t spend as much money trying to fix it or prevent it,” Weisberger said.      Weisberger pointed out another similarity between mainstream trading platforms and the crypto exchanges: the ethos of the Silicon Valley or, rather, the whole of the tech industry. The people behind these platforms prioritize issues like liquidity and transaction fees rather than reducing outages simply because the financial cost outweighs the benefit.      “Is an uptime requirement of 99.999% something that the same type of people who invented Robinhood are going to aspire to?” Weisberger said. “The answer is no. They say they aspire to it but that’s very expensive. … As a result, there are outages.”      Robinhood, which is more heavily regulated than the crypto exchanges, is now reportedly under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for its handling of an outage in March.      If it gives them incentive to keep outages from repeating, regulatory oversight may end up being an asset for mainstream online trading.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/01/exchange-outages-are-going-mainstream-what-robinhood-can-learn-from-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe15ef3eaa222b5dc224ec3723821a594b293857-1500x871.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,970 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,524-$12,085  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin broke the $12,000 price barrier Tuesday, hitting $12,085 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. The last time the price hit that level was back on Aug. 21. While the Tuesday rally lost some steam, analysts are seeing some highly bullish signals in the crypto market.      Read More: Bitcoin Miners Saw 23% Revenue Increase in August      William Purdy, an options trader and founder of analysis firm PurdyAlerts, says recent weekly closes for bitcoin have been hitting new highs for 2020.      “Bitcoin’s weekly price is now consistently holding above the $11,500 pivot, which it has failed to do since March 2018,” Purdy said. “Four of the past weeks have closed above $11,500, unlike the late May 2019 run-up into $13,900, which continuously faced rejection at that price.”      Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, continues to be a fundamental driver for bitcoin, according to some stakeholders.

Read More: Ethereum Transaction Fees Set a Record Again      ""I am keeping a close eye on the ETH/BTC pair, as ETH is at a key level not seen since January 2019,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer for cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.      “With bitcoin just crossing that $12,000 resistance level and [ether] at dollar price levels not seen since June 2018, there is certainly bullish sentiment across the market,"" added OKCoin’s Lau.    Over $1.5 billion locked in Uniswap    As for ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was also up Tuesday, trading around $478 and climbing 8.9% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Ether Price Hits 2-Year High      The amount of value locked in the decentralized exchange Uniswap is now more than $1.5 billion, a whopping 462% from the paltry $280 million of only a week ago.

42422121,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKnYg,1598988965,'DogByte' Attack Found in 'Randomness' Protocol Proof for Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain,"Researchers at ZenGo have properly disclosed a vulnerability discovered in the Diogenes protocol proof. The proof is designed to provide the raw entropy for a Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) for the Ethereum 2.0 random beacon chain.    Ligero Inc., the team behind Diogenes, is redrafting the proof of the protocol to iterate away the vulnerability, according to a ZenGo blog post.  Entropy is a mathematical “randomness” that bolsters security for cryptographic functions.  Ethereum’s long-pending upgrade, Ethereum 2.0, calls for a random beacon chain to create entropy. This beacon chain has been called the “spine” of Eth 2.0 for its role in coordinating functions between Ethereum’s main blockchain and all of its smaller, derivative chains called “shard chains.”  VDFs are necessary for building a truly secure random beacon chain, ZenGo researcher Omer Shlomovits told CoinDesk.  Under an Eth 2.0 paradigm, the Diogenes protocol orchestrates so-called “ceremonies” to generate the entropy that creates the parameters for a random beacon’s VDF. Multiple parties are involved in the process (up to 1,024 participants).  Each participant who partakes in the ceremony only attains a piece of the “secret” – the cryptographic key that would allow attackers to interfere with the VDF’s “randomness”– so every one of the 1,024 participants would have to collude to piece together the full thing; Diogenes makes the fair assumption that at least one of these actors will remain honest.  The “DogByte” attack, as ZenGo calls it, would allow anyone who observes the protocol transcript, not just the ceremony participants, to learn the secret the ceremony creates.  With this secret, the attackers could theoretically “skew” or “bias the randomness generated in the beacon chain,” Shlomovits told CoinDesk. This could allow them to “gain an unfair advantage in all utilities that are built atop the random beacon chain,” such as gaming it for a higher chance to validate new Ethereum 2.0 blocks or cheating a smart contract that relies on entropy from the beacon chain.  This vulnerability is the second ZenGo has found in Diogenes’ design, and it’s part of an ongoing security audit of the protocol commissioned by the Ethereum Foundation and the VDF Alliance.  The first vulnerability involved “a potential attack vector that could have [given the attacker] backdoor access to [an] Ethereum 2.0 VDF” and required “the [VDF’s] central coordinator to collude with one of the participants,” ZenGo writes in their recent blog post.  Shlomovits emphasized ZenGo is working closely with Ligero Inc. on this research, adding that the “quality of the bug attests to the high quality of the project and the amount of scrutiny that is put into testing this protocol,” and that Eth 2.0’s burgeoning tech stack appears to be “highly resilient.”  A third blog on ZenGo’s findings is forthcoming.

Elyashiv told CoinDesk that Fusang will introduce SPiCE VC to global investors, family offices and institutions in Asia that the tokenized fund simply could not reach before.  Fusang informed CoinDesk that it will now facilitate SPiCE VC's second funding round in the token's nearly two-year history, becoming the Malaysian exchange's first-ever digital security alongside a tokenized hedge fund called Protos, which also listed on Fusang Tuesday.  SPiCE VC has previously told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it intends to raise up to $100 million through securities offerings. A company brochure dated March 31 states the fund manages $15 million.  The new listing adds an Asia-based exchange to SPiCE VC's two existing trading marketplaces: SharesPost and OpenFinance.  But the U.S.-centric pair “have not lived up to the promise of a marketplace that is active,” said Elyashiv, even if they had access to other jurisdictions. And neither marketplaces have the functionality of a full-service exchange.  He explained that SharesPost's digital securities route through its over-the-counter desk.  And he said that OpenFinance does not take asset custody, making for a complicated on-boarding process that he said restricts investors' access to liquidity. (SPiCE recently tapped Coinbase for custody services).  Fusang, meanwhile, has the licensure necessary to execute transactions on chain. ""This allows a trading experience that is very similar to what investors are used to from traditional exchanges (and digital asset exchanges),"" he said in an email statement. “They run a full book.""  ""Listing on Fusang provides our investors an additional liquidity option that is focused on Asian markets,"" Elyashiv said. SPiCE VC now trades across all three marketplaces.  The new listing is SPiCE VC’s latest attempt to pump liquidity into an asset class that seldom trades hands.  “Liquidity is the number one issue for [investors] in the VC industry,” Elyashiv said. “And we wanted to find a solution for that.”  SPiCE’s portfolio companies include Securitize, Bakkt and INX Exchange, which this week is proceeding with its long-awaited tokenized public offering.

42412082,Jc1GMXQv5gQ36DdOgFJD4D,1598981483,China's Digital Currency May Come With Hardware Wallets as Well,"Mobile apps may not be the only medium for storing and transacting China’s digital yuan, according to the Terms and Services agreement from a major Chinese bank. The roll-out of China’s central bank digital currency may include hardware wallets as well.      Over the weekend, China Construction Bank (CCB), one of the country’s big-four state-owned commercial banks, opened up a wallet service to public users within its mobile app for testing China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), also known as DC/EP.      While various nations are discussing the potential of CBDC to increase financial inclusion, China, the world’s second-largest economy, is poised to become the first country to digitize a sovereign currency.      Despite on-going tests in several Chinese cities, CCB did not seem prepared for the high level of attention to the wallet service on its mobile app service, which was activated widely before being disabled.      Read more: Chinese Bank Disables Digital Yuan Wallet After Soft Launch Draws Wide Attention      Before the service was taken down, CoinDesk kept a copy of and analyzed the Terms and Services that users were required to agree to follow when signing up.      The “Definition” part of the Terms, which has since disappeared along with the service, showed that apart from DC/EP wallets within CCB’s mobile app that was offered, separate hardware wallets for DC/EP may also be in the works.      One of the advantages of a national digital currency is that users can hold their own currencies digitally, rather than keep them in a bank. With the addition of a hardware wallet, users could keep custody of larger sums of their digital yuan off-line without relying on a third-party mobile app. Then they could make smaller transactions by using their DC/EP mobile app.      According to CCB’s Terms, a DC/EP hardware wallet is a physical medium that is activated upon users’ request at a bank’s counter or a digital channel for carrying DC/EP.      The idea would be similar to an actual wallet that stores physical cash. There is one key difference, however. The DC/EP hardware wallets can be traceable and would strip off the anonymity feature of paper cash as users would need personal information such as IDs and phone numbers to activate the wallet in the first place.      Basic functions will include making payments, depositing to or withdrawing from bank accounts and initiating transactions between wallets, the Terms added.      However, the Terms indicated China’s DC/EP wallets could be offered in the future in a four-tier system, which would potentially put a cap on how much users can spend their digital yuan.      Under the Terms, for instance, a user could only maintain a balance of up to 10,000 ($1,500) yuan in a tier-2 DC/EP wallet. The cap for a single transaction would be less than 5,000 yuan daily and annual accumulated spendings could not exceed 10,000 yuan (around $1,500) and 300,000 yuan (or $42,000), respectively.      Similarly, tier-3 and tier-4 DC/EP wallets would have tighter caps on wallet balances as well as daily and annual spendings but the Terms did not indicate if there will be any limit on tier-1 wallets.      After CCB disabled the DC/EP wallet registration, users who had made deposits to digital yuan over the weekend found their wallets dissolved, with balances credited to their respective bank accounts, according to Chinese state media.      CoinDesk reported last year that in addition to major Chinese commercial banks, payments giants Ant Financial and WeChat Pay have been involved in the development and implementation for China’s DC/EP initiative.      In fact, Ant Financial disclosed in its initial public offering prospectus in China last month that it has been participating in the development and internal test for the last two years.      “In accordance with the arrangements by the People’s Bank of China, the Company is preparing for DC/EP’s internal test in Shenzhen, Suzhou, Xiong’An, Chengdu and the upcoming 2020 Beijing Winter Olympics,” Ant Financial said in the document.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/01/chinas-digital-currency-may-come-with-hardware-wallets-as-well,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e9503b7f1eb7701f2d8baa351f0b1b9a6297267-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While recent user tests were promising, the commission concluded improvements are still needed regarding how voters are identified, Russian newspaper Kommersant reported Tuesday.      The e-voting system is built on the enterprise version of the Waves blockchain and was developed under the auspices of the state-backed telecommunications giant Rostelecom, as CoinDesk has reported. The blockchain's nodes will be hosted on the company's servers.      Despite the issues, the solution will be used for remote voting during by-elections for seats in the national parliament on Sept. 13 in two Russian regions: Kurskaya oblast and Yaroslavskaya oblast. About 15,000 people have already registered to vote electronically, and some 3,500 participated in the test, Ella Pamfilova, head of the Central Election Commission, told Kommersant.      See also: Russia’s New Blockchain Elections Remain Centralized      The solution is built with some technologies that have not been battle-tested yet, a source in the election commission told Kommersant. For example, the system uses homomorphic encryption, so votes remain encrypted until the voting is over. Only the final result can be then decrypted, they said.      However, the encryption tech poses a challenge for checking the identity of voters, a problem that still needs to be resolved.    Encryption approval    Sergey Prilutsky, cybersecurity expert and co-founder of blockchain startup MixBytes, said homomorphic encryption is indeed better than the type used during electronic voting in Moscow this summer. Even so, it could still potentially allow the authorities to meddle with the results if they control the list of voters, he said.      Waves Enterprise Chief Product Officer Artem Kalikhov told CoinDesk the system allows observers to watch how many electronic ballots have been issued in real time, helping prevent possible manipulation.      However, this type of encryption algorithm cannot currently be certified in Russia, meaning it can't pass the lengthy and complicated procedure necessary for government blockchain systems, Prilutsky said.      ""It uses elliptic curves that are not considered secure by the FSB,"" he said. The FSB is the Federal Security Service, a counter-intelligence agency in charge of certifying encryption tools in Russia.      Kalikhov said the solution has yet to be certified, though the company is working on it. Some other components of the system, like the electronic signature, have already been certified by the FSB, he said.      While the need to certify the homomorphic encryption aspect of the system could potentially hold up development, Kalikhov said it was unlikely to be an issue.      See also: Russia’s Crypto Mining Farms Would Have to Report to Government Under Proposed Bill      The Central Election Commission has already tested the blockchain voting system several times, according to Kalikhov said, but this was the first time real future voters were involved. Previous tests were run by Rostelecom and involved government staff, he added.

42412089,Jc1GMXQv5gQ36DdOgFJDJg,1598977270,New Malware Spotted in the Wild That Puts Cryptocurrency Wallets at Risk,"The Takeaway:    Anubis is a new malware that can target cryptocurrency wallets and other sensitive data. It first became available for sale in darkweb markets in June, and Microsoft has now seen limited attack campaigns using it.  Experts recommend not visiting sketchy websites or opening strange or suspicious attachments, links or emails.  Increasing interest cryptocurrencies, such as we’ve seen in recent months, usually sparks interest in new users who can be particularly susceptible to these kinds of attacks.    A new form of malware called Anubis is now out in the world after being circulated for sale on cybercrime dark markets in June, according to Microsoft Security Intelligence. Using forked code from Loki malware, Anubis can steal cryptocurrency wallet IDs, system info, credit card information and other data.      Importantly, this malware is distinct from a family of Android banking malware also called Anubis. It joins a growing list of malwares that look for vulnerable cryptocurrency stashes.      “The malware is downloaded from certain websites. It steals information and sends stolen information to a C2 (command and control) server via an HTTP POST command,” said Tanmay Ganacharya, partner director of security research at Microsoft.      HTTP Post is basically a data request from the internet. It is also used when you’re uploading a file or submitting a completed web form.      See also: Hacker Stole 1,000 Traders' Personal Data From Crypto Tax Reporting Service      “When successfully executed it attempts to steal information and sends stolen information to a C2 server via HTTP POST command,” he said. “The post command sends back sensitive information that may include username and passwords, such as credentials saved in browsers, credit card information and cryptocurrency wallet IDs.”    Avoiding Anubis: What we know    Parham Eftekhari, executive director of the Cybersecurity Collaborative, a forum for security professionals, reviewed the images of code tweeted out by Microsoft and said not much information about the Windows Anubis malware has been released.      But the Loki bot (from which the Anubis code was taken) was spread via social engineering emails with attachments with “.iso” extensions. These messages masqueraded as orders and offers from other companies and were sent to publicly available company email addresses, sometimes from a company’s own site.      When it comes to avoiding Anubis, Eftekhari said people should not open any attachments or emails that they are not expecting or that seem unfamiliar.      “They should deploy antimalware applications on their systems and scan and update frequently,” he said. “Finally, when accessing sensitive accounts such as banking applications, they should employ secure or privacy browsers which may prevent malware from recording keystrokes or screenshots.”      Ganacharya said that like many threats, this new malware tries to stay under the radar, so it doesn’t have obvious visual clues. Users can check for the presence of suspicious files and running processes (for example, ASteal.exe, Anubis Stealer.exe) as well as suspicious network traffic.      See also: Binance and Oasis Labs Launch Alliance to Combat Crypto Fraud and Hacks      For its part, Microsoft has updated its Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP) to detect Anubis malware and will be monitoring it to see if campaigns begin to spread. Microsoft Defender ATP uses AI-powered cloud-delivered protection to defend against new and unknown threats in real time      Other users should be wary of visiting unknown or suspicious websites, or opening suspicious emails, attachments and URLs, Ganacharya said. Additionally, users can turn on unwanted app blocking in Microsoft Edge to get protection against cryptocurrency miners and other software that can affect the performance of devices.      But for security professionals there are telltale signs when analyzing a system. One of these are indicators of compromise, which are indicators a system has been breached. These can include unusual outbound network traffic or unusual activity on an account.    Malware and cryptocurrency    While malware, or software designed to be malicious, isn’t new it’s increasingly being brought to bear on the cryptocurrency community.      “Over the past three years we have been seeing an increased number of malwares that target user computers that, aside from trying to record/steal passwords, are specialized in harvesting the victim’s system for cryptocurrencies,” said Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex.      Ardoino said tech-savvy holders of cryptocurrency usually use a hardware wallet and store their seed (the information that generates and recovers a wallet) offline. Less-experienced users, though, due to the fear of losing the seed for their wallet, might keep it stored on their computer. Malware is then able to access the password manager or other online storage site while the user is accessing it, and copy and paste passwords.      See also: Social Engineering: A Plague on Crypto and Twitter, Unlikely to Stop      Another attack that malware can execute, according to Ardoino, is seeing if the computer runs a blockchain node that has an unprotected wallet file. Even if that wallet file has a password, if the malware involves a keystroke recorder (or keylogger) it can capture whatever a user on the computer types.      He said there are many nuances, but as cryptocurrency gets closer to mass adoption, sloppy custodial practices could make people’s cryptocurrency wallets easier to target than banks or even credit cards.      Upticks in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), like those we’ve seen in recent months, could spark interest in new users who can be particularly susceptible to these kinds of attacks.    Pandemic poses new vulnerabilities    The threat of malware has only increased as people have been pushed toward working and living remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, increasing the amount of time they spend online and the number of systems they use.      See also: These Illicit SIM Cards Are Making Hacks Like Twitter’s Easier      According to a recent report from Malwarebytes, a company specializing in combating malware, programs such as AveMaria and NetWiredRC, which allow for breaches like remote desktop access and password theft, have seen huge increases in use during the pandemic. They found AveMaria saw a bump of 1,219% from January to April compared to 2019; NetWiredRC observed a 99% increase in detections from January to June, primarily targeting businesses.    Is the obvious defense the best defense?    Paul Walsh, CEO of the cybersecurity company MetaCert, said that given the attack vectors identified, traditional models for identifying and protecting against these attacks are misguided.      The vast majority of malware is delivered via email phishing and malicious URLs, which outnumber dangerous attachments (like Anubis) five to one, according to Walsh.      “Most security issues that involve dangerous URLs go undetected and, therefore, [are] not blocked” he said.      See also: YouTube’s Whac-a-Mole Approach to Crypto Scam Ads Remains a Problem      There are thousands of security vendors in the world, but only a small number own their own “threat intelligence systems” – a fancy term for a big database of threats and potential threats. Those companies license that data to other companies. While Walsh’s company Metacert has a threat intelligence system, they might have URLs that Google, for example, won’t. It’s a patchwork solution at best.      And if people are tailoring spear-phishing attacks for a specific company, the damage is usually done quite quickly, before a security database or firm might be aware a tailored website exists.      The lifespan, or the time frame within which a phishing attack has accomplished its goal, is about seven minutes, said Walsh. But security companies may take up to two or three days to identify and vet new phishing attacks, particularly if they are tailored for a company or individual.      Walsh says strong passwords and two-factor authentication are important. Yubikey, essentially a hardware version of two-factor authentication, is one step up, but it’s not supported by all websites.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/01/new-malware-spotted-in-the-wild-that-puts-cryptocurrency-wallets-at-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa887258485c30cb5dd6aaf02a9de5b9487025db-2560x1704.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412096,Jc1GMXQv5gQ36DdOgFJDWw,1598976277,"Blockchain Bites: Patoshi's Patterns, Canaan's Losses, DeFi's 'Weird' Moment","Decentralized exchange volume recorded a third straight monthly high, Coinbase’s boardroom was mixed up ahead of a potential public listing and Tezos settled a class action asserting its $232 million ICO was an unregistered securities sale.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    DEX wrecks? August trading volume on decentralized exchanges set its third consecutive monthly record high after climbing 160% from July, according to Dune Analytics. Aggregate trading volume on decentralized exchanges reached $11.6 billion in August, up from $4.5 billion in July as the intense enthusiasm for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications continued to spread. Leading decentralized exchange platform Uniswap reported a 283% volume increase in August, reaching $6.7 billion after topping its July record less than two weeks into the month, as CoinDesk previously reported. Along with aggressive volume growth, Uniswap reported an almost 100% increase in the total trading pairs listed on the platform, totaling 6,867 as of Monday.      Unlicensed action? The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is forging ahead with a plan to offer national banking charters to payment firms that don’t take deposits, easing the way for businesses like Stripe and Coinbase to become licensed. Acting Comptroller of Currency Brian Brooks, a Coinbase alum, is spearheading the move that would empower payment firms to operate across state lines with a single set of consolidated rules, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports. The move is drawing heavy criticism from entrenched interests: ""A few months into his service in an acting capacity, a bank regulator (and former cryptocurrency lawyer) pushes ahead with a legally dubious plan to give tech companies banking charters,"" tweeted Graham Steele, director of the Corporations and Society Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business.      Boardroom shakeup Coinbase has added legendary investor Marc Andreessen of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Gokul Rajaram, a DoorDash executive, to its board of directors – replacing outgoing board members Chris Dixon and Barry Schuler. Andreessen, whose tech-focused venture firm manages $12 billion in assets, will operate as a board observer while Rajaram, who oversees Caviar, will become a board director, according to a Monday blog post. The high-profile board additions bring major boardroom clout to the one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. and comes as Coinbase is reportedly considering going public, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reports.      Canaan’s quarter Canaan Creative reported a 2Q net loss of $2.38 million, or 10 cents a share. That’s less than half the size of Q1’s $5.64 million loss, as revenue rose more than 160% to $25.2 million. The Hangzhou, China-based company also reported cash and cash equivalents worth $22.2 million, down 40% from $37.3 million at the end of Q1. The company cited an increase in short-term investments for the lower cash on hand, and declined to issue forward guidance due to economic uncertainty. Canaan has traded on the Nasdaq since November 2019 after abandoning plans for an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Since its listing, Canaan shares have dropped nearly 85%, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports.      Tezos settled A long-running lawsuit alleging the $232 million 2017 Tezos initial coin offering (ICO) was an unregistered securities sale has been settled. The Swiss-based Tezos Foundation agreed Friday to pay $25 million in cash to settle the case. (Project founders Arthur and Kathleen Breitman are named as parties but their representative told CoinDesk the nonprofit is footing the entire bill.) The class action will pay out for those who invested in the Tezos ICO but did not make a profit. While the case centered around a securities law violation, the court has not ruled on whether the Tezos ICO was an unregistered securities sale.

While it cannot be proven, many think this early miner – code-named Patoshi – is Bitcoin’s creator, who went by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Lerner’s research raises questions about Nakamoto’s motivations – often looked to as a beneficent and ideologically driven coder.      “If we take for granted that Patoshi is, in fact, Satoshi, then it’s conceivable that Bitcoin’s creator used this advantage to prevent mining attacks on the nascent network,” CoinDesk’s Colin Harper reports.      While the “Patoshi pattern” has been known for years, Lerner has discovered the mechanics behind it. He now thinks Patoshi likely used multi-threading, a way to boost a CPU to sweep for multiple nonces at once, at a time when other miners were unaware of this solution.      While this means Patoshi mined significantly more blocks than other miners in the early days – the total hoard is estimated to be 1.1 million BTC – Lerner thinks it was a strategy to keep the nascent system alive.      Multithreading could pick up the slack when blocks were not being mined on schedule, and dialed down when the system functioned properly.      In June, Lerner pointed out that Patoshi “reduced his hashrate in several steps during the first year” and that it’s likely he turned off his miner for five-minute intervals each time he mined a new block.      Patoshi took these measures, Lerner posits, to foster healthy competition and to make sure he didn’t hog all the new blocks.      “The research on how Patoshi proceeded to decentralize Bitcoin taught me a lot about ideals,” Lerner said. “The first Bitcoiners were believers who cared a lot less about money that we all care now. Most of them mined to help the project see how far it could grow against all odds. Most of them donated bitcoins, received and paid with bitcoin to show its potential and never bother to speculate. Some of them mined just for fun.”    Market intel    Ether’s gains Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, jumped to two-year highs on Tuesday, taking its year-to-date gains to 260%. The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, ETH was trading at $470 at press time – a level last seen in July 2018. Prices are up more than 100% this quarter alone, according to CoinDesk's ether price index. ""Ethereum's price increase shows it is one of the main altcoins leading the market,"" Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, told CoinDesk. Investors may be entering the crypto market via ether and decentralized finance protocols rather than bitcoin, which served as a gateway to crypto markets during the 2017 bull run, Peters said.      Derivatives competition Huobi Futures, the crypto derivatives unit of Huobi Group, said Monday it will offer trading in bitcoin options starting Tuesday, aiming to meet a surging demand from traders to hedge against risks in cryptocurrency markets. Options contacts on bitcoin (BTC) will be available for trading, starting from 10:00 UTC on Sept. 1. Currently, Deribit is the largest bitcoin options exchange by open interest and daily trading volume. The exchange accounts for more than 85% of total options trading volume of $136 million, according to data source Skew.

Op-ed    Crypto dollars Alejandro Machado, co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, has found that Venezuelans are turning to crypto dollars during a prolonged period of economic uncertainty. “Most U.S. banks don’t need Venezuelan customers to thrive, so they have been shutting down their accounts. This places an artificial limit to the growth, and even the maintenance, of digital dollar accounts that depend on traditional financial institutions. Accounts that are powered by cryptocurrency, and that are supported by dedicated firms, can be made to have much fewer user-facing requirements. A smartphone may be the only physical equipment a person needs to get an account,” he writes.      Inflation's effect on stablecoins Alexander Lipton, CTO of Sila, explores what the Federal Reserve’s changing stance on inflation might mean for stablecoins. “[I]n the long term it will have profound implications for the price of equities, oil, gold and cryptos, and, more broadly, to the modus operandi of the entire financial system… [opening] a real possibility for building the new economy based on programmable money and regularly complaint payment rails operating entirely (or mostly) outside of the existing banking system,” he writes.

42412088,Jc1GMXQv5gQ36DdOgFJDFG,1598973506,Ethereum Transaction Fees Set a Record Once Again as DeFi Becomes Even Pricier,"Ethereum transaction fees have soared to new all-time highs for the second time in three weeks, according to on-chain data analyzed by CoinDesk.    As of Tuesday, average and median transaction fees have skyrocketed to record highs of $10.33 and $5.68, respectively.  Average fees reached record highs of $6.04 on Aug. 13, as CoinDesk previously reported, while median fees stayed just below their all-time highs of $3.03.  Steep network fees are a “double-edged sword” for Ethereum, said Wilson Withiam, Ethereum analyst at Messari, in a private message with CoinDesk. “They can ward off potential users,” he noted. But rising fees also signify “an increase in network utilization and demand for block space.”  As fees increase, entities responsible for large on-chain transaction volume are searching for techniques to reduce pressure on the network.  For example, leading stablecoin tether (USDT), the second-largest consumer of Ethereum gas fees, will “investigate” the addition of an Ethereum-scaling technique called zk-rollups that allows transactions to be batched off-chain and reduce transaction pressure on the network.  “The idea behind zk-rollups is aggregating multiple operations (transfers, smart contract calls, ...) into one single L1 transaction that ‘compress’ all the underlying transactions,” Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino said in an email to CoinDesk. “Zk-rollups are at the moment the most comprehensive L2 solution for the Ethereum scalability problem.”  As transaction fees continue to increase, largely caused by the continued explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi), this is causing DeFi to “slowly become a game reserved for the wealthy,” Withiam said.

42412094,Jc1GMXQv5gQ36DdOgFJDUj,1598966610,You Think Crypto Isn't Ready to Be Money? Consider the Coin Shortage,"J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and was a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.      Cryptocurrency is still a new endeavor. People who use it aren't too surprised when things go wrong. Ethereum Classic has suffered from three 51% attacks in one month. It costs $6 just to make a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain.      But all of these malfunctions pale in comparison to the breadth of the system error that has hit one of the oldest monetary projects in the U.S., the nation's coin system. As we speak, the U.S. is experiencing a country-wide shortage of cents, nickels, dimes and quarters.      Since mid-June, anyone handing over a $5 or $10 bill to buy $4.92 or $9.79 worth of goods has not been receiving the 8 cents or 21 cents in change that is due to them. Retail workers behind the till just don't have enough coins to give out.      See also: JP Koning - What Bitcoin Can Learn From Gold About Staying ‘Clean’      Signs have sprung up in stores all across the U.S. asking shoppers to either pay with the correct amount of change or use a card. Grocery giant Kroger requests its customers consider rounding up their bill and paying the proceeds to Zero Hunger Zero Waste, its non-profit charity, or to put the balance due on a gift card. The grocery chain blames the Federal Reserve, which is ""currently experiencing a coin shortage."" Similar signs have sprung up at McDonald's, Dairy Queen, Lowe's, Walmart and more.      Businesses that depend on coins are especially hard-pressed. Residents of apartment buildings with coin-operated laundry machines, desperate for change, have been raiding local laundromats for quarters. Laundromat owners are begging non-customers to stay away, some going so far as to install security cameras and hire attendants 24/7.      CoinDesk readers can be excused for failing to notice the coin shortage. Cash usage has been steadily falling over the last decade. According to the Federal Reserve's 2019 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice, about one in six Americans do not hold any cash at all.      But millions of Americans still use banknotes and coins to make daily payments. The Federal Reserve's study on payment choice finds that 26% of all payments are still made with the stuff. Those under 25 and the elderly tend to be the most intensive cash users. According to another Federal Reserve report, the 2019 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice, low-income Americans are the most cash-dependent demographic.    There can never be shortages of digital versions of the dollar because tokens flow rapidly over the internet, not slowly via hand.    It seems odd that an advanced nation such as the U.S. could be experiencing a shortage of change. Coin shortages were common in the medieval ages, especially shortages of low denomination copper coins, which weren't profitable for mints to produce. ""Moneyers preferred to strike high denominations to low ones... and were apt to leave the public desperately short of small change,"" wrote historian Peter Spufford.      But it's 2020, not 1620. We're supposed to have this down pat.      I’d argue that the U.S. coin shortage is not actually a shortage. The U.S. has all the coins it needs. The problem is that the coins are located in the wrong place.      According to the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, there are around $47.8 billion worth of coins in circulation. (About the same market capitalization of Ethereum.) That's $140 in coins per American. The U.S. Mint only produces around $750 million worth of coins each year, which is a tiny flow compared to the billions of dollars in coins already out there.      There is a life cycle to a coin. A retailer like Kroger orders five-cent coins from its bank. It pays out a nickel as change to Jack. Jack keeps the nickel in a change jar for a week or a month, eventually bringing his stash to deposit in his bank account. Or he may drop it into a local Coinstar machine, Coinstar shipping his 5-cent piece to its bank. At which point Kroger can ask its bank for more change and get the nickel back.      According to the Georgia Bankers Association, about 82% of the banking system's coin supply in any given month comes from recirculating coinage – folks like Jack. Only 18% of coin supply is freshly made by the U.S. Mint.      The arrival of COVID-19 and ensuing shutdowns has caused a larger-than-normal share of the nation's coins to be frozen up in people's homes, cars and pockets rather than making its way back into the distribution system. Why? I think this dislocation can be blamed on the combination of fear about catching the virus and the general slowness of counting out coins.      There is an asymmetry in the cash user experience. It is almost always faster to pay with paper money and get change than to count out and pay with the correct amount of notes and coins. We've all experienced this as we wait in the checkout line for the person in front of us to dutifully count out her change.      But these days, speed is vital. Anyone who buys essentials with cash wants to minimize time spent in confined spaces for fear of catching the coronavirus. And so my guess is that when habitual cash-users went shopping during the first months of the pandemic, they no longer bothered to bring change with them. Far quicker to pay a $19.96 Kroger bill with a $20 bill (and get 4 cents back in change) than laboriously count out a $10, a $5, four $1 bills, three quarters, two dimes and a penny. So, Kroger and other retailers quickly found their tills were losing coins at a far faster pace than they were being replenished.      This same fear factor would have inhibited cash-using customers from depositing their coin hoards at banks or in their local Coinstar machine, many of which are located inside grocery stores. Far safer to accumulate coins for an extra month or two than risk spending time indoors to deposit coins.      The government is doing its best to counteract this fear. The Federal Reserve has convened the U.S. Coin Task Force, a group that will try its best to reduce virus-related disruptions. Dave Ryder, director of the U.S. Mint, recently asked Americans to help get coins moving by taking coins to banks and coin kiosks. Likewise, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has taken to Twitter to beg Americans to mobilize their coins.      These are decent efforts. But at some point the U.S monetary authorities will have to explain why the U.S. is the only developed country to suffer from a coin shortage. Canada, the U.K., Europe, Japan, nor Australia have not experienced coin shortages.      My guess is the U.S. government's fumbling of its coronavirus response has led to prolonged anxiety on the part of American citizens relative to other countries. And so the U.S. coin supply has suffered from more dislocations than, say, Germany's or Japan’s coin supply.      The physicality of the coin problem perplexes cryptocurrency fans. When Treasury Secretary Mnuchin tweeted out his impassioned call for coins to circulate, Chris Giancarlo, director of the Digital Dollar Project, responded, ""A Digital Dollar would solve this problem."" Giancarlo is right. There can never be shortages of digital versions of the dollar because tokens flow rapidly over the internet, not slowly via hand.      But in the short term a digital dollar is no fix to the current coin problem. Given that 26% of all payments in the U.S. still use physical cash, the only solution to the current coin shortage is to unfreeze immobilized coins. Without a mass migration of coins from homes to Coinstar machines and banks, Krogers and other retailers will continue having problems providing enough change to their customers.      I think that this will only happen as fear about contracting the coronavirus lets up, and people once again feel comfortable slowly counting out change in grocery aisles.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | ETC | FIAT | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/01/you-think-crypto-isnt-ready-to-be-money-consider-the-coin-shortage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bd57fa52a82c62c1048d1f8cb4c2c8d08e79184-2048x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency climbed 2.6% in August, underperforming the 25% gain notched by the second-biggest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH).      For a comparison with traditional markets, the Standard & Poor's 500 climbed 7% during the month, the best August since 1986. And gold, which garnered headlines when it pushed to a new record price above $2,000 an ounce, ended the month down 0.4%.    Market Moves    Bitcoin? Yawn. In August, the hottest returns for crypto traders came from the fast-expanding and often brain-exploding realm of decentralized finance, known as DeFi.      Among digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion, the just-released-last-month yearn.finance (YFI) token jumped eight-fold to claim the top spot. UMA (UMA), a trustless financial-contracts platform, rose five-fold, according to the data firm Messari.      Chainlink, an ""oracle"" protocol that provides price feeds for DeFi platforms, saw its LINK tokens double during the month. Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, upon which most DeFi applications are built atop, surged 87% in August, leaving prices more than triple where they started the year.      Obscure Ethereum-oriented tokens are overtaking ""competitors which dominated the leaderboard a few years ago,"" the data firm Glassnode wrote Monday in a report. ""The innovation network around DeFi means that there is a constant source of new and lucrative financial games to play, while Bitcoin has seen little growth in terms of its value proposition or ecosystem.""      John Willock, CEO of digital-asset liquidity firm Tritum, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey on Monday that “this looks like a perfect storm of high optimism for these protocols and recent innovations introduced that are proving they have long-term value.” The decentralized exchange Uniswap boasted a trading volume of $560 million on Sunday, exceeding that of the big cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Cawrey reported.      ""There is no denying that DeFi is a thing,” said George Clayton, managing partner at Cryptanalysis Capital.      Some of the DeFi projects, with names like Yam and Spaghetti, might be dismissed as flukes or gimmicks if there weren't so many millions, hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars flowing in and out of them.      In July, when the YFI token went live, Yearn.Finance's creator, Andre Cronje, described it as ""completely valueless.""      In the words of CoinDesk's Brady Dale in an article Monday: ""DeFi has made a pivot to what might be called Weird DeFi: a set of difficult-to-parse projects whose larger value to the ecosystem is suspect at best and whose community is at least 20% driven by inside jokes.""      None other than BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes acknowledged in a monthly newsletter on Aug. 27 that he was ""yield-farming"" – using DeFi projects to earn token rewards – since the local nightclubs are currently closed.      ""While I deride many of these projects as activity resulting in economic waste, there is an underlying proto-banking infrastructure that is being built on the rails of Ethereum and other protocols,"" Hayes wrote. ""Crypto capital markets are the best place to earn serious positive yields if you are willing to take some modicum of risk.""      Hayes added that he fully expects to ""lose most of all the money I 'invest' into any of these projects,"" but that he views the ""destruction"" of his own capital as the ""only way to learn.""      When he figures it out, maybe he can explain to everyone else why YFI octupled in August.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin is closing on a breakout above $12,000 amid ether’s price rally to fresh two-year highs.      The top cryptocurrency’s options market shows increased demand for call options (bullish bets) at $12,000 strike. This signifies a more bullish move in the short-term, according to Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      “From a macro level, the U.S. dollar has continued to fall since Jackson Hole, creating further buying pressure on bitcoin and broader safe haven commodities such as gold,” Dibb told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.      Meanwhile, ether’s price rally looks to have legs as exchange deposits have declined to the lowest level since March, a sign of investors shifting to long-term holding strategies.      - Omkar Godbole    Token Watch    Ether (ETH): Price hits two-year high as exchange deposits decline, seen as a bullish sign.

At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading near $11,900 – up 2% on the day. Prices reached a high of $11,964 early Tuesday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major currencies, is currently trading 0.4% lower at 91.75, the lowest level since April 2018. The greenback is down more than 10% from highs seen in Mach.  ""From a macro level, the U.S. dollar has continued to fall since [the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole meeting], creating a further buying pressure on bitcoin and broader safe-haven commodities such as gold,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  Investors are selling dollars, possibly on bets that interest rates in the U.S. would remain low for a long time.  The Federal Reserve now has the room to hold rates low for a prolonged period, having signaled tolerance for high inflation last week.  U.S. inflation expectations have continued to strengthen since Fed Chair Jerome Powell's inflation speech at Jackson Hole last week.  The 10-year breakeven inflation rate, or the bond market's expectation of price pressures over the next ten years, rose to 1.8% on Monday, the highest level since Jan. 2, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Long-term inflation expectations have more than tripled in the past 5.5 months to 1.8%.  Additional bullish pressure for bitcoin may be stemming from ether's rise to two-year highs near $470.  ""Bitcoin is showing significant strength today on the back of recent gains in ethereum and the broader alternative cryptocurrencies,"" Dibb said, citing increased buying in the $12,000 call option expiring in September as evidence of the market's short-term bullish mood.  The Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel that ""there was a flurry of put buying on Monday and more of such hedging flows may be seen in the next weeks if bitcon is held below $12,500.""

42412091,Jc1GMXQv5gQ36DdOgFJDLt,1598965262,Government of Bermuda Pilots Stimulus Token in Response to COVID-19 Crisis,"Bermuda wants to use a digital token to stimulate its economy.      The government of Bermuda announced Tuesday it has started a pilot program for a digital stimulus token in partnership with local private payments platform Stablehouse, which is expected to provide initial feedback on the viability of digital tokens in facilitating the purchase of essential products and services.      In 2019, Bermuda began developing a blockchain-based digital ID system and announced the public could pay their taxes with USDC stablecoins. The development of the stimulus token kicked off later in the year as part of the government’s larger initiative to create a comprehensive crypto ecosystem on the island that supports the adoption of digital currencies. According to a statement, the plans for the token were accelerated as the COVID-19 pandemic created the need to quickly distribute financial aid to the population.      National governments around the world are evaluating the potential benefits or drawbacks of a blockchain-based payments system, whether that looks like a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or a similar payment rail. China has proceeded the furthest with launching its own blockchain-based currency, going so far as to softly launch a wallet service over the past weekend (though it was quickly taken down).      “Our ultimate goal is to get a wallet on every phone in Bermuda,” Denis Pitcher, chief fintech adviser to the Premier of Bermuda, told CoinDesk.    The perfect model    According to Pitcher, Bermuda’s government saw the challenges in trying to distribute unemployment checks to people when the island went into rapid lockdown, and highlighted the need to get funds to the unbanked population quickly.    Bermuda’s high technology penetration (with around 99% of the population being active internet users, and 87% of the total population using mobile internet in 2019) combined with its small population (of just over 71,000https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_bd.html people) makes it an ideal small-scale testing ground for digital payments, Pitcher said.    Read more: Banking the Unbanked: How the Crypto Community Can Make a Big Impact      In Pitcher’s view, Bermuda also has the infrastructure to back it up. After World War II, British and U.S. militaries had bases on the island, and they built key infrastructure from airports and hospitals to power infrastructure, Pitcher said.      “So you really have the perfect environment to say, how do you get real-world interactions with grocery stores, utility companies, governments and the average citizen for mainstream adoption and improve user experiences so that you can then repeat it in a city with millions or a country with hundreds of millions,” Pitcher said.      The pilot token is based on Blockstream’s Liquid blockchain protocol while the Greenwallet app will enable payments via a point-of-sale terminal provided by Stablehouse. The token is being tested in three locations with a select group of consumers and merchants, and there are plans to expand testing, Pitcher said.    No to CBDCs    When the pandemic drove interest in exploring the digitization of the U.S. dollar as a faster method of delivering stimulus funds to the public, Bermuda was inspired to be among the first in the world to offer financial aid to its citizens in the form of tokens.      However, since then the discussion around the tokenization of the U.S. dollar has become synonymous with the creation of a CBDC, but Bermuda is not interested, according to Pitcher.      Read more: CFTC Seeks Industry Advice on Blockchain Applications      “We're not particularly interested in creating a unifying technical solution that's going to solve all problems at digitizing money for a country, because it's hard to see how that really can exist,” Pitcher said.      Instead, the Bermudan government is engaging private licensed entities such as Stablehouse to issue tokens on its behalf.      “The private sector is the best place to create solutions for these problems, because they're moving fastest with the technology,” Pitcher said.    Banks are out (for now)    According to Pitcher, local banks will not play a critical role in the stimulus pilot, mainly because they are beholden to correspondent banking relationships that dictate what they can do.      “We do have some challenges with local banking at the moment in terms of a willingness to bank the digital asset industry,” Pitcher said.      In his view, banks struggle to stay on top of tech innovation partly because of regulation requirements. But the sector is in transition, Pitcher said, with stablecoins like USDC backed by fiat deposits creating a new role for banks.      Read more: Following OCC Letter Some US Banks Appear Open to Providing Crypto Services      “We see banks playing a role in acting as kind of core depository institutions, but allowing them to open source the tech components,” Pitcher said.      For now, the pilot is well underway, with the Premier David Burt participating in the test run, making mobile purchases with the stimulus token.      “Bermuda is keen to establish itself as a leader in supporting innovative private-sector digital asset solutions and to work with locally licensed companies to drive digital asset adoption. A key part of that is not just creating regulatory frameworks but also actually working with and using the products created by companies that choose Bermuda as their home,” Premier Burt said, in a statement to the press.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | USDC,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/01/government-of-bermuda-pilots-stimulus-token-in-response-to-covid-19-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3559680acf70509332242e5344664479da78d704-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Tuesday, Nuclearis, which is headquartered in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and has offices in the U.S. and China, is using the Bitcoin-powered RSK blockchain as an immutable anchor, keeping tabs on critical documents. The firm has open-sourced the framework so other players in the nuclear industry can use it.      It’s not the first time blockchain tech has been leveraged within the nuclear industry. Estonia’s Guardtime has been using its own version of DLT for some time to distribute data as a way to prevent cyberattacks on nuclear infrastructure. There have also been projects using blockchain to track the uranium fuel supply chain and also track what happens to nuclear waste.      Read more: No More Nuclear: Japan’s Biggest Utility Turns to Blockchain in Power Pivot      Safety is everything when it comes to nuclear. The track and trace use case for manufacturing documents is important because there have been forgeries in the past, where antiquated nuclear reactors have opted for shortcuts to revamp equipment (a high-profile case of this sort went through the courts in France in 2016.)      Some 150 new reactors are set to be built over the next 30 years and the “NuclearTech” space is all about instilling trust within the operators of nuclear power plants, said Nuclearis CTO Sebastian Martinez.      “Part of the problem is that there are many intermediaries in this supply chain and parts of it are still paper-based,” said Martinez. “We hash the manufacturing documents and upload to the blockchain at the point of creation of the steel part. Months or even years later, when we deliver the part, the power plant can check if everything digitally matches.”    Nuclear in Argentina    Nuclearis, which is working with Argentina’s three power plants – Atucha I, Atucha II and Embalse – said the Argentine government and the country’s main operator of nuclear power plants, Nucleoeléctrica Argentina, are looking to adopt its blockchain system.

International bank HSBC, Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Singapore government-owned investment firm Temasek said Tuesday their pilot for the DLT-based bond – first mentioned in November – had been successful.  Per an announcement, S$400 million (around $294 million) worth of 5.5-year corporate bonds from Olam International – one of the world's largest coffee bean, rice and cotton suppliers – were issued on SGX's digital asset platform.  SGX said the pilot showed DLT could streamline issuances and minimize settlement risk in the Asian bond market.  The Asian Development Bank estimated in March that the region's local currency bond market was worth approximately $16 trillion last December, up 12.5% on the year before.  The digital bond used smart contracts to codify rights and obligations, as well as its maturity, into the bond itself.  An on-chain payments solution from HSBC was also used to facilitate settlement in multiple currencies, as well as to transfer funds to Olam International.  Olam, which is listed on SGX, has held back a further S$100 million (roughly US$74 million) in the digital bonds for issuance at a later date.  SGX plays host to one of Asia's largest bond markets and says it has issued over a $1 trillion in debt securities so far.  Lee Beng Hong, the SGX senior managing director responsible for the pilot, said the exchange is now moving to fully digitalize corporate bond issuances on its platform.

42412098,Jc1GMXQv5gQ36DdOgFJDZ9,1598957307,Ether Price Hits 2-Year High,"Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, jumped to two-year highs on Tuesday, taking its year-to-date gains to 260%.    The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, ETH was trading at $470 at press time – a level last seen in July 2018.  Prices are up more than 100% this quarter alone, according to CoinDesk's ether price index.  As ether rose by 10% in the past 24 hours, bitcoin added 3% and is currently trading near $11,940.  Other prominent coins from the CoinDesk 20 including XRP, Stellar XLM, litecoin, bitcoin cash and Chainlink's link token have all rallied by 2%-5% in the past 24 hours.  ""Ethereum's price increase shows it is one of the main altcoins leading the market,"" Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, told CoinDesk in an email.  Investors may be entering the crypto market via ether and decentralized finance protocols rather than bitcoin, which served as a gateway to crypto markets during the 2017 bull run, Peters said.  On-chain metrics suggest ether's price rally has legs.  To start with, exchange deposits – the number of coins held in exchange addresses – declined to 17.99 million ETH on Monday, the lowest level since March 11, according to data source Glassnode.  Exchange balances have also reduced by over 5% in the past four weeks.  ""Investors are holding onto ether as a value holder during times when inflation is on the rise,"" Glassnode tweeted.  Investors typically move coins off exchanges to their own wallets when they expect prices to rally.  Additionally, the recent price gains look to have been fueled by strong hands.  ""The top 100 non-exchange addresses have increased bags by +8.2% in just 35 days – a bullish sign,"" blockchain analytics firm Santiment tweeted Monday.  The options market, too, is biased bullish on ether with the one-, three- and six-month put-call skews hovering below zero, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.  That's a sign of call options, or bullish bets, drawing higher prices than puts, or bearish bets.  Put-call skews have declined sharply today with ether's rise to fresh two-year highs above $450.  Markets now expect ether to face increased volatility over the next four weeks, with one-month implied volatility increasing from 77% to 91% early Tuesday.

The Swiss-based Tezos Foundation, as well as the project's founders, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, agreed to settle the case Friday.  While the Breitmans were involved parties, the Tezos Foundation paid the entire settlement amount of $25 million, according to the couple's representative, Jared Levy.  The presiding judge ratified the settlement agreement – which was first proposed in March – the same day.  The complaint, a class action for those who invested in the Tezos ICO, alleged defendants violated U.S. securities law by hosting an unregistered sale.  Allegations were first brought against the Tezos Foundation in late 2017 – months after the ICO concluded.  Crucially, the settlement means the court has not ruled on whether the Tezos ICO was an unregistered securities sale.  In a separate filing, lead plaintiff Trigon Trading argued settlement actually saved both parties, and the court, much work determining the regulatory status of token offerings, like Tezos, and whether they counted as securities sales.  Per Friday's order, the plaintiff's attorneys will take more than $8.5 million, a third of the total settlement, in fees and expenses.  Save small awards to the lead plaintiff, Trigon Trading, and other key figures, the remaining $16.5 million will be divided among those who invested in the Tezos ICO and had a monetary loss.  Those who gained from their investment, through selling at a profit or staking (dubbed ""baking"") their XTZ tokens will not be able to claim damages.  Trigon described the $25 million settlement as an ""excellent result"" for Tezos investors.    See also: Tezos Foundation Offloaded Millions of Dollars Worth of Bitcoin in 2019: Report      UPDATE (Sept. 2, 19:35 UTC): An earlier version of this article stated that the Breitmans would pay part of the settlement, based on a passage in court documents.

42422098,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKaZN,1598951595,US Regulator to Shake Up Banking With Federal Charters for Payment Firms,"The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is forging ahead with a long-in-the-works plan to offer national banking charters to payment firms that don't take deposits, but not everybody is happy.    According to a Tuesday report by Politico, Acting Comptroller of Currency Brian Brooks is spearheading the move that would empower payment firms to operate across state lines with a single set of consolidated rules.  The charter would simultaneously enable such firms to expand their financial service offerings and avoid having to apply for licencing in each state individually.  Brooks told Politico the OCC would be ready by Tuesday to begin processing applications for the charters, which could potentially include companies like Paypal and Coinbase.  Brooks is a former executive of the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, having served as chief legal officer from September 2018 until his departure to the OCC – a position he has held for three months.  “I can supervise the payments activities of JPMorgan, but I can’t supervise the payments activity of Square,” Brooks said in Politico's report, referring to Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's payments platform. “That seems really weird to me.”  A spokesperson from the OCC told CoinDesk all charter applications would be made public with a comment period, but said they were not yet aware of any specific applications from payment firms.  The role of the OCC is to regulate, supervise, and provide a charter for national banks and federal savings associations operating in the U.S.  Brooks said the OCC was ""satisfied"" it doesn't need a new regulation or statute to move ahead with its decision.  However, the news has sparked outrage among traditional banks, credit unions and elsewhere, per Politico's report.  ""A few months into his service in an acting capacity, a bank regulator (and former cryptocurrency lawyer) pushes ahead with a legally dubious plan to give tech companies banking charters,"" tweeted Graham Steele, director of the Corporations and Society Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business.  The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has previously won the backing of a judge in blocking the OCC's plan for the ""Fintech Charter"" (first proposed in 2016) in the state.  Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the NYDFS, retweeted Steele's comment and pointed out that OCC's appeal of the ruling is still to take place.  U.S. states believe the OCC is stepping outside its remit in offering the new charter, according to Margaret Liu, deputy general counsel at the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.  Such issues haven't put off Brooks, who told Politico he saw the OCC's role more as a regulator of services than entities.
