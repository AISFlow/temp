25930720,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603687,1713394829,"XRP Whales Are On The Move Again, But Are They Bullish Or Bearish?","XRP could continue a price correction in the short term as recent price action has put it rebounding against a resistance level of $0.5. On-chain data has also revealed a row of transactions from whales of the cryptocurrency in the past 24 hours, but are they bullish or bearish on XRP? These large transactions have been a mix of both, although the trading volume of each transaction could point to them being bearish rather than bullish. XRP Whales On The Move Large XRP transactions, often indicators of whale activity, have spiked recently. XRP has seen some major whale movements over the past few weeks that point to a bearish sentiment among big players amidst a price correction for the cryptocurrency in the past seven days. However, while some of these big transfers are going into crypto exchanges for a potential selloff, some are also anonymous wallets shifting huge amounts of tokens from crypto exchanges into private wallets. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $650,000 Due To This Reason Whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts posted on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) instances of enormous transactions on April 16. The first notable transaction was the transfer of 158 million tokens worth $77 million from a private wallet into the crypto exchange Binance. This massive transfer into the exchange ignited worrying signs for holders hoping for a reversal from bearish momentum into a price surge. Similarly, there was a transfer of 28.9 million XRP worth $14.2 million into Bitstamp. On the other hand, Whale Alerts also indicated the outflow of XRP from Binance into private wallets. Particularly, the tracker noted the transfer of 100 million XRP, worth around $48 million, into private wallets. These transfers were made with three transfers in rapid succession, with each transfer of 33.33 million XRP worth $16.2 million. Interestingly, the tracker also noted the movement of large amounts of tokens on April 15. Overall, there were transfers of 457 million XRP worth over $234 million into crypto exchanges Bithumb, Bitvavo, and Bitstamp. The largest transaction was the transfer of 390 million tokens worth $201 million into Bithumb. What’s Next For The Altcoin? Whale transactions are very important in the world of cryptocurrencies. Prices could swing massively at any time based on the actions of a few big players. For regular XRP investors, these whale transfers highlight the volatility and uncertainty in the current price of XRP. At the same time, their movement into crypto exchanges is bearish, and they give investors a glimpse of the the altcoin’s price trajectory in the short term.

25927936,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603735,1713391259,ApeCoin Q1 2024 Performance: Market Cap And Token Price Skyrocket – Key Findings Inside,"ApeCoin (APE), the ERC-20 token governing the ApeCoin Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), showed notable growth in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. Key metrics showed significant progress, driving APE’s market capitalization, token price, and trading volume quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), demonstrating consecutive quarters of growth. ApeCoin Regains Unicorn Status As noted in a recent report by Messari, APE’s rebound was particularly noteworthy compared to the broader cryptocurrency market, which grew 53% quarter over quarter, and Bitcoin’s market cap, which grew 63% quarter over quarter. After briefly dipping below $1 billion in Q2 2023, APE’s market cap regained unicorn status, ending Q1 2024 at $1.3 billion, representing 31% growth. According to the report, this market value increase was partly driven by a 21% QoQ rise in APE’s token price. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Don’t Buy Altcoins Just Yet – Here’s Why The report also highlighted the unlock of 46.8 million APE tokens from the circulating supply, contributing to the market cap growth. However, this unlocks, and the $16.5 million allocated to governance expenditures potentially created sell pressure on the asset throughout the quarter. Another 46.8 million APE tokens were unlocked in Q1 2024, with 22 million APE going to the DAO Treasury and 24.8 million APE distributed to non-DAO entities. The DAO plans to issue or sell APE to fund approved proposals, while non-DAO entities are free to sell once their funds are unlocked. Despite the additional sell pressure resulting from unlocking and committing 8.3 million APE tokens, the price of APE still saw a substantial 21% QoQ increase. This surge in price indicated a higher volume of buy orders, exerting upward pressure on the asset. The report also analyzed trading activity, highlighting the dominance of large-volume traders (whales and sharks), who accounted for 63% of the trade volume in Q1. The average decentralized exchange (DEX) swap size increased by 28% QoQ, reflecting the heightened activity among larger-volume traders. Furthermore, the transfer volume of APE tokens grew by 12% QoQ, potentially driven by significant transactions following the approval of various governance proposals throughout the quarter. APE’s Journey Forward Looking ahead, APE’s utility is set to expand by implementing recently passed governance proposals. AIP-381 aims to build game-focused DAOs and vaults accessible exclusively to APE holders, allowing them to participate in governance and access specific ecosystem assets. Additionally, the ApeChain proposal selected Horizen Labs to build a blockchain that utilizes APE as a gas token and potentially supports other asset-related applications. However, while APE continued to attract new holders, the growth rate of new APE holders did not accelerate despite two consecutive quarters of price increases, according to Messari. To address this, ApeCoin DAO formed a branding partnership with a Formula One racing team, among other initiatives, to attract new holders in the future. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Unveils Top 10 BTCfi Altcoins Post-Halving On the other hand, the ApeCoin DAO has been actively voting on new governance proposals, approving the building of ApeChain on the Arbitrum technology stack and expanding the utility of the APE token to GameFi DAOs and vaults. The average votes per proposal increased by 19% QoQ, indicating growing community engagement. ApeCoin DAO plans to move the voting process on-chain more, promoting decentralization and participation in governance. Despite the overall growth witnessed by APE in Q1, the token has recently experienced a significant downturn, aligning with the downward trend in the overall market. APE has suffered a notable decline of over 41% in the past month, leading to its current trading price of $1.148.

25925392,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603725,1713387654,Are Altcoins Cooling Off? Analyst Weighs In On This Cycle’s Market,"Many investors expressed worries about the crypto market corrections during this cycle. Bitcoin’s price drop has dragged altcoins with them, and, as a result, a more pessimistic sentiment has started to brew among some sectors of the crypto community. Analysts and traders have reassured investors that the market fluctuations are a normal part of the journey. Some urge the community to look at the bigger picture, as altcoins remain above levels not seen in years. Related Reading: Traders Forecast Massive Rally For Altcoins, But Why Is Sentiment “Down”? Renowned crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa weighed in on the matter, exploring some of the reasons and differences that make this bull cycle different from the 2020s. Time For An Altcoins Cool-Off? In an X post, Altcoin Sherpa asserted that there’s a high possibility “that altcoins are done for the next 1-4 months.” The analyst considers that, right now, most of the market needs “time to chill out and consolidate after such a big run.” Despite recently falling below the $1 trillion market capitalization, altcoins have performed remarkably in the last few months. In 2024, cryptocurrencies’ market cap, excluding Bitcoin’s, has increased by 22.79%, according to TradingView data. Altcoins market cap has also considerably surged in longer timeframes, with a 91.31% and 52.46% jump in the last six months and the past year. This “big run,” as Sherpa called it, sits the cryptocurrency market at levels like those seen in 2022. However, what worries the crypto analyst is, despite the overall performance, “many alts didn’t even run that hard over the last few months.” He illustrated his point with Chainlink’s native token, LINK. Despite the +500 days of accumulation, LINK investors only got 3-4x gains depending on when they go in. Now, the token’s price is “strongly pulling back.” Expectations for altcoins during this cycle seemingly play a significant role in the current sentiment. As one X user pointed out, LINK was anticipated to be one of the biggest winners of this cycle, Sherpa replied that he “expected more lol.” The user playfully commented, “No dino coins and new and shiny coins are the better bet.” How Did The Market Change? The previous comment highlights what appears to be a significant difference between this bull run and the 2020s. Choosing your bag has become more difficult since the market has expanded significantly. Sherpa considers that “now more than ever, it is super important to choose the altcoins that are going to run hard.” In 2020, the massive altseason made “everything go up consecutively.” This time, the liquidity is more fragmented, and “only a few sectors are pumping.” The AI and memes sectors have been the hottest topic in 2024, and layer-1 (L1) tokens, like SEI, have also performed well. “Everything else? Not great,” remarked Sherpa. The massive number of tokens, both newly launched and old ones, are finding it more difficult to “capture mindshare/attention.” Regarding retail investors, the analyst is not surprised that the default choice is memecoins instead of “trying to learn about some DeFi veRewards type of stuff. Or Oracle or L1s or modular or anything else.” The analyst suggested investors “move to real value” like ETH and SOL. He also considers that big token launches, with significant money behind them, “have some real value.” These coins, as stated in the post, have the potential to “do very well” once Bitcoin stabilizes. Sherpa’s market analysis closes with a “pretty bearish” outlook for the following months. The growing difficulty in keeping user attention and “for people to become strong users/community members” for many projects has made the market a different playground. Ultimately, the analyst pointed out that “portfolio rebalances are necessary” and said he still believes this run is not over.

42418391,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgr2D,1713384365,Jury Begins Deliberations in $110M Mango Markets Fraud Trial,"NEW YORK — Crypto trader Avi Eisenberg’s fate now rests in the hands of 12 New York jurors, who have been tasked with deciding whether his October 2022 trades on Mango Markets – which netted him $110 million – were fair game or fraud.  On Wednesday, the jury heard closing arguments in the government’s case against Eisenberg, who was arrested in Puerto Rico in December 2022 and charged with commodities fraud, commodities manipulation and wire fraud in connection with his Mango Markets exploit two months earlier.  Eisenberg, 28, was clad in a dark gray suit. His mother and two other family members were in the gallery during the proceedings. Though his attorneys suggested he may testify earlier in the trial, his defense ultimately rested without calling him to the stand.  The defense’s case on Monday and Tuesday largely hinged on a single expert witness, former Secret Service agent-turned crypto investigations consultant Jeremy Sheridan. Over two days of testimony he spoke to the mechanisms that enabled Eisenberg’s trades and the difficulty of understanding whether his borrows were, according to Mango Markets’ codebase, actually borrows at all. But much of his testimony got thrown out by the judge after the court determined his knowledge of Mango Markets’ codebase was itself insufficient.  Prosecutors have argued that Eisenberg engaged in market manipulation, trading large sums of MNGO perpetual futures contracts between himself to pump the price over 1000%, then using his newly-created collateral to fool the platform into allowing him drain $110 million in various cryptocurrencies via the platform’s “borrow” function.  But Eisenberg wasn’t borrowing, prosecutors told the jury on Wednesday – he was stealing. Hours after the exploit, he issued an “extortionate” anonymous proposal to the Mango Markets decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) offering to return $67 million of his haul in exchange for promises not to pursue criminal charges or freeze the rest of the stolen funds.  The facts of the case were largely undisputed by Eisenberg’s defense team when they took the stand. Instead, Eisenberg’s lead attorney, Brian Klein, attempted to frame Eisenberg’s massive trades as a “successful and legal trading strategy” that “fully complied” with the Mango Markets protocol. Klein pointed to Mango Markets’ lack of Terms of Use – only a checkbox that told visitors to use the site “at your own risk” – at the time of Eisenberg’s exploit, arguing that he simply used the platform as intended and made a lot of money doing it.  “This is how people do things in this world of crypto,” Klein told the jury.  Klein is a well-known defense attorney in the crypto sphere, whose past clients include Erik Voorhees, Charlie Shrem and Virgil Griffith. Klein is also currently representing Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm.  Prosecutors told the jury a different version of the story. Eisenberg, they said, knew what he was doing was illegal.  Before his exploit, Eisenberg had sued someone else in federal court for manipulating the price of WAVES. He’d also made internet searches for things like “statute of limitations market manipulation” and “elements of fraud” before his October 2022 trades. After the trades – and once his identity as the exploiter had been exposed – Eisenberg bought a ticket for a flight to Israel and searched for “FBI surveillance,” “list of Israel extraditions” and “Otisville prison,” a white-collar federal penitentiary.  “That’s what you do when you think you’ve committed a crime,” the prosecutor told the jury.  Klein told the jury Eisenberg didn’t go to Israel to escape charges, but instead because angry Mango Markets’ users were threatening his safety. Klein also said that the fact that Eisenberg sued both Circle and AscendX, a nominally Romanian exchange, to get his money back once it was frozen – as well as his willing return to the U.S. – was further evidence that he did not believe he had committed a crime.  In their rebuttal, prosecutors said that Eisenberg’s legal attempts to get his money were made after his identity as the exploiter had been exposed. He thought that his proposal to Mango Markets’ DAO, and its subsequent “waiver of liability,” meant he was off the hook, emboldening him to come back to the U.S., they said.  “Manipulation, lies, deceit – it’s criminal, whether it happens on Wall Street or on a computer program,” the prosecutor said.  Eisenberg faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on all three counts.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Cheyenne Ligon, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/17/jury-begins-deliberations-in-110m-mango-markets-fraud-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/690686da6d02a137591ed111a8859af2bf78e838-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25923109,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603690,1713384025,Historical Trends Show What To Expect For Bitcoin Price Following The Halving,"The 2024 Bitcoin halving is only two days away, and there are already varying expectations of what might happen to the BTC price once the event is completed. One way to get an idea of how it could play out for the Bitcoin price, though, is through historical data and how the cryptocurrency has performed at times like these. Bitcoin Price Trends For Previous Halvings There have been three halvings so far since Bitcoin was first launched in 2009 and with each one, Bitcoin has demonstrated various reactions to the event. The first halving took place on November 28, 2012, the second happened on July 9, 2016, and the last one was on May 11, 2020. Related Reading: Arbitrum’s Massive $107 Million Token Unlock Threatens To Send Price Below $1 For the purpose of this report, only the last two halving will be referenced given that adoption had began to climb at the time that these two happened. The 2016 halving happened when Bitcoin was trading around $650, but in the weeks following the halving, the BTC price would drop another 30%, reaching as low as $460 before climbing back up once again. BTC price crashed 30% post-halving in 2016 | Source: Tradingview.com Then, during the 2020 halving, the BTC price was trending just under $10,000, and following the halving, would see a drop in price as well. However, this drop was not as significant as the 2016 drop, with the BTC price only falling around 15% during this time. BTC price crashed 15% post-halving in 2020 | Source: Tradingview.com This has formed quite a trend with the halving, where the Bitcoin price falls after the event, which is expected to be bullish. Therefore, if this trend continues, then BTC could see a sharp drop in price despite the expectation that the halving will be bullish for price. However, it is important to consider that subsequent halvings have seen a lower post-halving crash compared to their predecessors. So, if this holds this year, Bitcoin could still be looking at a crash but to a much lesser degree. For example, the 2020 post-halving crash was half of the 2016 post-halving crash, so holding this trend, the crash this time around could only be an around 7-8% crash. BTC Deviates From Established Halving Trends While the historical data does suggest where Bitcoin could be headed following the crash, it is also important to note that the digital asset has deviated from a number of pre-halving trends. One of these deviations is the fact that the Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high before the halving, something that has never happened before. This could suggest that there will be a complete deviation from these established trends, meaning that a crash may not follow the halving after all. Related Reading: XRP Price Set For 3,000% Rally To $22, Analyst Predicts Another deviation is that the few weeks leading up to the last two Bitcoin halvings have been green. However, in 2024, the last three weeks leading up to the halving have been red as the BTC price has been in decline. This also lends credence to the fact that there could also be a deviation from its post-halving trends. One thing to keep in mind though, is that the crypto market has always been uncertain and Bitcoin has a habit of doing what no one expected. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has seen a pull back from the extreme greed territory, but it continues to remain in greed, which means investors are still bullish. In this case, if Bitcoin were to do the opposite of what is expected, then it could follow the established trend and crash back down.

The next Bitcoin halving is set for ~April 19, 2024, bringing opportunities and uncertainties for the Bitcoin community. This event, built into Bitcoin's foundational code, changes the rewards for miners and could significantly influence Bitcoin's value and role within the broader ecosystem. The Bitcoin Halving Cycle Explained Bitcoin halving is a critical event in the world of Bitcoin that impacts investors and others involved with it. About every four years, the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is cut in half. This is done to control the supply of Bitcoin and make it more like scarce resources such as gold. The halving helps keep Bitcoin's value stable over time by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created. Bitcoin halving was introduced by its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, to control inflation and ensure the digital currency remains a deflationary asset. Initially, miners received 50 bitcoins as a reward for processing transactions and supporting the blockchain network. After the first halving in 2012, this reward was cut to 25 bitcoins, and it has halved subsequently at regular intervals, with the reward decreasing further each time. A History of Bitcoin Halvings Bitcoin's halving history is interesting, showing its growth from its beginnings in 2009. Since then, Bitcoin has experienced several halving events, each one playing a big part in its development. The first halving (November 2012): The inaugural Bitcoin halving occurred when the network reached 210,000 blocks. The mining reward was reduced from 50 to 25 bitcoins per block. This event marked the first test of Satoshi’s theory of controlled money supply and deflationary economics. Despite initial uncertainties, the Bitcoin network remained stable, and the aftermath saw the price of Bitcoin catapult from $10.59 to $126.24 within 180 days, reinforcing the viability of its underlying economic principles. The second halving (July 2016): With bitcoin firmly established in the public consciousness, the second halving reduced the block reward to 12.5 bitcoins. This period saw the rise of cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment class, with increasing participation from both retail and institutional investors. Following this halving, bitcoin experienced a significant rise, peaking at over $1002.92 and laying the groundwork for the bull run of 2017. The third halving (May 2020): The last halving reduced the reward to 6.25 bitcoins per block. Occurring amid global economic uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this halving was watched closely by investors worldwide. It played a crucial role in bitcoin’s remarkable performance through 2020 and into 2021, with the cryptocurrency reaching new all-time highs of $14,849.09 within 180 days and becoming a focal point of discussions around digital currencies’ role in the future of finance. 2012 30 days before Day after 30 days after 180 days after Bitcoin Price $10.59 $12.45 $13.42 $126.25 Hash Rate 22.532T 27.053T 24.271T 106.334T 30 Day Volatility 56.80 34.85 27.18 132.9 Miner outflows to Exchanges (seven day moving average) (BTC) 63.39 17.70 5.40 40.76 2016 30 days before Day after 30 days after 180 days after Bitcoin Price $577.07 $651.30 $591.59 $1002.9 Hash Rate 1.560E 1.658E 1.478E 2.199E 30 Day Volatility 40.08 97.29 48.23 54.73 Miner outflows to Exchanges (seven day moving average) (BTC) 713.83 227.02 145.96 240.78 2020 30 days before Day after 30 days after 180 days after Bitcoin Price $6852.50 $8800.73 $9870.79 $14849 Hash Rate 116.498E 116.840E 111.554E 122.967E 30 Day Volatility 157.59 75.26 48.77 45.74 Miner outflows to Exchanges (seven day moving average) (BTC) 293.67 484.54 167.71 219.84 2024 30 days before Day after 30 days after 180 days after Bitcoin Price $67880.97 - - - Hash Rate 617.620E - - - 30 Day Volatility 66.09 - - - Miner outflows to Exchanges (seven day moving average) (BTC) 86.26 - - - Source: Glassnode as of 4/10/2024.

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. The 2024 Bitcoin Halving: What to Expect The forthcoming halving promises to be a watershed event, with the reward diminishing to 3.125 bitcoins per block. This moment is expected to profoundly impact the mining landscape, potentially reshaping profitability metrics and accelerating technological advancements in mining efficiency. Historical precedents suggest a period of adjustment as miners navigate the reduced incentives, with potential implications for the network’s hash rate and overall security. Historically, the hash rate (the total computational power dedicated to mining and processing transactions) dips after a halving as unprofitable miners disconnect, but it tends to recover within weeks. This is because the halving reinforces Bitcoin's scarcity, potentially driving up the price and increasing profits for those able to keep mining. If the price increase outpaces the reward reduction, as has been the case in the year after each prior halving, mining can remain profitable, even with fewer coins per block. This is because the survivors pick up the network's market share as others exit. Additionally, the halving incentivizes miners to invest in more efficient equipment to stay competitive. So, the hash rate tends to experience a temporary dip, followed by a rise in efficiency and overall hash rate in the long run. That is why we suggested in our 2024 predictions piece that investors underweight bitcoin miners in the six months prior to halving, as the market generally discounts the first-order effect of higher costs. Miners often issue lots of capital during this tricky period. Post-halving, some miners may be forced to shut down, leading to a potential short-term decrease in the network's hash rate – the combined computational power dedicated to mining. Bitcoin Halving Impact on the Miners and the Market That said, the impact on bitcoin miners will vary. Power costs associated with running energy-intensive mining equipment make up the largest expense for miners, typically accounting for 75-85% of a miner’s total cash operating expenses. Current power costs for the listed universe average around $0.04/kWh. At this cost, we estimate the all-in cash costs of the top 10 listed miners will be about $45k/bitcoin post-halving. Larger miners with lower per-coin costs will see their margins shrink but likely remain profitable, especially if the price of bitcoin appreciates. We believe the halving will likely lead to consolidation within the mining industry, with smaller miners being squeezed out and larger players expanding their market share. However, this trend is already in place, as publicly traded miners now control a record % of the hash rate. Historically, bitcoin mining equities have recovered strongly post-halving and outperformed the spot price in halving years. The Future of Bitcoin Post-Halving As mining rewards decrease, transaction fees may become more important for miner profitability. The halving emphasizes Bitcoin's scarcity, attracting investment and speculation. It reaffirms Bitcoin's principles as a decentralized, limited, and secure asset, shaping its role in the evolving financial landscape.

And Why Does It Matter?,"Summary Approximately every four years, a 'bitcoin halving' occurs, cutting the rate at which new bitcoin is issued in half. These scheduled events enable bitcoin to be slowly distributed into the market while maintaining its scarcity. Halving events are hard-coded into Bitcoin’s source code and are critical to bitcoin’s value proposition as a transparent cryptoasset with a finite supply. The next bitcoin halving is expected to occur around April 20, 2024. At this time, the amount of bitcoin created with each block of transactions will fall to 3.125 from 6.25 bitcoin. By Jay Jacobs What is a Bitcoin halving? Bitcoin miners are compensated for proposing blocks and extending the blockchain with newly issued bitcoin, known as block rewards. But to ensure bitcoin's scarcity and maintain its codified 21 million supply cap, new issuance is designed to slowly decline through time and eventually fall to zero. The mechanism for achieving Bitcoin's disinflationary monetary policy is known as a bitcoin halving. Approximately every four years a ""halving"" occurs and new bitcoin issuance is cut in half. The next bitcoin halving is expected to occur around April 20, 2024. After this, the amount of bitcoin created with each new block will fall to 3.125 from 6.25, and daily issuance will fall to about 450 bitcoin from about 900. This process is scheduled to continue until the last bitcoin is mined around 2140. To help understand the significance of the halving event, it's important to first understand how bitcoin mining works. What is Bitcoin mining? Bitcoin mining is the process by which networks of specialized computers race to solve a cryptographic puzzle. The first miner to solve the puzzle earns the right to form the next block of transactions and is compensated with newly issued bitcoin. The solution to the puzzle is not found strategically, but through a process of brute force guessing. Therefore, each miner's probability of success depends on their proportional share of the network's computing power, also referred to as ""hashrate"" (See Figure 1). This dynamic incentivizes bitcoin miners to invest in new hashrate. And since blocks are cryptographically linked, reversing a bitcoin transaction requires that a malicious party gain a majority share of the network's hashrate, so the security of the Bitcoin network grows in tandem with the network's hashrate. (Learn more about the evolution of bitcoin's ecosystem .) Figure 1 What are the implications of a Bitcoin halving? The bitcoin halving slows the pace of supply increases at the expense of bitcoin miners, who face a 50% reduction in block rewards (See Figure 2). After the event, the Bitcoin network's hashrate may suffer a temporary decline in response to weakening miner economics, as older, less energy-efficient mining hardware may become unprofitable and removed from operation. Measuring the impact on miner profitability isn't as simple as measuring the first-order revenue hit, however. Bitcoin's mining algorithm dynamically adjusts its difficulty about every two weeks in response to changing hashrate conditions. If the network's hashrate falls, the difficulty of the cryptographic puzzle will be reduced and the expected bitcoin production per unit of hashrate will increase, and vice versa. Figure 2 Source: Bitcoin White Paper (2008) and CoinGecko, as of Dec 31, 2023. For illustrative purposes only. There is no guarantee that the current 21 million supply cap for outstanding bitcoin will not be changed. The (Short) History Of Bitcoin Halving Events Many crypto enthusiasts perceive the halving through a bullish lens as a reduced pace of bitcoin issuance could serve as a tailwind for price appreciation in a constant demand environment. Historically, bitcoin performance has been positive leading into and in the year of and immediately following halving events (Figure 3). Indeed, the price of bitcoin reached a record high of $73,150 on March 13, 2024 after rallying 160% in the prior six months. 1 That said, each subsequent halving has had a smaller impact on bitcoin's inflation schedule. With about 94% of all bitcoin already mined, future issuance represents a small fraction of the circulating supply, potentially reducing the comparison to historical halving events. Moreover, bitcoin has been around since only 2009, so a sample size of just three prior halvings makes it difficult to place confidence in the accuracy of this narrative. One thing we can say with confidence is that bitcoin is a volatile asset subject to large, short-term price swings. The halving presents a good opportunity to remind investors to take a measured approach that not only considers the potential upside that could come from investing in bitcoin, but also its volatility characteristics and risks. Beyond risk considerations, if you're an investor in bitcoin or a bitcoin ETF, you don't have to do anything to prepare for the halving. Figure 3 Source: Bloomberg Bitcoin Spot Price as of Dec. 31, 2023. All dollar values shown, and return calculations, are in USD terms. Years outlined in blue featured a bitcoin halving event. Past bitcoin halvings were on Nov. 28, 2012, July 9, 2016, and May 11, 2020. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Glossary: Bitcoin : Can refer to both the cryptoasset and the blockchain network. The protocol, Bitcoin, processes transactions and maintains the ledger via a distributed system of computers running Bitcoin software, known as nodes. The asset, bitcoin, is the native token on the Bitcoin network and the world's leading and most widely adopted cryptoasset 2 . It is mined, stored, and transferred on a peer-to-peer network via a public ledger, the blockchain. Blockchain : A distributed digital database that is shared amongst the ""nodes"" of a network of computers that enables consensus. As a database, a blockchain stores information maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The core innovation of blockchain technology is focused on the fidelity and security of a record of data while minimizing trust amongst participants. Block rewards : New bitcoin is created with each block and sent to compensate the miner that solved the block. The block reward started at 50 bitcoin when bitcoin was created in 2009. With the next halving, expected around April 20, 2024, the rewards will decline to 3.125 from 6.25. Bitcoin halving : Bitcoin ""halving"" events occur when the block reward for mining bitcoin transactions is cut in half. These events were written into Bitcoin's mining algorithm to counteract inflation and maintain scarcity. May 2020 was the most recent halving, when the block reward for a bitcoin ""miner"" went to 6.25 bitcoin. The next halving event is anticipated for April 2024 and will reduce the block reward to 3.125 bitcoin. Halvings occur every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.

42418395,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgr7N,1713379775,"The Protocol: Bitcoin Halving Spectacular, With Runes, 'Epic Sat,' Stacks Nakamoto","It's hard not to draw parallels between the general mood across parts of the planet last week, when people were jockeying to glimpse the solar eclipse, and the excitement building this week in the Bitcoin community, as the blockchain's quadrennial halving approaches. Based on the latest estimates, the halving would arrive sometime in the next few days, possibly on the very meme-y date of April 20. That's according to the Bitcoin halving countdown clock, on the website of the hashrate marketplace NiceHash.  Conversely, it's hard not to draw a sharp contrast between this Bitcoin halving and the one that took place four years ago, in May 2020, just as the Covid lockdowns were hitting and people were stuck at home with little else to do but stay up late for the livestreamed geek-outs. (Remember when Zoom was just becoming a household word?) This time around, IRL halving celebrations are planned in places like Denver and Costa Rica.  Another aspect that feels quite different: the host of project launches and strangely lucrative on-chain competitions timed to take place right at the moment of the halving – to some degree a reflection of the ""building-on-Bitcoin"" trend sparked by last year's release of the Ordinals protocol and unveiling of Robin Linus's BitVM.

Projects like the Helium protocol, which drives a wireless network with a token-powered ecosystem, or Filecoin's data-storage platform.  The not-so-catchy term for all this is decentralized physical infrastructure networks, which usually gets shortened as DePIN.

42418381,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgqsv,1713379013,What Is Bitcoin Meant to Hedge?,"Uh oh, it’s starting again: People are again debating whether bitcoin {{BTC}} is actually a hedge.  The conversations began on Saturday, after the cryptocurrency tanked nearly 10% — from around $70,000 to below $62,000 — following Iran’s failed missile attack on Gaza. The move inspired a few columns on Monday, including insightful ones from Fortune’s Jeff John Roberts, which put it in context of gold’s 17% rally, and Blockwork’s Casey Wagner, who looked at how gas prices tend to move during crises in the Middle East.  Read more from CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Yes, it’s true that there were more buyers than sellers of oil and gold following the attack and more sellers than buyers of bitcoin — thus the former rose in value while the later dropped. But I’ve always been of the view that intraday price movements for an asset as volatile as bitcoin say very little. The bad news is: gold is continuing to rise (like it did after the collapse of Lehman Brothers), while after a little pop on Sunday, bitcoin has been sagging lower and lower this week into the low $60K range.  While the looming threat of WWIII may be putting a damper on bitcoin, it’s likely inklings emanating out from the Federal Reserve that it may hold interest rates higher for longer than anticipated because the economy is doing well that the market is responding to. Still, to raise the question of whether bitcoin is really a hedge — when in recent years it has clearly been behaving more and more like a tech stock — seems like the wrong thing to ask.  Bitcoin was largely uncorrelated with the S&P 500 before the pandemic, so clearly it can act as a countercyclical asset. The question is: What changed from then to now? Also, what exactly is bitcoin meant to hedge? Stocks? Inflation? U.S. Treasuries? Political turmoil? Is bitcoin meant to be an economic safe haven for all occasions?  There are likely a number of factors at play, including the increasing amount of bitcoin in circulation, number of holders and whales. But in some sense, the answer is clear enough, bitcoin is institutionalized. As Barron’s reported around the time of the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January:  “Bitcoin’s volatility has still steadily declined since its launch more than a decade ago. Volatility — as measured by the 100-day average of daily price swings in percentage points — hasn’t exceeded 4.5% since the introduction of bitcoin futures, which track the price of the spot token, according to Bauer. Since the 2021 launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF — a bitcoin futures fund — that metric hasn’t exceeded 3.5%. Over the past year, volatility has stayed below 2.6%.”  Now, volatility isn’t everything (and bitcoin remains quite a bit more volatile than traditional equities), but it is a defining feature of the asset — at least as it was known to be. Did people think bitcoin would remain volatile forever? Austin Campbell, assistant professor at Columbia Business School, told CoinDesk recently, “Any market growing from new to mainstream sees volatility due to small idiosyncratic events decrease as liquidity and scale increase.”  See also: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving  The release of spot bitcoin ETFs, some of which have been the fastest growing financial products this year, may accelerate this trend. As the barriers to entry drop, and bitcoin becomes more mainstream, bitcoin’s correlation with stocks could tighten. The same people and fund managers now buying bitcoin, buy the S&P — the investor psychologies are merging.  In fact, the whole theory of “hyperbitcoinization” rests on the idea that as bitcoin adoption increases, its price volatility would dissipate so it could actually be a viable means of exchange. The trouble is this idea was predicated on the idea that as a widespread, circular bitcoin economy grew, the fiat system would plummet. Said differently, bitcoin was supposed to become less volatile and more uncorrelated. That was bitcoin’s hedge.  This may stem from one of the foundational myths of bitcoin, that it is “digital gold.” It’s a flawed metaphor though; good in the sense that an association with gold signaled that BTC could have value but bad in setting up the wrong expectations at a time before anyone really knew how bitcoin would behave.  That digital gold became the go-to description is likely why we have a mishmash of ideas about bitcoin today; it’s a hedge, a store-of-value, a means of payment, a beta trade, a bet against fiat and, increasingly, a development platform. Everyone wants bitcoin to be everything all at once when in reality, over the past decade and half, it’s basically done just one thing really well: sopping up excess liquidity.  To a large degree, we have no idea how bitcoin will perform if things hit the fan. As S&P analysts wrote in a 2023 report about macroeconomic impacts on crypto: “Unprecedented levels of monetary easing by central banks across the world since 2008/09 have increased money supply to record levels,” suggesting bitcoin grew because the money supply did.  So maybe bitcoin will follow the pack for now, growing when the overall economy does, dropping when it drops. But the hedge bitcoiners are actually waiting for is more like a pop.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/17/what-is-bitcoin-meant-to-hedge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0469313dfda8d51565fcec0eeb87746d4b45ae47-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25919830,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603677,1713378631,69% Of PEPE Holders Left In Profits After 26% Plunge,"On-chain data shows the percentage of the PEPE investors currently in the green has fallen to 69% after the 26% plunge the memecoin has seen in the past week. 69% Of All PEPE Addresses Are Carrying Some Gains Right Now In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has posted an update on how the investor profitability is looking for the memecoin PEPE currently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Slow Down After 700,000 BTC Selloff, Reversal Sign? The analytics firm’s metric gauges whether a holder is in profit or not by reviewing their address’s on-chain history. Based on when the wallet acquired the coins, the indicator calculates the investor’s average cost basis using the spot price of the asset at the time of those purchases. If the current spot value of the cryptocurrency is higher than this average cost basis for any address, then that particular investor is carrying net gains currently. IntoTheBlock categorizes such addresses to be “in the money.” Similarly, investors with a cost basis higher than the latest price are considered “out of the money.” Naturally, the two values being exactly equal would suggest the holder is just breaking even on their investment or is “at the money.” Now, here is the data shared by the analytics firm that shows how this investor breakdown looks like for PEPE at the moment: The profit-loss status of the investors owning the memecoin | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As is visible above, 69% of the total addresses holding PEPE have their cost basis higher than the current spot price of the coin, while 27% are in losses. 4% of the investors are sitting on their cost basis right now. This profitability ratio isn’t that high, as, for example, 89% of Bitcoin investors are currently in profit, according to IntoTheBlock data. The reason behind the lower profits for the memecoin is that its price has seen a steep drawdown recently. Historically, the addresses in the green have been more likely to sell to harvest their gains. As such, when the market profit-loss balance is overwhelmingly towards profits, a mass selloff can occur. Naturally, this means the chances of a top being hit increase with increasing investor profits. However, a low percentage of investors being in profits can be conducive to bottoms forming, as profit-selling exhausts at these levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Next Major Demand Zone At $56,000: Brace For Impact? At present, PEPE is neither dominated by green investors nor red ones. In bull runs, however, profitability levels generally remain higher, so any cooldown can help prices rebound. Thus, the fact that investor profitability has returned to the 69% level for the memecoin could be a sign that a bottom is close if the bullish regime has to continue. PEPE Price PEPE has returned to the $0.0000050913 mark after having declined more than 26% over the last seven days. The chart below shows the memecoin’s performance over the past month.

25915792,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603688,1713373231,"Crypto Exchanges Bitcoin Supply Can Only Last For 9 Months, ByBit Report","Cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform, Bybit has released a new report highlighting the impacts of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event on the supply dynamics of Bitcoin within exchanges in the crypto space. The crypto firm has provided valuable insights on how the halving event would enhance scarcity and considerably influence the price of BTC. Exchanges Set To Face Bitcoin Supply Crunch On Tuesday, April 16, Bybit published a new report, providing a detailed analysis of the Bitcoin halving event set to take place this month. The crypto firm disclosed that the Bitcoin reserves within the world’s crypto exchanges have been depleting at a rapid pace, leaving only nine months of BTC supply left on exchanges. Related Reading: Arbitrum’s Massive $107 Million Token Unlock Threatens To Send Price Below $1 For a clearer perspective, Bybit explains that with just two million Bitcoin left in its total supply, a daily influx of $500 million into Spot Bitcoin ETFs would result in approximately 7,142 BTC leaving exchanges daily. This suggests that it would take only nine months to completely consume all of the remaining BTC reserves on exchanges. Bybit has stated that a major contributor to this supply squeeze would be the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which would reduce the cryptocurrency’s total supply by 50% by cutting Bitcoin miners’ rewards in half. The crypto exchange has also disclosed that after the halving event, the sell-side supply of BTC flowing into Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) will become grossly reduced. Additionally, Bitcoin’s “supply squeeze will ostensibly be worse.” BTC To Become “Twice As Rare As Gold” In its report, Bybit compared Bitcoin’s supply after the halving event with that of gold. The crypto exchange revealed that Bitcoin was steadily growing to become one of the safest investment choices, even for the most seasoned and sophisticated investors within the crypto space. According to the exchange, the Bitcoin halving event would significantly impact the cryptocurrency’s scarcity factor, making it an even rarer asset than gold. Basing this analysis on the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) ratio, Bybit disclosed that Bitcoin’s S2F ratio is around 56 currently, while gold’s ratio is 60. After the halving event this April, Bitcoin’s S2F ratio is projected to increase to 112. Related Reading: Arkham Releases Top 5 Crypto Rich List – You Won’t Believe How Much Is Inaccessible “Each Bitcoin halving sharpens the narrative of Bitcoin as not just a currency, but a scarce digital asset, akin to digital gold. This upcoming halving in 2024 will thrust BTC into an era of unprecedented scarcity, making it twice as rare as gold,” the Co-founder and CEO of Bybit, Ben Zhou stated. While highlighting the significance of Bitcoin’s rarity following the halving event, another report also disclosed that the price of Bitcoin would experience significant upward pressure post-halving. This suggests that BTC’S supply squeeze could potentially propel its price to new heights during this period. Furthermore, the report revealed that several crypto analysts predict that the post-halving increase in Bitcoin’s price would be less remarkable than the early pre-halving surge which saw the price of Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs of more than $73,000.

42408448,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJ65i,1713370881,Crypto PAC Spent Millions to Get Alabama Candidate on Path Toward Congress,"Shomari Figures benefited from nearly $3 million in indirect support from a single crypto-focused political action committee on his way to winning the Democratic primary in an Alabama house race.  The flood of outside advertising may have given him an advantage over a prominent Democratic opponent who raised more in direct contributions.  Shomari Figures, a Washington insider with a lengthy progressive resume, didn't pull in the most money in direct contributions as he sought one of Alabama's seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Still, the crypto-friendly candidate dominated the crowded field of fellow Democrats and then won this week's Democratic runoff with 61% of the vote.  One potential difference between Figures and his opponents may have been the $2.7 million in behind-the-scenes support from a political action committee (PAC) backed by the cryptocurrency industry, Protect Progress. He drew that spending – known in the field of campaign finance as ""independent expenditures"" that aren't an official part of a campaign – because he expressed support for crypto.  ""Shomari believes in working together to support innovation and create good paying jobs for his community and all Americans,"" Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Protect Progress and affiliated industry PACs, said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We are proud to support leaders like Shomari on both sides of the aisle.""  Figures, who occupied roles in former President Barack Obama's White House and once worked for current Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), said on his campaign website that he would ""embrace the new landscape around digital assets, like cryptocurrency, to stimulate innovation and technological advancement.""  That was enough for Protect Progress PAC – an offshoot of the main crypto industry group, Fairshake – to target him with a dominant level of industry help in Alabama's 2nd Congressional District, which has been held by Republicans but was redrawn before this race to favor Democrats. Figures' own campaign raised a little more than $400,000 in direct contributions, according to the most recent disclosures to the Federal Election Commission. That was slightly less than his chief opponent, Anthony Daniels, the minority leader in the Alabama House of Representatives, and the records show no significant PAC support for the candidates Figures faced.  The industry's spending – $2.7 million, according to the committee's organizers – marked the most the PAC has so far devoted to a Democratic congressional candidate, followed by about $1 million for Texas Democrat Julie Johnson. Super PACs generally devote their money to advertising in support of a candidacy but aren't permitted to coordinate directly with the campaign.  Protect Progress and Fairshake -- which disclose their contributors, unlike another dark-money crypto political organization, Cedar Innovation Foundation -- are backed by a long list of digital assets giants, including Ripple Labs, Coinbase and the investing duo Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. Unlike the campaign spending blitz of the last congressional elections, which had been led by tens of millions from former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, this season's giving has so far been more focused on a shorter list of crypto-supporting politicians – a mix of proven incumbents and some new candidates who are clearly friendly toward the industry.

Bitcoin Movement Determined By Key Levels The analyst’s positive perspective highlights the possibility of a large upward shift in the price trend of Bitcoin, igniting interest and speculation in the cryptocurrency space. Ali Martinez’s analysis primarily focuses on several key support and resistance levels, of which a break out from these levels will determine the future trajectory of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Are The Odds In Bitcoin Bulls Favor? These Analysts Forecast BTC’s Future According to the expert, it appears the digital asset has been gathering momentum in a parallel channel. As a result, the $61,000 mark becomes the most significant support level, while the $72,400 mark becomes the most crucial resistance level. Martinez affirms that Bitcoin might plummet toward the $56,200 and $51,600 range if it manages to surpass the aforementioned support level. However, should it break out from the $72,400 resistance zone, $79,000 and $86,000 are the next price targets to expect. Considering the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart, Martinez notes that $62,000 also proves to be an important support area for Bitcoin. If this level is lost, attention might move to the following significant demand region, which is situated around $51,500. On the other hand, the likelihood of the bull run rekindling would be largely increased should there be a rise back above $66,250. This suggests a new wave of confidence and enthusiasm from market investors and players. Martinez has also identified a notable shift in the accumulation trend score for Bitcoin lately. Specifically, the recent development marks the first time it has happened in six months, and it is now pegged at 0.27. This change suggests that BTC whales might be selling off their holdings rather than hoarding the crypto asset even more. Interest From ETF Investors To Impact Price Substantially Despite the negative performance of BTC lately, several analysts still believe the coin is headed for unprecedented heights. Crypto expert Willy Woo recently made a bold forecast, putting his price target at $650,000 at the bull market top and $91,000 at the bear market bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Issuers Push Holdings To 4.27% Of BTC Supply Amid Crash To $61,000 Willy Woo expects the coin to top out at this level when ETF investors have completely deployed their capital based on asset manager recommendations. Furthermore, Woo stated that while these figures are quite cautious, Bitcoin will surpass the gold cap after ETFs have served their purpose. “Gold went on a 12-year bull run when its ETF was approved, now it is Bitcoin’s turn,” he added. In the last day, the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated between a low of $62,000 and a high of $66,000, ultimately concluding around $63,000. Its daily trading volume has decreased by 20%, indicating a declining intreest from traders.

42408440,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJ5pB,1713369600,Bitcoin Miners Are Set for a Coiled Spring Rally,"Since around 2017, our team has been researching the infrastructure opportunities available to investors in the public markets. I am pleased to see close-to-record highs in daily revenues as we approach the fourth halving, predicted around April 19. Pleased because it reflects the business success of an industry that presently is running close to a $26.1 billion run rate (365 times daily revenues of $71.6 million). As one of the most substantial investors in the space, with almost $100 million allocated in our portfolio, the outcome of how this business is financed and valued is important to us.  Despite the optimism expressed by investors, we can understand why miners and investors are facing the halving with trepidation. We would also like to point out that 1st quarter profitable financials results expected by some of the miners seem more than discounted at current levels. Many mining stocks could be looking at forward-EV/EBITDA multiples in the very low single digits versus 2024 and 2025.  Of course, any single digit multiple assumed on valuation metrics must assume a Bitcoin price of between $70,000 to $100,000 which we would argue is reasonable given the current momentum in the price of Bitcoin. Conversely, given that these are technology companies, we would have to admit that execution risk at scale has proven a high hurdle to achieve.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  How we view the industry:  Bucket 1: Accelerators: CLSK, MARA and RIOT  A few companies like Cleanspark, Marathon Digital and RIOT Platforms have positioned themselves as large scale miners aggressively raising capital through At-The Market Offerings (ATMs). These companies are expected to show accelerating growth in revenues due from higher Bitcoin price and significant beta from exahash expansion.  As such, they have drawn a competitive advantage from an increase in trading activity, ample financial liquidity and or a war chest to capitalize on acquisition opportunities. People who are disappointed by the recent failure of the mining stocks to keep up with the price of bitcoin are missing the fact that this correlation is sustainable but frequently behaves like a coiled spring> The question is timing and the near term direction of bitcoin at $60K or $100K. All bets are off at $500K.  Bucket #2: HPC-AI Group (IREN, CORE, BTBT, HIVE, HUT)  Pragmatic oriented companies such as Core Scientific (CORZ), Iris Energy (IREN), Bit Digital (BTBT) or Hut8 (HUT) are led by managers who are executing under the pretext that traditional financial metrics matter in the context of measuring discipline. To be clear, these are definitely growth companies.  The issue is that their Bitcoin mining segment may not be their sole source of growth. HPC-AI is a compelling business model and in demand. AI computing, of course, is in high demand these days. AI compute centers are more predictable as a business than self-mining. But of course it also has less optionality than that $500,000 bitcoin price.  Bucket #3: Distressed/Value Plays  For the record, you don’t want to be in this category since this presumes a company is boxed into raising capital and in a potentially distressed situation as a small-cap publicly traded company.

42408456,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJ6Sr,1713369600,"Time to Take the Reins on Tokenization, or Risk Missing Out","The arrival of the first bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January was a turning point for the convergence of traditional and digital assets. For the first time, investors were granted exposure to bitcoin through their traditional brokerage account.  The core technology associated with bitcoin, cryptography, is not new but it has re-emerged with blockchain and smart contract technology, which supports tokenization. A token is a unit of value that can be transferred, stored, and traded on the blockchain and is a digital representation of potentially many different kinds of assets, such as ownership rights for cryptocurrencies as well as real-world assets like stock shares, real estate or even art. For some, the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs helped boost the legitimacy of this technology, and now we’re seeing more firms and retail investors exploring the many benefits of tokenization.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Nadine Chakar is a speaker at Consensus 2024, May 29-31.  With tokenization, firms could be more capital-efficient, create new business models and more easily expand product offerings and distribution channels. Firms could unlock new efficiencies and uncover ways to streamline existing processes while finding new markets and ways of unlocking liquidity – and they can likely do it cheaper and faster.  At the same time, tokenization could revolutionize the way transactions are processed. Take securities lending for example. With tokenization, collateral could be exchanged in real time, enabling firms to lower the risk of their existing processes. Managing a securities lending pool using smart contracts, or transactions that automatically execute when certain conditions are met, could also unlock efficiencies by embedding compliance within tokens, paving the way to 24/7 trading – without the need for a network of trading desks around the world.  These benefits, however, are just the tip of the iceberg. The real promise of blockchain technology lies in the assets themselves. Consider how assets operate today. Various systems are needed to run vital processes such as pricing an asset, distributing interest and dividends, and communicating with investors. With tokenization, we could incorporate these processes into the asset itself. Given a tokenized asset is capable of executing automated processes on its own, we could eliminate the need for potentially dozens of systems working behind the scenes.  If the benefits are so tangible, why haven’t we seen more widespread adoption in the financial services industry? Mainly because we are somewhat still in the infancy stage around this technology, and policymakers are still assessing the landscape and considering the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.  There are also concerns about counterparty risk, finality of settlement, and control locations, not to mention a lack of standards and taxonomy. More philosophically, digital asset owners want to ensure that their ownership rights will be preserved in the absence of a tangible asset they can hold in their hand.  At the same time, the industry’s approach to innovation continues in siloes and represents another roadblock to adoption. In 2023, nearly three out of four projects involving distributed ledger technology (DLT) had fewer than seven participants, according to a study from the International Securities Services Association (ISSA). Of course, it’s encouraging to see firms dive in and explore DLT. However, if innovation continues in silos, one of the core promises offered by tokenization will be missed: creating broad efficiencies across the industry.  The answer here is simple: let’s work together. Experiments should have a shared infrastructure. There should be many participants representing the financial industry’s wide range of stakeholders. There’s mutual benefit to be found here. Together, we can lay the foundation for successful experimentation in sandboxes with initiatives that expand upon each other incrementally and create an ecosystem that’s scalable and works for all counterparties.  Collaboration would also help ensure digital assets thrive within a well-regulated framework, with standardized governance that reduces risks and costs. In addition, collaboration could facilitate connectivity by improving optionality and the choice of platforms, ultimately improving the way digital assets interact with traditional securities and payment infrastructures.  But before all of this, firms must look inward to realize the full potential of tokenization. There’s no one size-fits-all approach, and every organization has its own, unique business model. More and more firms from across the industry are sitting down and thinking through what tokenization means for them. How can it revolutionize their business and the way it serves their clients?  In the end, the value of tokenization is directly correlated to the strength of a firm’s imagination. We are only limited by our creativity in the way we’re able to reimagine business and operating models, and the way tokenization could unlock new opportunities.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nadine Chakar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/17/time-to-take-the-reins-on-tokenization-or-risk-missing-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1509a0411910fd5f7e35545851297198b5ae61fb-5145x3430.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408454,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJ6MF,1713368830,Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs Likely Not Available for Mainland Chinese Investors: Bloomberg,"Mainland Chinese investors won't likely get the green light to buy the newly launched Hong Kong-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts reported.  This isn't a surprise given China's restrictive stance on crypto.  Hong Kong's spot bitcoin ETFs are a positive for the industry overall, but given its relatively small market may not have a huge impact. Bloomberg analysts expects roughly $1 billion inflows in the first two years.  Investors in mainland China likely won't be allowed to buy into the newly approved Hong Kong-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence reported, weakening excitement over the funds even further.  The report isn't a huge surprise given that China has one of the globe's most restrictive stances on crypto after having banned the trading and mining of tokens in the country in 2021.  Hong Kong regulators supposedly approved the launch of ETFs on Monday, opening the gates for new money being poured into bitcoin. Issuers include ChinaAMC, Harvest Global and Bosera International. The approval was announced by the issuers themselves, not the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong's securities regulator, who has maintained radio silence.  Mainland China questions  Bitcoin bulls have been looking to Hong Kong ETF approval as perhaps the next big catalyst for higher prices. Indeed, Matrixport last week suggested the funds could see as much as $25 billion in demand from Chinese investors.  Earlier this week, though, Wu Blockchain, reported that the issuers said ""southbound funds,"" i.e. money from mainland China, will not be allowed to purchase the new ETFs.  HKEX, the firm that runs Hong Kong's stock exchange, did not respond to a request for comment on the matter from CoinDesk.  The spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have seen unprecedented inflows within the first few months of existence, but while the new development in Hong Kong is certainly a positive for the industry overall, the city’s ETF market itself isn’t big enough for the launch to have a tremendous impact.  “Hong Kong ETFs are a positive but not a game-changer,” said Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan in a post on X.  As Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on X, the scale of the U.S and Hong Kong ETF markets are remarkably different, and he argued that flows are likely not going to surpass $1 billion combined given the differences in scale. While $1 billion is still a significant number, it pales against that $25 billion prediction, not to mention the $10s of billions pulled in by the U.S.-based bitcoin ETFs over the past three months.  The best use case for the Hong Kong ETFs might be for institutional investors – who can only trade crypto via ETFs – to get additional trading hours as Hong Kong trading is added to the U.S., Singapore-based QCP said in a recent note to CoinDesk.  But institutional holdings of bitcoin ETFs, however, are pretty small in the grand scheme of things, with SEC filings to this point showing that fund managers haven't made big moves into these funds. So even this use case – while legit – is unlikely to be the China-sized move everyone expected.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,"Helene Braun, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/17/hong-kong-bitcoin-etfs-likely-not-available-for-mainland-chinese-investors-bloomberg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ba24e4d9cb54970fed2b3aa45aa6799e3b49d17-5517x3679.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Order book data on key spot exchanges shows demand below $60,000, which could halt the decline.  The crucial support level for BTC to watch is $59,000, LMAX's Kruger said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has given up the entirety of its bounce from Saturday's panicky selloff, plunging to under the $60,000 level in the morning hours of the U.S. trading session Wednesday.  After earlier Wednesday recovering above $64,000, bitcoin slipped to as low as $59,900, down more than 3% over the past 24 hours and its weakest price since early March. At press time, it was trading at $60,200.  Ether {{ETH}}, the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization, tumbled below $3,000 declining 2.5% over the same period.  The weakness echoed through most crypto markets, with all CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) sectors being in the red, while the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index lost 1.8%.  The spot market order book for BTC-USDT on crypto exchange Binance, the most liquid trading pair, shows bids clustered below $60,000, outweighing sale orders. This indicates strong demand below that level that could halt further price decline at least in the short term.  Today's decline affirmed that cryptocurrencies are going through a cool-off phase after a multi-month rally that peaked last month. Bitcoin since has lost more than 15% from its latest all-time high, while some altcoins pulled back 40%-50% from their recent tops, which isn't out of ordinary of previous crypto bull market pullbacks, Glassnode data showed.  Read more: Is the Bitcoin Rally Over? Reasons to Stay Bullish on BTC Despite Correction  Bitcoin investor behavior suggests that the market weakness could continue for a while as large investors haven't started to buy the dip yet at current prices, Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in a Wednesday market update.  ""The latest blockchain data shows large holders of bitcoin holding off on increasing exposure into the current dip, which suggests we could still see some more weakness or consolidation before bitcoin is ready to turn back up,"" Kruger said.  The crucial technical level to watch for BTC is $59,000, referring to a significant support zone where prices rebounded twice through March, he added.  ""If bitcoin can hold above this level, it keeps the direct focus on that next push to a fresh record high and towards $100,000,"" Kruger said. ""If on the other hand we see more downside pressure that translates to a breakdown below $59,000, this will delay the short-term bullish outlook and open the door for a more meaningful correction into the $45,0000-50,000 area.""

25910638,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603686,1713366026,Crypto Analyst Unveils Top 10 BTCfi Altcoins Post-Halving,"As the community prepares for the much-anticipated fourth halving set for April 19, 2024, the buzz around Bitcoin-based projects is reaching a fever pitch. Crypto influencer Leshka.eth, with a following of over 128,500 on X (formerly Twitter), has identified a set of altcoins under the Bitcoin financial ecosystem (BTCfi) that could see significant gains post-halving. Crypto Analyst Shares His Top-10 BTCfi Altcoins Leshka.eth told his 128,500 followers on X (formerly Twitter) about the potential of various projects in the BTCfi landscape. He remarked, “The countdown to BTC halving ends in 2 days. If you missed 1,000x on BRC20 and Ordinals, if you missed 800x on STAMP, check out my watchlist of BTCfi altcoins poised to surge because of the halving.” Here’s a breakdown of the top altcoins Leshka.eth believes could benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin halving: 1. Hulvin (HULVIN): This project is touted as the first halving-themed memecoin with the slogan “Make Halving Great Again.” Initially mentioned by Leshka.eth when it was valued at a $9 million market cap, Hulvin has seen an impressive ascent, crossing a $30 million market cap. “I first mentioned it when it was at $9M market cap. Today it surpassed $30M MC and outperforming all other tokens on the market. Still much space for a price discovery,” Leshka.eth highlighted. The coin currently trades at $0.01298 with a daily volume of $5.8 million. 2. Map Protocol (MAP): Designed to simplify cross-blockchain transactions using light clients and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, MAP Protocol operates without relying on trusted third parties. It facilitates secure peer-to-peer connections and emphasizes compatibility across different blockchains. Currently, MAP is trading at $0.0248 with a $107 million market cap and a 24-hour trading volume of $3.2 million. Leshka.eth views it as a crucial infrastructure component for the evolving blockchain ecosystem. 3. Stacks (STX): As a layer built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, Stacks introduces functionalities such as smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized applications (dApps). It is often compared to the Lightning Network due to its extension of Bitcoin’s capabilities. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $650,000 Due To This Reason With a substantial market cap of $4.04 billion and a price of $2.29, Stacks represents a significant part of the BTCfi landscape. “Stacks transforms Bitcoin from a digital gold into a more expansive ecosystem capable of supporting a wide array of applications,” Leshka.eth noted. 4. Mintlayer (ML): This layer 2 solution enhances Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling DeFi, smart contracts, atomic swaps, NFTs, and dApps directly on the Bitcoin network. Trading at $0.38 with a market cap of $24 million and a daily volume of $2.5 million, Mintlayer stands out for its integrative approach to extending Bitcoin’s utility without the need for an entirely separate blockchain. 5. SatoshiSync (SSNC): Collaborating with LayerZero and Chainlink, SatoshiSync offers a toolkit for easing transactions on Bitcoin’s L1 and L2 layers. Even before its token launch, the platform had attracted over 50,000 users, underscoring its practical value. SSNC is priced at $0.1275, with a market cap of $124.7 million and modest daily transactions amounting to $0.45 million. 6. Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BVM): BVM is a rapidly growing Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that allows users to create their own L2 networks, thereby enhancing the value of BVM tokens. The BVM team is also planning to introduce airdrops for BVM stakers, which Leshka.eth believes could “drive up demand for the tokens significantly.” BVM is currently trading at $5.35, with a market cap of $133.6 million and a 24-hour volume of $2.74 million. Related Reading: Arkham Releases Top 5 Crypto Rich List – You Won’t Believe How Much Is Inaccessible 7. Naka Chain (NAKA): Positioned as a cost-effective, high-speed Bitcoin L2 blockchain tailored for DeFi applications that utilize Bitcoin for gas fees, Naka Chain enables developers to port decentralized apps from Ethereum to Bitcoin with minimal changes. It functions similarly to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enhancing its appeal. NAKA is trading at $0.026, with a market cap of $56.32 million and a daily volume of $128,000. 8. Elastos (ELA): Elastos aims to construct a blockchain-driven version of the internet, addressing scalability and flexibility issues found in Ethereum and other DApp platforms. With a market cap of $81 million and trading at $3.69, ELA focuses on building a robust infrastructure for a decentralized internet. 9. MVC (SPACE): This public blockchain integrates multiple technologies, including the UTXO model and Proof of Work (PoW), to deliver exceptional performance, minimal fees, and high decentralization. SPACE trades at $17.59 with a market cap of $52.3 million and a 24-hour volume of $1.31 million. 10. Photon: Touted as a superior traditional Layer 2 solution, Photon leverages the security of Bitcoin’s Layer 1 to support scalable decentralized applications, providing efficiency and flexibility comparable to Ethereum’s ecosystem. This project is one to watch, with its upcoming launch expected to attract significant attention. “Keep an eye out for its upcoming launch!,” Leshka.eth stated. 11. Additional Mention – BounceBit: BounceBit is a Bitcoin staking chain that allows users to earn yields on their dormant Bitcoin. With a focus on early access, the platform encourages active participation and utilization of Bitcoin for staking purposes. The imminent launch of BounceBit is highly anticipated by the community. At press time, Stacks (STX) was trading at $2.29, down 40% from its all-time high reached on April 1.

42408441,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJ5iZ,1713366000,"Worldcoin, Sam Altman's Crypto Project, Is Building a Layer-2 Chain","Worldcoin, the crypto startup from OpenAI founder Sam Altman, is launching a layer-2 Ethereum blockchain.  The blockchain will be based on Optimism's OP stack blockchain-building framework to offer users cheaper fees and faster speeds.  The chain is designed to prioritize verified humans over AI bots and trading algorithms. Users who authenticate themselves via Worldcoin's retina-scanning ""orb"" device will get special treatment.  OpenAI founder Sam Altman's retina-scanning crypto startup, Worldcoin, is getting its own blockchain.  World Chain, a layer-2 network on Ethereum slated for a release this summer, will grant special treatment to users who scan their eyeballs in exchange for a ""World ID"" digital passport. It will build on Worldcoin's perennial pitch as a network for ""verified humans"" – an ecosystem designed to filter out bots in the increasingly uncanny age of AI.  Until now, Worldcoin's World ID protocol has simply operated as a decentralized application – essentially just a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The move to start an independent chain could give the developers greater control over the project with more optionality while also potentially reducing costs for users.  ""Verified humans will enjoy priority blockspace over bots and some free gas,"" Tools For Humanity, the team behind Worldcoin, said in a statement. ""For developers it will be a way to reach millions of users with apps focused on real-world utility.""  World Chain will be based on the OP Stack, a blockchain-building framework that has become a popular choice among bootstrappers and was used by Coinbase to build its Base network. Like other layer-2 ""rollups,"" the chain will bundle up transactions from users and pass them down to Ethereum where they get cemented permanently. The setup will allow World Chain to offer users cheaper fees than they'd get by transacting directly on Ethereum.  ""All of these blockchains are putting a lot of work into reducing gas fees so that the network is more accessible, but what that means is you start seeing a lot more bot activity,"" said Tiago Sada, the head of product, engineering and design at Tools For Humanity, the development firm behind Worldcoin. ""That just ends up actually driving fees super high for humans, and the networks get clogged.""  ""I would say it's pretty clear that somewhere between 50 and 90% of on-chain transactions are automated,"" Sada explained. ""World Chain will be open and permissionless. Anyone, including bots, can submit transactions. But transactions submitted by verified humans will have priority block space, so they will be processed faster.""  Worldcoin's claim to fame (or notoriety, depending on one's perspective) is its ""orb"" – a bowling ball-shaped chrome sphere that contains a lens for scanning eyeballs. The orb differentiates Worldcoin from other internet services by ensuring that anyone who gets an account is a human – not a robot – and it removes the possibility of two accounts being owned by the same person.  The project's emphasis on ""proof of personhood"" ties back to the potential use cases as AI applications proliferate.  Tools For Humanity has taken its orb on the road to conduct in-person scans at conferences, events and pop-up shops. According to the project, over 10 million users across more than 167 countries have been onboarded.  The Worldcoin experience today mainly exists inside of the World App, a crypto wallet that integrates with some popular protocols and offers special functionality to orb-scanned users. The app currently plugs into the OP Chain, the layer-2 Ethereum blockchain that originated the OP Stack.  Worldcoin is the second-largest protocol on OP Chain by transaction volume, and its WLD token has the largest market cap on the chain behind ETH and the network's native OP coin.  By moving to a network entirely of Worldcoin's own making, ""it just allows us to keep onboarding users at the scale that we are at,"" said Sada. ""For existing users, it allows us to give them faster transactions and cheaper transactions.""  Wolrdcoin's initial pitch revolved around universal basic income: People who scanned their retinas in certain regions (excluding the United States and some other countries) were given an allotment of WLD tokens and a verified World ID account. Over time, as AI has begun to reshape the internet, Worldcoin's financial ambitions have been subordinated, to an extent, to its broader goals around digital identity.  With the new network, Worldcoin will bake bot-vetting directly into its DNA, making it possible for other wallet apps beyond World App to integrate World ID. World Chain also turns WLD into a first-class currency alongside ether (ETH), meaning both assets will be usable to pay network fees.  World Chain comes after a tumultuous year for Worldcoin, which faced criticism almost immediately following its 2021 debut. Some crypto adherents raised privacy concerns: The eye-ball scanning orb carries a creepy factor that Worldcoin has struggled to shake, despite insistence from Worldcoin's creators that the hardware rigorously encrypts biometric data.  There was also an unflattering exposé from the MIT Technology Review that alleged Tools for Humanity had exploited underfinanced communities over the course of its rollout – dangling the prospect of free tokens in exchange for sign-ups over the course of its testing. According to the piece, Worldcoin engaged in ""deceptive marketing practices, collected more personal data than it acknowledged, and failed to obtain meaningful informed consent.""  As AI has boomed and the crypto market has been on an upswing, the Worldcoin team has shipped a series of updates and integrations. There are new ways to use Worldcoin that don't require eye scans, and there's new encryption tech aimed at addressing some of the privacy concerns that have dogged the project since its inception.  The tweaks have helped Worldcoin grow in spite of its many naysayers, reaching more than 70 million transactions in total, according to the project's most recent data. Even Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin – who delivered a point-by-point critique of Worldcoin in one of his blog posts – praised the project for ""doing quite a good job of taking the privacy critiques seriously and designing their system to be more and more data-minimal"" in a March X post.",POSITIVE,ETH | WLD,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | OP | WLD,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/17/worldcoin-sam-altmans-crypto-project-is-building-a-layer-2-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3d66a11905593f764e725c3e8d1cfa165f0688a-1917x1078.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new self-custodial “Kraken Wallet"" is being releasing Wednesday and will be available to both Kraken users and non-users, CoinDesk is first to report. The wallet will initially support eight blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon and Dogecoin.  According to a blog post shared with CoinDesk, the Kraken Wallet will be the first from a major exchange to be open-sourced. This means that developers can access and contribute to the code. Kraken will also pay developers that find vulnerabilities through their open-source grant program, so that they can improve the wallets in the event that there are bugs.  The wallet will collect the “absolute minimum amount of data to function as a wallet,” according to Kraken, ticking off a privacy principle that is valued by many crypto users. “User activity is proxied through Kraken’s own infrastructure, shielding IP addresses and preventing users’ identity and location information from potential external exposure.”  Coinbase's Coinbase Wallet is extremely popular, and at least two other big crypto exchanges, Binance and OKX, offer wallets for users to plug into their ecosystems.     “Kraken has been telling people for more than ten years to self-custody their assets. We built Kraken Wallet on the principles central to the crypto space, such as user privacy and open source code,” said Eric Kuhn, the Product Director for Kraken Wallet to CoinDesk. “There’s a lot of interesting things that are happening on-chain and we wanted a wallet that enables people to go and access these ecosystems.”  Kraken has been building out its suite of products over the last few months.  In November, Kraken was reportedly talking with multiple layer 2 teams about building their own layer 2 blockchain – shortly after Coinbase came out with its own rollup chain, Base, in August.  The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX crypto exchange in 2022 underscored the risks of leaving crypto on centralized exchanges – possibly helping to explain why the likes of Kraken and Coinbase have been nosing into business opportunities involving on-blockchain products.  ""Kraken Wallet is how we invest in the “your keys, your crypto” ecosystem which is vital for the existence of permissionless financial access. We welcome other wallets but we are going to focus on building the best all in one crypto wallet that is open source, secure and private,"" Kuhn said.

The protocol will allow verified institutions to onboard RWAs and borrow against their RWA holdings, according to the post.  “We continue to see significant interest from our institutional clients for easier access to tokenization solutions on-chain,"" said Anthony Bassili, Coinbase's head of allocators and tokenization.  Centrifuge's plans came to light as the protocol announced it raised $15 million in venture capital investment in an ""oversubscribed"" fundraising round. ParaFi Capital and Greenfield led the investment, with multiple firms including Arrington Capital, Circle Ventures, Gnosis, The Spartan Group, and Wintermute Ventures also participating.  CFG, the protocol's native token, spiked as much as 14% after the announcement before paring gains, CoinGecko data shows. The token was still up 5% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the sector benchmark CoinDesk DeFi Index's (DCF) 1% decline in the same period.  The announcement comes as RWA tokenization race is heating up, with digital asset firms and global banks bringing traditional financial products such as bonds and credit to blockchain plumbing to increase efficiency, settlement speed and transparency. The market for tokenized asset could swell to $10 trillion by the end of the decade, asset management firm 21.co forecasted last year.  Centrifuge focuses on bringing structured credit products to blockchain rails, with $270 million active loans on the protocol, rwa.xyz data shows.

25907841,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603689,1713362432,Crypto Analyst Says Don’t Buy Altcoins Just Yet – Here’s Why,"Crypto analyst Crypto Banter has provided insights on whether or not it is the right time to buy altcoins. Specifically, the analyst had reservations about the idea that it was best to buy altcoins that showed quick recovery after a market decline like the one experienced over the weekend. Not The Best Time To Buy Altcoins In a live video on his YouTube channel, Crypto Banter warned crypto investors against “sheepishly” buying altcoins, especially crypto tokens that recovered quickly after the flush. He claimed that anyone who buys these tokens might fall into a “classic trap.” To avoid this trap, he advised that it might be best not to buy these altcoins now despite their impressive recovery so far. Related Reading: XRP Price Set For 3,000% Rally To $22, Analyst Predicts Crypto Banter made these statements based on his belief that the bearish sentiment isn’t over and that there will still be a lot of “tensions” in the market. Therefore, he noted that the best strategy to deploy in investing at this point is to use dollar cost average (DCA) in altcoins that have shown strength while being wary of the ones with bad tokenomics. He again warned against investing in altcoins that have recovered quickly, stating that this doesn’t mean those crypto tokens have “relative strength.” He further elaborated that to gauge the relative strength of a crypto token, one has to look at how much it dropped and how much it recovered after that. How To Make Your Buy List Crypto Banter also provided a guide that crypto investors could follow when compiling an altcoin buy list. He suggested that the key was to choose between the altcoins that have recovered the quickest and are showing relative strength and the ones that are relatively still cheap. He gave the example of Ondo (ONDO) as one crypto token that has shown relative strength. Although it experienced a drawdown of 47%, it has recovered and is now just about 6% down from its peak. Toncoin (TON) also falls under this category, as he showed how the crypto token dropped down over 30% recently but has already recovered and is just 9% from its peak. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $650,000 Due To This Reason On the other hand, he highlighted RUNE as a “really cheap” crypto token, as it is down about 52% from its peak. He added that RUNE also happens to be a good recovery token. Crypto Banter also mentioned Arweave (AR) as another quality and cheap token, noting that it is about 41% down from its peak, meaning that one could get a good bargain from it. Meanwhile, he added crypto tokens that have been unaffected by the dips as the third category of tokens that crypto investors could add to their buy lists.

The French company plans to launch its USD0 stablecoin in the second quarter.  USD0 is a permissionless stablecoin backed by real-world assets and will pay holders a yield.  Usual Labs, the firm behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual, has raised $7 million and received $75 million commitment in total value locked (TVL) for the launch of its stablecoin USD0, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.  The French company raised money from more than a hundred firms, including two leading co-investors, IOSG Ventures and Kraken Ventures. Other investors included GSR, Mantle, Starkware, Flowdesk, Avid3, Bing Ventures, Breed, Hypersphere, Kima Ventures, Psalion, Public Works and X Ventures.  The $75 million in TVL consists of investments from the company’s direct investors and from entities and individuals within the ecosystem.  The fundraising will allow Usual Labs to prepare for the pre-launch of its USD0 stablecoin on the Ethereum mainnet in the second quarter, the company said. This includes completion of the testnet phase, building partnerships with industry leaders, and carrying out smart contract audits to guarantee the protocol’s security and efficiency, Usual said.  USD0 is a permissionless stablecoin backed by real-world assets. Holders of the coin will be rewarded with yields generated by these assets. It is one of a number of new stablecoin launches in an increasingly competitive market. The cumulative supply of the top three stablecoins, tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) and DAI (DAI), recently increased to $141.4 billion, the highest since May 2022. These three stablecoins dominate the market with over 90% share.  “The stablecoin market is highly competitive. This competitive landscape necessitated that Usual innovate to provide a distinctly different approach from our competitors,” said Pierre Person, CEO and co-founder of Usual, in emailed comments. “Usual is dedicated to delivering a stablecoin that upholds a higher standard of safety for its users, with a firm belief that both value and governance should be in the hands of the users,” Person added.  Stablecoins are being adopted for cross-border settlements, with payments firms, fintech companies and consumer platforms among the early users, Bernstein said in a research report last week.

42408451,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJ691,1713360619,Why Bitcoin's 'Monetary Maximalists' Oppose 'JPEG Enjoyers' (and Why They're Wrong),"In the nether realms of crypto-Twitter/X, there is a brewing civil war between the “monetary maximalists” and “JPEG enjoyers.” While the Bitcoin network is limited in its storage capacity, the threshold for confirming transactions of any kind whether monetary or any arbitrary data from things like Ordinals inscriptions and meme coins is actually quite limited within each block.  The mempool can become congested relatively quickly and drive up fees for all users.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.  Taras Kulyk is the founder and CEO of SunnySide Digital, Inc.  Herein lies the conflict: is Bitcoin open to anyone for any purpose? Or did Satoshi Nakamoto have an intended purpose for his creation, which should be accounted for when deciding who can use Bitcoin and how?  It turns out there are heavy consequences and tradeoffs for both paths. As the saying goes, “Bitcoin is for enemies,” and we are finding out just how true that is. Here is why the Battle over Block Space is worth fighting, and why the question remains who will ultimately obtain the spoils of war.  The monetary maximalist perspective  To begin, the title of the white paper is “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash system,” allowing for “online payments” to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. It makes no mention of file storage. On the surface, this might feel like enough precedent to legitimate monetary transactions only (some treat it as scripture). However, Satoshi himself made an inscription on the Genesis block with the famous headline from The Times in 2009 that read “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”  The takeaway here is that invoking WWSD (What Would Satoshi Do?) or reapplying what he has done or said in the past via email is a losing battle. Putting aside some of the apparent contradictions between what Satoshi himself sometimes did and said, the core argument for Monetary Maximalism is that Ordinals inscriptions and BRC20 tokens spam the blockchain and abuse the current rule set. They could be considered a kind of DDOS attack. Or worse, a grift.  See also: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Halving  In short, why focus on meaningless, fun-for-some pet JPEGS (often with VC ties) on Bitcoin when the real aim is revolutionizing global money, value storage and peer-to-peer payments. Using Bitcoin as file storage, which is predominately done in wealthy nations, is pricing those out in developing countries that rely on bitcoin for day-to-day transactions. It might even push out new entrants that notice how high fees are, forcing them to explore cheaper options as new users typically won't understand L2s like the Lightning Network — this might be their one shot at giving bitcoin a try.  What’s more, given the block size limitations on the Bitcoin blockchain, data / file storage doesn’t scale on the protocol. The only way to scale file storage is to make the system more centralized (which is arguably why Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake) and that is obviously a fast track to obsoletion.  I fundamentally believe what’s good for miners is good for Bitcoin.  And yet, there are very real benefits in the near term for storing more data on-chain, like higher fees for miners, taking market share from other chains and encouraging expressivity and development, among other things.  Ordinals: magically growing fees, usage and fun  Inscriptions, whether you hate them or love them, have helped jumpstart a fee war, comprising 21% of all fees last year. While it’s true that inscriptions have helped ignite a competitive transaction fee environment (the peak of the inscription craze in May was $18 million), regular daily transaction fees have amounted to $13 million. Miners even saw fees double the block reward multiple times last year thanks to inscriptions. Ordinals are also responsible for the largest block and largest transaction in Bitcoin’s history. That’s no small feat, and as someone who’s deeply involved in the digital mining ecosystem, I fundamentally believe what’s good for miners is good for Bitcoin.  A healthy and lucrative fee war, whether they are monetary transactions or ordinals, is unarguably positive for miner revenues in what is proving to be a cut-throat capitalistic industry.  What’s more, the top two noncustodial bitcoin wallets (Unisat and xverse) by active users are both Ordinal/BRC20 wallets, with each growing over 30% month over month. What got us here might not be the same thing that is going to get us to where we need to go. In order to reach that level of adoption, the ideology in its current form will have to evolve. The goal is to be the predominant blockchain for everything that, at this point in time, is currently siloed on different protocols.  The gravitational force of Bitcoin, by way of engaging fun, cultural and technological movements as found in ordinals, NFTs, etc., will also benefit everyone who owns and is passionate about Bitcoin.  When it comes down to it, Bitcoin is about economic incentives only, not altruism. While it’s true the high fees will prevent others from transacting on-chain, it could be argued that this is exactly what it’s all about: free market forces.  Hate it or ignore it  The fact of the matter is, if you’re a monetary maximalist you could probably get away with ignoring ordinals and be just fine. They’re accelerating Bitcoin adoption and a healthy fee market for blockspace in the near term, and long term are likely to be priced out entirely and pushed to other layer 2 or sidechain solutions.  See also: OG Bitcoin L2 Stacks Is Getting a Major Overhaul  Naturally, Bitcoin, as the monetary network we all believe it will be, will eventually price out all uneconomic transactions regardless.  The network was built from a security model standpoint to bake in higher fees, so the argument that a spike in fees now is bad for Bitcoin later is nonsensical. My take: ignore the noise, let this trend play out, and of course — stay humble and stack sats.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Taras Kulyk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/17/why-bitcoins-monetary-maximalists-oppose-jpeg-enjoyers-and-why-theyre-wrong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0c084967bd23aa189da27b8955e452f62879e69-2048x1151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25904947,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603676,1713358849,Whale Alert: MATIC Poised For Epic Surge – Time To Dive In?,"In the ever-volatile landscape of the cryptocurrency market, recent days have seen a surge in turbulence, with Bitcoin and leading altcoins struggling to maintain stability. Among them, MATIC, the native token of Polygon, hasn’t been immune to the downward pressure, experiencing a drop of nearly 2% in the past 24 hours alone. Related Reading: Elon Musk Latest Tweet: How Much Did Dogecoin Gain From It Today? As of the latest data, MATIC is trading at $0.69, marking a 21% decrease compared to the previous week. Source: CoinMarketCap MATIC: Whales Seize The Opportunity Despite the market downturn, some seasoned investors are viewing this as an opportunity to stockpile MATIC at lower prices. Large holders, colloquially known as whales, have been particularly active during this period of volatility. Notably, there has been significant accumulation of MATIC by whales, with one notable investor scooping up nearly 2 million tokens. This trend of accumulation is further evidenced by an uptick in the number of wallets holding substantial amounts of the altcoin, ranging from 1,000 to 10 million coins. Which #altcoins did whales buy after the market dropped? We noticed a fresh wallet withdrew $17.43M #altcoins from #Binance in the past 3 hours, including: 48,922 $AVAX($1.86M) 621,003 $FET($1.45M) 5.14M $GRT($1.44M) 1.9M $MATIC($1.41M) 532,444 $OP($1.29M) 135,751 $RNDR($1.26M)… pic.twitter.com/peeRi3E3nR — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 15, 2024 Additionally, large transactions worth more than $100,000 have increased significantly, indicating a concerted effort by whales to buy the dip. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.231 trillion. Chart: TradingView Bullish Sentiment Prevails Among Whales Whales remain steadfast in their bullish outlook for MATIC. Data shows that more than half of all whale positions for the crypto on Binance are long. This suggests that large investors are confident in the token’s potential for a short-term rebound. Their optimism is rooted in their belief in the underlying fundamentals of MATIC and its role within the Polygon ecosystem. However, amidst the backdrop of price volatility, there has been a surge in negative commentary surrounding the coin. The Weighted Sentiment indicator reflects an increase in bearish sentiment, potentially influencing retail investors’ participation. Source: Santiment Negative discourse, particularly on social media platforms, can have a significant impact on market sentiment and investor behavior. Retail investors, often swayed by discussions and sentiment online, may be cautious in their approach to MATIC amidst the prevailing negativity. Related Reading: Analyst Keeps Faith In XRP, Targets $288 Despite Price Retreat Furthermore, Santiment’s data analysis corroborates the uptick in whale activity and accumulation of MATIC during the market downturn. Santiment’s insights provide additional context to the trends observed in whale behavior, offering valuable information for market participants. While the cryptocurrency market grapples with uncertainty and price fluctuations, MATIC stands out as a focal point of activity. Whales are leveraging the market downturn to accumulate MATIC, expressing confidence in its future prospects. Despite challenges posed by negative commentary, the bullish sentiment among whales underscores the resilience of MATIC within the broader crypto landscape.

42408472,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJ6ZT,1713355304,First Mover Americas: BTC Post-Halving – Remember the Macroeconomy: Goldman Sachs,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin's fourth mining-reward halving is just two days away. The quadrennial event will reduce BTC's per block emission to 3.125 BTC, cutting the pace of new supply by 50%. Previous halvings preceded massive multimonth rallies in BTC, and the crypto community is confident history will repeat itself. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, however, cautioned its clients from reading too much into the past halving cycles. ""Caution should be taken against extrapolating the past cycles and the impact of halving, given the respective prevailing macro conditions,"" Goldman's Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and Equities team said in a note to clients on April 12. The macroeconomic environment on those occasions differed from today's high inflation, high-interest rate climate.  According to broker Bernstein, the “miner fear factor” is at its peak ahead of the halving, and investors should buy outperform-rated Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK) because the market will reward these companies for their superior execution and for being market leaders by self-mining hashrate. Bernstein notes in a research report that mining stocks have continued to underperform bitcoin (BTC) year-to-date as the halving raised concerns over profitability once the rewards are slashed. The event is due around April 19-20. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain. “Historically, bitcoin price breakout has always followed the halving event and sometimes a few months after halving,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) are taking another swing at crypto-specific legislation, with a narrowly tailored bill seeking to define how stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that maintain value with some other asset or currency – will operate in the U.S. The lawmakers unveiled a new stablecoin bill Wednesday in the latest effort to create legislation directly addressing this corner of the crypto market. Under their proposed bill, payment stablecoin issuers would have reserve and operational requirements, including needing to create subsidiaries specifically to issue stablecoins. The bill would also require stablecoin issuers to deal in dollar-backed tokens.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows that while bitcoin's rally has stalled, the combined market cap of the top three stablecoins, USDT, USDC and DAI, has risen to a record $146 billion.  The continued expansion in the supply of stablecoins, a proxy for liquidity, is a positive sign for the crypto market.

The bank favors Riot Platforms and Iris Energy.  Bitcoin’s outperformance may mean that part of the typical post-halving rally has been pulled forward, the report said.  Recent weakness in mining stocks ahead of the bitcoin {{BTC}} halving offers an attractive entry point for investors, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Tuesday.  The total market cap of the 14 U.S.-listed bitcoin miners tracked by the bank fell 28%, or $5.8 billion, to $14.2 billion, from March 31 to April 15, the report said. All of the stocks underperformed bitcoin and all lost at least 20%.  The report noted that bitcoin has gained 43% year-to-date and 130% in the last six months, as it “appears a portion of the typical post-halving rally was pulled forward.”  The quadrennial reward halving slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply and is expected to occur around April 19-20.  The bank said it is especially bullish on overweight-rated Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Iris Energy (IREN) as these stocks offer attractive relative valuations.  “With the bitcoin halving on the horizon, we expect heightened volatility and trading volume in both bitcoin and mining stocks,” analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.  JPMorgan notes that mining profitability was lower in the first two weeks of April as “network hashrate growth outpaced bitcoin price appreciation.”  Read more: Buy Bitcoin Miners Ahead of the Halving, Bernstein Says",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/17/bitcoins-outperformance-means-some-of-expected-post-halving-rally-may-have-come-early-jpmorgan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58f28335b10816eedb7dfb4bd07a146a3f6b6cf9-4266x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CleanSpark has shown impressive growth and efficiency in its mining operations, with plans to expand its hashrate. CleanSpark's equity financing and low debt-to-equity ratio makes it an attractive stock, going into Bitcoin post-halving. The much-anticipated quadrennial Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) halving event is just about 2 days away (est. April 20). The primary focus for most miners at this juncture is to ensure post-halving breakeven and eventual profitability, as the impending reduction in block rewards directly impacts their sales. Acquisitions and purchase of mining equipment and sites are some of the key preparations for post-halving breakeven by miners. At this stage of the market cycle, most investors would prioritize miners with a substantial amount of liquidity for equipment purchases and other acquisitions for post-halving thriving. The liquidity position of mining companies and their operational efficiency are critical components to look at this stage of pre-halving, in my view. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) initially aimed for a hashrate of 22.4 EH/s in 2023, but had to revise it down to 16 EH/s due to delays in expansion plans. However, by the first quarter of 2024, CleanSpark is already close to doubling its end-of-year 2023 hashrate of around 10 EH/s - an impressive turnaround. The company has added about 7 exahashes since the beginning of 2024 and is on track to achieve its target operational hashrate of over 20 EH/s around the Bitcoin halving. You can have anything you want, but you can't have everything you want. - Mary Schmich In running a business tied to a volatile asset like Bitcoin, it is important for teams to be able to control as many variables as possible for efficient capital management. I believe that in this run-up to the Bitcoin halving and the ensuing Bitcoin supply reduction, qualitative factors like management proactiveness and miners’ operational efficiency hold equal weight alongside financial metrics. The crypto market is time-sensitive, and decisions made at each point in the cycle could directly translate to efficient or inefficient capital allocation and either operational gains or losses. That's why I'm big on management decision-making qualities for Bitcoin mining companies at this phase of the market cycle. Bitcoin mining difficulty (hashrateindex.com) CleanSpark's strategic expansion decisions, coupled with timely execution, have begun yielding positive results. CleanSpark currently holds an impressive position among peers in terms of realized hashrate and fleet efficiency. CleanSpark mined 806 Bitcoin in March, a 24% increase over February’s production and a ~39 increase over January’s production - this, despite the steady increase in Bitcoin's global hashrate and mining difficulty since the start of the year. Mining difficulty has increased by about 20% since the start of the year and now sits around 86 T. Difficulty is adjusted around every fourteen days based on the total hashrate, to maintain the Bitcoin block time. As the global hashrate and difficulty increase, coupled with the reduction in block reward, miners without efficient operations and high fleet efficiency may face significant challenges. Miners' hashrate realization rate (theminermag.com) In October last year, CleanSpark flipped Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) in realized hashrate and currently stands only behind Marathon Digital ( MARA ) and Core Scientific ( CORZ ). CleanSpark boasts one of the most efficient fleets among peers, with an efficiency of 24.6 joules/terahash (J/TH), and one of the highest hashrate realization rate at 98.75%. The hashrate realization rate metric quantifies the extent to which a miner effectively utilizes its installed hashrate to produce Bitcoin. CleanSpark’s planned addition of 100,000 more efficient S21 Pro miners , which operate at just 15 j/th, will potentially give CleanSpark an average fleet efficiency of ~19 J/TH, say the company maintains its current fleet in addition to the 100,000 S21 Pros. The new S21 Pro miners are slated to be added in the second half of 2024. I believe this timing will align favorably for the company, as the demand effects of the halving supply cut would have kicked in by then. CleanSpark produced 7,391 total BTC in 2023, with the Bitcoin network seeing an average of ~50 T mining difficulty in 2023. In just Q1 this year and with a significantly higher Bitcoin network difficulty, CleanSpark already mined 2,031 BTC - about 28% of the total Bitcoin mined in 2023. These numbers underscore CleanSpark’s efficient operations. Miners' Bitcoin stash (theminermag.com) Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble. - Warren Buffett CleanSpark’s Bitcoin reserve has increased by about 67% in 2024, adding over 2,000 BTC to its Bitcoin holdings since the start of the year, and boosting the company’s cash position. CleanSpark now holds over 5,000 BTC, positioning it as the miner with the fourth-largest Bitcoin stash - behind MARA, Hut 8 ( HUT ), and RIOT. A management quality I’d consider for a Bitcoin mining company is its choice of financing at each point in the market cycle. Selling off Bitcoin stash to fund expansion efforts at this point in the cycle would likely turn out to be an awful decision that could lead to missing out on significant future unrealized profits. Opting for debt financing also comes with lots of cons like high leverage and periodic interest payments which can constrain cash flow. Considering the crypto market's time-sensitive, fast-paced, speculative, and unpredictable nature, these interest payments may occur at inconvenient times for the company, disrupting short-term plans. Defaulting on loans may also force the miner to liquidate its Bitcoin stash at an unfavorable market price. Data by YCharts Though equity financing also comes with some known cons like the dilution of existing shareholders, I believe it is one of the best financing options for a Bitcoin miner at this point in the market cycle. In my view, The absence of periodic interest payments and the risk of defaulting on loans, which could result in forced liquidation of assets, makes equity financing more appealing for a Bitcoin miner. CleanSpark recently amended its initially announced $500 million at-the-market (ATM) offering with H.C. Wainwright & Co., to now issue another $800 million worth of its common stock. I believe that the substantial amount that CleanSpark aims to raise reflects the scale of expansion plans underway. Furthermore, the post-halving period presents opportunities for M&As, with miners that face challenges in keeping up with reduced block rewards and increased network difficulty likely to be targeted for acquisition by peers with enough dry powder like CleanSpark. One perk of CleanSpark’s equity financing is its low debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio. At 0.018 (D/E) ratio, CleanSpark has one of the lowest D/E ratios among the top Bitcoin miners, which translates to lower financial leverage. Risks As reiterated by a majority of analysts who cover mining stocks on Seeking Alpha, these stocks could be highly volatile as they are linked to the speculation and volatility of Bitcoin. For CLSK, there is the risk of shareholder dilution and also the risk of not adding shareholder value if Bitcoin doesn't perform as expected and fails to meet CLSK's cost of capital - the rate of return expected by investors for funding the company's operations and investments. Takeaway Data by YCharts CLSK has seen impressive momentum YTD and has only seen its momentum stall recently, following the announcement of the additional $800 million ATM offering, coupled with Bitcoin’s recent volatility. The halving event is expected to create a supply shock, with the demand created by the spot Bitcoin ETFs potentially pushing prices higher. Given these factors, including CLSK's plans for hashrate growth, its operational efficiency in mining, and the stock’s momentum YTD, CLSK is an attractive Bitcoin miner stock as we approach the imminent post-halving crypto bull market.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4684194-cleanspark-a-top-pick-miner-for-bitcoin-post-halving?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/25898965.jpeg

Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory to resume after the reward halving, Bernstein said.  The broker maintained its cycle high forecast of $150,000 by 2025.  The “miner fear factor” is at its peak ahead of the imminent halving, and investors should buy outperform-rated Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK) because the market will reward these companies for their superior execution and for being market leaders by self-mining hashrate, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Wednesday.  Bernstein notes that mining stocks have continued to underperform bitcoin {{BTC}} year-to-date as the halving raised concerns over profitability once rewards are slashed by 50%. The quadrennial event slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply and is due around April 19-20. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.  “Historically, bitcoin price breakout has always followed the halving event and sometimes a few months after halving,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  “However, in the current 2024 cycle, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals in January led to a strong price appreciation pre-halving,” the authors wrote, noting that bitcoin has dropped as much as 15% only in the last 10 days, following slower ETF inflows.  The broker said it expects bitcoin’s bullish trajectory to resume after the halving once the mining hashrates have adjusted to the lower rewards and ETF inflows resume.  The rollout of spot bitcoin ETFs by wirehouses and registered investment advisors (RIAs) “will continue to provide structural demand for bitcoin,” Bernstein said. “We continue to expect bitcoin to touch a cycle high of $150K by 2025.”  Read more: Bitcoin Miner CEOs Are Upbeat Ahead of the Halving, Expect M&A: Bernstein",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/17/buy-bitcoin-miners-ahead-of-the-halving-bernstein-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d118efe7df1f6be3c796f4d1777f7ed1344a5385-1599x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lawmaker Lisa Cameron said that employers in the digital sector have struggled to find skilled workers.  Members of the U.K. Parliament have made a unanimous call for the government to invest in building skills to match the demand for employment from crypto, blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors.  Member of Parliament Lisa Cameron, who chaired a Tuesday debate on the topic, urged the government to ensure that digital skills are taught from the early stages of education and even in the workplace.  ""Although the U.K. is well placed to harness the opportunities presented by the growth of the digital economy, considerable preparation and investment in education, training and skills will be needed to make the most of these opportunities and to ensure that the U.K. has the necessary talent pipeline to help it realize its goal of becoming a tech superpower,"" Cameron said in a press statement shared with CoinDesk.  The U.K. government has said it wants to make the country a hub for crypto. So far, it has put through legislation that recognized crypto as a regulated activity, with secondary legislation for stablecoins and other crypto activities on the way.  However, for Cameron, more still needs to be done. One of the issues that's come to the forefront when speaking to employers in the digital sector is that they ""can't find the talent that they need,"" she said.  Cameron also asked for there to be greater partnerships with blockchain companies such as Ripple, which launched a blockchain research initiative for universities in 2018; stablecoin issuer Circle, which partnered with academic institutions; and Tether, which launched an education initiative this year.  ""We know that there are digital skills gaps to address.

Despite recent dips in its value, XRP enthusiasts remain steadfast in their optimism, fueled by the unwavering confidence of cryptocurrency analyst Javon Marks. Related Reading: Elon Musk Latest Tweet: How Much Did Dogecoin Gain From It Today? Analyst’s Bold Prediction Marks, known for his bullish outlook on XRP, has boldly predicted a jaw-dropping 400x surge in the price of XRP, envisioning the digital asset reaching the remarkable territory of $288. This audacious forecast comes in the face of recent challenges for XRP, including a notable dip in value and ongoing market turbulence. With a Full Logarithmic Follow through, prices of $XRP (Ripple) may be more than poised for $200+. Prices of Ripple went on an over +108,000% run in the 2017-2018 run and has since setup and broke out of its largest resisting structure EVER!

Despite this setback, the digital asset showed resilience, bouncing back with a 5% rise on April 14. However, this recovery was short-lived as bearish sentiments regained control. Chart: TradingView At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.50, up a measly 0.7% in the last 24 hours, but sustained an 18.2% loss in the weekly timeframe, data from Coingecko shows. Source: Coingecko A psychological support, the $0.5 level tends to keep people comfortable if the price stays above it; a decline below it can alarm them. A breakdown below this level is significant because it may encourage traders to sell more because they think the price will drop even further. XRP market cap currently atis now trading at $63,454. Chart: TradingView Analyzing The Trends Marks’ analysis hinges on XRP’s historical performance, particularly its ability to break out of downward trendlines. He points to a significant breakout in July 2023 following a pivotal ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple case. Despite subsequent corrections and occasional bearish pressure, XRP has managed to remain above these trendlines, signaling a strong bullish trend that Marks believes will pave the way for a monumental price surge. Short-Term Challenges Despite the long-term optimism, XRP faces immediate challenges in the form of resistance and bearish sentiments. Trading below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and struggling to surpass the $0.50 mark, XRP must navigate through short-term obstacles before realizing its full potential.

42408452,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJ6Iw,1713344400,"U.S. Senators Lummis, Gillibrand Take on Stablecoin Legislation With New Bill","U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand introduced a new stablecoin bill on Wednesday, hoping to create definitions for who can issue dollar-pegged digital assets and how.  A stablecoin bill is the type of crypto-specific legislation most likely to become law, but progress on these efforts has stalled out in the past.  U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) are taking another swing at crypto-specific legislation, with a narrowly tailored bill seeking to define how stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that maintain value with some other asset or currency – will operate in the U.S.  The lawmakers unveiled a new stablecoin bill Wednesday in the latest effort to create legislation directly addressing this corner of the crypto market. Under their proposed bill, payment stablecoin issuers would have reserve and operational requirements, including needing to create subsidiaries specifically to issue stablecoins. The bill would also require stablecoin issuers to deal in dollar-backed tokens.  A payment stablecoin, as defined by the bill, would be any dollar-pegged digital asset ""that is, or is designed to be, used as a means of payment or settlement."" Issuers would be ""obligated"" to convert to dollars, and the asset itself won't be a security. Issuers would either have to be non-depository trust companies registered with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or a depository institution ""authorized as a national payment stablecoin issuer."" Both state and federal regulators would have roles overseeing these entities.  Stablecoin issuers would also be required to ensure their tokens are fully backed by reserve assets and disclose to the public what those assets are. They would also need to tap a non-depository trust as a custodian, and the trust will be required to use a depository institution as a sub-custodian, according to the bill.  The bill also appears to ban algorithmic stablecoins, which are typically undercollateralized tokens designed to maintain their value through algorithmic mechanisms.  In a statement, Gillibrand said a regulatory framework for stablecoins ""is absolutely critical to maintaining the U.S. dollar's dominance,"" and the proposed bill would keep the existing dual banking system intact.  ""It protects consumers by mandating one-to-one reserves, prohibiting algorithmic stablecoins, and requiring stablecoin issuers to comply with U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions rules,"" she said. ""To draft the strongest bill possible, our offices worked closely with the relevant federal and state agencies and I’m confident this legislation can earn the necessary support in the Senate and the House.""  Her counterpart, Lummis, said the bill also meets ""the growing demand for our ever-evolving financial industry"" in a statement, echoing Gillibrand's point on the dual banking system and the dollar's dominance.  The bill created a $10 billion limit for non-depository trust institutions to be able to issue payment stablecoins. Once the issuer exceeds that amount, it must be ""a depository institution that has been authorized as a national payment stablecoin issuer,"" the bill's text said. At present, the largest U.S.-based stablecoin issuer, Circle (with $33 billion in outstanding {{USDC}}), is not a depository trust institution. The next largest, Paxos, does have a limited purpose trust charter through the New York Department of Financial Services, though its market cap falls well below that $10 billion cutoff. A Senate staffer described the $10 billion limit as the approximate cutoff between a small community bank and a larger regional financial institution with systemic risk potential.  Lummis and Gillibrand have jointly introduced a number of bills addressing the digital assets market, including a bill last summer that would create legal definitions for decentralized finance and draw lines for where federal agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have jurisdiction over crypto. While these bills have not gone anywhere, a Senate staffer told reporters on Tuesday that the lawmakers had sought feedback from federal regulators and the White House.  Stablecoin legislation has long been seen as the type of crypto-specific legislation most likely to become law in the U.S., though progress has been slow. House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) have worked on stablecoin legislation for years. A bill advanced out of committee last year, but progress stopped after then-Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy was ousted.  Last week, Punchbowl News reported that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) met with McHenry and Waters to discuss potentially attaching stablecoin legislation to a bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration, seen as a must-pass piece of legislation. On Tuesday, Sen. Sherrod Brown, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, signaled stablecoin legislation could advance if it included certain specific safeguards.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/17/us-senators-lummis-gillibrand-take-on-stablecoin-legislation-with-new-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f075ae4d2cd8a59e6e2ca164a6324a6ea881e839-3647x2052.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42408445,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJ5sU,1713344400,The Solution for Stablecoin Regulation,"Recent advancements in financial innovation have laid bare shortcomings in current U.S. policy regarding stablecoins, which fails to strike the delicate balance of promoting financial innovation without sacrificing consumer protections or necessary regulation. As the global financial leader, the United States finds itself at a crossroads: we can either be the central player in managing a new generation of financial technology — promoting dollar dominance, protecting consumers and preventing illicit finance — or we can leave it to other countries to provide a framework for us. Leaving it up to other countries would be a grave mistake — the United States must have a seat at the table.  While some current proposals in Congress show promise, we have partnered to craft legislation that solves key policy challenges faced by previous proposals. Instead of drafting legislation in a vacuum, the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act of 2024 addresses the dual banking system as it exists today. It preserves states’ current authority over non-depository trust companies and ensures parity between federal and state bank charters, while acknowledging the Federal Reserve’s role as the guardian of monetary policy. The legislation creates a healthy balance of power by ensuring the Federal Reserve and states must act in concert with each other in supervising trust companies under $10 billion.  In drafting this legislation, we prioritized allowing innovation to prosper. Under this bill, stablecoins will create the ability to send a payment anywhere in the world instantly with a lower fee than the current options. Right now, financial transfer technology like wire transfers can take up to ten days, which is often too long if the money is being sent for an emergency. It will allow innovators to build new programs and apps that give consumers more control and flexibility. The possibilities for using stablecoins are numerous, and we are just starting to see how financial innovation will thrive once stablecoins become a common form of payment.  See also: Key Congressman McHenry Is Bullish U.S. Stablecoin Law Will Pass This Year  Part of our biggest challenge in crafting stablecoin legislation lies in assuaging public anxiety; far too many Americans are unfamiliar with stablecoins beyond splashy headlines of scandals. Where some of our colleagues shy away from the issue, we see these events as an opportunity to fortify our system from a repeat failure. Together, we have created robust custody practices for issuers that prevent the co-mingling of funds. We have also built in a detailed receivership regime under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for all payment stablecoin issuers to ensure customers have the ability to get their money back quickly should a problem arise, instead of having to go to a bankruptcy court.  The U.S. has the opportunity to be a catalyst for positive advancement in this space without limiting financial innovation. Banning stablecoins or taking a backseat to other countries will not discourage the widespread use of stablecoins, it will merely limit our nation’s influence over innovation and consumer protection. Together we are delivering a comprehensive solution to current shortcomings in the stablecoin space, and our bipartisan legislation gives the U.S. the best chance to maintain safety, soundness and our position as the world leader in financial innovation.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Cynthia Lummis, Kirsten Gillibrand",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/17/the-solution-for-stablecoin-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b356e507b1981aadbc02879aa616c0346cbd2c86-4030x2267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Continued gains in BTC may be contingent on strong inflows into the spot ETFs.  Bitcoin's fourth mining-reward halving is just two days away. The quadrennial event will reduce BTC's per block emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, halving the pace of new supply. Previous halvings preceded massive multimonth rallies in BTC, and the crypto community is confident that history will repeat itself.  Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, however, cautioned its clients from reading too much into the past halving cycles.  ""Historically, the previous three halvings have been accompanied by BTC price appreciation after the halving, although the time it took to reach the all-time highs differs significantly. Caution should be taken against extrapolating the past cycles and the impact of halving, given the respective prevailing macro conditions,"" Goldman's Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and Equities team said in a note to clients on April 12.  The chart shows bitcoin's performance after previous halvings on Nov. 28, 2012, July 9, 2016, and May 11, 2020.  Though bulls were in the driver's seat following each of the three halvings, the magnitude and the time taken to reach the eventual peak differed.  More importantly, the macroeconomic environment on those occasions differed from today's high inflation, high-interest rate climate. Back then, M2 money supply of major central banks – U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and People's Bank of China – grew rapidly, as CoinDesk reported last year. Interest rates were stuck at or below zero in the advanced world, which catalyzed risk-taking across the financial market, including cryptocurrencies.  Read more: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving  In other words, for history to repeat itself, macro conditions need to be supportive of risk-taking.  That's not the case today: Interest rates in the U.S., the world's largest economy, stand above 5% and markets have recently priced out hopes of cuts this year in the light of sticky inflation and a resilient economy.  The bitcoin price has rallied 50% this year, reaching record highs well ahead of the halving, thanks to inflows into the U.S.-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and has risen over 130% in six months. According to Bloomberg, the 11 spot-based ETFs, which went live three months ago, have amassed $59.2 billion in assets under management, creating a demand-supply imbalance.  As such, some analysts believe the major portion of the usual post-halving surge has been brought forward, leaving the door open for a sell-the-fact pullback after the April 20 halving.  According to Goldman, BTC's halving is a ""psychological reminder to investors of BTC's capped supply,"" and the medium-term outlook depends on the uptake of the ETFs.  ""Whether BTC halving will next week turn out to be a “buy the rumour, sell the news event” is arguably less impactful on BTC’s medium term outlook, as BTC price performance will likely continue to be driven by the said supply-demand dynamic and continued demand for BTC ETFs, which combined with the self-reflexive nature of crypto markets is the primary determinant for spot price action,"" the team wrote.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/17/goldman-cautions-against-extrapolating-previous-bitcoin-halving-cycles-for-price-predictions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5473f82ae07fc727eb40aeb70ce9183805fbe85-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25892329,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603645,1713340840,Bitcoin Displays Bullish Adam And Eve Double Bottom: What It Means,"In his latest technical analysis, Christopher Inks, a recognized figure in the field of crypto analysis, points to the possible formation of a bullish Adam and Eve double bottom pattern for Bitcoin. This formation is spotted on the BTC/USD 1-hour chart and has significant implications for the cryptocurrency’s short-term price action. The chart depicts Bitcoin’s price movement with a distinct pattern that resembles two troughs with a peak in between. The first trough, known as the “Adam,” is characterized by a sharp, V-shaped bottom, indicating a rapid price decline and equally swift rebound. This is followed by a more rounded, gradual, and wider “Eve” trough, suggesting a slower and more deliberate price recovery. Bitcoin Targets Its All-Time High In this analysis, the price level to watch is marked by a horizontal yellow line, which Inks suggests is the neckline of the pattern. A breakout and close above this neckline would confirm the pattern, signaling a potential bullish reversal. The importance of this neckline, which lies around the $67,000 price level, cannot be overstated as it represents a key resistance point that the price needs to surpass to confirm the pattern. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Halving Matters, But Not The Way You Think: Expert To derive the target of the pattern, Inks uses the depth of the formation, measuring from the neckline to the lowest point of the Adam trough. This height (8.88%) is then projected upward from the breakout point, suggesting that the pattern target would be in the area of $73,000, close to Bitcoin’s all-time high (ATH). Other technical indicators on the chart include volume, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the Stochastic RSI. Volume, denoted at the bottom of the chart, has shown a significant peak at the formation of the Adam bottom, followed by less pronounced volume during the formation of the Eve. This volume profile often accompanies the Adam and Eve pattern and can serve as a confirmation signal of the bullish sentiment. Related Reading: The $86,500 Bitcoin Question: Will The Halving Spark A Price Surge This April? The RSI, a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, is at 47, neutral territory, showing that neither bulls nor bears have gained full control yet. The Stochastic RSI, a more sensitive indicator that combines the features of stochastic oscillators and RSI, is indicating a strong upward momentum, with a reading above 95 out of 100, which could suggest potential for a short-term pullback due to overbought conditions. Finally, it’s important to note that the Stochastic RSI is showing a crossover in the overbought territory, which can sometimes precede a price correction. However, given the bullish pattern indicated by the Adam and Eve formation, the sentiment appears to lean towards an optimistic outlook. If BTC price breaks above $67,000 and closes a hour-candle above this threshold, the bulls could target the all-time high at $73,780. At press time, BTC traded at $63,571.

At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.45, down 1.8% and 21.9% in daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. With prices fluctuating and investors on edge, analysts are closely scrutinizing ADA’s movements for signs of stability or further turbulence.

The digital asset stands at a critical juncture, with its price hovering precariously near a key support zone. Should ADA breach this support level, analysts warn of a potential plunge to $0.25. However, if Cardano manages to hold this level, it could signal the formation of a double bottom, potentially paving the way for a rally towards the $1 mark. 🚨 #ADA has taken a hit and panic is setting in.

A must read, short thread 📊📈 pic.twitter.com/gYWHPHmylk — Trend Rider (@TrendRidersTR) April 15, 2024 Amidst this uncertainty, the fate of Cardano appears intricately linked to the movements of Bitcoin, the dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. Chart: TradingView Bitcoin’s Influence On ADA Trajectory As Bitcoin charts its own course, Cardano investors are keenly aware of the impact that the flagship cryptocurrency’s movements can have on ADA’s price action. Should Bitcoin embark on a bullish trajectory, it could trigger a sharp decline in altcoins like Cardano, followed by a swift rebound. Bitcoin is currently trading at $63.989. Chart: TradingView Conversely, a bearish path for Bitcoin could spell an extended period of bearish sentiment for the broader crypto market, including Cardano. Despite the uncertainty surrounding Cardano’s future, Trend Rider advises investors to remain calm and adhere to their investment strategies. ADA retreating in the last 24 hours.

42390978,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRkjL,1713333600,"Runes, Casey Rodarmor's Protocol for 'Sh*tcoins' on Bitcoin, Set to Go Live at Halving","Bitcoin's next quadrennial halving is imminent – now likely to happen Friday or early Saturday. But a large number of the 15-year-old blockchain's developers and users are turning their attention to an event that's expected to take place immediately following the halving: the launch of Casey Rodarmor's Runes protocol.  Rodarmor's big project release last year – the Ordinals protocol for creating NFT-like ""inscriptions"" on Bitcoin – brought a fresh spirit of playfulness and development vigor to the notoriously conservative blockchain's ecosystem, while showering crypto miners with a cumulative $256 million in revenue. (The popularity of the transactions caused knotty problems like network congestion and soaring user fees, among the tradeoffs.)  The Runes protocol, which will allow users to spin up scads of tokens atop Bitcoin like those commonly seen on other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, could build on the success of Ordinals. But the arrival of Rodarmor's new platform could also fundamentally stretch the boundaries of what has previously been considered acceptable in Bitcoin culture, where any digital tokens besides the native cryptocurrency bitcoin have long been viewed as taboo.  Ordinals allowed attaching pieces of data known as ""inscriptions"" to satoshis, the smallest denomination of BTC – effectively allowing for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be minted and traded on Bitcoin, an activity that was previously only available on other blockchains. Soon afterward, another developer, Domo, unveiled ""BRC-20"" – a standard for creating fungible, or tradable, tokens, another feature that hadn't previously existed on Bitcoin.  Rodarmor himself has described Runes as a more efficient method of creating new tokens atop Bitcoin, writing in a in a post on X on April 1 that the protocol was ""built for degens and memecoins.""  ""I'm creating a venue for people to create sh*tcoins,"" Rodarmor said in February on an episode of his podcast, Hell Money.  The question is whether they will take off, the way Ordinals did.  Runes' 'Simplicity and Security'  Rodarmor describes Runes as a protocol and token standard that can address some of the shortcomings of BRC-20.  With BRC-20, users can only transfer one type of token to one destination with one inscription. Runes, however, will allow users to fan out different tokens in a single transaction that transfer any number of Runes from the inputs to the outputs.  Rodarmor says Runes will offer greater simplicity and security to users than the current BRC-20 standard does.  ""To transfer a BRC-20 token takes three transactions due to the way inscriptions work. You need two transcriptions to create the inscriptions and one to transfer the resulting inscription to the recipient,"" Rodarmor told CoinDesk in an interview.  ""The other shortcoming is complexity. BRC-20 is essentially a superset of Ordinals inscriptions, whereby if you're writing a BRC-20 index, you have to include an Ordinals index and then additionally add the logic for the BRC-20 on top of that.""  Runes, by comparison, is a standalone protocol with no dependencies on Ordinals, Rodarmor said.  It is also designed to be more efficient. With the exception of creating a rune, which is done by a two-inscription process, everything else takes one transaction.  ""The transactions are very small and the transfers are very efficient,"" he added.  The first rune, technically ""rune 0"" has been named by Rodarmor as ""UNCOMMON•GOODS,"" he said.  ""It has an open mint, starting on the halving and ending on the next halving,"" Rodarmor said. ""It is indivisible, so the unit can't be divided into subunits, and each mint transaction gets one unit.""  Bitcoin Halving and Runes  There's no real technical reason that Runes needs to launch right at the halving.  It is just ""thematically cool,"" Rodarmor said.  However, he does argue there are post-halving trends that Runes will influence.  The halving – Bitcoin's fourth in its 15-year history, a core feature of Satoshi Nakamoto's original programming – will see miners' reward for adding new blocks to Bitcoin cut by 50% from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.  The security of Bitcoin is tied to the difficulty of the network, or the number of hashes needed to add a new block. Should the hash rate fall because the block reward has been slashed by 50%, among many potential reasons, the network would be less secure, since it would be easier to add new blocks.  ""The halving programming is a very aggressive schedule,"" Rodarmor said. ""I wouldn't advocate changing it, but if I was going to design Bitcoin from scratch, I probably would not have picked such a fast decay.""  As a result of the halving, the network's security may become more reliant on transaction fees – the small amounts of bitcoin paid to miners to validate a transaction by including it in the latest block.  The halving of block rewards would then need to be offset by an increase in BTC's price, incentivizing more mining activity and thereby increasing the hash rate. Should this not happen though, fees would need to increase instead.  ""We already frequently see blocks where the fee is greater than the block subsidy, and that will become more common over time with each halving,"" Rodarmor said.  Runes could therefore play a part in generating sources of demand for block space, helping to drive up fees that could become more important in securing the network.  This view is by no means universal in the Bitcoin community. Ordinals proved controversial among some developers for causing congestion on the network and bringing out a spike in fees, an accusation Runes may face as well – if it proves successful.  How does Runes work?  Runes builds on Ordinals by using UTXOs – unspent transaction outputs, a key element of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's network design – to generate transactions. UTXO is the term for the amounts of crypto left over after a transaction, similar to change remaining after completing a purchase in cash.  The new protocol extends the UTXO concept through the ability to hold a balance in any number of Runes tokens. A single Rune can contain 10 units of Rune A, 100 units of Rune B and 1,000 units of Rune C, and so on, with any UTXOs unspent by a transaction destroyed.  Users would therefore send a bunch of Runes on different inputs, which will be transferred to an OP_RETURN to be burned. That is unless they mark it with a ""Runestone,"" a pointer that specifies an alternative output, rendering them non-spendable and thus ignored by Bitcoin Core, the network's software. A Runestone could be used to create a new Rune, known as ""etching,"" or mint or transfer existing Runes.  Rodarmor sums up Runes as a ""simple OP_RETURN-based protocol,"" as presented through around 2,000 lines of code.  The concept of not creating leftover UTXOs is ""a very simple strict improvement over BRC-20,"" Bitcoin entrepreneur Dan Held wrote in a blog post earlier this month.  ""Inscriptions have doubled the size of the UTXO set in just the past year and the majority of those are forever useless,"" he wrote.

""The review of the record will presumably focus first on those issues on which [Bankman-Fried's] trial counsel specifically objected and noted, preserving their objections.""  They may also look at areas where they could argue that ""'plain error' occurred affecting 'substantial rights,'"" which would be an issue the appeals court may take up.  ""The focus here will likely be on novel substantive and procedural rulings by the court that an appellate court might see as significant,"" he said.  Another possible option would be for Bankman-Fried's appeal attorneys to argue ""ineffective assistance of counsel,"" though Auerbach said this option was ""rarely if ever made.""  Bankman-Fried's team is likely to request an oral argument as well – though really, either party could – and the Court of Appeals must hold a hearing should that happen.  ""It is unlikely that oral argument will be heard less than nine months from now, since the Court of Appeals will want to fully review the briefs and the record before the hearing,"" he said. ""Once oral argument has been held, the Court can and will take as much time as it needs to reach a thorough and carefully reasoned decision.""

Argentina has joined the list, issuing an indictment against Worldcoin after detecting allegedly abusive clauses in user contracts. Worldcoin Faces Legal Scrutiny In Buenos Aires Buenos Aires authorities have identified discrepancies between Worldcoin’s reported data handling practices and findings from provincial inspections, raising concerns about the storage and deletion of biometric data and potential infringements on user rights. The Ministry of Production, Science, and Technological Innovation of the province of Buenos Aires ordered the indictment of Worldcoin following an investigation by the Provincial Directorate for the Defense of Consumer Rights. Related Reading: Arbitrum’s Massive $107 Million Token Unlock Threatens To Send Price Below $1 The investigation revealed the inclusion of “abusive clauses” in the company’s accession contracts, which were allegedly in violation of the National Consumer Protection Law. Undersecretary Ariel Aguilar, responsible for Commercial Development and Promotion of Investments in the province, expressed concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding Worldcoin’s data processing procedures. Aguilar questioned whether biometric data was being stored or immediately deleted, the existence of databases storing personal data of Argentine users, and the complexity of the contracts and operation of the entire system. The province’s inspections uncovered multiple violations in the adhesion contracts, including the “Terms and Conditions of Use,” “Privacy Notice,” and “Data Consent Form.” Notably, the company failed to display signs indicating the minimum age requirement of 18 for accessing the service, potentially leading to the scanning of the personal data of minors. Contradictions In Worldcoin’s Handling Of Biometric Data Contradictions were also found between the company’s reported use, protection, and storage of biometric data collected from the faces and eyes of Argentine users. It appears that this private information is being stored in Brazil. Additionally, abusive clauses were identified that allowed the company to interrupt the service without providing any repair or refund. The contracts also allegedly forced users to waive collective redress claims and subjected them to foreign laws, specifically those of the Cayman Islands, with disputes to be resolved by arbitration in California, United States, violating Argentina’s Civil and Commercial Code. Worldcoin now faces potential fines of up to 1 billion pesos or $1.2 million. The company had been operating in various cities in Buenos Aires. Worldcoin collected personal biometric data, such as iris and facial scans, in these locations through its Orb technology device. In exchange, users were offered the World App financial application on their phones and received cryptocurrency from Worldcoin’s native token, WLD. Unexpected Upswing Despite facing increasing legal scrutiny in recent months, including the latest development in Argentina, the token associated with the Worldcoin protocol, WLD, has experienced an unexpected surge of 2.6% within the past 24 hours, currently trading at $4.80. However, when examining key metrics, it becomes evident that the overall market correction has impacted WLD. CoinGecko data reveals that WLD’s trading volume in the last 24 hours amounts to $319,113,250, indicating a decrease of 7.10% compared to the previous day. Additionally, WLD has witnessed a significant decline of over 58% from its all-time high of $11.74, reached on March 10.

25877508,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603604,1713319216,Bitcoin Halving Hysteria: Will History Repeat Itself Or Are We Heading For A Market Meltdown?,"Bitcoin stands at the forefront, with its upcoming halving event sparking excitement and uncertainty among investors. As the countdown to Bitcoin’s fourth halving narrows to roughly three days, market dynamics have taken a tumultuous turn, with significant implications for the digital asset’s price trajectory. Deciphering BTC’s Halving Patterns: Insights Into Pre-Event Price Behaviour While the Bitcoin market has been on a decline over the past week, A CryptoQuant analyst has recently highlighted a recurring pattern in Bitcoin’s price dynamics observed before each halving cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Beware: $3 Billion Short Liquidation Looms At This Price Mark, Warns Analyst This pattern entails a significant price decline, a trend witnessed in previous halving events. For instance, during the second halving, Bitcoin experienced a price drop of 40.36%, plummeting to $465 before eventually surging to an all-time high of $19,600. Similarly, preceding the third halving, the cryptocurrency saw a decline of 20.35%, reaching a low of $8,078 before reaching a peak of $69,000. In the current halving cycle, the price has already decreased by 16.65%, mirroring the historical trend identified by CryptoQuant. Pre #BitcoinHalving Price Fluctuations “It’s essential to recognize that before each halving cycle, there’s typically a price collapse, a pattern we’ve highlighted numerous times in the past.” – By @OnchainTarek Read more 👇https://t.co/ogwZFEecpI — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 16, 2024 Despite the decline, CryptoQuant suggests that this reduction is typical before halving events, indicating that it may not necessarily warrant concern. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: There’s no need for alarm, as this scenario repeats consistently in each cycle, albeit with varying percentages. The correct approach now is to enter the market gradually at previously identified strategic points. The path to the current cycle’s peak remains open, and we are still at the beginning of this journey. Bitcoin’s recent price action reflects the observations made in the CryptoQuant report. The crypto has witnessed a downward trend over the past week, with a decrease of over 10% in the last seven days and a further decline of 3.1% in the past 24 hours. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $63,098, indicating ongoing volatility in the market. Market Experts Weigh In: Bitcoin Insights And Projections Industry experts offer contrasting perspectives on Bitcoin’s future trajectory in light of the impending halving. Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, acknowledges the likelihood of short-term selling pressure leading up to the halving, citing the familiar adage of “buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news” trading behavior. Nonetheless, Marszalek remains optimistic about the long-term implications of the halving, emphasizing its potential to “bolster” Bitcoin’s price trajectory over an extended period. Echoing this sentiment, Samson Mow, head of Jan3 BTC adoption-focused company, dismisses the current price downturn as an “overreaction,” foreseeing a bullish resurgence post-halving. Related Reading: Lost Treasure Found?

Bitcoin, the leading digital asset, hit a low of $61,600 on Tuesday. However, industry experts suggest a potential rebound to higher highs may be on the horizon as the highly anticipated Halving event draws near. Adrian Zduńczyk, a crypto trader and technical analyst, provides valuable insights into the market dynamics, highlighting key factors such as bull market indicators, ETFs, and the imminent Halving event. Mixed Signals For BTC According to Zduńczyk’s analysis, the market exhibits bullish signs, with the 200-week and 50-week moving averages (MAs) at $33,700 and $39,900, respectively. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio is 0.55, indicating a favorable trading environment. Additionally, the 7-week correlation with the S&P 500 (SPX) remains firm at 0.71. Related Reading: Elon Musk Latest Tweet: How Much Did Dogecoin Gain From It Today? In terms of daily trends, Zduńczyk notes that Bitcoin is currently in a choppy range between $59,000 and $74,000, with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) rising at $46,600 and the 200-day Bitcoin Production Cost (BPRO) rising at $57,700. However, the analyst notes that the medium-term momentum is declining, and the 50-day Average True Range (ATR) volatility has increased to $3270. This suggests that Bitcoin’s overall price trend is losing strength or momentum in the medium-term timeframe. Bitcoin Aims For $86,500 Zduńczyk highlights the market sentiment. The Fear & Greed Index is at 65, indicating a state of greed among market participants. The analyst notes that the current phase of the market cycle is characterized by belief. Moreover, miners are still profitable at prices above $41,800, and as mining difficulty rises post-Halving, a price spike is expected. Notably, previous Halving events have triggered substantial price rallies, with Bitcoin experiencing significant gains of 90X, 30X, and 7X. Importantly, Bitcoin has never returned to Halving prices after these rallies. Related Reading: Arkham Releases Top 5 Crypto Rich List – You Won’t Believe How Much Is Inaccessible Examining seasonality trends, the monthly opening price for April stands at $71,000, suggesting a positive outlook for the month. The average gain for April is estimated at 21.95%, implying an end-of-month target of $86,500, according to Zduńczyk. Moreover, the period from April 16 to 30 has historically seen average gains of 14.69%, further reinforcing positive expectations and further price gains for BTC during the upcoming weeks. According to Zduńczyk, this timeframe could attract investors seeking to buy the dip. Despite the overall positive outlook, BTC is trading at $62,600, reflecting a consistent decline over the past month. In the last 30 days, BTC has experienced a 9% drop from its mid-March all-time high of $73,700. Moreover, in its quest for new highs and surpassing the $80,000 threshold, BTC has encountered a significant obstacle at the $70,000 level. Despite surpassing its all-time high, BTC has struggled to consolidate above this level for over a week. Nonetheless, as emphasized by Zduńczyk, the potential synergy between the success of the ETF market in the United States and the upcoming Halving event may hold the key to revitalizing BTC’s price trajectory.

25872616,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603599,1713312015,Is Bitcoin About To Skyrocket? Bitfinex Analysts Spot Familiar Patterns From December 2020,"According to analysts at Bitfinex, Bitcoin and its recent activity on exchanges reflects a pattern reminiscent of December 2020, hinting at a possible growth phase. The exchange’s latest report highlights a significant decline in the supply of Bitcoin held by long-term investors on centralized exchanges, reaching its lowest levels in 18 months. This trend, coupled with the forthcoming halving event, suggests a scenario conducive to further price appreciation, as stated by the analysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Next Major Demand Zone At $56,000: Brace For Impact? Potential Growth On The Horizon The Bitfinex Alpha report underscores the diminishing inactive supply of Bitcoin, particularly those assets stagnant for over a year. This reduction implies that long-term holders either reduce their positions or transfer their assets off exchanges. Such actions are fundamental to understanding Bitcoin’s price dynamics, especially as the halving event approaches. With an increasing number of BTC leaving centralized exchanges and a decrease in inactive supply, the market is primed for “potential growth,” according to Bitfinex analysts. They add that this mirrors the conditions observed before the significant market surge in December 2020. On a broader scale, data from CryptoQuant corroborates Bitfinex’s observations, indicating a continuous decline in Bitcoin exchange reserves since July 2021. This decline, which has seen reserves plummet from 2.8 million to approximately 1.94 million, suggests a sustained trend of Bitcoin leaving exchange wallets. Bitcoin Latest Price Action Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price performance has taken a downturn, notably beginning late last week Friday and continuing throughout the weekend. The top crypto witnessed a significant decline, plummeting from above $70,000 to as low as $62,000. Notably, this downward trend has persisted over the past 24 hours, with the asset experiencing a decrease of 4.6% during this period and over 10% in the past week, leading to its current trading price of $62,034 at the time of writing. Amidst these price movements, signs of panic have emerged within the Bitcoin market. Recent data from Whale Alert sheds light on a significant transfer involving 7,690 BTC, valued at $483 million, to Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 7,690 #BTC (483,425,557 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to Coinbase Institutionalhttps://t.co/olrmzaQdHx — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 16, 2024 While details about the origin of the address, “1Eob1,” remain undisclosed, it’s important to recognize that such transfers to exchanges often signal potential intentions to liquidate holdings.
