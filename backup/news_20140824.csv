42377563,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX723V5,1408906214,6 Cool Machines that Accept Bitcoin,"As the number of bitcoin-friendly merchants grows, so does the number of items and services users can get for bitcoin.  It can now buy you a pricey Alienware gaming laptop, some home furnishings at Overstock or lunch and a couple of drinks in a number of establishments around the world.  Here we look at unconventional and cool gadgets that accept bitcoin. They are still few and far between, but they offer a glimpse into the future and demonstrate that digital currencies can augment or even replace cash in the vending machine industry and a few other niches.  Smart vending machines have been around for a while, but only a handful of companies have decided to add bitcoin functionality to their designs. Upstate Networks pioneered the concept with its Bitcoin Vending Machine, which was showcased in early 2012.  1. Aeguana vending machine  London-based Aeguana is marketing a new vending machine that supports a wide range of payment methods including bitcoin. The machine has a spec sheet that wouldn’t look out of place in the PC of yesteryear. It measures 1000 x 400 x 250mm and weighs 38kg, which is relatively compact for a vending machine. The device sports a 15.6-inch 1366x768 advertising display, stereo sound, optional WiFi and 3G/GPRS connectivity.  So why is it so small? Aeguana insists coins belong in the past, so the machine is designed from the ground up to rely on contactless chip or swipe cards and, of course, bitcoin. Therefore, there aren't that many mechanical components inside and the final product can be a lot smaller than traditional coin-operated vending machines.  2. American Green ZaZZZ marijuana vending machine  American Green  decided to integrate bitcoin support into its ZaZZZ vending machine. What sets it apart from the rest of the field is the fact that it dispenses marijuana rather than sodas and candy.  The ZaZZZ was designed for the US states with a liberal attitude towards marijuana. It was demonstrated in Colorado in April.  3. Bitcoin Kinetics BitWasher  California-based Bitcoin Kinetics is developing a vending machine for cryptocurrency users. The company already offers a number of bitcoin machines, including the Bitcoin Kinetics BitWasher, its $1,950 washing machine.  The commercial grade washing machine is based on a Samsung washer-dryer. The brains of the operation come from Intel, in the form of an Intel Edison board.  Bitcoin Kinetics also supplies vending machines, ticket machines, parking meters, ATMs, payment kiosks, personal payment devices and arcade payment devices.  4. Bitcoin Kinetics BitSwitch  While we are on the subject of DIY, Bitcoin Kinetics offers a unique product that can transform many machines capable of accepting money into bitcoin machines.  BitSwitch  is a self-installed bitcoin hardware payments system. It is available on Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Intel Edison hardware. GSM, Ethernet, Bluetooth, NFC, RF and WiFi connectivity is available, along with touchscreens and other add-ons. The basic kit, which includes an Arduino board, relay, wires and power supply, costs $55 plus shipping.  5. Liberty Games' Pirates of the Caribbean pinball machine  Liberty Games' bitcoin pinball machine, inspired by gaming company Stern’s, is reconditioned by Liberty Games technicians with added bitcoin support. The machine is based on a Raspberry Pi board.  Liberty Games is not new to the world of bitcoin. Earlier this year the company announced a bitcoin-operated arcade machine and last year it developed a bitcoin pool table, complete with a QR code and LCD screen.  6. BitPumper automated filling station  One potential application for bitcoin involves an industry that keeps the world running. Some gas stations have started accepting bitcoin this year, but there is still no dedicated hardware for this niche.  This basically means you can fill up for bitcoin in Colorado or in Malaysia, but you have to pay for your gas at the counter elsewhere.  Although a fully automated bitcoin filling station has not been deployed yet, Bitcoin Kinetics is developing one.  BitPumper  is based on the company’s BitSwitch and it can be retrofitted to existing pumps by attaching a relay board and a controller board. When the customer makes a transaction and it is verified the hardware starts pumping the fuel. The system is not available commercially yet.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/24/6-cool-machines-that-accept-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51d1728c00bf8b8624d3923fd6f063b8292c0ad6-1300x597.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377566,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX723Xb,1408893016,"Crypto 2.0 Roundup: Counterparty Debuts Multisig, Ethereum's Crowdsale and Comedians Go Crypto","Amidst bitcoin’s disruption of the online payments industry, heated debates over pending regulations and the slow and steady expansion of bitcoin ATM locations, it can be easy to lose sight of the widespread impact bitcoin, and more importantly, the technology behind it, is making beyond digital money.  In yesterday's roundup, we gave a broad-scale overview of Crypto 2.0 with insight from the emerging sector's major players. Today, we'll look at the recent news in the space to illustrate how this sector of industry is seeking to move bitcoin forward.  Counterparty launches multisig functionality  Peer-to-peer decentralized exchange Counterparty has introduced support for multi-signature (multisig) addresses, including 1-of-2, 2-of-2, 1-of-3, 2-of-3 and 3-of-3 multisig addresses.  Beyond adding extra security to accounts and transactions, multisig allows any Counterparty transaction to be tied to multiple signers.  Counterparty co-founder Robby Dermody explained:  “In the real world, quite often, you don’t have one-party ownership. There are often intermediaries. This is where, up to this point with block chain technology, there’s been some isolation from real world interactions.""  With the new feature, Counterparty users can include escrow agents, auditors or other third-party certifiers in transactions. Dermody provides a simple example of this implementation where a gold asset representing the physical ownership of a gold bar is traded between two parties on Counterparty.  With multisig, a third party could serve as an escrow that will release, the gold asset to the buyer only when its confirmed the buyer has received the physical gold. Dermody added:  “It takes us one step closer to the holy grail of smart property. I think people in the space oftentimes think we don’t need these archaic tie-overs. But even if you did have smart property, unless there is some sort of built-in intelligence, you are still going to need the intermediary frame, and multisig makes that possible.""  Multisig is currently available on Counterpartyd (Counterparty’s command-line input interface) and on Counterparty’s Testnet. Dermody expects multisig will be available in Counterparty’s GUI interface Counterwallet in one or two months.  Storj completes first round of crowdsale  Storj  , a decentralized data storage platform built on top of the bitcoin block chain, concluded the first round of a three-phase crowdsale on Tuesday, raising 910 BTC in exchange for 35m Storjcoin X.  Following the announcement, CoinDesk spoke to Shawn Wilkinson, Storj’s founder, who illustrated how the money will be used, saying:  “Mostly we’ve been focused on coding and now we are beginning to focus on documentation. Our primary concern at the moment is explaining to people how we are doing things. The crowdsale allows us to do that more easily now, and also hire more people to work on the specific [Storj] applications.""  Those specific applications of the Storj platform are Metadisk, which allows people to buy computer storage space from a decentralized network, and DriveShare, which allows people to sell their free hardware space to the network.  There is a prototype for Metadisk running now, which allows uploads of images, audio, and video to the network. Wilkinson says the team is currently working on getting payments integrated into the Metadisk platform.  Wilkinson went on to say that there has been a lot of demand for them to release DriveShare. The company is planning a staggered release for DriveShare once it is ready for beta testing.  He concluded:  “Our idea is that you should build your network one step at a time instead of releasing the whole thing at once and seeing where it goes. Our process is gradual. Push something out, fix it, release it again. Push something out, fix it, release it again.""  BTER hacker returns stolen NXT  The hacker who stole 50m NXT from the China-based BTER exchange has returned approximately 85% of the stolen digital currency, according to the NXT blockchain.  CoinDesk previously reported on 15th August that approximately $1.65m (at press time) worth of NXT had been stolen from BTER by a hacker, now revealed to operate under the handle “thesircom”.  BTER did not respond to requests from CoinDesk to determine the price it paid for the returned coins.  According to earlier reports, BTER initially agreed to pay thesircom’s ransom request, but thesircom became frustrated with how long BTER took and stopped responding to communication. Meanwhile, the NXT core developers gave the community the option to expunge the bad transaction.  If 51% or more of the people running the NXT client decide to run the update released by the core developers, the bad transaction would be expunged from the NXT block chain. This did not happen, and BTER was forced to pay the hacker.  NXT is a second-generation cryptocurrency built to handle large amounts of data that launched its Asset Exchange in May. Sergey Nazarov, the creator of the Secure Asset Exchange, which allows anyone to securely trade assets on NXT’s Asset Exchange, explained to CoinDesk that NXT is not intended to replace bitcoin, but exist alongside it.  ""NXT is really a complement to bitcoin,” Nazarov tells CoinDesk. “Allowing us to easily put valuable data like asset ownership into a block chain is what will lead to that data being transacted around in bitcoin.""  MyPowers announces comedian coin  CoinPowers announced its new name MyPowers in addition to introducing a new artist coin for comedian Aries Spears at last weekend’s Cryptolina Bitcoin Expo in Raleigh, North Carolina.  MyPowers is a marketplace for premium access rights. It allows artists, organizations and brands to create digital coins, which fans in turn can purchase for access to an in-depth brand experience.  For example, a musician could issue a coin that gives owners early access to new songs, backstage clearance at concerts and the ability to vote on things like what dress he or she should wear to an upcoming awards show.  “MyPowers wants to take brand equity and turn it into an asset,” says co-founder Aaron Gatti.  Unlike a traditional fan club, Gatti explains, this new kind of premium access is tradable. Coins can be bought and sold like any other digital token, meaning as a brand or artist becomes more popular and premium access to that brand becomes more desirable, a coin’s value could increase too.  MyPowers’ first coin, musician Tatiana Moroz’s TatianaCoin, launched Counterparty through a 30-day crowdsale in May. Aries Spears Coin will be MyPowers’ second release. It will be followed by a brand coin for Canadian clothing maker Potential Apparel, a coin for the 2014 BitFilm Festival and more.  Ether crowdsale nears completion  Ethereum  has raised more than 27,600 BTC since its pre-sale of its own digital currency ether began on 23rd July. At current bitcoin prices, that is equivalent to $13.2m.  “This puts the total value of ether, including the two endowments, at slightly less than BitShares X, making us already sixth place among all coins,” Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, told CoinDesk, referencing CoinMarketCap.com for current digital currency markets.  Buterin also points out that ether is the first coin selling with its exodus being a multisig address, which has driven up the number of coins in multisig by 80% since ether went on sale.  Ether will be used in Ethereum’s upcoming distributed application software platform, which will allow developers to build distributed programs on top of Ethereum’s own block chain. On its website, Ethereum states its block chain’s Genesis Block will be released in winter 2014/2015.  The crowd sale ends on 2nd September.

42377561,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX723SZ,1408874719,Stability and Taxes: Could Bitcoin Be a Replacement for Gold?,"Given that the design of bitcoin's peer-to-peer system was partly inspired by gold, it's not a surprise that many bitcoin enthusiasts are also fans of the precious metal.  Both gold and bitcoin are scarce commodities used as stores of value by those who might be distrustful of fiat currencies.  The bitcoin community has long been interested in courting gold users – Ripple, for example, recently introduced gold trading to its platform. Even so, gold enthusiasts have not always been bitcoin champions. Some even go so far as to vocally oppose bitcoin as an investment vehicle.  Schiff's stance  One notable gold enthusiast and bitcoin skeptic is Peter Schiff, whose precious metals company Euro Pacific Precious Metals accepts bitcoin payments for gold. Schiff has continued to speak out about what he feels is the lack of long-term potential for bitcoin.  He told CoinDesk in May:  “I still don’t feel that any of these digital currencies are likely to survive long term.""  Schiff isn't alone in his belief, and he doesn't think his anti-bitcoin stance hurts his company's chances finding customers in the market for converting BTC into gold market.  Euro Pacific's main selling point, according to Schiff, is that bitcoin investors can unload some of the digital currency for gold in case of a precipitous price drop.  The radio host added:  “What if it goes down to $100 or lower? Maybe it will. People can take some risk off the table by buying some gold or silver.”  It remains to be seen whether Schiff will be right or wrong in the end. That's why it is important to compare bitcoin and gold in terms of price stability and taxation in an attempt to showcase how bitcoin could surpass gold as a popular investment.  Stability issues  It's important to establish why bitcoin users believe the digital currency could take the place of gold in the global market.  One of the main reasons is because some see bitcoin as an investment without the common pain points associated with gold. In addition, significant investment capital pouring into the bitcoin market could make it more valuable than gold.  The high-water mark for those who share this value belief took place on 29th November, when the price of bitcoin on then-operational Mt Gox exchange reached a high of $1,242, trading two cents above gold’s $1,241.98 at the time.  That price similarity was short lived, however. Soon after the start of 2014, bitcoin's price fell due to uncertainty in the Chinese market – along with the collapse of Mt Gox.  Despite a brief correlation in price, high volatility is the reason some still think that most gold bugs don’t believe in bitcoin as an investment.  Gold prices fluctuate too, but not as much as bitcoin has this year. BTC has seen an over 62% drop in 2014 after hitting a high of $951.39 in early January down to $360.84 in April.  Despite fears of instability, Timothy Coles, a gold investor who is selling his Canadian gold mine that generates $1m annually for BTC, told CoinDesk he thinks the decentralized currency is less susceptible to the whims of banking forces.  Coles said:  ""People that have gold really have no control over the direction that [it] goes.”  Gold, bitcoin and taxes  Convincing gold enthusiasts that bitcoin could prevail long term requires rethinking of long-held beliefs. Many investors in scarce metals, for example, believe no matter what may happen in terms of the economic realities, the scarcity of gold will continue to hold its value.  Michael Deblis, a tax attorney who specializes in gold investments, noted that investors to turn to gold given its history of security. He said:  “Many taxpayers store gold in private accounts offshore in many different countries. There is proliferation [of that] in recent years because of uncertain global economy.”  Bitcoin also has an advantage in that its US tax status is currently more favorable than holding gold in offshore accounts.  In 2013, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) established a new form that taxpayers with financial accounts outside of the US must submit to the IRS. It’s called a report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBAR – with rules that require reporting gold holdings.  This, along with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FACTA, overseas reporting requirements are one likely influencer for foreign-residing Americans to increasingly give up passports – and US citizenship.  This makes bitcoin advantageous, at least for the time being. Deblis said a recent conference call held by the IRS confirmed there were no reporting requirements for bitcoin on 2013's FBAR.  However, the agency is reexamining virtual currencies, meaning there could be some changes to that in the future.  In the end  Anyone who has been watching the bitcoin markets since the demise of Mt. Gox has probably seen more stability than perhaps ever before.  Yet relatively shallow bitcoin order books on various exchanges could still pose a problem if large buyers or sellers want to make waves in the market.  Many large bitcoin investors, however, use more institutional-grade vehicles for the bitcoin, including companies like Vaurum and SecondMarket. There are also new tools coming out to help hedge against volatility – Coinapault's Locks is an example of this – and there will likely be more complex instruments available to investors in the future.  The tax issue for bitcoin is still evolving. The IRS has ruled it property for now, which has been applauded by investors and other experts in digital payments. The ruling as it stands can be interpreted as bitcoin being digital gold, and gold analog bitcoin.  Based on tax attorney Deblis' understanding, it's still an iterative process for the IRS. But he believes that the IRS property designation for BTC should stand. He added:  ""I think a very compelling argument can be made that [bitcoin] is so distinct from any type of a typical banking situation that it is property and should not be treated analogous to money that is deposited in financial institutions.""
