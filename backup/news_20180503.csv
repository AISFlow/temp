42401483,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqkF,1525383915,'Belligerent' Crypto Miners Prompt Power Utility to Beef Up Security,"A public utility in one of the U.S. hot spots for bitcoin mining is adopting new security measures in light of harassment suffered by some of its employees.  The steps are being taken by the Chelan County Public Utility District (PUD) in Washington County – as previously reported, the area has attracted a number of bitcoin miners because of its abundant access to hydropower sources. Yet ""confrontations"" between staffers and would-be mine operators, as first reported by The Wenatchee World, have sparked a drive to add new cameras, install security panels and institute other actions.  On Monday, Chelan County PUD director of corporate security Rich Hyatt briefed the district's commissioners during a meeting, attributing the moves to ""belligerent behavior by impatient cryptocurrency miners"" who are reacting poorly following a moratorium imposed on new bitcoin mines.  Hyatt explained:  ""Some of the things we're doing internally, we've got a lot of business security measures, at [headquarters] we've [installed] a lot of security panels, we've increased the camera coverage. We've also designed and are going into the construction phase for a very small store front lobby that would give employees a lot more security without having personnel or customers being able to walk right into their work area. We're monitoring those areas.""  He also described new measures being taken to dissuade unauthorized bitcoin miners from setting up facilities, saying his office was making agreements with the chief of police, the county sheriff and the county prosecutor to investigate and potentially prosecute repeat offenders.  ""We ... have an agreement with those agencies that we could use [them] as the mechanism that when we prepare a case and gather the evidence and establish probable cause, we can take that case through their detectives and that can help the county for prosecution considerations,"" he said.  The agency has also trained its personnel on how to deal with potentially hostile people by installing panic buttons for front-line staff and adding security officers able to spot ""negative body language,"" he said.

42401464,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqWT,1525380311,JPMorgan Seeks Patent for Blockchain-Powered Interbank Payments,"JPMorgan Chase is seeking to patent a system for using distributed ledgers as a way to facilitate and reconcile financial transactions, newly-released filings show.  In a patent application published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday (which was originally submitted last October), JPMorgan outlined a system that uses distributed ledgers to record payments being sent from one bank to another using a peer-to-peer network. According to the bank, the tech's use would provide ""a unique system for recording transactions and storing data.""  The ability to replicate that data on the ledge across a public or private distribution network offers another benefit, the filing notes.  JPMorgan goes on to explain:  ""In one embodiment, a method for processing network payments using a distributed ledger may include: (1) a payment originator initiating a payment instruction to a payment beneficiary; (2) a payment originator bank posting and committing the payment instruction to a distributed ledger on a peer-to-peer network; (3) the payment beneficiary bank posting and committing the payment instruction to the distributed ledger on a peer-to-peer network; and (4) the payment originator bank validating and processing the payment through a payment originator bank internal system and debiting an originator account.""  A blockchain could improve upon existing systems by allowing real-time settlement more cheaply and quickly than is possible at present, according to the bank.  ""For a cross-border payment to be made from a payment organization to a payment beneficiary, a number of messages must be sent between the banks and clearing houses involved in processing the transaction. This often results in a slow transaction, as there are may be delays in service due to correspondent banking, messaging networks, and clearing intermediaries in the payment flow,"" the application explains.  It's perhaps unsurprising that JPMorgan would seek a patent for its blockchain-related work in the area of interbank payments. The bank launched a platform for just that kind of service, built on ethereum-offshoot Quorum, days before it filed the patent application.  ""Blockchain capabilities have allowed us to rethink how critical information can be sourced and exchanged between global banks,"" Emma Loftus, head of global payments and foreign exchange for JPMorgan Treasury Services, said at the time.

Public records show that the Arizona House of Representatives passed Senate Bill 1091 on April 30 by a 43-14 vote. That comfortable passage aside, the measure is now starkly different from the one originally submitted – and later passed – in the Arizona Senate.  Now, the two chambers enter talks to reconcile the differences, with lawmakers from the House and the Senate being named to undertake the task.  By far the biggest change is that the mandate aimed at Arizona's Department of Revenue – which would have cleared the way for it to accept cryptocurrency as payment for tax liabilities – has been walked back.  If implemented as-is, the House version would merely require the Department to study the issue and that it ""may develop, adopt and use a payment system that enables the immediate remittance and collection of tax in real time at the point of sale, including payments of additional amounts after audit.""  As the bill explains further:  ""The Department shall study whether a taxpayer may pay the taxpayer's income tax liability by using a payment gateway, such as bitcoin, litecoin or any other cryptocurrency that uses electronic peer-to-peer systems. The Department shall study the conversion of cryptocurrency payments to United States dollars at the prevailing rate after receipt and shall study the process of crediting the taxpayer's account with the converted dollar amount actually received less any fees or costs incurred by the Department for conversion.""  The bill does not define when this study would begin or how long it might take for the results to be compiled into a report. It is further unclear whether Arizona would allow its tax officials to collect payments using cryptocurrencies at a later date.

Addressing the FIA Law and Compliance conference in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, commissioner Brian Quintenz spoke out about ""an effort that is underway at both the SEC and CFTC to coordinate and harmonize regulatory oversight.""  Quintenz did not focus on cryptocurrencies specifically, but when he did talk about them, the emphasis was on ""fraud, market manipulation and disruptive trading involving virtual currency.""  He reminded the audience that the CFTC has set up a special task force ""to prosecute fraud in this evolving asset class,"" and stressed the importance of cooperating with the SEC so as to ""ensure that differences in product nomenclature do not enable bad actors to slip through jurisdictional cracks.""  Examples of recent cooperation between the SEC and CFTC include the cases against the alleged My Big Coin and CabbageTech cryptocurrency scams, according to an annotated transcript of Quintenz's remarks.  Commissioner Rostin Behnam, who spoke Thursday morning, struck a much softer tone on cryptocurrencies. He noted that CME Group and Cboe's introduction of bitcoin futures required a ""hard and fast introduction"" to bitcoin and blockchain technology.  He expressed concern that cryptocurrencies could present a threat to financial stability, if not now then down the line. He urged regulators – who often find themselves ""scurrying to keep pace with swift innovations"" – to act before that threat appears.  Behnam acknowledged that not everything in the cryptocurrency markets is a fraud and said that policy should ""reflect an understanding of FinTech and address the concerns and needs of all stakeholders.""  The commissioner was skeptical of the cryptocurrency industry's attempt to craft its own regulations, since ""their motives may be too focused on supporting industry growth."" Even so, he welcomed market participants to help craft policy:  ""Let's work together, have an honest conversation, and seek solutions that focus on an inclusive regulatory landscape.""

42401463,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqVU,1525367409,Bitmain's Latest Crypto ASIC Can Mine Zcash,"Bitmain has unveiled a new cryptocurrency mining hardware product dedicated to the Equihash algorithm, which is used by the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash.  The Equihash application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was announced Thursday, with shipments expected to begin in June, according to Bitmain's website. The Antminer Z9 mini's release comes exactly a month after the formal debut of Bitmain's ethereum-focused ASIC.  Bitmain tweeted its announcement shortly after 6:30 a.m. EDT:    ""Pleased to announce the Antminer Z9 mini, an ASIC miner to mine #Equihash-based cryptocurrencies. To prevent hoarding and to let more individuals worldwide get one, we've set a limit of one miner per user. Order here (https://goo.gl/fqzDLV ) now while stock lasts!      #AntminerZ9.""    ASICs have been introduced for other hash algorithms in the past, leading to sea-changes in the mining industries of bitcoin, litecoin and, most recently, ether. When ASICs become available for a cryptocurrency, GPUs (graphical processing units) or especially CPUs (central processing units) become less attractive options for would-be miners.  This fact has made ASICs controversial since their introduction tends to centralize mining into a few large operations. Opponents of ASIC mining argue that this trend is antithetical to the decentralized intent of cryptocurrencies, and some projects' developers have promised to change their networks' underlying functions to thwart manufacturers like Bitmain.  Zooko Wilcox, zcash's founder, commented on the prospect of ASIC miners being developed for zcash Wednesday.  ""I'm really chagrined that I let it sound like we were committing to a social contract of ongoing ASIC-resistance,"" he wrote, adding:  ""That is absolutely never what I had intended to commit to, because (a) I always thought that it would probably become impossible long-term, and (b) I always believed that there was a fundamental trade-off between widespread distribution of the coins on one hand, and miners having a large sunk-cost investment into the coin on the other hand, and that the latter might eventually prove to be valuable for attack-resistance and network stability.""

In a 10-Q filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Square declared its financial results for Q1 2018, noting that roughly 5 percent of its revenue came from customers purchasing bitcoin through its Cash app. Due to the costs of purchasing the cryptocurrency, the company's total profit in the time period is about $223,000.  According to the filing:  ""For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the revenue recognized from contracts with customers was $648.8 million, including $34.1 million from bitcoin sales. Revenue from other sources was $19.8 million. Impairment losses arising from contracts with customers were not significant in the current reporting period.""

May 2-3 ether price chart. Source: CoinDesk.  The cryptocurrency is well below its all-time highs of over $1,200, which it reached in January. The prices fell steeply during the following months, in line with a broad decline across nearly all crypto-assets. It bottomed out in early April, however, and has nearly doubled from its level of $380 on April 5.  Ether's rise has defied growing regulatory concerns, as authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere crack down on initial coin offerings (ICOs), many of which have been launched on the ethereum network. Despite increased scrutiny, however, ICOs have continued, with the value raised in the first quarter surpassing the total for all of 2017.  More recently, questions have arisen about the legal status of ether itself. Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Gary Gensler commented in late April that ether might qualify as a security, meaning it could be subject to stricter regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Joseph Lubin, a co-founder of ethereum, responded Tuesday by reiterating his view that ether does not fit the definition of a security.

42401475,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqfK,1525359330,Daily Volatility Decline? Bitcoin Has Seen $1K Range 43 Times In 2018,"Bitcoin is famous (or infamous) for its daily price jumps and falls, but lately the charts seem to be bordering on the comatose. So, has the cryptocurrency's volatility really dropped or are we in business as usual?  We crunched the numbers to find out, and while things have been calm of late, it certainly hasn't been a quiet 2018 for the world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency. In fact, bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed daily volatility (or an inter-day trading range) above $1,000 as many as 43 times so far this year (using price data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index).  That would seem a lot perhaps, but it's not so simple. When we break down the data over time another pattern reveals itself.  The number of days in 2018 when the trading range was above $1,000 was highest in January, passing that level 21 times. Notably, that month saw the crypto markets rocked by regulatory talk in South Korea and China that caused jitters among traders and investors.  Moving on, the number of days the trading range was above $1,000 in February dropped by nearly half to 13.  Since then volatility has indeed plummeted, dropping to seven days in March and just two days in April.  So, what's going on?  It's worth noting that bitcoin's price starting falling sharply from near record highs at the start of January amid the market angst over the Asian news.  Since volatility tends to spike during bear markets and drop during bullish price action, this pattern is something that could have been expected.  So, as the bearish atmosphere prevailed early in the year, the frequency of trading ranges above $1,000 was at its highest, while the subsequent bullish shift in the market has had the opposite effect.  For example, BTC rallied from $6,443 to $9,536 over the last 32 days. Meanwhile, during the same time period, the average daily volatility dropped to $454.  Further, the daily volatility stood at $278 yesterday – down almost 70 percent from the average daily volatility of $922 seen this year and below the 2017 average of $348 (predominantly a bull market).  What happens next?  An extended period of low volatility is often followed by a sharp rise in volatility (big move). The mean reversion theory also states that readings (volumes, price, returns) eventually move back toward the means (averages).  So, it looks safe to say the business is about to pick up.  Right now, the technical set up on the charts is bullish, so the big move, when it happens, will likely happen on the higher side. But, as always, there are no guarantees...

42401467,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqZQ,1525354240,New Ideas Energize Ethereum Though True Signaling Solution Still Elusive,"Put enough heads together and you might just solve governance.  At least, that was the idea behind a private, two-day meeting of top researchers, who met in Toronto this week to discuss how decisions should be made on ethereum, the world's second most valuable blockchain network.  Named ""EIP:0,"" a nod to the platform’s process for accepting codes changes – the meeting consisted of members from a variety of startups and non-profits working to advance the technology, with notable members including Parity Technologies, the Web3 Foundation, the Ethereum Foundation, Giveth, Aragon, Consensys, MetaMask and others.  Designed to give participants a protected space to discuss one of the platform’s hardest problems, much of the focus was around a handful of issues that have caused controversy over the past few months. Whether it was the debate over how to return frozen funds, whether to limit ether issuance or to reject mining hardware advances, developers have struggled with how best to measure and enact the will of the diverse and polarized community.  But for such a theoretical unknown, the meeting proved highly productive, participants said.  ""One thing that immediately became apparent through the workshop was the question of community,” core developer Lane Rettig told CoinDesk. “I think it is the single biggest takeaway from this event.”  According to Rettig, much of the discussion surrounded how to better identify what constitutes a community member, or someone who should have a say in just how ethereum develops, and how to accurately measure their sentiment.  Toward this, Rettig said several companies at the event expressed an interest in funding the development of open-source, sentiment gathering tools, that could better measure the will of identified parties when it came to contentious change.  ""There's general consensus that we need better signals,"" Rettig told CoinDesk.  And while the choice to keep the working group small and invite-only has already ruffled some feathers on Reddit, with some warning that such a formula contradicts the openness of the platform, it was clear from the event documentation that aligning to the community was the central concern.  Rettig told CoinDesk:  “The community is critical to all of us, I can speak as myself as a core developer, I care a great deal about what the community thinks, but I do struggle to gauge sentiment. The single to noise ratio tends to be very low on channels like Reddit.”  Better signals  Of course, it's well-known by now that social media can be a noisy and hostile place.  “Everyone on the internet needs to chill out and not be so mean to everybody,” community manager Hudson Jameson said at the public panel following the event.  Several others echoed this point, stating that while channels such as Twitter and Reddit can be filled with abusive uproar, it’s not clear whether the loudest voices fairly represent the opinions of all.  And when it comes to the platform’s hardest decisions, such as whether to hard fork to return money lost in the Parity fund freeze of November last year, clean signals are crucial.  “There’s a very strong voice for immutability on channels like Reddit,” Dan Finlay, from ethereum wallet MetaMask, said at a later public discussion. “I’m seriously suspicious of those. Maybe they’re sock puppets. I didn’t see them very well represented here.”  As such, event participants put their heads together to better isolate the various groups that have different stake within the platform, including protocol developers, application developers, application users, miners, investors, full nodes, governments and regulators.  The diversity of signals can be collected with purpose-built tooling directed towards each group, and possibly aggregated onto a website, that would visibly depict the different leanings and inclinations.  “What we really want are signal aggregators or bundles of signals,” Retting told CoinDesk in an interview.  And there was a lot of creation discussion on how to achieve this, too.  Speaking in the public panel following the event, Griff Green from decentralized charity Giveth suggested mirroring the efforts deployed by bitcoin in the midst of the scaling debate, using tools like the website Coin.Dance, where the signals sent out by biggest mining pools were neatly depicted.  Rettig also expressed other ideas, that could extend beyond the biggest players to the smaller ecosystem members as well, by including an option in wallet software to signal a position with a simple transaction.  Rettig explained:  “By reducing friction maybe you'll increase participation. Any single signal is by definition not sufficient.”  Crypto's magic power  And when contention remains, there’s always the option to split.  Speaking at the event, several attendees expressed that far from being feared, the ability to create a new version of the ethereum blockchain in the case of divisive decisions is the ultimate, non-coercive tool for dissident groups to enact their opinions.  “Forks are absolutely essential,” Rettig said.  Indeed, in allowing communities the possibility of exit, Rettig and others expressed that the option to split off in case of contention is one of the key advantages that blockchains have over traditional governments.  As such, a dedicated working group on Tuesday discussed how to make forks ""less dire,"" ways to cheapen, increase security and destigmatizing community divides when they do inevitably occur.  “A fork is going to happen. I mean eventually there will be a fork,” Rettig said, though he stressed this sentiment is more theoretical than a commentary on current events.  However, while a split is a clean way to settle disputes, there’s messy, technical complications when it comes to enacting such a divide on ethereum.  Because ethereum is not just a blockchain, but a computation platform as well, every decentralized application would simultaneously co-exist on both versions of the platform.  As well as proving complicated for the many, many businesses that rely on ethereum software, this could spark unanticipated strangeness in other types of decentralized applications as well.  “What happens to a stablecoin?” Rettig asked. “Does it stay at one dollar on both blockchains, and now you have two dollars? Or is it 0.25 cent on one blockchain and 0.75 cent on the other?”  Rettig said that like many of the sessions that occurred over the two days, the result was non-conclusive, but attendees will be running a monthly online meetup dedicated to such conversations.  And it is clear that in spite of risks, splits are a still a value fallback method.  “The fact that in a bloodless way we can neatly fork, and each group can go off and do their own thing, and we can bisect along the lines of values, that is a magic power,” Rettig said.  He concluded:  “We should not be afraid to use it, because that is our magic power.”  Griff Green courtesy of Lane Rettig",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/03/new-ideas-energize-ethereum-though-true-signaling-solution-still-elusive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91aff3dbee53333e3049929548d1747c11d76e26-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the results of the research, which queried chief information officers (CIOs) about their corporate attitudes on the technology, only 1 percent of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organizations. Furthermore, just 8 percent said they were experimenting with blockchain with plans for short-term integration.

Still, it turns out, CIOs aren't uninterested, but they are more careful in approaching implementing blockchain tech.

42401470,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqbO,1525346108,Inclusive Insurance? Businesses See Blockchain As Change-Enabler,"The concept of microinsurance is getting a shot in the arm from new technologies, not least among them blockchain.  A term coined at the turn of the millennium, ""microinsurance"" is often defined as coverage for people on very low incomes. However, the concept has run up against many of the problems faced by microfinance generally. In theory, it’s a great idea, but the practicalities of distribution and operational costs make it unsustainable in many cases.  The most commonly cited use case is coverage to protect small farmers in developing countries from abject weather conditions. From an insurer’s perspective, this can involve writing policies or overseeing a claims-handling process for a single-hectare farm (not much bigger than a soccer field) in the African bush. The associated costs far outweigh the meager premium these types of customers can afford.  Or, to put it in layman’s terms, the juice isn’t worth the squeeze, from the insurer’s point of view.  However, a perfect storm of new tech including blockchain, the internet of things and big data analytics is changing the outlook for microinsurance. Indeed, many experts are now saying these technologies, put together, could upend the whole value chain.  While specialist groups like Microinsurance Network have been touting blockchain’s potential for a couple years, there is now a steady groundswell of startups such as Etherisc and InsurePal looking at combining microinsurance and blockchain.  The potential is also reaching beyond the world of insurtech, with even large insurance companies like Zurich and Axa experimenting with blockchain for this type of coverage.  To push things forward, Etherisc, an insurtech company that builds products on the ethereum blockchain, recently hired an expert on developing-world microinsurance, Michiel Berende, as its inclusive insurance lead.  Berende, who previously lived in India under a grant program to study how coverage can be cheaply deployed, told CoinDesk:  “Today, it is non-insurers that are managing to make inclusive insurance possible, to make it profitable, and to make it interesting.”  Cutting costs  Just last week, Etherisc illustrated how blockchain could help bring efficiencies and lower costs of this type of insurance by introducing weather damage coverage for hurricane-battered Puerto Rico.  In this example, Etherisc’s platform locks up premiums in smart contracts on the public ethereum blockchain. When certain pre-set parameters are met (in this case, a weather sensor picking up high-speed winds), payouts are triggered instantly.  Such quick payment would represent an improvement on the status quo – many of the Puerto Ricans who could afford insurance are still waiting for their claims for damage caused by Hurricane Maria to be processed. Known as parametric insurance, this type of coverage does away with the whole rigmarole of assessing a claim – the insurer simply agrees to make a payment if a triggering event occurs.  And in this specific iteration using a blockchain, other costs are mitigated as well – because, unlike large insurers with thousands of employees, smart contracts don’t need to be paid or housed in skyscrapers, as Etherisc co-founder and CEO Stephan Karpischek likes to point out.  Similarly, Zurich Insurance Group recently revealed a prototype of microinsurance crop insurance on ethereum.  Designed by Martin Baier, Zurich’s program manager for business innovation and development at Zurich, the prototype used an external weather data source API as the oracle to trigger the automatic payout in case of drought or flooding.  The project earned Zurich the distinction of being the only incumbent from its industry to make it to the finals of an insurtech competition held in Zug, Switzerland (nicknamed “crypto valley” for its concentration of blockchain startups).  Another insurance giant, AXA, which recently launched a blockchain-based parametric flight delay product (if the plane is two hours late, the customer gets an automatic payout), is looking at similar applications for rural microinsurance.  Again, the key is having an external data source that would ping the blockchain in the event of payout-triggering events.  “To assess the [crop] yield on a one-hectare farm would be expensive. To significantly reduce costs, you have to use remote-sensing technologies, for example from satellites, to monitor vegetation developments,” said Tanguy Touffut, CEO of AXA Global Parametrics.  Inclusive insurance  Apart from streamlining processes and cutting costs, what really gets some people excited about blockchain in microinsurance is its potential to foster peer-to-peer mutuality – simply put, allowing individuals to take on risks that are currently the preserve of large insurance firms.  What if any group of people could create their own pooling system on the spot? These could be instant mini-insurers or mini-mutuals, suggested Michael Mainelli, co-founder of fintech think tank Z/Yen.  “Over time, this could lead to new players entering the market and disintermediation of traditional insurance through the automation of certain insurance products, probably around well-known and common risks,” said Mainelli.  Yet Etherisc’s Berende sees a broad spectrum of new models. For example, a risk pool to protect small farmers could also involve big players further up the supply chain, like Starbucks or Nestle.  Bringing this type of collaborative commerce to value chains would be a big deal. The world’s population is expected to hit nine billion people in the next 10 or 20 years (some 300,000 extra mouths to feed every day).  Around half a billion small-scale farmers produce crops to meet these needs. Yet they are at the mercy of the palpable effects of global warming which are making weather conditions more severe around the planet.  Trying to close a big deal for a pilot scheme in this area, Berende said he is in discussions about blockchains, smart contracts and risk pools with several conglomerates and a large global charity, none of whom he could name.  These risk pools, which could be part public and part privately-owned, might also include farm-input suppliers, farmers’ co-operatives, donor organizations and government bodies.  Putting this on a blockchain, so to speak, could help ensure that aid money would only be paid out given specific conditions, as per the smart contracts. A lot of money is spent via initiatives to help farmers cope with climate change, but unfortunately, much of it is lost before reaching its intended location.  However, Berende told CoinDesk:  “Blockchain allows us to program money. So if you put money in a risk pool you could be guaranteed the money would only be spent at the correct location.”  African farm image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/03/inclusive-insurance-businesses-see-blockchain-as-change-enabler,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcfde3a8790b8ed07d56534878582f99153f0998-1500x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401481,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqmD,1525341638,Sell In May and Go Away? Not for Bitcoin Bulls,"Sell in May and go away? While the month may traditionally give equity bulls cold feet, it should probably not be a cause of worry for the bitcoin market.  Indeed, it's true the month of May is often a weak period for equities, and that bitcoin has acted as a risk asset (moving in tandem with equities) since February. As such, cryptocurrency investors may fear that a potential drop in equities could end up dragging bitcoin prices lower.  However, historical data suggests that bitcoin is more likely to build upon its April rally this month.  Notably, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has scored gains in the month of May in five out of the last seven years, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  According to the data:  BTC appreciated by 73 percent in May 2017 as it jumped from $1,348 to $2,330.  The decline in the years the price did drop (2015 and 2013) was moderate (less than 10 percent).  Furthermore, BTC has fared well in every second quarter since its creation – the highest being 1,964 percent in Q2 2011, when bitcoin jumped from $0.78 to $16.10.  Clearly, history is on the bulls' side. Further, the seasonality analysis only adds credence to the bullish set up as seen in the bitcoin chart below.  4-hour chart  As discussed yesterday, the observed bull pennant breakout could see the recent rally from the April low of $6,425 (Bitfinex price) extend to $10,000 or even higher.  The cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrowing price range for more than a week and has spent a better part of the last 12 hours trading between $9,150 and $9,300.  As the technical theory has it, the longer the duration of the consolidation zone, the more violent the breakout tends to be. So, BTC could move well above the $10,000 mark in an hour or two post-breakout, if the bulls gain the upper hand.  View  BTC tends to perform well in May, thus an upside breakout of the narrowing price range is more likely and could yield a quick move higher to $10,000.  On the other hand, a downside break would open the doors to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4).  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal a bear revival.

As reported by CoinDesk, Reddit explained in March that Coinbase's decision to disable its Merchant Tool and replace it with a new Coinbase Commerce product had been in part the cause of the site halting its bitcoin payments option.

42401474,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqgJ,1525334451,Bitcoin Futures Trading Questioned By Chinese National Media,"China National Radio (CNR), a high-level government mouthpiece, has aired doubts about the legality of services offered by OKEx, the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange launched by OKCoin, previously one of the ""Big Three"" trading platforms in China.  Through its podcast channel ""Voice of China"" on Thursday and later an article titled ""Exchanges that still prevail after the ban,"" CNR alleged that OKEx violated rules by offering bitcoin contracts to mainland Chinese investors after it claimed to have moved its business overseas.  The broadcaster cited two sources with the surnames Yang and Zhang, allegedly investors who had used OKex's services, claiming that the firm's bitcoin contracts trading is essentially betting on unregulated bitcoin futures with the option to add leverage to increase returns, and risk.  The article went on to blast OKEx for apparently dodging regulations by registering itself in Belize, while having its headquarters based in Hong Kong, a special administrative region outside of mainland China's jurisdiction.  Furthermore, citing its own investigations, the station alleged that OKEx's technological development is still managed by the OKCoin team based in Beijing. In the meantime, CNR said the exchange has continued to offer over-the-counter (OTC) trading that makes cryptocurrency buying and selling available for investors from mainland China.  Notably, today's article forms part of a cryptocurrency investigation series currently being broadcast by the state media outlet.  On Wednesday, CNR aired and published an article written by the same team, taking aim at ICOs that are still offering tokens to Chinese investors even after the notable ban on fund-raising token sales by the People's Bank of China last year.  Citing a former employee of a cryptocurrency project named PROChain, the station specifically alleged the firm, the team of which is mostly China-based, violated regulations by selling tokens to domestic investors without providing substantial technological blockchain development.

42401473,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqeL,1525328157,The Blockchain Data Problem Might Be Bigger Than You Think,"A straightforward data point – the total supply of bitcoin hit 17 million.  But as with most things in crypto, it wasn't so simple.  Every 10 minutes or so, miners find a block of transactions and the network adds 12.5 new bitcoin to the total supply as a reward for the finders. And each reward has been logged on the blockchain since bitcoin launched in early 2009.  As such, it seemed like a number – a milestone – the industry could trust.  But as some celebrated once the mark was hit on bitcoin data provider Blockchain's website, others took to Twitter to rain on their parade.  Jameson Lopp, Casa engineer and the creator of Statoshi.info, another public-facing bitcoin data site, tweeted:  ""Today I've learned that a lot of data sources are incorrectly reporting the total bitcoin supply. We haven't actually hit 17 million BTC yet.""  Lopp's contention was that Blockchain.info, one of the most popular and highly-regarded sources for blockchain network data, among others, had not accounted for instances in which bitcoin miners, due to bugs and other causes, did not claim their full block reward.  Unfortunately, these discrepancies in the total bitcoin supply metric are not the exception, but part of a larger problem that stems from the ""opaque"" methodologies these blockchain data analysis providers use, according to Greg Cipolaro, the CEO of Digital Asset Research (DAR), a firm that provides blockchain analysis to clients.  As such, DAR went on a mission to figure out Blockchain's methods for what it calls ""one of the longest standing mysteries in the cryptocurrency community"" – bitcoin's estimated transaction value. In the company's report on the subject, published recently, DAR said Blockchain over-estimated transaction values from October to February 2017 and has mostly underestimated them since then.  Executives from Blockchain were not available for interview before press time.  But it's not only Blockchain. Cipolaro cited CoinMarketCap's January removal (without warning) of South Korean exchange data from its price index. Since cryptocurrency prices on South Korean exchanges have tended to be higher, the eviction made it appear that the crypto markets were crashing.  Panic selling ensued, setting off what Cipolaro called ""a mini-flash crash.""  In fairness, though, price indices always involve subjective decisions. That is true not only of cryptocurrencies but also the stock market. Yet without insight into how price and other metrics are arrived at, the cryptocurrency community could suffer. Accurate data is extremely important for investors, traders, users, developers, academics, journalists – basically everyone.  A multi-layer problem  Still, many people who depend on public blockchain data don't realize how flawed some of this data is.  Offering a grim outlook on the broad state of blockchain analysis today, Stefan Richter, a computer scientist who co-founded data provider BitcoinPrivacy, told CoinDesk:  ""There are, of course, software bugs in probably every explorer around.""  And Cipolaro echoed that, saying, ""This is not something you would notice unless you spent your days looking at it.""  Luckily, some industry enthusiasts have noticed.  Lopp, for one, is a cryptocurrency data hound. He pointed to bitcoin node count, a figure often cited as a measure of the network's decentralization and health, as a particularly finicky metric.  ""I often hear folks say that there are only 10,000 bitcoin nodes,"" Lopp said. But the source of that figure, Bitnodes, ""only counts reachable nodes that accept incoming connections.""  Addy Yeow, the creator of Bitnodes, confirmed that the site only counts ""listening"" nodes.  As such, the total number of nodes could be far higher, according to both Lopp. Indeed, one estimate puts listening and non-listening nodes at nearly 140,000.  And while Yeow agrees, he cautions that adding non-listening nodes to the metric would require making major assumptions. He explained that data sources that count non-listening nodes are actually taking part in a guessing game. Nodes that aren't listening could still be connected, but behind a firewall, for example. Alternatively, they could have changed IP addresses, or the could have disconnected entirely.  The analysis providers that take into account non-listening nodes use a formula which takes into account the number of days nodes have been non-listening in an effort to count them, but the more unseen-but-connected nodes they capture, the more disconnected nodes they erroneously include.  Getting there  Due to the issues with public data sets, many blockchain data professionals avoid using them and instead use data they calculate internally whenever possible.  Chainalysis, a firm that analyzes blockchain data for clients including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), is certainly skeptical. Kimberley Grauer, Chainalysis' chief economist, said she prefers to use internal data because, ""I know where the errors are; I know where the vulnerabilities are."" DAR's Cipolaro echoed that, telling CoinDesk the company runs its own code, gleaning data from its own bitcoin node.  Still, despite their shortcomings, Cipolaro has high praise for the free sites that make bitcoin data available to the public.  ""They provide a good source of high-quality information,"" he said.  And it's obvious these companies are trying. When a bug in Blockchain's web service made it appear (incorrectly) that bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto had moved some coins, the company fixed the problem.  Certain issues should be easy to fix. Grauer pointed out that block explorers often neglect to note time zones, and they don't all use the same one.

42401469,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczqaP,1525317507,Goldman Sachs to Begin Bitcoin Futures Trading,"Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs will use its own money to trade bitcoin futures on behalf of its clients, according to the New York Times.  The Times reported Wednesday that while the exact launch date of the new trading operation is not yet set, the move came after the bank's board of directors signed off on the initiative. Goldman is also set to ""create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients,"" according to the report.  Goldman executive Rana Yared said the decision resulted from a growing number of inquiries from clients that indicated interest in holding bitcoin as an alternative asset.  “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold bitcoin or bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,’” she told the Times.  The investment bank has hired its first ""digital asset"" trader, Justin Schmidt, to handle the daily operation. Schmidt previously worked as a trader at hedge fund Seven Eight Capital before leaving last year to trade cryptocurrencies.  The news reflects the growing involvement of Goldman in the crypto-market, as CEO Lloyd Blankfein has previously said that the investment bank was clearing bitcoin futures for its clients. Per the Times, any deeper action – including the direct handling of bitcoin – will only come following approval from U.S. regulators.  And according to Yared, Goldman officials have taken a cautious approach throughout the process.  “For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table,"" Yared was quoted as saying, adding:  “It is not a new risk that we don’t understand. It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.”  Goldman Sachs logo image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/03/goldman-sachs-to-begin-bitcoin-futures-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ec5d21d6800b13656d8cffb8e1e9c74ebcc3a6c-1500x1016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said on Tuesday that the regulatory agency has a good chance of proving that Andy Altahawi, Suresh Tammineedi and Dorababu Penumarthi illegally benefited from the pivot. Longfin's price jumped by more than 2,000% last year after it announced the acquisition of a blockchain startup.  In the court order, she wrote:  ""The SEC has shown that it is likely to prove at trial that these defendants participated in an unregistered, illegal public offering of the stock of Longfin Corp.""  As part of this decision, Cote granted a preliminary injunction to the SEC and also maintained a freeze on $27 million worth of assets owned by Altahawi, Tammineedi and Penumarthi that the Commission sought in April.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the SEC alleges that Longfin issued more than two million unregistered restricted shares to Altahawi, and tens of thousands of restricted shares to Penumarthi and Tammineedi, from which the three individuals garnered the now frozen assets in question.  The company's CEO, Venkata Meenavalli, was also initially named as a defendant in the case, but Cote unfroze the assets of both Meenavalli and Longfin on April 23 after the latter demonstrated that neither he nor the company profited from the allegedly illegal offering.  January comments by the SEC Chairman Jay Clayton foreshadowed the Longfin case. He remarked at the time that the Commission is scrutinizing ""the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology"" to ensure that they comply with securities laws.
