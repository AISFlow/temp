42399542,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjh7J,1483803284,Bitcoin in 2016: The Year Politics Challenged Apolitical Money,"Eric Lombrozo is a Bitcoin Core developer and CEO of Ciphrex, a software company developing tools and application development platforms for cryptographic transaction processing.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Lombrozo recaps a fraught year in bitcoin's development history, one that he believes should serve as a reminder of how the community should come together and recognize its common goals.  When I first started working to develop bitcoin applications in 2011, I assumed it was a fairly stable protocol that would be unlikely to change in drastic ways – the rules were well-defined and the network was open to participation by anyone who adhered to these rules.  Despite noting plenty of ways the system's design could have been made better in hindsight, it was clear that getting everyone on the network to adopt changes to these rules would be a difficult task.  It was feasible to have multiple implementations as long as they all followed the same rules. But even relatively small differences in behavior could introduce systemic incompatibilities that would break the network.  In general, it would be much easier to just try creating a new network from scratch, and in fact, a number of people did just that.  I was involved in the early phases of two of such projects, Ripple and ethereum.  New challenges for consensus networks  Extending or modifying decentralized consensus protocols turns out to be an extremely challenging problem.  As opposed to more conventional deployment models in the software industry, providing a migration path for users involves not just requiring backward compatibility with older protocols and data formats – it also requires ensuring that the economic incentive structures that provide the security as well as the eventual consistency of the entire network remain intact.  In particular, when dealing with a distributed financial ledger, it is important that everyone come to agree on its state, and that nobody be able to game it unfairly or violate existing contracts at any stage of an update. I think it's fair to say that the subtle challenges posed by these requirements tend to be often highly underestimated.  Bitcoin encountered its first major protocol upgrade challenge in 2015.  Prior to this, the bitcoin software had been undergoing frequent updates and releases. There had even been a few additions to the protocol itself. But up until 2015, none of these updates had deliberately involved any changes that could potentially severely disrupt incentives or fork the ledger.  There had been minor incidents such as the March 2013 fork that resulted from an undocumented behavior in the database engine. (This caused some nodes to reject a particular block that others had accepted).  But while this particular incident required manual intervention to resolve, the incentives were still sufficiently well-aligned to allow for a coordinated cooperative effort that restored the network's functionality quickly and without significant widespread losses.  Technical changes become political challenges  2015 marked an important turning point.  It was the first time a change was proposed that predictably would alter incentives and would be certain to break compatibility in ways that would not only require extensive logistical coordination but would also lead to controversies that would make the kind of cooperation required for smooth transition extremely difficult.  To the untrained eye, it seemed to be like a very innocuous and simple change, one involving a single parameter that capped transaction blocks at a maximum size of 1 MB.  However, from the perspective of system engineers, what was being proposed was not just a technical change, it was a political powder keg.  In a more conventional network setting, especially one where a small number of players could control the execution environment (such as is the case with deployment of new servers within an organization), such a parameter change would seem like an almost trivial change.  Engineers would have to weigh the tradeoffs in terms of system behavior and costs. Processing bigger blocks would require bigger, more powerful hardware, but the extra costs can be calculated and the organization can decide whether the greater transaction throughput justifies these costs.  However, in a decentralized deployment setting, especially one where participation is voluntary, the entire network is held together by economic incentives in a tight balance, and all network participants must agree to the same rules governing how a financial ledger can be modified.  In this way, even such a seemingly trivial change can become a monumental task fraught with tremendous risks.  Political challenges become social challenges  I had already been working on Bitcoin Core for a few years by this time, and I was already very familiar with many of the difficulties that arise in free, open-source software development. But for the first time, I felt the entire bitcoin network (with a market capitalization in the billions of US dollars) was potentially threatened by rising community tensions.  I, myself, had no particularly strong preferences for a given maximum block size. But I would have liked to see a good long-term solution emerge where block size could increase dynamically as better technology emerges.  This seems to be a common view among many bitcoin developers, but a good solution continues to elude us and will require more work.  What was clear was that attempts to just alter this parameter or remove it were highly controversial, and that the economic incentives keeping the network healthy were at risk.  The fact that it was controversial meant that without overwhelming stakeholder support that could keep the differing incentives in balance, coordinating a smooth transition would be nearly impossible – there was a very real risk of the network splitting in two or more fragments, all of which would be incompatible with one another.  I should point out that no one is to be faulted for this – it is the nature of a system that is designed to be immutable. And had it not been this particular issue, some other controversial issue would have arisen sooner or later.  The problems mentioned above had been discussed to considerable length in public discussions, which continued throughout 2015 and well into 2016. Perhaps what was most surreal was seeing the community splinter and fragment as inaccurate information flooded outwards.  Camps formed, largely based on events occurring on social forums and a few stories pushed by mainstream media that many engineers viewed as tangential to the essence of the problem. Perhaps ironically, the response to these ended up resembling quite closely the kinds of scenarios that some had anticipated might result from controversial protocol change proposals.  It became clear then that despite the issue having arisen due to a technical challenge – namely, how to scale transaction throughput while keeping fees low and the network decentralized – the biggest challenge bitcoin was facing at this time was not technical but political and social.  A campaign attempting to circumvent the technical review process had been unleashed, and the existing technical review process at the time was ill-equipped to handle this kind of scenario.  Moving beyond politics  With this, 2016 was the year that the term ""hard fork"" entered the popular lexicon – it was the year the world would see the first highly publicized occurrence of a contentious hard fork on a consensus network with significant capitalization.  This occurred, of course, on the ethereum network after a major project – The DAO – was hacked, which caused the ethereum network to split into two different networks.  For those who are new to the term, a hard fork is any change to consensus rules in a decentralized consensus network that would cause nodes that adopt the changes to fork off to a separate network from nodes that do not adopt the changes.  If the changes in question are universally supported by all network participants, then the problem of deployment reduces to one of logistics. These sorts of logistical issues are still quite intricate and carry risks – but they can be tackled via technical means – and it is within the scope of engineering to find workable solutions.  However, if the changes are controversial, the problem ceases to be within the realm of engineering and becomes political.  Emphatically, bitcoin and proof-of-work blockchains generally do not offer solutions to the basic political problems that have plagued humanity since prehistoric times. Thousands of years of history have demonstrated that the resolution of political disputes is a very hard problem fraught with social unrest, and at times resulting in war and bloodshed.  What bitcoin offers is a form of money that is defined by algorithmic rules, enforced not by some external party but by the natural economic and social incentives of the participants within the system, in a decentralized manner.  Participation in networks like bitcoin is voluntary.  In the event of an incompatible ledger change that is controversial, unless the different parties are able to arrive at some resolution, either one party must coerce the others into adhering; or the parties must all go their separate ways.  Coercing people to change their software takes us outside the realm of computer code. Even if a reasonably fair democratic process existed and were to be used (and that's a huge if), it significantly degrades the voluntary nature of participation.  And if the parties go their separate ways, the network fragments, reducing its utility and destroying people’s confidence in the underlying financial assets.  For bitcoin to have value, we need a robust, global network that can withstand determined, well-funded attacks. It must retain its security and stability even in times of turmoil.  As we begin 2017, I encourage people to look to ways we can continue to build upon this technology while avoiding divisive scenarios that could threaten to destabilize or fragment the network.

42399544,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjhAG,1483794893,The Only 10 Bitcoin Stock Photos You'll Ever See,"Bitcoin: you can't see it, you can't touch it, but you've still got to find some way to illustrate an article about it day after day, week after week.  It's actually a trade secret in the bitcoin industry that there are only 10 types of bitcoin stock images in existence, with the illusion of variety being created by making slight variations of these template pictures and hoping desperately that none of the readers will notice.  In this feature, CoinDesk explains the secret meaning behind the only bitcoin images you'll ever see.  Be warned, the world may never look the same again.  1. The Miner  You know the great thing about 'mining' as a metaphor? There’s a ton of pictures of it.  But since modern mines actually look like the set of a Lord of the Rings movie, it’s better to picture the golden age of mining, where a hobo with a strong back and a dream could hitch his way out to the Klondike and come back richer than your grandma’s beef stew.  What’s the hashrate of that pickaxe, pardner?  2. The Bitbrain  Look at this guy: he's got bitcoin on the brain, literally.  He can’t think of anything else. ""Dedicated"", you might think, ""good for him"". What you don't know is that he’s slowly starving to death in his apartment because he hasn’t stopped watching the price ticker for 72 hours straight, his girlfriend left because he spent more time on r/btc than he did with her, and now he won’t even answer calls from his mom.  Poor dude.  3. The Skyline  The year is 2025, the place, somewhere finance-y, probably Asia because they're already a little bit in the future.  Dramatically lit skyscrapers loom in the background, adorned with some form of the bitcoin logo and a liberal use of the Photoshop glow filter.  Disembodied symbols float through the air: stock charts, chat bubbles, perhaps a Wi-Fi sign or two: it's like William Gibson writing a dramatized version of Roger Ver's twitter feed.  'The Skyline' tells you that the future of money is here and it's going to blow your tiny mind.  4. The Triple-M  Put the bitcoin on ya phone, bada-bing bada-boom, three words for ya baby: magic mobile money.  Fuhgeddaboutit.  5. The Counterpoint  You know what people in the bitcoin community never talk about? The fact that cryptocurrency is better than fiat.  So just to be absolutely clear, here’s a picture of a bitcoin beating fiat currency in some way: displacing the dollar, outperforming the pound, roundhousing the rupee, fencing the franc, knifing the naira, boxing the baht, wristlocking the riyal, and powerbombing the peso off the top rope into a steel chair.  You get the idea.  6. The Blockchain: Reloaded  ""Let me tell you why you’re here. You’re here because you felt something. You’ve felt it your entire life: There’s something wrong with the world. You don’t know what it is, but it’s there. Like a splinter in your mind. Driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I’m talking about?""  ""The Blockchain.""  ""Do you want to know what it is...?""  7. The Collage  Time was, if you wanted to make a collage you had to go to the trouble of finding some magazines, cutting out pictures, gluing them together ... but no more! These days you can stitch together a heavy handed visual metaphor faster than you can say ‘successful businessman’.  So here’s a tip: combine any object with a picture of some circuitry and you’re showing that it’s like that thing – but more tech.  A globe and some wires? The Internet! Money and a motherboard? Bitcoin! You can try it out at home, but be careful, kids.  8. The Point of Sale  INT Boardroom, day.  [Executive 1]: Tompkins, bitcoins don't have a physical form. There's no way we can photograph them. It's impossible.  [Executive 2]: But the deadline is in two hours! You and I both know we're finished at this firm if we don’t come up with something. Think, dammit. Think.  [Exec 1, quietly]: What if… what if you dressed up as a man who… accepts bitcoin?  [Exec 2]: That’s so crazy it just might work! Get me a chalkboard and my best tie, stat!  9. The Lock ’n’ Key  Sure, storing bitcoins safely these days means putting them in a triple factor cold storage nuclear bunker in space, but isn’t that basically the same as locking it with a big lock? I thought so.  This picture represents the kind of safety and security that we had in the good old days when the world was still made up of physical things that you could touch.  ""Remember physical things?"" you’ll say one day over a pint of cybeer in your favourite VR bar. ""Things were great weren’t they? Back when they were actually made of stuff. They don’t build ‘em like that any more do they?""  Then you’ll pay the tab in Ultracoin 10.5 Classic Plus and vanish off into the void.  10. The HUD  Who is this man? What kind of display is he using? Are we trapped in the computer? Is he sending a bitcoin ransom to get us out, or will Tom Cruise stop it before it even happens?  We may never know.  --  The people at Shutterstock have kindly prepared a bigger selection of images for all your bitcoin stock photo needs. Take a look here!",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Corin Faife,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/07/the-only-10-bitcoin-stock-photos-youll-ever-see,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8365cff60fe9d205eb6732cd186d80bb1a1898f6-2560x1345.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42399522,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjgrZ,1483758941,"China to Restrict Bitcoin Marketing, But Blockchain Firms Unaffected","Just hours after it was first revealed that the People's Bank of China (PBoC) had held closed-door meetings with domestic bitcoin exchanges, new details are emerging about the conversations.  According to a new report by Caixin, the PBoC sought to restrict how the exchanges could seek to acquire potential new users, with the central bank indicating that the startups aren't able to mention the depreciation of the yuan in connection with marketing or otherwise promote their services offline.  Some of the involved exchanges were said to have cancelled planned activities that would have potentially utilized such a strategy.  The article further states that exchanges were advised to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws, and to refrain from using automated trading bots to boost volume, according to translation provided by Eric Zhao, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  A regional exchange employee wishing to remain anonymous dismissed the news as ""no big deal"" and unlikely to be motivated by any fears that bitcoin may compete with the yuan.  Another exchange employee, who wished to remain unidentified, expressed dissatisfaction with the reporting, alleging that some of the directives were not in fact new, though he did not provide clarity on which might have been previously given.  Past precedent provides some hints, though, as bitcoin companies in the region, in one instance, have previously backed out of public conferences due to regulatory pressure.  The comments notably follow news that China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is looking into bitcoin under its mandate for stopping capital flight.  At press time, representatives from BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin had yet to respond to requests for comment.  No impact on blockchain  Notably, such instructions do not appear to have been given to startups working on blockchain projects or implementations using the distributed ledger technology behind bitcoin or alternative cryptographic tokens.  DJ Qian, CEO of blockchain-as-a-service startup BitSE, for example, indicated that the news ""does not affect its business"" due to its focus on non-monetary applications, a statement that was echoed in other responses.  Tong Li, CEO of Circle China, the bitcoin and blockchain-based messaging service, noted that he is not concerned about the directives or its impact on Circle's operations.  However, he did suggest that the announcement would be worth ""following closely"".  Blockchain investor Bo Shen, founding partner of Fenbushi Capital, expressed similar sentiment, indicating that he had not been in contact with any central bank officials about the topics discussed with bitcoin exchanges.  Shen is one of the more prolific investors in China-based blockchain projects, backing firms including Juzhen Financials as well as a number of open-source, alternative blockchain projects.  Adding potential insight is that Shen did offer a few words of advice to local exchanges, adding:  ""Two things I would like to remind those exchanges: high volatility is not good and strict accordance with KYC and AML.""

42379151,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7n9Dz,1483748517,2013 to 2017: Comparing Bitcoin's Biggest Price Rallies,"Is it 2013 or 2017?  For bitcoin's investors, traders and enthusiasts, an answer to this question might be harder to give today than you might imagine.  Bitcoin prices surged above the $1,100 mark this week (near all-time highs) only to sink back down to earth amid higher volatility and foreboding – if not unclear – news out of China. Taken together, the developments evoke memories of 2013, when the price of bitcoin surged to similar levels, bringing the digital currency to international attention.  Both rallies were buoyed by bullish sentiment among those actually trading in the market, and somewhat more eerily, both would face headwinds from events in China.  At the same time, the ecosystem is fundamentally different today than it was in 2013-2014, both in terms of the exchange ecosystem (where the majority of trades are happening) and the amount of public interest in the digital currency itself (and its underlying blockchain technology).  So, how do the two bull-runs stack up side-by-side?  We explore some similarities and differences below using data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index and data provider Bitcoinity, as well as comments from industry participants.  1. 2013's rally was short-lived  First, let’s start with the price.  The graph below shows the price as it progressed from 6th September to 6th January in 2013, a four-month period during which the price shot past the $1,100 mark to its highest price ever.  Now, let’s take a look at the past three months.  Seems a bit different, right? Or maybe not? Now that we’ve laid the scenes for the respective rallies, let’s compare the two.  The most glaring difference developing between the two rallies lies in how quickly they came together. Prices climbed quickly during the 2013 rally, soaring more than $600 in a two-week period.  By contrast, the recent rally developed more slowly over time. This state of affairs changed over time, particularly as December drew to a close, and prices inched closer to $1,000.  The data suggests that the 2013 rally was far more volatile in its buildup, whereas in the aftermath of the peak, there are more similarities in terms of volatility.  In total, the price of bitcoin was above $1,000 for just 10 days in 2013, and only one day in 2014, according to BPI data. In 2013, prices quickly returned to the $600-$700 level, a low that, at press time, hadn't yet been reached in 2017.  On the other hand, both have similarities.  Both rallies were buoyed by bullish sentiment among stake-holders, with those trading or watching the markets expressing a strong belief that markets would keep on rising – ""to the moon"", so to speak.  2. Volume is now higher  Price data, however instructive, is only part of the picture, though.  To look at another side – and gain a window into some of the ecosystem differences between now and then – one should take a closer peek at volume data between the respective rallies.  For that, we'll turn to data provider Bitcoinity, which publishes information on global bitcoin trading markets.  Let’s cast a wide net and look at the volume picture over a five-year period, predating the 2013 run.  Some obvious differences emerge.  For starters, trading in 2013 was largely contained to the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox – in its heyday, as much as 90% of the world’s non-OTC bitcoin trading traffic passed through the market.  This stands in sharp contrast to today’s picture, in which bitcoin has several China-based exchanges that play host to a majority of trading, with other markets, like Bitstamp, Bitfinex and Coinbase serving sizeable portions of the market as well.  What’s more, trading volumes – denominated in BTC – was much lower back then, the data suggests.  A key difference emerges: traders are simply exchanging more bitcoins, which could be a result of an increase in algorithmic trading, a rise in the number of traders or other factors that aren’t immediately apparent when looking at the data. Bitcoinity’s data on the amount of trades-per-minute bears out this theory to some extent.  It's in this volume picture that the differences between the two rallies can be seen more clearly.  Trading has taken place across a broader number of exchanges in a more developed exchange ecosystem. Further, during the first rally, trading was largely contained to what has since been established as a fraudulent exchange that was at the time insolvent.  Bram Ceelen, co-founder of cryptocurrency brokerage Anycoin Direct, told CoinDesk that he believes this is an important difference, noting how he believes what was a market bolstered by manipulation in 2013 is now more mature.  ""Bitcoin is on the radar of a lot more wealthy investors and other people as in 2013. At that time it was complete madness and greed (plus maybe the effects of Willy bot) that drove up the price,” he told CoinDesk.  Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles would later be arrested under suspicion of fraud and embezzlement.  3. Markets are more leveraged  Another notable development is the rise of leveraged trading.  In 2013, most major exchanges only offered buying and selling options (and was the case with Mt Gox), sometimes even this simple service wasn't always reliable or dependable.  Now, however, a number of major bitcoin exchanges allow traders to take out 5x, 10x or even 20x leverage on bitcoin traders.  These large positions now make the market volatile as traders can consolidate large positions around certain price points.  Such was the case earlier this week when sell orders in the $900-range were liquidated, causing the price to drop precipitously in just an hour.  Yet, despite the huge losses suffered here, Petar Zivkovski, COO of Whaleclub, argued that there were more fundamental underpinnings behind the most recent rally – and decline.  ""In 2013, the rise was powered by speculation and the ensuing selloff was the result of early adopters cashing in around the $1,000 psychological level,” Zivkovski explained. “It was both an unhealthy rise and selloff.""  He told CoinDesk:  “This year's rise was powered by much more fundamental and strong catalysts: the halving in July, capital controls by governments around the world, the yuan devaluation, economic and political uncertainty and turmoil (Brexit, Trump), war on cash (India), etc. This made bitcoin very attractive as a non-governmental, decentralized means of holding and transferring value.”  4. The ecosystem is more mature  Others pointed to less tangible details.  Marco Streng, CEO of hosted mining firm Genesis Mining, posited that it was the 2013 rally itself that set the stage for the recent price run – and that growth in the broader bitcoin and blockchain industry was part and parcel to that development.  Since that time, more than $1bn has been invested in bitcoin companies, with many providing services that enable its blockchain to be more useful as a payment network, remittance channel or vehicle for speculation.  He told CoinDesk:  ""A lot has happened in the time between the all-time high in 2013 and now. The industry has grown a lot and become stronger, through innovation, and endurance.""
