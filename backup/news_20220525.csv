42374645,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1dBh,1653521928,First Mover Asia: Regulatory Attention on Terra Could Change South Korean Trading Environment; Bitcoin Goes Sideways,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other major cryptos trade sideways.  Insights: In the aftermath of the Terra implosion, South Korea's crypto trading environment could change. Here's what might happen.  Technician's take: BTC has shown no signs of life but a volatile price move is likely.

Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $29,612 -0.05%  Ether (ETH): $1,945 -1.5%  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Chainlink LINK −4.0% Computing Cosmos ATOM −3.7% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −3.5% Smart Contract Platform  Bitcoin travels sideways  Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies traveled sideways for the second consecutive day.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $29,700, up slightly and roughly where it stood 24 and 48 hours earlier. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was down over a percentage point, still changing hands a little below the $2,000 level it has held much of this week. Other cryptos were mixed, some rising a little and others falling, although metaverse tokens MANA and SAND had a good day with SAND climbing over 7% at one point. TRX was also recently up more than 5%.  A number of crypto markets analysts say that bitcoin will remain in the $28,500 to $30,500 range it has held since the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin two weeks ago until investors have clarity in how the current uncertain environment of high inflation and sagging economic indicators will resolve itself. According to minutes of their last meeting, released Wednesday, Federal Reserve officials indicated they would have to raise interest rates by 0.5% at each of their next two meetings. The U.S. central bank hiked the rate by the same amount on May 4, but has continued to face criticism for not adopting more hawkish monetary remedies sooner to tame rising prices.  Stocks did better than they have for much of the past few months with the tech-heavy Nasdaq rising 1.5% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average increasing more moderately. Cryptos and equities have suffered as investors have shied away from riskier assets. Gold and yields on 10-year Treasuries sank.  Brent crude oil, a measure of energy market prices, hovered over $111 per barrel, and with the summer U.S. travel season approaching, demand for oil is expected to be strong.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program Wednesday, Michael Sonnenshein, the CEO of crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments, a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, noted the ""selling pressure"" and volatility in digital assets but also that the same trends had infected other investment classes.  ""Whether it's tech, crypto or really anything, I can't think of many things that had been sheltered from this recent pullback,"" Sonnenshein said. ""There have also been events like Terra that have led to additional selling pressure.""  But Sonnenshein added optimistically: ""In the near term, we will find our footing.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,978 +0.9%  DJIA: 32,120 +0.6%  Nasdaq: 11,434 +1.5%  Gold: $1,853 -0.7%  Insights  South Korea's trading environment could change  The implosion of Terra’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin terraUSD (UST) could change South Korea’s frenzied crypto trading market as regulators pay more attention to the situation, two founders of prominent crypto-related organizations said.  The country, a hotbed of trading activity, could tighten restrictions on listings and make it difficult for foreign tokens to list on Korean exchanges, discouraging projects from even trying.  “There are a few elements that might get impacted, especially with the listing part,” Doo Wan Nam, a South Korean who leads growth at MakerDAO and is the founder of crypto venture fund StableNode, told CoinDesk.  UST lost its tie earlier this month as investors sold it for other U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, including tether (USDT), in the absence of adequate liquidity, causing UST's price to fall to as low as 7 cents. The luna (LUNA) token that supports the Terra ecosystem lost 99.7% of its value following UST’s failure and Terra-based decentralized finance (DeFi) applications dropped over $28 billion in locked value.  Suicide helplines flooded Terra-centric community forums in the days following the implosion. At the center of the drama is Terraform Labs, the Singapore-based company behind Terra, and its Korean founder Do Kwon. Kwon is infamous for responding to critics with condescension and even calling for the death of other stablecoin projects.  As per local reports, regulators could tighten listing norms for crypto exchanges in the country as they try to protect the everyday investor from a Terra-like repeat. This could, however, lead to the limitations on how coins are listed and offered to local investors.  Doo noted the potential addition of “safeguards on exchanges” to ensure they meet certain requirements, including “white paper and regular disclosers (updates) from listed coins,” adding, “We aren't sure whether they will implement such but, if so, it would put a burden on bothKorean exchanges and also listed coins.”  Decentralized finance-focused tokens from foreign companies may struggle to enter the Korean market altogether: “Many foreign-based coins, especially DeFi, might be difficult to list on Korean exchanges as such compliance would be difficult to enforce,” Doo explained.  Korea remains one of the world’s largest crypto trading regions, with $2.5 billion worth of tokens traded in the past 24 hours within the country's exchanges alone.  Meanwhile, some market observers say retail traders in Korea – known for their aggressive futures and altcoin trading – could hold off from trading risky assets.  “Given what's happening, the degens may become more cautious in their attitude to the conservative assets,” said Alexander Tkachenko, founder of commodities-based token platform VNX, told CoinDesk. “Regulated crypto products as well as stablecoins backed by real assets such as gold may benefit.”  Technician's take  Bitcoin Stabilizes in Tight Range; Support at $27K, Resistance at $30K-$35K  Bitcoin (BTC) is in a consolidation phase, which is defined by a tight price range with low trading volume. So far, the cryptocurrency has struggled to make a decisive move above $30,000, which is near the top of its recent range.  BTC is up by 3% over the past 24 hours, and momentum has improved over the past week. That means buyers could remain active above the $27,500 support level.  The sharp down move on May 12 toward $25,300 occurred on high volume, which could be a sign of capitulation, albeit less significant than in the previous sell-off.  Still, despite room for a price bounce, upside appears to be limited because of negative momentum readings on the weekly and monthly charts.

We expect a conclusion on this within a couple of weeks. Several experts assert that adopting TFR in its current form would establish a massive financial surveillance regime over non-fungible tokens (NFTs), European decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse. Consequently, businesses in those regions might relocate to avoid the regulations. The German DeFi community is yet to cease communication. Instead, they have written an open letter to the European Union decision-makers, which supporters can sign. Peter Grosskopf from Unstoppable Finance, who in 2017 was a co-founder of Solarisbank, is one of the numerous individuals who initiated the letter. Grosskopf served as the Stuttgart Digital Exchange&apos;s chief technology officer the previous year before launching his personal DeFi project with Omid Aladini and Maximilian von Wallenberg. In an interview about his interest in DeFi, Peter Grosskopf shared his thoughts about the proposed TFR regulations and the current sentiments of the DeFi community in Germany. He said, &apos;Nearly everything we can do with a bank today, we can now do ourselves with DeFi apps.

The collapse had no doubt reduced faith in the cryptocurrency market and has seen investors significantly reduce their activity in the space. This has led to losses across the board for miners as fee revenues, transaction volumes, and transaction values have all plummeted, all of which have seen daily miner revenues fall towards yearly lows. Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Declines The previous week had seen on-chain activity ramp up during the height of the LUNA collapse.

Nvidia’s said first-quarter revenue for its “OEM and Other” business unit fell 52% to $158 million from the same quarter last year due to a decline in its cryptocurrency mining processor sales, according to a filing.  The chip maker didn’t disclose the specific amount of sales for its mining processor unit in the first quarter, but labeled it as “nominal” and down from $155 million a year ago.  This comes after the sales of the CMP unit continued to decline with the price of cryptocurrencies in general. In Nvidia’s previous quarter, CMP revenue fell 77% from the previous quarter.  Nvidia’s total first-quarter revenue was $8.29 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $8.12 billion, according to FactSet. Its “OEM and Other” unit contributed only about 2% of the first quarter revenue.  Adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 beat consensus estimates of $1.30. However, Nvidia gave fiscal second-quarter sales guidance of $8.10 billion, which missed the consensus estimate of $8.399 billion.

42417147,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3jB,1653514479,How to Make It in the Metaverse,"Going out for coffee is the best part of the day. She leaves her tiny apartment with her sullen roommates and goes to a cafe two blocks away. She customizes every order. Today it is cookies and cream and almond and vanilla foam, with a dash of green pistachio for flair. There’s coffee in there too, but it’s kind of beside the point. She orders the largest size, always iced.  “That’ll be $32.85,” the barista says.  Sure, the coffees add up, but it doesn’t even matter. What else is she going to buy? New York City was expensive before inflation spun out of control, but now it’s unlivable. She is a designer with a decent income, yet purchasing a home or a car is impossible. Even a grown-up piece of furniture feels out of reach. Not like she would have anywhere to put it, anyway. Her landlord is planning to raise the rent in two months, and she will probably have to move, though she has no idea where.  This work of fiction is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week  “So what’s the latest?” the barista asks. She has told him about her upcoming move, mostly because he’s one of the only people that she regularly interacts with in real life. His living situation is even worse than hers. He lives in an equally small apartment, but it’s a 90-minute commute away. She knows his working hours and plans her visits around them which sometimes feels a little pathetic, but he always seems genuinely happy to see her, even a little nervous sometimes. He’s tall with expressive eyes and has the best collection of sneakers she has ever seen.  “Right now my two best options are moving back in with my parents or leaving the city. But I have no idea where to go. So yeah, it’s not looking great.”  “Have you thought about buying land in the Iroverse?”  “Where?”  “It’s a world that came out last month, one of my good friends from college is a co-founder,” he says.  “What do you mean, a world?”  “A virtual world. Like a game.”  “Oh right.”  She has already lost interest in this conversation. She tried the whole metaverse thing a few years ago and didn’t get what the hype was about. At the time VR was still terrible, and she had to use her laptop keyboard to awkwardly move her avatar back and forth on a computer screen. She found herself wandering alone through pixelated, largely industrial landscapes. Where was everyone? She would be relieved to log off and return to her apartment, which was boring and alienating in a more familiar way.  She recognizes, of course, that a lot has changed since then. VR no longer sucks, for one. No more clunky headsets, now the hardware is as light as a pair of reading glasses. She has spent plenty of time in her little room hiking lush trails, playing tennis with strangers or soaring over mountains and rivers in China, just because that is something you can do. She has heard about buying and selling virtual land, but it all sounds complicated and unnecessary. She has enough problems in the real world.  She doesn’t really want to hear about the Iroverse, but she wants even less to go home to the roommates she hardly knows and their passive-aggressive gray cat.  So she asks, “You can buy land there?”  “I just bought my first plot,” he says. “It’s not that big, but it’s in an amazing location, and it’s enough to build on. I’ve already started working on the designs. My friend said he’d help. I’m going to be a homeowner,” he says with a laugh, but she can tell he is really excited.  “But … why?”  “Because I’m sick of the commute. And I want my own space.”  “But you can’t actually live there?”  “It’s an investment property. If Iro does as well as we think it will, I’ll sell it and buy a place in New York.”  “Wow,” she says, because she doesn’t know what else to say. She notices that a line has formed in the cafe. A woman behind her sighs dramatically.  “I guess I better go.”  There is a pause. Then he says, “I’ll be there tonight. Why don’t you come check it out?”  Now he has her full attention. This is the first time he’s ever suggested meeting outside of the cafe.  “Sure,” she says. “I’ll be there.”  ***  It’s immediately clear that Iro is different. First, it’s easy to use. She puts on her glasses and boom, she is surrounded. Second, the designers are top-tier. The world is majestic, glimmering. She is in a green field with infinite space. There is dew on the grass and delicately colored wildflowers. Above her is a soft blue sky with a pale half-moon. As evening progresses the blue deepens, and the moon grows brighter.  She creates an avatar. She chooses a face shape, hair style and eye color that are close to her own. She dresses as carefully as she would for a date. After changing many different times, she chooses a white dress with clean, simple lines. The game suggests she add an oversized orange bag, even though can’t see why she would need a bag or what she would put in it. She considers adding a pair of sunglasses, then remembers that it’s night.  Read More: Living as NFTs in the Metaverse  She thinks she looks pretty good, at least until the barista appears beside her. His jeans are exactly the right cut yet still somehow inventive, and his red sweatshirt fits his digital frame perfectly. He is wearing high-top sneakers made up of golden light beams.  She feels like a loser.  “Those shoes …” she says. “I didn’t see anything like them when I chose my avatar.”  “Yeah,” he says. “The shoes are giveaways for participants in Iro’s first round.” His body language and facial expressions are remarkably similar to real life. She looks down at her sad white flats.  “Check your bag,” he says.  Her big orange bag now contains the same pair of sneakers, except in silver.  “Are you serious!?”  “Welcome to the first round. It was oversubscribed, but I got my friend to let you in.”  ***  Iro’s first round only includes a few thousand people, namely friends and contacts of the founding team, as well as those who were quickest to sign up. Soon, the game will be open to everyone. Because the world is new and thinly populated, land is affordable. So after a couple days of exploring Iro, she decides to just go for it. A huge map looms in front of her. Some patches have been filled in where people have already claimed plots. The land in the center of the map is most expensive, and the prices go down as you move further toward the periphery.  The barista has a small plot right near the center. She wonders if he got a discount from his friend. She can’t understand why location would even matter – she can just teleport anywhere she wants to go. She trades some dollars for IVRS, the platform’s digital currency, and buys a little plot roughly near the upper right corner of the map.  Once the purchase goes through, she is surprised to feel a sharp thrill. She has always been a renter, putting her fate in the hands of NYC landlords. She never imagined she would have land of her own. The deed is on a blockchain, forever. She can do whatever she wants with it. No one can ever take it away from her.  She starts building right away. She wants it to be the total opposite of her NYC apartment. She chooses light wood, high ceilings, minimalist decor. Bright white walls. Iro offers some of the materials for free, but she uses her IVRS to purchase some extras, like a huge bay window. Through it, she can see a little body of water in the distance. She fully throws herself into the task. She finds an online forum about building in Iro and purchases some software to help her with the architecture.  Read More: Location, Location, Location: Investing in Real Estate in the Metaverse  Every minute that she is not working or sleeping she is building her house. She doesn’t even go to the cafe, because she can now see the barista in Iro. His own house is rudimentary, basically just a small, empty brown box with a bar and a turntable – a virtual bachelor pad.  Finally, she is done. The structure is sturdy, if not spectacular, and the roof is a little lopsided. But she doesn’t care. She has a small, two-story home. In her New York apartment, her view is of another little apartment just a few feet away. She can constantly hear the guy upstairs pacing back and forth, her ceiling vibrating from the impact. Now, she is barefoot in her brand-new master bedroom, looking out of her huge window at a vast expanse of digital nothing. She can’t remember the last time she felt this happy.  She leaves Iro to go make a sandwich. One of her roommates is working on his laptop at the kitchen table, his papers and empty coffee mugs covering the whole surface. He barely looks up when she walks in, just gives her a faint nod. She’s not even sure what kind of work he does. On the counter, his gray cat is looking at her in a vaguely confrontational way. She just smiles back. She is already building a life somewhere else.  ***  She spends as much time as possible in her new home, walking barefoot up and down the stairs (there are stairs!) and planting a little rose garden in the front. The barista visits less often now because he started DJing on the porch of his house. She stops by one of his shows to find a small crowd has gathered, including some impossibly stylish female avatars. People are tipping him in IVRS, and a company even bought a small advertisement to post on the side of his house.  She still loves her house but is starting to realize there’s not that much to do there. The solitude and emptiness that first attracted her to her plot of land is now starting to feel a little bit desolate. She now understands the logic of land prices. Even though she can go anywhere in the world with a click of a button, social activity tends to be concentrated at the center of the map.  The larger problem is that her real-world landlord is still planning to raise the rent. And so far, all she has done in Iro is spend. She finds herself frequently exchanging dollars for IVRS, which she then spends on digital gardening tools or paintings for her walls. Her most extravagant purchase is a virtual horse, which also requires a stable and a lot of hay. The barista is making money in Iro, and she has to find a way to do the same.  Her business idea arrives, as they often do, by accident. The barista is taking a break from his set, and they meet at a new independent cafe in Iro, next to his house. The cafe is cute with bright cushions and a breezy outdoor patio, but the coffees themselves are crudely drawn. Just white cups with inky liquid inside. She feels the owner missed a critical detail.  “No one would buy this on the outside,” she whispers, so the cafe’s owner won’t overhear.  She raises her hand, and a pencil appears in front of her. She draws an elaborate beverage with swirls of brilliant pink and sparkling ice cubes. She adds creamy white foam and tops it with a bright red strawberry.  “That’s it,” the barista says, watching her draw with his wide avatar eyes. “You could totally sell that as an NFT.”  “Really?”  “Think about it: A strawberry latte that you can keep forever.”  ***  She starts making drinks and sells them outside his house while he DJs. She wouldn’t have thought there would be so much demand for immutable lattes, but there you are. People love them. She adds matcha and chai and even fruit smoothies. Each beverage is one of a kind, and she finds herself scrambling to meet demand. A constant flow of IVRS enters her wallet.  It helps that Iro has entered its second round and is now open to more people. New users rush in every day, and now there is a waitlist for round three. The map is no longer empty: Houses are sprouting up everywhere, though her neighborhood is still relatively quiet.  A famous rapper buys the property two doors down from the barista, attracting a swarm of fans to the area. The music carries down the street so whenever the rapper performs the barista opens for him, although the rapper never actually agreed to this. The barista’s little house now features various ads by companies that want to capitalize on the location’s traffic. This all benefits her too, as she sells most of her drinks at his shows.  The problem is, she hardly sees him anymore. When he DJs, she can’t even reach him through the dense crowd. Only once she gets close enough to say, “hey,” but he doesn’t hear her. Or maybe he does, but he is too distracted to respond.  She misses talking to him but doesn’t have time to dwell on it. Her business is taking off, buoyed by various tailwinds. IVRS is now listed on a variety of exchanges. Journalists are dazzled by the beauty of Iro’s landscape, just as she was on her first visit, and articles are appearing in America’s biggest publications. Celebrity actors, athletes and singers are sweeping in, spending millions of dollars on property and pushing up prices all over the map. The price of IVRS is up over nearly 1,000% since she first moved in. It feels a little frenzied, but the value of her home is skyrocketing, so she is not about to complain.  Read More: Crypto Mortgages: How You Can Buy a House Using a Crypto-Backed Loan  But then. One day she notices a woman carrying a gorgeous caramel-colored beverage, except it’s not one of her designs. She zooms in on the cup and sees the logo of the most famous coffee brand in the world. It turns out this company has bought prime real estate smack in the middle of town. She sees ads everywhere. The company has hired a team of world-class designers to create every kind of beverage imaginable. They are also constantly airdropping free drinks and initiating complex rewards programs.  She doubles down. She hires more designers, buys better software and invests in a more vivid and wide-ranging color palette. She also purchases a ton of ads for her drinks, but it’s not even a tiny fraction of what her competitor can afford. As she is fighting for the life of her small business, she can hear the distant sounds of her phone, as her real-life clients ask, where are you, what is going on? She is now only working part-time on the outside and is considering quitting for good.  But she can’t, not yet. She needs all the income she can get. Iro is starting to feel just as expensive as the world she came from. She has now converted so many dollars into IVRS that her bank account balance flashes red. She has already told her landlord that she is leaving but has absolutely no idea what her next move will be. She is sleeping only two to three hours a night and when she runs into one of her roommates in the hallway, he seems almost concerned.  “You OK?” he asks, though it’s not exactly a question.  “You know, just hustling.”  He gives her a faint nod and then goes into his room and quietly shuts the door.  The barista is hustling too, so much that he is not even answering her messages. She goes to see him DJ and waits until the crowd thins out. He is slumped over his turntable, exhausted. Now he has to compete with some of the most well-known DJs in the world. She starts making her way over to him, but then a flash of cobalt catches her eye, and she abruptly stops. There is a familiar logo on the door frame behind him. It takes a minute to register because she can’t believe what she is seeing. The barista has sold an ad to the massive coffee chain that is crushing her business. She has been sending him frantic messages for days, so he knows how hard it has been. She feels so betrayed that she can’t even move. She logs off for the night.  ***  A young couple moves in next door. Now, when she looks out of her huge bay window she sees directly into their yard. If that weren’t bad enough, the couple buys an expensive-looking cat that spends most of its time skulking around outside. For some reason the new animal’s code sets off her horse, who neighs in anguish every time the cat passes by. So now she has to reach into her IVRS wallet yet again to construct a fence that hides the cat from view.  Her drinks are still selling, but she’s had to diversify her menu and now makes cocktails as well. She hires more people to help. The cost of materials is high, and she is barely breaking even. Her one solace is at least she has her house.  But even that investment feels insecure. Her property has value in Iro, and in Iro alone. If the game fails, it will take her house down with it. Iro life is as vibrant as ever, with new celebrities entering by the day, but the platform’s currency gives cause for concern. When she can’t sleep at night, she finds herself refreshing price charts. IVRS is all over the place, sometimes falling 20% to 30% in a day before bouncing back up. Once it’s driven down by a minor hack, another time it’s a U.S. government regulator calling the metaverse a “bubble.” Most alarming, sometimes the price drops for no reason at all.  ***  One early evening, under a rose-gold watercolor sky, the barista reappears. She can see him standing on her porch. He knocks on the door, but she doesn’t answer. She is still upset about the ad and his weeks of ignoring her. She knows he’s been having a hard time too, but at that moment she doesn’t really care. How could he leave her alone in this crazy world? Since she won’t open the door to talk to him, a chat bubble appears above his head.  “I need to talk to you,” the text says. “Please.” She is tempted to ignore him, but his body language has an unusual sense of urgency. He is pacing back and forth very fast on her porch. She reluctantly sends a message back.  “What is it?”  “Meet me on the outside, at the old cafe. I’m already in your neighborhood.”  “Can’t we just talk here? I have a new product line dropping tomorrow.”  “No,” he says. “We can’t. Meet me on the outside.” Then he vanishes. He has logged off.  It is a strange request. He quit his job as a barista ages ago, why does he want to meet at that cafe? She can’t remember the last time she saw a coffee that was actually drinkable. She starts to wonder if something is seriously wrong. She logs off and goes outside, blinking in the sunlight. Somewhere in all of this summer has arrived.  He is already at the cafe, sitting at one of the outside tables. He bears no resemblance to the sharply dressed DJ waving to a sea of fans. There are dark circles under eyes, his skin is so pale it is almost translucent, and he is wearing ill-fitting sweatpants and a stained white t-shirt. He barely makes eye contact.  ""Listen,"" he says, ""I shouldn’t be telling you this. No one knows. The founding team is a mess. The CEO has like three other projects and one of them is about to be investigated for fraud. Get out now. Do it today.""  He stands up. ""I have to go,"" he says and starts walking.  “Hey,” she calls after him, like she does at his shows. But this time he stops and turns around, if just for a moment.  “Thank you,” she says.  ***  She goes home and puts her house on the market. It sells immediately. IVRS is way down off its peak, but the house still sells for exponentially more than the purchase price, when Iro was a ghost town. As soon as the coins land in her wallet, she converts them into dollars.  Three days later she signs a one-year lease for a new apartment. It’s still far from home ownership but the apartment is clean and bright, and there are no roommates, no cat, just her.  Two days after that, Iro’s CEO is arrested in California. The price of IVRS crashes by 80%.  She’s relieved that she got out in time. But she knows that she’ll never make it in this city, and also that she doesn’t have to try. There will always be another game.  She texts the barista: “So where’s the next world?”  He sends her a map.

42421571,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoePl,1653513463,The New Ways of Making Money in the Metaverse,"Editor's note: As part of CoinDesk’s “Metaverse Week,” we asked a number of engineers, executives and experts to weigh in on the substantial issues raised by the crypto industry. In this roundtable discussion, they answer the question of how the metaverse will be integrated into the internet as we know it, and how that changes its economic incentives.  Answers touch on discussing the new business models that may emerge as well as how to make classic internet advertising more “tasteful.” Also, considering the time we already spend online, how might the metaverse change how we socialize, and what are the technical issues we may have to bear in mind?  This article is part of ""Metaverse Week.""  An open metaverse preempts bad business models  Here's a simple truth: The decentralized web, or Web 3, will exponentially grow during this decade – but it won't be until the next one that it will have an actual impact. Web 3 can genuinely change the identity, utility and equitable monetization models of the internet as we know it. When that day comes, the internet will mainly run through decentralized nodes and flex the potential of token economies.  In contrast, the archaic and centralized internet (Web 2) will remain controlled and manipulated by enterprises, tech billionaires and nation-states. Likely, the tech giants of today will integrate CBDCs [central bank digital currencies] and easily surveilled identity protocols over time.  See also: If Money Is Speech, CBDCs Should Be Tools for Freedom | Opinion  Only time will tell how tech will unfold, and Web 2 could also serve as a door for people and platforms to enter the open metaverse. In such a world, the historic manipulations and inequities of tech today – like business models based on exploiting free personal data of users – will be discredited and impossible to apply. Ultimately, the metaverse, and the promise of token economies, will fuel a plethora of different monetization approaches that haven't yet been possible. Let's continue learning and building.  – Irina Karagyaur, head of metaverse growth at Unique Network  Advertising done tastefully  Some traditional internet business models, like advertising, are likely to persist in the metaverse. However, with blockchain-adjacent technologies such as decentralized identity and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), one’s privacy can actually be preserved in the metaverse, if we construct the foundations just right. Nonetheless, leveraging these kinds of privacy and identity technologies, especially ZKPs, may come with the additional hurdle of poorer latency [because] the zero-knowledge proof itself can be computationally expensive to perform.  On the internet, recommendation engines are in real time, matching the viewer to the most relevant ad slot at a sub-second rate. Because ZKPs can add latency into the several seconds or minutes, companies will have to find clever solutions. In a decentralized metaverse, recommendation engines (which are not exclusively utilized for ads, I might point out, but also for pointing users towards new experiences, events or people) will actually compute recommendations while you’re out of view of the virtual banner in the geospatial environment or offline completely.  The result of this can be thoughtful recommendations for product, services or experiences that are catered to the individual, while preserving privacy rights and also, if ever requested, full transparency into why and how this recommendation engine decided to show me what it did. I believe these kinds of experiences are likely to emerge in the metaverse. While we may still rely on tried and tested business models of “yesteryear’s internet” to generate value for the infrastructure providers, we can do it with more class and taste.  – Joshua Tobkin, CEO of SupraOracles  Metaverse, meet DeFi  The metaverse is becoming one of the many places where people’s digital and IRL (in real life) identities are intersecting. As more social, gaming and financial organizations recognize the unique connection they can establish with their users via the metaverse, they will begin to shift into the metaverse, bringing their products and services there.  For decentralized finance, an industry that removes gatekeepers from economic tools, this will result in the creation of ways for users to transact with their crypto in the metaverse. This could potentially include sending tokens to friends, interacting with staking pools and more. Much of the excitement lies in what is possible, but hasn’t been done yet.  – Ryan Berkun, founder and CEO of Teller Finance  Finding your tribe  It’s human nature to long for community and connection. We form groups based on similar values, interests and experiences. The metaverse is just a new expression of our identity and will reflect the things people care about and want to associate with. There will be many metaverses that serve specific affinities.  Individuals will be able to transverse from one metaverse to another and bring with them their identity and assets (financial, data or otherwise). Sports lovers will be able to play games and share experiences with like-minded fans. Music aficionados will be able to discover and interact with emerging artists in a way not previously possible due to dispersed fan groups that made it hard to come together IRL. Fashion brands will be able to preview collections, gather feedback on new products and sell their wares in a personal way no longer limited by their geographic store footprint.  In many ways the internet has allowed each of us to “find our tribe” or the group of like-minded individuals who share the same values and interests. This creates a sense of belonging and feelings of being understood, which can be hugely beneficial to one's sense of self. It can also result in societal fractures and dangerous echo chambers if exposure to new ideas and ways of being is done away with entirely. We will need thoughtful innovation on how to solve for both connection and cross-pollination to ensure the health of our societies going forward.  – Tara Fung, co-founder of Co:Create and CEO of Gesso Labs  A public good  In a way, we have all already been living in the first iteration of the metaverse since the start of the [coronavirus] pandemic. Living on Zoom calls, establishing personal relationships with people that we have never met before and the normalization of being online exemplifies how embedded the “real” metaverse will be in our daily lives. Because the metaverse will act as a utility, in contrast to what’s being marketed by Facebook/Meta [FB], the metaverse will be categorized as a public good, just like access to the internet.  See also: Is 'Meta' Already Giving Up on the Metaverse? | Opinion  As is the case with using the internet, there will be vast benefits to be had but certain dangers that must be taken into consideration. This underscores the importance of having tools readily available that help users protect their privacy, improve security and resilience and remove the barriers of an antiquated username-password authentication process for a safe and user-friendly experience.  – John Jefferies, chief marketing officer of Blocknative  Interconnected, composable, collaborative  The term ""metaverse"" was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 sci-fi novel, ""Snow Crash."" The book frames the metaverse as an immersive successor to the internet, one that’s not so different from the Oculus-connected version we know today. It explores anarcho-capitalist themes, where people eschew the U.S. dollar in favor of less regulated “electronic currencies,” and nation-states are “decentralized” and replaced by private agencies.  When Facebook rebranded to Meta last October, it was hard not to invoke some of Stephenson’s dystopian themes. Meta’s embrace of the metaverse is a clear indication of its future plans: to build an immersive, high-fidelity extension of the current web – i.e. a platform that’s shepherded and maintained by a few giant companies, fueled by ad-funded models for content and gaming and underpinned by Facebook’s existing social graph.  In contrast with Meta’s centrally-controlled metaverse, builders around the world are working together to develop the foundations of an alternative ecosystem: the hyperverse. Alternatively referred to as Web 3, the hyperverse is a progressively-decentralized web as well as an interconnected, composable, collaborative internet. It is a nonlinear digital space. It includes multimedia, community and financial protocols, and is underpinned by blockchain technology that acts as a permanent and permissionless shared infrastructure layer.  This movement represents a reconstruction of online power dynamics, one that redistributes ownership across a web of interconnected technology, media, and protocols. It has applications from audio, video, stories, art and games to tokenized incentive systems or programmable money.  New organizing models like DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) are emerging to support this evolution, realigning platform incentives toward building collective value. The goal is to re-open the internet using collaborative economics – through a mix of traditional entities paired with DAOs, through traditional incentives paired with tokenized models and through traditional technology paired with blockchain-enabled systems.  – Timshel, a core contributor to BitDAO  More from Metaverse Week:  How the Metaverse Could Be a Game-Changer for NFT Gaming  Rather than letting players port weapons or powers between games, non-fungible tokens will more likely serve as building blocks for new games and virtual worlds.

The country’s Senate in December had already passed similar legislation, and the bill will now return to that body with the Chamber of Deputies’ modifications. Once the Senate approves the changes, the pending law would move to the executive branch, which hasn’t yet signaled whether it will sign or veto.  Speaking with CoinDesk last year, Carlos Rejala – one of the bill’s authors – said the legislation aims to attract international miners to Paraguay, which has one of the lowest electricity rates in Latin America at around 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  If the bill becomes law, individual and corporate miners will have to request authorization for industrial electricity consumption and then apply for a license. The proposal also creates a registry for any individual or legal entity aiming to provide crypto trading or custody services for third parties, although the concept of exchange is not included.  In the debate, Congressman Tadeo Rojas (ANR-Central) argued against the legislation, noting that the Chamber of Deputies’ budget committee recommended rejection. He added the impact on job creation is low compared with the energy consumption required by mining companies.  In favor of the proposal, Congressman Sebastián García (PPQ-Capital) said the bill sets ceilings so that energy consumption is in line with availability.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/25/paraguayan-bill-regulating-crypto-mining-and-trading-moves-closer-to-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aab93cd52590c5e0694db2f42a1bf86a88a1dc9b-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The chart below shows the recent rise in open interest, or the number of outstanding contracts, in the bitcoin perpetual futures market. ""Rapid surges in open interest tend to foreshadow large moves in the market,"" Arcane Research wrote in a report this week.  For example, a similar rise in open interest occurred shortly before a short squeeze in July of last year when BTC was trading around $30,000. But a rise in open interest also coincided with BTC's price peak of around $48,000 in March, and remained elevated during subsequent sell-offs in price, according to Arcane.  Speculative unwind  With so much uncertainty, traders have been unwilling to express a strong bullish or bearish bias. For example, funding rates, or the cost to fund long and short positions in the perpetual futures market, have been moved between neutral and negative over the past few months. That means traders holding short positions have been dominant in the market, willing to pay long traders to express a bearish view.  Still, funding rates have not been deeply negative in a while, which typically occurs around price bottoms. Likewise, extreme rises in funding rates have typically occurred around price peaks. That suggests the excess speculative activity that defined the 2020-2021 bull market has receded.  Altcoin roundup  Terra 2.0 and LUNA airdrop incoming: Revival plans for the Terra blockchain are taking shape two weeks after the network’s stablecoin (UST) and its native token (LUNA) fell to nearly zero. There has been a heated debate about what's next for Terra, with the community being divided. The conclusion is a launch of a parallel “Terra 2.0” later this week, with a plan to compensate LUNA holders gradually over time to mitigate selling pressure. Validators, which run the blockchain and stake LUNA by managing staking pools, approved the revival plans, much to the dismay of the Terra community’s majority, including one of the largest decentralized finance platforms, Lido, voting against supporting the new Terra blockchain.

Data by CoinMetrics shows that crypto whales – addresses that hold more than $1 million – on the Ethereum blockchain left Tether’s USDT for the perceived safety of its biggest competitor, USDC. Since Terra’s collapse, USDT saw $10 billion in redemptions. It’s still the most popular stablecoin – cryptocurrencies with a price pegged to another asset, usually to the U.S. dollar – but USDC gained about $5 billion, eating into USDT’s market share.

Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, said in a comment letter to the Fed that its token is already meeting “many of the potential benefits” of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the U.S.  “A host of companies, including Circle, have leveraged blockchain technology to support trillions of dollars of economic activity with fiat-referenced stablecoins,” the company told the Fed in a letter released Wednesday, responding to the Fed’s invitation to comment on a January report. “The introduction of a CBDC by the Federal Reserve could have a chilling effect on new innovations.”  The stablecoin industry has been suffering collateral damage recently from the ugly collapse of terraUSD (UST), although that was an algorithmic stablecoin, not one backed by reserves. Boston-based Circle made a case to the Fed that its USDC stablecoin – which ranks second by global market cap – is backed by “cash and short-duration U.S. government obligations” and the company assures the public regularly with attestations about the content of those reserves.  “USDC does not detract from, but in fact supports, the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency,” the company argued.  Circle also underlined potential harms a digital dollar might pose to traditional banking, which the banking industry itself pointed out in its own letters. The stablecoin issuer left the Fed with a remark that’s a common refrain among technology-intensive industries:  “It could be challenging for the Federal Reserve to issue a CBDC on a technology standard that does not quickly become obsolete, given the pace of technological advancements,” Circle argued in its letter.

Nakamoto revealed to his 1.5 million followers on Twitter how luna 2.0 will demonstrate to the world exactly how truly dumb crypto gamblers actually are.

Bitcoin Trading Volume Falls Back Down To Values Around $4 Billion As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the Bitcoin trading volume has plummeted back down after the recent high values. The &apos;daily spot trading volume&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin moving on the chain on any given day. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the number of coins changing hands on the network is increasing. Such a trend can be a sign that interest around the crypto among investors is rising right now. On the other hand, a downtrend in the volume would suggest that market activity is going down. This trend may imply that the general interest around the crypto could be diminishing. Historically, high values of the indicator have provided for a favorable environment to push large moves in the price of Bitcoin.

42421575,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeUv,1653502463,Will Reality Have Its Revenge on Andreessen Horowitz's Giant New Crypto Fund?,"We are in the midst of a brutal downturn in equity markets, in large part because inflation has pushed the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten interest rates. The impacts have been particularly sharp for “growth” or “innovation” assets, including predominantly technology-focused equities such as Tesla (TSLA), which is down a brutal 42% since early April. Tesla is also representative of many such entities’ reliance on an ambitious, even hyperbolic, narrative delivered by a charismatic figurehead.  Yet, in the midst of all of this, the venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is making huge new bets on swing-for-the-fences innovation and charisma-driven narratives, this time in cryptocurrency and blockchain.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On Tuesday it was reported that a16z led a $70 million funding round for a new startup from disgraced former WeWork (WE) founder and CEO Adam Neumann. The project is a blockchain service called Flowcarbon, which will purportedly sell, trade and track carbon credits. This morning, a16z also announced a new $4.5 billion crypto and blockchain investment fund.  This funding round feels like news from an entirely different era. In fact, it’s quite likely the raise was well underway before economic conditions got as bad as they are now. Because while Neumann has proven extremely good at generating hype and press, he has never really delivered the only thing that will matter now that interest rates are ticking up: actual net revenue, aka that long-forgotten performance metric known as “profit.”  As a brief review, Neumann started a company called WeWork in 2010, taking advantage of a post-Great Recession real estate downturn to enter long-term leases on office space and then sublet small units to startups and contractors. Many observers pointed out that this model was fraught with risk and might not make sense in the long term.  Those skeptics were vindicated in 2019 when WeWork attempted to go public: Both the broad financials and details of the WeWork operation were so damning the IPO (initial public offering) was canceled and Neumann was pushed out as CEO. Investors lost billions in paper value, making for one of the most catastrophic business failures of the past decade.

The common thread here is these are money-losing or barely profitable operations focused on building things that might make money in the future. For most of a decade, such companies have been able to stay afloat because borrowing was very cheap and there were few better options for investors. But as safe investments start generating even marginally higher returns, borrowing will become harder, more expensive and impossible for the least profitable growth companies.  Of course, it’s not all about cheap money. To get people to keep loaning you capital you have to tell them a compelling story about what you’re going to do with it. This, for instance, has been the key to success for Tesla stock, with CEO Elon Musk’s cult of personality helping drive the stock’s price-to-earnings ratio as high as 688-to-1, according to Ycharts. A stock with a P/E ratio of 20-to-1 is generally considered expensive.  Neumann’s Flowcarbon falls squarely in the “speculative bets” bucket. A blockchain service for tracking carbon credits is not an entirely meritless idea. It seems reasonable to think that more countries may implement or expand carbon credit systems over the next decade or two, and at least superficially it’s the sort of transnational problem where a trustless blockchain could actually be useful. But there are a lot of unknowns along the path to that future – and even if it happens, Flowcarbon will have competition from similar projects like KlimaDAO.  So it seems likely that Neumann himself was central to the fundraise, which also includes an ongoing private token sale. But why is that, if he’s such a notorious screwup as a startup leader and has zero experience relevant to blockchain? One thing to remember is that a good portion of the Flowcarbon funding was likely negotiated before the extent of the ongoing meltdown in equity markets was quite clear. Backers may have thought they were still playing by the rules of the 2010-2021 market, when a charismatic face like Neumann’s was enough to drive an upbeat narrative and gas up asset prices.  But that might not be true anymore as real profits rapidly become the main priority for many investors, both in crypto and equities. That’s a crucial consideration as a16z prepares to deploy its new $4.5 billion crypto venture fund because so few crypto companies or protocols can rightly be considered “profitable.” In fact, because they effectively print their own internal scrip, it can be very difficult to even determine what actual “profit” is for a blockchain project.  See also: Bitcoin Is Far More Than a New Form of Money | Opinion  Tezos co-founder Arthur Breitman pinpointed this issue on a recent episode of Bloomberg’s ""Odd Lots"" podcast, using the metaphor of a small town. Many blockchains, he suggested, are like towns that have lots of internal economic activity, such as restaurants to serve locals (aka ecosystem users). But, Breitman argued, what really matters is whether a chain or service has external demand for its services from people or entities who don’t already “live” there – what in the “town” metaphor would be considered “exports.”  There’s a much longer conversation to be had, then, about what exactly constitutes a blockchain “export.” Big blocks of tokens sold to speculators certainly shouldn’t count, though some blockchain entities do treat those sales as conventional revenue. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are the most straightforward example of an export, at least when they’re being bought for personal collecting instead of speculation.  But one thing is clear: Crypto operations won’t be able to skate by on printing their own money for much longer. They’ll have to figure out how to actually earn some – and it’s not clear that’s in Adam Neumann’s wheelhouse – or, for that matter, a16z’s.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,David Z.

42421569,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeNh,1653499907,'Does Radio Ring a Bell?': How the Metaverse Will Change Society,"The year is 1995. It’s 11:35 p.m. and the “Late Show with David Letterman” is airing across the nation. Tonight’s guest? A still-young CEO of Microsoft (MSFT), one Bill Gates, a few years ahead of the antitrust woes he was soon to weather. Tonight’s subject? The internet.  Letterman kicks things off. “What about this internet thing … What the hell is that exactly?” A brief pause, the audience bursts into laughter. Young Bill puts on a brave if somewhat bemused face. It’s certainly not his first time explaining the importance of technology to an unyielding audience.  Winston Robson is the co-founder of WeMeta. This article is part of ""Metaverse Week.""  “It’s become a place where people can publish information,” Bill enthusiastically replies. “It’s wild what’s going on!” Letterman, unfazed, continues to push. “I heard that on the internet or on some … computer … they were going to broadcast a baseball game.”  Letterman pauses for effect. “And I just thought to myself … Does radio ring a bell?”  The audience bursts into laughter.  In 1995, the internet – an aspect of our lives now so critical that in 2016 the United Nations General Assembly declared access to it is a human right – was a joke. History is littered with similar stories.  See also: 'We Blew It.' Douglas Rushkoff's Take on the Future of the Web  The electric lightbulb was “unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific men.” The telephone was “hardly more than a toy.” And television – “people will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.” In 2010, astronaut Neil Armstrong testified before Congress that privatized space travel would cost the U.S. its status as a space pioneer.  And yet, even if met with dogma or incredulity, innovation is rarely curtailed. The truth gets out. And so too will this happen with the metaverse, the latest technology declared dead on arrival.  The metaverse  Similar to the internet in 1995, the metaverse has recently entered a breakout stage of functionality. The metaverse is a way to unlock the freedom of embodied experience online, transcending the constraints of our physical lives. One way to think of it is like living social media.  Imagine, it’s 1:00 p.m. on Dec. 31, 2021, you’re in downtown Brooklyn, N.Y., and your partner’s flight from London got canceled. The NYE Ball Drop is in 11 hours, and you were hoping to catch a glimpse of it. Barriers to entry are high, even if you’re riding solo. To watch live at One Times Square, you’ll need to catch the 7 subway train into Manhattan, have acquired one of the limited tickets, socially distance, dress warm, etc.  Or, you could simply log into Decentraland, and experience it live in the metaverse with her. Tens of thousands of people did, in fact, just this last New Year's Eve. That’s nearly as many as showed up IRL under coronavirus considerations. Soon, you will even be able to order food as apps like Uber Eats or DoorDash enter the metaverse. Sounds a lot better than Twitter to me.  After the fireworks, you’re still keen to hang. Well, sports are another aspect of connection the metaverse hooks up. Think back to Wii Sports. Tennis was fun but the game got too easy, movement was limited, the cognitive dissonance was high and my mom was always terrified the remote would slip from my hand and crash into her vase.  Now, with a virtual reality headset, you can hop into Somnium Space, a leading VR city of the metaverse, and be immersed in a 4K digital reality. With the suit, your full body movement is reflected in the game. Let’s play Wimbledon?  Kayaking, car racing, paintball and pole dancing are a few of the go-tos for Somnium; as the tech develops, linking up with your crew or new friends for a game of basketball or baseball will be as simple as logging in, no matter where you are.  Past live environments, spaces in time, like conferences or public announcements, can be digitized and preserved through the metaverse, meaning they can be re-lived by anyone in the future. IRLArt did this for ETHDenver 2022, and you can forever go back to the conference’s key attraction, the Sports Castle – artwork, booths, artifacts and all.  More than events, e-commerce is rising to new levels in the metaverse. Similar to Web 2, for both big brands and mom and pop, there’s a lower cost to provide goods and services than physical real estate. In the metaverse, however, the social excitement of shopping with friends, family and other people takes things to the next level.  At Samsung 837X, for instance, players can transpose into a spectacular light show, and see their purchases rendered 3D instead of scrolling a flat page. Fashion Week in Decentraland, another example, saw participation from names like Vogue and Forever 21.  See also: The Clumsy Theatrics of Metaverse Fashion Week  Fourteen years ago, when I created my Roblox account, I found a community. We’d play social games with sub–economies like Plane Wars or Divide & Conquer. In both of these, players earn digital currency for completing tasks, defeating an opponent or farming resources, and then use that money to invest and develop their own empires. It’s similar to Civilization or Grand Theft Auto, but with entirely player generated content. Some of my best friends and I spent hours, days even, trying to develop similar experiences in hopes of making the main page of roblox.com.  Years later, big brands are lusting to do the same.  Society makes connections, technology creates new landscapes for these connections. It started in person, went to letters, then newspapers, the telephone, the internet and now it's the metaverse.  Right now, the metaverse seems simple, more of a cartoon. However, engines like Unity and Unreal are improving immersion everyday. Soon, social engagement and shopping will default to decentraland.com/zara instead of zara.com, I believe.

42374639,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1d2t,1653498024,Jae Kwon Returns to ‘NewTendermint’ to Battle for the Soul of Cosmos,"Hot off a splashy February rebrand, Ignite (formerly Tendermint), the company originally behind the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem, has announced that it is splitting into two entities: Ignite and NewTendermint.  With the split, Ignite’s original co-founder, Jae Kwon, is rejoining his old team as the CEO of NewTendermint. Ignite’s current CEO, Peng Zhong, will stay on as CEO of the newly reconstituted Ignite.  Kwon co-founded Ignite (then called Tendermint) in 2014, but he stepped down as the company’s CEO in 2020 to focus on Gno.Land, his competitor to Ethereum. CoinDesk reported at the time that Kwon’s exit also came after several high-ranking employees left the company in protest of his leadership.  Kwon’s return to NewTendermint comes as the controversial founder has continued to feud with his former Tendermint colleagues. According to Kwon, they are “intentionally socially engineering” the failure of Cosmos and are conspiring to push him out of the ecosystem altogether.  NewTendermint’s new mission  According to a statement from Ignite and NewTendermint, the two companies will “hold complete independence from each other, with their own team, equity and funds.” All In Bits Inc., Ignite's parent company (in which Kwon holds a majority share), will only hold a minority stake in Ignite under the new deal.  Ignite, according to the statement, will “continue on the growth path positioned since the official rebranding,” which renamed the company from “Tendermint” in early 2022. This means Ignite will continue to focus on the development of Ignite’s flagship products: the Emeris portfolio manager and the Ignite CLI developer toolkit.  Kwon’s NewTendermint will focus on the development of core blockchain infrastructure. In addition to contributing to the development of Tendermint Core and the Cosmos SDK – tools for building Cosmos blockchains – NewTendermint will focus on the development of Kwon’s new Gno.Land smart contracting platform.  “I see a lack of cohesive vision that’s centered around like, ‘Let’s keep the [Cosmos Hub] minimal, let’s finish Tendermint [Core] according to the original vision, and let’s also explore a better smart contracting platform,’” Kwon told CoinDesk. “These are all part of core infrastructure still. So that’s what it is. It’s focusing back on core engineering.”  Zhong told CoinDesk that Kwon had always planned to return to Ignite in some form.  “Jae has been in communication with us about this project for over six months now,” Zhong said. “It’s always been the plan that a portion of the treasury will be maintained by Jae for him to focus on the launch of the Gno protocol, his new version of Tendermint [Core], et cetera.”  Cosmos and Gno.Land  Cosmos is a family of blockchains that are purpose-built to operate with one another. The ecosystem, which started with the Cosmos Hub (ATOM) blockchain, has grown to include a list of big-name chains, including Binance’s BNB Chain, Osmosis and the ill-fated Terra blockchain (which was at the center of a $40 billion token crash earlier this month).  Each Cosmos blockchain is built using the Cosmos SDK and the Tendermint Core consensus engine – tools first developed by Ignite designed to make it easy to get a blockchain up and running.  Kwon says his censorship-resistant Gno.Land smart contract platform will be built using Tendermint 2, an improved version of the consensus engine he launched to power Cosmos.  The broader backdrop  Kwon’s return to Ignite/NewTendermint comes as he claims his former colleagues are conspiring against him – and the network.  Kwon co-founded Tendermint and created Cosmos with Ethan Buchman in 2014, though Kwon’s relationship with Buchman and much of Tendermint’s early team soured around 2020. It was around this time Kwon’s behavior, according to some early employees, spurred an exodus of several Tendermint staffers – many of whom have continued to contribute to the network through other projects.  When Kwon’s No. 2 at Tendermint, Zaki Manian, resigned from the company he wrote a (now-deleted) Twitter thread stating that “Jae has subjected every internal communication channel to religious discrimination, loyalty tests and abusive rants.”  To this day, Kwon contends that Manian, Buchman and other Cosmos community leaders are secretly plotting against the network – potentially as part of a broader conspiracy.  While Ignite’s Zhong conceded to CoinDesk that Kwon is “not the easiest work with” he praised the incoming NewTendermint CEO as a “brilliant leader.”  “He has very strong opinions. But, you know, opinions, in other words, is a strong vision. So if you believe in Jae, he’s gonna lead you very far. And as the creator of the Cosmos ecosystem, he’s made something of massive impact,” said Zhong.  Battle for the soul of Cosmos  Kwon’s battle with his former colleagues came to a head this month with “Proposal 69,” a Cosmos Hub upgrade proposal which, according to Kwon, threatened to open up the network to security vulnerabilities. (The Cosmos Hub, similar to other Cosmos-based blockchains, allows users to vote on upgrades to the network using the Hub’s native ATOM token.)  Kwon says the proposal, which ultimately failed, was supported by the Interchain Foundation (ICF), an organization responsible for Cosmos ecosystem development that used to be helmed by Kwon himself. (The ICF and Tendermint both received 10% of the Cosmos Hub’s initial ATOM token distribution.)  A spokesperson for the ICF disputed this characterization, saying that the ICF did not take a position on the proposal. Moreover, the ICF's current president, Ethan Buchman, voted against it.  Proposal 69 was, however, publicly backed by Kwon’s former Tendermint colleagues – and chief Cosmos adversaries – Manian and Jack Zampolin.  As an incentive for users to vote against the proposal, Kwon said he would add “no” voters to the Gno.Land token airdrop.  UPDATE (May 26, 16:40 UTC): The fifth paragraph has been changed to clarify the new relationship between All in Bits, Inc. and Ignite (based on an update from an Ignite spokesperson). Paragraphs 21 and 22 have also been corrected to reflect that the Interchain Foundation (ICF) did not take a formal stance on Proposition 69.",NEUTRAL,ATOM | BNB,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | BNB | AIRDROP,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/25/jae-kwon-returns-to-newtendermint-to-battle-for-the-soul-of-cosmos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3f07dfe5462384eda4d3a7c458589f3a40955a3-2048x1269.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This has been one in the making ever since the Terra crash had begun and investors had scrambled to leave the market. A culmination of this and speculations that the market is headed into one of the longest bear trends ever recorded has now seen sentiment fall to levels not recorded since 2020. In The Extreme Fear Region Now, the crypto market sentiment has not been positive for a while. Most of the last two months have been spent in the fear territory and April had closed out in extreme fear. Nevertheless, the scores on the Fear &amp; Greed Index had remained somewhat high until the LUNA crash. This has sent the market into extreme fear overdrive as the Fear &amp; Greed Index now displays a score of 12, the lowest it has been in two years.

42374649,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1dED,1653497236,Crypto Whales Ditched Tether for USDC After Stablecoin Panic,"There has been a change in the thinking of the large crypto investors known as whales. Data shows USD coin (USDC) has become the stablecoin of choice on the Ethereum blockchain, not the larger tether (USDT).  In crypto, whales are the biggest cryptocurrency holders – institutional investors, exchanges, deep-pocketed individuals – who are capable of moving large amounts of tokens and swaying market prices. Analysts closely watch their activity to spot trends and anticipate large price movements.  Data from CoinMetrics, a blockchain analysis firm, shows wallet addresses on the Ethereum blockchain that hold more than $1 million USDC surpassed the number of wallets that hold USDT, still the largest stablecoin by market cap.  “In the current market condition, a lot of people view USDC as the safer, preferred stablecoin,"" Edward Moya, trading platform Oanda’s senior market analyst, told CoinDesk.  USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, has been gaining market share since the once-$18 billion UST stablecoin collapsed and USDT’s peg to the dollar wobbled.  CoinMetrics looked at blockchain data since May 9, when UST lost its peg to the U.S. dollar. The firm identified 147 Ethereum wallet addresses that increased their USDC balance by at least $1 million while decreasing their USDT balance by at least $1 million. Among them, there were 23 that added at least $10 million USDC and disposed of $10 million USDT. Many of these addresses are exchanges, custodial services or decentralized finance protocols, the report added.  The report also said USDC’s advantage over Tether's USDT in so-called free float supply – the number of tokens that investors hold – on the Ethereum blockchain hit an all-time high on Tuesday among all holder groups.  ""This likely reflects the fact that only large holders are generally privileged to redeem USDT and mint new USDC to capture an arbitrage,"" Kyle Waters, analyst at CoinMetrics, wrote in the report. ""But it might also be the case that some large accounts are de-risking their holdings, turning to the perceived assurances of USDC’s monthly attestations and full-reserve backing.""  Tether, the company behind USDT, reduced its commercial paper holdings by 17% from $24.2 billion to $20.1 billion in the first quarter, according to its latest, quarterly, attestation report of the assets backing the stablecoin. However, it also said $286 million of its assets were being held in non-U.S. Treasury bonds with a maturity of less than 180 days.  USDT has suffered $10 billion in redemptions overall since the UST failure, which shook investors' trust in the stability of stablecoins in general. Redemptions pushed down the overall circulating supply of USDT to $73 billion from $83 billion in 10 days. In the same period, USDC’s supply rose to $53 billion from $48 billion.  Amid the flurry of events as UST's worth dropped to nearly zero within days, USDT briefly lost its peg to the dollar. Even though its price quickly recovered to $1, the wobble renewed uncertainty about what assets back the value of USDT.  Most decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions take place on the Ethereum blockchain, and USDC has been the stablecoin of choice in DeFi.  For example, DAI, the largest decentralized and overcollateralized stablecoin, is holding USDC instead of USDT in its treasury. DAI, the currency of the blockchain protocol MakerDAO, has a market capitalization of more than $6 billion and keeps its 1:1 exchange ratio to the U.S. dollar by amassing much more crypto assets than the market value of all the DAI tokens in circulation.",NEUTRAL,USDT | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | USDT | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/25/crypto-whales-ditched-tether-for-usdc-after-stablecoin-panic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a688a3ec29ecaaa63dc7f4da82bc03602e95fa2-1200x709.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374632,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1csp,1653496329,FTX’s Bankman-Fried Pitches CFTC on Directly Clearing Customers’ Crypto Swaps,"FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried faced a roomful of derivatives industry giants and regulators in Washington on Wednesday to argue for his company’s proposal to directly clear transactions. He also neatly illustrated the potential divide between the two sides by tweeting comments while the discussion was underway.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) hosted the discussion about the possibility of cutting out industry middlemen in an overhaul of derivatives trading first sought by FTX’s U.S. derivatives operation. While the CFTC weighs the company’s application, it invited industry players and academics to debate the topic in the large room at its Washington offices where the agency has often held talks over industry developments. After several hours, Bankman-Fried couldn’t resist dressing down those criticizing his company’s idea.  “There is some irony in some of the statements made by people attempting to protect those who know massively more than they do about the topic and who understand these products extremely well,” Bankman-Fried said late in the day. He further accused critics of the FTX proposal of “condescendingly” talking about protecting users who he maintained know much more than many of the experts the CFTC invited.  “I just had to get that off my chest a little bit,” he said, adding that consumer protection is “extremely important.”  Earlier in the day, Bankman-Fried had said “a lot of things that I think are pretty wrong that have been said, and a lot of things that are pretty helpful, and I really appreciate the latter."" The basic idea -- known as “non-intermediated clearing” -- is that his company is seeking the ability to clear his customers’ margin-backed derivatives contracts directly without traditional intermediaries, with Bankman-Fried often touting its benefits for handling market stress as it happens.  During the discussion, the existing industry structure was defended as “quite adaptive” against volatile situations by Sean Downey, executive director for clearing, risk and capital policy at CME Group, the world’s leading derivatives exchange. Downey also criticized any new system that would lean on algorithms over capital cushions, arguing that the former brings its own hazards. “We’ve seen that movie before, and in fact, we saw it very recently,” he said, referring to the recent meltdown of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST).  Several of the derivatives industry representatives also highlighted their worries about the use of automatic liquidations to respond to real-time market stresses, as envisioned in the FTX.US application to the CFTC.  Gerry Corcoran, CEO of R.J. O’Brien & Associates, called the use of such liquidations a “weapon of mass destruction” that “will create a cycle of flash crashes” without the human interventions common in today’s market that could limit dramatic swings that computers might allow.  For his part, Bankman-Fried responded to dozens of points on Twitter as the discussion stretched over hours. He returned to the debate in the room to defend his views on handling customers’ positions on a live basis, which his company has already been doing in other countries.  ""Being able to have that real-time measurement of collateral and position size in real time action allows you to not deleverage a customer position until it actually is necessary, while still being able to do so prior to creating systemic risk,"" he said. ""There are pros and cons, but I think there are a lot of advantages.""  Read more: FTX's Bankman-Fried Is Already a Political Mega-Donor.

Binance will also try to ""integrate banking infrastructure within the cryptocurrency market,"" and help with the country's blockchain strategy, according to a post on its official blog.  It will work with the country's digital ministry to make IT park Astana Hub into a regional blockchain hub, the post said.  Kazakhstan is one of the world's biggest bitcoin mining powerhouses, but its mining industry has been struggling to deal with electricity shortages. The government has turned to developing its crypto and blockchain industry beyond mining, including attracting new firms to its finance hub, the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC).  The central bank also confirmed to CoinDesk a March amendment to a law that allows banks to service crypto exchanges established in the AIFC.  The advisory role is a turnaround for Binance, which last year drew ire from regulators around the world. The company has since been beefing up its compliance team and efforts to assuage their concerns.  Binance founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao met Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, as well as Minister of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry Bagdat Musin and the president's First Deputy Chief of Staff Timur Suleimenov on Wednesday, according to the post.  ""Together with CZ, we considered the Binance roadmap in Kazakhstan.

Due to the rapid emergence and evolution of cryptocurrencies, the traditional hedge fund industry has become the ideal entry point for investors. Large, influential funds have started to see Bitcoin as a relatively small-quantity asset and have begun taking advantage of its demand. Despite the crypto community&apos;s widespread criticism and dismaying statements, returns from these funds have been impressive. However, long-term crypto investors should think twice before investing in crypto hedge funds. Here&apos;s why: Hedge Funds Lack Transparency A hedge fund can be very appealing to individuals looking for higher returns. However, it can also become riskier for investors with less regulation due to the lack of transparency. Also, with less transparency, investors can be left with the impression that the funds are in proper use, which is not always the case. In recent years, there have been several cases where hedge fund managers have been accused of using their clients&apos; money for various non-investments. Mostly, the clients do not receive their money when the cryptocurrency trading rules do not go as planned.

42417138,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3av,1653492292,Why Is South Korea Throwing Money at the Metaverse?,"South Korea has emerged as a global technology powerhouse in recent decades, giving rise to industry giants like Samsung, LG and Hyundai. If the country’s government gets its way, a metaverse company could be the next big thing to ride the Korean wave.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week.  The Korean government made headlines earlier this year when it announced plans to pour 224 billion Korean won (nearly $200 million) into its domestic “metaverse ecosystem.” The money will be doled out in the form of grants to universities and private companies working on a variety of areas, including the construction of metaverse platforms, education and the development of virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR) and hologram technologies.  The goal? According to the Ministry of Science and ICT, the funding will help educate and train 40,000 metaverse professionals in Korea, boost over 200 companies operating in the metaverse space, and, by 2026, turn the country into the fifth-largest metaverse market by number of users.  “It is important to create a world-class expanded virtual world ecosystem as a starting point for intensively fostering the expanded virtual world,” said the ministry’s head, Park Yun-gyu, in a translated statement included in the announcement.  The funding is a key part of an ambitious new plan called the “Digital New Deal” – a nationwide initiative aimed at helping the country’s tech industry expand – that started under Korea’s previous president, Moon Jae-In. By pouring $8.7 billion into a variety of tech initiatives, from artificial intelligence to 6G to the metaverse, the country hopes to create nearly 2 million new jobs.  The Korean government’s embrace of the metaverse is somewhat unusual – though other governments, including China’s, have dipped a toe into the same virtual waters, South Korea is the only country that has jumped in headfirst.  “South Korea stands as the most aggressive and determined government in pushing the development of the metaverse,” said Nina Xiang, tech journalist and author of “Parallel Metaverses.” “Other Asian countries don’t have similar types of metaverse programs in both scale and scope as that of the South Korean government.”  Poised for success in the metaverse?  To people who saw Korea’s ascent from developing economy to economic powerhouse in a generation, the early adoption of the metaverse hasn't been surprising, said Yat Siu, the Hong Kong-based chairman of Animoca Brands – the blockchain gaming powerhouse behind The Sandbox metaverse.  Siu pointed to the country’s early adoption of broadband in the 90s. That investment spawned a dynamic internet culture and a highly tech-savvy population accustomed to online gaming and virtual entertainment, including the increasingly virtual K-pop music industry.  Read More: Metaverse Real Estate – Next Big Thing or Next Big Boondoggle?  “Korea developed its industry in a very short time after the Korean War. Koreans are accustomed to change for growth,” said Dr. Sangkyun Kim, a professor at Kyung Hee University who has written several books about the metaverse. “The Korean government and companies in the metaverse field share a consensus that they should dominate the platform and content, not just the hardware industry.”  The country’s strong domestic hardware industry – dominated by the presence of Samsung and other semiconductor manufacturers – also make South Korea’s metaverse dreams more realistic.  Manufacturing the equipment needed to access metaverse platforms, including mobile phones, computers and XR (extended reality)/VR headsets, will require a strong basis in those semiconductors, an industry South Korea thrives in. By far the country’s largest export, semiconductors accounted for nearly 17% of South Korea’s exports in 2020.  A complex political landscape  It also helps that the goal of building the metaverse has been a largely nonpartisan issue in South Korea.  “The Korean government’s investment plan for the metaverse began under the previous president. The newly inaugurated president [Yoon Suk-Yeol] announced 110 ‘national tasks,’ of which about 10 are related to the metaverse,” said Kim.  “The metaverse is a topic that both former and current presidents view as important. The Yoon government plans to revitalize the ecosystem by enacting metaverse-related laws and [developing] metaverse services that support economic activities,” Kim added.  While the metaverse may not be divisive, the country’s relationship with crypto is more complicated.  Under the former leadership of the Liberal party, South Korean financial regulators clamped down on the crypto industry, enacting sweeping regulations that decimated the country’s domestic exchanges. In 2021 alone, approximately 70 Korean exchanges were shuttered, leaving only a handful left standing.  Yoon, the current president, campaigned on promises to deregulate the crypto industry – promises that will be much more difficult to make good on in the wake of Terra’s collapse, which has sparked a slew of regulatory actions, lawsuits and investigations.  “Fair or not, Do Kwon has become an example,” Siu said. “If you know anything about Korea’s judicial system … he’s going to struggle a lot on a personal level.”  Despite the public outrage directed at Terra, Siu told CoinDesk that he has not seen a knock-on effect across the wider crypto and metaverse industries in South Korea.  “People are still positively viewing the metaverse,” Siu said.  A variety of use cases for the metaverse  The broad list of potential use cases for metaverse technology outlined by the Ministry of Science and ICT range from the mundane (like accessing municipal services in Seoul and taking language classes) to the more exciting (like virtual tourism and cultural events).  The government’s scattershot approach to metaverse development mirrors the efforts in private industry.  Last year, SK Telecom – the telecommunications arm of SK Group, Korea’s third largest family-owned conglomerate – launched Ifland, a social metaverse platform.  Read More: How to Invest in the Metaverse  In January, the famously tech-obsessed chairman of retail chaebol Lotte Group held a board meeting in the metaverse, and pledged to transform the group into a metaverse-focused retailer. Lotte plans to launch a metaverse shopping platform by the end of the summer, enabled by its earlier acquisition of Caliverse, a domestic metaverse startup, last year.  Lotte Group’s metaverse ambitions aren’t just limited to shopping: The conglomerate has also created a virtual replica of its popular Lotte World theme park in Zepeto, an internationally popular metaverse platform created by search engine giant Naver.  Klaytn, the blockchain arm of Korean messaging company Kakao, is also doubling down on its efforts to branch into the metaverse.  “Recognizing the potential of the metaverse to redefine society, Klaytn is turning its entire platform to support metaverse use cases,” said Kimberly Kok, a communications manager for Klaytn.  Kok said Klaytn is working to make it easier for game developers and metaverse builders to build on its network – and has even launched a $500 million grant program designed to provide capital to metaverse projects.  But it’s not only chaebols and tech giants splashing around in the metaverse – small startups across Korea are also experimenting with metaverse technologies, from developing metaverse co-working spaces to creating AI-enabled metaverse performers.  A bust in Busan  While government and industry alike seem enthusiastic about the metaverse, enthusiasm doesn’t always translate to success.  In 2019, the South Korean government declared Busan – a large port city in the south of the country – to be the “Blockchain City.” By relaxing some of the strict crypto regulations and setting up a sandbox for industry players to test new technologies, the government hoped to establish the country’s second-largest city as a hotbed for crypto innovation.  Despite South Korea’s efforts, however, the results have so far been underwhelming.  A report from the Busan Research Institute in 2020 – a year after the project was launched – indicated that the overwhelming majority of companies in Busan had no plans to integrate blockchain technology into their businesses – and 62% of surveyed companies said they knew nothing about it.  According to Kim, there are two main reasons that the project has yet to take off.  “First in Korea, except for Seoul and the metropolitan area, there are few places where high-tech industries are developed. Metaverse and blockchain require a lot of IT manpower, and it is not easy to supply such manpower in local cities,” Kim said.  “Second, the business models proposed by companies seeking to benefit from [the initiative] were not significantly different from the business models of existing blockchain companies,” Kim added.  However, Kim also pointed out that the current heads of the agencies in charge of the Busan “Blockchain City” initiative are elected and will soon be replaced.  “The city of Busan has not given up on this, so I’d like to see the results a little more,” Kim said.

42393823,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBbbv,1653492066,"As Bitcoin Price Slides, Older Mining Rigs Are Becoming Less Profitable","Mining a Bitcoin block just became easier because some miners have been dropping out of the network to cut their losses.  The difficulty of mining a bitcoin block fell by 4.3317% to 29.897T at 15:02 UTC on May 25. The bitcoin mining difficulty automatically adjusts every two weeks or so, depending on how much computing power, or hashrate, is securing the network, in order to keep the time required to mine a block around 10 minutes.  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  The adjustment is likely “due to a recent slow block production rate resulting from hashrate going offline due to the falling bitcoin price,” Jaran Mellerud, researcher at Oslo-based Arcane Research, told CoinDesk.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) suffered price losses over the past few weeks and older models of mining rigs have become unprofitable. So miners are powering them off to avoid shouldering the costs.  As of May 4, Bitmain’s Antminer s9 have been loss-making for miners that pay upwards of 6 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity, according to data from Luxor and f2pool.  Historically, s9s, released in 2017, have been able to survive in the market. As of the end of 2021, they accounted for one-fifth of the total hashrate, according to research from CoinShares. Some of these rigs, clocking up to 14 terahashes/second (TH/s), have been plugged in for over five years. Bitmain’s latest rigs can deliver up to 255 TH/s of computing power.  Miners that use more powerful machines can withstand difficulty adjustments. According to its May 17 newsletter, Compass Mining (CMP) calculated that Bitmain’s Antminer s19, launched in 2020, can remain profitable even if the mining difficulty doubles, provided that miners pay less than 8 cents per kWh of electricity and the price of bitcoin is over $30,000.  Given that bitcoin is currently hovering around $30,000, “the cash flow break-even price for Antminer S9s is about [five cents], which is just above the industry median of [four cents],” Mellerud said. A lot of the network is powered by S9s, and with these rigs now unprofitable, overall computing power on the Bitcoin network has dropped.  The network’s hashrate has dropped around 9% from its high of 229 EH/s to 209 EH/s in the past month.  Weathering the storm  Miners that use hardware in the same category as Bitmain s9s with energy prices over 5 cents are likely to capitulate, Denis Rusinovich, co-founder of CMG Cryptocurrency Mining Group and Maverick Group, told CoinDesk. That might entail powering off their machines or selling them. Ethan Vera, chief economist and operating officer at Luxor, which runs a trading desk for mining rigs, agreed, saying that because S9s are still selling for $150-$300 per unit, mining farms might opt to sell them,  Retail miners will be most affected by the unprofitability of these mining rigs, agreed Rusinovich, Vera and Li Qingfei, the head of research at f2pool. Retail miners often use more expensive hosting packages and have higher capital expenditure to procure hardware, Rusinovich said.  Retail miners “must constantly upgrade to latest-generation hardware in order to be protected from downturns in mining economics,” Vera said.  However, Rusinovich thinks the market downturn will also challenge some industrial-scale operations; in particular, those that have raised funds through debt, often using bitcoin and hardware as collateral, as well as younger projects that were too bullish in their assumptions, he said.  The CMG Group CEO expects “some miners with long-term purchasing contracts” to run into “cash flow issues,” especially those that didn’t go through the last few down-cycles and were consequently too relaxed in their risk assessments.  Retail miners “have a few tricks up their sleeves,” said Alejandro de la Torre, founder of consulting firm PoW Energy and former VP of Poolin. “They usually purchase cheaper (but still perfectly fine) second-hand machines. They also toy around with the hashing rate of their machines by either lowering or overclocking the hashrate to help match their own unique variables,” so they might be able to continue working even under these current market conditions.  Econoalchemist, a pseudonymous home miner, writer and Upstream Data affiliate, told CoinDesk that home miners can have a lot of leeway and wide operating bands, such that “extremely unfavorable market conditions would need to persist for several months” for them to unplug their machines.  Retail miners can accumulate bitcoin at a discount when the price of the asset is high, such that they can absorb market fluctuations, the home miner said. What is more, more efficient mining rig models like the S19 Pro are still breaking even at 17 cents per kilowatt hour, which is below the average U.S. utility price, he said.  But “there are limits to how high the hashrate can get and how low the price can get before a home miner may be better off unplugging their ASIC,” Econoalchemist said.  By contrast, institutional miners can mitigate market risks “by obtaining cheaper power supply, procuring the high-end mining equipment from the main machine suppliers, cooperating with more professional mining sites and pools, and hedging the volatility of bitcoin payout with financial derivatives,” f2pool’s Li said.  BitFuFu and Bitdeer, two of the world’s biggest cloud mining platforms and, therefore, major providers of hashrate to retail miners, refused to comment on this story.  The bigger difficulty picture  However, overall, in the past year, the difficulty of mining bitcoin has increased by 30%, which has over time rendered older rigs unprofitable and squeezed miners’ margins.  Luxor’s Vera noted that if miners opt to sell their machines instead of turning them off, the hashrate will stay at higher levels.  Today’s drop in the bitcoin mining difficulty will provide some “short term relief” for miners struggling to make ends meet, said Whit Gibbs, founder and CEO of Compass Mining.  As always, a lot hinges on the price of BTC; if it continues in a downward spiral, more miners will likely be priced out. “As the plug accelerates, more models will be priced out like during the bear market of 2018-2019,” f2pool’s Li said.  The value of one terahash of computing power has dramatically decreased in the past six months, from a peak of around 40 cents per terahash per day, to 12 cents for the same computing power, Luxor Mining’s Hashprice Index shows.  Opportunities are starting to arise as the market becomes distressed, Vera said. The Luxor team thinks that “there are many miners who placed large futures orders” but are no longer able to take them on and “will be looking to liquidate them,” meaning that prices for bitcoin mining rigs could “slide down further,” Vera said.  At the same time, many home miners would rather “pay a premium on their bitcoin through mining at a loss,” Econoalchemist said. That’s because many mine at home to avoid exposing themselves to privacy risks, such as know-your-customer requirements, or the possibility of assets being seized or stolen when custodied by a centralized provider like a crypto exchange, he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/25/as-bitcoin-price-slides-older-mining-rigs-are-becoming-less-profitable,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f92615fd4194b95abcd742aa08fa223c6ed55fe5-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Modular networks allow users to spin up their own blockchains at scale while maintaining the security standards of rival layer 1s, separating consensus from execution.  Because Celestia doesn’t validate transactions themselves, blockchains deployed on the network avoid being bottlenecked by state execution, a growing problem with networks like Ethereum.  The project – backed by venture firm NFX, Cosmos developer Zaki Manian and a handful of others – believes its tech could put an end to the “monolithic era” of layer 1 competition, providing a solution that is ultimately more sovereign and scalable for mass adoption, according to a press release.  “This will change the way that anyone who’s building in Web 3 can scale. From NFTs to gaming, pretty much everything has implications here,” Celestia Labs’ Ekram Ahmed told CoinDesk in an interview. “We are still in the earlier phases, and our mainnet will be in early 2023.”  Celestia crypto  Celestia was founded by Mustafa Al-Bassam, a prominent hacktivist and developer many know from being arrested by the FBI as a 16-year-old in 2011.  On the technical end, the Mamaki testnet (named after the Hawaiian tea) supports users operating nodes, receiving testnet tokens, delegating from validators and sending transactions between wallets, according to a press release.  Celestia notes that Mamaki is not the blockchain’s incentivized testnet (which rewards users with tokens for participation) that will be launched closer to the project’s mainnet next year.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED | TRADING | TIA,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/25/celestia-launches-testnet-for-first-modular-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d0c17672c8b3e96dc2daee734691ef2c6c6dcee-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374650,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1dFT,1653489936,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Struggles to Hold $30K Ahead of Fed Minutes,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Bitcoin can't seem to break the $30,000 threshold ahead of the Fed's minutes release later today. Ethereum Classic is going against the market, trading up 10% on the day.  Market Moves: Bitcoinoptions traders are more focused on hedging exposure than ever before, according to data from Arcane Research.  Feature: A snapshot of the Terra blockchain is expected this week. Shaurya Malwa takes a look at how ""new"" LUNA will be distributed.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading up on the day but struggled to remain above the $30,000 threshold. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost more than half of its value from its all-time high around $69,000 reached in November 2021.  BTC briefly hit $30,000 in the early trading hours on Wednesday but has since dropped to around $29,600. It is up 1.1% over the last 24 hours.  Ethereum (ETH) was down 0.6% on the day and is struggling to stay above $2,000.  Ethereum Classic (ETC), which has a market capitalization of $3.19 billion, was going against the market and trading 10% up on the day. Ethereum Classic is a blockchain that was created after a contentious hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain took place in 2016. It is like Ethereum in that it supports smart contracts and decentralized applications, known as dapps.  In traditional markets, Asian stocks inched higher while U.S. equity-index futures reversed earlier gains as investors awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting. Those are scheduled for release on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET (18:00 UTC).  Market Moves  As investors await the Fed minutes, the crypto market is seeing relatively muted trade.  Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack Funds, said that he does not foresee any overly optimistic outcome from the release given the language that has been adopted recently by the Fed.  For crypto, Dibb does not predict much impact. “Our expectation for crypto is generally a continuation in the current range or slight downside if macro leads,” said Dibb.  Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital-asset broker GlobalBlock, said that the Fed’s minutes could spark a relief rally in the short-term for crypto.  “As the FOMC makes key decisions about interest rates and the growth of the United States money supply, these meeting minutes will be pivotal for bitcoin’s price in the short term,” said Sotiriou. FOMC stands for Federal Open Market Committee – the Fed's panel that sets monetary policy.  If the Fed hints dovishness for the first time in a long while by mentioning no 75 basis point hikes or a pause in tightening on return to neutral rates, Sotiriou said this would be bullish and could lead to a rally in the next one or two weeks for bitcoin.  On-chain metrics  Bitcoin options traders are more focused on hedging exposure than ever before, according to data from Arcane Research.  Options traders are hedging at large, proven by skews reaching new all-time highs across durations. The 25-delta skew shows the difference between the implied volatility for put and call options at the same maturity. A positive skew signals a higher demand for put options than call options, signaling that traders are leaning bearish.  “These skew levels are unprecedented in the bitcoin options market history, suggesting a very pessimistic outlook among options traders,” wrote Arcane Research in its weekly update.  The one month (25D) skew reached a 24-hour average all-time high on May 12 of 24%, surpassing May peaks from 2020 and 2021.  The six-month 25D skew also shows a strong demand for puts, sitting at 12.57% currently, according to data from Arcane Research. The longer-dated maturities have not reached the current high levels before. On June 1, 2021, the six-month skew peaked at 4.75%.

DeFi Platform Lido Votes Against Supporting New Terra Blockchain Terra's revival plan was approved by network validators earlier Wednesday.  Web 3 Education Platform Pitches ‘Earn While You Learn’ to Business Executives Metacademy.xyz’s mix of crypto incentivization and education already boasts 2,000 users, founder Shelly Palmer told CoinDesk.  Feature: Terra Snapshot Expected This Week. Here’s How 'New' Luna Will Be Distributed  By Shaurya Malwa  A snapshot of the Terra blockchain is expected to take place later this week ahead of the launch of “Terra 2.0,” a so-called revival of the Terra ecosystem following the implosion of terraUSD (UST) earlier this month.  The revival plan is now moving forward after the conclusion Wednesday of a vote among network validators, with a 65% approval rate.  Investors who held over 10,000 LUNA before UST’s implosion will receive the new tokens periodically to prevent immediate selling. Over 30% of their tokens would be unlocked initially, and the remaining 70% would be released over two years. New tokens will be distributed after six months to such holders.  Wallets with more than 1 million LUNA or UST prior to UST’s depegging would have to wait more than a year before receiving any tokens, with a four-year vesting period thereafter, according to the revival plan.  A snapshot – meaning a recording of the state of a blockchain at a specific point in time – will allow Terra to send the newly issued LUNA tokens to holders of the old LUNA. This would, in theory, allow old holders to regain some of their lost investment value while incentivizing usage of the new blockchain.  The snapshot for the Terra 2.0 is expected on May 26. “Going by block times, the post snapshot block, 7,790,000, could happen as soon as May 26, 2022, 16:20:00 UTC,” Terra developers said in a post on Tuesday.  “The supply at genesis is considerably lower than anybody is anticipating, closer to 116.7M rising to 182M after 1 year,” they added, addressing community concerns about a highly inflated luna supply.  How the snapshot plan came about  In early May, UST lost its peg with the U.S. dollar and fell to as low as 7 cents in the weeks afterward, causing prices of its related luna (LUNA) tokens to drop 99.7% and outflows of over $28 billion from Terra-based decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.  This led to a loss of sentiment among LUNA investors and traders, apparently even sparking public outrage in Korea, where Terra had a huge community, and some crypto funds seeing billions of dollars in losses.  Terra’s oft-brash founder Do Kwon came up with a revival plan in the days afterward, proposing a “fork” of the blockchain and an “airdrop” to holders affected by the UST implosion.  The plan tries to make the community whole while reviving their trust in the Terra ecosystem.  “Fork” of a blockchain refers to the creation of a new blockchain with data from the old blockchain preceding that of the newer ones. Terra developers have, however, stated that ""Terra 2.0"" will be an entirely new project, meaning no data from the current chain will be carried on to the new one.  The revival plan, although voted to pass by Terra’s network validators, was pushed live even as results from a preliminary online poll on a hard fork plan found minimal backing among community members.  Some 92% of over 6,220 voters on a previously held online poll voted against the change, with the most popular responses calling for “no fork,” as reported.  LUNA prices are up over 6.2% in the past 24 hours.

The concept is already in exploration, with developers trying to figure out how to make it work and become as interactive and exciting as the current online dating space. However, since the metaverse is still at its initial stages of development, there is a lot of uncertainty and non-regulation.

According to the bank’s public policy analysts, legislation concerning tech regulation, cryptocurrency, pricing of prescription drugs, tax increases and China competition will have varying chances of passage by the end of 2023, depending on the outcome of the November elections.  Defining regulation for digital assets is important for the industry to grow, especially in relation to stablecoins, crypto products, institutional ownership of crypto, and the possibility of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), said the report authors.  An “extended period of uncertainty” on new legislation – as government agencies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and others fight for regulatory turf – would be a negative for the crypto industry, they added.  Policy makers in both the Democratic and Republican camps have shown frustration with current crypto regulation, arguing that stricter government oversight is needed to address a number of concerns, especially around consumer protection, the note says.  The cryptocurrency industry is having more influence on political views on both sides, with the Morgan Stanley report noting a large ramp up in lobbying spending last year.

42417146,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3g5,1653487128,'Not About Playing It Safe': Krista Kim on How Artists Inspire the Metaverse,"In a desperate attempt to stay relevant with crypto-curious audiences, marketers around the world are FOMOing into the metaverse trend, experimenting with everything from branded non-fungible token (NFT) collectibles, to virtual shops and offices, through to issuing their very own cryptocurrencies. But users are often nonplussed, getting the sense these retail schemes are more about supersizing sales than cultivating community, connection, collaboration and co-creation in the new era of Web 3.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week. Krista Kim is a speaker at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  As contemporary artist Krista Kim sees it, there are too many corporate executives conceiving these new virtual worlds and not enough artists. As the founder of the Techism Movement in 2014, Kim called for a reconciliation between technological innovation and the creation of art. In 2021, with the emergence of Web 3, she updated her original thesis to recognize the potential for blockchain to realize her vision for an open, decentralized future. With artists and creators at the helm, it’s possible to engage communities through meaningful experiences that have lasting impact and add real value to people’s lives, establishing a deeper connection with users and delivering on their desire for authenticity.  In 2020, feeling personally impacted by the isolation and emotional trauma of the coronavirus lockdown, Kim created a therapeutic escape in the form of a virtual house. Based on her digital zen philosophy, she built entirely with light to create a soothing, healing atmosphere, with musical accompaniment by Jeff Schroeder of The Smashing Pumpkins. Dubbed the “Mars House,” it was sold as the world’s first NFT home on SuperRare for 288 ETH ($512,712) in 2021.  Kim has partnered with major luxury brands including Louis Vuitton and Lanvin to help them make sense of the metaverse and find relevance with their communities. She is also the creator of Continuum Tour, a sound and light public art installation staged at Aranya Beach, China, and a contributing metaverse editor at Vogue Singapore.  In this interview, I spoke to Kim about the shift from Web 2 to Web 3, and how she sees blockchain technologies empowering sovereign individuals to thrive in a world built on immersive, inspiring and artistic experiences.  She also explains why today’s pixelated versions of the metaverse are NGMI [Not Gonna Make It], why screens are not our enemy and how DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations] can facilitate ownership and agency in a radically inclusive, optimistic and resilient future society.  This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.  As a pioneering architect of the open metaverse, what do you think people are still getting wrong about virtual worlds today?  They don't understand the long-term vision of what the metaverse is. Right now, there's a misconception that gaming platforms are the metaverse – like The Sandbox, Decentraland and Cryptovoxels – those with low-fidelity graphics, where the look of the place is highly compromised. But if you think that voxelized graphics are going to last beyond the next year or two for Gen Alpha, you're mistaken.  The future of the metaverse in terms of the quality of the graphics will be photo-real. With the introduction of more advanced hardware, like eyewear with [augmented reality] capabilities, the metaverse will be so powerful that the digital layer will be nearly indistinguishable from real life, with frictionless interplay between the two worlds.  What is your take on skeuomorphism? Why are artists and architects still designing digital objects that resemble things in the physical world, when they could create almost anything in virtual environments?  What a lot of people in businesses these days have to realize is that you cannot repeat what has been done in the past and think that you will win. The metaverse is the greatest art project in the world, and it requires imagination and creativity. That means that you have to step out of your comfort zone, but most companies don't want to do that. Most professionals who work in corporations are trained to follow the status quo or to follow workflows that have worked in the past, to play it safe.  The metaverse is not about playing it safe. The metaverse is about inspiring people and you can only do that through art. There needs to be more artists at the helm, and companies don't know how to negotiate that kind of relationship, where you have artists and creators in the lead. That's why Web 3 is a whole new phenomenon and a whole new corporate structure.  What barriers are preventing Web 2 creators from moving into Web 3?  Right now, crypto is a high-risk, volatile space. But if you’re looking through a long-term lens, the crypto revolution is already happening. We're simply in the genesis period, so that’s why people are risk averse.  You are basically shifting an entire paradigm from a corporate industrial model, where people were taught to obey and to work a nine-to-five job for a company and not have any entrepreneurial skills. Web 3 is all about the sovereign individual being empowered through blockchain to create their own destiny, through their own creations and [intellectual property], while collaborating with others and thriving.  And when you think about DAOs, they are going to transform the way the world works. It’s going to pull away from a corporate model, where the corporation is dominating the system, to communities that are coming together to solve the world's problems collaboratively – where people are actually involved and co-invested in projects. This is a completely different model for how the world will function and how things will get done. It will get done through passion and through purpose in Web 3.  So it's not just educating people on how to use crypto. It’s learning how to be a whole new kind of human being in a new world. So, of course, there's going to be friction – it’s a ​​completely different way of thinking.  Most people think they should limit their screen time, but you’ve embraced the screen as something that could bring meditative effects and even help to treat anxiety. Why?  This is a broader conversation about our relationship with technology and innovation. For the most part, there hasn't been much contribution of art into the evolution, aesthetics and uses of technology.  That is why I wrote the ""Techism Manifesto"" in 2014 because I felt the content we were consuming on screens was so commercial that there wasn't a balance. There was no truly aesthetically soothing or humane application of the technology, because art was not at the forefront. Art was not considered an important factor in the development of these technologies.  Techism is a call to action – not only in the technology world, but also among the creative world – to collaborate and co-create. Creators have to start thinking about technology as a medium, engaging with it, taking it seriously and finding ways to create that human touch.  So it's not just about screens, it's also about the content. Because the screen is a tool. Just as a surgical knife can be used to heal, it could be used to kill. The tool itself cannot be blamed. It’s the intention and the creative process that truly reveals what the effects will be in our broader society.  What has changed since you wrote your original manifesto in 2014?  Since 2014, we have seen the emergence of Web 3 through blockchain technology. Web 2 was a dark period, particularly in regards to data sovereignty. Surveillance capitalism, I believe, is a very unethical business practice of Web 2 that has dominated our lives, and it's really impacted us in a negative way.  Data is power, data ownership is a human right, and people need to be educated about the importance of that. If we were able to capture our data – that is, the personal data leakage that Web 2 companies exploit for monetary gain – and self-custody our own data, we could choose to sell or license that information and be remunerated for it. I believe that would be a fair situation, because our data is a record of who we are.  Why do you think we're seeing so few female founders in the space? How can we get more women to participate in Web 3?  It's only because we're so early. Web 3 is a space where females can naturally thrive, because it is about collaboration, co-creation and community. Women will thrive in Web 3 unlike any other era of human history, because it is accessible to us. There are no barriers to entry. It is simply a matter of engaging, initiating and creating communities or core groups and teams with other people who can contribute to a project.  About two generations from now, we will be much more unified as a transcendent culture in the metaverse. It is actually an extremely spiritual experience to meet people in the metaverse, talk to them, and only care about the person, what they say, what they are about. We're not judging them by any other factor, except maybe they have some cool wings.  Allowing people to express themselves as an avatar, no matter what their backgrounds are, makes for genuine human connections that transcend race, religion, gender, and whatever other divisions exist in the real world. All these issues will not be issues in 50 years. People will be activated around causes or common interests instead. It's going to be a whole new world.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/25/not-about-playing-it-safe-krista-kim-on-how-artists-inspire-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a250cfb353b29a150e954bfd0df296c051cb714c-2880x2160.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374436,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZViH,1653485400,StarkWare Reaches $8B Valuation Following Latest $100M Funding Round,"StarkWare Industries, which provides solutions to make blockchain technology more scalable, has raised $100 million in a Series D funding round at an $8 billion valuation, up from the $2 billion valuation at its last fundraise in November.  The round was led by investment firms Greenoaks Capital and Coatue with Tiger Global among the other participants, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk. The capital, which also included an undisclosed amount of employee stock sold in a secondary transaction, will be used for product and business development, engineering and growing the surrounding ecosystem, StarkWare CEO Uri Kolodny told CoinDesk in an interview.  Significantly, the nine-figure deal closed during a crypto bear market. According to Kolodny, StarkWare and its backers are less focused on the current prices of tech stocks or cryptocurrencies and more focused on “building for the long haul.”  What StarkWare does  StarkWare technology addresses the scalability issues of the Ethereum blockchain, which cause slow throughput and raise gas, or transaction, fees. The company has two platforms. The StarkEx scaling engine, which the company said handles more transactions per month than the Bitcoin network, powers the likes of non-fungible token (NFT) platform Immutable X and decentralized exchange dYdX. The second platform, StarkNet, launched in February and puts blockchain scaling technologies in the hands of developers building decentralized applications.  “High transaction fees and limited bandwidth on blockchains are inhibiting the mass adoption of crypto today,” said Coatue general partner Luca Schmid in the press release. “StarkWare is solving this with Validity Rollups that we believe will allow blockchain apps to serve millions of customers seamlessly.”  StarkNet rollups  Rollup technologies bundle hundreds of transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain to reduce the computational stress. Optimistic rollups use a network of validators to check that the data in the bundle is legitimate, which means the transactions can be challenged and temporarily delayed from hitting Ethereum. Zero knowledge (zk) rollups, also called validity rollups, use cryptography to mathematically validate the transaction bundle before it hits Ethereum.  StarkNet, zkSync and Aztec offer zk rollup solutions. StarkWare’s offering uses a cryptographic method called STARKs, which was developed by company co-founder and president Eli Ben-Sasson alongside other computer scientists.  “What our technology delivers – and it does so through math – is integrity at scale. And C.S. Lewis beautifully defined integrity as ‘doing the right thing even when no one is watching,” Ben-Sasson told ConDesk. “What our technology does is it uses math in order to assert to the blockchain that a huge amount of transactions was computed off-chain with integrity.”  Near-term plans for StarkWare include decentralizing StarkNet. Kolodny declined to comment on whether the process would involve a token.  “We hope to be very, very advanced on our way to full decentralization, if not already there, within the coming year,” he said.  StarkWare’s newest fundraise is the latest signal that venture capitalists are betting big on rollup technologies. Last fall, investment giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led a $50 million funding round for zkSync creator Matter Labs. And in March, a16z participated in the $150 million fundraise for rollup provider Optimism at a $1.65 billion valuation.

Wormhole has partnered with Injective, an Ethereum-compatible blockchain that is able to natively communicate with Cosmos. Cosmos’ ATOM token currently boasts a market cap of over $3 billion, making it a top 30 token by market cap, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  “With Wormhole being a major force within the crypto industry, the partnership will be focused on expanding Injective’s network and supporting new dApps built on top of the blockchain moving forward,” said Eric Chen, CEO of Injective Labs, in a statement.  A cross-chain future  As layer 1 blockchains compete to amass total value locked (TVL) and users, investors and builders are increasingly focusing on interoperability solutions.  Popular layer 1, or base-layer, blockchains, such as Ethereum, Avalanche and Solana, cannot easily communicate with each other, meaning assets held on one blockchain are difficult to transfer onto another.  When tokens are bridged through Wormhole’s Portal Bridge, the original token is locked in a smart contract while a new Portal-wrapped version of that token gets minted on the target chain. Then, the wrapped tokens can be traded for tokens native to the target chain and used for decentralized finance (DeFi).  The integration makes Injective the primary gateway for cross-chain native assets from other prominent layer 1 chains to enter the Cosmos universe.  According to its website, Injective’s venture capital backers include Pantera Capital, Hashed and entrepreneur Mark Cuban.

The fund will continue Volt’s thesis of backing infrastructure, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) projects, Volt founder Soona Amhaz told CoinDesk in an interview.  Volt Capital was one of the original contributors to crypto accelerator program DeFi Alliance; it launched a $10 million investment fund in April 2021. Backers for the new fund include Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) General Partners Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon, angel investor Elad Gil, Union Square Ventures Managing Partner Albert Wenger, global investment firm Tiger Global and European hedge fund manager Brevan Howard.  The larger fund gives Volt more room to pursue investments, said Amhaz, though the firm will remain focused on the pre-seed, seed and Series A rounds that are sometimes overlooked by larger funds.

The fund news comes as crypto markets turn cold. A16z has a price-innovation cycle thesis that said high crypto prices bring in interest, while downturns provide a time for developer and startup fruition.

In late April, sellers pushed the ATOM price below $20 and began panic sales in the market. In 5 weeks, the coin price fell by 76%. Buyers were able to stop this horror only at around $9. This is a super-powerful mirror level, which initially restrained growth in August 2020, and in May-June 2021 kept the price from falling. https://www.tradingview.com/x/grvrtF65/ If we consider the most pessimistic scenario for the ATOM cryptocurrency - we should expect a rebound from $9 to $15. At this point, sellers can reactivate and push the coin price to $9 to break down. Though, given the likelihood of BTC starting a new growth wave, the best scenario for ATOM cryptocurrency is the growth to $20-$22. That&apos;s where the powerful liquidity zone is located, which sellers should not allow to pass from the first time.

The revival plan was approved by Terra’s network validators today.  Lido, a liquid staking protocol, is the fourth-largest DeFi platform, with $8.43 billion in total valued locked, according to DeFi Llama.  Kwon's proposal is to carry out a hard fork of the blockchain, with the original chain continuing as Terra Classic. The new one will focus on attracting DeFi applications.  A hard fork involves splitting the chain on which a protocol runs into two, with the new branch using a different set of rules. It represents an opportunity for Terra to perform a reset on its failed project, which saw native stablecoin UST and sister token LUNA collapse to near zero earlier this month.  However, initial reaction to Kwon's plans was largely negative with some 92% of 6,220 Terra community members voting against the change.

The increase in investor interest occurred after sellers broke the mark of $0.31. So far, starting in February 2021, the GRT price has fallen in low volumes.

42393831,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBc6h,1653478200,What Impact Will a Bear-Market Merge Have on Ethereum?,"The past couple of weeks have been some of the most tumultuous in the history of crypto. As the broader cryptocurrency and equity markets have plunged into bear market territory, the price of ether (ETH) has collapsed to numbers we haven’t seen since 2021. Meanwhile, Terra’s hugely popular stablecoin ecosystem collapsed spectacularly, wiping out over $40 billion in value and sending ripple effects across decentralized finance (DeFi).  And as if all this wasn’t enough, one of the largest non-fungible token (NFT) collections has recently become embroiled in a controversy that places its creator at the center of a racist online cult.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  But, hey, it’s not all doom and gloom in cryptoland. As markets fall and reputations crater, Ethereum’s community is still hard at work preparing for the Merge – its long-anticipated transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. After signs the network upgrade would be delayed – yet again – past the summer, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said at an event in Shanghai last week that the Merge may finally be ready in August.  Read more: How Ethereum Will Be Transformed in 2022  The PoS Merge has been envisioned as a way to improve Ethereum security and decrease energy consumption, all while setting the stage for broader network capacity and fee improvements. But with the recent market downturn comes an important question – will a bear-market Merge blunt the upgrade’s impact?  A bear-market Merge and investor sentiment  First, a quick caveat: I am not a markets reporter. While there are some great journalists at CoinDesk and elsewhere who analyze prices and report on market trends, this newsletter is not going to contain any deeply informed insight into how the price of ether might move as a result of the Merge.  But I’ll hazard a guess anyway. For years, speculators have pointed to the Merge as an event certain to boost Ethereum's token price to sky-high levels, perhaps even surpassing that of bitcoin (BTC). Why this should occur has always been vague: It’s difficult to point to many ether price “fundamentals.” While PoS will change some of Ethereum’s tokenomics, ether’s price – like that of most other cryptocurrencies – is mainly a reflection of general market sentiment. With this bear market seemingly poised to last through to August, market sentiment once the Merge hits is likely to be a resounding “meh.”  While the nitty-gritty of the Merge has not changed, this new context in which it will occur still feels relevant. The fact that Ethereum has entered a down market will have important implications for how the upcoming Merge is received by its community and by investors.  Read more: How a Post-Merge Ethereum Could Attract Institutional Investment  Crypto during a bear market  Price shouldn’t be the only focus of crypto’s recent market downturn, and it’s not too difficult to predict what sour market conditions might mean for the crypto industry writ large.  With less money flowing into crypto (and other speculative asset classes, one presumes), fewer folks will enter crypto in search of short-term gains. Moreover, one expects many of the investors and developers who entered the space at the highs of crypto’s bull market will flee the space in search of greener, more stable pastures.  I imagine many of those who find jobs in crypto in the coming months (or years) are likely to head toward bigger-name companies like Coinbase (COIN) rather than comparatively risky DeFi bets and newer blockchains. With VC funding drying up, the nascent projects that do survive will do so on account of their talent and technology rather than their ability to garner crypto-crazed valuations and short-term mercenary capital.  Of course, there’s also a potential scenario where scammy NFT projects and Ponzi-esque DeFi protocols continue to see interest from retail investors looking for a quick buck – especially when the stock market can’t be relied upon to deliver high returns. While I’m sure there will be some degeneracy mixed in with everything else, it’s hard to imagine big-name investors will invest hundreds of millions of dollars into unproven experiments like Terra again anytime soon.  Dot-com case study  Amid all the bad news, the past couple of years have been extremely positive for the cryptocurrency space in a number of respects. With VCs frothing at the mouth to fund anything and everything “crypto,” we’ve probably seen some solid, albeit risky bets get funding that would have been dismissed in more conservative times.  Moreover, even as the NFT market and many DeFi protocols have been crushed under the weight of the wider market downturn, a boom in these sectors has introduced a much larger audience to crypto.  A telling, if unoriginal, comparison with respect to this period in crypto could be made to the dot-com boom and bust of the early millennium. While many of the companies funded before the bubble burst ultimately came to naught, the initial boom still paved the way for much of what emerged in the years that followed.  As Silicon Valley sage Ben Thompson put it in one of his 2021 newsletters:  In the earliest days of the internet, “websites proliferated rapidly, as did dreams about what this new technology might make possible. This mania led to the dot-com bubble, which, critically, fueled massive investments in telecoms infrastructure. Yes, the companies like Worldcom, NorthPoint and Global Crossing making these investments went bankrupt, but the foundation had been laid for widespread high-speed connectivity.”  After the dot-com bubble burst, eventual Big Tech titans including Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY), which were funded alongside shallower bets like Pets.com, went into heads-down mode. These companies wouldn’t have succeeded if not for the infrastructure funded during the internet era’s initial ill-fated funding craze.  Looking toward the Ethereum Merge  In my eyes, this is where work on the Ethereum Merge sits. Rain or shine, the Merge does seem like it’ll happen. Even if it doesn’t wind up being a huge boon to ether’s price, it will, if developers are to be believed, have lasting implications for the future of the network.  The news that the Merge might be due in August came on the heels of two more successful Ethereum mainnet shadow forks; one on May 12 and another on May 20. If you’ve read previous issues of this newsletter, you may recall that a shadow fork is like a test run of Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. Mainnet shadow forks – which simulate the PoS transition using the most intense, real-word conditions – are one of the final steps of testing developers will need to take before they deem the network ready to upgrade. Aside from a couple of very minor hiccups, both of the most recent forks appeared to go well.  The Twitter discourse in the Ethereum developer community these past few weeks, while certainly cognizant of wider market conditions, has been pretty cheery with the news that the Merge is nearing completion. Ether’s price might not reflect this same level of enthusiasm come the Merge, but these past few weeks have added to a consistent string of reminders that prices are among the least interesting parts of this space.

Web 3 game studio MetaKing Studios has raised $15 million in a seed funding round that included Makers Fund and Bitkraft Ventures, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk. The funding will be used for game development and a marketing campaign for the studio’s first game, Blocklords, a massively multiplayer online (MMO) title set in medieval times that’s slated to launch next year.  Other participants in the funding round included Delphi Digital, Animoca Brands, Shima Capital, WW Ventures, Spartan Group and Huobi Ventures, among others.  The gameplay of Blocklords was inspired by titles like Total War, Age of Empires, Civilization and Crusader Kings, MetaKing Studios co-founder and CEO David Johansson told CoinDesk in an interview.  “What we’re trying to do is have the first MMO grand strategy game with features from turn-based strategy and also real-time strategy,” Johansson said.  Founded by game industry veterans Johansson and Nicky LI, the MetaKing Studio team includes more than 100 artists, designers and developers with experience at top game studios such as Electronic Arts and Ubisoft.  What the game is like  Blocklords combines real-time battles, fantasy lore and a detailed lineage system. Players own non-fungible token (NFT) Hero characters, who can develop skills, trade, participate in battles and create a bloodline through marriages and births.  Players will be able to get started in Blocklords for free with the game providing an entry-level Hero character.  “You’re not going to be a powerful lord or lady or a powerful king or queen, but you’ll be able to kind of join up under another lord’s banner, start up your own little farm and start gathering resources that way,” explained Johansson.  “I do believe games should be free to get into and then once you get deeper and deeper into it, us as game designers can unleash different ways for users to get involved either by paying resources or playing with skills,” he continued.  The first Hero mints will happen this summer on Immutable X, the carbon-neutral layer 2 blockchain for NFTs. Johansson eventually sees a multichain future for Blocklords.

42423254,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XlLh,1653474973,Terra Snapshot Expected This Week. Here’s How 'New' Luna Will Be Distributed,"A snapshot of the Terra blockchain is expected to take place later this week ahead of the launch of “Terra 2.0,” a so-called revival of the Terra ecosystem following the implosion of the terraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin earlier this month.  The revival plan is now moving forward after the conclusion Wednesday of a vote among network validators, with a 65% approval rate.  Investors who held over 10,000 LUNA tokens before UST’s implosion will receive the new tokens periodically, to prevent immediate selling. Over 30% of their tokens would be unlocked initially, and the remaining 70% would be released over two years. New tokens will be distributed after six months to such holders.  Wallets with more than 1 million LUNA or UST prior to UST’s depegging from the U.S. dollar would have to wait more than a year before receiving any tokens, with a four-year vesting period thereafter, according to the revival plan.  A snapshot – meaning a recording of the state of a blockchain at a specific point in time – will allow Terra to send the newly issued LUNA tokens to holders of the old LUNA. This would, in theory, allow old holders to regain some of their lost investment value while incentivizing usage of the new blockchain.  The snapshot for Terra 2.0 is expected on Thursday. “Going by block times, the post snapshot block, 7,790,000, could happen as soon as May 26, 2022, 16:20:00 UTC,” Terra developers said in a post on Tuesday.  “The supply at genesis is considerably lower than anybody is anticipating, closer to 116.7M rising to 182M after [one] year,” they added, addressing community concerns about a highly inflated luna supply.  How the snapshot plan came about  In early May, UST lost its peg with the U.S. dollar and fell to as low as 7 cents in the weeks afterward, causing prices of its related luna (LUNA) token to drop 99.7% and outflows of over $28 billion from Terra-based decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.  This led to a loss of sentiment among LUNA investors and traders, apparently even sparking public outrage in South Korea, where Terra had a huge community. Some crypto funds were hit with billions of dollars in losses.  Terra’s often-brash founder Do Kwon came up with a revival plan in the days afterward, proposing a fork of the blockchain and an airdrop to holders affected by the UST implosion.  The plan tries to make the community whole while reviving their trust in the Terra ecosystem.  A blockchain fork usually refers to the creation of a new blockchain with data from the old blockchain. While this plan may seem like a fork, Terra developers have stated that Terra 2.0 will be an entirely new project, and no data from the current chain will be carried on to the new one.  The revival plan, although passed by Terra’s network validators, was pushed live even as results from a preliminary online poll on a hard fork plan found minimal backing among community members.  Some 92% of over 6,220 voters on a previously held online poll voted against the change, with the most popular responses calling for “no fork,” as reported.  LUNA was up over 6.2% in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | TRADING | AIRDROP | FORKS,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/25/terra-snapshot-expected-this-week-heres-how-new-luna-will-be-distributed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de393cb4f905db5cf59278f0277b82aeb5069354-3000x1968.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423250,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XlJh,1653462000,Crypto Asset Managers Chase Yield With New Investment Products,"Crypto shops are betting on lending amid the market downturn with yield products that boast modest annual returns – by the industry’s lofty standards, at least – on their clients’ dollars  Turning loaned dollars into more dollars is hardly a new proposition in crypto: myriad decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols woo stablecoin holders with a handful of basis points. Terra’s recently imploded Anchor offered 20% yields generated through murky means.  By contrast, the new yield products generate their returns through “rational” rails, said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer for Bitwise, which is rolling out a “USD Income Fund” that loans investors’ dollars to counterparties like Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini (who then loan them into the stablecoin market) in the chase for 4% to 8% yields.  “You can think of us as an aggregation point for cash that is entering this market,” Hougan said on a call. “There’s significant demand for cash in the crypto economy.” He said some of that pressure comes from the void usually filled by traditional lending institutions “unwilling” to loan to a risky industry.  In the short term, that discrepancy could prove highly lucrative for lenders willing to stomach some of the risk. Their dollars can do a lot more work in the crypto economy than in their near-zero interest rate savings accounts, especially given inflation.  “People are being forced to search for yield,” Hougan said, and that’s prompting fund providers to innovate.  Yield hunters  European crypto issuer 21Shares’ USD Yield ETP (USDY) and its 5% target yield is the latest iteration. Listed on the Swiss SIX exchange Wednesday, it plans to lend each invested dollar out for somewhere between $1.10 and $1.50 in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as collateral – a sort of insurance policy if the borrower implodes.  “So if the counterparty goes bye-bye” explained President Ophelia Snyder, ”we can just go knock on the custodian’s door and say, ‘Hey, they're gone. Give us our money back.’”  Snyder said 21Shares plans to lend investors’ assets out to BlockFi.  The risk of imploding crypto counterparties was on full display earlier this month when the algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and sister token LUNA went into a death spiral. One of the big appeals of that troubled ecosystem were the eye-catching but unsustainable yields of Terra’s Anchor protocol.  Terra’s floundering yield schemes have little in common with USDY, Snyder said. For starters, USDY takes collateral to protect its investors against a counterparty’s default. This may limit the yield generation upside but it does so in the name of “risk adjusted” returns. In her view, that’s a worthwhile tradeoff for investors getting pummeled by market forces.  “Virtually every type of financial product on the market right now is negative. Holding cash has a negative real interest rate. And that's a really important thing to realize,” she said. “This product is particularly well adapted against this backdrop.”",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/25/crypto-asset-managers-chase-yield-with-new-investment-products,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/190dcc2d8c428674744f95af2e1cb4323603dafa-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It all started on April 2nd, when Elon Musk tweeted &apos;Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It&apos;s pretty cool.&apos; In the weeks that followed, Dogecoin - cryptocurrency&apos;s original meme - skyrocketed from a meager $0.05 to a high of $0.75 on May 7th. That means a DOGE holder who had $100 of Dogecoin on April 2nd would have had $1500 less than a month later. With the Tesla CEO incorporating DOGE into its accepted payments for merchandise sales and supercharging stations and suggesting that people who subscribe to Twitter Blue should be able to pay with Dogecoin, DOGE itself (approximately $0.08 at the time of writing) still has massive upside potential. But many feel as though they&apos;ve missed out on the asset&apos;s heyday. They&apos;re looking for the next 10,000x that only comes from early adoption. These five dog-themed coins have the potential to do just that. Baby Doge ($BABYDOGE) is a deflationary token designed to become more scarce over time. They charge a 5% fee for each sale of the asset and redistribute that fee to Baby Doge Coin holders - meaning the longer you hold, the more you can earn. It&apos;s worth noting that Musk himself tweeted about Baby Doge on July 1st 2021. Currently, Baby Doge sits at $263 million market cap. Dogelon Mars ($ELON) is a dog-themed project that seeks to outpace Dogecoin&apos;s success.

However, these emotions can be detrimental when it comes to cryptocurrency trading. One of these is Fear of Missing Out(FOMO), which happens when the market experiences high price fluctuations leading to an emotional call when trading instead of a technical one. When this happens, the investor might either sell too soon and lose the profits or buy very late, and prices tank. It could lead to portfolio damage and high losses over a long period due to impulse decision-making when a digital asset experiences extreme price swings. We shall look into the best indicator for crypto trading to help you when going through FOMO to decide on his article; Fear &amp; Greed Index The Fear and Greed Index is a sentiment analysis tool that generates a number between 1 and 100 and can be used as a crypto FOMO indicator. It uses social media activity, Google trends, Bitcoin dominance, polling, volatility, and the trading volume to develop the index. Investors tend to get greedy when the market rises, leading to FOMO. It is reflected in the fear that they might not be able to take advantage of the market&apos;s opportunities. Hence, the index reads a higher number.

At the moment, this coin remains the second-largest by market cap. However, a few years after the launch, ETH&apos;s slow transaction speed became a severe problem. Ethereum has a transaction throughput of fewer than 15 transactions every second but has millions of active network users. The low transaction throughput in Ethereum has been more noticeable, especially as the network continues to grow. When the DeFi space came, transactions became harder and took longer to complete. Later joined NFTs, and the traffic around Dapps continued to make problems even bigger in the network. Ethereum effectively became a very slow blockchain, and gas charges soared.

To solve the problem, Ethereum announced the coming of ETH 2.0. One of the benefits of the beacon chain is massive transactions per second. In fact, according to reports, this Ethereum L1 chain will be able to support at least 100 thousand transactions every second. So, how is this high TPS going to be achieved?

It&apos;s part of a worldwide web 2.0 which has massive flaws. Most projects based on Web 2.0, including Google, social media networks, and others, have been accused of messing with consumer data. Fortunately, after Blockchain&apos;s launch in 2009, a web 3.0 system was discovered. It combines features like tokenization and decentralization at its core. Web 3.0 has been termed the much-awaited Google killer. This guide explores eight reasons why web 3.0 will kill Google. Decentralizes Ownership of Data One of the biggest prons associated with the web 3.0 over Google is the decentralized data ownership. In the web2, data owners are mostly the giant social networking pages like Facebook, Twitter, or even Amazon. While data garnered in web2 is often used to improve services, most centralized networks sell the data to other marketers. The collection and transfer of information in web2 majorly depend on the efficiency of social media networks. Using the power of blockchain, web3 decentralizes the whole idea of data ownership.
