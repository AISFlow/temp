42395991,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Nfw,1645401342,First Mover Asia: The Renminbi Rises; Cryptos Suffer Another Lost Weekend,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Insights: The renminbi is on the rise; the eCNY face-plants at the Winter Olympics. Cryptos tumble over the weekend.  Technician's take: BTC momentum signals remain negative, indicating consistent selling pressure over the past month.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $38,724 -3.3%  Ether (ETH): $2,649 -3.8%  Top Gainers  ` Asset Ticker Returns Sector Solana SOL +1.0% Smart Contract Platform`  Top Losers  ` Asset Ticker Returns Sector Polygon MATIC −5.7% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP −5.6% Computing Cardano ADA −5.4% Smart Contract Platform`  Markets  S&P 500: 4,348 -0.7%  DJIA: 34,079 -0.6%  Nasdaq: 13,548 -1.3%  Gold: $1,897 -.07%  Weekend market moves  Bitcoin tumbled below $40,000 in the early weekend hours and kept dipping amid rising tensions on the Ukraine-Russia border and continued inflationary fears. Ether and almost all other major cryptos also dropped.  A possible exploit of OpenSea, the leading NFT platform, may have further frightened investors away from crypto.  All these factors may have ""led investors to risk-off from crypto,"" said Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital.  At the time of publication, bitcoin was trading at around $38,700, a 3.3% drop over the past 24 hours and its lowest level since Feb. 3. Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was changing hands at slightly over $2,600, off nearly 4% and its lowest point since the first week of the month.  The declines came as U.S. intelligence reported that Russia had already decided to invade Ukraine. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN's State of the Union talk show that “everything leading up to the actual invasion appears to be taking place. All of these false-flag operations, all these provocations to create justifications — all that is already in train.” Meanwhile, investors were gearing for the first of what is expected to be several Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.  Separately, in a late Saturday tweet, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer wrote that “32 users thus far have signed a malicious payload from an attacker, and some of their NFTs were stolen.” Finzer suggested that a fraudulent website may be to blame. OpenSea said in a separate tweet that it was investigating the incident.  DiPasquale sees the next Bitcoin support line at about $35,000.  He noted that Solana was the only altcoin among the top 20 by market cap on the CoinDesk price page to rise over the weekend, reflecting ""some strength from investors due to being a Proof of Stake protocol."" But DiPasquale called that increase ""simply price recovery"" because Solana had fallen more sharply than Bitcoin and other altcoins. ""While Bitcoin is largely flat for February, Solana is still down, so its recovery simply returns it closer to parity of gains and losses for other crypto assets.""  Insights  PetroYuan, Digital Yuan, More Like One Big Yawn!  As last week came to a close in Asia, Chinese state media reported that China’s currency, the renminbi, was on the rise. Citing data from SWIFT, traditional finance's closed ledger for interbank fund transfer, China media said the value of RMB payments increased by 10.85% compared with December. Now, the RMB accounts for 3.2% of all transactions worldwide, up from 2% in November. Meanwhile, Britain’s pound accounts for 6.3% of global transactions.  In many ways, this is the capstone of two other RMB-related stories from the week: a reiteration of an announcement that gas producer Gazprom Neft will accept the RMB instead of dollars for fueling Russian airplanes at China’s airports, and China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the eCNY, made its Winter Olympics debut inside the games’ closed loop.  But neither of these stories are as earth-shattering as Beijing might have hoped.  Inbound flights into China sank to around 500 per week from 10,000 pre-coronavirus pandemic; only a fraction of these are from Russia. Oil is still priced globally in U.S. dollars (USD).  As for the eCNY, the Olympics were supposed to be its coming-out party, where foreign tourists would exchange their greenbacks or euros for some sweet reminbi issued on a digital ledger. But the borders are still closed. No foreign tourists are invited. Locals that were able to attend the games used eCNY at venues — cash was barred — while the few foreigners in attendance used Visa, the official credit card partner of the games.  Foreigners at the games, as The Wall Street Journal reported, preferred to use Visa. “What’s the difference from using my Visa card then?” one asked when they were told they could load their foreign currency onto a plastic eCNY card or hardware wallet. And for the more remote venues that didn’t have a eCNY reader before they were sealed off from the outside world as part of the Olympic bubble, it was back to AliPay or WeChat Pay, the favorite payment mechanism for many in China.  All of this is a micro example of a macro problem for China. When it comes to digital currency, the USD is still king. In 2020, Chainalysis reported that $50 billion in capital flowed out from China in crypto and mostly in dollar-pegged tether.  As Bloomberg commodity strategist Mike McGlone has pointed out, the best thing for the dollar is crypto.  “Despite the shrinking U.S. portion of the world’s GDP, the dollar increasingly dominates, notably in the digital ecosystem,” McGlone wrote in April 2021. “There appears to be little to stop the most consistent trends in crypto assets: rising trading volume and the proliferation of stablecoins tracking the dollar.”  And these stablecoins currently have a market cap of $183 billion, according to CoinGecko, with tether dominating by a large margin. You have to scroll down to the eighteenth position to find a non-USD or gold stablecoin, and that’s tether paired with the euro with a measly market cap of $234 million.  Despite Beijing’s digital dreams, the eCNY will be a tough sell on the market because of capital controls on the yuan. This is why China is only marketing it domestically now.  The few yuan that are allowed to leave the country have a specific pathway to the outside world via Hong Kong’s vast ""offshore"" RMB liquidity pools where they end up being converted to the freely convertible Hong Kong dollar, the original ""stablecoin"" with its USD peg.  Tim Draper had a simpler take on it, which he shared on a podcast in May 2020.  “I wouldn’t want to take Chinese digital currency anymore than I’d want to take renminbi,” he said. “If you digitize [the] renminbi, you are still stuck with most of the problems that you have with current political currency, with fiat currency.”  Technician's take  Bitcoin Under Pressure, Lower Support at $30K-$35K  Bitcoin (BTC) remains in its short-term downtrend begun in November, currently off 40% from its all-time high near $69,000. The cryptocurrency tested initial support at $40,000 on Friday, although stronger support is seen at $30,000, which was roughly the bottom of 2021's sell-off.  Momentum signals remain negative, indicating consistent selling pressure over the past month. Further, BTC was unable to break above its 40-week moving average at $45,724, which presents a bearish bias.  Still, the relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly chart is rising from its most oversold level since March 2020. That could keep short-term buyers active so long as the $30,000 support level holds.  If the $28,000-$30,000 range is broken, prices could experience additional downside, similar to the 80% peak-to-trough decline during the 2018 bear market.

American investor and founder of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, Tyler Winklevoss, is immensely bullish on crypto. In a tweet, Winklevoss said that he was so bullish on crypto that he hadn&apos;t checked the prices in weeks. While the Gemini founder may be overly confident about the crypto market, others took the claim with a pinch of salt. Billy Markus, one of the founders of the popular meme token Dogecoin said that he had checked the prices and it was nothing to feel good about. Bitcoin&apos;s Price Crashes Below $40,000 Over the Weekend Regardless of how bullish Tyler Winklevoss might be on crypto, one can&apos;t shy away from the fact that the crypto market slowed down over the weekend.

42421680,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovb3,1645372200,BlackRock Has Entered the Chat,"Like peering inside a house through different windows, reading any one news story or data point may offer a useful perspective on the crypto markets, but none on its own can give you the full picture. For Crypto Long & Short this week, I wanted to take three seemingly unconnected stories from the last week or so and tie them together.  Aladdin’s magic carpet  CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports that BlackRock may be planning to offer crypto trading to its clients through Aladdin, the $10 trillion asset manager’s integrated investment management platform. This cuts against what CEO Larry Fink said in July (which conveniently happened around the time I last wrote for this newsletter). Fink indicated there was “little demand” for crypto assets from clients, which wasn’t really surprising given those clients include pension funds, endowments and other types of conservative capital with infinite time horizons. However, one of Ian’s sources said of BlackRock: “They see all the flow that everyone else is getting and want to start making some money from this.” Still, it is a bit surprising that the potential Aladdin offering appears to extend beyond bitcoin, though it’s unclear which other “crypto assets” BlackRock would offer to clients. Bitcoin had solidified itself as crypto’s “blue-chip” asset around the time MassMutual made a $100 million purchase in 2020.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Maybe crypto’s total market cap settling somewhere between $1.5 trillion and $3.0 trillion for the last year or so changed minds at BlackRock. Maybe it was Jump Trading finally diving into crypto in September. Maybe enough Zoomers pestered their high-net-worth parents about cryptocurrencies at dinner tables until it hit a tipping point. Whatever the catalyst, I think the news is far more important than people are giving it credit for. BlackRock wouldn’t explore something if there wasn’t demand for it. On top of that, Aladdin powers the back office for at least $20 trillion of assets, equivalent to 10% of global stocks and bonds. Most importantly, you can’t ignore the gravity that could eventually be BlackRock signaling that “crypto is OK.”  I know investors are independent thinkers, but it sure helps when the $10 trillion giant corroborates your views.  Where is this bitcoin going?  The amount of bitcoin held on exchanges has gone down every day since Jan. 22 of this year. This caught my eye in Glassnode’s weekly on-chain metrics report, which you should definitely check out if quality data analysis excites you.  This sort of stuff happens in cycles for bitcoin. Sometimes investors want to de-risk and sell coins, so inflows to exchanges spike. Other times, investors want to hold, so outflows from exchanges to more permanent (“cold”) storage spike. It’s no surprise that this three-week period of outflows happened during bitcoin’s run-up from $33,000 to $45,000 because fewer bitcoins on exchanges theoretically eases selling pressure.     So is anyone selling bitcoin?  If someone is, it certainly isn’t publicly traded bitcoin miner Marathon (NASDAQ : MARA). At least, that’s according to a tweet the company sent out last Monday in response to a Bloomberg article that suggested miners were selling coins in a “worrying sign of a shakeout.” In theory, miners make money by mining bitcoin and immediately selling it for the local currency in order to pay expenses (most utilities and landlords don’t accept magic internet money). In reality, a number of these are well-capitalized firms that don’t need to sell bitcoin continuously  Yet, despite Marathon’s tweet, miners did mostly sell coins starting Feb. 5 through this weekend following accumulation since Nov. 19. But to call this activity “worrying” seems mistaken. Shorter periods of net selling from miners isn’t really associated with the type of price weakness that would worry a seasoned investor. To boot, the last prolonged period of net selling by miners was from January to March 2021, a period which was punctuated by astounding price performance and the first time bitcoin broke $60,000.  Everything is delicately tied together  The three preceding narratives are loosely tied together.  Some people think bitcoiners are attempting to rebuild the financial system with code, and that along the way these coders are learning why things are the way they are. I partially agree, but I mostly disagree. Bitcoin is different and the system these devs are building is in its own category. This is precisely why it makes total sense that BlackRock is getting involved in bitcoin and other cryptos.  Miners are the commercial infrastructure of Bitcoin. Without them, transactions couldn’t happen and new bitcoin couldn’t be issued. However, miners aren’t the ones facilitating the order books that give it a price in dollars, ether, dogecoin or whatever. That’s the job of exchanges, traders and market makers. Some may see miners as analogous to the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury Department, minting currency for circulation into the economy. However, miners are also likened to Visa because they enable transaction settlement. But also, not really. The point is, Bitcoin doesn’t perfectly fit into any box we have right now.  Ancillary businesses around miners include the crypto exchanges that facilitate secondary market trading between crypto assets. Exchanges are important – they are among the most valuable companies in the space – in that they give relative value to bitcoin and by extension, the multitudes of alternative crypto assets that were inspired by it.  In its role as an asset manager, BlackRock counts itself as one of the most important parties in facilitating the government securities trading that gives U.S. monetary policy teeth. This is a vaunted position in the global economy not to be taken lightly. That said, beyond helping move financial instruments as needed for the Fed, BlackRock takes part in other ancillary businesses where it can make money, such as buying and selling equities, commodities and real estate on behalf of those businesses or its investors.  But BlackRock is still just that: an ancillary business around the Fed and the economic machine. An ancillary business with a whole lot of capital (and single-family homes). In all, crypto simply represents a new asset class that BlackRock hasn’t had the pleasure of making money in yet. That’s why it looks to be extending beyond bitcoin. BlackRock doesn’t need crypto, yet, but it sure won’t hurt it to get involved now.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/20/blackrock-has-entered-the-chat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fefc28933be558e10e14e0501cd922d8540ecd8e-5472x3078.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424653,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVfph,1645369200,"The Macro Moment Hits: Central Banks, Interest Rates and Bitcoin","This period is a “macro moment” for financial markets.  Cryptocurrencies have entered another correction cycle, with the price of bitcoin and ether down about 35% from their November highs.  Interest rates are rising as central banks take measures to fight inflation; higher yields could offer an alternative to other asset classes. This reaction illustrates a principle of economics 101.  David Leibowitz is co-founder of LeboBTC Ledger Group (LLG), a consulting firm that helps clients invest in and custody crypto assets.  Yet, for the first time in the history of “free markets,” that assumption could be incorrect. Why? Because central banks can never raise rates meaningfully again. The era of Paul Volcker hiking rates to over 20% to kill the energy-led inflation of the 1970s is a thing of the distant past.  The ‘Death of Fixed Income’ revisited  In April 2020, I published an article originally titled “The Death of Fixed Income and the Rise of Bitcoin.” In it, I postulated that fixed income as an investable asset class, which comprised some part of 50% of most investment portfolios, was dead and buried, never again to be seen as a safe haven for portfolio investment, positive returns and savings.  The rationale is that in reaction to the Great Recession of 2008 and the malaise of a recovery that ensued, central banks drove interest rates to zero and below. Meanwhile, governments printed fiat debt to levels that could never be repaid, let alone serviced should interest rates rise meaningfully. Investors would need to move capital aggressively out of fixed income and into stocks, real estate, safe haven commodities such as gold and silver, and other alternative assets such as private equity, venture capital, collectables such as art and fine wine, and cryptocurrencies, specifically bitcoin, in order to find alpha.  Indeed, over an 18-month period, that is exactly what happened. The S&P 500 stock index rallied from 2,300 to 4,800 while the Nasdaq outperformed its peers trading up from 6,900 to 16,000. Gold traded up from $1,650/oz. to $2,000 before leveling off mid-range around $1,800 for the past year. Real estate ripped higher.  And bitcoin? It exploded from a March 2020 low of under $4,000 to a high of $69,000 this past November, before retracing to its current level around $42,000 at the time of publication.  COVID-19's impact on the global system  It’s now February 2022. The world has been hacked by COVID-19 and its latest variant, Omicron. Many expect this pandemic will be part of our new normal like the cold or flu.  Governments worldwide have written blank checks to support failing businesses and then some. Workers and students have been off campus for what feels like a lost two years. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is now at a record $8.9 trillion.  A supply chain crisis has created havoc with everything from lumber to computer chips to used cars, culminating in the recent spike in inflation to an annualized 7% – a level not seen in 40 years. Markets have taken notice as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has changed its tune from “inflation is transitory” to “inflation is concerning.” Economists now expect the Fed to hike the Fed Funds rate to a total of between 1% and 2% this year from its current 0-25 basis points (bps).  In the past two months, major stock indices have fallen 10% to 15%, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq. U.S. two-year Treasury note yields have risen some 90 basis points to about 1.55%, and the U.S. 10-year yields have risen 60 bps to about 1.95%. The yield curve has flattened in anticipation of the coming rate hikes.  The emperor has no clothes  Stanley Druckenmiller, one of the great traders of this generation, stated in May that should the yield on the U.S. 10-year note rise to 4.9%, the United States would be paying 30% of annual GDP simply to service the interest on outstanding debt. What that means is that we, the collective debt-ridden world, are broke, and that policy (both monetary and political) is simply to buy time and maintain the calm. Rates will rise, but the pace and extent of the moves will be limited by geopolitical agreements not to rock the boat of the global economy and expose the emperor of debt who truly has no clothes.  Yes, central banks are going to begin raising interest rates. Setting the extent of rate hikes aside for a moment, the investor community has to ask itself a question: At what interest rate would one consider putting fixed income securities back in an investment portfolio? Differentiate between a risk asset, such as low credit-rated bonds that may offer 5% to 10% but are as risky as equities, from government guaranteed securities. Would 3% yields on a 10-year note attract investment capital? How about 5%?  The point is, there is no viable interest rate level that will attract savers to the fixed income markets. At current interest rate levels, and given projected inflation, holding a dollar for 10 years creates a roughly 18% loss in purchasing power, so how does an investor protect oneself?  The cosmic shift out of bonds has not ended. The jet fuel of potential higher rates will propel those who have not abandoned fixed income to seek investments in other asset classes. Higher yields will accelerate bond sales as fixed income investors will soon have paper losses in their portfolios. Yes, they can still hold their bonds and clip their coupons, but should investors want to sell those assets prior to maturity, they will likely be selling at a loss.  Thus, the premise of my 2020 article has evolved but not changed. Alternative assets to fixed income are the only assets that offer alpha for investors. The bear case for stocks is that higher yields represent a threat to an overvalued market. It is my belief that the argument doesn’t hold water given the limited upside for yields.  That does not mean that markets can’t sell off. They do, in the normal course of valuation. But given the investable landscape, the downside is limited. With all due respect to British investor and mega-bear Jeremy Grantham, equity markets are not going down 45% from current levels.  The role of cryptocurrencies in the new normal  Let’s circle back to cryptocurrencies. They are a risk asset, as defined by their volatility. In the long run (the next three to seven years), I expect them to become uncorrelated to other asset classes but if one looks at a chart of the Nasdaq and a chart of bitcoin over the past two years, they look markedly similar. Bitcoin is 13 years old, still in its infancy, and is currently considered by investors as an allocation to technology. Yet, bitcoin as discussed is, at its essence, digital gold: a store of value for the world.  In this newly inflationary world I believe bitcoin is the ultimate disinflationary asset, and it is the “hardest” money that exists. It is independent of the monetary policies of fiat printing nations. Its value is derived by its fixed, limited supply, and by demand which, with a current estimated user base of 150 million to 200 million people globally, is still tiny and growing in a world of 8 billion.  Ether, another disinflationary crypto asset, can be thought of as digital oil: a blockchain of blockchains whose use case is a building block for the decentralized world to come. Think of Ethereum as Legos, a toy that became a builder’s model. As decentralized finance (DeFi) grows, as the world of non-fungible tokens (NFT) expands and as the metaverse becomes more real, Ethereum will likely be the base layer of that geometric growth.  The bottom line  I do not expect stocks to sell off meaningfully from here and, by implication, I don’t think cryptocurrencies will see an accelerated sell-off from current prices. Part of my confidence is based on the concept that there’s too much money chasing investment returns, and as said, there are a limited number of places to put it.  Gold and commodities should perform well if one expects an inflationary spiral, but my expectations are that those fears are overdone. The balance of my confidence comes from a deep understanding that bitcoin is the ultimate safe harbor in a world of unsustainable debt. We are living in “The Roaring Twenties” and the global powers that be will do everything they can to maintain that perception.  I believe we have another two to five years before the emperor is exposed, although uncertainties such as Russia and Ukraine, China and Taiwan and the South China Sea, North Korea and Iran do keep intruding on our collective peaceful sleep.  Bitcoin, ether and much of the cryptocurrency ecosystem are a long-term buy and hold for my portfolio. DeFi is an exciting and unstoppable force, and in my opinion is Traditional Finance 2.0. This $1.7 trillion asset class (down from $3 trillion two months ago) is here to stay.  Remain open minded and inquisitive, and HODL on.

Do not click links outside of opensea.io.”  Around 10:50 p.m. ET, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer followed up in a tweet that “32 users thus far have signed a malicious payload from an attacker, and some of their NFTs were stolen.” He added that the company is “not aware of any recent phishing emails that have been sent to users,” and suggested a fraudulent website may be to blame.  OpenSea had planned to revise its smart contract (the code governing its trading platform, essentially) by releasing a brand-new contract on Friday. The upgraded contract was intended to ensure old, inactive listings on the platform would eventually expire.  On Twitter, traders shared what they’d initially thought were official OpenSea emails about the migration process from contract A to contract B.  PeckShield, a blockchain security company that audits smart contracts, stated that the rumored exploit was “most likely phishing” – a malicious contract hidden in a disguised link. The company cited that same mass email about the migration process as one of the possible sources of the link.  The apparent attacker’s address (which the blockchain explorer website Etherscan has already slapped with a “phish/hack” warning badge) holds about $1.7 million worth of ether (ETH), as well as three tokens from the Bored Ape Yacht Club, two Cool Cats, one Doodle and one Azuki.
