42432758,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1XBh,1601510068,Twitter's Dorsey Calls Out Coinbase CEO for Ignoring Users' 'Societal Issues',"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted his disapproval of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong steering his company away from corporate activism.    Armstrong wrote in an open letter published Sunday that Coinbase had ""an apolitical culture,"" and that the exchange would not engage in ""broader societal issues"" or entertain employee discussions about it.  After the letter, Armstrong circulated a company-wide memo informing Coinbase employees that if they did not like the policy they could take a ""generous"" severance package instead.  Twitter CEO Dorsey responded that by the very act of being a crypto exchange, Coinbase was already activist by definition and there's no point in pretending otherwise.  ""Bitcoin (aka 'crypto') is direct activism against an unverifiable and exclusionary financial system which negatively affects so much of our society. Important to at least acknowledge and connect the related societal issues your customers face daily. This leaves people behind,"" Dorsey tweeted.  The back and forth comes at a time when tensions in the U.S. are boiling over with COVID-19, civil unrest and now a heated presidential race between incumbent President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.

42432755,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1Wzh,1601504986,Judge Rules Kik's Token Sale Violated US Securities Law,"A U.S. judge ruled Wednesday that Kik violated securities law when it raised $100 million via a token sale in 2017.      Judge Alvin Hellerstein, a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New York, wrote that in his view, Kik's ""token distribution event"" (TDE) satisfied the three prongs of the Howey Test, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court case used as a standard for determining whether the sale of something is a securities sale.      The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which filed the suit against Kik last year, had maintained the messaging platform's Kin token sale was an unregistered securities offering, while Kik claimed it was not.      ""Kik concedes that its issuance of Kin through the TDE involved an investment of money by which participants purchased or acquired Ether and exchanged Ether for Kin. Thus, the parties agree that the first element of the Howey test is satisfied,"" he said in the 19-page ruling. ""The parties dispute whether the second and third elements are satisfied. I hold that that they are.""      Initial coin offerings (ICOs) and token sales have been treated as unregistered securities sales for the most part by the SEC, which has filed suits against numerous startups and companies, including Telegram, another messaging company that raised a mammoth $1.7 billion.      Many of these cases use Howey, which says something might be a security if there is an investment of money in a common enterprise, with the expectation of profit, primarily from the efforts of others.      Judge Hellerstein wrote Wednesday that Kik ""extolled Kin's profit-making potential,"" satisfying one of the prongs, and that Kik ""pooled proceeds from its sales of Kin in an effort to create an infrastructure for Kin, and thus boost the value of the investment.""      This satisfies another prong, he said.      Read more: The SEC Case Against Kik's ICO Appears Strong, Experts Say      In a statement, Kik CEO Ted Livingston said he was ""disappointed in this ruling,"" and that the company is considering its options, including a potential appeal.      ""To be clear, Kik has always supported the Commission's goal of protecting investors, and we take compliance seriously,"" he said. ""In preparing for the sale of Kin, Kik retained sophisticated counsel (both in the United States and internationally) to analyze the law as we understood it, and we continue to believe that the public sale of Kin was that of a functional currency and not a sale of securities.""      Livingston added that the ruling would not impact kin.

42432757,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1X1h,1601503233,Prospective Node Operators Stake $125M in ETH to Participate in NuCypher Encryption Network,"Encryption startup NuCypher has finished distributing its network’s native token, NU, to over 2,000 prospective node operators who staked more than $125 million worth of ether (ETH) during the month of September. NuCypher's system will hit Ethereum's mainnet on Oct. 15.      Primarily marketed as a solution for developers building decentralized applications (dapps), NuCypher helps firms encrypt data before they upload it to decentralized storage networks, while also retaining control over who can read the data once its uploaded (using an advanced form of flexible cryptography called proxy re-encryption).      On the other side, participants who run the network’s nodes earn fees in return for performing cryptographic functions and maintaining the network. To participate, nodes need to stake NuCypher's token, NU. The company needed a way to distribute NU to entities it might reasonably expect to participate once it goes live, and the solution it came up with was called “WorkLock.”      Under NuCypher’s WorkLock token distribution program, participants looking to run nodes were required to lock in a minimum of 5 ether (worth roughly $2,000 depending on when the ETH was committed). It also requires the staked ETH stay locked for a minimum of six months, starting the day the mainnet launches. The onerous collateral requirement levied on aspirant node operators was meant to dissuade users from claiming NU tokens and not participating in the network.      While participants can choose to stay or leave with their escrowed ETH after the six months pass, if they attempt to withdraw earlier or act maliciously, they would have to forfeit the staked ETH.

42423975,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2j3fh,1601500829,"Thirst Traps Explode on NFT Platforms, With Predictably Controversial Results","Sexy selfies and feminist GIFs are selling like hotcakes on non-fungible token (NFT) markets, but not everyone is thrilled about this trend.  Blockade Games co-founder Marguerite deCourcelle, who sold more than $160,000 worth of NFTs before the NFT craze really kicked off in August 2020, launched a cypherpunk self-portrait NFT in early September and said she intends to explore more “personal tokens” over the next year.  “I brought in about $20,000 in a month. I haven’t really focused on selling personal NFTs as a part of my business model,” deCourcelle said.  She marketed the campaign with photos of herself, portraits that clearly required styling and editing skills, which predictably attracted trolls and harassment on social media. Some trolls suggested models can’t be trusted, the infamous temptress trope, comparing deCourcelle to beauty queen Jessica VerSteeg, who is being charged with fraud. But deCourcelle wasn’t deterred.  “The bitcoiners that see me with a personal token are outraged that I’m … selling a scam with ‘my good looks.’ Most of my supporters and fans enjoy that I’m so front and center,” she said in an interview. “It brings more transparency as I try to be more personable and engaging.”  Read more: The Inevitable Marriage of Yield Farming and NFTs, Explained  She said haters suggest she must choose to either be a model/influencer or a developer/designer, as if she couldn’t be both. Like many different types of influencers, crypto influencers often market by modeling, which plays out across social media instead of fashion magazines and runways.  For example, Rachel “CryptoFinally” Siegel collaborated with a variety of artists using Rarible in September to issue dozens of NFTs inspired by her selfies. She said one of her NFTs sold for hundreds of dollars worth of crypto, 1 ETH, and another of her NFTs is a lingerie photo titled “I’m in it for the money,” listed for $3,614 worth of ETH.  Siegel said she hasn’t cashed out any of her earnings yet. Instead, she uses them to mint new NFTs, buy collectibles from other artists and pay for other types of transactions. Many of these pieces are complex images, not simple selfies, all using her general vibe and features.  “The selfies are representative of new demographics starting to enter [the NFT market],” Siegel said.  Some crypto-savvy women are now using NFTs to profit from their public image, selling to fans who understand they’re basically paying a tribute to the creator in exchange for a blockchain-based receipt. If sex workers can sell bathwater or socks, and podcasters can sell stickers, why can’t crypto influencers sell blockchain receipts?  In response to the haters, who call these women vain and accuse them of harming the industry, Siegel tweeted: “if my selfies alone have the power to destroy crypto then honestly let it burn boys lmao let it burn.”  Gendered markets  While some women find new conduits for artistic expression in NFT markets, others are dismayed to find their images used by strangers.  For example, the web developer and painter who goes by Ashtoshi said her bikini selfie was put up for auction via Rarible, without her consent, for over $1,051 worth of crypto.  Although it may be unlawful for a stranger to profit from her misappropriated image, depending on the source, Ashtoshi herself struggled to get support from the platform to sell her art. She’s one of the critics who thinks selfie NFTs are silly.  “While, of course, my pictures were posted publicly on my Twitter, to have them taken from my page and then attempt to be sold with promises of ‘writing a person’s name on my boobs,’ etc., is a bit unsettling,” Ashtoshi said in an interview. “It’s unfortunate because I did ask to be verified on Rarible the same day I posted my art – but it never happened.”  Read more: The Fast-Growing NFT Market Is Problematic Yet Promising  Women in the crypto community don’t have a choice whether people will attempt to profit from their sexuality. They only have (limited) legal options to fight it like a cat-and-mouse game. This is a tale as old as time, where predominately male circles demean women profiting from their own image as the artist and owner, rather than the passive muse. As a painter who did not want to sell sexy selfies, Ashtoshi said she was disappointed by this dynamic.  “I won’t be posting anything else on Rarible or using the platform for anything from here on out,” Ashtoshi said. “While the idea of NFTs is super fascinating, I think there absolutely has to be some type of verification measures put in place to guarantee that what you are purchasing is an authentic piece of art.”  Ironically, a blockchain receipt only proves authenticity if the artist (or trading platform) invests legal resources to defend personal brands. No one suggests male influencers “deserve” to have selfies misappropriated, the way women are slut-shamed for selfies taken from Twitter. Some might say the self-portrait NFT trend is part of a wider push by feminist crypto fans to de-stigmatize self-sovereignty, especially with regards to the female body.  Read more: 'Crypto Instagram' Is Becoming a Thing, Scams and All  Crypto-savvy artists including Kitty Bast, Kamil Juaregui and Caroline Dy blur the lines between evocative portraits and digital collectibles.  Ashtoshi said she wished she had posted her painting NFTs anonymously, to avoid her debacle. Other artists use anonymity to court controversy, such as the team called ButerinSisters (after Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin). They made a clitoris GIF NFT for roughly $54, which was traded by several collectors. ButerinSisters said they met other feminists in the space by promoting this NFT, and hope to playfully educate a few men as well.  “We are feminists and when we discovered the Rarible platform we realized that there were mostly creations made by men and for men, it seemed interesting to us to show feminine creations,” ButerinSisters said in an interview. “We want to use the web 3.0 technology to fight [the patriarchy] and develop feminists representations with decentralized infrastructure, which cannot be censored. … Anatomy is political.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/30/thirst-traps-explode-on-nft-platforms-with-predictably-controversial-results,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d74767de19532c1d24edea1a8822671f31edb72d-1298x1088.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,701 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.27% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,657-$10,859  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price dipped down to as low as $10,657 Wednesday, bouncing into the $10,800 range and settling to $10,701 as of press time.      Read More: BitcoinACKs Lets You Track Bitcoin Development and Pay Coders for Work      Jason Lau, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, said that while bitcoin wasn’t able to hit fresh 2020 highs in September, he’s optimistic the cryptocurrency can still push upward heading into the fourth quarter of 2020. ""Bitcoin's price momentum is still positive, with its pullbacks leaving higher highs,” Lau told CoinDesk. “This is signalling a possible further continuation of this upwards move.”      Quantitative trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a September-capping investor note that bitcoin and ether were able to stay above “key” price points for the month, which it sees as a pragmatic sign. “The key support from the early month lows of $10,000 on BTC and $310 on ETH both saw substantial buying demand,” QCP wrote. “This prevented any cascading short gamma selling into quarter-end, which had been our fear if those levels broke.”      Constantin Kogan, partner at cryptocurrency fund-of-funds BitBull Capital, noted a jump in the number of new entities on the Bitcoin network, its highest level since October 2018, as a sign of positive sentiment. New unique addresses in Bitcoin are described by data aggregator Glassnode as “entities that appeared for the first time in a transaction of the native coin in the network.”      “We're seeing a spike in activity by new participants coming into BTC not yet reflected in price. It doesn't happen often,” Kogan told CoinDesk regarding the new entities metric. “This is what traders call a divergence; in this case the trend looks more bullish.”      Over in the bitcoin futures market, funding rates are now mostly in positive territory on major derivatives venues. This is a reversal from the past week and a sign bullish traders are again entering the market, according to OKCoin’s Lau.      “Bitcoin perpetual swaps funding rates have started turning positive,” Lau told CoinDesk. “This indicates that investors are more willing to go long at current price levels.”    DeFi crosses $11 billion locked    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Wednesday trading around $355 and slipping 0.32% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The amount of cryptocurrency “locked” or held in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, topped $11 billion on Tuesday, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse.      Almost 20% of the total locked is in decentralized exchange Uniswap, which despite declining volumes topped $2.29 billion in total liquidity on Tuesday. Alessandro Andreotti, a cryptocurrency over-the-counter trader based in Italy, said that although the DeFi market may be cooling since June’s explosion of protocol token launches, its ascension will continue - although perhaps at not so fast a pace.

42432773,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1XXh,1601495136,Election 2020 Prediction Markets: Bettors Say Trump Lost Tuesday's Debate,"With the first Trump–Biden debate now smoldering behind us, the betting markets have picked their winner. That also means they've decided on a loser: President Donald Trump.      Tuesday marked the first time the incumbent squared off face-to-face against his rival, Democratic nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden. The two septuagenarians bickered, insulted, belittled and at times screamed at one another at almost regular intervals, all in hopes of convincing the American public each is the best choice to control the world’s largest deployed nuclear arsenal.      And while conventional, real-time polling may have been unavailable during the roughly hour and a half Trump and Biden squabbled, bets were furiously being made over whom the markets believe will be the person running the U.S. for the next four years.      So why turn to the so-called predictions markets, where people bet on the outcomes of major events? The theory goes something like this: Those willing to risk their capital provide more accurate information about expectations than those who merely answer a survey. Money talks, as they say.    Trump’s rough night on PredictIt    On PredictIt, a prediction market run by New Zealand’s Victoria University of Wellington, the volume of “shares” on the question “Who will win the 2020 U.S. presidential election?” saw its highest-ever day on Tuesday, coming in at about 708,500.      Bettors buy “shares” in a candidate. When a candidate wins, the payoff is $1 per share; everyone who bet on someone else goes home with nothing. Besides being centralized, PredictIt is also regulated in the United States.      Shares of “Trump” started off the debate trading at around 46 cents, roughly where they had been for much of the month. Early in the debate, as it quickly heated up, buyers began growing a little more optimistic on Trump’s prospects, with shares rising to as high as 48 cents. However, they closed the hour back at 46 cents after roughly 46,000 shares traded hands. Just seven hours before, fewer than 5,000 shares were traded.      As the night wore on and the debate took a turn for the weird, if not troubling, sellers came in where they could, taking prices down to as low as 42 cents, more or less where it was at press time.      Read more: Prediction Markets’ Time Has Come, but They Aren’t Ready for It      Meanwhile, Joe Biden’s shares remained more or less in the 59-cent range during the debate. However, some 39,700 shares were traded. Considering the higher price, that’s a couple of thousand dollars more in volume. Biden’s stock has since been on an upswing, as high as 63 cents as this article was published.      Given the nature of this election, there were a few trades for the nominees’ running mates.      Some 40,000 shares of Kamala Harris were traded between 3 cents and 5 cents during the debates. A buyer or several buyers, perhaps speculating the GOP would want to or need to change the top of their ticket, bought nearly 100,000 shares of Mike Pence at the for between 1 cent and 2 cents.    Florida, man    The American election, of course, isn’t a one-horse race. Rather, it is 51 separate elections for sets of electors from each state and the District of Columbia. And that’s where some of the more interesting price movements have been taking place.      On Wednesday, bettors changed their minds about Florida, moving the Sunshine State from Republican at 52 cents to Democrat at 51 cents. Like presidential shares, state races also pay $1 to the winner and nothing to the loser.      That compounds trouble on the electoral map for Trump, who is seeing traditional southern Republican states like North Carolina and Arizona come into play. Wagers also appear confident Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania – the three states crucial in Trump’s 2016 victory – will switch to the Democrats.      The moves now give the Democrats a likely 335 votes in the Electoral College, up from 306 several hours before. This puts PredictIt’s numbers close to Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight.com’s prediction that Biden will capture 332 electoral votes. Candidates require 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.    Down the ticket    Bets on the Senate haven’t been kind to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, either.      Gamblers now see the Democrats picking up enough seats to downgrade the longtime Kentucky Republican senator to Chuck Schumer’s (D-N.Y.) current office as Minority Leader, assuming Republicans in the upper chamber decide to keep him at their helm even if they lose control. According to PredictIt, Democrats will start the next session with 51 senators, picking up states including Arizona, North Carolina and Maine.    Decentralized markets confirm    While PredictIt is a centralized market, more blockchain-friendly exchanges also have bad news for Team Trump.      To be sure, they are smaller in size than others but offer more tailored questions. And since this is an anything-goes election, such bespoke contracts may help those who need to hedge for some reason or else just want to take on an enticing bet. After all, whether Trump will concede the election should he lose remains a mystery.      For example, Augur, the most well-known decentralized prediction market, offers one contract on “Will Donald J. Trump win the 2020 U.S. Presidential election?” expiring Jan. 20, 2021. Another one – “Will Donald Trump win the 2020 U.S. Presidential election?” – expires Jan. 7, 2021. “Who will win the 2020 U.S. Presidential election?” expires on Dec. 7, 2020.      In the first two, a “yes” contract (that Trump wins) is at 49%. In the last one, Trump is at 40% to Biden’s 54%. Presumably, the 6% is an unknown factor which, in 2020, is entirely possible.      Polymarket has bettors pricing a Trump win at 46 cents though briefly Tuesday night, it was as high as 52 cents. Just $100,000 worth of contracts have traded on that contract since it began three months ago. PredIQt on the EOS blockchain gives the president nearly the same odds, trading at 45%. Omen, which prices its contracts in DAI, gives Biden a 58.8% chance of winning.      FTX, a market that doesn’t just trade crypto derivatives, also has a market on various election-related contracts. Traders there are also bearish on Trump.      Trump’s “futures contract” on FTX had a rapid sell-off just as the debates came to a close. Prices fell to 40 cents from 43.5 cents on volume of 57,000 contracts. Back in February, it traded as high as 65.2 cents before crashing to as low as 31.8 cents in the midst of the March 12 market crash. It rebounded to 50 cents until June, it began trending lower.      Biden’s price got a boost at about the same moment, albeit on smaller size. His contract on FTX rose to 60.4 cents from 55.5 cents on 10,000 contracts just as the debate commentators were shaking their heads on-air in disbelief at the spectacle they had just witnessed.      Of course, prices fluctuate every day.      Facts change and, as this is 2020, sometimes get invented, too.      Thus what’s true at the time of publication can change on a dime. It is now fewer than five weeks until Election Day. Buckle up!

42432770,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1XTh,1601487725,What Happens if Big Tech Only Gets Bigger?,"Amy Webb, a quantitative futurist and founder of the strategic foresight firm Future Today Institute, thinks the world can, indeed, get worse.      In her most recent book “2020 Tech Trend Report: Strategic Trends that Will Influence Business, Government, Education, Media and Society in the Coming Year,” Webb examines the companies – and the people who run them – that will make the future either a utopia or a new hell.      Webb’s major idea centers around how the G-MAFIA (an invective and acronym of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, IBM and Apple) and its Chinese counterpart in BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent) are becoming increasingly interwoven in our lives.      Digital innovations – from artificial intelligence to payments architectures – are not in themselves dangerous. But decisions made today to serve political or shareholder interests, rather than the public good, could destabilize our shared future.    This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series.    She's not the only one who sees a dystopian AI arising from the ether, nor the only person to think the G-MAFIA and BAT exert outsized influence over society and politics. However, despite technological revolts and regulatory hamstringing, she admits these companies are not going anywhere.      CoinDesk corresponded with Webb over email. The conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.      What do you suppose will happen to the ""G-MAFIA"" in a decade? Will they continue to consolidate power and if so, what happens to the rest of the internet?      The G-MAFIA will continue to consolidate power. Even if antitrust measures pass in the United States, and that's a big if, it's unlikely the companies will accept the findings of the investigations and agree to be broken apart.      So the question is really about how do the G-MAFIA evolve? Amazon, Google and Apple are making bold, decisive moves into health care. From Amazon's Halo wristband to Apple Fitness+ to Google's acquisition of Fitbit, big tech players are working now to collect and analyze our health data.      See also: Zephyr Teachout: Take Back the Economy From Economists      But those are just devices you wear on your wrist – what about the biometric detection algorithms that mine, refine and optimize us? Or the move into electronic health data and records? And insurance in the case of Amazon, and outpatient care in the case of Apple's employee clinics?      If we zoom out, big tech getting into health care is just one of many areas where we're seeing disruptive change happening at a relatively fast clip. Microsoft is building the future of smart agriculture. Facebook is, as you know very well, working on the future of cryptos and DLTs. IBM is always ignored, but it's making important strides in open enterprise architecture for AI.      They're all vying for cloudshare. Power will be consolidated in a way that will be difficult to see if you're not intentionally gathering data and working to connect dots across products, services and industries. They are amassing more power and influence than our governments.      What might the cultural or political effects be of an ever-greater consolidated and extractive web?      We talk about privacy a lot, and journalists certainly write a lot of stories about data sharing, privacy and consolidation within the tech sector. But when it comes to everyday consumers and business leaders, it just doesn't seem like these are priority issues. We'll feel the effects when there is litigation, new policy or sweeping policy enacted.      You write about the tech giants of America and China as competitive and cooperative forces. What do you expect will happen to the “splinternet” – will the divide between east and west grow wider?      Unfortunately, with China's provocative moves to achieve cyber sovereignty, we're going to see a deeper splinternet.      See also: China Aims to Be the World’s Dominant Blockchain Power – With Help From Google, Amazon and Microsoft      There are greater forces at play here. China's Belt and Road Initiative, which swaps infrastructure development in emerging markets for debt, could lead to BRI countries being coerced into using the Chinese internet rather than the existing internet, which to be fair relies on data transfer for monetization.      Projects like Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid are an interesting example of emerging decentralized approaches to the web, applications and data use. Similarly, I think we'll see more distributed networks like Golem and Morpheus.      But it will take a long time for Web 3.0 initiatives to move from the fringes to the mainstream.      Do you see a genuine way out through distributed technologies that may give people control over their own data?      I worry about people who never update their passwords – should we entrust them to manage sensitive data? There are complex questions about data hygiene, data governance, compliance, risk. Distributed tech solutions solve some of our problems, but not all.      Few people have an understanding of how data are collected, by whom, for what purpose. There are lots of organizations proposing some kind of ""ownership"" model, where we individually would ""own"" our data. What does that mean?      I want consumers to be much better aware of what data they are generating – that includes the digital emissions they're releasing without realizing it. Think of all the metadata being generated by our connected devices, the ambient sounds in our homes and offices, our movements and gestures. All of those digital emissions, plus the PIIs collected now by contract tracing apps and biometric scanning systems – I mean, we're swimming in data.      How can we become better at predicting the future?      As a futurist I'll be the first person to tell you that I can't predict the future. The math doesn't work out. If I'm dealing with a limited quantity of variables, then yes, I might be able to make a prediction. The reason we're continually surprised is because we're only thinking tactically about what matters right now, or we're thinking fancifully about the deeper future. The hard work is finding signals in the present and modeling their next-order impacts using data and rigorous frameworks. Predictions are brittle. The goal of any good futurist is preparation.      See also: Don Tapscott – A New Social Contract for the Digital Age      The question really is: How can we reduce uncertainty? We should all try to get better at confronting cherished beliefs and accepting chaos and chance as drivers of change. Ultimately, strategic foresight isn’t about making predictions. It’s about creating a state of readiness and knowing when to act. This includes being ready for a sudden chaotic event, like a natural disaster or a global pandemic. The best strategic foresight work results in insights, internal alignment, and faster, data-driven decision-making. I like to use a flywheel analogy. With some pushing and persistent effort, the effect is a reduction in surprise and uncertainty.      I do not believe in “Black Swan” events, which are unpredictable events that come as a total surprise and have severe consequences. Nothing is truly instantaneous. When people talk about the pandemic as a “Black Swan” event, they are wrong. The virus emerged, governments made poor choices, and now we’re dealing with the aftermath.

The brainchild of Pierre Rochard, BitcoinACKs aggregates pull requests for protocol improvements from the Bitcoin Core GitHub (in coder vernacular, “ACK” means that a proposal or change passes muster), CoinDesk tech reporter Colin Harper writes.      BitcoinACKs’ crowdfunding mechanism is a first in Bitcoin’s open-source landscape. Before, you could sponsor individual developers, but you couldn’t directly fund individual upgrades.      Usually, open-source funding has been the realm of cryptocurrency exchanges or other Bitcoin-related companies. These actors will often offer six-figure lump-sum grants to independent developers to fund their work.      “BitcoinACKs is for funding targeted, specific outcomes. For example, perhaps your business needs a specific API feature, rather than asking for favors or hiring full-time contributors, it’s more convenient to put a bounty on it,” Rochard said.      The website has been around for a couple of years, but Rochard just rolled out a new feature: a pledge option that allows users to commit funding to a specific protocol improvement and pay developers once that improvement is merged into Bitcoin Core.      These pledges can be paid out via Lightning or on-chain payments processed through BTCPay Server.    Market intel    Sushi’s spoils?

After hitting an all-time high of $1.4 billion total value locked (TVL) on September 12, Sushi's TVL fell by two-thirds to nearly $490 million just a week later. It has declined a further $130 million to $354 million in the past nine days.    Op-ed    See, saw, cycles Jill Carlson, co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, writes about the cycles of “token” exuberance and actual development in the crypto industry. “There has emerged a pattern of fluctuation back and forth between innovation in crypto assets, discovering the challenges, turning to build blockchain infrastructure, running into roadblocks there and back. Before long (and perhaps sooner than I anticipate) we will see this pendulum of interest swing back from infrastructure to innovation around assets themselves,” she writes.

42384852,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlV7t,1601477861,'Great Artists Steal' – What Enterprise Blockchain Can Learn From the Past,"For as long as there have been computers in enterprises, there have been people working on how to make machine-to-machine commerce a reality. While the world of blockchain is only now embracing smart contracts for enterprise usage, programmable, machine-to-machine commerce has been around since the 1970s.      I started thinking about the power and value of this very old ecosystem when I was asked a question by a member of the EY developer team: What data should go in a blockchain purchase order token? The answer is already out there. It’s been out there for 50 years. There is no need to reinvent the wheel (or the purchase order).      In 1950, all the countries in the world exported a combined total of $61 billion in goods. In 1970, that number had risen 500% to nearly $320 billion. The world’s paper-based systems for trade and logistics were already close to the breaking point.    Paul Brody is a Principal and Global Blockchain Leader at EY.    The need for some kind of digital automation was urgent. Different global industry groups started to put together standards for digitizing commerce, of which the most important came to be known as the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).      The EDI compressed the typical interactions that companies have with each other into standardized digital messages. The result was, over time, a standardized way for companies to interact online.      Ask a supply chain executive how they think about operations, and many of them can respond in a sequence of EDI message standards: 850 for purchase orders, 856 for shipment notices, 846 to confirm receipt and 810 for invoice message.      When matched with the emerging digital financial standards promoted by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), it was possible to build a fully digital, global supply chain in the 1970s. The SWIFT standards emerged in the world of banking at nearly the same time as EDI, and the result was something that looked very close to smart contracts, including digital payment execution to close the loop.      See also: SWIFT Gives Blockchain Platforms Access to 'Instant' GPI Payments Following R3 Trial    Let’s learn from and seize the insights available from decades of digital commerce to build for the future.    Despite all the analog gaps, SWIFT and EDI are used to manage more than $19 trillion worth of cross-border trade, dwarfing any blockchain solution currently out there. But blockchain will get there. And it will get there by learning from and adopting these core technologies, rather than trying to re-invent all of them.      The world of blockchain has tended to focus a great deal on SWIFT and international payments. The reality is that trade and finance go hand-in-hand, and to scale the world’s blockchains, we need to start taking more pages from the enterprise commerce playbook. Financial systems are not just about moving money; they are about moving money to pay for products, services and investments in infrastructure.      If SWIFT is the language of money, EDI is the language of industry, and they go together. But they both have issues that blockchain can solve.      EDI is not very standardized. There are, in fact, numerous different standards in use. Further, both EDI and SWIFT are essentially limited to point-to-point messages (a significant issue in an era when most commerce spans multiple companies). And they are not designed to execute business logic: That must all be done outside the system, meaning none of the logic can easily span shared business environments.      The result is a system that has scaled enormously well, but within the constraints of a very narrow set of capabilities. Even simple rules-based interactions like having a supplier send a truck to replace a product when it runs low is not easy to implement, since that requires multiple parties – the buyer, the seller and a logistics partner – with shared business rules that require them to keep track of things like inventory levels.      In the world of blockchain, there is an immense opportunity to build a truly integrated system. Within blockchain-based systems, we can call upon many different participants and shared business logic. We can also seamlessly manage the transfer of goods and services as well as the integration of payments because value, data and assets are just different kinds of tokens.      See also: Paul Brody – Enterprises Would Use DeFi, if It Weren't so Public      The fastest way for us to get to that future promised land is to learn our history. So much of this work has been done before, from purchase orders to payment systems. Instead of dismissing the systems that have worked so well for decades, we should copy and improve.

42384848,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlV2r,1601477746,CBDCs Could Challenge US Dollar's Dominance: Deutsche Bank,"Geopolitical jostling accelerated by large-scale private stablecoin initiatives like libra, plus an added dose of COVID-19, means we are now facing a perfect storm for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).      Such tectonic shifts are being acknowledged by big players like Deutsche Bank, the latest lender to issue a report on CBDCs and their looming impact.      The report, while quite conservative, recognizes the global financial system is in a state of exponential flux. For example, within only a decade of Bitcoin’s arrival, China has begun testing a CBDC in four major cities.      “The e-RMB and the Belt and Road Initiative would give China a chance to increase the importance of that currency overall,” Gerit Heinz, Deutsche Bank’s chief investment strategist, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “That could also imply some changes in the global reserve system.”      Challenging the marriage of convenience between the global financial system and the U.S. dollar may be the technology’s ultimate impact.      “CBDC has the potential to challenge the primacy of the U.S. dollar,” Heinz said.      It’s perhaps no surprise this potential decoupling is being driven hardest of all by China, the anchor of a region that holds half the world’s foreign exchange reserves, not to mention some of the niftiest digital payments infrastructure.    Whither Europe?    So what’s Europe’s position in this digital currency cold war? Earlier this month, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said at a conference in Germany that Europe has fallen behind the competition when it comes to CBDCs.      A digital euro, which would not replace cash but complement it, is needed to keep Europe at the cutting edge of innovation and to provide an alternative to private digital currency initiatives like libra, Lagarde added in a speech last week.      Read more: Digital Euro Would Provide Alternative to Cryptos, ECB President Lagarde Says      The CBDC race is being run on uneven ground, however. Deutsche’s Heinz pointed out that in a democratic system, governments would have to take time to explain these developments to their people. “And people would probably want to have a say in this, although probably to varying degrees in different countries,” he said, adding:      “In Europe, I would expect a lot of discussions about this. The euro introduced as a currency decades ago has triggered a lot of discussions. So CBDC in a euro system of different countries would, of course, imply much more discussion than in a bigger, more centralized country like China.”      Stepping back, the Deutsche Bank report reminds us that changes to the dominant global reserve currency are a historical recurrence. “The pound was more important in the past and then the dollar took over; the petro-dollar and the fact that commodities are traded in dollars is one reason,” said Heinz.      The difference today is that it’s not just the dominance of the dollar, it’s the dominance of U.S.-centric infrastructure and technology in payment systems, said Rashid Hoosenally, CEO of Lacero, a builder of infrastructure connecting digital assets to regular businesses.      “I think that in the CBDC story, there is potentially an evolution to a more distributed version of that power, something that looks more like a global consortium rather than being overly centered around any one country or economic bloc,” said Hoosenally. “If that also leads to more harmonization of regulation and technology standards, that could bring huge financial and social benefits by making the system much more efficient.”    Loveless marriage    As such, CBDC could be the next front in a technology-based cold war, which has included things like the Google tax, and in which regard it’s not at all surprising to find that Europe appears to be more outraged than anyone over Facebook’s libra plans.      (It’s also interesting to note that Europe’s broad proposals for its digital finance future, which include a framework for the regulation of all digital assets, also aims at gaining some kind of oversight of U.S. cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and IBM Cloud.)      Read more: Leaked EU Draft Proposes All-Encompassing Laws for Crypto Assets      On the banking side of things, there are some who even see CBDC as a possible revenge catalyst for putatively protectionist policies introduced by the U.S. post-2008.      “I’m not sure I would call it a ‘war’ or a ‘battle’ because I think really what central banks are doing is responding to what's going on in the economy,” said Gary Smith, founder of Sovereign Focus, a consultancy based in London.      However, Smith did refer to the arrangement regarding America and Europe, as well as many other places as something of a loveless marriage, citing as an example U.S.-imposed sanctions on Iran.      “The U.S. walked away from the Iran agreement. Europe hasn’t and would like to do some trade with Iran, but they are being bullied by the U.S. Treasury,” said Smith. “So having an alternative payment system that Europe can use without falling foul of the U.S. Treasury is something that probably has some appeal.”      Also last week, the International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA), a trade association with close ties to the European Commission, showed its support for the creation of a level playing field for digital assets in Europe, by stating in a blog post:    “Europe is not just carving out its own place in the ‘tech cold war.’ It is seeking to rise above it with a cunning strategy.”    The situation regarding CBDCs on the global stage is not about being anti-American, or anti-Chinese, said Marc Taverner, INATBA’s executive director.      “What we are seeing is the tectonic plates shifting and a great opportunity around digital currencies and DLT,” Taverner said. “What Europe is aiming at is to be is a place for innovation.”      Read the full report:",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/30/cbdcs-could-challenge-us-dollars-dominance-deutsche-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37ea0dc352d583f8cffe608da6ad4493720e1ecb-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) told Salt Blockchain Inc., the owner of the lending platform that offers dollar-denominated loans collateralized by cryptocurrencies, that it would have to begin the process of offering refunds to investors.  It will have 14 days to issue a press release, announcing the order, on its website.  In a public letter, the SEC said Salt's ICO violated securities regulations by not registering the sale beforehand.  The SEC said the token counted as a security because Salt told investors they could expect to make a return on their investment.  Investors will have three months after the filing of a registration statement to submit a claim to Salt, which will be obligated to pay back their investment along with any agreed interest.  Salt has agreed to settle the action and will pay a $250,000 civil penalty to the Commission in the next 10 days.

42384855,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlVBf,1601472538,First Mover: Chainlink’s Sorry September Returns Shows DeFi Hysteria Deflating,"DeFi deflated.      That was the story in cryptocurrency markets in September as prices tumbled for digital tokens from “decentralized finance” (DeFi), the fast-evolving arena of blockchain-based lending and trading platforms.      Chainlink, which supplies data feeds to DeFi systems, saw its LINK token fall 42% month to date, the worst return among digital assets in the CoinDesk 20.      The DeFi market correction came at a time when traditional markets also were hit hard by growing anxiety over the increasingly contentious U.S. presidential elections in November and resurgent coronavirus cases in the U.S. and Europe, according to Anil Lulla, co-founder of the cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital.      It was a reality check after DeFi’s ebullient August during which traders speculated that the emerging sector would reap fast revenue growth buoyed by well-received debuts of DeFi protocols. Tokens mooned from Aave's LEND to Yearn.Finance's YFI and Spaghetti's PASTA. Total collateral locked in DeFi rocketed to $9 billion at the end of August from $2 billion at the start of July. It is currently at $11 billion.      The slowing rate of growth in September translated to a sell-off in DeFi tokens.      “If you look at August, crypto came off probably with one of the best months of performance ever,” Lulla said. “So I don’t think it’s unusual to see a breakdown, a little dip like this.”      The DeFi tokens’ monthly swings were bigger than for bitcoin (BTC), which slid 7.9% in September, after a 2.6% rise in August.      Matthew Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, noted that LINK’s decline followed a 10-fold rise in the 12 months through August. The token is still the best-performing digital asset the CoinDesk 20, up 458% year-to-date.      “That’s the crypto shuffle,” Hougan told CoinDesk in an email. “I don’t think anything has fundamentally changed about the story or the investment case. The DeFi market got a little bit ahead of itself and now it’s resetting.”      CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reported Tuesday that some crypto traders are shifting funds from alternative tokens into bitcoin in a bet that the largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about $200 billion, might prove a better bet over the next several months. And CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported that data from the cryptocurrency options markets suggest that ether, the native token of the Ethereum network which serves as the backbone of DeFi, might start to take its cues from bitcoin’s price direction.      Bitcoin closed Tuesday at $10,836, setting a record of 65 consecutive daily closes above $10,000, the longest period in history.      The Norwegian crypto research firm Arcane Research also noted that the number of daily active addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain surged last week to its highest level since January 2018.      “This is a healthy sign and shows that the adoption and use of bitcoin is increasing,” the newsletter wrote.      - Muyao Shen    Bitcoin Watch    Cryptocurrency analysts are daring to venture into a categorization of bitcoin that would have been unthinkable a few years ago: That historically volatile bitcoin prices now be above $10,000 to stay.      ""It is safe to say that the leading cryptocurrency has established itself as a 5-digit cryptocurrency this year,"" the Norwegian digital-asset analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a weekly report.      Bitcoin has now had 65 consecutive daily closes above $10,000, a record, and over the past six days the largest cryptocurrency has stayed in a tight range between roughly $10,600 and $10,800.      Diginex's Matt Blom wrote Tuesday that he sees price-support levels at $10,500, with ""more solid support"" at $10,350. Barring that, the next level of $10,150 would likely be ""well defended by the bulls, should we reach it.""      So the logical question is whether prices can sustainably break above $11,00 and maintain that higher plateau.      ""Once the markets make up their mind direction-wise, we usually expect some sort of breakout from the short-term ranges,"" Greenspan wrote. ""None looks more ready for this than bitcoin right now.""      - Bradley Keoun    Token Watch    Yearn.finance (YFI): Governance deployment error that temporarily charged an additional fee of 5% for each withdrawal instead of the originally set 0.5% has been fixed.

42384850,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlV6d,1601470805,Energy Web Is Starting With Ripple in Its Bid to Make Crypto Provably Green,"The crypto industry, with its questionable carbon footprint, now has a convenient way to showcase its green cred on a verified (rather than trusted) basis.      But that raises a tricky question: The likes of Amazon and Google, whose processing largely takes place within directly owned and controlled data centers, are able to contract clean energy with relative ease and precision. But who do you ask for if you want to make Bitcoin greener?      Announced Wednesday, Energy Web, a non-profit focused on decentralized approaches to decarbonizing the grid, wants to show how a large blockchain platform can switch to a zero-carbon footprint. To start with, the organization is teaming up with San Francisco-based Ripple and the XRP Ledger Foundation.      Ripple’s support of this venture is intended to open the door to other blockchains with more energy-intensive operations like Bitcoin, said Jesse Morris, Energy Web’s chief commercial officer.      To make all this possible, the non-profit has released an open-source app called EW Zero that makes it easy for individuals, businesses or even entire blockchain ecosystems to make the transition. This initial deployment uses energy attribute certificates (EACs) from renewable energy sources to decarbonize electricity, the companies said.      “Blockchains are a massive energy hog and a lot of that electricity is not coming from wind, solar, hydro or other sustainable facilities,” said Morris. “So we have been thinking for a while now about how we could help the crypto industry decarbonize blockchains, given the distributed nature of the technology.”    First, Ripple    In the case of Ripple, a 500-person fintech company focused on crypto-powered banking, there is an obvious starting point when it comes to reducing the firm’s carbon footprint. Moreover, Ripple uses a consensus system quite unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining, an algorithm that by definition must burn through a ton of electricity. (At last count, the top five PoW blockchains currently use up to 170 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity per year – more than the state of New York.)      As such, bitcoin isn’t really comparable to something like pre-mined XRP running on Ripple, which many would argue comprises much more of a centralized system.      Presented with these observations, Ken Weber, Ripple’s head of social impact, said in this case it would be beneficial to put technology-based tribal differences aside and adopt more of an “all in this together” approach.      Read more: Can Bitcoin Survive the Climate Change Revolution?      “It’s early days for all these currencies, which right now have a tiny share of global finance, but further down the line [green energy adoption] is gonna be much more difficult to reverse engineer,” said Weber. “We wanted to help make it easy to adopt these practices. This is not a proprietary wish on Ripple’s part; it’s a whole system wish. As with other social change movements, the idea is not to make anybody feel bad or shamed, but to give them a means to do this that is reasonable, beneficial and participatory.”    Crypto ESG    Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, which identifies trends in cryptocurrencies, said carbon offsetting is happening at the level of crypto exchanges looking to do business with traditional financial institutions that follow environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) mandates.      “Ripple is leveraging the fact that people associate heavy energy consumption with blockchains, but that’s only really proof-of-work,” said de Vries. “With Bitcoin, you’re talking about an extreme carbon footprint of 300 kilograms per transaction. I haven’t done the math on Ripple, but it’s gonna be closer to a Visa transaction, which is 0.4 grams per transaction.”      Read more: Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global Warming      Nonetheless, this is a step in the right direction for a relatively young industry that could become one of the first to be carbon-neutral, said Energy Web’s Morris. In the same way that large corporates use certificates to decarbonize complex supply chains, blockchain users can purchase certificates from different places around the world (EW Zero also uses a blockchain system to track and account for these certificates).      “Imagine in the future having a wallet interacting with some blockchain, and as a part of that wallet you can actually increase your transaction fee just a bit and you’ve just contributed to decarbonizing the blockchain by purchasing a certificate somewhere,” said Morris. “Or if you are a bitcoin miner in a mining pool, you’re also able to use this application to directly purchase certificates in a specific part of the world.”      The impetus to give this is a go is two-fold, said Energy Web CEO Walter Kok.      “Firstly, on the supply side, it will be useful to hook up existing green energy producers already servicing Bitcoin, which might have an overcapacity of green energy,” Kok said, adding:    “The other part won’t happen overnight, but in the end, everybody wants to be assured they are contributing to a better world. So let’s get to the point where we can say with confidence that all blockchains, including Bitcoin and all its miners, produce in a green way.”",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | XRP,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/30/energy-web-is-starting-with-ripple-in-its-bid-to-make-crypto-provably-green,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b7770810b10899e9f7ddd3f584b9221cc6b51ff-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384854,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlVAP,1601468844,DeFi 'Vampire' SushiSwap Still Hemorrhaging Liquidity,"DeFi trading protocol SushiSwap, which threatened to sap the life out of rival Uniswap just two weeks ago, is still losing crucial liquidity.    Data from DeFi Pulse shows total value locked (TVL) in SushiSwap has dropped nearly 8% in the past 24 hours.  TVL represents the dollar value of the tokens locked into a protocol's smart contracts. While not universally accepted, it's generally considered a key success metric for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.  This is particularly true for automated market maker (AMM) exchanges, such as SushiSwap and Uniswap, which rely on users depositing tokens in order to provide liquidity and create the trading experience.  As such, Wednesday's figures don't make for good reading; SushiSwap has been on a near-uninterrupted decline since mid-September when its creator made off with, and then returned, the dev fund.  After hitting an all-time high of $1.4 billion on Sept. 12, Sushi's TVL fell by two-thirds to nearly $490 million just a week later.  While that rate of decline has shallowed, TVL has still fallen a further $130 million to $354 million in the past nine days.  Wednesday's drop of nearly $50 million is the biggest since TVL fell by $100 million on Sept. 21.  This marks a significant change in SushiSwap's fortunes, which just weeks ago looked to supersede Uniswap after it took $830 million in vital liquidity.  However, a $500 million UNI airdrop and concerns over SushiSwap's founder saw most of that liquidity bounce back to Uniswap.  Indeed, from just $430 million in TVL in mid-September, Uniswap has made a dramatic snapback, becoming the first protocol to break the $2 billion milestone this week.  In the past 24 hours, Uniswap's TVL has risen by approximately 2%.

It's the second fund created by Leshner's firm, Robot Ventures, and it has secured $4 million in funding, led by Galaxy Digital with additional participation by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam's Paradigm.      Scout funds act as seed investors but with ties to institutional funds, helping the larger entities get an early read on opportunities for later rounds.

""We can serve as the bridge.""      Chitra and Leshner bring complementary skill sets to the space. Leshner is the one who set up a DeFi company and brought it to a market-leading position. Tarun, as Leshner put it, ""is probably the lead quant within DeFi and has done a lot of the structuring of token distributions and economic analysis for probably every project you've heard of.""      Quipped Leshner: ""He's the brains, I'm the brawn.""      Chitra said DeFi today has a clear advantage over traditional high-end trading desks that won't even consider creating a derivative for less than millions of dollars. DeFi is cranking out new derivatives every day, completely upending the model. This is where big investors want to get some kind of exposure.

""I think [DeFi] will converge to a happy medium that replaces a lot of traditional investment banking functions.""      Other large operations might need to get in soon or miss out on an unusual moment.      ""When I started Compound there was like three things that would call themselves DeFi projects,"" Leshner said.

As reported by ABC News on Wednesday, the operation was an attempt to crack a complex scheme of terrorist funding said to have been masterminded by two French extremists who have been residing in northwestern Syria and have still not been apprehended.  The 29 people arrested across France for questioning are suspected of funding terrorist activities as part of an elaborate financing network.  Two of the 29 are suspected of being key in the cyber-financing system and for providing logistical aid to keep the network – active since last year – running.  The network was discovered by Tracfin, a French economy ministry that tracks fiscal fraud, terror financing and money laundering.  Hundreds of thousands of euros are suspected to have been supplied through the network benefiting members of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group still holding out in the region.  According to ABC's report, the network members in France purchased cryptocurrency coupons and transferred the details by secure messaging to jihadis in Syria.  The French prosecutor's office detailed that a score of people in France would regularly buy the coupons worth between €10 to €150 euros (US$11 to $165), which were credited to accounts opened by jihadis abroad and then cashed out on an exchange platform.  France initiated its investigation in January when Tracfin detected the Syrian network.

42384853,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlV99,1601460445,"Is Reddit’s MOON Token Really 2,000x Bigger Than the Global Economy?","A token for rewarding content on a specific Reddit forum now has the unusual honor of being thousands of times bigger than the entire global economy ... kind of.      MOON, a community token for the r/Cryptocurrency subreddit, technically has a market cap of over $2.88 septillion (that's 24 zeroes) at press time. That dwarves the global economy that, as per data from the World Bank, came to approximately $133 trillion in 2019.      So on paper, a four-month old token, designed to reward good content on a subreddit, has ""mooned"" to become 2,000 times bigger than the value of everything else humanity has ever made, ever.      But before you start thinking the end is nigh, this astounding number is just a market quirk.      Built on Ethereum's Rinkeby testnet, MOON wasn't initially tradable on secondary markets, which made it difficult to pin down a price. But users soon devised a workaround.      See also: Reddit Seeks Scaling Solution for Ethereum-Based 'Community Points'      It works like this: MOON holders go to a site called xmoon.exchange and convert their tokens into xMOON – a type of derivative product. They can then trade these on HoneySwap – a type of automated market maker exchange similar to Uniswap – for xDAI, another derivative that can be freely converted for the widely traded and highly liquid dai (DAI) stablecoin.      Using this route, MOON holders can determine a dollar-denominated value for their tokens. At the time of writing, HoneySwap was offering 10.5 xMOONs for an xDai. Assuming a 1:1 conversion with dai, users can exchange one MOON token for 0.095 DAI.      Data from CoinGecko shows DAI is currently worth $1.01, landing MOON with a price of just under $0.096. And, with Etherscan currently showing a supply of 30 septillion MOON tokens, that has magnified the token's theoretical market cap to the $2.88 septillion figure.      See also: UNI Market Cap Rebounds $120M as Rest of Crypto Market Falters      Of course, this doesn't mean the global economy is now 2,000 times bigger than it was earlier this month. Most of this value remains unrealized. Should more subreddit contributors decide to convert their MOON holdings into Dai, the exchange rate will fall massively, driving the token, and its market cap, down to a far more realistic value.      Further, the massive number seen on Etherscan does conflict with the planned supply indicated on Reddit's page introducing the token. That suggests tokens will be limited to 350 million by 2035.",NEUTRAL,DAI,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | DAI,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/30/is-reddits-moon-token-really-2000x-bigger-than-the-global-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/264439e7631154c573f65f84f1ee23b6b98e13e7-1531x537.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a complaint filed Tuesday in New York's Eastern District Court, the securities watchdog is seeking damages on behalf of ""thousands of retail investors"" from Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, 46.  Karlsson ""enticed and defrauded"" his victims through his purported company Eastern Metal Securities (EMS) by promising ""astronomical returns"" on their investments, the SEC alleges.  It further claims neither Karlsson nor EMS were ever registered with the commission, and neither had qualified for an exemption to registration.  Specifically, from around November 2012 through to June 2019, the SEC alleges Karlsson operated a fraudulent scheme called a ""Pre Funded Reversed Pension Plan.""  During that time Karlsson used multiple fake identities to deceive investors, including some from the deaf community, out of millions of dollars, according to the complaint.  The plan promised a large payout that was tied to the value of gold if victims made an initial investment of $98, but, per the complaint, no such plan existed and no payouts occurred.  In total, Karlsson is alleged to have fleeced 2,200 victims from 49 U.S. states, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico, and 45 other countries, netting himself $3.5 million via payments in bitcoin and other digital assets.  Misappropriated funds of around $1.5 million were used to purchase real estate in Thailand, his country of residence before being extradited to the U.S. to face charges.  The SEC asked the court for Karlsson to be restrained along with other members of the alleged fraud.  The regulator further seeks that Karlsson's ""ill-gotten gains"" should be handed over, along with prejudgment interest and additional penalties.

42384845,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlV0L,1601456400,Bilibili Copycat Tried to Save Itself With a $2M Crypto IEO – It Didn’t Work,"A Chinese video site copycat raised $2.1 million via an initial exchange offering in August 2019 – but it appears this last resort wasn’t enough to save the company from falling apart.      On Sept. 24, the Shanghai Yangpu District Court disclosed an Aug. 31 ruling that video streaming company Dilidili has infringed the trademark of Nasdaq-listed Bilibili and must pay a fine of nearly $500,000.      The ruling followed a separate notice by the Shanghai Minhang District Prosecutor in July, which ordered the arrest of Dilidili’s founder for copyright infringement.      The years-long case has drawn widespread attention among Chinese mainstream media given Dilidili’s outright copy-and-paste from Bilibili, which is China’s hit video site for streaming licensed Japanese anime content.      The episode is also an example of a failed attempt by Chinese companies to use the concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain decentralization to rejuvenize their businesses.      Founded in 2010, Bilibili.com has grown into one of the top video sites in China. It specializes in streaming licensed Japanese animation that targets China’s Generation Z population. Bilibili reportedly has some 170 million monthly active users.      Bilibili went public on Nasdaq in March 2018 with a raise of $483 million. Earlier this year, Sony invested another $400 million in Bilibili and bought over 4% of its shares.      The dispute between Bilibili and Dilidili started in 2015, when Dilidili was created with a name that appeared to be mimicking the incumbent.      Soon after its creation, Dilidili had allegedly downloaded more than 3,000 episodes of Japanese animation from Bilibili and then uploaded it to its own platform for free viewing so that it could monetize the traffic, according to the Shanghai prosecutor’s arrest order.      In January 2019, Bilibili brought a lawsuit against Dilidili and demanded some $4.3 million as damage claims due to Dilidili’s alleged trademark and copyright infringement.      In a notable pivot, Dilidili tapped into the 2019 frenzy of cryptocurrency initial exchange offerings (IEO) in order to build a blockchain-based community governance ecosystem.      Dilidili launched its token, DILI, on the ethereum platform and did the IEO on Chinese exchange Gate.io in August 2019.      Also read: Binance CEO Says He Fully Expects DeFi to Cannibalize His Crypto Exchange      According to Gate.io’s announcement on Aug. 28, Dilidili achieved its goal of raising $2.1 million by selling 1.5 billion DILI, although the total subscription orders it received from Gate.io users were worth over $70 million. The trading started on the same date with a starting price of $0.00143 per DILI.      But soon after trading began, several news reports emerged online with accusations of Dilidili running an illegal fundraise becaause China had banned token-based fundraising activities.      The price of DILI on Gate.io has since plunged by over 90% to just $0.000253.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/30/bilibili-copycat-tried-to-save-itself-with-a-2m-crypto-ieo-it-didnt-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1ea2797cd7a368506623cdaa6e849e14f01a455-1292x781.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384847,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlV5N,1601452800,BitcoinACKs Lets You Track Bitcoin Development and Pay Coders for Their Work,"“If Bitcoin is decentralized, who funds its development?” This longstanding question, historically answered by the quiet work of volunteer Bitcoin developers, now has a new response: a website that allows Bitcoin users to pledge payment for protocol upgrades.      The brainchild of Pierre Rochard, BitcoinACKs aggregates pull requests for protocol improvements from the Bitcoin Core GitHub (in coder vernacular, “ACK” means that a proposal or change passes muster).      The website has been around for a couple of years, but Rochard just rolled out a new feature: a pledge option that allows users to commit funding to a specific protocol improvement and pay developers once that improvement is merged into Bitcoin Core.    BitcoinACKs: a product of the scaling wars    BitcoinACKs was born from the 2017 scaling wars, Rochard told CoinDesk. The bedlam of online debates over block size increases and Segwit made Rochard realize that a well-organized, transparent repository of Bitcoin’s development was necessary, for both Bitcoin’s builders and its consumers.      “After the 2017 scaling drama I decided to get more informed about the Bitcoin open-source development process and see if I could find ways to be helpful. One challenge I had was finding pull requests with specific criteria I was interested in taking a look at: pull requests that were old but had good reviews, pull requests that had been rejected by reviewers, etcetera,” he told CoinDesk.      Read more: SegWit Goes Live: Why Bitcoin's Big Upgrade Is a Blockchain Game-Changer      “There are 13,600 closed pull requests and 388 open ones. For most contributors this is an intractable amount of data to digest! A second challenge was that all of the data related to pull request discussions is siloed on GitHub, and I wanted a local copy to query quickly and with SQL. That's when I decided to build BitcoinACKs.”    A way to track pull requests, pay for Bitcoin developments    The website aggregates pull request comments from developers on GitHub to help developers stay on top of a pull request’s status. On the site, each request is accompanied by its code added and deleted count, the pull request’s author, the date the request was created, who has reviewed it, when the last commit was made in the repository, and whether or not the request has been merged into a Bitcoin Core library for deployment in a protocol update.      With this latest update, Rochard has included a “pledge” feature whereby anyone can pledge to pay contributors for their work on specific pull requests. These pledges can be paid out via Lightning or on-chain payments processed through BTCPay Server.      Those funding development will be able to choose which developer they want to pay for a given pull request, and Rochard told CoinDesk that there are no penalties or enforcements for holding a user to their pledge; it’s up to the user to decide when/if they want to pay out a pledge based on whether or not they are satisfied with the work.      If too many users flake on payments, though, Rochard said he’ll take actions to mitigate such bad behavior. This could involve using discrete log contracts to create smart-contract ensured settlement. In this case, if a user pledges funds to a developer for a pull request, when the request is merged successfully, this result is revealed to the smart contract to release payment.    Skin in the game    BitcoinACKs’ crowdfunding mechanism is a first in Bitcoin’s open-source landscape. Before, you could sponsor individual developers, but you couldn’t directly fund individual upgrades.      Rochard’s tool makes this possible with its bid to drive Bitcoin’s development with free-market principles by aligning user desires with developer incentives.      “To me, BitcoinACKs is how all work should be done: limit orders (pledges) are put in by capital owners, workers create value, and the capital owners send cash directly to the workers. If a capital owner starts spoofing (unfairly reneging on pledges), they get kicked off the platform. If workers don't create value, then they don't get paid.”      Read more: Summer 2020 Is Funding Season for Open-Source Bitcoin Development      This quid pro quo gives its users an avenue to express their desires for the Bitcoin protocol’s development while giving developers another source of revenue.      BitcoinACKs, then, opens a new, developing frontier for both average users and developers. Usually, open-source funding has been the realm of cryptocurrency exchanges or other Bitcoin-related companies. These actors will often offer six-figure lump-sum grants to independent developers to fund their work, as we’ve seen from Kraken, Square Crypto and others.      Now, these high-rolling sums can be matched – if not in kind, then at least in spirit – by the smaller-sum contributions of the Bitcoin community. Rochard emphasized that this model could even help fledgling devs get eyes on their work by sponsoring a bounty for their own pull requests.    User pledges vs. corporate grants    Ultimately, Rochard sees BitcoinACKs as another building block for bankrolling Bitcoin development. It’s the complementary hand shovel to the corporate grant’s bulldozer, facilitating focused, feature-specific work where the grants allow for more general, developer-specific labor.      “I think corporate grants work great for funding a specific subset of open source work: independent, self-directed work. It's funding a public good that has positive externalities on the ecosystem, and I think every profitable business should be doing it.      “BitcoinACKs is for funding targeted, specific outcomes. For example, perhaps your business needs a specific API feature, rather than asking for favors or hiring full-time contributors, it's more convenient to put a bounty on it.”      At press time, 11 pull requests have received pledges ranging from 10,000 satoshis to over 2 million satoshis (or “sats” – a micro measurement of bitcoin wherein 100,000,000 sats equals 1 BTC). The two most popular projects, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal for taproot and another for encrypting messages between Bitcoin nodes, have received pledges of 2,010,116 sats (~$214 or 0.02010116 BTC) and 1,241,210 sats (~$132 or 0.0124121 BTC) respectively.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FORKS,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/30/bitcoinacks-lets-you-track-bitcoin-development-and-pay-coders-for-their-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c21be6e0be48cbfe15c3dcffc87b7403a1720e1-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Armstrong sent the letter, which CoinDesk obtained, to Coinbase employees on Wednesday, stating the time has come to have a ""difficult conversation"" over his recent clarification of Coinbase's mission.  A person close to the situation and speaking under condition of anonymity confirmed the letter was real and said Coinbase recognized certain employees weren't comfortable with the new direction.  Armstrong wrote that Coinbase had ""an apolitical culture"" in an open letter published Sunday that said the exchange would not engage in ""broader societal issues"" or entertain employee discussions about these issues.  Those employees unhappy with the new direction have been informed they can take up a separation package because ""life is too short to work at a company that you are not excited about.""  The packages includes four months' severance for employees who have been at the exchange less than three years or six months for longer-term employees.  Coinbase will also offer six months of health insurance through the U.S. government's COBRA program.  Armstrong said he acknowledged ""many"" were still processing the ""cultural shift"" and offered to answer questions in an ask-me-anything forum slated for Thursday.  Coinbase's CEO also said employees have until Oct. 7 to submit a form to begin the process of severance should they chose to do so.  Beyond that date, it will be assumed that everyone at the company agrees with the new company direction, the letter reads.  ""It doesn't mean you have to agree with every aspect,"" Armstrong said, ""but you should be at least able to disagree and commit to making this new direction a success.""
