Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other major cryptos dipped early over the weekend but regained ground and were up late Sunday.  Insights: DBS Bank's decision to abandon its retail crypto plans did not affect affect the stock price of OSL parent BC Technology Group, and is unlikely to have a big impact on Singapore's crypto industry.  Technician's take: BTC's upside momentum signals remain intact.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,702 +1.2%  Ether (ETH): $3,544 +2.1%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Dogecoin DOGE +5.6% Currency Internet Computer ICP +5.4% Computing Filecoin FIL +4.9% Computing  Top Losers  ""There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,545 -0.3%  DJIA: 34,818 +0.4%  Nasdaq: 14,261 -0.2%  Gold: $1,925 +0.2  Bitcoin, ether rise late  Bitcoin started the weekend quietly, but by late Sunday, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had soared past $47,300 at one point, a 2.6% gain from 24 hours earlier. BTC, which had dropped below $46,000 early Saturday, was more recently trading at about $46,700.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, followed a similar pattern dipping and then regaining ground to jump past the $3,550 level, up about 3% over the same time period.  Major altcoins were mixed, some rising and others falling slightly. Meme coin DOGE rose about 5% on at least one occasion from 24 hours earlier. DOGE alternative SHIB rose more modestly. SOL and ADA recently rose 3% and 2%, respectively. Terra's LUNA token was off about 2%.  Trading was off from higher levels earlier in the week as is often the case on weekends.  Crypto's late weekend surge veered slightly from major equity markets' performance on Friday, which did little more than hold ground from the previous day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell slightly as investors seemed to be girding for the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks worldwide to continue more hawkish monetary policies.  Low interest rates and central bank stimulus that may jar an economy from a slumber lead to rising asset prices. But when inflation increases and the economy overheats, central banks reverse these accommodative policies, typically spurring higher market volatility.  Meanwhile, the macroeconomic environment remained as unsettled as it has been since Russia invaded Ukraine five weeks ago. After pictures emerged of horrific civilian casualties in Bucha, a town near the Ukraine capital Kyiv, Germany's defense minister, Christine Lambrecht, said in a television interview that the European Union should consider halting Russian gas imports.  EU bloc countries have resisted this action, fearful that it would send their economies into recession. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy prices was trading at $102 per barrel, a massive increase from where it started the year.  Still, the crypto rally late last month may not be over, said Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital.  ""Bitcon's consolidation above $46,000 will be key for bullish continuation toward the $50,000 milestone,"" DiPasquale said, striking a cautiously optimistic note. ""While we did see rejection around $48,000, as long as BTC remains above $46,000, bulls can be hopeful of another move. If we lose these levels in the new week, another test of the low $40,000s is the probably scenario.""  Insights  DBS crypto reversal hurts OSL, but only a little  DBS’s about-face decision on a retail crypto exchange – canceling its plans to open one by the end of 2022 – leaves us with two questions: Is this another chapter in Singapore’s continued tightening of crypto regulations? And will this stymie OSL, the Hong Kong-based institutional exchange that provides DBS with exchange software?  The answer to both is, not really.  It’s not a secret that authorities in Singapore aren’t fans of retail crypto trading. Earlier this year, regulators banned direct-to-consumer marketing for exchanges and told crypto ATM operators to turn off their machines. It also put DeFiance Capital, one of the larger crypto funds in the city-state, on an investor alert list because it was “wrongly perceived as being licensed or regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.”  But Singapore hasn’t changed its tone on institutional investment in crypto. That has always been what the country has been interested in developing as a hub, not retail, which requires nanny-like regulations to ensure amateur traders leveraging their retirement savings don’t get rekt when their crypto position is liquidated. Needing to regulate with a heavy hand isn’t what Singapore wants.  If DBS were to actually launch a retail crypto exchange it wouldn’t look like what many retail traders are used to seeing. There would be a limited selection of tokens, and decentralized finance (DeFi) would definitely be out of the question. While there would undoubtedly be an element of convenience because of the integration with the bank, it would be challenged to attract significant volume because it wouldn’t be competitive with leading exchanges in terms of features.  In its recent earnings, OSL’s parent, BC Technology Group, highlighted its Software-as-a-Service (licensing its exchange software to other entities) as a growth point.  The company cites “service fees from SaaS of HK$10.1 million (US$1.2 million), an increase of 104.2% year over year,” as a driver of this quarter’s growth, specifically naming its partnership with DBS as a way to expand the business past institutional only and on to retail.  But against group revenue of HK$352 million (US$45 million), this amount is insignificant.  “OSL’s institutional exposure and licensed status far eclipse that slight negative,” Esme Pau, an analyst with Tonghai Securities, told CoinDesk. “With [its] core business in serving professional investors. OSL is a proxy to digital assets institutionalization. In the broader scheme of things, increasing regulatory clarity is the definite future direction of travel for digital assets.”  Investors didn’t seem to care either. Even after the news broke, the stock continued its week-long winning streak on the Hong Kong markets up 5%.  Tonghai predicts the company will turn a profit in the medium term given the competitive moat it has of being the only licensed exchange in Hong Kong – a much larger, and less competitive, market than DBS’s retail crypto play.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holds Support Above $44K; Resistance at $48K-$51K  Bitcoin (BTC) bounced off short-term support at $44,000 as momentum improved.  The cryptocurrency is up 5% over the past week, although resistance at $48,000 and $50,996 could stall the rally, similar to what occurred in September of last year.  This time, however, pullbacks could be brief, so long as buyers defend support above $43,000-$45,000. Further, the significant loss of downside momentum, per the MACD indicator, over the past few weeks could encourage additional buying on price dips.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is approaching neutral territory after an overbought reading appeared on March 28. That suggests a pause in the current price rally, which typically occurs during the beginning of the month.  For now, BTC is testing support around its previous breakout point at $45,000. Upside exhaustion signals, per the DeMARK indicators provided a timely countertrend reversal set-up earlier this week, although a continuation of that sell signal has not been confirmed. That means price action is currently neutral, pending a decisive break above or below the five-day price range.

42394256,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvahIR,1648997400,"Now That Q1 Is Over, Is the Bull Market Back?","Calendar year quarters provide an artificial breakpoint to reflect on what happened. The first quarter of 2022 didn’t really provide much by way of crypto market movement until it was basically over. Since February until this past weekend the price of bitcoin (BTC) had been range-bound between $37,500 and $42,500. Given the macro landscape, this was surprising. Russia invaded Ukraine, the Federal Reserve announced at least six rate hikes and there were lots of things happening in U.S. and European Union regulation.  It was even more surprising if we compared bitcoin’s price in that period to, well, everything else. Between Feb. 1 and March 14 the S&P 500 shed 8% and long-term (20-year) Treasurys dipped 7%. Meanwhile, bond markets were ravaged and we saw the price of commodities, like oil and nickel, spike aggressively. (Side note: The story about the London Metal Exchange and the nickel short squeeze is a must read.)  Meanwhile, bitcoin didn’t really do anything.  That was true until last week. We rolled into that weekend, March 25, with bitcoin at $44,000 and by that Monday, March 28, it had brushed up against $48,000. This gain was partially catalyzed by the Luna Foundation Guard planning to buy up to $10 billion of BTC to back its terraUSD (UST) stablecoin. The persistent bitcoin purchases by LFG has proved to be a near-term tailwind for bitcoin price. Crypto investors, who are salivating at the prospect of earning up to 19.62% interest on UST holdings using the Anchor protocol, seem to agree as LUNA, the token that powers UST, gained ~15% in the last week of the first quarter.  With the price of bitcoin finally trending up, the bitcoin options market saw open interest (OI), the U.S. dollar amount allocated to bitcoin options contracts, hit a year-high ~$9.8 billion on March 24, a day where more than $3 billion in options expired. Since then, we've seen more than $1.3 billion in options enter the market, marking a relatively quick recovery.  However, bitcoin wasn’t the only asset that the market has liked recently. In fact, the market liked ether (Ethereum’s native asset) more, with ETH gaining 23% since Feb. 1 (compared to BTC’s 18%). ETH’s price catalyst came on March 14 when Ethereum successfully “merged” on the Kiln testnet ahead of the blockchain’s eventual move to proof-of-stake. Ethereum changing its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake has been closely watched by investors, and the successful test signaled to the market that Ethereum might actually make the transition that has been in the works since 2015.  On the topic of ether, its price compared to bitcoin’s (ETHBTC) has started to reverse. ETHBTC was on a steady climb from 0.024 to as high as 0.087 in 2021 (the unit is bitcoin per ether), but ETH’s market cap has mostly lost ground to BTC this year, dropping from 0.083 to 0.065 between Jan. 4 and March 14. Since then, ETHBTC has steadily walked up to 0.073.  From here, it is natural to look at bitcoin dominance, the measure of BTC market capitalization compared to the market capitalization of all crypto assets. In times of uncertainty, bitcoin dominance tends to gain ground, and that has come to bear so far in 2022. It has been a weird, tough year in general for the crypto market, even with the recent run-up (bitcoin lost 2% in the first quarter).  Something off-the-wall as we look toward Q2  As we take a look towards the second quarter, I want to share a detailed (and esoteric) on-chain bitcoin chart Glassnode published in its most recent newsletter. The chart is titled “Bitcoin: Realized Cap HODL Waves (Coins > 1yr).”  HODL Waves are groupings of bitcoins differentiated by the amount of time those bitcoins have been held (e.g., bitcoins held for two years would be in the two- to three-year HODL Wave). If we then weigh those HODL Waves by “Realized Price,” the price at which those bitcoins last moved, we can use the result to analyze the U.S. dollar wealth held in those bitcoins. If we filter out coins less than a year old, we get an interesting visual.  If we consider that bear markets come in two phases, the first where a low proportion of wealth is held by older investors and the second where the wealth disparity recovers strongly as more coins age into the one-year band at a higher cost basis. That cost basis should stand in as a higher floor value than the previous cycle. We might be at a turning point in this bear market.  Lastly, while the past is not indicative of the future, understanding the past can help us anticipate what might happen. Looking back, we know that it sometimes snows in April on the bitcoin market. But usually bitcoin performs well in April, with an average gain of about 17% over the month. So, who knows, maybe we’ll close the book on the bear market in the next 27 days. But maybe not.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | LUNA,BTC | ETH | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/03/now-that-q1-is-over-is-the-bull-market-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a7c311b9f06aa54cdba2cc49ef095d37d1c1560-5333x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13220421,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=487456,1648965894,True Decentralization Can be Achieved With Oracles,"The term &apos;oracle&apos; has become quite commonly used within crypto circles across the globe in recent years, and rightly so. This is because these novel offerings are designed to connect various blockchain projects with a wide array of off-chain data, thus allowing for the advent of many novel use cases. That said, most traditional oracles are faced with two core issues. Firstly, they require a centralized entity/intermediary to facilitate their access to external, real-time data — as a result of which third parties can potentially alter the data being supplied to it. Secondly, centralized oracles often have to forego many of the privacy advantages put forth by smart contracts, thereby posing major risks to the system&apos;s overall security. A smart contract can be thought of as a program/transaction protocol designed to automatically execute, administer and note relevant events and actions as per the terms of a predefined digital agreement. Decentralized oracles explained As highlighted earlier, centralized oracles serve as single, stand-alone entities that provide data from an external source to a smart contract operating within a set governance framework. As a result, they, more often than not, feature a single point of failure that can result in them being corrupted or being attacked.

The experts also urged nearby businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments in regular transactions. While Lugano&apos;s crypto declaration surprised opponents of bitcoiners, the crypto community&apos;s reaction was predictable, as they anticipated that more nations and districts would recognize Bitcoin due to rising expansion, questionable international circumstances, and BTC&apos;s status as a hedge against an unsteady global economy.
