42378595,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inTH,1455569513,French Politicians Predict Blockchain Tech Will Lead to Job Losses,"Two of France's left-leaning political parties are speculating that technologies like the blockchain could lead to substantial job losses in the financial sector.  The comments came part of a document published last week by the Left Front and the French Communist Party entitled ""Digital Revolution,"" which explores the implications of Big Data, connected devices, 3-D printing and the blockchain on the power of state institutions – and how those power centers may be disintermediated by these technologies.  The impact of this technology on jobs, the groups argue in the missive, could be widely felt in the years ahead.  A translation of the document reads:  ""In the context of current social and economic relations, the digital revolution, with automation linked to Big Data, robotics, connected objects, the blockchain in banking and financial...will cause [a] massive destruction of skilled jobs which will not be compensated by the creation of a number [of] restricted [and] highly skilled jobs.""  The French political parties aren’t the first to speculate on potential job losses arising from the use of blockchains in financial services. Last December, CFTC Commissioner J Christopher Giancarlo suggested that some financial sector positions, especially those focused on record-keeping, may be replaced entirely.  ""This transformation will not come without consequences, however, including a greatly disruptive impact on the human capital that supports the record-keeping of contemporary financial markets,” he said at the time.  The comments coincide with the other reports that have found an increasing need for professionals that can bridge the knowledge gap between the existing financial and blockchain startup communities.

42378602,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7inap,1455565520,China's Central Bank Weighing Blockchain Tech for Digital Currency,"The head of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) opened up about its proposed digital currency initiative in a new interview with Caixin Weekly today, suggesting that the Chinese central bank is considering options that do not use blockchain technologies in its development.  Speaking to the news source, governor Zhou Xiaochuan said that the PBOC is considering mobile payments, cloud computation, secure chip and blockchain tech as means to create and operate an electronic cash network.  However, Xiaochuan suggested that there's no indication of what the finished product will look like, going on to say:  ”We will cooperate with the financial industry and science and technology community to continue researches on all kinds of innovative technologies, to improve the technical framework for issuing and circulating digital currency, and to fully predict, timely react to and effectively address risks that may emerge during the application.”  The comments follow speculation about the PBOC’s 20th January announcement of the program, which left it unclear as to what the central bank meant by its use of the phrase “digital currency”, a term long associated with bitcoin and other blockchain-based consensus networks.  Xiaochuan went on to indicate that blockchains today consume “too many resources” in terms of computation and data storage, and that the bank believes the technology would not be able to handle desired transaction volumes.  “We need to wait and see whether this problem can be solved in the future,” Xiaochuan said, noting the bank has invested significant resources in researching the topic.  Privacy  One topic where bitcoin was specifically discussed in relation to the PBOC’s digital currency initiative was its ability to offer privacy, an attribute Xiaochuan said in the interview would need to be a component of the digital currency offering.  Though all bitcoin transactions are recorded and broadcast via the public blockchain, transactions are afforded a degree of privacy through the network’s pseudonymous address system.  Still, Xiaochuan said that the digital currency will use “many information technologies”, including cryptographic algorithms, to guard against counterfeiting.  As framed by Caixin, the question also alluded to the “51% attack” security risk on the bitcoin network, whereby a miner or collection of miners representing more than half of the hashing power would be able to corrupt the veracity of its decentralized ledger.  In this respect, Xiaochuan hinted that a blockchain-based digital currency issued by the bank was likely to run on a permissioned network that would guard against outside tampering.  “For a digital currency controlled by the central bank, a combination of technological measures, institutional design as well as laws and regulations will be applied to ensure the security of its operation system,” he said. “This differs from the bitcoin at the very start.”  Timeline  Also discussed was the projected timeline for the digital currency initiative, with Caixin asking when the project could replace paper money.  Xiaochuan indicated that while there is no timetable yet for the release, it is unlikely that such a system would completely replace the need for a paper currency.  “It will only take several months for a small country to replace an old version of paper money with a new one. But it has taken about 10 years for China to do the same thing,” he said.  Xiaochuan suggested that if its digital currency was phased into the economy, it could become gradually more expensive to transact in paper-based money, thereby motivating users to make the transition.  Still, he acknowledged that the switch was likely to be slow, concluding:  ”With the transaction costs of paper money rising, people will be motivated to opt more for digital money. But digital currency and cash will co-exist for a long time.”  Image via golddc / Shutterstock.com",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/15/chinas-central-bank-weighing-blockchain-tech-for-digital-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c7ffe979115d4edd0cf14957958b48e3dc6817e-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378606,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ineb,1455560009,UK Parliament Considers Effects of Blockchain on Bank Solvency,"A UK Parliament discussion of a bill relating to financial services regulation has raised questions about how bank liquidity and solvency should be monitored in the face of new technologies such as blockchain.  Introduced in 2015, the ""Bank of England and Financial Services Bill"" aims to reassess how the central bank should be organized to exercise its mandate on the issue. Of interest during an 11th February meeting was a clause relating to the handling of prudential regulation, or laws that attempt to ensure that domestic financial institutions are financially healthy and able to withstand operational shocks.  One issue discussed during the meeting was how the bill proposes that the role of the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), a financial services regulatory body created in response to the financial crisis, should be altered so that it would function as a committee.  The Bank of England is already the parent organization of the PRA, though some members of Parliament worry that any increased oversight would perhaps lead to the same issues the agency was created to solve.  Writing on the issue was Richard Burgon, a legislator with the British Labour Party who argued that the clause would undermine the authority of the PRA at a time when smaller financial services companies, such as blockchain companies, are becoming more integral to the health of the overall British economy.  Burgon wrote:  ""With the creation of new starter banks, there is a greater need than ever for microprudential regulation as those institutions start up in business. If we continue to start new credit unions and new blockchain banks and so on, microprudential regulations remain fundamentally important.""  Burgon’s comments were echoed by other members of Parliament including George Kerevan, who along with Burgon, was one of seven MPs that voted against allowing the clause to stand. In total, the clause received 10 votes that it should stand as part of the bill.  With the approval, the bill will head to the committee stage in the House of Commons, with the next meeting scheduled for 23rd February.  New uncertainties  The comments come amid a growing focus on how prudential regulators may or may not be taking steps to ensure markets aren’t destabilized by blockchain-based technologies.  For example, the topic was discussed at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) in Miami by industry legal authorities, who suggested that similar conversations may be ongoing between major banks and other prudential regulatory authorities, such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the US.  The process, they suggested, could lead to the creation of frameworks such as Basel III, voluntary regulation that oversees bank capital requirements and liquidity, though they said much of this debate was unlikely to be made public.

42398884,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8eN,1455549022,Australian Regulator: Banks Didn't Collude Over Bitcoin Account Closures,"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has concluded that Australian banks did not collude in blocking services for bitcoin firms and that a full investigation into the affair is not necessary.  According to the Australian Financial Review, ACCC chairman Rod Sims wrote to Senator Matthew Canavan of The National Party of Australia – the Queensland representative who had originally requested an investigation into the matter – saying there was no evidence that banks had colluded before closing bank accounts held by bitcoin companies.  Sims further wrote that the commission's inquiry had found that the banks had acted on an individual basis ""in order to ensure their ability to meet their regulatory obligations and manage their risk"".  Colluding over the account closures would have seen the banks acting in contravention of the 2010 Competition and Consumer Act and its provisions against cartels.  The AFR reports Sims as writing:  ""The available material also suggests that banks have made their decisions at different times, and with different outcomes.""  He cited examples of one bank deciding to not deal with digital currency businesses in 2011, while a different bank came to the same decision in June 2015.  Further, some banks are still providing services to digital currency companies on a case-by-case basis, Sims said.  Inquiry criticised  However, the AFR reports that both bitcoin companies and Labor Senator Sam Dastyari have criticised the ACCC's findings, saying it had not properly investigated the issue since it had failed to reach out to the companies whose accounts were closed.  Sims rejected that suggestion, however, telling the news source that the commission had communicated with some of the affected companies.  Further, he said the banks had given investigators access to documents and had provided credible explanations about the account closures.  The ACCC had therefore come to the decision that there was no need to launch a full investigation.  An inquiry was originally called for by Senator Canavan in October 2015, when he urged the ACCC to investigate whether the banks had acted in an anti-competitive manner after abruptly closing the accounts of some 17 bitcoin businesses, including Bit Trade and Buyabitcoin.
