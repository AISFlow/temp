42398669,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgGxw,1441925878,"Trust, Law Enforcement and Killer Apps: Consensus 2015 Morning Sessions","CoinDesk's inaugural conference took place at the TimesCenter in the heart of New York today, with over 500 guests in attendance.  Garrick Hileman, a CoinDesk analyst and economic historian at London School of Economics, kicked off the day's sessions with an overview of the current state of bitcoin and blockchain technology.  Next was the day's first panel, Trust, Permissions, Openness: The Future of Innovation on the Blockchain, moderated by Emin Gun Sirer of Cornell University and featuring Adam Ludwin, of Chain.com; Greg Maxwell of Blockstream; Bitcoin XT developer Mike Hearn, joining via video link; researcher Tim Swanson and Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum.  The panellists explored the obstacles facing greater adoption and possible applications of blockchain technologies.  Buterin said he thought the blockchain space had diverged in the last couple of years and commented he had been ""generally impressed"" by institutional adoption in the last year.  Maxwell agreed, commenting:  ""The amount of interest and excitement around cryptocurrencies and blockchain is tremendous but we are still using our training wheels, we are still learning.""  With regards to the possibility of being able to use one single multi-purpose blockchain, Hearn explained that the question being posed was based on a somewhat incorrect premise.  ""You don't need blockchains to do smart contracts, banks could provide them too if they wanted to with an API,"" he added.  Ludwin, on the other hand, spoke about a future similar to that of a financial cloud with many interoperable blockchains.  Unprecedented Transparency? Law Enforcement on the Blockchain  The next session, titled Unprecedented Transparency? Law Enforcement on the Blockchain, featured Kathryn Haun, of the US Dept. of Justice; Tigran Gambaryan of IRS Criminal Investigations; Catherine Pelker of the FBI; and Jason Weinstein, of Steptoe and Johnson and was led by Jerry Brito of CoinCenter.  Haun said the US Dept. of Justice had used blockchain analysis in its Ripple investigation and during the investigation of Silk Road's Baltimore Task Force, which led to the identification of illicit activity carried out by former agents Carl Mark Force and Sean Bridges.  Despite not divulging specifics about the investigation, Haun was able to determine that this had been the first time blockchain analysis had been used in a public charging document.  Speaking from her experience at the FBI, Pelker pointed out ""blockchain analysis is a powerful tool, but it is not a magic solution to any of our issues"", and highlighted her need for bitcoin exchanges to both collect data from customers and subsequently analyse the blockchain.  However, Weinstein highlighted the need for law enforcement and regulators to be able to police both the on and off ramps.  ""The policing of the on-ramps is important because when you do blockchain analysis you reach the point where you need to connect that to a person,"" he said.  For Haun, the emergence of technologies has two-fold implications. On the one hand, she said, new technological developments may enable crimes. Alternatively, these technologies also provide another avenue for law enforcement to explore and use in their investigations.  She added:  ""It gives law enforcement another area to mine for information about those committing criminal activity.""  In terms of what's currently missing, Haun highlighted the need to train more agents and people in the government about bitcoin's distributed ledger and how to analyse it.  According to Weinstein, the benefits of being able to use the blockchain in law enforcement investigations lie in the fact the distributed ledger eliminates issues around data retention and the barriers imposed by geographical borders.  Pelker, however, noted the blockchain's borderless nature ""cuts both ways"", explaining it can be very difficult to actually progress with an investigation if the agency does not know the country it needs to issue the appropriate request to.  Further challenges, Gambaryan said, revolve around the issue of presenting blockchain analysis as evidence in court, noting:  ""The information available is very limited and, in more complex cases, following the money is still a challenge.""  The critical path to bitcoin mass adoption  Up next, Michael J Casey from MIT Media Lab moderated a discussion about bitcoin mass adoption, featuring panelists Connie Chung of Expedia; Jon Downing of Visa Europe Collab; and Vinny Lingham of Gyft.  Casey, who recently closed the door on an 18-year journalism career, opened by noting how the perception around bitcoin had changed in the last couple of years.  ""At the end of 2013, we all thought of it as a currency, as means of exchange that would challenge the dollar ... we used to get very excited about merchant adoption announcements"".  Nowadays, the consumer story is still very much alive, he said, but it looks very different.  Chung noted that bitcoin payments at the online travel giant typically decreased in line with the digital currency's drop in price. Despite this, she said Expedia – which integrated bitcoin payments in June last year – had seen ""steady usage"".  For Lingham, offering bitcoin paying customers a discount is important and worked very well for Gyft, he said:  ""If you don't simplify the use [of bitcoin], why would people want to use it as a currency? Realistically, as a merchant, we are saving interchange fees, so, why not give it back to the customer?""  With regards to potential use cases, Lingham also explained how the digital currency may help people living in emerging countries, such as Africa, who want to purchase items online from US retailers:  ""Most US retailers will not ship anything [to countries in Africa such Nigeria] because of credit card fraud. There are a million people living in Africa, this is a very strong use case for bitcoin.""  Speaking on behalf of Visa Europe Collab, Downing – who noted bitcoin volatility was currently a key issue – said the organisation sought collaboration with all the key players in the ecosystem and it is exploring several opportunities, including micropayments, international payments and smart contracts.  Moving on to the notorious chicken-and-egg debate, which seeks to determine whether mainstream adoption is down to consumers or merchants, Downing drew on the comparison with contactless debit cards and how these first needed to be issued by banks for consumers to subsequently use them.  ""It's finding those cases where people feel like using that technology on a day-to-day basis, that it is going to be used reliably and that it is beneficial to both parties.""  A $1.6 Quadrillion Opportunity  The morning's sessions were rounded off by Hans Morris of Nyca Partners, who spoke to Blythe Masters of Digital Asset Holdings; Houman Shadab of New York Law School; and Brad Peterson of Nasdaq.  Morris began by addressing the need to eliminate opacity in reconciliation. The decision to replace a working system is not one to be taken lightly, he said, as it could take a major firm approximately three-to-five years to do so and there's a high failure rate.  Shadab said blockchain technology was being discussed as a direct result of the financial crisis. What blockchains are trying to do, Shadab said, is to ""take away back offices"".  Peterson joined the conversation by giving an overview of Nasdaq and its involvement with the sector:  ""We really have to master this [blockchain] technology ... we looked at where we could find alignment with this technology and fit it into something that we are already doing as part of our business.""  Masters, who spent 20 years working at financial services in JP Morgan, touched upon her first impressions of blockchain technology:  ""When I first came across blockchain technology I was frankly quite surprised and taken by the potential for a technology to check a lot of boxes that represent very real and very current points of pain the existing financial and market infrastructure and ecosystems.""  For her, these points of pain include a generally depressed revenue environment, rising costs associated with compliance and regulation, inefficient infrastructure. ""Firms are being asked to capitalise for more risk,"" she added.  Some regulators whose focus lies on systemic risk, Masters added, also see the benefits of this type of technology and the potential it has both to eliminate friction and reduce risk.  ""The journey has commenced and is well under way, it will succeed and the upside is enormous. It's in the interest of everyone that we make progress here.""

42398665,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgGu0,1441890308,Coinalytics Raises $1.1 Million for Blockchain Data Platform,"Coinalytics has raised $1.1m as part of a seed round led by Palo Alto-based incubator The Hive.  Founded in April 2014, Coinalytics describes itself as a ""real-time intelligence service"" for blockchain platforms. Today, the startup enables clients in the bitcoin industry, including undisclosed payment processors, wallet providers and exchanges, to conduct risk assessment through blockchain analysis.  Coinalytics CEO Fabio Federici told CoinDesk:  ""We're not building the infrastructure. But, if someone is accepting bitcoin, we can provide them ways to understand their users better.""  Federici explained that by using the blockchain and its in-house tools for pattern recognition and real-time online learning, clients are able to accept bitcoin transactions before they are confirmed by the payment system's mining network.  ""We analyze the inputs of the transaction, the structure of previous transactions and pull in metadata around those inputs to get a feel for whether the customer is reliable,"" Federici said.  A graduate of 500 Startups, the company had originally sought to apply its data analysis for bitcoin traders. However, Federici suggested that as the industry shifted toward an interested in blockchains more broadly, his startup moved with the direction of the market.  ""Most of the demand was more about the blockchain and trying to get insights from the blockchain, so we decided to focus on blockchain only,"" Federici told CoinDesk.  Today, the three-person company offers APIs and front-end interfaces for clients. Coinalytics indicated it is seeking to use its funding to expand its platform for use in financial services, supply chain management and the Internet of Things.

42398659,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgGp5,1441890029,Bitcoin-to-Cash App Abra Raises $12 Million Series A,"Abra, the startup developing a bitcoin powered remittance app, has raised just over $12 million in new funding.  The Series A round drew support from a large number of investors including Arbor Ventures, RRE Ventures and First Round Capital.  Combined with previous capital raised during a seed round, the startup has netted more than $14m in investment to date.  The company plans to use the new funding to further develop the functionality of its remittance app as well as support efforts to expand the reach of its service.  In a statement, Jim Robinson, general partner at RRE Ventures and a co-founder of Abra, said the company is ""fully leveraging the potential of the technology by reducing friction in financial services"".  He added:  ""It's not about bitcoin for the sake of bitcoin – it's about how the technology can solve problems for consumers worldwide, even if they don't know what the blockchain is.""  The startup came out of stealth mode earlier this year at the end of Launch Festival 2015. Abra uses bitcoin as backend infrastructure but denominates funds that pass through its system in US dollars.

42398655,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgGm8,1441886715,Funding Raised by Bitcoin Hardware Wallet 'Case' Reaches $2.25 Million,"Case has raised $1m in additional seed funding.  The figure adds to the $1.25m in capital the New York-based startup secured in June and brings its total amount raised to $2.25m. The seed round, now closed, was led by Future\Perfect Ventures, a New York venture firm whose portfolio includes industry startups such as Abra, Blockchain and Blockstream.  One of a growing number of bitcoin hardware wallet providers, including companies like KeepKey, Ledger and Trezor, Case is distinguished by a product designed with advanced security features such as biometrics and veteran entrepreneur and CEO Melanie Shapiro, who previously founded and sold social client startup Digsby.  In statements, Shapiro suggested that the funding seeks to move the startup past its competitors by catering to both consumers and enterprise bitcoin and blockchain firms.  For example, the company announced yesterday it had participated in the issuance of shares in Pivit, a newly launched public opinion marketplace. Pivit had its private investor shares recording on distributed ledger technology developed by Digital Asset Holdings (DAH).  Shapiro said:  ""Bitcoin and other distributed ledger technologies facilitate the transfer of digital financial assets within cryptographically secured, immutable environments. Case acts as a secure signing device that streamlines this process without increasing the risk of compromising sensitive data.”  The share issuance comes as capital markets-focused blockchain startups continue to explore the viability of issuing private shares on distributed ledgers. Similar projects have so far been announced by Overstock's tØ and Symbiont.

42398658,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgGq4,1441879242,Digital Currency Crimes Chief: DOJ Has No Bitcoin Agenda,"Few groups have been as early and as active in attempting to understand the implications of digital currency and blockchain technology as US law enforcement.  Despite expanded use and investment, cryptographic currencies such as bitcoin continue to be widely used for illicit activities. Dark market operators and extortionists were early and aggressive in their attempts to capitalize on the digital payment network and its cash-like approach to transactions, a trend that continues.  As evidence, the Department of Justice, US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (DOJ), appointed Kathryn Haun as its first Digital Currency Crimes Coordinator this June. The position finds Haun heading up a multi-agency task force in San Francisco and comprised of representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Secret Service (USSS), among several other federal and state organizations.  In an interview, Haun countered some of the misconceptions that have sometimes proliferated among the technology's enthusiasts, many of whom seek to portray the interests of her agency and the US government as at odds with a currency that operates without government backing.  Haun stressed that the DOJ and others tasked with policing financial crimes have finite resources, and are not engaged in pursuing a broad agenda against bitcoin. Rather, she suggested that the agency she works for and the wider digital currency and blockchain community share a common ground, arguing that a safer environment for consumers, with clear regulations to separate bad actors, is in the best interest of all.  Haun told CoinDesk:  ""Everyone benefits from clarity. The players in the ecosystem, the businesses, the government – everyone benefits from knowing which laws and regulations apply for digital currency and how those laws apply.""  Haun portrayed efforts by agencies such as the DOJ as supportive of the goal of clarifying the application of existing US laws and regulations on the matter. Further, she emphasized that while the DOJ does not write the law, it does play an active role in presenting US judges with cases that will inform future rulemaking.  Startup compliance  According to Haun, an example of the balance federal agencies are attempting to strike is the DOJ's joint effort with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that ended in Ripple Labs and a subsidiary being fined $700,000 for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.  Haun suggested that, while Ripple Labs may have been investigated for conduct that occurred early in its days as a digital currency-focused startup, it was not part of any ""particular special initiative or drive"" to examine the entire industry.  ""Due to Ripple’s extensive remedial efforts, including its commitment to enhancing its existing anti-money laundering and know your customer procedures, among other factors, we decided not to prosecute Ripple criminally but instead reached a settlement agreement,"" Haun explained.  Haun pointed out that there were no indictments or criminal charges brought against Ripple Labs or its executives, framing the resolution as a compromise between a US agency with a responsibility to ensure financial firms are compliant with the law and a startup that was operating in a fast-moving environment.  She said this reflects the understanding among financial agencies that smaller or early-stage companies may not necessarily have one employee whose only job is to serve as an AML or compliance officer.  “Perhaps that individual has a number of different roles in the company. But the fact that a company is small or just starting out doesn’t mean it doesn’t need to have a compliance program in place, because these are important issues for a company of any size or stage to have addressed in the beginning,” she continued, adding:  “As is often said there is no one-size-fits-all compliance program, and at the end of the day it depends on any given entity’s customer base, risk level and other factors unique to that entity.""  Investigation pipeline  Haun further expanded on how cases are brought to her attention as Digital Currency Crimes Coordinator, suggesting that they are sourced through a variety of means.  Agents may receive leads directly from financial institutions, or develop them through other sources. Alleged victims, she said, may sometimes report crimes directly to the department through federal and local law enforcement.  Ultimately, she stressed there was no one answer to how leads for cases were developed and no one particular investigative agency with sole responsibility for bringing the investigations.  ""It’s like asking ‘which agency handles crimes committed with cash?’"" she said. ""The answer is that no one single agency or unit alone does – as with other forms of payment, crimes committed with digital currency or using new financial technology span many areas, and accordingly, numerous different agencies and units within those agencies are involved in these investigations.""  As evidence of this, she pointed out that some of the digital currency cases publicly prosecuted so far have been markedly different in subject matter, categorizing the case against former DEA Special Agent Carl Force and former Secret Service Agent Shaun Bridges as fundamentally a public corruption case, while Ripple Labs was more a white collar matter and Silk Road more a global narcotics conspiracy.  Although the department has seen an influx of extortion scams involving bitcoin, she said the nature of illegal activities committed with the technology is capable of expanding across ""almost all varieties"" of crime.  As for companies that have relocated outside the US in a protest of increased laws and regulation, she suggested that this doesn't necessarily play into the agency's considerations about enforcing existing laws.  However, she did stress the wide mandate the DOJ has to prosecute criminal activities does not depend solely on physical location of an individual or entity, adding:  ""Let's say an exchange is engaged in laundering illegal proceeds, and the underlying criminal activity is here, that under the law is sufficient to affect the jurisdiction of this district. Likewise if the exchange is doing business in the district or purposefully directing their business activities here, that may also be sufficient. The law is not such that a company has to be physically headquartered here in order to fall within the jurisdiction here.""  Role and responsibilities  The new role is an outgrowth of Haun's experience with transnational and organized criminal syndicates, identity theft, money laundering, and cybercrime; all specialties that led her to an early awareness of the technology.  ""About three years ago, I started focusing on the area of digital currency and mobile payments. We saw more organized criminal enterprises were turning to the deep web to buy and sell their goods and services, and also we started to see a lot of overlap with marketplaces where you could buy illegal items with bitcoin or other digital currencies,"" she recalled. ""So, I started asking ‘What is bitcoin?’""  Today, Haun's role, while constantly evolving, has her coordinating the district's cases involving digital currencies and new financial technologies; keeping abreast of new developments in the industry and conducting training with other agencies on the technology.  ""The office was very supportive of the efforts to focus on these new technologies. That makes a lot of sense since our district covers the entire bay area and in many ways Silicon Valley is ground zero, where a lot of the action and investment in this sphere is happening in the US,"" she explained.  Her personal education process, Haun said, continues to this day. She attends conferences as her casework allows, and presides over regular meetings (she did not comment as to how regular) of a task force where government agencies share information on cases involving digital currencies.  According to Haun, the task force started as an informal group of government agents who needed to better understand how to navigate the complexities of investigating and prosecuting crimes in this environment. Early questions, she said, focused on subjects ranging from how Tor mail accounts worked to best practices for seizure warrants for cases involving bitcoin.  Haun is also involved in attempts to bring together law enforcement officials with members of the bitcoin and blockchain industry. However, she emphasized that such professional outreach is focused on uniting participants in both fields toward common goals for the public good.  Haun concluded:  ""We have to be able to do our job irrespective of whether we face criticism. We can't shy away from prosecutions that might be unpopular. Our job is to pursue justice and enforce the law.""  Kathryn Haun is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York. Join her at the TimesCenter on 10th September.
