42402752,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdco2M,1554498913,Google Searches for 'Bitcoin' Hit Highest Total Since November,"Trading back above $5,000, more eyes are on the world’s largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, than have been in nearly 19 weeks, a fact affirmed as worldwide Google searches for “bitcoin” currently hover at levels not seen since Nov. 20.  Google Trend data reveals the spike in searches was single-handedly achieved on April 2 when the price of the cryptocurrency surged nearly 20 percent in a single hour to clock $4,961, its highest price since Nov. 19, according to CoinDesk’s price data.  While Google Trends does not provide the exact number of searches, it is apparent the amount of worldwide “bitcoin” searches reached 90 percent of what it was on Nov. 20, as is shown below.  Indeed, ""bitcoin"" searches sky-rocketed on Tuesday as investors, traders and the media alike were searching for reasons as to why bitcoin's price surged.  Interestingly, most searches came from countries that may not seem to be the most likely of origins.  Google's data further reveals the largest amount of searches on April 2-3 were from St. Helena, Netherlands, South Africa, Nigeria and Austria in that order. The U.S., Canada, and the U.K. did not crack the top 10 of most ""bitcoin"" searchers, ranking in at 11, 12 and 17 respectively.  The significance of a spike in bitcoin searches may seem trivial at face value, but studies have shown there is a connection between the price of the cryptocurrency and its search interest. The core findings suggest periods of low search volume tend to precede large markups in price that coincide with bitcoin's famous, or perhaps infamously wild market cycles.

To be released at the Boltathon hackathon, the developer tools include a configuration helper for setting up a lightning node and an invoice “playground,"" where users can test if their lightning node can connect to other nodes. Then, there's a liquidity tool for making sure users can send and receive payments, a feature that's not as easy as it might sound as the technology is still under development.  The tools are a part of Radar ION, Radar's site for onboarding lightning users. Participants in this weekend's virtual Boltathon conference, featuring a hackathon dedicated solely to lightning, are invited to use these tools.  While Radar is best-known for creating Radar Relay, a decentralized exchange for trading tokens without a middleman over ethereum, this is the team's public debut branching out into the bitcoin realm by focusing on lightning technology.  Radar product lead Brandon Curtis told CoinDesk:  ""We're constantly scanning the horizon for groundbreaking technologies, last year our R&D team identified lightning as promising technology, with the potential for more than just payments. While an ethereum [decentralized application (dapp)] was our first product, our parent brand Radar is focused on building products for our next financial system.""  They have plans to keep building out this functionality. Developers have made all sorts of apps on top of the lightning network, such as Y'alls for paying for articles using lightning and a game of monetized chess. Radar's next goal is to make it even easier for developers to create these types of apps.  ""Next we're focused on building tools to support developers creating apps on the network,"" Curtis added.

The device demonstrates how households will in the near future be able to control their power usage in a ""safe and transparent manner,"" Wien Energie said in a press release. The device is currently on show at the ANON Blockchain Summit in Vienna.  The fridge can be controlled via a smart device app that enables the user to set the temperature of the fridge and freezer compartment, thereby directly controlling power consumption. The app also provides feedback on the device, such as sending an alert if the door is left open, as well as giving a view into power consumption over time and carbon dioxide footprint.  More interestingly, perhaps, the utility firm said the device will ultimately allow the user to become ""active participants"" in the energy market, using smart contracts to enable switching between different sources of electricity and providing a ""transparent"" and secure view of the energy used from production to consumption.  For every kilowatt-hour of electricity used by the device, a transaction is confirmed on a blockchain network and a proof of origin is provided. ""This means that whether the energy comes from the photovoltaic system of the neighboring building or from the wind farm on the way to work, everyone decides themselves,"" Wien Energie said.  The two firms plan to trial the device with several customers ""in the coming months,"" and aim to soon roll it out a wider scale trial using an urban blockchain infrastructure developed by Wien Energie and blockchain firm Riddle & Code. For that trial, roughly 100 residents will help examine the effectiveness of being able to select electricity tariffs using blockchain tech and smart meters.  Peter Gönitzer, CEO of Wien Energie, said:  ""The blockchain infrastructure should enable new business models in the energy market. For example, an e-charging station could then use a computer protocol on the blockchain and automated contracts to purchase electricity from both the solar system on the roofs of a neighborhood and from the wholesale exchange and then market it to an electric car.""

42402743,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcnvT,1554484205,Bitrefill's 'Thor Turbo' Lets You Get Started With Bitcoin's Lightning Faster,"Bitrefill has launched a new service that seeks to simplify the process of setting up payment channels on the lightning network, the experimental, layer-two initiative being built on top of bitcoin.  Demoed for the first time Friday at the Understanding Bitcoin conference in Malta, the new service – dubbed ""Thor Turbo"" – helps users to get around a wrinkle in how lightning works today. Currently, users need to wait an hour to initialize a lightning channel, but with a technology that Bitrefill is calling ""turbo channels,"" they're looking to make that set-up process more smooth for would-be transactors.  It just goes to show, as promising as lightning is for scaling bitcoin, developers are still working out all the kinks.  Lightning, in general, is quite fast, allowing for transactions to be sent instantaneously, even across the world. But before users can take advantage of this speed, they first need to convert their bitcoin into lightning, which is generally not an instant process. Doing so takes six ""confirmations"" on the bitcoin blockchain, a wait of roughly 60 minutes, to know the transaction has been settled securely and the network has officially accepted the transaction.  With the new Thor Turbo app, users can bypass the initial wait by opening a “turbo channel” with Bitrefill of any size, which they can pay for in bitcoin, ethereum, dash, litecoin, dogecoin. Their technology is based on an idea by developer Martin Habovštiak, which was later put into practice by developer Anton Kumaigorodskiy in Bitcoin Lightning Wallet.  Bitrefill CCO John Carvalho said in a statement:  “We want to show the world what’s possible with 'layer 2' scaling technology. Words can’t do justice to the feeling of using bitcoin instantaneously. Everyone needs to try this, and once they do, they will never go back. This expands the entire paradigm of what’s possible for internet commerce.”  Bitrefill is one of the companies that's been following lightning the longest and most aggressively, even sending one of the first trial payments. The team launched Thor in January to make it easier to receive lightning payments. Thor Turbo is an additional feature that makes it faster for a user to get set up to send lightning payments.  That said, Bitrefill knows that the service it offers is risky, as the underlying lightning technology still has lingering bugs, making it risky to use.  ""Some will call us reckless, but we’re here to pull bitcoin forward and make onboarding the world to bitcoin and lightning as frictionless as possible,"" said Carvahlo.

42381769,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p28R,1554480660,"Tron Dapps Saw $1.6 Billion in Volume in Q1 2019, Driven By Gambling","Gambling is becoming a primary use case for the Tron blockchain, new data shows.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk by analytics firm Dapp Review, dapps on the tron network facilitated $1.6 billion in activity in the first quarter of 2019, with more than 432,000 estimated users. In total, 64 percent of dapps on the tron network now facilitate gambling, the study said.  These days, tron gambling apps range from digital dog racing to a “farm investment game” that promises players up to 100 times their initial token investment.  On the strength of such games, tron dapp volume surged to a new high in March 2019, according to Dapp Review’s data, with more than $102 million worth of transactions on March 15 alone – compared to roughly $16 million worth of volume the same day on EOS dapps and just under $4 million in daily volume on ethereum dapps.  Stepping back, Tron became independent from ethereum in June 2018 after the namesake Tron Foundation ran a $70 million token sale in 2017. Dapp Review CEO Vincent Niu told CoinDesk that EOS – another ethereum-inspired blockchain that also went live in June 2018 – surpassed ethereum when gamblers deterred by ethereum’s high fees flocked to EOS in late 2018.  The tron community took notice and began courting ethereum developers as well.  “In October 2018, we were contacted by representatives from the tron network and they asked us to participate in their accelerator,” Moscow-based Ruslan Marinov, founder of the casino dapp 888tron, told CoinDesk.  Tron gained its market advantage thanks to the popularity of such online gambling sites, Niu said.  Dapp Review’s Q1 2019 report estimates that 27 percent of tron dapps are casino games, with another 36 percent deemed “high risk” gambling games. The report found that just 37 percent of ethereum dapps that fall into both categories combined. (“High risk” gambling involves very little gameplay and a smart contract that determines payouts.)  Attracting developers  Tron founder Justin Sun, in particular, has been a catalyst to the growth of this sector.  Although the Tron Foundation released a statement in March discouraging unlawful gambling dapps in Japan, the founders of several global gambling dapps told CoinDesk they received $10,000 or more worth of the stablecoin Tether as rewards for building their games for the Tron Accelerator hackathon in December 2018.  According to a Tron spokesperson, those funds came from Sun’s personal accounts and not the company itself.  It’s unclear how involved the Tron Foundation is in financially bolstering this gambling sector, beyond listing the games on the company’s official websites. A Tron spokesperson declined to comment on dapp gambling. We will update the story if we hear back.  “The blockchain itself brings a lot of freedom to people from, for example, China,” 888tron’s Marinov said. “By using a VPN they can gamble or use many other services.”  While developers across the ecosystem continue to make gambling portals on many blockchains, Sun’s recruiting strategy appears to have been particularly effective.  According to data provided to CoinDesk by the blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, the price of tron tokens surged in early January, when these gambling dapps launched, and developer contributions have remained stable ever since.  However, Dapp Review’s Niu was less optimistic regarding overall engagement.  “Actually most of the users are just fake accounts,” he said. “If you look to the future, I’d say ethereum has more potential because a lot of people are working on token standards and other infrastructures.”  That said, Niu told CoinDesk that dapp transaction data suggests some players are merely using dapps to get tokens, especially in jurisdictions that forbid purchasing TRX with fiat.  On the other hand, EOS advocate and Sense CTO Ben Sigman told CoinDesk:  “People whose businesses and services are limited by governments are going to seek new areas to expand to where those limitations and laws aren’t present yet. That’s why gambling was a big part of the early internet too.”  Tokenized income  Niu said it’s still difficult for open-source developers to monetize their contributions to the blockchain ecosystem. Gambling dapps provide a conduit for such earnings, he said.  Marinov, for example, leads a team of 15 contributors. His token-fueled casino has an average of 1,500 daily users, which solely identify themselves with crypto wallet addresses. 888tron players bet TRX tokens and receive dapp dividend tokens for each bet, of which Marinov says $9 million worth of TRX dividends have already been paid out in the three months since launch.  “We have plans to organize a company, to set up an entity with the necessary licenses, all the legal stuff, starting in July of this year,” Marinov said. “We are investigating the best jurisdiction.”  Overall, Marinov estimated $300 million worth of TRX passed through the 888tron dapp alone.  In return, offering these developers prize money pays off tenfold for the Tron Foundation. Players cashing out 888tron dapp tokens contributed significant volume to the March 15 spike in tron dapp volume.  “Blockchain is the best solution for gambling and for gaming,” Marinov said. “Tron is a great blockchain. We were actually choosing from three blockchains, ethereum, EOS and tron. … They [the Tron Foundation] support developers.”  Roulette image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,TRX,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRX | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/05/tron-dapps-saw-16-billion-in-volume-in-q1-2019-driven-by-gambling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc6f8b6ea88040a0750ca341840eea0b5284cfcf-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm’s CEO, Alexey Miller, announced the news at a meeting with Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev Wednesday, saying Gazprom is now ""ready to start implementing the process"" of digitizing the gas supply process using distributed ledger technology in its operations.  Miller explained that, alongside the state-owned Gazprombank (a Gazprom subsidiary and Russia’s third-largest bank), ""we have developed a prototype of a technological platform to automate the process of concluding, monitoring and executing contracts. This system also provides for automated arbitrage and calculation of payments for gas.”  The system is accessible by all parties involved in the process and is “fully protected” from tampering and unauthorized alterations, he said.  Gazprom will initially start working with “major” industrial consumers to implement the blockchain-based automated processes, according to the CEO.  The prime minister was positive in his response, saying that blockchain technology has a “promising” future in the Russian economy, as well as in the activities of companies like Gazprom.  Gazprom has been experimenting with blockchain technology for some time. Last summer, its aviation refueling subsidiary Gazpromneft-Aero implemented blockchain and smart contract technologies to automate planning and accounting processes in fuel supplies.

42381757,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p1vr,1554465651,10 Passes to Go: Bitcoin's Lightning Torch Will Soon Burn Out,"Bitcoin's lightning torch will soon burn out, putting an end to a global payments experiment that has seen participation from hundreds of recipients, from tech luminaries like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to users in countries cut off from parts of the world by economic sanctions.  Users taking part in the venture have been showing the power of lightning's tech by passing a payment from one person to the next, adding a few cents worth of bitcoin with each step. The so-called ""torch"" has burned through at least 54 countries so far, showcasing its cross-border prowess.  But because of a hard-coded transaction limit of about $170 at time of press (it's officially 4.29 million satoshis), there's a limit on how much bitcoin can be sent across a lightning channel at once. As such, users will only be able to pass the torch less than a dozen more times before it hits that limit.  Once the torch payment hits the limit (which was put into place for safety reasons) people can no longer add 30 cents or so to the torch with each pass, as was the lightning torch tradition.  Of course, it's impossible to say what exactly what will happen to the torch until it dies out. Will the torch die out? Or, will someone simply start a new one?  The pseudonymous Hodlonaut, who started the lightning torch on a whim, has been counting down the remaining spots on Twitter (now down to 10), telling CoinDesk that he is not planning to start up a second torch.  When asked whether they're planning to start another torch as this one dies out, Hodlonaut responded: ""I don't think so. Maybe something else ;)""  Global experiment  The possible end to the lightning torch raises what might be an obvious question: what are the key takeaways?  Participants argue that, for better or worse, the lightning torch has shown that the technology is unstoppable, as it crossed into more than 50 countries with ease. If one country implements policies that are unfair, bitcoin can bypass this, because payments can't be stopped by any one person or entity.  In addition to passing through so many countries, that the torch was sent to Iran seemed to vindicate this view. Iranian bitcoin user Ziya Sadr tried to receive the torch, but some torch bearers were too scared to pass it to him due to U.S. sanctions potentially making it illegal to do so. But, when an unknown user from Wales passed Sadr the torch, it seemed to secure the view that bitcoin's lightning is borderless.  Sadr agrees with these sentiments. ""Bitcoin and lightning are truly censorship resistant and people manifested this too during this very public and bold experiment!"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Bitcoin is borderless and it will not conform to state-backed sanctions and national politics.""  According to bitcoin enthusiast and entrepreneur Akin Ferdinandez, the experiment ""showed clearly that the world is actually just one place, and with the right tools it’s possible to traverse national borders and reach everyone as if there were no barriers between anyone.""  ""The torch entering and leaving Iran unimpeded is all the proof you need to show this is true. People really can get along if given the chance,"" Ferdinandez told CoinDesk.  Hodlonaut also pointed out some of the lesser-known facts of the experiment. For example, a group of Venezuelans received the torch while the country was roiling amid a power outage. With no electricity, they powered their lightning node with a motorcycle battery.  Ferdinandez, who carried the torch last week, thinks it shows that even when a technology is early on, it can do good.  ""It also shows once again that a small number of people can have a hugely significant global impact in a short amount of time if their thinking is right and they have the focus and skills to execute in software,"" Ferdinandez (who also goes by the moniker Beautyon) told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The lesson here is, 'Do not underestimate bitcoin'.""  Lightning limitations  But while the experiment shows the latent promise of the technology, it also shows how unready it is, Charlie Lee, creator of litecoin, argued to CoinDesk.  ""I think the torch shows [that] using lightning by running one's own node and lightning is still not easy enough. Most torch holders end up using a custodial solution, which is not ideal,"" Lee told CoinDesk.  ""Custodial"" wallets like Bluewallet have recently sprung up. Lightning users, including those who have participated in the lightning torch, have flocked to them because they make lightning easier to use. They don't need to set up their own lightning node, a time-consuming process that requires a lot of hard drive space, for instance.  While this sounds great, it's ""not ideal"" as Lee put it, because custodial wallets have full control of users funds -- a characteristic that sort of defeats the purpose of bitcoin as a digital currency that users are intended to have complete control over.  ""We still have lots of work to do to make lightning easy to use,"" Lee said.  This technological immaturity is embedded in the very reason the lightning torch is near its end, about to reach its transaction limit. The limit is there for a reason, as it's one of the features put in place by developers to keep users safe since lightning is still a budding technology susceptible to bugs.  Accidental altruism  Another outcome of the experiment is it has unexpectedly turned into a crowd sourced charity project.  Once the torch hits the transaction limit, Hodlonaut and the community plans to donate the torch to the non-profit Bitcoin Venezuela, dedicated to spreading the word about bitcoin as a currency alternative in the economically troubled country.  Hodlonaut tweeted:  ""[These] guys really deserve all the support we can give them. They will receive the #LNTrustChain torch, but that only amounts to around $170.""  To expand the donation effort to not only just the few who get to carry the lightning torch, Hodlonaut started a parallel donation effort on Tallycoin, a fundraising platform accepting solely bitcoin and lightning payments.  Without a transaction limit to worry about, the fundraiser has snowballed much more money than the torch, attracting has attracted 235 donations totaling 0.38672 bitcoin, worth about $1,553 at time of press.

The networking platform for professionals published the list on Wednesday, ranking Coinbase at number 35, 9 spots ahead of JPMorgan at number 44. No other cryptocurrency or blockchain firm made the list.  Coinbase has predominantly hired staff in engineering, IT and human resources roles in the recent past, and has a current headcount of about 600 employees in the U.S., the report indicated. The exchange’s employees can choose to be paid partially or entirely in bitcoin, and around 40 percent have some portion of their salary allocated to cryptocurrency.  CoinDesk has previously reported how the exchange offers above industry standard perks in order to retain staff. The firm has offered employees up to $5,000 a year for treatments like egg-freezing. The benefit, which lets women focus on their career for a time and conceive children later, is provided in addition to Coinbase’s health insurance options.  According to LinkedIn, JPMorgan, on the other hand, has focused its recent hires across finance, engineering and business development. It has also been “aggressively” preparing for the next generation of banking, with investments of $10.8 billion a year to fund a team of 50,000 technologists, which is “more than Twitter and Facebook combined,” the report states.  Earlier in February, the bank notably revealed its own stablecoin token called JPM Coin, which is “the first-ever cryptocurrency created by a U.S. bank,” LinkedIn added.  Topping LinkedIn's list of preferred employers is Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, followed by Facebook and Amazon at number two and three, respectively.  Three of the “Big Four” professional consultancy firms – Deloitte (at number 5), PwC (30) and EY (33) – also appear on the list.  LinkedIn said it rates U.S. firms’ popularity by analyzing their performance across four categories: interest in the company, engagement with employees, job demand and employee retention.  Late last year, LinkedIn also published a report on emerging jobs, noting that the role of blockchain developer had jumped straight to the top after interest rose 33-fold in just a year.

The tech partner on the project, R3-affiliated Instant Property Network (IPN), announced Thursday that the trial used test data to carry out simulated property transactions over a distributed ledger system over a five day period. The effort, the firm said, demonstrated that the real estate buying and selling process could be reduced from more than three months to ""less than three weeks.""  Currently, the property market uses a paper and email-based approach, which is “complex, slow, and inefficient,"" IPN said. There are generally at least eight parties involved in each property transaction, besides the buyer and seller, all of whom have to go through the process of sharing information involving many documents, platforms and databases. That leads to “delays in transactions, errors, increased costs and uncertainty for all parties,"" said the firm.  Using blockchain technology for the process could save the global property market about $160 billion annually, IPN suggested.  Dan Salmons, director for mortgage innovation at RBS, said:  “What has made a real difference here is that R3 has brought representatives of all the key parties involved in the process together, so as a result we can see the potential for a network of this kind to improve transparency and speed for customers, and reduce cost and complexity for all involved.”  IPN claims to have created a system where participants in a real estate sale can transact directly and retain control over their own data. The firm said it is now onboarding “dozens” of more private and public sector firms for the next phase of the project, and is targeting September for the release of the next version of its platform.  Other participants in the trial included U.S.-based law firm Squire Patton Boggs, U.K.-based law firms Ashurst and Clifford Chance, and property data firm Search Acumen, according to the announcement.  Commenting on the effort, R3 CEO David Rutter said, ""Not only has it shown that distributed applications work and the benefits are real and substantial, it has also shown that there is huge appetite in the market to evaluate it.”  Home for sale image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/05/barclays-rbs-r3-cut-property-transaction-times-in-blockchain-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ca451d96fa85e658f8492e2f07437c56e2cecc5-1500x896.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exchange plans potential roles for its new ""eCAD"" token in cross-border payments and remittance, peer-to-peer lending, merchant payment solutions, as well as trade settlements and forex conversions.  Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond said in an announcement Thursday:  “The launch of eCAD will create the first transparent, affordable, and secure way of transferring value in Canada and beyond, without the risk of instability in the traditional cryptocurrency market.”  The firm pledged that each eCAD token will have one Canadian dollar backing it in reserve. While it claimed transparency in the announcement, it did not detail if and how proof of its reserves might be made public.  The news follows Coinsquare’s recent acquisition of decentralized exchange (DEX) StellarX for an undisclosed amount. StellarX is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Coinsquare and is based in Bermuda.  Coinsquare is backed by financial services firm Canaccord Genuity, having raised $30 million in equity financing back in early 2018. The funding, the exchange said at the time, “will be used to fuel a global growth plan and diversification strategy focused on making the platform even more responsive to mainstream customers’ needs.""  The platform was recently identified as a ""low risk"" exchange by reg-tech startup Coinfirm, due to having licenses and strict know-your-customer (KYC)/anti-money laundering (AML) policies in place.  The launch comes amid something of a flood of stablecoin launches over the last year. Most recently, cryptocurrency startup TrustToken launched a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the British pound and crypto exchange Bittrex, along with five other blockchain firms, announced a euro-pegged stablecoin that can be staked to earn returns.  The oldest and still the most used stablecoin, tether (USDT), which has been controversial for its lack of independent audits of its reserves, recently announced that its collateral backing the token may not be 100 percent in U.S. dollars.
