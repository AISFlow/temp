42397140,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtGA,1366749326,Alt-currency firm BizX nabs $700k,"Bitcoin isn't the only alternative currency enjoying some momentum and buzz these days. BizX, an 11-year-old company that provides a trading mechanism for its BizX dollars, just scored $700,000 in Series A funding from angel investors ... its first outside investment ever.  Based in Bellevue, Washington, the company is different from bitcoin in that its alternative currency doesn't involve currency exchanges. Instead, it functions as an alternative trading mechanism for roughly 2,500 firms, in a closed-loop system that is similar to a bartering network. BizX takes between 12 and 15 percentage for each transaction.  The company, which reported 2011 revenues of $9.8 million, brokered around $60 million in transactions last year.  Founded with $65,000 in 2002, BizX has been busy growing its list of participating businesses over the last decade. Now, with plans for a large expansion, it decided it needed outside funding. It got its financing from a group backed by Seattle investors Andy Liu (CEO of BuddyTV) and Rudy Gadre, a veteran of Facebook and Amazon.  ""The main difference between bitcoin and BizX is that there are real brick-and-mortar businesses trading our currency each day,"" said Julia Christman, a marketing consultant at Atlas Accelerator and now also marketing director at BizX.  Atlas builds sales operations for clients, figuring out how to monetize products and building sales teams and marketing channels. That mission ties in with BizX's stated objective for its new $700,000 cash injection: to expand its business coverage nationwide.  ""We are investing in technology. We are going to ramp up our website, make it easier to search, and introduce some mobile applications to make payments easier,"" Christman said. The company will also improve the transparency of its website, opening it up to show a list of which businesses are trading with BizX.  ""We will introduce a smaller entrepreneurial product,"" Christman added. ""We are going to make it easier for lots of businesses to participate.""  BizX keeps its currency constant at one BizX dollar to one US dollar. The idea behind the currency is to enable businesses to find alternative ways to acquire new customers while also conserving cash.  ""In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, cash was king, but it was very tight for a lot of businesses, who didn’t have access,"" Christman said. ""BizX provides an alternative place for business to trade, whether cash is tied up in something, or whether businesses want to keep cash in reserve. They are not limiting themselves. The peace of mind is very real.""  BizX also offers a line of credit for businesses, and Christman says that companies who can't get a line of credit from a bank can come to BizX as an alternative.  The alternative currency is taxable under US law. Companies create an additional bank account in their general ledger to record all transactions made on the BizX platform. When companies make a sale, they simply credit the revenue account, and debit the BizX account, in keeping with double-entry bookkeeping principles.  BizX maintains offices in Seattle and San Francisco, but it isn't an entirely domestic company. The firm also has a Dubai office, which it opened in 2007. Why Dubai? Possibly because its largest-ever transaction took place there, when the local Audi, VW and Porsche dealer Al Nabooda Automobiles sold 28 brand new Audi vehicles to a media company for 2.3m BizX dollars. (BizX has international aspirations, and announced plans at the time to expand to expand its international bartering hub.)  The company also has affiliates in Singapore, Turkey, Malaysia, the UK and Australia.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/23/alt-currency-firm-bizx-nabs-700k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/187607ed648aee259225a8da389047e394088325-600x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424825,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWkDh,1366745343,"Security guru confesses, 'I couldn't hack bitcoin'","Bitcoin may have been through some hard times lately, what with DDoS attacks, exchanges closing down and massive price fluctuations. But one renowned security expert is defending its basic resilience.  Dan Kaminsky  thinks it's OK.  Writing in Business Insider, Kaminsky says he tried to hack bitcoin two years ago, and failed. This is a big admission coming from Kaminsky, who has serious credentials: in 2008, he discovered a fundamental flaw in the internet domain naming system (DNS). (That's the part of the internet that tells your web browser where to go to fetch a webpage, and it is vital to the functioning of the world wide web.)  The odds -- before he tried his hack -- were stacked against bitcoin, Kaminsky writes. The digital currency uses an enormous cloud of machines that are always on and listening to the internet. It uses a proprietary protocol, and is written in C++, which is a language that, when used badly, is easily subverted with security exploits. Moreover, the financial gain for those hacking the system is huge.  ""The core technology actually works, and has continued to work, to a degree not everyone predicted,"" he now concedes. ""Time to enjoy being wrong.""  Kaminsky argues that bitcoin's high financial stakes actually change the game, leading to better programming and eliminating the security bugs he would normally look for.  The size of the system, which includes a huge ""accounts ledger"" for every account in the form of the blockchain, makes it difficult to subvert, he adds. There are enough nodes in the bitcoin system to always keep a copy of that blockchain, making it hard to spend bitcoins that have been stolen without being spotted.  Although bitcoins have been stolen in several high profile incidents, all of the pilfered coins can be monitored in the future, Kaminsky argues.  ""As far as I've seen none of the stolen bitcoin(s) have actually been spent in any way,"" he writes.  Bitcoin's next problem? Concentration of power, Kaminsky warns:  ""The 'official truth' of what money has changed hands is really in the hands of (fewer) than five or 10 organizations, and that's being generous,"" he warns, adding that those with the most resource will be able to mine the mostcoins because of their ability to invest in specialist mining rigs, thus propagating the centralization of power.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/23/security-guru-confesses-i-couldnt-hack-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424815,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWjzh,1366737262,From 'Cokehead currency' to Robin Hood heroics?,"Using bitcoins to transfer charitable donations from rich countries to poor ones could not only benefit people in need but help save the digital currency from government regulations or an outright ban, according to one Wall Street analyst.  In a blog post at TabbFORUM, Nicholas Colas, group chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, writes that bitcoin is ""ideally suited"" to the purpose of taking in money in rich countries and efficiently moving it to places with limited financial infrastructure.  ""That move alone would begin to remove the 'Cokehead currency' imprimatur which bitcoin still struggles to overcome due to some early press about its use on illegal drug distribution websites,"" Colas asserts. ""If shutting down bitcoin would hurt worthwhile charities by pushing them back into a higher-cost banking system, regulators might think twice about excessive regulation or an outright ban.""  Colas acknowledges the ""huge challenge"" venture capitalists face in first ensuring that bitcoin is user-friendly and secure:  ""Hackers in bitcoin land are ferocious competition, attacking the weakest link in the system to drive prices down,"" he writes. ""They then scoop up the currency during the confusion and wait for it to rebound.""  Colas recommends that venture capitalists address the security issues of the system first, and then work on making bitcoin a relevant currency for global financial transactions.  ""If the venture capital community wants to make bitcoin the 'Next big thing', staving off regulation by bringing the currency into the light is just as important as their other goals.""  Colas concludes that bitcoin remains a ""beta currency,"" and its success or failure rests with resolving technological challenges and business development issues. For now, that means bitcoin investors will continue to face high risk.  ""Investing in bitcoin has been a white-knuckle ride so far, and nothing in its near future points to a different trajectory. How it all shakes out, however, will be both instructive to watch and potentially profitable for those on the right side of this very novel trade,"" he writes.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/23/from-cokehead-currency-to-robin-hood-heroics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/503c53298ce3210bcf5048040f9ccd3193559991-600x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424809,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWjph,1366684017,Could bitcoin be a government plot?,"Could the non-government-supported, non-central-bank-backed bitcoin actually have been created by a government agency? The question has been buzzing in recent days after Paul Graham, co-founder of the tech incubator Y Combinator, explored some possibilities in a blog post:  ""I've long suspected bitcoin was created by a government,"" Graham writes. ""Bulletproof protocols usually require peer review, yet there have been zero leaks from the reviewers. Pools of crypto guys who don't leak stuff are usually employed by governments.""  Why would a government do this? Graham suggests possible financing for black ops, a race to create its own model for a digital currency before someone else did and fears that the US dollar might one day no longer be the global currency of choice.  ""I realize some of these explanations are pretty far fetched, but so is an individual cooking up bitcoin as an intellectual exercise,"" Graham wrote. ""Whatever the explanation of bitcoin's origin turns out to be, it will probably be pretty weird.""  While responses to Graham's post have run the gamut -- ranging from complete dismissal of the possibility of government involvement (""If it were part of the Governments (sic) opererational plans, you wouldn't have public officials condemning it in public,"" writes Bitcoin Forum member TraderTimm) to an embrace of various conspiracies, others say the answer doesn't matter.  ""At this point, who cares who came up with bitcoin or how?"" notes Bitcoin Forum member Dabs. ""Government or some Japanese guy, it doesn't matter. The current code is open source and the protocol is defined.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/23/could-bitcoin-be-a-government-plot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
