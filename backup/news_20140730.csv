42376231,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwL5Qb,1406760142,Patrick Byrne: Overstock Exploring Block Chain-Based Public Stock Offering,"Overstock.com has proved itself to be a pioneer in bitcoin advocacy, helping push a number of major merchants to consider accepting digital currency when it became the first marquee name to do so this January.  Now, in a new interview with CoinDesk, CEO Patrick Byrne has opened up about how Overstock may be seeking to further develop its plans for promoting decentralisation in the global financial market.  The Utah-based e-commerce giant launched a new open-source wiki page on its website on 29th July. Entitled 'How to issue a cryptosecurity', the page provides a broad overview of the topic, and lists the pros and cons of the various major players in the marketplace including Counterparty, Ethereum and NXT. The offerings all allow users to trade securities person to person, without a centralised mediator such as a stock exchange.  Speaking to CoinDesk about the wiki, Byrne confirmed that the page seeks to crowdsource opinion from the digital currency community so that the company can shape its stance on whether it would be able to introduce such an offering.  Choosing his words carefully, Byrne said:  ""I can't say that we have the intention to actually do it, but I can say that my intention is as firm as the intention can get while being still exploratory. If it gets any more solid, I will have to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).""  If introduced, Overstock would be the first publicly traded company to also offer a cryptosecurity as an option to investors. Byrne suggested any Overstock offering, should it move past the exploratory phase, would not be focused on raising revenue, saying:  ""If we hypothetically issued such stock, it would really be in a small amount. [...] We're doing it because we want to figure out how to do it and show how to do it [so] other people can fund their companies using the system we develop.""  Cryptocurrency crowdsales  have become an increasingly popular and sometimes contentious way for bitcoin startups to launch and raise money, with leading Canadian exchange CAVIRTEX and the now defunct Neo & Bee providing notable examples of the varying results produced so far through this approach.  Eliminating corruption  Throughout the conversation, Byrne stressed that he believes that cryptosecurities have the potential to vastly impact the traditional investment industry.  Noting how he thinks cryptosecurities could be even more powerful than cryptocurrencies in the long term, Byrne remarked:  ""If every payment went to bitcoin, it would be a $16tn industry. If every exchange on the stock market went to a cryptosecurity it would be a $4qn industry.""  Byrne went on to suggest that he believes the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) – a financial services company that provides clearing and settlement for the majority of US securities transactions, should be disintermediated by a block chain-based solution, and that doing so could prove more valuable to society than replacing central banks.  ""The central bank is not good institutional design, it's bad institutional design,"" Byrne said. ""It's good people trying to do the right thing. [...] In the case of the DTCC, I think that it's a corrupt organization that shows [the] influence of organized crime.""  Cryptosecurities, he asserted, hold the potential to eradicate the need for such centralized parties, and any steps toward this future, he suggested, would be beneficial.  How the offering could work  Though the specifics of a final offering would likely be shaped by the cryptosecurities exchange platform Overstock chooses, the end result would aim to be similar to a traditional common stock, with the same associated economic and legal rights.  Byrne stated:  ""Hypothetically, we would want to make it as close to an equivalent to our common stock as possible and trade at the same price.""  Speaking to CoinDesk in the past, some of the burgeoning cryptosecurity sector's major players acknowledged that the legality of securities trading using decentralised block chain-based platforms is still murky, especially as laws around traditional crowdfunding remain opaque.  Still, without guidance from the SEC, Byrne suggested that Overstock could seek to be the company that raises the issue, adding:  ""We're open-sourcing how to create an alternative to the current corrupt institutions that dominate Wall Street. If their lap dog, the SEC, subpoenas me, I intend to open-source their subpoena and open-source my response. And when the DOJ indicts me, I'll post that online and we'll open-source our response to that.""  Obstacles ahead  Should Overstock go ahead with such a proposal, it acknowledges it would likely encounter a number of issues. The wiki page currently names transaction recordkeeping and legal requirements, for example, as two areas that need further clarity.  In part, Byrne explained, the company's new wiki page is an attempt to find solutions to these obstacles. He said:  ""We're basically open-sourcing the answers. Instead of asking some law firm to spend $1m to try and figure it out, we're turning it over to the world and say 'Hey you folks who want to see this happen, come and help figure out some of these questions on our wiki'.""  Still, Byrne cautioned that while he's enthusiastic about the project, the SEC will have the final say on whether Overstock could even issue a cryptosecurity.  ""I agree that it's too exploratory to do now, but that's why we have the blank wiki page,"" Byrne said. ""As the issues get resolved on that wiki page it will become less and less risky.""  In particular, Byrne suggested that Overstock is hoping securities lawyers and stockbrokers can contribute to the page as it continues to explore the possible offering.

42377485,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UZx,1406756766,Tokyo Police Launch Investigation into Missing Mt. Gox Bitcoin,"The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has launched an official investigation into possible illicit activity surrounding the closure of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  The news comes roughly five months after the bitcoin exchange reported it lost roughly 744,400 BTC – then about $350m in customer funds, and about one month since Mt. Gox was approved for its Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the US.  A spokesperson for the police department told The Wall Street Journal:  “We decided to launch an investigation as we concluded this case could be connected to criminal activity.""  Tokyo police told the media outlet that they suspect roughly 27,000 BTC were stolen from the website.  Using past figures, however, as many as 544,000 BTC could theoretically be uncovered by the investigation, as Mt. Gox later confirmed that it found 200,000 BTC in an old bitcoin wallet in March, reducing its total estimated number of lost bitcoins.  Investigation ongoing  The news, while vague as to how police will seek to carry out their mandate, is potentially encouraging to former exchange users still waiting for any action that could help recover their lost assets.  Lawyers representing the exchange's former users and current creditors, for instance, have reported that they have been blocked from conducting any fact-finding into Mt. Gox KK, the company's Japanese entity, since it was granted initial bankruptcy protection in the US.  Still, in comments to CoinDesk, representatives of the Edelson law firm suggested that they believe that any wrongdoing was perhaps the result of activity at the exchange itself, not necessarily any outside parties. It is unclear whether the new investigation is focusing on the company or on any alleged cybercriminal activity.  Mt. Gox has officially maintained that it lost the customer funds because hackers were able to exploit bitcoin's transaction malleability – a process by which exchanges between Mt. Gox users were identified, though this claim was widely disputed by the community.  Police activity escalates  The announcement also comes amid an alleged increase in police activity related to digital currency in Japan.  For example, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry first introduced a plan for how it would monitor illicit trade involving digital currency this May. This initiative would find the government agency working with other peer organisations such as the Financial Services Agency and National Police Agency.  That same month, police forces in Tokyo and Fukuoka carried out what was said to be the country's first bitcoin-related arrest, when a 38-year-old bitcoin user was arrested for allegedly importing illegal stimulants.

42377492,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UgF,1406752220,New York's BitLicense Proposal: The View from China,"Since the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) released its proposed regulations for bitcoin businesses on 17th July, the wider digital currency community has been locked in a heated debate over what the passage of the policies would mean for the future of the nascent industry.  As put forth by Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis in a recent CoinDesk opinion piece, the growing consensus in the Western world, if one can be derived, is that the NYDFS framework goes too far, threatening to stifle innovation in its bid to protect consumers.  If true, the NYDFS proposal could be as troubling to the global bitcoin industry as the US market – a concern backed up by recent statements from US Congressman Steve Stockman. International bitcoin companies are also likely to be influenced by New York's policies, especially as an increasing number of global players seek to expand their presence by tapping the lucrative US market and global regulators look to the US for guidance on how to shape their own policies.  One market that has been paying close attention to New York's proposed rules is China, where major bitcoin exchanges OKCoin, Huobi and BTC China have all recently announced initiatives that aim to capture international US dollar market share, though they stop short of courting US buyers directly due to the lack of current regulatory clarity.  Speaking to CoinDesk, China's major exchanges struck varied tones on the proposed regulation.  Robert Kuhne, a spokesperson for Huobi, summed up the more positive sentiment, noting that it is optimistic about the general discourse despite criticisms with the original proposal:  ""The New York bitlicense decree was clearly a case of executive branch overreach, and there will be a lot of push-back from the public. The strong reaction that we have already seen from the bitcoin community gives us a lot of confidence in the future of bitcoin in the US.""  Its rival OKCoin, however, has adopted a vastly different outlook. Contrary to perception in the Western world that China's regulatory environment has been problematic for the industry, the exchange asserted that it views the current proposals as far more troubling.  ""China only seems 'uncertain' to the people who are not familiar with it,"" the exchange said in official remarks. ""We certainly hope China will not adopt regulations like the ones currently proposed in New York.""  Kuhne went on to suggest that, although he can't predict how China will react to bitcoin long term, US policy on the matter will likely service as a ""reference point"" for decision-making.  Work in progress  On the whole, bitcoin's China-based companies largely applauded New York for taking the first step toward a framework for the industry, acknowledging the difficulties inherent in implementing rules for what could be one of history's most disruptive technologies.  A representative from BTC China, the country's oldest bitcoin exchange, stopped short of criticising the proposal, but suggested that the company feels the document is still a work in progress, and therefore can be improved:  ""We applaud the New York financial regulators for proactively laying the groundwork for bitcoin regulation. We think the best thing for the US market, and the broader bitcoin economy, would be to provide entrepreneurs with a smart, uniform framework in which to innovate, while keeping barriers to entry low and the market competitive.""  Kuhne suggested that regardless of New York's final rules, the bitcoin community will simply adapt to the new regulatory terrain, adding:  ""The US has better regulations than many countries but worse than others. The great thing about the Internet economy is that businesses are not limited by geography.""  'Bad for business'  Still, others in China's digital currency community are highly critical of the proposals.  Changpeng Zhao  , chief technology officer at China's largest bitcoin exchange, OKCoin, said he personally feels that the rules go too far, particularly the provisions that call for businesses to obtain photo IDs and addresses for all customers.  Cautioning that his views don't necessarily reflect those of OKCoin, Zhao told CoinDesk:  ""While knowing what the rules are in the bitcoin space generally helps, the New York proposed regulations is definitely not good for our business, or any bitcoin business for that matter. It is 'big brother' to the extreme.""  Furthermore, should the regulations be enacted, bitcoin businesses may choose not to service New York-based customers, a development that could have long-term implications, Zhao said.  He added: ""It will likely impede innovation in New York when it comes to bitcoins, and will likely erode New York as a leading financial center over time.""  OKCoin's manager of international operations Zane Tackett, offered a similarly broad critique.  ""As an international exchange with the vast majority of our customers being non-American, forcing of us to disclose our entire user base, their identity, their address and general info to the US government is absurd, unreasonable and overreaching,"" Tackett said, adding:  ""Why should we have to give the US government personal information on someone who isn't an American citizen, isn't in America, has never been to America, nor will ever go to America?""  Long-term outlook positive  Although New York's proposed regulation was met with criticism by the Chinese companies, most maintained optimism about the potential of the US market.  Huobi's Kuhne emphasized that the US remains a primary target for Huobi as it looks abroad, saying:  ""We are attracted by the US market for a lot of reasons. Not only its sheer size and purchasing power, but also its status as a technological, financial, and cultural leader in the world.""  OKCoin, in its official response, took a markedly different tone, stating:  ""The proposed regulations definitely don’t instill confidence. There are certain sections of the proposed regulations, which as an international company are not favorable.""  In particular, the exchange cited stipulations that would require it to provide employee fingerprints and disclose personal information, as well as the limitations on maintaining profits in permissible investments.  Still, while China's major exchanges are observing the situation, only one – OKCoin – is seeking to weigh in on the proposal during its current 45-day comment period.  The company told CoinDesk:  ""The entire bitcoin community needs to participate in the comment period. We will do our share.""  While that exchange has confirmed it will be submitting comments on the regulation, BTC China and Huobi have told CoinDesk they will not do so, preferring to take a wait-and-see approach.  Consumers apathetic  Betty Zhang, a correspondent for China-based bitcoin news source Bitell indicated that, while China's businesses may be paying attention, the proposals have failed to impact China's bitcoin discussion the way China's regulatory uncertainty has hit home in the US.  ""The NYDFS regulation didn't arouse much interest or concern here,"" Zhang told CoinDesk. ""Few people discussed or expressed any comment regarding it on Chinese bitcoin forums. I guess this is because, firstly, it's not happening in China, so many people are unconcerned; secondly even the draft is passed into law and imitated by China, it might not be bad news.""  Zhang, however, best summed up the wider optimism that the proposal would be amended, thus setting the tone for smart regulation internationally, stating:  ""Hopefully in [the] 45-day public comment period, it can be revised and improved. Regulation at a reasonable extent is a good thing.""

42377479,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UR9,1406746862,"Armory's 'Lockbox' Brings Multisig to Storage, Escrow and More","Open-source wallet management platform Armory Technologies has released Lockbox, a new multi-signature interface for bitcoin.  Version 0.92  of the Armory client now has a new user interface that allows users to carry out multi-signature transactions, offering claimed ""high-security storage"", as well as opening up new possibilities for bitcoin contracts and escrow services.  The Armory client lets users manage multiple wallets and maintain offline wallets, as well as other features.  Flexible multisig  Armory  says its new Lockboxes do not require any third-party services and that they give users complete control over the generation and storage of all cryptographic keys.  Furthermore, each Armory signing device can generate its own wallet even when it is offline – a useful feature for keeping bitcoin in 'cold storage', away from the inherent risks of Internet-linked devices.  The company says Lockboxes are very flexible, allowing users to choose any multi-signature combination from 1-of-2 up to 7-of-7, with each increase requiring more signatures to release funds from the wallet.  The company said:  ""There are many possible ways to use lockboxes. A basic 2-of-2 scheme may be appropriate for a husband and wife who want their savings to require both of their signatures. A complex 5-of-7 scheme may be appropriate for a large financial institution or hedge fund desiring to widely distribute signing authority among trusted executives, trustees, or even insurance providers.""  Armory says that most other multi-signature services only provide a single type of multi-signature and also require third-party services or signers. The fact that such systems generate multiple private keys on the same system, which then pass through the same channel, creates a ""point of failure"" in the system, the company asserts.  Crowdfunding contracts  Armory 0.92 also features support for simultaneous funding or 'simulfunding', which is basically a simple bitcoin contract. All parties involved in a funding effort need to specify how much they are willing to contribute, then combine the contributions into a single contract-backed transaction.  The transaction is finalized only when the contract is executed in full, in which case, all the funds are transferred at the same time. If the contract is not executed, no transaction takes place. The bitcoin network enforces the agreement, eliminating the need for trust between the parties.  The company said:  ""Armory is the first wallet to implement this powerful feature and make it accessible to advanced users. Additional use cases could include crowdfunding, donation drives or even roommate rent collection.""  Armory is demonstrating the simulfunding feature with a donation drive valued at 20 BTC, with the funds going to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Free Software Foundation and the College Cryptocurrency Network. Armory promises to match the donations with a further 20 BTC contribution of its own.  The company says it is on track to release Armory version 1.0 soon and that it will include a new API for enterprise integration and a 'supernode' mode that it claims will ""replace the need for third-party services in your bitcoin management platform"".

42377487,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UYh,1406744720,Overstock to Extend Bitcoin Payments to Global Customers,"UPDATE (2nd September 6:20 BST): An Overstock spokesperson has told CoinDesk that its international payments rollout has been met with development delays. He said: ""We’re now quite confident that the feature will be live on 4th September.""  UPDATE (1st September 23:00 BST): Reddit users began reporting that bitcoin payments were not yet available on the company's international websites.  UPDATE (20th August 10:06 BST): Patrick Byrne has said that bitcoin payments on Overstock's international website will go live on 1st September. The CEO revealed the news in an interview with The New York Times.      Patrick Byrne, CEO of e-commerce giant Overstock.com, has announced that the company intends to expand its bitcoin payments program to international customers in the next four to six weeks.  To date, the option to pay for purchases in bitcoin has only been available to US customers, in what has become a similar offering for the industry's major merchants. Dell, for example, only allows US-based customers to pay in bitcoin, while Expedia limits the offering to its US website.  Notably, TigerDirect, which uses BitPay for its processing, has expanded its offering to Canada.  News of the international payment option first surfaced during a TV interview Byrne gave to Russia-based, English-language news source RT's 'Boom Bust' program.  Byrne said in the broadcast:  ""In about one month to six weeks, we'll be introducing bitcoin to our international customers, so [customers], including those in Russia, will be able to pay in bitcoins.""  Throughout the interview, Byrne was overwhelmingly positive about his company's experience with bitcoin, lauding the service provided by its merchant processing provider Coinbase and saying that it ""hasn't had a hiccup since we started"".  ""We've integrated with all kinds of payment systems and this is the first that I can think of where there's been no hiccups at all,"" Byrne added.  Byrne further revealed that the company is now issuing refunds in bitcoin, and that its customer service agents have been facilitating the offering for one month.  Market influencer  Byrne also used the interview to further position Utah-based Overstock as a major influence within the broader e-commerce community, noting that he believes the company's announcement marked a milestone in bitcoin merchant adoption.  Byrne said:  ""We like to think that we broke the ice, I think before us the biggest merchant was about $1m, so by us doing it, we're a billion-and-a-half-dollar merchant, we like to think we saved [bitcoin] about four to five years of evolution.""  The CEO went on to say that, even from a purely public relations standpoint, bitcoin is a no-brainer for other similarly sized businesses.  ""We got fantastic PR from [accepting bitcoin],"" Byrne said. ""Now, that it's broken into the billion-dollar vendor market, it's just a matter of time before the other dominoes fall.""  Expecting success  In his comments, Byrne suggested that bitcoin purchases now account for one-quarter of 1% of the company's sales, but that the pace of sales from this market segment is increasing.  Byrne went on to state that he believes both international sales and time will boost this figure, stating:  ""This isn't just a US phenomenon, this is happening all around the world.""  Coinbase confirmed to CoinDesk that should Overstock seek to expand its bitcoin payments program it can do so with its services. The company pointed to its recent integration with global e-commerce and logistics solutions provider Bongo International as an example of a partner that accepts global payments.

42377493,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71Uez,1406740752,Wikipedia Now Accepts Bitcoin Donations,"Open-source online encyclopedia Wikipedia is now accepting bitcoin through a new partnership with Coinbase.  The Wikimedia Foundation, which owns and curates Wikipedia, announced on its official blog that it is now accepting donations in the digital currency.  The organization cited grassroots community support for the integration, saying that demand for bitcoin support led to discussions on the leadership level.  The announcement is notable given the Foundation’s past apprehension toward the idea of accepting bitcoin. In March, the organization announced that it was beginning to discuss bitcoin donations, but co-founder Jimmy Wales later commented that Wikimedia was taking a “cautious” approach.  In the blog post, Wikimedia chief revenue officer Lisa Gruwell said that the discussion process was in-depth, but with more clarification available on the legal status of digital currency, Wikimedia was able to move forward.  She wrote:  “Currently, we accept 13 different payment methods enabling donations from nearly every country in the world, and today, we’re adding one more: bitcoin.”  In a separate email sent to Wikipedia supporters, the organization said that the goal is to offer ""flexible"" payment options to those who donate to keep the online encyclopedia running. With bitcoin, the Foundation declared, Wikipedia supporters can enjoy greater versatility in their donation options.  One more way to give  The reason for the prior apprehension, the organization said, was the operational and legal complexity and uncertainties surrounding bitcoin.  But the Foundation leadership cited its partnership with Coinbase as a method for sidestepping some of the logistical needs that come with accepting bitcoin, which includes the occasional need to exchange bitcoin for fiat currency.  According to the Wikimedia blog post:  ""Using Coinbase, a bitcoin exchange, we’re able to immediately convert bitcoin to U.S. dollars, requiring minimal technical implementation on our end. Since we now also have guidance on how to account for bitcoin, there is a clear understanding of how to legally manage it.""  Speaking with CoinDesk, Coinbase director of business development Adam White remarked that the Foundation took the slow and steady approach to make sure that it maintained full legal compliance. But once those concerns were addressed, ""that gave wikipedia enough confidence to say let's move forward with this and choose a solution"", he said.  Among the benefits discussed includes the option for small donations, which is attractive for a platform like Wikipedia that runs on the support of its global readership.  Notably, White told CoinDesk that the Wikipedia integration marks the largest non-profit to accept the digital currency to date.  With the integration now active, all users have to do is go to Wikipedia’s donation page and opt to pay in bitcoin. Like with any option, users can choose to make either one-time or recurring donations to the free encyclopedia.

They just want to know that it works and how it affects them.

42377481,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71USP,1406726793,BitPay Offers 'Free and Unlimited' Payment Processing for Merchants,"One of bitcoin's leading merchant processors, BitPay, has introduced a new pricing plan that makes its basic level of service free and unlimited.  The new plan allows merchants unlimited use of any plugin, API or app from the BitPay library and access to the company’s email support.  BitPay  executive chairman Tony Gallippi framed the announcement as one that would support the company as it seeks to meet its ambitious merchant enrollment goals:  “We have set a goal to enroll 1 million merchants by the end of 2016 […] When we started BitPay in 2011, we saw an opportunity to finally give merchants around the world relief from interchange fees. By offering a basic plan that is free and unlimited, forever, we give merchants yet another reason to be excited about bitcoin.”  The company's business and enterprise plans, which offer customers additional features, will continue at existing prices.  Pricing change  The new pricing plan helps further reduce the barrier to entry for new merchants that are looking to accept bitcoin payments.  Previously, BitPay’s basic pricing plan was available to merchants at a cost of $30 for 30 days, for transactions of up to $10,000 daily.  By contrast, Coinbase’s processing service has been free for merchants that want to receive and keep payments in bitcoin. The wallet provider and payment processor – and main competitor to BitPay – charges a 1% fee for merchants wanting to exchange their bitcoin sales’ earnings for dollars, but only after the company's first $1m in sales.  Merchant focus  The move returns BitPay's attention to its core service, as it has recently been focusing efforts on its consumer platforms. Earlier this month, BitPay introduced Get Bits, a Facebook app that helps friends trade bitcoin, as well as the beta version of its multi-signature wallet, Copay.  The company has more than 35,000 merchants in its network, including WordPress, Virgin Galactic, TigerDirect, Newegg and e-commerce marketplace platform Shopify. However, in recent months, Coinbase has also partnered with marquee names like Dell, Dish Network, Expedia and 1-800-Flowers.  Further heightening the competition between the companies, this month, Shopify – whose payments processor was BitPay, initially – added Coinbase as a second option for its merchants.  The intent, the company told CoinDesk, was that the processing services might “innovate a bit more” so that customers might benefit.

42377491,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71Udj,1406724475,Bitcoins Affected by New York's BitLicense May Trade at Discount,"With New York's BitLicense scheme officially three months away, sophisticated traders are already devising strategies to profit from the potential arbitrage opportunities.  If implemented in the regulation's final version, the physical address and identification requirements (Sections 200.12 and 200.15) for both sides of a transaction will dilute the inherent privacy of the overall bitcoin network.  Due to potential IP address blocking and other techniques to identify and block New York-based traders, the exchanges operating within the jurisdiction may end up 'ring-fencing' themselves and their customers' bitcoin.  Of course, this was not New York's intention, but if other parties begin to shun 'New York' bitcoins, then those parties that do choose to accept them may only accept them at a discount, making it costly to transfer 'non-private' bitcoins out of New York.  Tainted by government  Typically, we refer to a loss of essential fungibility occurring as a result of some type of positive coin validation required by the government. In this case, it would be the government-approved coins that would be tainted. Perhaps, New York could mandate complete fungibility of their exchanges' coins through legislation, but that would imply subsidizing the exchange rate.  Arthur Hayes, CEO and co-founder of BitMEX (Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange), who has strong derivatives experience with an institutional trading background, explained:  ""These regulations are going to make some savvy traders a lot of money. Because there is a premium placed on privacy, the 'clean' coins trading on exchanges with BitLicenses will trade at a discount to coins trading on exchanges that operate in more laissez-faire jurisdictions. Traders with the ability and risk appetite will be able to arbitrage the price differential.""  Based in Hong Kong, Hayes is launching a bitcoin futures and options exchange similar to the currency futures exchanges that sprouted up in Chicago after the 1971 collapse of Bretton Woods. Hayes recently participated on CoinSummit's derivatives panel in London, where he said he is counting on large speculators and commercial hedgers to utilize exchange-traded futures and options as a risk management tool for bitcoin.  Jurisdictional differential  Just as WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil contracts vs North Sea Brent crude oil contracts trade at a differential and Chicago wheat contracts vs Kansas City wheat contracts trade at a differential, certain jurisdictional bitcoins can trade with a differential. For now, only a single-type bitcoin futures contract will be traded on BitMEX.  Indeed, newly mined 'virgin' bitcoin have commanded a premium for some time now in certain circles. In 2013-14, Mt. Gox coins frequently traded at either a premium or discount to other bitcoin depending on politics and exchange liquidity.  With physical bitcoin over the counter or with person-to-person trading, Hayes describes a likely scenario:  ""The best example would be citizens of New York who wish to anonymously buy Bitcoin. Buyers will need to pay an increased fee to a trader who does not possess a BitLicense. The fee will cover his or her costs of acquiring coins outside of New York, and extra profit for the trader compensating him or her for the extra risks taken.""  Bitcoin black market  Free markets solve political and structural problems to increase liquidity, and currencies are no different.  Today, one of the best examples of this is the 'blue dollar' exchange rate in peso-ravaged Argentina, which trades at a 60% premium to the official US dollar exchange rate with the central bank.  The BitLicense-based exchange rate may be the closest thing to an official central bank rate for bitcoin and maybe this is a conscious attempt to develop an institutional wholesale market. Ultimately, it could be a bonanza for those that find themselves with the unofficial bitcoin, just like the happy tourists to Argentina.  It's quite possible that, at the end of the day, we will see a three-tier rate structure for bitcoin:  Virgin bitcoin  Free market bitcoin  Tainted jurisdiction official bitcoin  Hayes added, ""At the end of the day these regulations will do nothing but push more trading off exchange and make it more expensive for honest people to obtain financial privacy.""

42377486,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UbD,1406719180,CoinSafe Releases ‘Virtual Bitcoin ATM’ Apps for Merchants,"Seattle-based company CoinSafe says its new mobile and desktop apps can turn any local business into a 'bitcoin ATM', or face-to-face bitcoin exchange.  The CoinSafe apps are free to use and allow businesses to trade bitcoins directly with walk-in customers.  After registering their business name for inclusion in CoinSafe's directory, owners then link the app to a Blockchain, Coinbase or Bitstamp account and start trading bitcoins face-to-face.  CoinSafe says the software is ""designed to be used by someone who has no idea what bitcoin is"", and that a staff member merely needs to confirm that funds have been received before releasing the payout amount in either bitcoin or cash.  The apps are HTML5-based, so are able to run on any device or platform a business might have on hand. CoinSafe says, when designing the apps, it focused on simplicity for the uninitiated user, and that it does not charge any fees to use its service.  See the company's explanatory video:  CoinSafe co-founder and CEO Michael Flaxman said the software provided business owners with a less risky, more flexible option for getting bitcoin into their customers' hands without having to purchase or maintain ATM hardware.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We just launched, but the interest has been overwhelming. I think merchants really like the idea of having a bitcoin ATM, but when you're running a business it's hard to justify a $10,000 investment in a machine whose future seems so uncertain. Bitcoin ATMs and vending machines make a lot of sense once you're doing hundreds of transactions per day, but unfortunately most stores aren't seeing enough volume yet to recoup their investment.""  He further said that CoinSafe would provide a map on its website showing the locations of businesses who had signed up to the service.  Security and fees  The company will not have access to any user's private keys and will encrypt all customer information in transit to its services, its website says. It also recommends that businesses keep larger amounts of bitcoin in cold storage.  Businesses paying out cash for bitcoins only do not have to give API access to CoinSafe at all, so long as they provide a bitcoin address by which the transaction can be confirmed. The service uses standard transaction fees of approximately 0.0001 BTC (about 6 US cents).  Everything is handled automatically: CoinSafe takes care of fees when the customer is buying bitcoin with cash, while wallet software takes care of fees when users sell bitcoins for cash.  Since merchants are allowed to set a markup on the average market price, CoinSafe transparently displays the markup to customers so they can see whether they are getting a good deal or not.  Rival services  CoinSafe's offering is similar to BTC China's 'Picasso' mobile app, also marketed internationally as an 'anywhere ATM' solution to allow both businesses and individuals to set percentage price commissions and trade bitcoins face-to-face.  In both cases, the apps replicate bitcoin ATMs' basic functions as a way to trade without using a full exchange, and a business does not necessarily have to accept bitcoin for its goods or services to function as an ATM/exchange.  Online marketplaces, such as such as LocalBitcoins and Mycelium's Local Trader, also offer a way to connect with others to buy and sell bitcoin.  The apps, however, give customers an alternative to the rigmarole and potential risks of setting up accounts and dealing with individuals on Internet-based cryptocurrency markets.  The regulation issue  One potential problem for businesses using the apps is that exchanges that trade fiat currencies for digital ones online are, in some countries, subject to strict know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations forcing them to collect identifying and personal material from every customer.  In several jurisdictions, they are also considered money transmitters and must apply for the requisite licence.  Hence, it is unlikely a local business would have the resources or procedures to undergo financial world-level compliance procedures.  Flaxman discussed the possible effects New York's 'BitLicenses' plan would have on the bitcoin ecosystem, saying:  ""It's hard to say what effect the proposed regulations will have. While the US hasn't been that friendly towards bitcoin businesses in the past, we're hopeful that the government won't get this too wrong for too long. I think most people want the jobs and innovation to stay here and not get shipped overseas.""  Face-to-face traders using services like LocalBitcoins and Mycelium's Local Trader exist in a similar grey area. Two Florida men were charged in February with violation of anti-money laundering and money transmission laws, after using LocalBitcoins. One of them, Michell Abner Espinoza, had traded only 150 BTC in six months.  LocalBitcoins itself is not involved with this or any other similar case.  On its FAQ page, CoinSafe says regulatory issues are still unclear and vary from place to place, and requests that users relay their experiences back to its team.

42377488,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UWB,1406684963,New Zealand Bitcoin ATM Operator Shuts Down After Bank Refusals,"New Zealand-based bitcoin ATM operator Bitcoin Central says it has been forced to shut its doors, the result of local banks' refusal to provide financial services.  While bitcoin businesses around the world are going to great lengths to comply with new or potential digital currency regulation, they are also discovering another layer of difficulty: getting banks to supply the account services vital to the existence of any mainstream business.  The heading on Bitcoin Central's homepage now reads: ""We are now closed. Please read below for the why.""  ""It's the banks. Unfortunately, despite complying with all the legal requirements we have been unable to secure banking facilities. Without these the Bitcoin ATM business cannot operate long term. The negativity from the banking sector to Bitcoin also threatens the ATM owner's other businesses. For me it is prudent to shut the ATM down. If you have any interest in purchasing a second-hand bitcoin ATM with compliance documents. Please get in touch.""  Bitcoin Central had only launched its Robocoin machine at Auckland's Ironbar Cafe on 3rd June, calling it ""NZ's first true Bitcoin ATM"" thanks to the machine's two-way exchange facility. At the time, the company claimed ""it does everything we need to make sure that we comply with NZ laws on its use"".  The Robocoin machine had all its know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) functions enabled. Although all Robocoin products have the ability to scan palms and check ID documents, they are not required to be functional in some jurisdictions.  Other NZ companies feel the pain  CoinDesk spoke to Jonathan Ewing, Director of NZ digital currency multi-service business Bitto, which operates a pair of Lamassu vending machines it launched in April. Bitto moves the machines around to various conferences, events, corporate gatherings and social environments.  Bitto has had its own struggles with bank account closures. Ewing said:  ""Only last week, two months after account closure, I received a personal apology from the CEO of Co-Operative Bank NZ on business disruption and their need to comply with 'procedures' otherwise their banking license would be in jeopardy. We have taken oral expert advice from [law firm] Buddle Findlay indicating our requirements around AML & KYC, and this has led to the unintended outcome by the bank, specific to global AML legislation.""  Ewing said as a result of this, Bitto is refocusing its efforts away from the vending machines and onto bitcoin applications, Ethereum-based smart contracts, Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DOAs) and mining upgrades.  It's not all bad news, though, he added, there is still a large degree of professional interest across related industries.  ""On the flip side we have had approaches from finance experts, brokers and lawyers seeking professional advice on how to technically up-skill and acquire bitcoin knowledge. We are empowered by our colleagues' enthusiasm for significant system wide change and open, transparent decentralisation.""  His company remained ""invigorated and empowered"" to explore how bitcoin could improve even more services, like employee pay, local tax, suppliers' invoices and debit cards. Bitto remained ready to look offshore for financial services if necessary.  Banks, not governments, stifling bitcoin innovation  ""No doubt about it, the banksters are threatened and making business life difficult for young and innovative companies, to the detriment of advancing entirely new financial systems and rampant opportunity,"" Ewing said.  An unnamed banker in neighboring Australia recently revealed details on why banks often refuse bitcoin-related businesses, even those that merely accept or use bitcoin for services unrelated to finance.  The banker blamed international counter-terrorism-financing (CTF) agreements as the primary reason for banks' reluctance, especially those with partnerships or subsidiaries operating in the US. Not only must banks perform expensive due diligence on every business customer, bitcoin's lack of legal status as money means government regulators are unable to assist in investigations.  Many banks prefer simply to throw up their hands and walk away from digital currencies altogether, with some said to have written policies that specify such action.  CoinDesk contacted Bitcoin Central for comment, but had not received a response at press time.
