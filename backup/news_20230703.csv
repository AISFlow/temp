14478522,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540925,1688425243,"Ethereum Eyes $2,000 As Crypto Market Shakes Off SEC Woes","Last week, the likes of Ethereum in the crypto market were shaken when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC0 revealed that it found the Bitcoin Spot ETF filings of giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity, among others, inadequate. This news saw the price of cryptocurrencies declines rapidly. But as the new week opens, investors have shaken off the effect of the announcement and bulls have begun to take over. Ethereum Sets Sight On $2,000 Level Ethereum’s recovery following the SEC announcement has been encouraging for investors, leading to a return of positive sentiment around the digital asset. Following this, ETH is now looking toward the $2,000 level despite the bears currently mounting significant resistance at this point. Related Reading: Litecoin Bull Case Grows Stronger As Hashrate Touches New All Time-High The digital asset has already reclaimed the $1,950 resistance which is now serving as support. As a result, this could provide the much-needed bounce-off point as the cryptocurrency attempts another rally. Such a rally from here could easily see ETH re-take $2,000 once more. Fortunately, Ethereum continues to trade well above its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which have helped the digital asset to solidify its bull momentum for the short term. As long as buyers continue to dominate the market, the break above $2,000 is programmed and will likely be achieved before the week runs out. ETH sitting close to $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Factors That Could Propel ETH Forward One thing that could serve as a catalyst for a rally toward $2,500 for Ethereum would be approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Spot ETF filings that have been made by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity have already propelled the market forward. But this is only a fraction of what is possible if one or more of the ETFs are approved. Such approval will likely see billions of dollars from institutional investors flow into the market as they rush to take advantage and gain exposure to assets such as Bitcoin. And as seen before, it would not be long until an Ethereum Spot ETF follows. Related Reading: Here’s What Caused Bitcoin’s Flash Crash To $29,000 If this happens, then it could not only trigger a rally toward $2,500 for Ethereum. But it could be just the catalyst that the market needs to enter another bull season. Furthermore, an approval coinciding with the Bitcoin halving next year would see prices rise rapidly. For now, ETH is still maintaining its position, trading at a price of $1,967. This accounts for a 2.68% increase in the last day and a 3.88% increase in the last week.

According to a press release, the collection features a series of digital portraits of the members of the Swiss Women’s National Team. All of the proceeds from the collection will be donated to the team, as well as other organizations dedicated to empowering female football players.  The 756 NFTs, minted on Ethereum, will be available for purchase starting July 11 on CSX, Credit Suisse’s digital banking application.  Additionally, the NFTs will be for sale across three packages, ranging from 150 to 10,000 Swiss francs – about $167 to $11,000. The packages come with corresponding benefits including a physical artwork counterpart, a meet and greet with the players and a signed jersey.  Sandra Caviezel, head of partnerships and sponsorship at Credit Suisse, said in a press release she’s looking forward to using NFTs as a funding mechanism to help fuel the growth of women’s football across Switzerland.  “These funds will on the one hand provide direct support to the women's national team and on the other hand will be used for girls' football projects and are thus earmarked for the promotion of young talent,"" says Caviezel.

14476940,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540939,1688421615,Crypto Market Cap Poised For Breakout: Analyst Predict 23% Upside Potential,"The crypto market has been on a rollercoaster this year, with prices fluctuating wildly and regulatory pressures causing significant drops. However, recent developments have given investors renewed confidence in the market, leading to a total crypto market cap recovery. On June 15th, the total crypto market cap hit a low point of $972 billion, following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulatory pressure on the industry. But since then, the market has rebounded. This recovery has been driven partly by the entrance of major financial players into the crypto space. Several applications for a Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by major financial players such as Blackrock and Fidelity have been filed, indicating that they are interested in betting on cryptocurrencies. This has helped to rebuild investor confidence in the market, leading to increased investments and a rise in the total crypto market cap. Crypto Market Cap’s Moment Of Truth Cryptocurrency investors are closely monitoring the total crypto market cap as it attempts to break through a significant resistance level. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, if the market can successfully breach this level, it could pave the way for continued upward momentum and potentially significant gains for the overall market. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is around $1.17 trillion, with Bitcoin making up the lion’s share of this value. However, the market has been trading in a relatively tight range over the past few weeks, with many investors looking for a catalyst to drive prices higher. Rekt Capital believes that a breakout above the current resistance level could be just the catalyst that the market needs to see a sustained uptrend. Rekt Capital suggests that the market could see gains of between 10% and 23% over time if this breakout occurs. As depicted in the chart, the immediate resistance levels for the global market cap of the cryptocurrency industry are currently at $1.18 and $1.25. The latter represents the highest level achieved in 2023. Related Reading: Historical Litecoin Bearish Signal Goes Off, Correction Incoming? However, certain conditions must be met for the market to break through these levels. Firstly, there needs to be an improvement in current market conditions, including a relaxation of crypto regulations by regulators globally, particularly in the US. Additionally, there needs to be a resolution of the ongoing Bitcoin Spot ETF applications by major financial players with the SEC. If these conditions are met, it could lead to an influx of financial players and investors into cryptocurrency. Many investors are looking to cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation, and greater regulatory clarity and the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could make the industry more attractive to traditional investors. Cryptocurrency Trading Volume Drops To 2020 Levels Crypto trading volumes have reached their lowest levels since 2020, despite the ongoing rally in June. According to a report by crypto market data provider Kaiko, spot trade volumes have significantly declined in Q2, with Binance registering the strongest drop in trading activity. Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, saw volumes fall by nearly 70% after the exchange reintroduced fees for its most liquid Bitcoin pairs. This move, aimed at reducing market manipulation, appears to have significantly impacted trading activity on the platform. However, Binance was not the only exchange to see a significant decline in trading volumes. Other popular exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, and Huobi, also saw volumes decline by over 50% in Q2. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Dominate, But Expert Warns Of Potential $20,000 Retest The decline in trading volumes is surprising, given the recent rally in the crypto market. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been bullish in June, reaching a high of over $31,000. Despite this, trading volumes have remained subdued, suggesting that investors are not as active in the market as they have been.

Its price recently surged over 200% this month after being listed on EDX Markets, a new exchange backed by major institutions. Trading also spiked on Upbit, a major Korean exchange. This led to a significant increase in the total hash rate and mining difficulty as miners migrated to the blockchain to chase profits. Bitcoin Cash Hash Rate Reaches Highest In Two Years According to data from CoinWarz, the BCH hash rate jumped to over 5.45 EH/s in the closing hours of June, reaching its highest point in over two years. The increased hash power means the BCH network has become increasingly secure as miners move to the blockchain. Mining difficulty also followed suit, jumping to 494.8 G in less than a day. Related Reading: Historical Litecoin Bearish Signal Goes Off, Correction Incoming? While frequent difficulty adjustments can impact mining profits in the short run, the heightened interest in mining Bitcoin Cash is a good sign for the network. BCH mining difficulty touches two-year highs | Source: CoinWarz The rally in Bitcoin Cash’s price and mining metrics has put pressure on those short-selling BCH futures contracts. The total amount of money lost on BCH-tracked futures shorts and longs combined was over $25 million, which is the largest in over two years. All of this comes ahead of the Bitcoin Cash Halving, an event that is expected to happen in May 2024, cutting block rewards in half. The rapid rise in mining difficulty and hash rate could be linked to this. However, given that it is almost a year away, it is more likely that the altcoin’s recovery and price movements over the last week are the culprit. BCH Price Action The future price outlook for Bitcoin Cash remains highly uncertain, given that the current rally came as a surprise to many investors. The next several weeks will be extremely important in determining whether or not this rally has sufficient energy to drive Bitcoin Cash to new highs in 2023 or whether or not it fizzles out. BCH holds steady at $288 | Source: BCHUSDT on TradingView.com Currently, BCH seems overbought from various indicators like the Relative Strength Index.

42410230,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcnITz,1688416281,Three Arrows Founders to Donate Future Earnings to Creditors in Spirit of 'Karma',"Two founders of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) will donate ""future earnings"" to creditors who lost money after its implosion last year, one of them, Kyle Davies, said Monday in a Twitter Spaces hosted by Mario Nafwal.  Davies described the plan as a ""shadow recovery process,"" outside the ongoing liquidation proceedings that are trying to recover value from the bankrupt company and distribute it to creditors. In fact, some early creditors have already been made whole, he said.  The failed hedge fund manager said he and his co-founders believed in ""karma"" and that any of these extra donations would supplement any recoveries through the formal process.  The comments might be taken with a grain of salt by a crypto community and creditors who are still nursing losses from the epic collapse.  ""The founders of Three Arrows have willfully ignored multiple requests to assist with this process after initiating the liquidation themselves, and the court records paint a clear picture of the ways in which they have hindered creditor recoveries,"" a spokesperson for Teneo, the 3AC liquidator, said in an email to CoinDesk, when asked for a response to Davies' comments. ""Instead of promising creditors future earnings from a nascent venture, we would recommend that the founders engage in the court-ordered activities already underway.""  The spokesperson alleged.  ""We have this process by which we will donate over time,"" Davies said. ""We very much believe in the idea that if we do good and we say, you know, creditors who lost money, they have a way to make more back.""  Davies made the comments after being asked about the optics of him and Su Zhu, the other co-founder, working on a new crypto exchange from the beaches of Bali, while their previous company was undergoing a liquidation process. He said that there is a ""connection"" between their new venture and creditors, who will in fact benefit from their new enterpreneurial journey.  The two have launched a trading platform called Open Exchange (OPNX) to trade bankruptcy claims. The exchange claims that there are 20 million users with $20 billion in claims, after major players like Celsius Network and FTX have filed for Chapter 11 protections in the past year's market rout. The exchange, called Open Exchange (OPNX), was announced in February, less than a year after the hedge fund imploded along with $2.5 billion in customer deposits.  Read more: A Three Arrows Capital Founder Talks About His New Crypto Bankruptcy Exchange  ""One of the things we really believe in is karma,"" and that there is ""something greater than all of us,"" Davies said in the Twitter Spaces.  Asked about OPNX's progress in the Twitter Spaces, Davies said that ""it's a journey"" and that they are seeing about $50 million in daily trading volume at the moment.  The shadow recovery process described by Davies doesn't involve a tokenized asset, he said. The founder did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment to clarify the mechanism at the time of publication.  Currently, only claims from lender Celsius are tradeable on the platform, but claims in the bankruptcies of FTX, Genesis, BlockFi, Voyager, Hodlnaut, Mt.

The refiling follows feedback reportedly given to applicants for spot bitcoin ETFs by U.S. securities regulators that filings were ""inadequate"" without the name of the partner in the surveillance-sharing agreements, which are supposed to help guard against market manipulation.  Several other pending applications, including one on behalf of BlackRock's money-management rival, Fidelity, have since been updated to name Coinbase as the partner for the surveillance-sharing agreements.

The original June 15 filing for a BlackRock ETF called for a surveillance-sharing agreement but didn’t name which exchange would serve as the partner in the deal.  On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed sources, that Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) officials had told representatives of Nasdaq and Cboe that their bitcoin ETF listing applications were “inadequate” because they omitted the name of the surveillance-sharing partner.

14472142,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540910,1688410816,Crypto Analyst Sheds Light On Litecoin Next Possible Price Move,"In a market of ever-changing dynamics, Litecoin (LTC), one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, is caught in an interesting situation. The digital asset’s price direction has recently been the subject of analysis by a renowned crypto expert, Ali, who is well-known for his crypto predictions and insights. His analysis, drawn from a key market indicator, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, may shed light on Litecoin’s immediate future. Ali’s forecast derives from the 30-day MVRV for Litecoin, which presently stands at around 35%. This metric serves as an instrument for tracking the disparity between the market value and realized the value of the digital asset. Related Reading: Litecoin Up 18% In Past 24 Hours, Is Halving Rally Here? Ali’s recent observation adds a significant dimension to the market’s perception of Litecoin, suggesting that history might be gearing up to repeat itself. The History Of Litecoin MVRV And Price Corrections As Ali highlighted in a recent tweet, Litecoin’s history since 2018 shows a distinctive pattern. Whenever the 30-day MVRV exceeds the 30% threshold, a sharp price correction ensues. Such corrections have typically led to a decline in LTC’s price ranging from 30% to 40%. This pattern has persisted over the years and lends credence to Ali’s prediction about a possible downturn. Currently, #Litecoin MVRV 30D hovers around 35%. Historically, each time $LTC MVRV 30D exceeds the 30% mark since 2018, a sharp price correction typically follows! This usually translates to a #LTC price drop ranging from 30% to 40%. pic.twitter.com/R5oMMaKWGc — Ali (@ali_charts) July 2, 2023 The rationale behind this is straightforward. When the MVRV ratio is high, it indicates that holders have accrued significant profits and may decide to sell, resulting in a price drop. However, it’s important to remember that while historical trends provide an indication, they are not a guaranteed predictor of future events. LTC Latest Price Action On June 30, Litecoin experienced a significant price hike, recording a sizeable green candlestick. This surge propelled LTC to the high of $109 at the time of writing, reflecting a nearly 24% increase over the last seven days. In addition, Litecoin has exhibited a minor decrease of 1.8% within the last 24 hours. The asset’s market capitalization has also seen a 22.5% surge in the past week, moving from a low of $6.4 billion last Monday to as high as $8 billion as of today. This has ranked the altcoin as 8th among the largest crypto by market capitalization. Litecoin’s daily trading volume has also recorded a significant surge from the $462 million volume seen late last month to stand above $1 billion in the past 24 hours. LTC currently has a 24-hour low of $108 and a 24-hour high of $114. Related Reading: Litecoin Surging Adds 20% Ahead of Halving Event, DigiToads Gains 370% In Presale It is worth noting that LTC’s recent surge can be attributed to the upcoming halving which is to take place in the next few weeks. This has served as a catalyst for investors to accumulate the altcoin. However, despite the LTC surge, the asset is still 72% down from its peak of $412.

42410229,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcnIXI,1688408535,How Central Bankers Are Reshaping the Definition of Money,"Those of us who have been following the evolution of bitcoin for some time now will have lost count of the number of times we’ve been told “but it’s not money!” Critics trot out the textbook definition of the word – a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value – and insist that bitcoin can never meet all three, while assuming that the established criteria are necessary conditions just because we have been told they are.  One of the many valuable gifts that the emergence of bitcoin bestowed on the world is the imperative to question money’s definition and utility. Most people assume they know what it is, but that is always clouded by their experience. I used to work in traditional finance and so I thought I knew what money was – only, it turns out that I conflated it with numbers. Others conflate it with exchange, some treat it as a collectible, yet all understand that it is useful, which is why people want it.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  A 2015 explainer from the European Central Bank (ECB) – not exactly known for its open-armed embrace of innovation – opens with this illuminating sentence:  “The nature of money has evolved over time.”  And yet on June 23, ECB board member Fabio Panetta delivered a speech at the BIS Annual Conference in which he insisted that “cryptos have failed to make good on their claim to perform the role of money.”  Here’s another quote:  “Cryptos have not developed into a form of finance that is innovative and robust, but have instead morphed into one that is deleterious.”  Apart from the basic mistake of assuming all cryptos have the same goal, the speech highlights Panetta’s grade-school level of understanding of how crypto assets work (no disrespect meant to grade schoolers). And of traditional markets, come to that: every criticism he lobbied at crypto assets could equally be applied to currency and securities markets – even more so, since they have a much longer track record. But his point is that the crypto industry “has so far produced no societal benefits” and therefore is not deserving of public support.  The confusion itself is fine; most people still don’t understand crypto assets. What I find depressing is the official approval to trot out a speech like this at a high-level event, in which a senior official at a key institution on the macroeconomic stage – one concerned about maintaining its relevance – insists that European needs are global needs and the European take on money is the global take on money. What’s more, this comes from a representative of the same institution that recognizes money evolves.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Crypto and AI: Save Us From the Hype  Panetta appears to believe that free market crypto assets should be regulated into irrelevance, while a digital ledger central bank currency is developed. This starts to get at the real story here.  It turns out that Panetta is not necessarily against the evolution of the definition of money – the intensifying discussions around CBDCs shows that this evolution is inevitable (more on this below).  What Panetta is against is free market evolution. Anything to do with money, even its definition, should be centrally controlled. His comments imply that this is better for the public – if they speculate on free market innovation, they will get hurt. Centrally controlled official innovation will make sure that doesn’t happen.  From a different angle  The rest of the BIS conference continued in a similar vein. Last weekend, the organization – essentially the central bank of central banks – unveiled its annual report.  The 142-page document dedicates one of the three sections to “the future monetary system.” It fleshes out the idea of a “unified ledger” to connect the various CBDC and tokenized security networks currently under development, and it extols the benefits of asset tokenization, specifically the ability to efficiently reconcile ownership and settlement and improve asset distribution transparency.  Read more: George Kaloudis - Step Aside ‘Blockchain Technology’, IMF and BIS Have a New Crypto Buzzword  But, cough, as for crypto assets:  “Crypto and decentralised finance (DeFi) have offered a glimpse of tokenisation’s promise, but crypto is a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money. Not only is crypto self-referential, with little contact with the real world, it also lacks the anchor of the trust in money provided by the central bank.”  The report echoes Panetta’s conviction that all crypto assets are the “same” and that all experiments to date have been a failure. Official institutions are much better, it insists, at knowing what is good for the people.  The overall message is: we recognize that money is changing, and we are going to be the ones to decide exactly how. The logic seems to be that change in something as essential as money should not be organic – it needs to be controlled.  Now for the important questions  Keep digging and you eventually come across a glimpse of how even official thinking about money is changing.  Earlier this month, two economists from the German central bank published a paper for the European Money and Finance Forum called “Empowering central bank money for a digital future.” This is not a paper from the Bundesbank itself. Rather it is the personal opinions of the authors, one of whom is Martin Diehl, Head of Section Payment Systems Analysis and a Bundesbanker for the past 22 years.  The note discusses the design of central bank digital currencies, and recognizes that a guiding principle should be “form follows function.” Ah ha! This unearths the insight that the function of money is not universal or even constant, and that its design should take its function into account.  But what is its function? Going back to the textbook definition referenced above, for some it’s a payment mechanism, for some a store of value and for some a unit of account. Traditional economists insist that it has to be all three, but this assumption is breaking down in the face of the need to decide what central bank digital currencies should look like.  As the authors say elsewhere in the report:  “What has never changed is that money is what money does.”  While struggling to let go of the traditional definition, the authors accept that the technological advances – driven largely by the emergence of blockchains – allow for some separation of money’s features. What money can do has been impacted by technology, in ways we are all still coming to terms with. It has always been able to trigger programmatic functions (such as in vending machines and arcade games), only now they are sophisticated. It has always had the potential to also be a collectible (signed bills, historic notes), only now with much greater flexibility. Now, money can embed both clearing and settlement. Now, money can be programmed.  This brings us back to the debate around what a CBDC should do. Should it be programmable? The temptation to limit and/or channel payments according to the activity will be hard to resist. And is programmable money fungible? Most assume money should be (it is now). Should it replace current wholesale payment systems, or merely connect to them? Full replacement allows for real-time tracking of financial flows, but is riskier and much more operationally complex.  These questions and others highlight that the very essence of money is being re-considered, even if financial practitioners don’t know that’s what they’re doing. Meanwhile, crypto builders continue to push boundaries, explore use cases and wait for legacy finance to catch up with the idea that old semantics may be convenient.

Bored Ape Yacht Club has experienced a decline in the average price of its NFTs, according to OpenSea, reflecting a broader cooldown in the NFT market and an extended crypto winter that has impacted the price of Ethereum, which powers many NFT collections. Other top NFT collections, including MoonBirds, Azuki and Doodles have also experienced dips in recent months.  According to data analytics platform CoinGecko, BAYC’s floor price dropped to a low of 27.4 ETH, or about $53,000 on Sunday evening before rebounding slightly. The last time BAYC’s floor price dropped below 30 ETH was in October 2021, shortly before its floor price skyrocketed to new highs during the NFT boom. According to CoinGecko, BAYC once reached a floor price of 153.7 ETH, or about $430,000, in April 2022.  The collection’s floor price has halved since April of this year – it was trading at 64 ETH, or $126,000, at the start of the month. At the time of writing, the floor price of the collection has rebounded slightly to 29.5 ETH, or about $57,800, according to OpenSea.  Floor price is a metric that’s often used to get a sense of how popular an NFT project is at a given point in time. It measures the lowest price a seller wants for an NFT in a collection and can vary slightly across platforms.  According to OpenSea, BAYC's trading volume has decreased 38% over the last 24 hours. BAYC currently has a trading volume 1.2 million ETH, or $2.4 billion – making it the largest NFT collection by sales volume, according to data from CryptoSlam.  BAYC’s floor price began to tumble in April, plummeting to a five-month low of 55.6 ETH, or about $110,000. At the time, pseudonymous NFT collector Franklin sold 27 of his Apes, contributing to negative sentiment.  Last month, the collection’s floor price slid further as NFT trader Jeffrey Huang, known as Machi Big Brother, sold 50 Apes in one weekend, including one lot of 19 Apes sold on marketplace Blur for 651 ETH, or nearly $1.2 million.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/03/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-collection-floor-price-sinks-to-20-month-low,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dabdd562da052e5789b863b4de954c310673cd41-879x665.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The funds have significantly decreased from 2.37 billion LUNC to a mere 416 million LUNC. Consequently, the community is now facing a shortage of funds, hindering their ability to finance further development and maintenance of the chain. Terra Luna Community Proposals And Allocations The Terra Luna Classic community passed three proposals that were responsible for depleting its reserves — from a Quant team for USTC re-peg, Joint L1 Task Force Q3 proposal, and continuing operating Terra Rebels infrastructure and apps. Related Reading: Terra LUNA Classic: Thriving Or Struggling After Ecosystem Collapse? Core developer Joint L1 Task Force Q3 received 1.264 billion LUNC, Quant USTC Repeg Team gets 222.222 million LUNC, and Terra Rebels received 484.367 million LUNC. Now, the community pool balance has only 416.33 million LUNC and 4.49 million USTC. Joint L1 Task Force Q3 proposes to work on reducing LUNC and USTC circulating supply in Q3, upgrading to stable Columbus and Cosmos SDK versions, and other major developments. The L1TF and Professor Edward Kim will assist the Quant team in the USTC re-peg. Meanwhile, the Quant team worked on modeling and simulation for the USTC incremental re-peg buybacks and staking swaps, evaluating and assessing the Market Module and working on other tools. Terra Rebels needs funds to continue operating and maintaining Rebel Station and other apps, as well as testnet and Terra Classic infrastructure. Related Reading: Terra Classic Continues To Brush Off Market Downtrends, Buy Now? In light of recent developments, several prominent figures within the community have expressed concerns regarding the approval of seemingly unnecessary community spending proposals. They believe that a more discerning approach should be taken, with only crucial proposals proceeding for voting after thorough and thoughtful discussions. This sentiment reflects the community’s desire to prioritize and allocate resources effectively, ensuring that decisions are made in the best interest of the community as a whole. LUNC Price Fluctuations And Trading Activity Following the announcement of Binance’s 2.65 billion LUNC burn on Saturday, the price of Terra Luna Classic experienced a notable surge of over 3%. However, this increase was short-lived as the price failed to sustain the gains and subsequently retreated to the support level.

During this period, the recorded low and high values were $0.0000850 and $0.0000877, respectively. It is worth noting that although the price has remained relatively stable, there has been a slight increase in trading volume over the past 24 hours.

This accounts for its presale success and the increased adoption it has been gaining. Due to these, analysts predict a bright future for the project, which has shown strong potential to keep soaring in the crypto winter. On the other hand, Monolith (TKN) is struggling to beat bearish sentiments as the bears continue to dominate over the token. This article looks at Monolith’s (TKN) predictions, what Uwerx is all about, and why you should quickly become a WERX holder. >>BUY WERX TOKENS NOW What The Charts Say About Monolith (TKN) The crypto market considers Monolith (TKN) a near-dead crypto as it has only recorded a few transactions or trading activities for a long time. This has caused Monolith (TKN) to see a huge plunge without signs of recovery. Monolith (TKN) currently dines with the bear as it has remained at the bottom, with predictions showing it might record only a negligible price increase. Monolith (TKN) has declined by almost 5% in the past week, and further decline is imminent. Monolith (TKN) is seeing increased selling pressure as most token holders quickly sell their tokens and move to more active platforms. Monolith (TKN) Launched Its Visa Debit Card Monolith (TKN) is a decentralized banking powered by Ethereum (ETH), enabling users to use its Visa debit card to store or spend their tokens globally. Monolith (TKN) provides a DeFicontract wallet where users can store their tokens and use the Visa debit card to make in-app crypto purchases. >>BUY WERX TOKENS NOW Uwerx (WERX) Continues Smashing Through Its Presale Uwerx's surging presale has been marveling, quickly reaching its final stage, stage 5. This exceeded initial predictions, and due to demands, WERX allocation for the presale was increased to 427,500,000 (57%). Stage 5 has 72,500,000 WERX available, and the total supply of WERX is 750,000,000. The WERX price increase is more surprising. WERX started trading at $0.005 but is now at $0.047725, with more price increases unavoidable. Also, the WERX launch price was increased to $0.095 - $0.115 due to the token’s rising value. There is a 15% purchase bonus to increase users’ profits, and the presale ends on July 31. Uwerx (WERX) Has Leverage Over Other Freelancing Platforms Global gig workers are expected to reach 78 million in 2023. Hence, Uwerx is making significant moves to increase adoption and stand out from centralized platforms. It brings blockchain technology and a 1% service fee, features yet to be seen in freelancing. There is also the UwerxVault which promotes user rewards and engagement. Its platform’s Alpha version launched a few months back and has been gaining traction with more features added. The platform’s features now include the Initial Step of Job Creation, My Activity Page, Initial Step of Finding Talent, Hiring Dashboard Page, Logging In and Sign-Up Pages, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process Page, and Forgot Password. The Job Application Page was remodeled to the Post Job and Apply Page to quicken users' job applications. New features like the Tools and Client and Freelancer Dashboards are in the works. Uwerx will transition to the Beta version, which is now in the works so users can test the platform themselves. InterFi Network and SolidProof have performed audit approvals on Uwerxto ensure its security. The platform has gained over 1,825 Telegram members, 1,652 Twitter followers, and 6,953 sign-ups. The team's agile methodology to release the project in bits and modify the platform based on users' feedback has also contributed to the project’s success. They are eager to hear from the community, and feedback can be emailed to feedback@uwerx.network. To show their dedication to users, the team’s token allocation is now only 7% following their decision to reduce it. For sustainability, they will forfeit ownership of the smart contract once the project becomes listed on centralized exchanges. Also, they began a nine-month liquidity lock on their tokens to prevent rug pulls. This started on June 7, after the 82.8% vote it received from the community to start immediately. A Test Airdrop will be performed to verify wallet addresses for users, for which 98.2% of the community is in support. Uwerx will be a force to reckon with in the freelancing industry. To do that, you have to become a WERX holder. It is best to do so now and maximize the 15% purchase bonus.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, MKR has recorded a significant gain of 30% in this timeframe, sparking much interest and optimism among its numerous traders and holders. For now, it remains unclear what is driving MKR’s price, but there is a clear, strong buying pressure and positive sentiment surrounding the DeFi token in the market. Maker Price Action Surpasses Market In an impressive display of bullish momentum, Maker has witnessed a substantial gain attracting much of the market attention. Initially, MKR began last week trading around $706.85. The token then experienced a slight dip in price over the next few days, trading as low as $670.86 on June 28. Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why Thereafter, Maker started recording gains before a jump in price occurred on June 30, resulting in the token gaining by over 21% to hit a market price of $834.09.

In the early hours of this day, the MKR token boosted by 8% to hit a market price of $929.87 for the first time since March. At the time of writing, MKR is sitting at a current price of $930.78 USD, with a market capitalization value of $897 million. In addition, the token trading volume is set at $76 million, having gone up by 14% in the last day, indicating an increased market activity. Looking at the protocol performance, the MakerDAO has recorded a 1.04% decrease in its TVL over the last day based on data from DeFillama. Nevertheless, the protocol remains the second biggest DeFi project, with a TVL of $6.262 billion. MKR Price Analysis And Prediction MKR has been exhibiting interesting price action recently, with two notable levels to watch. The first one is a resistance zone at the $973 price level, while MKR has faced selling pressure at this level in the past, preventing it from continuing its upward trend. Traders and investors should closely monitor how MKR behaves around this resistance zone, as a breakout above it could potentially signal further upward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Show Strong Buying, Rally To Continue In July? On the other hand, if MKR fails to break above the $973 resistance level, it may face a potential downward retracement to the $662 price level. This price zone has previously acted as a resistance, but if MKR experiences a pullback, it could potentially turn into a support zone.

Shares in crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), which was chosen to be the market for surveillance-sharing agreements in the ETF applications, rose more than 10% to over $80 at around 11:30 ET on Monday.  Cboe has been working with a number of providers to finally get an application for a spot bitcoin ETF approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Fidelity, WisdomTree and ARK Invest. Meanwhile, BlackRock (BLK) is doing the same with Nasdaq.  After having their applications rejected by the SEC for not naming the exchange they were working with on surveillance-sharing agreements, Cboe refiled, naming Coinbase as the firm in question.  COIN's upward trend mirrored that of BTC itself, which was up around 2% on the day above $31,000 around the same time.  Microstrategy (MSTR), the business intelligence firm which holds over $4.6 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC), also saw its shares rally, rising around 10% to $375, their highest level in over a year.

Nevertheless, the persistent nuisance of fake Twitter accounts remains far from abating. Twitter launched Twitter Blue, a subscription service priced at $8 per month. It was launched with the dual purpose of boosting the platform’s revenue and making it financially unfeasible for bots and fake accounts to operate effectively. Despite these efforts, reports indicate that a significant proportion of followers from the most popular crypto accounts are still deceitful. In a recent investigation DappGambl, a crypto platform, conducted an analysis on the same. They suspected that there is a correlation between the popularity of crypto tokens and the presence of fake followers in Twitter accounts. Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why DappGambl examined the social sentiment associated with crypto accounts and it was discovered that as many as 10% of followers from the most followed crypto accounts were fake. Fake Twitter Crypto Followers: Facts And Figures When examining the official accounts of cryptocurrency tokens and ecosystems, it was found that Shiba Inu had the highest proportion of fake followers. These fake followers amounted to 10.26% or approximately 80,000 accounts. Avalanche (AVAX) came in second place with 8.14% fake followers, and Polygon (MATIC) ranked third with 7.58% or around 73,000 fake accounts. In addition, dappGambl’s findings revealed that DAI is widely considered the most beloved and popular coin among Twitter users. On the other hand, XRP is often associated with scams. Other notable figures also face the presence of fake followers on their Twitter accounts. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey reportedly has around 560,000 fake followers, accounting for 8.62% of his total follower count. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin apparently both have nearly 6.5% of their followers identified as fake. Musk’s Anti-Fraud Measures Fail To Tackle Fake Accounts Among prominent figures in the crypto industry, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has around 4.76% fake followers on Twitter. Following closely is Michael Saylor, the co-founder of MicroStrategy, with approximately 6.16% fake followers. Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, the CEO of Binance, also has a significant presence of fake followers, accounting for around 5.58% of his total followers. These statistics underline the prevalence of fake followers among well-known individuals in the crypto space. Despite Elon Musk’s efforts to combat fake accounts, he is followed by over 6.7 million fake accounts, highlighting the persistence of the problem.

In more recent history this has been the case in countries in Latin America for example, where dictators ruled with a fist of iron, safe in the knowledge that the US with its CIA operatives had their back. In Western countries today the same surely cannot be said. Ask 1,000 people on the streets in towns and cities across the US, UK, and European countries for their views on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their implications for zero privacy and total control, and probably nigh on all of them wouldn’t have the foggiest clue what is going on, or that the stakes are as high as they’ve ever been. A dearth of proper debate It might be an extremely unpopular opinion, but much like alcohol was fed to indigenous peoples to keep them quiet while their land and resources were being pillaged, the same could be said of beer and football in today’s society. The problem isn’t just this either. Even if the average Joe or Jane thought there was something amiss and wanted to educate themselves on the situation - where would they go? Television and mainstream media do not contain anything that might be ascribed to be of a serious political nature. With geopolitics and the economic situation in the most desperate state they have been, arguably for decades, no proper mainstream debate is allowed to happen. Still time to get educated So CBDCs are going to land onto the least prepared and educated populace on the matter that it’s possible to get. The powers that be, governments, and banks, with the help of the mainstream media, have successfully kept things under wraps thus far, and it’s only a short matter of time before CBDCs are upon us. There is even the narrative out there that CBDCs will be good for you. They will speed up settlement and enable easy cross-border payments. But as for taking away your freedom to transact with privacy, or the imposition of a social credit system, well they aren’t as important in the eyes of the bankers. All is not lost though. There are still places to find out and educate oneself on the monetary system, CBDCs, and perhaps the solution to it all, in Bitcoin. This kind of information can still be found on the internet, and on social media channels. If CBDCs are allowed to be imposed on citizens then banks will have the power to cut anybody off from their money, much like has already happened recently to Nigel Farage, but this time with just a tap of a central bank keyboard.

Litecoin 30-Day MVRV Ratio Has Registered A Surge Recently As pointed out by an analyst on Twitter, the 30-day MVRV ratio has spiked towards the 35% mark recently. The “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio” here refers to an indicator that measures the ratio between the Litecoin market cap and its realized cap. The “realized cap” here is a capitalization model that aims to find a sort of true value for the asset. According to this model, the true value of any coin in circulation is not the current spot price, but the price at which it was last moved/transferred on the blockchain. As the MVRV compares the market cap (that is, the spot price) with the realized cap (the “real” value of the asset), it can tell us whether the current price is overinflated or not. When the value of the MVRV is greater than 1, it means that the market cap is larger than the realized cap currently. Naturally, such a trend can imply the asset may be overpriced right now. On the other hand, values of the indicator below this threshold suggest the cryptocurrency could be undervalued at the moment as its realized cap is higher than the market cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Show Strong Buying, Rally To Continue In July? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day Litecoin MVRV ratio over the last few years: Looks like the 30-day value of the metric has observed a sharp increase in recent days | Source: Ali on Twitter Here, the MVRV ratio is displayed in terms of the percentage difference between the market cap and the realized cap (meaning that the 0% line plays the role of the 1 mark in this version of the indicator). As shown in the above graph, the 30-day Litecoin MVRV ratio has registered some rapid growth recently. This jump in the indicator has come as the latest rally in the cryptocurrency has occurred, which has now taken the price above the $110 level. The metric has now hit a value of 35%, which implies that the market cap is currently 35% more than the realized cap. Historically, the indicator’s value rising above the 30% level has been a sign that the asset is becoming notably overpriced.

42393214,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgduKn,1688395571,A New Blockchain for Generative AI?,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has quickly become one of the hottest and arguably the most transformational technology trends of the last few decades. The impact of generative AI is evident in all areas of the technology stack, ranging from infrastructure to applications.  Since the release of ChatGPT and the subsequent GPT-4, the Web3 community has been speculating about the potential intersection of generative AI and Web3. While there are many obvious use cases, such as conversational wallets or language exploration, there are more sophisticated theses worth exploring.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock.  What if generative AI deserves its own blockchain?  Open-source momentum versus centralized control  To analyze the viability of a blockchain for generative AI, it is important to understand the current state of affairs regarding foundation models, particularly the emergence of open-source alternatives to API-based tech like GPT-4, and the increasing concerns surrounding centralized control of those foundation models.  Until a few months ago, the gap between API-based and open-source foundation models was significant. Models such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude in the language space, DALL-E, and Midjourney in the computer vision space, seemed significantly advanced compared to open-source alternatives. However, a change started to occur late last year with the surprising open-source release of Stable Diffusion, which provided a viable alternative to API-based text-to-image models. Despite this, large language models (LLMs) continued to be the focal point of generative AI, and in that domain, open-source models paled in comparison to API-based alternatives in terms of quality.  Earlier this year, Meta AI Research published a paper introducing LLaMA, an LLM that matched the performance of GPT-3 while being significantly smaller. Initially, the model was not intended to be open-sourced, but something unexpected happened. A week after its publication, the model was leaked on 4chan and rapidly downloaded by thousands of people. The LLaMA ""accident"" made a foundation LLM available to anyone and sparked an unexpected momentum in open-source innovation.  Shortly after the leak, new open-source foundation models with amusing animal names started to emerge everywhere. Stanford University released Alpaca, Databricks unveiled Dolly, Berkeley University open-sourced Koala, UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University collaborated on the release of Vicuna, Together announced the Red Pajama project, and the list goes on. Stable Diffusion and LLaMA have helped shift the scales of open-source generative AI and have generated significant momentum. Moreover, open-source foundation models are rapidly closing the gap with commercial incumbents in terms of quality.  Another factor contributing to the emergence of a generative AI blockchain is the concern surrounding the lack of transparency and centralized control of foundation models. The size and complexity of the neural architectures powering foundation models make exact interpretability nearly impossible. As a result, the industry must rely on intermediate steps such as more open architectures and thoughtful regulation. That a few centralized entities control the most powerful models in the market adds another layer of concern regarding the feasibility of achieving real accountability, transparency, and interpretability in generative AI.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez - The Next ChatGPT Won’t Be in Web3 Unless Some Things Change  The combination of open-source innovation in foundation models and growing concerns about centralized control in the field creates a unique window of opportunity for Web3 architectures. The abundance of high-quality open-source models reduces the barriers to adoption in Web3 platforms. Solving the transparency and control risks in generative AI is far from trivial, but there is little doubt that blockchain architectures possess key properties that can help in this area.  Building a generative AI foundation in Web3  The explosion of innovation in open-source foundation models has significantly lowered the barrier of entry for Web3 platforms to incorporate generative AI capabilities. The adoption of foundation models in Web3 platforms can follow two fundamental, and likely sequential, paths:  Building DApps that enable intelligent capabilities powered by generative AI.  Constructing new Web3 platforms designed with generative AI as a foundational component.  In the first scenario, we are likely to witness tools like exchanges, explorers, or wallets incorporating conversational capabilities powered by large language models. Additionally, a new generation of DApps will be built with generative models as their cornerstone. In this scenario, Web3 primarily acts as a consumer of generative AI capabilities, with models running on traditional Web2 cloud infrastructures.  More intriguing alternatives emerge when considering Web3 platforms that can inherently support generative AI models. Imagine open-source foundation models like LLaMA, Dolly, or Alpaca running on nodes within a distributed blockchain. The ultimate realization of this vision is a blockchain specifically designed for generative AI.  The concept of a new blockchain optimized for a technology paradigm like generative AI may sound appealing, but it is undeniably controversial. After all, there were no new blockchains created solely for DeFi or NFTs. So, what makes generative AI so different?  The answer lies in the architectural mismatch between the requirements to run foundation models and blockchain runtimes. A typical pre-trained foundation model consists of millions of neurons spread across tens of thousands of interconnected layers, executing on clusters of GPUs or specialized deep learning hardware topologies. No smart contract in the history of Web3 even comes close to that level of complexity. Thus, it is logical to conclude that a new type of architecture is needed. Even Web2 infrastructures are evolving to support large-scale generative AI models, illustrating the magnitude of the required changes in Web3 architectures.  When contemplating a new blockchain for generative AI, the possibilities appear endless. But, the simplest iteration of this idea should encompass a set of core capabilities. The ability to run nodes that execute foundation models is paramount for a blockchain dedicated to generative AI. The same applies to the ability to execute pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference workflows, which are the three primary stages in the life cycle of foundation models. Publishing and sharing datasets used for pretraining or fine-tuning models is also a desired feature. Once we establish a blockchain runtime as the foundational layer, numerous capabilities in the areas of transparency and interpretability can be enabled. For instance, we can envision a proof-of-knowledge protocol that offers transparency regarding the specific weights of a model, validating that non-toxic or biased datasets were used for pretraining.  Why a new blockchain?  The concept of a specialized blockchain for generative AI is enticing, but is it truly necessary? There is a valid value proposition in integrating generative AI capabilities into existing blockchain runtimes. However, the history of software demonstrates a recurring trend of new architecture paradigms influencing infrastructure technologies. Recent trends like cloud computing or big data serve as examples. Foundation models represent fundamentally different architecture paradigms that likely necessitate more specialized blockchain infrastructures to operate effectively.  Furthermore, we cannot overlook the potential for generative AI to transform the lower layers of the blockchain stack. It is not far-fetched to envision a proof-of-stake blockchain where validators process transactions based on natural language. Similarly, smart contracts could utilize language as the fundamental means of exchanging messages.  Generative AI has the potential to drive changes throughout the entire blockchain stack. From this perspective, it seems logical to adopt a first principles approach by enabling a new runtime with the flexibility to incorporate these changes.  The risk of ignoring generative AI in Web3  The idea of a generative AI blockchain can indeed be controversial and not without its challenges. However, I encourage exploring this idea using a via negative argument.  What could happen if we neglect to build new blockchains for generative AI?  Currently, generative AI has created a significant technological gap between Web2 and Web3 architectures. This gap continues to widen in the absence of native generative AI capabilities in Web3. Generative AI is reshaping fundamental aspects of software development, and new frameworks and platforms are rapidly emerging to support this paradigm shift.  Developing native generative AI capabilities is nothing short of an existential challenge for Web3, as it is crucial to enable new waves of innovation in the field.

However, as has been the case in the past, the cryptocurrency has experienced periods of stagnation before making any significant moves. This has resulted in a consolidation phase that has left investors waiting in anticipation for the next direction. And if attempts to breach upper resistance lines fail, it could jeopardize most of the gains made in the last few months of 2023. Will Bitcoin Plummet To The Depths? Crypto analyst under the pseudonym “Captain Faibik” on Twitter, has recently made some bold predictions about Bitcoin’s future. Despite the current bullish sentiment in the market and the possibility of reaching a new yearly high for 2023, Captain Faibik warns that bulls are not “out of the woods yet.” Faibik believes that Bitcoin may retest the $20,000 region in the upcoming months of August and September. However, Faibik also believes that the Bitcoin bull run will officially start in November 2023. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Teases Shibarium Launch, How High Can SHIB Rise? On the other hand, the recent confirmation of a 2-week buy signal, a successful retest from the breakout, and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) crossing above the “0” level for Bitcoin have caught the attention of traders and investors alike. These indicators have only occurred in 2015, 2019, and 2020, leading many to believe that a significant price movement is imminent. Trader “Moustache” highlights that while history doesn’t repeat itself exactly, it often rhymes. This means that while past events can provide insights into potential market movements, there are no guarantees in the volatile cryptocurrency market. However, the fact that these same technical indicators have been observed in the past and have been followed by significant price movements is a cause for excitement among Bitcoin investors. The 2-week buy signal is a particularly significant indicator, suggesting that Bitcoin is oversold and undervalued, making it an attractive investment opportunity. The successful retest from the breakout is also a positive sign as it indicates that the breakout was not a false signal, and the new price level has been validated. The MACD crossing above the “0” level is another bullish indicator as it suggests that the momentum is shifting in favor of the bulls. This is important as it indicates that the buying pressure is increasing, which could lead to a significant price movement shortly. BTC Set To Soar? Economist and trader MikyBull has been closely analyzing the pre-halving price action of Bitcoin for 2024. According to MikyBull, the current accumulation phase is wider than previous halvings, indicating that the post-halving rally may take longer to materialize. However, the wider accumulation phase could also result in a more significant price increase. Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why Furthermore, Bitcoin’s price has already tapped into the bi-yearly resistance, which is a crucial price level that has historically led to breakouts. This indicates that a price breakout is imminent, and MikyBull anticipates a rally before the halving event with a price target between $35,000 and $40,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $30,600, representing a modest gain of 0.4% over the past 24 hours. It is unclear whether the cryptocurrency will continue to hold this level or if a significant pullback will occur. Nonetheless, the current market sentiment favors bullish investors, and Bitcoin appears to be well-positioned for another attempt to break through the $31,000 line. If successful, this could pave the way for the cryptocurrency to achieve further milestones throughout the remainder of 2023.

14464619,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/bitcoin-mining-a-comprehensive-understanding,1688393700,Bitcoin Mining: A Comprehensive Understanding,"Bitcoin mining is an intriguing and complex subject, one that is central to the operations of the burgeoning BTC network. It plays a pivotal role in the generation of new coins as well as it when it comes to the validation of individual transactions. This article provides a detailed overview of the process, the principles on which it operates, different mining methods, its environmental implications, and future prospects. An Insight into the Process Bitcoin mining, as detailed in Satoshi Nakamoto's seminal whitepaper, performs two critical roles within the Bitcoin network. Firstly, as mentioned above, it contributes to the creation of new BTC, and secondly, it enables the verification and addition of transactions to the blockchain, i.e. a decentralized digital ledger that records all transactions taking place within the Bitcoin network. Miners use powerful computing systems to solve complex mathematical problems in a competitive bid to produce a valid block containing a group of confirmed transactions. Once a miner successfully solves a problem, they add the new block to the blockchain and, as a reward, receive newly minted BTC and a portion of the transaction fees. The Bitcoin mining process effectively protects the network from potential fraud or malicious activities by making alterations to transaction history or Bitcoin forgery nearly impossible. The Fundamentals of Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin mining operates on the basis of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Here, miners, with the help of powerful computing systems, carry out intricate calculations to produce a hash. The goal is to generate a hash that meets or falls below a specific target set by the network. Over the years, the hardware used for Bitcoin mining has evolved significantly. Initially, miners used standard consumer-grade computers, but today, they leverage Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These specialized devices provide far superior performance and efficiency compared to their predecessors. Another crucial aspect of Bitcoin mining is the ""halving"" process. Approximately every four years, the reward for mining a new block is reduced by 50%, which inherently decreases the inflation rate of Bitcoin. This process contributes to Bitcoin's scarcity and, subsequently, its value. The Different Facets of Bitcoin Mining As Bitcoin mining continues to evolve, different mining methods have emerged. As pointed out by MaskEX Academy, a one-stop platform for all things crypto devised by cryptocurrency exchange MaskEX, these methods cater to the various needs and preferences of miners — such as solo mining, mining pools, and mining farms. To elaborate, solo mining offers miners the advantage of retaining the entire mining reward and transaction fees, but it often requires high computational power. Conversely, mining pools represent a group of miners who come together and bring their resources together. They then share the rewards proportionally based on the computational power contributed by each. Lastly, mining farms are large-scale operations that involve massive capital investment and continuous maintenance. Environmental Considerations Bitcoin mining's high energy consumption has garnered much debate regarding its environmental sustainability. The massive computational power required for the PoW mechanism often results in high energy usage, contributing to increased carbon emissions. However, sustainable solutions are being explored to mitigate these impacts. For instance, some mining operations are leveraging renewable energy sources, while others use carbon credits to offset emissions. Some innovative approaches even repurpose the waste heat generated by the mining process. The Profitability Equation The profitability of Bitcoin mining is dependent on a variety of factors. These include the efficiency of mining hardware, the cost of electricity, and the current Bitcoin market value. As an article by MaskEX Academy notes, the efficiency of mining hardware is a critical factor, as older, less efficient hardware may not justify its operational costs. Furthermore, electricity prices, being a primary operational expense, can significantly impact profitability as well. Moreover, the hash rate, a measure of a miner's computational power, directly affects the probability of successfully mining a block and receiving the associated rewards. Therefore, balancing these aspects is crucial for the long-term viability of a mining operation. A Peek into the Future The future of Bitcoin mining is set to face several challenges. With the Bitcoin network's difficulty level increasing and block rewards decreasing due to halving, profit margins are expected to shrink. As competition intensifies, the industry could see a trend toward centralization, where only well-funded entities can maintain competitiveness. This potential shift could threaten the security and decentralization that Bitcoin upholds, possibly pushing Bitcoin proponents to explore alternative consensus mechanisms. Despite the challenges, the BTC mining still holds immense potential. As MaskEX Academy points out, the industry's evolution is ""a testament to the relentless pursuit of progress and the unwavering belief in the power of decentralization.""

42393221,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgduuh,1688392465,"Bitcoin Unlikely to Be Destabilized by Real Yields, Crypto Observers Say","Inflation-adjusted yields on U.S. government bonds are rising after a nearly three-quarter lull, which has lead to renewed risk-taking in all corners of financial markets.  The uptick in the bond yield, also known as real yield, has some observers worried about potential risk aversion in stocks and the broader financial market. Some crypto observers, however, expect bitcoin (BTC) and digital assets, in general, to stay resilient.  The 5-year real yield rose to nearly 2% last week, topping the September 2022 high of 1.92% to hit the highest since late 2008, according to data tracked by TradingView. At 1.6%, the 10-year yield is just 11 basis points short of probing levels last seen in 2009. Meanwhile, the two-year real yield has reached 3%, the highest in at least ten years.  Rising real rates can put the brakes on economic growth and reduce the incentive to invest in risky or zero-yielding assets like bitcoin and gold. Bitcoin and Wall Street's tech-heavy index Nasdaq have historically moved in the opposite direction of real yields.  The latest spike in real yields is problematic for stocks rather than for digital assets, according to crypto banking firm BCB Group's head of OTC trading Richard Usher.  ""Real yields are an issue with a return in a one-year bond yielding 6%; it is now a genuine alternative to stock market exposure. The question to ask is which type of investor does this return appeal to,"" Usher said.  ""The typical investor in Crypto or Tech stocks is looking for a higher potential return or is investing for the longer term in the sector or asset class growth. Hence I suspect the rise in real yields is more a headache to blue chip stocks than to markets like technology or crypto and will not disrupt the medium-term growth story,"" Usher added.  Most macro traders, sensitive to changes in interest rates and inflation-adjusted bond yields, left the crypto market during last year's price crash, leaving long-term ""HODLers"" in control.  Treasury inflation-indexed securities are indexed to inflation – the non-seasonally adjusted U.S. city average all items consumer price index for all urban consumers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the data.  The five-year real yield has broken out of a nine-month consolidation pattern, signaling a continuation of the rally from December 2021 lows. So far, bitcoin and Nasdaq have ignored the uptick in the real yield.  Both assets took a beating in the first half of 2022, as a prolonged period of unconventional negative real yields, which supported rampant risk-taking and capital misallocation, ended with central banks resorting to the fastest pace of liquidity tightening in decades. Market mood improved after the uptrend in the real yield stalled in Q4 2022.  Per Ben Lilly, a crypto economist at Jarvis Labs, the increasing real borrowing cost may actually bring more capital to productive sectors like blockchain over the long run.  ""It just speaks to the normalization of the cost of capital. Many tend to lean into the narrative of crypto when things get bumpy and that's fine. I like to view crypto as a way to boost productivity. And when we look at the cost of capital being normalized, capital can start to be allocated to things that will bring higher productivity in the years to come,"" Lilly told CoinDesk.  ""I expect the normalization of yields to bring more money into areas of innovation like smart contracts, programmable money, and DeFi, which are expected to boost productivity,"" he added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/03/resurgent-us-inflation-adjusted-bond-yields-unlike-to-destabilise-bitcoin-crypto-observes-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6d5e05cd2cb566ff85ac29f634cce6e94ff1384-1740x1160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393215,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgdu5P,1688391924,Crypto ATM Operator Bitcoin Depot's Stock Rises 12% in Stock Debut,"Shares of Bitcoin Depot, the world's largest crypto ATM operator, rose nearly 12% in their Nasdaq debut Monday following a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) GSR II Meteora (GSRM) that was valued at $885 million in August.  Atlanta, Georgia-based Bitcoin Depot, trading under the ticker ""BTM,"" is the first crypto ATM operator to list on a major U.S. stock market.  It was a wild day of trading in the stock. The shares had risen as high as $6.60 in pre-market trading before pulling back to $3.39, up 5% from the Friday level shortly after the market opened.  BTM shares closed on Monday at $3.61, an increase of nearly 12% on GSRM's closing price on Friday.  Crypto ATMs enable users to buy crypto with cash or debit cards and wire the tokens directly to a particular wallet without going through a crypto exchange. However, they have also been used by scam artists, who list goods on sites like eBay or Craigslist with instructions for purchasers to pay by depositing physical currency in an ATM.  Bitcoin Depot operates over 6,000 such machines, representing a 20% market share of ATMs in the U.S. and a 17.6% global share, according to data from Coin ATM Radar.  With the crypto ATM market ""highly fragmented,"" according to Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz, there is a lot of room for consolidation in the sector, on which the firm is now setting its sights.  ""There's a few dozen operators with over 100 bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. alone and there has not been a lot of M&A activity in this space compared to other parts of the crypto and blockchain industry,"" Mintz told CoinDesk in an interview. ""Rolling up this highly fragmented market is a really exciting opportunity for us.""  Having installed ATMs at over 2,000 Circle K convenience stores in the last two years, Bitcoin Depot is planning on pursuing similar installation deals with other ""household name retailers"" as well as some smaller regional chains, Mintz added.

But what’s causing this sudden surge in its price? The answer lies in the anticipation of a major event that’s just around the corner: the impending halving of Litecoin, set to take place on August 2. Similar to Bitcoin, Litecoin undergoes halvings after a specific number of blocks are mined, roughly every four years. As the halving approaches, investors and enthusiasts are left wondering: will Litecoin’s price continue to soar, or is there more to this story than meets the eye? LTC trading at $112.35. Source: Coingecko Litecoin Price Rally And Resistance Breakthrough LTC has demonstrated a strong performance in recent days, currently trading at $112.35 according to CoinGecko. Over the past 24 hours, LTC experienced a notable rally of 5.1%, and within a seven-day timeframe, it surged by an astonishing 29.0%. Related Reading: Solana Firedancer: 15% Rally Fueled By Ongoing Network Improvements Over the weekend, LTC managed to surpass the crucial $100 mark, and since then, it has sustained trading above this key level of resistance. This resilience indicates bullish tendencies and raises the possibility of a significant breakthrough, with the potential for the $100 resistance to transform into support. Such a development could pave the way for a sustained bull run, potentially propelling the token to reach $130 in the near future. Social Activity Volume And Halving Event Hype The surge in LTC’s price has coincided with heightened social activity volume, as observed by the blockchain analytics firm Santiment. This suggests a correlation between price spikes and increased interest and engagement surrounding the crypto. LTC market cap nears the $8 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com The anticipation of Litecoin’s upcoming halving event has generated a surge in demand for the asset, driving its price upward. ⚡ #Litecoin is under 5 weeks away from its #halving, taking place on August 3rd. Prices have suddenly soared for $LTC, blasting off for a +26% in just over a day. Watch for mainstream #FOMO, as this usually foreshadows local tops until crowds calm down. https://t.co/KljBpjVy3C pic.twitter.com/7kDqEpyZjz — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 1, 2023 Litecoin’s halving events have historically been associated with significant price movements. In the months leading up to previous halvings, Litecoin experienced notable price surges. These halvings have been pivotal moments for the crypto asset, often triggering a period of increased market activity and bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Why AVAX Price Rumble Stalls Despite Surge In Daily Activity The underlying principle behind the price surge observed before halving events is the anticipation of reduced supply coupled with sustained or growing demand. As the number of new coins entering the market decreases, if demand remains steady or increases, the scarcity of Litecoin can drive up its price. This scarcity narrative has been a driving force behind the previous bull runs experienced by Litecoin, and the upcoming halving event is expected to generate similar dynamics.

Fang Gang are a non-fungible tokens collection built on the Ethereum network launched in 28 August, 2021. 8,886 items of the Fang Gang collection can now be viewed at OpenSea. How many owners does the Fang Gang collection have? The total number of owners has reached 4141 within 673 days since its release. NFT Collection Fang Gang Price and Sales The market capitalization of Fang Gang NFT collection is 202.56 ETH. Since created the Fang Gang, 23,226 collections sales were made at an average price of 0.27 ETH (~$524.42 at the time of writing). This created a total volume in 6,212.415 ETH. The floor price of Fang Gang is 0.0211 and the 30-day trading volume is kept at 2.50 ETH. The payment tokens of the Fang Gang collection are ETH, DAI, WETH, USDC, APE. Why are some NFTs expensive and others not? NFTs are very new to the blockchain ecosystem and are still in their infancy. It is an emerging market meaning there is no historical data or precedence that can assist in determining the value of an NFT. NFT projects that started at the beginning of the market boom have garnered legitimacy purely because they had a first-mover advantage. These “established” NFT projects have also had the opportunity to improve and learn from the issues that have plagued the NFT market and have, in such a way, made themselves more valuable. When the NFT boom took flight, many people realized profits beyond their wildest dreams, creating a space for opportunists to take advantage of the market growth. While some NFTs can be considered digital art, created by an artist who recognizes the value NFTs can add to the creative space, others have been made purely out of greed and a need to exploit the immense market growth. NFT projects that stem from greed and exploitation often have no value and are ultimately garbage. Is the Fang Gang Collection Over or Underpriced? It is difficult to determine whether NFTs from the Fang Gang collection is overpriced or underpriced. Making such an assessment will become clearer when the market for NFTs and metaverses develops more actively. The price is also influenced by how the Fang Gang collection is developed and promoted by its creators and community.

Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Have Continued To Add To Their Holdings According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC sharks and whales have participated in further buying during the past two weeks. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that each address group is holding in the market right now. The addresses are divided into these address groups based on the total number of coins they are carrying in their balances right now. The 1-10 coins group, for instance, includes all investors holding between 1 and 10 BTC currently. In the context of the current discussion, the cohorts of interest are the “sharks” and “whales.” These are investors who generally hold sizeable sums in their wallets, and their combined coin range may be defined as 10-10,000 coins. Due to the high amounts that these holders may carry in their wallets, they can have some influence on the market. Naturally, as the whales are the larger of the two groups, they carry significantly more power in the sector. As the movements of these holders can cause noticeable effects on the market, it can be worth keeping an eye on their behaviors. The Supply Distribution of this coin range can provide hints related to exactly that. Now, here is a chart that shows how the supply of these investors has changed during the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for the 10-10,000 coins group had seen some decline earlier in the year but had bottomed out in the middle of April. Around the same time as the whales finishing up their selling, the asset’s price had hit a local top and had observed a drop over the next couple of months. While this decline had taken place, though, these sharks and whales had started growing their holdings once again, suggesting that they had been buying the dips. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Flock To Bitcoin: Are We Witnessing A Paradigm Shift? Later on, when the cryptocurrency had failed to show any signs of a resurgence, the supply of these investors had hit a standstill, implying that these investors had become hesitant to buy more. Following the bottom in June, however, and the subsequent emergence of news related to new ETF launches, these sharks and whales began to show some strong accumulation. In the past seven weeks, these investors have loaded up 154,500 BTC, a good chunk of which has come during the past couple of weeks alone. The indicator’s value has now reached 13 million BTC, implying that the Bitcoin sharks and whales now hold 67% of the total circulating supply.

42393225,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgdv4x,1688387248,First Mover Americas: Traders Place Big Bets on Ether for Second Half of 2023,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, jumped 61% in the first six months of the year. Traders are now betting the rally could extend in the second half. On Friday, an investor purchased roughly 63,250 ""bull call spreads"" tied to ether and due for expiry on Dec. 29, according to data source Amberdata. The trade involved the sale of a call option at the $2,500 strike price to partly fund the purchase of a call option at the $1,900 strike. The strategy cost an initial $10 million because the trader entity shelled out more to buy the $1,900 call than they received from selling the $2,500 call. A call buyer gets protection from the seller against price rallies. In return, the seller receives an upfront premium from the buyer.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance on spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF) is a difficult one to hold, and the probability for approval is fairly high, brokerage firm Bernstein said in a research report Monday. Bernstein notes that the SEC already allows futures-based bitcoin ETFs, and recently approved leverage based futures ETFs on the premise that futures pricing comes from a regulated exchange like the CME. According to analysts led by Gautam Chhugani, the SEC believes that a spot bitcoin ETF would not be dependable because the “spot exchanges (e.g. Coinbase) are not under its regulation, and thus spot prices are not reliable and prone to manipulation.”  Crypto service providers in Singapore would need to deposit customer assets into a statutory trust before the end of the year for safekeeping, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on Monday. The requirement comes after the MAS received public consultation around enhancing customer protection initiated in October 2022. ""This will mitigate the risk of loss or misuse of customers’ assets, and facilitate the recovery of customers’ assets in the event of a DPT (Digital Payment Token or Cryptocurrency) service provider’s insolvency,"" the central bank said. The MAS has also restricted cryptocurrency service providers from facilitating lending and staking of tokens by their retail customers but institutional and accredited investors could continue to take advantage of these services.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the average year-on-year growth rate of four Asian economies – Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and China.  The export growth rate has tumbled, signaling a slowdown in the global economy. It also means Asian nations may resort to currency devaluation, boosting demand for perceived inflation hedges like gold and bitcoin.

Buterin Feels Sorry For Rival Solana In the midst of the ongoing regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has extended his sympathy to Solana, a rival blockchain platform, in light of the legal actions taken by the SEC against Binance and Coinbase, both renowned cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Buterin voiced his concerns over what he perceived as an unfair approach to crypto regulation, labeling the SEC's actions as unjust. Buterin Questions SEC’s Moves Buterin's comments were made during an online discussion with Matt Huang, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Paradigm, a crypto-focused venture capital firm. While the SEC's actions are aimed at protecting investors, Buterin believes that the approach lacks nuance and could impede the progress of the industry as a whole. When asked how he felt about the United States’s crypto policy, Buterin expressed his sympathy, saying, “The one comment I'll make is that I feel bad that Solana and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don’t deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up ‘winning’ through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that’s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn’t even a victory.” SEC Names SOL As Unregistered Security Solana, which has gained significant attention and experienced rapid growth in recent times, is among the projects facing increased scrutiny from the SEC. The regulatory agency has been actively investigating projects in the crypto sector to ensure compliance with existing securities laws. It has accused the major crypto firms of Binance and Coinbase of offering unregistered securities to the public. Naturally, these legal actions have also affected other major tokens, like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Algorand (ALGO), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), Sandbox (SAND), Axie infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), BNB (BNB), and others. “Centralized World Imposing On Decentralized Space” Buterin's sympathy for Solana reflects a broader sentiment within the crypto community, with many expressing concerns about the regulatory uncertainty faced by various projects. Industry participants are calling for clear guidelines and regulations that promote innovation and safeguard investor interests without stifling technological advancements. Buterin underscores that the crypto firms need to stand united as the true opponent is not each other but the “rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on the decentralized space.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14459912,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540840,1688383255,"Shiba Inu Lead Dev Teases Shibarium Launch, How High Can SHIB Rise?","Excitement is building within the Shiba Inu community as the highly anticipated launch of Shibarium, the layer-2 scaling solution, draws near. Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous project lead developer, recently addressed the upcoming launch, emphasizing the importance of sticking to the planned strategy and timeline. Kusama’s confident statements have further fueled anticipation among enthusiasts. Shibarium Is On The Verge Of Release When asked about potential changes to the launch date or plan of Shibarium, Kusama responded resolutely, stating, “It doesn’t matter; everything is already set. I can’t change the date or plan. It’s called a launch strategy.” This unwavering commitment to the established timeline demonstrates the Sharium developers team’s dedication to ensuring a successful launch for Shibarium. In another intriguing conversation within a Telegram group chat, someone identified as Mark suggested that Shibarium would launch at ETHToronto which takes place from August 15-16, 2023, in Toronto Canada. Surprisingly, the Shiba Inu lead developer playfully agreed, stating, “Mark his words.” This playful interaction has fueled speculation that Mark is actually right with his speculation. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Shares Mysterious ‘Where’ Video As SHIB Readies For Breakout? It is noteworthy that Kusama recently dropped another hint in which he said that it is no longer a question of “when” but “where”. The SHIB lead developer released a video showing the Shiba Inu logo and a major (North American) city. The message of the video was, “Something is coming. We are actually going somewhere.” Apparently the developers of Shiba Inu are planning a big event, and as the rumors have it, for the Shibarium launch. While the exact launch date remains undisclosed, another Shiba Inu enthusiast brought up a previous statement from Kusama in which he hinted at a two to four-month timeframe for the launch after the beta testing start. Notably, July 11 marks the four-month milestone since the beta release. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Surges Over 6,000% As SHIB Price Continues Uptrend And there’s even more recent hint from Kusama. In another Telegram message, he said: “I’m to busy starting the launch process of a blockchain. And seriously … when the pilot is in the cockpit switching switches and the seat belt light is on. And the attendant is talking about safety and stuff DONT ASK THE PILOT WEN.” So everything suggests that the Shibarium may be within reach. When and where remains a secret for the time being. How High Can The Shiba Inu Price Rise? The news of a launch date will undoubtedly create new hype around Shiba Inu. What impact Shibarium will have on the SHIB price in the long term is difficult to predict, as this will depend on the adoption and success of the layer-2 solution and projects that build on it. In the short term, however, a look at the 1-day chart of SHIB helps to assess possible price scenarios. The SHIB price remains in a downtrend on the 1-day chart, but is relentlessly approaching the upper resistance of the descending parallel trend channel at around $0.00000790. Crossing this price level would be a first important step to initiate a long-term upward movement. However, as early as the $0.00000834 price level (23.6% Fibonacci retracement level), SHIB needs to confirm this trend. In any case, the introduction of Shibarium has the potential to trigger this move. A green candle towards the 200-day EMA would then be conceivable. The 200-day EMA is currently approaching the 38.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000979. This area around $0.00001 is where the strongest resistance is expected. Still, the Shibarium hype has the potential to herald a further rise towards the 61.8% Fibonacci level at $0.000012. Thus, at the current price, SHIB holds the potential to rise by more than 57% (before probably taking a breather). The area around $0.000012 has been very important as resistance and later support this year.

42393218,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgduV3,1688381559,Probability for U.S. Approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF Is Fairly High: Bernstein,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance on spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded-funds (ETF) is a difficult one to hold, and the probability for approval is fairly high, brokerage firm Bernstein said in a research report Monday.  Bernstein notes that the SEC had already allowed futures based bitcoin ETFs, and recently approved leverage based futures ETFs on the premise that futures pricing comes from a regulated exchange like the CME.  According to analysts led by Gautam Chhugani, the SEC believes that a spot bitcoin ETF would not be dependable because the “spot exchanges (e.g. Coinbase) are not under its regulation, and thus spot prices are not reliable and prone to manipulation.”  The regulator has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF despite receiving numerous applications. A unit of Blackrock filed paperwork last month for the formation of a spot bitcoin ETF. This prompted other asset managers such as Invesco and Wisdom Tree to apply or reapply for a bitcoin ETF product.  The report flagged Grayscale's bid to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), currently before an appeals court.  “The court did not sound convinced that the futures price is not derived from the spot price, and thus to allow a futures based ETF and not allow spot sounds like a difficult pill to swallow for the courts,” the analysts wrote.  Furthermore, the industry has also now suggested a surveillance agreement between the spot exchange operator and a regulated exchange such as Nasdaq, the report said.  The lack of a bitcoin spot ETF leads to the growth of over-the-counter products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which are more expensive, illiquid and inefficient, the broker said. Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG).  “SEC would rather bring in a regulated bitcoin ETF led by more mainstream Wall Street participants and with surveillance from existing regulated exchanges, than having to deal with a Grayscale OTC product filling the institutional gap,” the report said.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in a statement on Monday that the country will require cryptocurrency exchange to keep customer assets in a trust before the end of the year. BNN Bloomberg and The Strait Times report the new requirement is part of efforts to ensure funds are safeguarded following the implosion of the FTX crypto exchange in November 2022. Singapore To Ban Staking and Lending for Retail Investors The MAS said there is support across the board for digital payment token (DPT) service providers to safeguard customer funds. The Strait Times reports under the proposed rules, firms must conduct daily reconciliation of customers’ assets, maintain proper records, and must maintain access and operational controls to customers’ DPTs in the region. According to reports, Singapore will also continue with a proposal to ban lending and staking activities for retail investors. The monetary authority stated lending and staking activities are unsuitable for the retail public. The MAS said in a statement: Regulations alone cannot protect consumers from all losses, given the extremely high risk and speculative nature of digital payment token trading. The authority said crypto firms could continue to offer such services to their institutional and accredited investors. Singapore Tightens Crypto Regulations Singapore’s measures to protect retail investors come after its public consultation in October 2022. The city-state has, for a long time, pushed for strengthened crypto regulations. The MAS announced in 2022 that its plans to consult and revise its proposed regulations which will further tighten retail-investor access to cryptocurrencies.

He has expanded his involvement in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by presenting his second NFT collection. This offering aims to celebrate Ronaldo’s exceptional accomplishments throughout his illustrious career, particularly showcasing his unique goals in soccer. Celebrating Cristiano Ronaldo’s Illustrious Career Goals Set to launch on July 3, this new collection will present a diverse selection of 20 unique designs that symbolize significant milestones from Ronaldo’s impressive journey. These designs have been divided into four levels of rarity, ensuring collectors have various options based on their preferences. Each design elegantly captures memorable moments from Ronaldo’s goal-scoring genius—whether a breathtaking bicycle kick or a powerful long-range strike. Each piece encapsulates the essence of Ronaldo’s outstanding ability to find the back of the net. Related Reading: FTX Puts Sale Of $500 Million Stake In AI Firm Anthropic On Hold In the collection, there are highly sought-after items known as NFTs that stand out. These particular NFTs possess six distinct designs, making them exceptionally rare. Only 120 special products exist, turning these super-rare NFTs into valuable collector possessions. Aside from having exclusive digital ownership, each super rare NFT comes with exceptional advantages for its owner. Notably, one of these benefits includes receiving a soccer jersey personally autographed by Cristiano Ronaldo himself—a truly unique and invaluable item that holds immense significance to any football devotee. Anticipation For Cristiano Ronaldo’s Second NFT Collection Cristiano Ronaldo’s initial non-fungible token (NFT) collection encountered a difficult start in the market, facing several challenges. These obstacles emerged during a period marked by significant complexities, ultimately influencing how this collection was received and performed. Related Reading: FTT Flies 45% On Rumors Of FTX Planned Relaunch Among the various hurdles confronted by the first collection, one significant challenge arose when it was launched merely a week following the collapse of the FTX Derivatives Exchange. The demise of FTX had substantial ramifications on general crypto market sentiments, resulting in an overall decline and eroding investor trust. Nonetheless, given the increasing traction and comprehension of NFTs among collectors and enthusiasts alike, alongside possible improvements in market conditions, there is potential for Ronaldo’s second collection to attract a broader audience. Addressing Legal And Regulatory Challenges In The NFT Market The advent of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has given rise to legal and regulatory complexities on a global scale. This issue primarily stems from lacking an internationally acknowledged legal definition for NFTs. However, countries are currently developing their systems for classifying NFTs, highlighting the urgent need for a worldwide organization that can set universal regulations and legitimize these digital assets. As the NFT market continues to experience substantial expansion, it becomes even more crucial to establish a governing agency that can effectively address these challenges.

42393223,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgduzp,1688375504,A $10M Options Bet on Ether Shows Positioning for a Bullish Second Half,"Ether (ETH) jumped 61% in the first six months of the year. Traders are now betting the rally in the token of Ethereum, the world's biggest smart-contract blockchain, could extend in the second half.  On Friday, an investor purchased roughly 63,250 ""bull call spreads"" tied to ether and due for expiry on Dec. 29, according to data source Amberdata. The trade involved the sale of a call option at the $2,500 strike price to partly fund the purchase of a call option at the $1,900 strike.  The strategy cost an initial $10 million as the trading entity shelled out more to buy the $1,900 call than it received from selling the $2,500 call. A call buyer gets protection from the seller against price rallies. In return, the call seller receives an upfront premium from the buyer.  ""For Ethereum to highlight call spread $1,900-$2,500 on December for around $10M of net premium paid: MASSIVE,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a newsletter late Sunday.  The strike prices chosen suggest a predominant desire for bullish directional exposure, Magadini said. One ether options contract represents one ETH.  Bull call spreads, or bullish vertical spreads, are quite popular in traditional markets as well as crypto because they limit potential losses and profit.  The strategy will be profitable as ether's price rises, although the profit potential is constrained to the difference between the strike prices minus the initial cost pair. The strategy will be unprofitable if ether trades below $1,900 at the end of December. The loss, however, is limited to the extent of the initial cost paid.  The indication is that the buyer of the bull call spread probably expects a gradual ether price increase over the next six months.  ""Bullish call spreads are typical directional trades,"" Chang, a partner and analyst at crypto data tracking platform Greeks.Live, told CoinDesk, adding that increased interest in these strategies does not necessarily promise an ether rally. Crypto services provider Matrixport, however, says ether is due for a notable move higher.  Ether changed hands at $1,966 at press time, the highest since May 6, according to CoinDesk data.  ""During the mid-June 223 lows, we got a buy signal when ether traded at $1,700. Now at $1,920, prices have rallied, but we think the chance for an explosive move higher has arrived,"" Matrixport's head of research and strategy, Markus Thielen, said. ""Ether could catch up with bitcoin.""  Bitcoin rallied by nearly 85% in the first half, outshining many other coins by a wide margin.

The crypto community had high hopes for the AVAX price to surpass the $14 mark, signifying a significant milestone in the asset’s growth. However, despite the increased interest and activity surrounding the crypto, the price failed to breach the elusive barrier. This unexpected development has left many wondering about the underlying factors contributing to this stagnation in price movement. What’s going on with AVAX? Related Reading: Solana Firedancer: 15% Rally Fueled By Ongoing Network Improvements Surge In Daily Activity Fails To Propel AVAX The current AVAX price on CoinGecko stands at $13.26, showcasing a 2.9% rally over the last 24 hours.

Source: Coingecko Avalanche witnessed an impressive surge in daily activity, yet this accomplishment did not translate into the expected boost for AVAX to break through the critical $14 resistance level. According to a price report, AVAX has been experiencing a series of lower lows since mid-April, signaling a strong downtrend. During this period, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has remained below or just slightly above the neutral position, indicating muted buying pressure in the market. AVAX 7-day price movement.

However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) has crossed the mid-level point, suggesting a recent easing of buying pressure while notable trading volume remains. Given the current technical indicators and market conditions, AVAX’s price is likely to consolidate within the range of $12 to $13.5 in the coming days. Bitcoin’s Consolidation Above $30,000 Affects AVAX Price Bitcoin’s prolonged consolidation above the $30,000 level has played a significant role in shaping the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment, including AVAX’s price movement. As one of the leading digital assets, Bitcoin often sets the tone for the overall market, impacting investor confidence and risk appetite. AVAX market cap below the $5 billion mark.

14455917,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/bitcoin-has-momentum-on-its-side-this-time,1688373999,Bitcoin has momentum on its side this time,"Another weekly close above $30,000 means bitcoin is still primed to break through the all-important $31,000 resistance. Bitcoin has more in the tank Another week passes and bitcoin is still at the locked gate that provides a potential quick passage to $36,000 and beyond. This is the second major attempt at this resistance, and with more in the tank this time, bitcoin could do the business. “More in the tank” points to the fact that momentum is on bitcoin’s side this time. When the king of the cryptocurrencies last came up against the $31,000 barrier it was on the back of a surge from $20,000, and all the momentum had evaporated by the time it reached the most important level. Momentum indicators move higher Currently bitcoin is at resistance and is moving sideways before potentially breaking through. On the longer time frame of the weekly, the Stochastic RSI (momentum indicator) is getting to around half way up, and heading higher - an extremely bullish signal. Going into lower time frames, both the 8-hour and 12-hour have bottomed and are heading higher, and the daily time frame is now on the way down. Back in April when bitcoin was at these levels all these time frames were at the overbought level and of course, with bitcoin having arrived at resistance in exhaustion, there was only one way to go and that was back down. Another reason for optimism is that bitcoin has broken through the top of the bull flag it has formed since that last April rejection. Granted, it hasn’t shot out of the top and headed higher straight away. Instead, it has followed a process of going back inside the flag and then just sideways action now that it has emerged again. Is bitcoin such a risk asset? Perhaps bitcoin is just waiting for that particular bullish news that will break the inertia and send it rocketing upwards. All the same, nothing much has changed in traditional finance, and the much feared recession (that could be worse than recession) is still that black cloud that all can see on the horizon. Some analysts might say that in a heavy market crash bitcoin is bound to be the first to drop precipitously as investors divest themselves of their risk assets first. However, it could very much be argued that even if this were the case, bitcoin is the scarcest asset on the planet and the most uncorrelated to all the assets inside of the traditional financial system. In such a chaotic mess with governments going to the money printers to try and prop everything up, bitcoin is likely to be extremely valuable property indeed.

42393213,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgduFf,1688373766,Singapore's MAS Orders Crypto Firms to Keep Customer Assets in a Trust by Year-End,"Crypto service providers in Singapore would need to deposit customer assets under a statutory trust before the end of the year for safekeeping, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on Monday.  The requirement comes after the MAS received public consultation around enhancing customer protection initiated in October 2022.  ""This will mitigate the risk of loss or misuse of customers’ assets, and facilitate the recovery of customers’ assets in the event of a DPT (Digital Payment Token or Cryptocurrency) service provider’s insolvency,"" the MAS said.  The MAS has also restricted cryptocurrency service providers from facilitating lending and staking tokens to retail customers, but institutional and accredited investors could continue to take advantage of these services.  Singapore's central bank has also asked for public feedback on legislative amendments focused on the implementation of the latest requirements.  “This latest tightening of retail access to crypto should be no surprise to anyone following the Singapore market,” said Angela Ang, Senior Policy Advisor for blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs and former MAS regulator. “MAS’ decision to hold back on certain proposals, such as requiring an independent custodian for customer assets, shows it’s listening to the industry and is sensitive to practical considerations such as a dearth of third-party custodians.”  Ang also told CoinDesk via email that Singapore's requirements are identical to other payment service providers and are not as strict as Hong Kong's rules. Singapore now requires 90% of customer crypto to be held in crypto wallets, unlike Hong Kong's requirement of 98%, and cold wallets are not required to be onshore, unlike in Hong Kong.  The MAS indicated that its position on banning crypto entities from facilitating lending and staking of tokens for retail customers could change in the future.  “Some respondents suggested to allow DPT service providers to offer these activities with the retail customer’s consent and risk disclosures, while others advocated a ban on these high-risk and speculative activities,” the MAS said. “MAS will monitor market developments and consumer risk awareness as these evolve, and will take steps to ensure that our measures remain balanced and appropriate.”  Singapore's commitment towards supporting technologies of the industry to improve existing traditional financial systems goes hand in hand with its stated objective of being ""brutal and unrelentingly hard"" on bad behaviour in the crypto industry. Last month, the MAS also proposed ways to design open, interoperable networks for tokenized digital assets and standards for the use of digital money.

From a significant decline in Bitcoin inflows to a historic drop in supply on exchanges, coupled with a surge in institutional fund accumulation, these developments highlight a maturing market and changing investor sentiment. Unprecedented Decline In Bitcoin Inflows and Supply The on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant has today published extremely interesting data on the behavior and cohorts of Bitcoin hodlers via Twitter. Over the past 612 days, Bitcoin has witnessed an 80% decline in the number of addresses recording inflows, which can be interpreted as selling activity. This decline reaches an even higher figure of 84% when measured from the peak in May 2021. These numbers even surpass the previous record set during the 2017 parabolic top, demonstrating the magnitude of the current trend. Both narrowly beat the second highest decline in addresses associated with inflows between the 2017 parabolic top into 2018 bear, at 78.5%. It is important to note that these figures do not account for addresses that have moved to self-custody or differentiate between miner activity and retail investors. This suggests that the decline in addresses associated with inflows may be even more significant than the data implies, potentially indicating a shift towards long-term holding strategies or alternative custodial methods. Related Reading: Binance CEO Goes Bullish On Bitcoin – What’s The Inside Scoop? In a parallel trend, the overall supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has been steadily shrinking since March 2020, marking a period of consistent decline that had not been witnessed before in Bitcoin’s history. This decline is not only significant in its duration but also in its depth, as Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have dropped by over 30%. CryptoQuant’s experts further note: March 2020 was the highest ever supply recorded on exchanges, and preceded by consistent ten years of supply growth. The 1200 days since, are the first period of consistent decline in Bitcoin’s history. Retail traders and institutions are holding more Bitcoin than ever. This also indicates a major potential shift from active trading and speculative behavior towards long-term holding strategies. Institutional Fund Accumulation Signals Confidence As the decline in inflows and supply unfolds, another intriguing trend emerges: institutional fund accumulation, as observed by CryptoQuant. Institutional investors, including hedge funds, investment firms, and cryptocurrency private funds, are currently actively increasing their holdings of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Takes A Hit As SEC Deems Spot ETF Filings ‘Inadequate’ This exponential increase in fund holdings demonstrates a strong interest in acquiring Bitcoin, even at its current price level. Institutional investors often take a more patient and long-term approach compared to short-term traders who closely monitor price fluctuations. By closely monitoring fund holdings, investors can gain valuable insights into market sentiment and the confidence that institutional investors have in Bitcoin as a long-term asset. And the following chart by CryptoQuant is showing just that, an ultra bullish stance by institutions. The positive evolution of Bitcoin’s perception is probably further reinforced by recent developments in the regulatory landscape and the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Regulatory frameworks, especially those being implemented by countries in the European Union with MiCA, are beneficial for the institutional Bitcoin adoption. Moreover, the filings and re-filings of Bitcoin spot ETFs by major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, indicate a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a legitimate investment. These ETFs provide a more accessible and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially driving further institutional adoption and market growth. At press time, the BTC price stood at $30,716, remaining in its range between $29,800 and $31,000.

42393212,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgduAX,1688370360,AzukiDAO Votes on 'Reclaim' of 20K Ether After Botched Elementals NFT Mint,"A group of holders of Azuki non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is voting for the return of nearly 20,000 ether a week after the Elementals NFT mint, citing reasons ranging from disappointment with the collection to alleging the team to have “blatantly scammed” purchasers.  The vote proposes to allocate any funds retrieved back to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to “promote the growth of the entire Azuki community” such as providing rewards and incentives for artists, content creators and builders. The newly formed DAO had 72 members as of Monday, with just 36 votes on the proposal, and nearly 40% of the “yes” votes coming from a single holder.  Chiru Labs, the company behind the Azuki NFT, last week released Elementals as an add-on to the Azuki ecosystem and raked in $38 million worth of ether in 15 minutes. The collection, however, was slammed by holders and market watchers.  Community reactions had a common thread: That some of the new NFTs looked too similar to the Azuki collection, released February 2022, despite Elementals having a different branding story. The floor price of the Azuki tanked by nearly 50% and Chiru Labs is now taking steps to correct its mistakes.  But some Azuki DAO members seem to want their money back. A proposal floated over the weekend saw 88% of voters in favor of a plan for the money sent to the Elementals mint to be returned to users instead of getting newer NFTs.  “We have provided support to Azuki during its highs and lows. We have contributed to building a sub-community and promoting the brand in various ways,” DAO members wrote in the Friday proposal. “Despite our efforts, we have only been given a similar profile picture to that of the original Azuki holders, and nothing more. The team is blatantly scamming us with empathy checks and promises.”  The members proposed hiring a lawyer to take legal action against Azuki creator “Zagabond” for allegedly “rugging” multiple projects. A rug pull occurs when a developer or creator promotes a project such as a new coin or NFT release and then disappears with investor money.  Some crypto enthusiasts on Twitter, however, have questioned the authenticity of AzukiDAO and its intent.  “Most Azuki holders have never heard of this group and assume it’s either fake or a group with malicious intent,” tweeted Nfty Finance founder @Tytaninc. “The token for voting was minted two days ago sooo there’s that,” they added.  In a Twitter message to CoinDesk, AzukiDAO said it was made up of ex-core contributors to Azuki and that it was made of a group of “diamond handed” NFT holders.”  The group further added its proposal may “force zagabond to do something positive.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/03/azukidao-votes-on-reclaim-of-20k-ether-after-botched-elementals-nft-mint,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/915f64a360fa365b8042974edefdf511c5a241bc-1280x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Poly Network confirmed the hack, adding that it would be temporarily suspending all services. 57 Crypto Assets Impacted The attack on Poly Network occurred on the 2nd of July, resulting in the hacker being able to issue billions of tokens seemingly out of thin air to generate a profit. Poly Network confirmed the attack through its official Twitter handle, stating that it had become the latest DeFi entity to fall victim to a hack, adding that it was temporarily suspending services. The update also stated that the exploit had impacted 57 crypto assets based on ten blockchains, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, OKx, Heco, and others. While it isn’t clear how much has been stolen in the attack, PeckShield has reported that the attacker had transferred at least $5 million worth of crypto from the cross-chain bridge. In an update issued on the 3rd of July, the Poly Network team stated, “We have already initiated communication with centralized exchanges and law enforcement agencies and sought their assistance.” The team further advised token holders to withdraw liquidity and unlock their liquidity provider tokens. Poly Network Hack Breakdown According to DeFi security analyst @0xArhat, the exploit stemmed from a smart contract vulnerability that allowed the hackers to create a malicious parameter that contained a fake validator signature and block header. The smart contract accepted this malicious parameter, allowing the hacker to bypass the verification process and issue tokens from Poly Network’s Ethereum pool to their address on other chains such as BNB Chain, Polygon, and Metis. The same procedure was repeated for other chains, resulting in a massive pile-up of tokens. According to @0xArhat, the hacker’s wallet held over $42 billion worth of tokens at one point. However, the hacker could only convert and steal a fraction of the tokens. The attackers had minted 24 billion Binance USD (BUSD) and BNB on the Metis blockchain, 999 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) on the Heco blockchain, and millions of other tokens on other prominent networks such as Polygon and Avalanche. “This way, the hacker was able to mint billions of tokens on various blockchains that did not exist before and transfer them to their own wallet addresses.” Dedaub has dubbed the latest hack to hit Poly Network as the “34 billion Poly Network hack.” He also highlighted several weaknesses in the protocol’s multi-sig, adding that it only had a simple 3 of 4 multi-signature arrangement for over two years. “Getting to the bottom of the “34 billion” Poly network hack with a technical postmortem. TL;DR Poly network had a simple 3 of 4 multisig arrangement over 2 years! Looking at the final event, we found that the private keys to the addresses marked were compromised.” According to the blockchain security solutions provider, the attack was not complex, as no logic bugs were exploited. Poly Network itself was slow to respond, eventually costing the platform $5.5 million in stolen crypto. However, a lack of liquidity in a majority of the tokens in question prevented further significant losses. Binance, Polygon Reassure Users Following the attack on the Poly Network, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that the exploit does not impact Binance users, adding that it did not support deposits from the Poly Network. Polygon’s Mudit Gupta stated on Twitter, “Poly Network got rekt again, allegedly because of compromised hot keys. It’s going to keep happening until our industry changes our approach to security. Smart contract audits only scratch the surface. Ps Poly network has NOTHING to do with Polygon.” Poly Network’s Previous Hack This was the second time a major hack hit the Poly Network. In August 2021, the protocol was hit by attackers who managed to drain a then-record $600 million through the alleged leak of a private key that was used to sign a cross-chain message. As a result, the Poly Network lost $264 million in ETH, $250 million in BSC, and $85 million in MATIC. However, Poly Network later updated that the hacker had returned the stolen funds, with the hacker claiming the attack was orchestrated for fun, and even offered the anonymous hacker a job as the Chief Security Advisor to the protocol, adding that it won’t be pressing any charges.

Shorts and longs cumulatively lost over $25 million on BCH-tracked futures, which may have contributed to the sudden spike. Shorts refer to bets against any asset, while longs are bets on price rises.  As of Monday, funding rates have fallen negative across all exchanges that list BCH futures. Negative funding rates indicate that short traders are dominant and are willing to pay long traders to remain in their positions.  BCH traders are paying funding rates as much as -0.05% every 8 hours in fees to exchanges, implying short interest in the tokens is rising.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.

Bitcoin is opening the trading week in Asia at $30,654, according to CoinDesk data, while ether is at $1,938. CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin Trend Indicator is showing that the world’s largest digital asset is going through a “significant uptrend” period.  Crypto had a rough end to last week, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that current bitcoin ETF filings were “inadequate” sending prices down. Some of the issuers have re-filed, naming Coinbase as their market surveillance partner.  BitBull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale sees bitcoin potentially testing a support zone between $27K-$29K, and he says that such price action is likely to result in deeper declines in altcoins.  “Last week, we highlighted how Bitcoin staying above $30K would be positive for the market. This week we saw some of that sentiment shift toward alts, as ETH showed signs of wanting to test $2K, and other altcoins also rallied,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “Market participants will do well to remain cautious of sustained upside momentum.”  Despite the week opening with a holiday, this week will see some major economic events, with the June FOMC minutes being published on Wednesday – which will give more insight into how the Fed will next move on interest rates – JOLTs Job openings on Thursday, and new unemployment numbers on Friday.  Traders will no doubt be balancing all of that against news of the SEC’s next steps on the bitcoin ETFs.

Or a Few Years in the Past?  Explore the Japanese internet for a while, and you’ll find that it looks a bit ancient.  You can do many more things online in Japan than you could in the West, but there are a few notable exceptions, and overall the country’s Web2 space feels a decade out of date. Think about how the Web looked like when the iPhone 4 came out.  “The government really felt that we totally missed Web2...So now they see Web3 as something Japan could potentially embrace and create the new generation of Japanese tech companies and tech visionaries in this space,"" said Akio Tanaka, a founding partner of IVC, which recently hosted its IVS Crypto and Web Conference in Kyoto.  “There are no Web2 giants from Japan,” he continued.  Much has been written about Japan’s regulatory successes in these early days of Web3. Unlike the U.S., which has been openly hostile to the industry, Japan is seemingly embracing it and has worked to regulate it – regulations that were born in blood after the collapse of Mt. Gox in 2013. And, in the end, Japan was the safest place to be an FTX customer.  But what does the celebration of Web3 look like in Japan?  A lot like it did at the height of the bull market in the West.  NFTs and GameFi are big, and curiously, so is enterprise blockchain. Some of Japan’s largest companies are announcing that they have a Web3 strategy, and lots of money is being thrown around, but these strategies are still ambiguous (think: “carbon credit trading” or “healthcare records”) and on the drawing boards.  Tanaka emphasizes that in Japan, this will all be different.  Japanese GameFi developers, for instance, “want to serve gamers, not crypto speculators,” he said.  “They will probably not try to create the same kind of speculative move that you may have seen outside of Japan, because they realize that can actually backfire and negatively impact their core game fans,” he continued.  Sega knows this well, as when it first mentioned it was entering the NFT space. It was hit with a strong backlash from fans, and recalibrated its stance, saying that if its venture into Web3 were “perceived as simple money-making…it would make a decision not to proceed.”  Same with Square Enix. While the stock market liked its decision to embrace NFTs, starting with characters from Final Fantasy 7 – considered to be the best iteration of its long-running franchise – fans hated the idea.  In the end, Square Enix’s NFTs weren’t really something for speculation, as the on-chain assets are “frozen” to the wallet that bought them.  One help can’t think that this embrace of Web 3 might be a bit more conservative than the bulls say it is, once you peel away the layers.  Despite all the talk of GameFi and NFTs at the show, Japan’s best-known IP is staying well away from it, aside from Square’s experiment. Nintendo was looking to hire an NFT and metaverse expert in March, but nothing has materialized (Tanaka says that if Nintendo does anything, it would be the last to do it).  Even the Japanese Prime Minister’s speech which opened the conference, didn’t mention Web3 by name, only generic platitudes about the importance of startups to economic growth and his government’s plans to make Japan a friendly market for these startups.  But there is something there, even if it's not what the evangelists say it is.  As the interview with Tanaka wound to a close, the next group, a corporate delegation from Sega, arrived early.  Sega, an investor in IVC, has recently been in the news dismissing rumors that it plans to be acquired. A spokesperson for IVC declined to comment as to what the meeting was about, but it probably involved crypto.
