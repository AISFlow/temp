42425455,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2ONh,1392762427,Canadian Bank Cuts Cointrader Accounts Amid Hostile Government Rhetoric,"Bank of Montreal, the fourth-largest bank in Canada, has closed all Cointrader customer and corporate accounts, the Vancouver-based exchange revealed via blog post on 17th February.  Most notably, Cointrader suggested that the decision is part of a broader move by Bank of Montreal to sever ties with all of the virtual currency businesses it serves.  Cointrader CTO and co-founder Paul Szczesny said such a move would have a larger impact on the country's burgeoning bitcoin ecosystem, and blamed recent warnings from the Canadian government for the bank's decision.  Said Szczesny:  ""It's a drastic change in tone. Before this, there was a very hands-off approach in Canada. I do think that Canadian businesses should take pause.""  Cointrader maintained that the decision came despite its efforts to ensure its legal standing through strong AML and KYC compliance, and suggested it is prepared to move operations overseas should the government follow through on some of its more aggressive statements.  The news comes just one day after Cointrader announced it would power new ATMs to be installed in London and Singapore.  A relationship sours  Cointrader was particularly surprised by the news, given its near year-long relationship with Bank of Montreal.  Szczesny said that not only had the relationship been positive, but that the bank had been using Cointrader as a template for how it could work with other bitcoin businesses.  Speaking about the partnership, Szczesny said:  ""We'd developed quite a strong relationship. We'd had the brand manager come down to our physical location to see what we're doing.""  Szczesny further suggested that he believes the timing of the move, which followed unfavorable comments from Canada's finance minister, indicates the country's financial institutions will become more cautious in their dealings with bitcoin businesses given the recent hostile rhetoric.  Assessing the impact  Despite Cointrader's sweeping warnings for Canadian bitcoin businesses, other members of Canada's bitcoin ecosystem remained unconcerned about the viability of their banking relationships.  Mike Curry, CEO of the Toronto-based exchange Vault of Satoshi, suggested that the decision was likely an isolated incident.  ""I think when it comes to banks, they deal on a one-on-one basis,"" he said.  Further, Curry stated that Cointrader was unlikely to receive any formal reasoning from Bank of Montreal as to why its decision was made. He also moved to downplay the idea that Canada is becoming increasingly hostile to bitcoin businesses, citing his own firm's relatively new relationship with Equifax.  ""We've been shut down by banks before and we've never known why. There was always a hint of cryptocurrency, but I think it's blown out of proportion.""  Similarly, virtual currency exchange Virtex suggested that its service has not been adversely affected by statements from the government.    VirtEx continues to have good relations with its financial partners. VirtEx is not experiencing any issues w/ respect to service disruption.      — CaVirtex (@cavirtex) February 18, 2014    Next steps  Going forward, Cointrader said it has one month to find a replacement bank. Szczesny indicated it is exploring local options, and that it is talking to large credit unions and one private bank.  As for the exchange's day-to-day operations, Cointrader moved to assure its online trading platform would not be affected.  ""We've already been expanding overseas. We plan on having bank accounts in other jurisdictions. The only real question right now is a convenient funding option in Canada,"" Szczesny said.  Still, Cointrader indicated that Canada's worsening bitcoin regulatory climate, as well as its decision to introduce a state-backed virtual currency, is forcing it to consider relocating its headquarters abroad.  Said the company:  ""If Canada continues it's negative stance, and chooses not to help this thriving economy grow in accordance with the law, then we will be forced to relocate to more forward-thinking economies which are able to encourage innovation while also effectively deterring criminal behaviour.""

42425452,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2OHh,1392753838,PassportParking First to Bring Bitcoin Payments to Parking Meters,"North Carolina-based cloud parking solutions provider PassportParking has announced that it will now allow parking operators to accept bitcoin payments for purchases.  PassportParking  said that in doing so it will be the first company to facilitate bitcoin acceptance in exchange for parking at metered spaces and lots. The company serves 75 clients in 35 states, who now have the option to enroll in the service.  Speaking about the news, PassportParking suggested the program would appeal to privacy-focused drivers, as well as its existing merchant base.  Explained PassportParking:    ""Paying with bitcoins allows privacy-conscious customers to have the same form of 'identity-less' payments that they would have with coins or cash.      The move also benefits parking operators with near-zero merchant processing fees, increasing revenues without an additional cost for the parking customer.""    Notably, Payward Inc., the company behind Kraken, and BitPay will process the payments.  Payward COO Michael Gronager, positioned the partnership as a way for its service to help PassportParking keep up with taxi operators, who are increasingly offering customers convenient, mobile payment solutions through providers like Square.  About the trial  PassportParking said one of the first parking operators to launch the program will be Park Charlotte, a major parking operator in Charlotte, North Carolina, a southern US city with a population of about 3 million. Notably, the company provides parking services near area attractions such as Bank of America Stadium (home of the Carolina Panthers NFL franchise), as well as the Charlotte Art Institute.  Park Charlotte said the testing would begin in 2014, but did not provide an exact date as to when service would begin.  Ross Brewer, CEO of Park Charlotte, indicated that he expects bitcoin be smart business for other lot operators as well, given the cost savings he believes it will provide.  Said Brewer:  “By allowing us to accept payment directly from our customer, without the need for a middleman, is a win-win situation for us and our customers.”  How PassportParking works  Available via the Android and iOS app stores, the PassportParking app allows consumers to pay for metered parking spots using its pay-by-text, pay-by-voice and mobile app services, which provide an alternative to traditional coin-operated meters.  Users do not need a smartphone to enroll in the company's basic offering, though the company did not specify if this would change for bitcoin users.  To begin, mobile app users enter information provided on the meters to identify the space they've selected, then choose the amount of time for which they want to book the space.  App users can later extend their parking period via the app.  Mobile parking payments  Parking has long been seen as a use case more broadly for mobile payments. As such, it's no surprise that PassportParking has previously explored other avenues of increasing this adoption. (PassportParking partnered with mobile carrier billing specialist Boku in October.)  Though, this is the first partnership in the bitcoin space, data suggests parking, like other services that thrive on micropayments, could soon become a powerful use case for bitcoin.  A recent report from the International Parking Institute found that 54% of parking industry executives expect mobile payment services to have the greatest affect on the industry in the coming years.

42422939,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymxh,1392751344,Ben Lawsky: Friend or Foe?,"It would be generous to say that Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), is viewed by the bitcoin community with some skepticism.  The man who has championed ‘BitLicenses’ – bitcoin-specific versions of money transmitter licenses for New York State – has developed a reputation within the fledgling industry as someone who is, at best, ‘not bad’.  Yet, for a regulator navigating the waters of an industry with libertarian and anarcho-capitalist zealots at its core, that borders on near god-like status.  While there are still many who dismiss his authority and believe that conciliatory conversations with regulators go against the very vision of Satoshi Nakamoto’s bitcoin, others seem hopeful that he will be a bitcoin ally, while most seem to have at least suspended their judgments of the superintendent.  — BitcoinBreak (@BitcoinBreak) January 28, 2014  Lawsky has earned that respect through his measured words and cautious actions towards bitcoin to date, and many are rooting for him to ultimately take a light-handed approach towards regulation of the cryptocurrency. Indeed, there is reason for cautious optimism.  A brief look at Ben Lawsky's background paints a fairly clear picture: He is no enemy.  Idealist and populist  Ben Lawsky comes across as both level-headed everyman and optimistic populist, both in person and on paper. He has tweeted pictures of beer and lasagna, references to his hometown sports teams, the Knicks and the Yankees, and even one gem, in which he said it was ok to watch Love Actually 25 times.  — Ben Lawsky (@BenLawsky) February 18, 2014  He promoted an informal atmosphere at the recent BitLicense hearings in New York, and at a recent event in Washington, DC, he joked about dogecoin, an alt-currency unfamiliar to most people outside of the bitcoin fraternity. I have personally had brief, but pleasant, conversations with him.  He is, by all accounts, a good guy.  Lawsky is also a career public servant. He started his career as a trial attorney for the Department of Justice and was quickly promoted to Chief Counsel to New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Then, after a five-year stint as a New York City prosecutor, he joined forces with Andrew Cuomo, where he became Special Assistant to the then-Attorney General, and later, Chief of Staff to the new Governor of New York during his campaign and early term.  For those unfamiliar with New York politics, Schumer and Cuomo are populist Democrats, and it is safe to say that the broader banking industry doesn’t exactly love them. Still, Lawsky has said publicly that he strives to live up to the “model that Andrew Cuomo set”.  No Wall Street crony  Lawsky is by no means an impotent state regulator. The NYDFS is a recent construct – a 2011 combination of the New York State Banking and Insurance Departments. As superintendent, Lawsky supervises all New York-based insurance companies, chartered banks and mortgage providers, who collectively manage over $6tn in assets.  Governor Cuomo hand-picked Lawsky as the first superintendent of the NYDFS, and charged him with modernizing the financial regulator and using his clout to protect consumers and squelch white collar criminal activities at some of New York’s biggest financial institutions.  Lawksy has embraced the role, posting a solid record that includes a $340m settlement with Standard Chartered and Deloitte, related to money laundering operations with Iran. And he has not shied away from investigations into hot-button areas, like payday loans, mortgage services and public pension solicitations.  That bold approach has won him respect, but also resentment from other federal regulators, according to an in-depth piece on Lawsky by Village Voice contributor Anna Merlan.  Michael Greenberger, a former regulator with the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, claimed that Lawsky was “making the federal government look like they don’t know what they’re doing”. While Art Wilmarth, a law professor and regulatory expert at George Washington University, suggested that Lawsky’s best efforts could embarrass his federal colleagues to the extent that they would be forced to “fall in line”.  Indeed, Lawsky's department levied a $250m fine on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi for money laundering just months after the Treasury Department had extracted a paltry $8.5m settlement in its own case.  Ben Lawsky is a state regulator making national news. He has all the markings of a man with much larger political ambitions.  Political animal  For a political figure, Lawsky’s 17-year resume reads like one out of central casting. Neither he nor his wife, Jessica Roth, have spent much time cashing in their law degrees from Columbia (where he graduated cum laude), or Harvard (where she graduated magna cum laude). Instead, both have been public prosecutors and public-sector employees since they graduated, forgoing the high-paying private sector jobs that were surely available to them.  For most career political figures like Lawsky, relatively meager salaries are a small price to pay in order to move up the executive ranks. However, the pay cut only makes sense if his political capital is rising.  Lawsky has firmly established himself as a fearless regulator willing to confront much larger institutions with or without the help and blessing of the federal government. While that sheriff mentality is usually helpful for politicians, it also serves to reinforce voters’ ‘big government’ image when it comes to regulators.  More than anything, it strikes me that Lawsky could really use a good story about job creation, innovation and systematic consumer empowerment in an era of ‘too-big-to-fail’ banking monoliths. And that’s where bitcoin comes in.  Much to gain  The virtual-currency industry presents Lawsky with a rare chance to promote rather than restrict, and to create rather than destroy. Bitcoin is Lawsky’s political trump card.  While he stands to win little by attaching his name to BitLicense regulations that push innovations offshore, a light touch could allow him to one day take credit for fostering a potential multitrillion-dollar industry.  Lawsky has recognized bitcoin’s ability to reduce remittance costs for multinational families, and its potential to attract droves of new startups building bitcoin exchanges, investment platforms and myriad other financial technologies to the US and, in particular, New York City.  He has gone out of his way to engage the bitcoin community, calling for ‘open source’ regulation and solicited feedback from Twitter, the blogosphere and in the coming days, it appears, the vocal reddit community.  Even amidst last week’s tumult with Mt. Gox and the widespread transaction malleability attack, Lawsky was characteristically reserved. He avoided criticism of both bitcoin, the Bitcoin Protocol and the compromised exchanges, and instead suggested this was evidence that it was important to bring exchanges to New York so “we could get better insight into what exactly they’re doing”.  Lawsky caught flak during the BitLicense hearings for supposedly prioritizing money laundering restrictions over promotion of new economic development with bitcoin, but the caricatures of his willingness to squelch “1,000 flowers” in order to completely eliminate narco-trafficking were simply not true.  Instead, mere blocks away from the World Trade Center, Lawsky was talking about squelching the funding of terrorism and rogue nations:  The choice for the regulators is: permit money laundering on the one hand, or permit innovation on the other, and we’re always going to choose squelching the money laundering first. It’s not worth it to society to allow money laundering and all of the things it facilitates to persist in order to permit 1000 flowers to bloom on the innovation side.”  In the proper context, Lawksy sounds neither shrill nor unreasonable. He is right to be cautious when it comes to weeding out the good actors from the bad within bitcoin, as it is the only way that the currency and maybe even the technology stands a chance.  He knows that there are local ramifications to his department’s ultimate regulations, but more importantly, he knows that BitLicenses will set the standard nationally when it comes to reforming our antiquated money transmitter laws.  Look at Ben Lawsky’s background. Look at his potential as a political figure. Then, look at his opportunity with Bitcoin. Does it seem reasonable that he would burn his golden ticket?

42425469,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2Oph,1392746715,"Bitcoin's Recent Price Plunge Could Have Been Worse, Wedbush Finds","A new report released by Wedbush Securities on 14th February has found that bitcoin's most recent price decline in the wake of ongoing operational issues at major bitcoin exchanges is actually a sign that the ecosystem is stabilizing.  Entitled 'Bitcoin: Watch the Innovation, Not the Price', the 16-page report suggests that six months ago, the consequences of such instability would have been far worse for the industry.  Wedbush explained:  ""As a sign of price stabilization we would point out that Bitcoin has declined less than 15% in the face of its biggest and oldest exchange being crippled and other key exchanges coming under a broad denial of service attack.""  Wedbush went on to state that newer exchanges such as those operated by Kraken and Buttercoin ""will be better equipped to prevent assaults based on transaction malleability"".  The resulting stability, the report reasoned, should do much to continue to inspire more merchants, entrepreneurs and bitcoin users to get involved in the burgeoning industry.  The news comes just days after Wedbush announced it would begin accepting bitcoin for its reports. 'Bitcoin: Watch the Innovation, Not the Price' is available in full via Wedbush's website for 0.1 BTC.  Entrepreneur interest  Wedbush suggested heightened interest from investors will further improve not just bitcoin, but the entire digital currency ecosystem. As such, the report cautioned its readers not to be too skeptical of even some of the more ""whimsical"" market opportunities like dogecoin and RonPaulCoin.  The company stated:  ""Keep in mind, Snapchat looked whimsical all the way to a $3 billion valuation.""  Wedbush also included materials meant to compare bitcoin's volatility to that of other notable startups, including high-growth equities such as Facebook, Twitter and Tesla Motors.  User interest  The report provided evidence of what Wedbush called the ""incredible growth"" being observed in the ecosystem. Researchers suggested that they see this increase in bitcoin's user base as a sign the industry is moving ""toward the widespread adoption"".  In particular, Wedbush cited the rising interest in bitcoin wallets from providers such as Coinbase and Blockchain.info, the latter of which recently passed 1 million wallets.  Likewise, it noted Coinbase has already added more than 200,000 users to date this year.  Merchant interest  Wedbush also suggested that bitcoin is making strides toward mainstream adoption through ""large retailers and content creators"" such as Overstock and Zynga.  Merchant acquirers like BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin are playing an integral role in this process, it continued, by limiting the risk of these new users and allowing them to experience only the gain.  In particular, Wedbush estimated Overstock's decision to accept bitcoin could increase its GAAP net income by as much as 2%, as it was able to profit from initial bitcoin spending without the risk, though it has said it may now keep some bitcoin reserves.  ""We believe these early use cases will lead to other large merchants getting comfortable accepting bitcoin,"" the report concluded.

42425470,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2Orh,1392741251,What it Takes to Design the Next Big Thing in Mining Hardware,"So you think it’s difficult to keep up with the breakneck pace of cryptocurrency mining from your home PC? Imagine what it’s like being in the business of building the next generation of bitcoin miners, when difficulty increases exponentially, chip R&D seems painfully slow, and customers constantly want more bang for their buck.  That’s what Kansas City-based Butterfly Labs has to contend with on an ongoing basis. Once a product is complete, you can’t sit around and enjoy your accomplishment, it’s time to move on to the next one.  “By the time you get a product flowing smoothly, it’s already at the end of its life,” explained Josh Zerlan, product development VP at Butterfly Labs.  “From when we start writing down the specs of the new product to when it is done and we’re no longer selling, it’s a six-month timeframe. And that’s completely unheard of [in product development],"" he said.  Data centres beckon  Butterfly Labs has been the subject of a fair bit of negative criticism, with some extremely unhappy customers. Zerlan claims this is all part and parcel of the competitive industry BFL exists in.  He said one of the company’s product issues has come from a problem sourcing power supplies.  “I actually ran our RMA [return merchandise authorization] numbers a couple of weeks ago and it was about a 1.22% failure rate. And the majority of those are due to the power supplies. We’ve been trying to address it, and get higher quality PSUs,” Zerlan said.  The company has long believed that bitcoin mining would eventually move into the data centres, rather than being based in small localized operations. That way, IT professionals can make their own choices about power supplies or other aspects of their setup.  For this reason, the company’s new 28nm Monarch miner will slot into a rack like a blade server.  “That’s one of the reasons we went the Monarch route, where we’re not going to provide the power supply anymore,” Zerlan explained.  The new card is capable of different configurations – as a chained USB peripheral, for example.  “Because there are so many varied installations, people have different requirements. One power supply doesn’t necessarily work for everybody. It's much easier to just leave it up to the customer to [customize] their own installation,” he said.  Keeping cool  The Monarch has been designed for larger-scale applications, rather than home setups, said Zerlan.  “It’s more of an add-on card, intended to go into a data centre, in an industrial-scale application. It’s for people who are going to pack it in in high densities – especially the water cooled version.”  As Zerlan suggests, there will be two models of the Monarch: one will be a covered water block, the other is air-cooled.  “[Water-cooled models] require a little more maintenance, but with our closed loop system, the solution will be pretty much maintenance-free,” said Zerlan.  “You will have to find somewhere to put the radiator. It’s a little more complicated than air-cooled, but you get much better performance because water carries heat far more effectively than air.”  Retail routes  Butterfly Labs’ main competitors are currently KnCMiner, HashFast and CoinTerra. Unlike those companies, however, BFL is going retail. It already sells units via TigerDirect, something the company set up just a few weeks ago. “We are negotiating with several other retail channels too,” Zerlan said.  The company displayed its products at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, with retailers showing keen interest.  Setting pricing and designing an attractive package has been challenging for BFL. Supporting end-users and creating retail-oriented packaging is “actually a huge undertaking”, Zerlan said. “We’ve been having to scramble to figure out how to make it work”.  However, BFL is determined to sell at the retail level and now has the staff and logistical expertise to bring this about. “We are in good position to deliver to these (retail) companies, but they don’t want one or two units – they want hundreds,” Zerlan said.  The next node  To speak of a ‘node’ in bitcoin mining is to refer to the size of the ASIC chip used. BFL came to market with 65nm-node miners. Its next generation will be down to 28nm. The one after that is likely to be 14nm.  “Right now Intel is working on 14nm. We’ll probably move to that at some point,” Zerlan said.  “People are now starting to experiment with 10nm. Once we move to 14nm, there will be a 12-month break in the cycle of constant upgrades waiting for [development of the] 10nm,” he said.  “When we go to 10nm, we’ll be up against Moore’s Law at that point. We’ll have to wait like everybody else for the next generation of technology to be available – probably another 18 to 24 months.”  The smaller the chip, the more efficient it becomes, although the returns do diminish when shifting to smaller nodes.  “Running the numbers, I think what we’re going to see is 28nm being the most cost-effective node level. As you jump down to 14nm, your gains are much less, but your costs increase dramatically,” said Zerlan  “So it’s actually cheaper to build a 28nm and just build more of them, than it is to build a 14nm. I think 28nm is going to have a lot more life that people think it will,"" he said.  Different configurations of 28nm nodes could also be used to squeeze out more power: more chips to a board, say, or a greater chip surface area.  Digital gold rush  The bitcoin price spike that happened near the end of 2013 created an increased fervour for mining the digital currency. When asked what might happen in the mining industry if bitcoin should ever hit $5,000 per coin, Zerlan said he believes interest would rise dramatically.  “They are going to be like ‘I don’t care what it is, as long as its hashing, I’m going to buy it’,” he said.  “That’s what happened with our 65nm (products): the price blew up and we went from expecting 3,000 to 4,000 orders in total over the life of the entire product to 50,000.”  If the price of bitcoin does hit $5,000, the same increase in demand is likely to happen again. For BFL, having retail channels in place means that the company still believes in the future of consumer-based BTC mining.  There will always be a place for the consumer mining market, Zerlan thinks:  “The trick is going to be pricing the devices within reach of individuals. That’s why we’ve partnered with NimbusMiner. We can offer something to the consumer that doesn’t have $5,000 to spend, but has a couple hundred.”  What Zerlan is referring to is the replacement for the consumer-oriented Jalapeno miner. The NimbusMining concept is an upcoming device that allows mining enthusiasts to have fun with being a part of the bitcoin ecosystem.  “It’s basically cloud hashing. It is an interface to that,” Zerlan explained. “You can buy anywhere from 1 GH/sec up to the TH/sec level if you want. You can set it on your desk[top], it doesn’t use a whole lot of power, doesn’t make any noise, and you can watch what’s going on."" He summed up:  “You’re mining, but you don’t have the loud, noisy, obnoxious miners.”  That statement could sum up the future of bitcoin mining for most people. In the end, the hardware race may mostly run in the data centre. At the same time, hashing will be through cloud-based devices, keeping individuals involved at the consumer level.

42425462,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI2Odh,1392737997,DIY Dogecoin ATM Demos at CoinFest Vancouver,"The world’s first dogecoin ATM has been launched in Vancouver, and it looks about as serious as the dogecoin logo.  The machine consists of a Nexus 7 tablet attatched to a briefcase, along with a money validator.  Needless to say, this isn't exactly a bona fide ATM and nor is it supposed to be. It was created to spice up the two-day CoinFest digital currency festival in Vancouver.  The ATM have one redeeming feature – it features a lot of Comic Sans. However, this isn't good news for everyone. As the saying goes, every time you use Comic Sans, somewhere in the world a designer dies.  Such Doge, much ATM  Joking aside, the contraption is fully functional and it illustrates what can be done with a bit of ingenuity on a very tight budget. In other words, it works like a real crypto ATM, but it does not let users send coins, just buy them.  It probably wouldn’t be a good idea to actually install it in a public space, either – the carrying handle is still attached.  Using the ATM is relatively simple. Users simply need to press “Doge” on the tablet, scan a QR code containing the address, insert cash and hit “To the Moon”. A few moments later dogecoins will be transferred to the users’ digital wallet.  The Nexus 7 may not be the best choice for this sort of device, as its front-facing camera isn’t very impressive, but then again it runs vanilla Android straight from Google, which tends to make it a bit more stable than many Android tablets.  Is there a market for it?  Of course not – there is no market for dogecoin ATMs and there probably never will be. However, the fact that it is possible to make a functional ATM with a bit of glue and outdated consumer electronics is news in itself.  The openness of dogecoin and the casual approach taken by most dogecoin supporters is an interesting phenomenon, and is encouraging for the world of cryptocurrencies in general. According to Straight.com’s Stephen Hui, the ATM wasn’t working when he tried to convert a few bucks into dogecoins.  Still, it is the thought that counts, especially in the meme-loving world of dogecoin. Wow.

42425445,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rTh,1392732450,LocalBitcoins Starts Manufacturing Low-Cost Bitcoin ATM,"Bitcoin marketplace LocalBitcoins.com has produced a bitcoin ATM and is preparing to mass-manufacture the machine, which was launched on 17th February.  The Helsinki-based company said the machine can perform two-way conversions between bitcoin and fiat currency. Each unit is priced at €1,990 (approx $2,732) and the firm has built five so far.  LocalBitcoins founder Jeremias Kangas said:  “We have a pretty good chance of entering [the ATM market]. Of course there are existing companies but our model is much more cost-effective.”  The LocalBitcoins machine will also obtain its conversion rates differently from existing two-way machines. A Robocoin ATM, for example, takes its rates from a large exchange like Bitstamp through an internet connection.  The ATM can operate offline, and transactions must be completed through the LocalBitcoins website.    Customers buying bitcoin through the ATM, for example, would deposit cash in the machine and receive a redeemable code. The customer would then enter this code on LocalBitcoins.com to complete the transaction.      Customers selling bitcoin would transfer coins into a LocalBitcoins wallet and specify the amount of fiat currency they wish to withdraw. This would then generate a redeemable code which can be inputted into the ATM – the machine would then produce the cash.    Transaction fees    LocalBitcoins will charge a 1% transaction fee for using the ATM. This fee would be on top of the premium on conversions set by the ATM's operator. Kangas said he expected the machines to be a hit among active LocalBitcoin traders:    “[LocalBitcoins.com] is already a world-leading website for finding [bitcoin to cash] exchangers, so an ATM makes sense. We can distribute ATMs to our traders. Many will be interested. We have traders in at least 150 countries.”  Kangas said the first batch of machines are designed to be used with an attendant monitoring them. Currently, they do not have any customer identification features, he added.  A blogpost on the LocalBitcoins website announcing the machines called the units “experimental” and offered a full refund if customers found any technical problems.  What's next?  LocalBitcoins is planning to develop two types of machines, one priced at €1,500 to €2,000 and a more advanced model at €2,500 to €3,000, according to Kangas.  The machines can accept more than 100 currencies. They also contain a bank-note recycler, which reduces the need for the operator to monitor and top-up the amount of cash in the machine.  Although the company has not sold any units yet, it confirmed that it has received various inquiries. Kangas said he expected the first machine to be acquired and installed within a month.  Earlier this month Florida police arrested a LocalBitcoins user in a sting operation where an undercover agent attempted to convert $30,000 into bitcoin. Police said the user flouted Florida's anti-money laundering laws. Kangas said his firm had not formulated a response to these scenarios yet. He said:  ""We are thinking about what to do with the situation, how to deal with this kind of activity in the future.""  The ATM space is evolving quickly as operators begin to move upstream with their own exchanges, as in the case of Vancouver’s Bitcoiniacs, while marketplace owners like LocalBitcoins begin manufacturing operations.

42425435,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1r9h,1392727238,First US Bitcoin ATMs Coming to Seattle and Austin,"Seattle and Austin will soon become the first US cities with bitcoin ATMs, provided everything goes according to plan.  The machines are coming from ATM manufacturer Robocoin and the company claims they will be installed by the end of the month, Reuters reports.  Robocoin ATMs are more elaborate than their Lamassu counterparts. They are cash-only machines and they have a few additional security features, such as biometric and optical scanners.  In theory, this should allow much higher levels of security than regular ATMs. The barcode scanner can be used to scan QR codes and transfer bitcoins to your mobile. The ATMs can also scan government issued IDs, including driver’s licences.  First in the US  Robocoin ATMs have been deployed in several markets, including Canada. However, in other parts of the world deployment has proved problematic. Robocoin was supposed to install ATMs in Taiwan and Hong Kong, but Taiwanese authorities quickly moved to block the deployment of machines to the island nation.  This should not be the case in Austin or Seattle, but there is still a lot of regulatory ambiguity. It all boils down to how the authorities choose to classify the Robocoin contraptions; they can view them as kiosks, ATMs or even vending machines that dispense a commodity in the form of bitcoins.  Singapore and London  In related news, Bitcoiniacs are planning to install Robocoin ATMs in both London and Singapore by mid-March. London is currently witnessing three different bitcoin startups racing to install the city's first bitcoin ATM.  Singapore was chosen by Bitcoiniacs due to its relatively clear rules on bitcoin taxation, and of course the city’s trend setting image in much of Asia. As a major regional financial hub, Singapore remains the logical choice for good PR.

42422930,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymdh,1392723538,The Rise of the Cryptocurrency Gift Economy,"In 2013, the digital anthropologist Lui Smyth conducted a survey of the most common uses of bitcoin.  He found bitcoin was used to buy web services, software, hardware, gambling services, and (in the heyday of the Silk Road) narcotics. Topping the list though, when measured in terms of the number of transactions, was tipping and donations.  The public block chain provides much anecdotal evidence for this. All one needs to do is search the tipping addresses of people or groups who openly advertise that they take bitcoin tips.  Here, for example, are tipping accounts for Adam B Levine and Stephanie Murphy of the popular Let’s Talk Bitcoin show. Libertarian activist Adam Kokesh has received a significant number of donations via his Youtube channel. And here is Wikileaks, the open-source software producer VideoLAN, and the anarchist magazine Strike!.  I have even received one bitcoin tip and a few dogecoin tips for my own blog (indeed, the dogecoin community appears to have a particularly generous heart when it comes to supporting underdogs like the Jamaican Bobsleigh team). This donation culture has also taken off in forums like reddit, where tools like BitcoinTip allow redditors to send each other tokens of appreciation for thoughtful comments.  This use of cryptocurrency for small acts of generosity may seem unusual to those who associate bitcoin with self-interested profit-seeking speculation, but it points to the emergence of a promising cryptocurrency gift economy.  What is a gift economy?  The best way to illustrate a gift economy transaction is to think about a street busker who sets up on the sidewalk and proceeds to give something to society.  The busker does not expect anything back from any particular person who walks past, but the fact that they leave a hat out for tips shows that they hope that in general some people will be inspired to give back to them.  In 2001 I experienced this first hand when I busked on the New York subway. It differs from normal economic exchange, where a service is offered only to a particular person who completes the transaction with a particular payment.  It also differs from a pure gift, where we hand something over to a particular person without expecting anything back. In busking, a service is freely given to many but voluntarily paid for by only some.  At its heart then, such exchange relies on a different notion of the economic individual, not one who acts in their narrow self-interest, but one who is motivated to act even when they do not have to. It has much in common with the Buddhist notion of Karma – I give something and have faith that it will come back.  Why cryptocurrencies suit online gift economies  So why might cryptocurrencies be ideal for online donations and tipping?  Firstly, they are easy to use. Bloggers engage in the Internet version of busking when they request donations for pieces they write. If I enjoy a blog post though, I do not want to have to enter into a complicated process to donate to the writer. I need the digital equivalent of flipping someone a coin as I walk past them, and cryptocurrency is ideal for that.  There is also something very personal about choosing to give money to an online busker when you are not contractually obliged to do so, and this type of transaction does not lend itself to formal third-party payment providers. Bloggers frequently do set up Paypal donate buttons on their sites, but the third-party adds a layer of formality to something that is intrinsically informal.  Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, have a naturally informal feel to them, a bit like loose change in your pocket. Their anonymous nature adds to this. When you send a Paypal donation, your identity becomes known to the person receiving it. As the transaction becomes formally recorded, the act can become more contrived, like when a wealthy person donates to a public building to get their name plastered on it.  Hiding identity can be associated with a lack of trust, but equally it can stand for the removal of ego from a transaction. When I tip a street busker it is very fleeting, and the busker will seldom know who I am.  In a sense, I stand for a general person in society who appreciates them. Anonymous cryptocurrency donations are similar. They do not aggrandize the tipper, and can be used to express a pure appreciation for the services provided.  Preserving the soul of bitcoin  This emergent gift economy should be actively encouraged by all those interested in the future of cryptocurrency, and here is why.  Bitcoin initially had the feel of a true underdog currency, an unlikely adventure undertaken by outsider enthusiasts. I often work with NGOs and humanitarian groups, and when bitcoin initially came out there was real curiosity about whether the technology had the potential for helping vulnerable people.  As bitcoin’s fame has risen though, and with it the triumphalist stories of bitcoin millionaires, the tone has shifted. Far from being perceived as a currency of empowerment, it risks becoming seen as just another technology for elites to get rich off, especially as the costs of mining skyrocket. The air-conditioned Silicon Valley conferences seem a million miles away from the gritty reality of much of the rest of the world.  Recently Andreas Antonopolous urged bitcoin enthusiasts to tone down the rhetoric of speculation and to focus on bitcoin’s potential role in facilitating charity. And as Andrea Castillo writes, new approaches to welfare that go beyond the traditional left vs right battles are needed.  Participating in, and encouraging a thriving informal gift economy could be a chance for crypto enthusiasts to showcase how an economy based on decentralised voluntary association could also support those who are on the fringes of society.

42425451,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rbh,1392716557,The Banking Industry's Varied Views on Bitcoin,"Decentralized, math-based currencies can provide a framework for autonomous banking. To the average person that may not mean much, but to some the concept is enthralling.  Controlling money outside of incumbent systems is particularly exciting to cyberpunks and crypto-libertarians, yet the banks will, at some point, be working closely with bitcoin. A future where cryptocurrencies are a mainstream financial technology will likely depend on it.  Here are three different banks, with very different stances on bitcoin, that reveal just how contrasting the financial industry can be.  JP Morgan  The investment bank JP Morgan stands on the other side of the fence in regards to bitcoin. Recently that company released a report called “The Audacity of Bitcoin”.  From the title itself, it is not difficult to surmise what the organization thinks about the cryptocurrency. John Normand, the paper’s author, writes:  “As a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value, it is vastly inferior to fiat currencies.”  Its advocates would say, of course, that bitcoin is still new, that it has room for growth as a digital payment mechanism and that every new idea faces a period of early adoption before heading into the mainstream.  Indeed, bitcoin is not as mature as the existing fiat financial system and weaknesses have exposed, especially recently. Yet it should be noted that innovation in bitcoin is moving forwards, and not backwards.  “If bitcoin stopped growing and changing, it would not have a real shot at becoming a widely used international currency,” says Andy Beal, who is an attorney with Crowley Strategy and helps advise early-stage companies.  The startup arena is currently seeing more new companies built around bitcoin – along with an increase in venture capital flowing into the ecosystem. Beal says:    “Unfortunately for JP Morgan, growth won’t stop. The bitcoin community and infrastructure will continue to get stronger and safer.”          Wells Fargo  In January, the San Francisco-based bank Wells Fargo held a private meeting dubbed ‘Virtual Currency: Viability, Compliance and Direction’. The event, held in New York City, was at the offices of Union Square Ventures.  The venture capital firm has invested in bitcoin over the last year, providing funding for Coinbase in several different rounds: one led by the firm last May, and then the latest $25m influx of cash led by Andreessen Horowitz.  Union Square’s Fred Wilson recently wrote an article for CoinDesk. “I don’t have a problem with regulation per se, but how and when it happens matters a lot,” he wrote.  Wells Fargo appears to be interested in being an innovator in cryptocurrencies, but, as the title of its summit suggests, it has concerns about future regulation in the United States.  There is still potential for Wells Fargo to be one of the biggest banks to first embrace bitcoin, however.  Protected wallets are one service, for example, that could see banks succeed within the cryptocurrency realm.  Josh Siems is the founder and developer behind TrustedCoin – a company that provides third-party secure storage for bitcoin. He thinks it is likely that banks will soon join the bitcoin economy:  “In the future, I think we’re going to see banks like Wells Fargo offering bitcoin storage.”  Fred Wilson’s comment is revealing, however. At the moment, Wells Fargo wants more compliance guidance before it will enter the fray.  Silicon Valley Bank  The Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), based in Santa Clara, California, is an early synergist within bitcoin and banking. The company’s relationship with Coinbase allows US bank holders to easily acquire bitcoin. Verify a bank account with Coinbase, and it’s simple to move your USD into bitcoin and vice versa.  Right now the bank is actively involved with bitcoin business, but not proving storage services. Instead, the bank’s role appears to be as an ACH wire transfer provider.  “They’re not really storing [bitcoin] or anything. They are just basically getting comfortable having a relationship with a bitcoin company,” Siems said.  However, he sees SVB’s position as a banking innovator as a significant part of what makes it so successful. “They are branding themselves as the go-to bank for the whole investor community of the Bay Area,” he said.  The bank is taking a risk by working with bitcoin, but doing so will give it singular expertise on how to work within today’s unclear regulatory environment.  Fraud is one problem with cryptocurrencies, something that SVB is having to learn about.  “It’s really hard when you try to facilitate the exchange between two forms of money – one of which is reversible, and one of which isn’t,” said Siems  That is a challenge that the entrepreneurial SVB appears willing to take on, however.  Banking actions  Each of the banking entities above reveals a totally different mind-set concerning bitcoin business, and each for its own good reasons.  Banks, as enterprises, must align the emergence of cryptocurrencies to their business strategy, which is why bitcoin is seen through a prism that suits each institution’s future prospects.  It’s important for the bitcoin world to be aware of what the financial corporations do with virtual currencies going forward.  “As bitcoin continues to grow and more people use it in the future, it is inevitable that the banks are going to want to have ownership on the larger parts of that,” said Siems.  Bank of America’s positive report on bitcoin backs up that statement. And we can expect to see more of these analyses of virtual currencies published by the banks – they are an easy way for financial institutions to gauge the sentiments of both their customers and the public.  Furthermore, such reports show that a particular bank is at least paying attention, even if it doesn’t quite know what to do with these novel cryptocurrencies within existing monetary systems.

42425449,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rZh,1392686481,CoinTerra to Release GSX I Water-Cooled PCIe Bitcoin Mining Card,"Austin, Texas-based CoinTerra has announced its second product.  Called the GSX I, the card form factor bitcoin miner uses water for cooling, and notably, has a radiator serving as a heat exchange for the water, piping it over the board. The GSX I is a 400 GH/s unit that has a 28nm chip.  Jim O’Connor, vice president of engineering for CoinTerra, spoke to CoinDesk about the upcoming launch, and said he believes using water is the best method of cooling for a card.  Said O'Connor:    “With the PCIe form factor and space constraints of a PC case, there simply is no other solution that is able to dissipate heat effectively enough.      Mounting any form of air cooling head on the ASIC would make it impossible to fit the card in any standard motherboard and not take up more than two PCIe slots""    Product testing  O’Conner believes that the card will allow for increased mining flexibility.  “The GSX I is designed to facilitate daisy chaining via USB using a PC host, but we will ultimately leave it up to the community to experiment with their own flavors of controller,” he said.  CoinTerra stated that, through testing, it has found that a single BeagleBoard host could control at least 20 cards.  “Our simulations show that a single BeagleBone Black should be able to provide work to a large number of GSX I cards,” said O’Connor.  A BeagleBone Black is a $45 device powered by a 1 GHz ARM Cortex-A8.  Increased competition  CoinTerra isn’t the only mining company developing water-cooled PCI cards.  Kansas City-based Butterfly Labs also has a similar product on the way. Called the Monarch, that unit is a 600 GH/s 350 watt card for $2,196. By comparison, the GSX I consumes 400 watts of power and costs $1,599.  The Monarch is expected to start shipping this month. It will be available in air or water-cooled configurations.  Josh Zerlan, VP of product for Butterfly Labs, recently told CoinDesk that radiator mounting is one challenge for water board cooling.  O’Conner says that CoinTerra’s GSX I will fit within a standardized specification.  “The radiator is designed for easy mounting using standard 120mm fan mounts available in most standard PC cases,” he said.  Launch criticisms  CoinTerra plans to ship the GSX I by June. The company has received some criticism for not shipping its first product, the $5,999 2 TH/s TerraMiner, on time.  In a statement to CoinDesk last week, CoinTerra addressed the situation. The company wrote that units are being delivered, and that it is trying to ramp up operation.  “In addition to our initial production facility, we have brought a second, larger production facility online to increase volume substantially, allowing us to quickly catch up to our communicated delivery dates and meet future batch expectations.”  Preorders for the GSX I are open now. The scheduled date for shipments is June 2014.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/18/cointerra-to-release-gsx-i-water-cooled-pcie-bitcoin-mining-card,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0adcb15af4e11d09a52ec37cebf205dc90dc20dc-1347x752.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
