However, it's still down more than 50% YTD. Given the Fed's hawkish stance, can Block continue to gain operating leverage through 2023? With SQ's embedded growth premium, it's imperative for the company to regain its profitability growth to justify its valuation. Otherwise, more pain could lie ahead if a recession disproportionately impacts the company's SMB merchant and less affluent Gen Z consumer base. SQ Likely Bottomed In October 2022 Block, Inc. ( SQ ) has outperformed the market since our previous update in late October, suggesting that the market has likely priced in significant pessimism. We remain confident that SQ should continue consolidating constructively, with buyers confident in supporting its October lows, with its reward/risk more well-balanced after the recent recovery. Despite that, we remain confident that SQ's potential is still skewed toward the upside from the current levels, even though we expect some near-term volatility. The company's underlying Square (merchant) and Cash App (consumer) ecosystems demonstrated their resilience, as Q3 metrics surprised to the upside, despite worsening macros. Therefore, the company's strategy of developing an encompassing ecosystem away from Apple's ( AAPL ) and PayPal's ( PYPL ) is still on track, even though its profitability remains a work in progress. Despite that, the company has shown that it has constructive OpEx levers to pull to reduce its investments and focus on lifting its operating leverage through the cycle. Even though SQ's YTD total return of -56% could suggest significant damage has been inflicted, its valuation is still configured with a premium against its peers. As such, we believe the market needs Block to continue improving its profitability growth in 2023, corroborating its ability to gain share and grow adoption while improving its average revenue per user ((ARPU)). The Fed's Hawkish Stance Could Hamper Block's Progress However, it remains to be seen whether Block's recent improvement in its underlying segments could be sustained moving ahead. Moreover, the Fed is committed to keeping its terminal rate at 5.1% (median) for 2023 before considering cuts in 2024. As such, investors need to assess the potential for a deeper downturn in its seller ecosystem, which could be disproportionately impacted. Even though the company's Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) revenue growth has fallen significantly from its 2021's highs, it still accounted for 39% of its FQ3 revenue base, while its gross profits accounted for 2.3% of its gross profits on a corporate level. We assessed that the crypto winter has likely worsened the volatility seen in SQ over the past year. Therefore, investors need to be wary that the bad vibes in crypto could continue to be a drag against SQ's recovery moving ahead, even though its direct contribution is immaterial to the company's profitability. Despite that, the company sees Bitcoin adoption as a critical lever in its bid to topple the traditional payments technology companies. However, as we also discussed in our PayPal and Visa ( V ) articles ( here and here ), these companies possess significant competitive moats. In addition, Visa has demonstrated that its global omnichannel approach continues to proffer solid profitability, benefiting its cross-border revenue recovery. While Block has improved its ability to scale internationally, it faced macro and forex headwinds in 2022. But, its international revenue share of its total revenue of 7.1% in Q3 (up from Q2's 5.8%) suggests that Block's main growth driver remains in the US. SQ: Expensive Compared To Peers SQ's valuation is not cheap. It last traded at an NTM EBITDA multiple of 37.4x. With a projected adjusted EBITDA margin of just 5.2% for FY22, investors could consider it as its glass half full or half empty. Compared to its peers' median of 11.4x (according to S&P Cap IQ data), the market likely expects Block to continue lifting its operating leverage rapidly. As such, we gleaned several questions in its Q3 earnings commentary by Street analysts who were justifiably concerned whether the company's earnings growth trajectory could be impacted in FY23. Management's near-term outlook did not suggest that Block could face significant headwinds, but it was not yet ready to telegraph its FY23 guidance. With the Fed's monetary policy likely remaining firmly in the restrictive zone for FY23, we believe it could work against its Square ecosystem and less affluent Cash App customer base if a deeper recession were to occur. Coupled with its relatively expensive growth premium, we urge investors not to rule out ongoing volatility as the market assesses the impact of the Fed's hawkish stance in 2023. In the near term, we don't expect the market to expect Block to deliver robust profitability metrics as seen in PayPal's and Visa's business models. But, of course, that depends on whether Block could continue to deliver significant operating leverage gains. Block Gross margins by segment % (Company filings) Hence, we urge investors to watch its segment gross margins closely, particularly in its higher-margin subscriptions & services segment. It's imperative that its margins do not deteriorate further. Block Gross margins % and Adjusted EBITDA margins % consensus estimates (S&P Cap IQ) The Street expects Block's gross margins to continue its recovery through FY24. However, the Street has also gotten SQ's ratings wrong over the past year, as it fell steeply from its 2021 highs. Therefore, it's critical to apply a generous margin of safety on its estimates, given its embedded growth premium. Takeaway While we observed a strong recovery from its October lows, we urge investors to be cautious about expecting SQ to retake its August highs anytime soon. Retaking its August highs would imply an NTM EBITDA target multiple of nearly 50x. We believe such an aggressive valuation approach is risky. Therefore, investors should consider adding more exposure closer to its October levels and wait patiently for pullbacks to improve their reward/risk. Maintain Buy with a PT of $85, but we encourage investors to layer in over time.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4564808-block-profitable-growth-imperative-or-more-pain-likely?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5685328.jpeg

42388372,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREgMB,1671145455,First Mover Asia: Active Crypto Developers Decreased Nearly 60% in 2022,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and the CoinDesk Market Index turned lower as traders started to rethink the takeaway from this week's Federal Reserve meeting.  Insights: Ethereum had 192 active developers on Dec. 14, the highest number of developers among blockchain projects, data from Token Terminal suggests.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 866.48 −15.4 ▼ 1.7% Bitcoin (BTC) $17,408 −394.2 ▼ 2.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,270 −41.0 ▼ 3.1% S&P 500 daily close  3,895.75 −99.6 ▼ 2.5% Gold  $1,787 −20.6 ▼ 1.1% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.45% ▼ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto sentiment makes quick reversal  By Bradley Keoun  If Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting brought a buoyant mood to crypto markets, Thursday's action brought a reality check.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value was down 2.6% over the past 24 hours, to about $17,400, tracking a similar trajectory in U.S. stocks.  Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall, lost 3.6%, to $1,262. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) slid 2.4%. Optimism's OP token ranked among the biggest losers with a 10% decline.  The take of CoinDesk markets analyst Glenn Williams Jr. was that the Federal Reserve, while slowing the pace of interest-rate increases, still has a long way to go before it can end its campaign to wring out inflation. Before price rises can moderate, the Fed will have to see a pretty significant increase in unemployment – to keep expectations of higher wages from becoming entrenched. Hopes of a quick reversal by the Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues might be premature. Funding rates – a key barometer of sentiment in crypto derivatives markets – are still pointing negative.  Insights  By Sage D. Young  The number of daily active developers working on top blockchains and decentralized applications (dapps) has decreased roughly 57% this year, according to financial data platform Token Terminal.  In January, about 3,700 daily developers were active, compared to almost 1,600 on Dec. 14, data from Token Terminal suggests, which tracks daily totals.  The decline has come as ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, and other cryptocurrencies have plummeted from record highs little more than a year ago. ETH was recently trading at about $1,300, down 64% from the start of the year when the second largest crypto by market capitalization was still hovering near $4,000. The number of projects built on the Ethereum platform over this period has plummeted as some projects have failed and increasingly risk averse investors have deployed their money at a slower rate than during 2021’s bull market.  “It’s not surprising to see an overall decline in daily active devs,” said Chris Eberle, angel investor and contributor at Coordinape and PleasrDAO who goes by DeFi Ginger on Twitter. “2022 has been punch after punch for crypto. The impact to the market and the overall brand of crypto is just brutal.”  Eberle noted that this year’s crypto debacles, including the recent collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and failing of centralized lender Celsius Network, have created “one, big ball of pain” for the industry that has also contributed to the decline in active developers.  With 192 developers as of Dec. 14, Ethereum currently has the most daily developers among blockchain protocols and dapps. Cardano and Cosmos rank second and third with 144 and 143 active developers, respectively. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently has 18 active developers.  According to Token Terminal, Solana saw the largest reduction from roughly 2,500 devs in January to 75 developers at the time of publication, although the protocol insisted in a tweet last month that thousands of developers are working on the platform. “Something doesn’t add up, Eberle said. ""Solana fell off a cliff before [the FTX collapse].”  He added: ”Others seem to have some dip but it could well be seasonal as we’re in the holiday zone now.”  Token Terminal’s methodology to determine an “active developer” is based on the “number of distinct GitHub users that made 1+ commits to the project’s GitHub repositories during the past 30 days.”  Overall, the number of the active developers in the crypto space has stabilized between 1,500 and 1,600 since mid summer, suggesting that a core of the determined, adequately funded people remain convinced of blockchain technology’s potential.

These large investors have been rapidly buying up the tokens and increasing the percentage of supply they hold. In the last month, the holdings of these large whales have seen a significant uptick, sending their cumulative total holdings to one of the highest it has ever been. Gobbling Up The Coins Data from Santiment shows that the holdings of XRP whales with 100,000 to 10 million coins on their balances have jumped more than 6% in the last five weeks. These whales had held around 11% of the total XRP supply in mid-November following the crash of the FTX crypto exchange. But since then, they have increased their holdings by millions. Related Reading: What Ethereum’s Rejection At $1,350 Says About The Cryptocurrency Presently, the total percentage of supply held by these large whales is hovering around 18%. The chart below shows a clear uptrend in the last month where the holdings of these whales have increased, especially those holding between 1 million to 10 million coins. Whale holdings up in five weeks | Source: Santiment The same trend is also seen among wallets holding above 10 million coins. These wallets now hold a larger majority of the total supply at 71.67%, up from the 70.8% recorded in mid-November. So in total, addresses holding 100,000 coins and above now command around 90% of the total XRP supply. Will XRP Rally From Here? XRP’s price is currently moving in tandem with the crypto market which is still feeling the effects of Wednesday’s FOMC announcement. However, this clear accumulation trend among XRP whales could hint at a possible decoupling of the digital asset’s price from the broader crypto market, leading to a rally. XRP recovers above $0.38 | Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com With prices so low, a lot of investors are not looking to sell their coins, but rather are investing for the long term. If the available supply continues to go to investors who are long-term holders, then such demand could result in a supply squeeze. Related Reading: FUD Intensifies: Can Binance Survive Or Is This The End? The Santiment data also shows accumulation even among smaller addresses, so it is possible that XRP would test the $0.4 resistance level before the week is over. The low volatility associated with weekend markets could get in the way of XRP’s rally but it could also be a blessing in disguise to help the cryptocurrency hold any gains it may register between Thursday and Friday. XRP is trading at $0.38 at the time of this writing. It remains the sixth largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of approximately $19.2 billion.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The two firms plan to focus on expanding access to on-chain credit products and lower the cost of capital for traditional financial institutions, according to Archblock's Thursday press release.  Marcus Leanos, founder and chief investment said to CoinDesk, “We have a number of banks in our pipeline that range in size from $500 million to $5 billion in assets and have a history of conservatively originating loans.”  The news comes at a precarious time, with undercollateralized lending protocols grappling with loan defaults across the board. DeFi promised a way to make lending without collateral more transparent and less risky for investors, but loans to risk-taking crypto trading firms that ended up being insolvent have led to bad debt piling on protocols such as TrueFi and Maple.

Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin Finishes Roller-Coaster Week Near Where It Started  By Glenn Williams Jr.  One interpretation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week is that, while he acknowledged the recent progress in bringing down inflation, material increases in unemployment might still be necessary medicine to stabilize consumer prices that were rising earlier this year at their fastest pace in four decades.  The reality may have started to set in on Thursday as prices for bitcoin and ether moderated following Wednesday’s gains. Despite the increase in rates coming in slower, as expected, markets were seemingly caught off guard by Powell's hawkish commentary about the need to keep pressing forward, well into 2023.  So how is the latest Fed information dump playing in crypto markets? Sentiment for digital assets can be gauged in part by viewing BTC and ETH’s respective funding rates. Bitcoin’s funding rate recently dipped into negative territory, reflecting a shift to bearish sentiment. A look over the last month shows that funding rates have oscillated back and forth, unsurprising given uncertainty around BTC prices.  Read the full technical take here.

42388391,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREqJb,1671141268,Incoming House Financial Services Committee Chair Asks Secretary Yellen to Delay Crypto Tax Provision,"The top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee wants the U.S. Treasury Department to delay implementing the crypto tax provisions in last year's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act until there is further clarity around who's covered by the bill.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the current ranking member but who will its chair when Republicans take over the U.S. House of Representatives in the new Congress next month, wrote Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying the provision shouldn't be implemented until taxpayers know who will have to meet its requirements.  At issue is the definition of a ""broker"" for tax reporting purposes. When the legislation – then known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill – was introduced last year, industry participants warned the definition of a ""broker"" was overly broad, and could force entities such as miners and crypto wallet manufacturers to abide by tax reporting rules they physically would not be able to meet.  ""A number of questions and concerns remain unanswered regarding the scope of Section 80603,"" wrote McHenry. ""These questions and concerns must be addressed to ensure taxpayers have clear direction on the forthcoming requirements and the date required for compliance,"" he continued in the letter dated Dec. 14. ""Section 80603 is poorly drafted. As such it could be wrongly interpreted as expanding the definition of a ‘broker’ beyond custodial digital asset intermediaries.""  The Treasury Department has not issued formal guidance addressing this provision, but has said in letters to lawmakers that it would not include certain groups, such as miners, in the definition of ""broker.""  ""Treasury’s acknowledgement that ‘ancillary parties who cannot get access to information that is useful to the IRS are not intended to be captured by reporting requirements for brokers’ is a positive step,"" McHenry's letter said, referring to the Internal Revenue Service. ""It is also consistent with the policies outlined in H.R. 6006, Keep Innovation in America Act, which I introduced last year.""  A Treasury spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.  The letter also takes issue with another provision, which would incorporate crypto into Treasury's definition of ""cash,"" which in turn would impose new reporting requirements on any U.S. taxpayers who receive over $10,000 in cryptocurrency. These requirements would include personal information from the senders, including Social Security numbers.  Industry group Coin Center sued the Treasury Department earlier this year over the provision, calling it ""unconstitutional.""

42420862,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVq1,1671136875,Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin and Ether Stall Following Chair Powell’s Sobering Tone,"One interpretation of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week is that, while he acknowledged the recent progress in bringing down inflation, material increases in unemployment might still be necessary medicine to stabilize consumer prices that were rising earlier this year at their fastest pace in four decades.  The reality may have started to set in on Thursday as prices for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) moderated following Wednesday’s gains. Despite the increase in rates coming in slower, as expected, markets were seemingly caught off guard by Powell's hawkish commentary about the need to keep pressing forward, well into 2023.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s monetary-policy panel, released a fresh Summary of Economic Projections after this week’s meeting, including estimates for a 2023 unemployment rate that ranges from 4%-5.3%, up from the current 3.7%. The civilian labor force participation rate fell to 62.10% in November from 62.2% in the previous month. The civilian labor force participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed but looking for a job as a percentage of the population aged 16 years and over.  So how is the latest Fed information dump playing in crypto markets? Sentiment for digital assets can be gauged in part by viewing BTC and ETH’s respective funding rates.  Funding rates represent payments that occur on exchanges that facilitate the trading of perpetual futures contracts. When rates are positive, holders of long positions pay short positions. When negative, the opposite occurs. The extent to which funding rates are positive or negative can give a window into investor sentiment.  Bitcoin’s funding rate recently dipped into negative territory, reflecting a shift to bearish sentiment. A look over the last month shows that funding rates have oscillated back and forth, unsurprising given uncertainty around BTC prices.  Ether has taken a divergent path, showing positive funding rates for ETH during 14 of the most recent 16 trading days.  The lack of agreement between the two assets is eyebrow raising because BTC and ETH prices are generally highly correlated. The discrepancy has not yet been realized in spot markets as the ETH/BTC pair has traded flat over the past month.  So the sour taste of the medicine might be seeping into markets before it’s even administered.

The two firms plan to focus on expanding access to on-chain credit products and lower the cost of capital for traditional financial institutions, according to Archblock's Thursday press release.  “We have a number of banks in our pipeline that range in size from $500 million to $5 billion in assets and have a history of conservatively originating loans,” Marcus Leanos, founder and chief investment officer of MJL Capital, told CoinDesk.  The news comes at a precarious time, with undercollateralized lending protocols grappling with loan defaults across the board. DeFi promised a way to make lending without collateral more transparent and less risky for investors, but loans to risk-taking crypto trading firms that ended up being insolvent have led to bad debt piling on protocols such as TrueFi and Maple.  Read more: Maple Finance's $54M of Sour Debt Shows Risks of Crypto Lending Without Collateral  DeFi lending pivots to real-world assets  The partnership also highlights an accelerating trend in DeFi to cozy up with old-school banking and bring real-world assets such as bank loans, mortgages and corporate credit to blockchain-based protocols.  The idea is to provide a way for protocols to boost activity while crypto lending has plummeted during this year’s brutal market downturn, while at the same time traditional credit markets are offering attractive yields thanks to rising interest rates.  Recent examples of protocols linking up with banks are DeFi giant MakerDAO’s $100 million loan to Philadelphia-based community lender Huntingdon Valley Bank, and DeFi credit marketplace Credix opening a stablecoin credit pool with digital lender Clave to lend to Latin American businesses and consumers.  “There’s no limit to the type and range of financial assets that can be efficiently structured and financed on-chain using the technology,” Bill Wolf, chief investment officer of Archblock, said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/15/defi-protocol-developer-archblock-aims-to-onboard-us-community-banks-with-new-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/333a384df19b8a3b8dbab74ac0df30101328d92f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SBF was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday after the U.S. charged him with, among other things, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and campaign finance violations.  “From the DOJ’s perspective, SBF was spreading misinformation and was creating a lack of confidence in the regulators to police the market,” he said about Bankman-Fried’s string of media appearances.

SBF had donated upwards of $40 million to various political campaigns, including $5.2 million to Joe Biden’s successful U.S. presidential campaign in 2020.  But with the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried, who faces eight criminal charges, has “definitely” soured crypto’s reputation. Now, “there’s definitely an energy in federal law enforcement right now in going after crypto,” Mariotti said.  Mariotti said it is likely Bankman-Fried will be used as an example for why the digital asset industry needs more oversight. He said it is unlikely there will be any crypto-friendly regulation in the immediate future. Instead, he said, the industry may find itself facing “a lot of enforcement actions” in the short term, particularly from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  “The [Biden] administration believes that the digital asset space is unregulated and thinks that [crypto firms] can get away with anything,” Mariotti said. That is why federal regulators are “eager to plant a flag and send a message.”  Read more: FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Arrested in the Bahamas",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/15/us-government-wants-to-send-a-message-to-crypto-with-sbfs-arrest-says-former-us-prosecutor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de300f30593d1cc1ee5d1d758a0ee3a1330b59cb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

DNB did not specify what it would do if KuCoin continued to operate without a license. Customers of KuCoin and MGL are not in violation of the law, the central bank noted.  A KuCoin spokesperson responded that the company is registered in the Seychelles and does not have an office in the Netherlands.  ""As a global exchange, KuCoin pays close attention to the latest regulations all around the world, we respect laws and regulations of other jurisdictions,"" the spokesperson said in an email. ""However, KuCoin is not a Dutch entity and does not have an office in the Netherlands.""  KuCoin, which doesn’t have a license in the U.S., operates in over 200 countries and is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide by trading volume, partly because of its low trading fees.

42411295,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMia0,1671129582,Changpeng Zhao Won't Rescue Binance by Selling out Crypto Self-Custody,"In the aftermath of the collapse of FTX, many are justifiably concerned about the solvency of crypto exchanges. Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent bucket shop may have been an outlier – court documents filed earlier this week by U.S. authorities allege that some $8 billion in FTX customer deposits were transferred to and lost by SBF’s “hedge fund” Alameda Research.  But following a decline in crypto prices, a drawdown of debt between highly interconnected firms and several bankruptcy filings that have locked up billions worth of assets in legal proceedings, it’s reasonable to wonder if there is as much money held on centralized, largely unaudited crypto exchanges as there should be.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This is part of the reason why users are taking possession of their own coins in recent weeks. Binance, the industry leading centralized crypto exchange, in particular has seen a significant drawdown in funds. Some of its largest clients, such as Jump Trading, have taken coins out, and the exchange moved to temporarily halt USDC withdrawals amid the surge (potentially to execute a token swap to its own stablecoin).  See also: And Then There Was One – Changpeng Zhao – CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Earlier this week, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao referred to this trend as “business as usual.” He also reportedly told employees to brace for a few “bumpy” months ahead. The exchange had published a so-called “proof-of-reserves” report conducted by auditing firm Mazars showing, depending on which figures you include, it was either over- or under-collateralized in its bitcoin holdings.  Not to draw an unnecessary comparison to FTX, but CZ’s public comments this week are reminiscent of Bankman-Fried’s attempts to quell fears in early November amid a “run” on the exchange before it filed for bankruptcy protection. On Nov. 7, SBF tweeted that client funds were safe and backed by deposits – a message he deleted after it became clear FTX was deeply in the red. It’s a comparison CZ himself is drawing.  “With Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest, I think people generalize. So if you get hurt by one bank, you're gonna think all the other banks are bad. If one politician is corrupt, you think all politicians are corrupt,” he wrote. “But the fact is that because one bank is bad doesn't mean all the other banks are bad. And just because one politician is bad doesn't mean all the other politicians are bad.”  This is all well and good – except that crypto exchanges are not, in fact, banks. As my colleague David Z. Morris notes, the term “run on the bank” has been misapplied when talking about recent withdrawals on crypto exchanges. The phenomenon is similar: withdrawals beget withdrawals, fears over insolvency can compound and become self-fulfilling. But unlike banks, users simply have to take it as a matter of faith that exchange operators haven’t misused or lost customer funds.  Centralized crypto exchanges reintroduce an element of trust that trustless protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum remove from finance. Users take on the risks, even if rare, of hacks, frozen withdrawals and other business failures, Casa’s Nick Neuman said recently. And so, amid a period of uncertainty, Zhao’s primary responsibility is to reestablish confidence in his exchange.  Binance has certainly made moves to keep funds on its platform. On Wednesday, crypto critic Bitfinex’ed tweeted a screenshot of a Binance offering to pay 50% APR on staked USDT, seemingly to keep assets on the exchange. Later in the day, Zhao took to Twitter Spaces to criticize self-custodying crypto, alleging that “99% of people … will end up losing” their funds if they have to be responsible for their own keys.  This is no doubt a challenging time for Zhao. On Monday, Reuters reported the U.S. Department of Justice was nearing the end of a multi-year investigation into Binance – one of several ongoing probes into the firm from global law enforcement agencies. Federal prosecutors may ultimately charge CZ and other Binance executives with money-laundering violations, a risk that has accelerated withdrawals.  His comments spreading fears about self-custody are entirely unjustified. Not only is it seemingly in allegiance with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s recent Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act that would put unnecessary guardrails around so-called un-hosted wallets but also contradictory to Zhao’s comments just last month calling self-custody a “fundamental human right.”  See also: Self-Custodial Onboarding Will Be the Norm in Web3's 2023 | Crypto 2023  Rebuilding trust in Binance, stymying outflows, should not come at the expense of crypto’s principle innovation – enabling people to “be their own bank.”  FTX’s collapse was a startling turn of fate for what was once one of the most-trusted crypto companies. Bankman-Fried has gone from being the industry’s J.P. Morgan to its Bernie Madoff. It’s an event that has caused irreparable damage to crypto’s public standing. Binance, too, has an outsized role in the industry – and hopefully it is not another FTX.  But if Zhao has to make low blows to a fundamental attribute of crypto to rescue is own exchange’s reputation, then it deserves to fail. To take an old line from Zhao, “some things are better left unsaid. Recommend no more news like these, for the sake of the people, our industry (and your business).""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/15/changpeng-zhao-wont-rescue-binance-by-selling-out-crypto-self-custody,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2d546af9e30e0cbc03e45b7a996d65f0c871b08-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform experienced a bug that allowed COCOS to rise in the industry’s top ranking. As of this writing, CoinMarketCap removed the token, but its appearance raised some questions. Analyst Will Clemente asked his followers: What is this random shitcoin that just appeared at #6 on coin market cap? $12 million in 24-hour volume LOL (…). COCOS Ranks Alongside Bitcoin, Binance Coin, And Ethereum COCOS is Cocos-BCX’s native token. This platform is a GameFi incubator for “investment, distribution, IGO,” and community building. Its ultimate objective is to bridge people to the Web3 space and support “high-quality” projects in the sector. The platform provides users with a LaunchPad and Staking mechanism and is part of significant ecosystems, such as Binance Chain (BNB). However, data from CoinMarketCap shows that COCOS has a $12 million trading volume and a real market cap of $42 million. The latter increased by 5% in the past 24 hours, probably due to the bug in the listing platform. The cryptocurrency has been trending across other platforms, such as CoinGecko, recording a high search volume. Over the past month, the token moved against the general sentiment in the market and scored a 30% profit. In addition, the token is recording profits on high timeframes. It remains to be seen if it will maintain the upward trend in the current market conditions. The irruption of COCOS into the crypto top 10 by market, albeit an issue with CoinMarketCap, remind some users of the changes in this ranking. Over the last year, the crypto top 10 by market cap has seen multiple changes. Some users pointed to Internet Computer (ICP), a project led by the Dfinity Foundation that intruded into the ranking in 2021.

Bean and Kistner founded bZeroX, which ultimately became Ooki DAO, to offer unregistered derivatives products to U.S. customers. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Ooki DAO earlier this year, after settling with Bean and Kistner for their previous work with bZeroX. However, crypto industry participants took issue with the CFTC's effort to serve the entire DAO by posting in a web forum and help bot.  On Monday, a federal judge ruled that the CFTC should serve the Ooki DAO lawsuit to Bean and Kistner, as they had been token holders with the DAO.  However, in a letter filed with the court on Thursday, Jason Gottlieb of Morrison Cohen said while he could accept the suit on behalf of Bean and Kistner as individuals, the duo could not accept the suit on behalf of Ooki DAO.  ""In particular, as you no doubt recall, the settlement between our clients states (at page 14, Section 3(3)f): 'Respondents shall cease all participation in the governance, operation, or any other activities of the Ooki DAO. Without limitation, Respondents shall not make proposals, directly or indirectly through others, related to Ooki DAO governance; or vote any Ooki Tokens they own or control,'"" the letter said. ""As a result, Bean and Kistner no longer have any involvement with the governance of the Ooki DAO. Accordingly, Bean and Kistner are not authorized to accept service on behalf of 'the Ooki DAO' ‐‐ nor could they be.""  Gottlieb also noted that the CFTC had already settled its charges with Bean and Kistner.  Because of Bean and Kistner's lack of involvement with the DAO as a whole, as well as the previous settlement, Gottlieb wrote he did not think that the CFTC could serve the DAO by serving the two individuals, nor was he sure whether the regulator could serve the entire organization after settling with two alleged members of the group.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/15/bzerox-founders-are-no-longer-part-of-ooki-dao-lawyer-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c50b1b3997ee639198dc80b9cab6cda1a8467148-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some investors have speculated about this event marking the potential end of the crypto markets “craze” and a rejection of the Web3 token-driven economic model. Such prognostications demonstrate a lack of understanding about the issues at the core of the FTX saga and the evolution of the Web3 ecosystem. By Sandy Kaul, Head of Digital Assets and Industry Advisory Services, Franklin Templeton The FTX fallout is creating a reckoning in digital assets and cryptocurrencies. However, there are three takeaways from this event that point toward continued progress for the industry, according to Franklin Templeton Head of Digital Assets and Industry Advisory Services Sandy Kaul. Introduction I’m continuing to work on my second paper - part of a series of three - about technology megatrends. You can read my first paper, “ Evolution of commercial technologies and impact on business delivery ,” that talks about the innovation cycles that gave rise to these megatrends. In the meantime, I’d like to share my thoughts on the recent collapse of digital currency exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) and the impacts on the future of digital assets and cryptocurrency. FTX implosion and three takeaways FTX Chief Executive Officer ((CEO)) Sam Bankman-Fried was accused of wrongdoing, which resulted in the implosion of FTX as well as the bankruptcy of BlockFi, suspension of Genesis credit facilities, and losses for FTX investors and holders of the FTT-USD token. Some investors have speculated about this event marking the potential end of the crypto markets “craze” and a rejection of the Web3 token-driven economic model. Such prognostications demonstrate a lack of understanding about the issues at the core of the FTX saga and the evolution of the Web3 ecosystem. Three main takeaways about the crypto and Web3 domain should surface following the FTX fallout - all of which point toward the event as an important milestone likely to lead to greater understanding, professionalization and proper regulatory oversight of this emerging space. These developments will likely prove to be welcome in helping to cement the future of digital assets. Takeaway #1: Centralized crypto exchanges do not operate with the same level of transparency that decentralized crypto exchanges offer FTX was an exchange that allowed for the trading of digital asset and cryptocurrency tokens. There are two types of exchanges that facilitate such trading - centralized and decentralized models. Decentralized exchanges that trade in digital and crypto assets use independent node verifiers to confirm transactions and list all transactions on a blockchain ledger that is transparent and instantly shared across all participants in the network. Centralized exchanges that trade in crypto assets have an operating model that is much more akin to exchanges in the traditional financial realm. They confirm their own trades, maintain their own books and records, and apply their own oversight and compliance regime. Yet, centralized crypto exchanges are different from centralized exchanges in traditional financial markets in two key aspects: Centralized crypto exchanges have opted for a vertically integrated model where they both facilitate the trading of customer assets and then act as the custodian for those assets. Third-party custody - a hallmark of the traditional financial markets - is not a standard part of the offering for centralized crypto exchanges. While individual customers can choose to self-custody or transfer their assets to a digital custodian, that is not the default option on centralized crypto exchanges. Regulations that spell out the required safeguards, standards and audit requirements for centralized crypto exchanges are still lacking, particularly in the United States. Whereas centralized exchanges in the traditional financial markets are subject to stringent reporting and oversight requirements, there are (as of yet) no similar requirements for centralized crypto exchanges in key jurisdictions including the United States. Customers must trust that the controls in place at these centralized crypto exchanges are adequate to ensure the proper administration of transactions and safekeeping of customer funds. These factors are what allowed FTX to - knowingly or unknowingly - mishandle customer funds. FTX was a centralized crypto exchange. Without any outside oversight of their activities, the exchange was able to operate with what turned out to be a poor set of controls that allowed them to transfer customer funds to FTX’s sister-trading company, Alameda Research, leaving a hole in the FTX balance sheet and ultimately leading to the collapse of the exchange. As the FTX blow-up was occurring, volumes on decentralized exchanges trading crypto and digital assets exploded to four times their previous levels. 1 Yet, these decentralized crypto exchanges were able to handle that increase in the pace of transactions without any issues or concerns. Moreover, every one of those transactions was affirmed by at least 51% of the network participants, and the entire ledger of trades and customer holdings were synchronized and shared across every network participant in close to real-time. This transparency was a marked contrast to the obscurity of the FTX ledger. Thus, one takeaway from the FTX fallout should be that the transparency public blockchains offer can be seen as a significant deterrent to bad actors in terms of their access to and authority over customer funds. Takeaway #2: Know your token and invest in tokens that reflect the value of the offering entity Another facet of the FTX story was the use of the exchange’s own token as collateral for leveraged loans and the broad purchase of this token as an investment vehicle by other investors. FTX had issued its own token called FTT-USD. FTT-USD was a “utility” token - it did not represent a claim on the revenues or the profits of the FTX exchange, but rather, entitled the holders of the token to obtain discounts on their trading activity on the FTX exchange. In a sense, it was like a loyalty program. Although the bids and offers on FTX and other exchanges determine the value of a token, the desire of FTT-USD holders to transact on FTX wholly influenced its value. In other words, holders had taken a speculative bet based on their view that more and more participants would want to transact on FTX and thus drive up the value of their tokens. FTX had transferred a large amount of these FTT-USD tokens to the firm’s sister trading company, Alameda Research. In turn, Alameda had used the tokens as collateral against which it took on leveraged loans. When customers began withdrawing funds from FTX as concerns about the stability of the exchange grew, the value of the FTT-USD token began to fall precipitously. This triggered a chain reaction that resulted in Alameda needing to increase the amount of collateral it had posted to maintain its leveraged loans. The size of such collateral calls quickly ballooned. Speculation is that the transfer of customer funds from FTX to Alameda was done in part to plug this collateral hole. Investigators have yet to determine all the details of what had occurred. This aspect of the FTX story highlights two issues. First, in traditional financial markets, firms would be discouraged from using their own stock to finance leveraged loans for the very issue Alameda faced. Because a drop in the value of the stock could result in a short squeeze that requires more assets from the organization to maintain its position at a time when the balance sheet is under pressure. However, this issue was exacerbated by the fact that Alameda was using the FTT-USD token as the basis of their collateral. This asset did not reflect the value of the FTX exchange or represent any claims on the FTX balance sheet. A utility token’s value is likely to disappear altogether if the sponsoring entity is seen as having failed. It is not backed by any actual assets. Thus, a second takeaway from the FTX fallout is that investors and financing partners need to understand the nature of the token that they are utilizing as collateral and determine whether that token is reflective of the sponsoring entity’s business value rather than just being a utility or entertainment token (e.g., Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) or Shiba Inu ( SHIB-USD )). Moreover, the excessive buildup of a position in FTT-USD on Alameda’s balance sheet would have been spotted far earlier if those transactions were occurring and being validated on a public blockchain. Takeaway #3: A crypto investment is still an investment and requires adequate diligence and oversight FTX had raised nearly US$2 billion from over 80 investors in just over two years, 2 including brand-name firms from the traditional financial ecosystem and several institutional investors. The charismatic personality of Sam Bankman-Fried, his pitch about the complexities and nuances of the digital asset ecosystem, his high-profile marketing deals, and the welcome reception he got from legislators and regulators prompted many investors to take a bet on his venture. Taking such bets is the essence of venture capital and of private investing, and the desire to support emerging businesses and entrepreneurs should be celebrated. Yet, many of those that invested in the FTX venture did so without insisting on the financial modeling, controls, disclosures and diligence that investments in the traditional start-up space typically entail. Like the rush to lock in capacity at hedge funds in the early 2000s, there was a similar rush by venture and private investment firms to obtain exposure to crypto-native offerings as quickly as possible; often based on their belief in a visionary founder - a profile that fit Sam Bankman-Fried, according to multiple reports. Fear of missing out on an investment is not reason enough to ignore potential warning signs. Belief in the founder was described as a bedrock requirement for FTX. News analysis indicated that the company’s 30-year-old former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, insisted that he be the only one to run the company. Requests to install a more experienced executive resulted in the exclusion of potential investors from the pool. 3 He allegedly informed existing investors that they should “support him and observe.” 4 He refused to allow investors to create an independent board of directors and appoint representatives to ensure adequate oversight. 5 Moreover, he was not pushed to disclose other potential business conflicts of interest, including his ownership and relationship with Alameda Research. 6 Finally, although audited financials were created for 2020 and 2021, two different auditors for different FTX entities - FTX US and FTX Trading - prepared these reports. Neither auditor provided an opinion on internal controls over accounting and financial reporting 7 - in and of itself an unusual move. Both audit firms had few public company clients and none with the scale and complexity of FTX. Both auditors were small enough that the firms themselves were only audited every three years, and each had poor track records with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). 8 These audit reports were released in April 2022, but the results did not trigger any red flags. The final takeaway from the FTX fallout is that the digital asset and crypto domain are still business ventures, and although they may have slightly different operating and payment models, these differences should not exempt those seeking capital from providing disclosures and transparency to potential investors, nor allow them to operate without adequate corporate governance and oversight. Conclusion The collapse of FTX and the resulting impacts are creating a reckoning in the digital asset and crypto domain. However, rather than marking the end of investment interest in this emerging ecosystem, the event is instead likely to prompt a deeper understanding of nuances within the space between decentralized and centralized exchanges, the relationship of a token to its issuing entity, and most importantly, the need for due diligence and proper oversight - hallmarks of what active managers should provide for their clients. Though the FTX fallout may slow the growth of the crypto economy, in my view, it is unlikely to derail the path of evolution that these new technologies offer. Just as the hedge fund industry survived Bernie Madoff and emerged stronger for the new oversight and controls put into place in the wake of that fraud, the digital asset and crypto industry is likely to enter a more professional and regulated phase as a result of the FTX collapse. What Are The Risks? All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. The value of investments can go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full amount invested. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Investments in fast-growing industries like the technology sector (which historically has been volatile) could result in increased price fluctuation, especially over the short term, due to the rapid pace of product change and development and changes in government regulation of companies emphasizing scientific or technological advancement or regulatory approval for new drugs and medical instruments. Buying and using blockchain-enabled digital currency carries risks, including the loss of principal. Speculative trading in bitcoins and other forms of cryptocurrencies, many of which have exhibited extreme price volatility, carries significant risk. Among other risks, interactions with companies claiming to offer cryptocurrency payment platforms or other cryptocurrency-related products and services may expose users to fraud. Blockchain technology is a new and relatively untested technology and may never be implemented to a scale that provides identifiable benefits. Investing in cryptocurrencies and ICOs is highly speculative and an investor can lose the entire amount of their investment.

""It's really dangerous to think that you have one black swan, you're going to see them everywhere – like, you’re going to have criminal organizations all over the place and these places run by sociopaths,"" the CEO of cryptocurrency-focused financial services firm Galaxy Digital Holdings ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) told CNBC. ""I don't think that under every rock there's a guy stealing your money,"" he added. On this year's meltdown in the crypto market, Novogratz tried to put the sharp declines in historical perspective. He argued that easy monetary policy helped drive Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) from $8K to $60K during its boom years. Meanwhile, the tightening of monetary policy in 2022, with the Federal Reserve and other central banks aggressively raising interest rates, contributed to a retracement back down to $17K. However, the Galaxy CEO predicted that authorities would eventually need to ease their tight fiscal and monetary policies, a turn that will drive crypto prices higher in future. In addition, he argued that adoption continued to expand for the industry. ""Even in this terrible bear market of crypto, you're seeing new ways that people can participate in Bitcoin and the crypto market,"" he said. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has suffered a massive decline in 2022. The crypto is currently trading at around $17,419, down about 4% in Thursday's trading and lower by almost 64% over a period of one year. Novogratz isn't the only big-name investor to speak up for the crypto industry in the wake of the FTX scandal.

5668203,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512522,1671125434,This Indicator Says MATIC Price Correction Is Not Done,"MATIC price is currently undergoing a correction. Over the last 24 hours, the coin has lost more than 4% of its market value. Signs on the chart currently suggest that MATIC is going to remain in the correction territory for some time. All the gains that Polygon (MATIC) secured in the past week were undone due to the loss on the daily chart. Technical outlook also implied that the price momentum for the altcoin was regressive and demand for the altcoin declined over the past few days. From the daily chart reading, it is difficult to ascertain where the MATIC price will find support. The altcoin is depicting signs of significant resistance in both the shorter and longer time frame. A bullish reversal seems unlikely as buyers have lost confidence in the asset. For MATIC the past few months have been quite tough as the coin continued to fall despite reserving the $1.31 price mark for some time in the past month. At the present moment, MATIC is trading at a 69% low compared to its all-time high registered almost one year ago. It is now imperative for MATIC to break past the $0.96 level for registering some positive price movement. Related Reading: Tron Price Prediction: Why TRX Could Outperform BTC and ETH MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart The coin has broken its lower band of consolidation and is on a downward spiral. The overhead resistance for the coin was $0.94. A move above $0.94 will secure the altcoin’s move to $1 or even higher. Since MATIC has broken on the downside of the consolidation, further depreciation can follow. In that case, the altcoin will fall to $0.84 and then below the $0.80 price level. The amount of the altcoin traded in the last session fell and was red, indicating that bears were mauling hard. The altcoin was exchanging hands at $0.88 at press time. Technical Analysis The coin has formed an ascending support line. Typically, this is a bullish sign; however, in this case, MATIC is moving closer to the line. This indicates that the coin will fall below the $0.88 line and fall close to $0.84, which is another 4% depreciation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was under the half-line, meaning that sellers had taken over the price. In regards to sellers, the price of the altcoin fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. A fall beneath that indicates bearishness, as sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Investor interest also showed a decline on the daily chart. The Chaikin Money Flow represents the capital inflows and outflows at a given point. CMF portrayed a downtick which meant a fall in capital inflows, although capital inflows were still exceeding capital outflows at press time.

The digital asset had been able to clear $18,000 for the first time since the FTX collapse as a result of this. However, the FOMC announcement that would follow on Wednesday would shock the market back into its shell, sending bitcoin’s price spiraling downwards once more. Bitcoin Reels From Announcement Even though the interest rate hike was not as high as previous ones, it still had some effect on the crypto market. Just after the announcement, bitcoin had rallied to a local peak of $18,300 before starting back down once more. However, the overall outlook toward the FOMC meeting remains positive during this time. Related Reading: FUD Intensifies: Can Binance Survive Or Is This The End? Dmitry Ivanov, CMO at CoinsPaid, notes this positivity has come with the interest rate hike that came out to only 50 basis points (BPS). “The digital currency ecosystem is beaming with positivity with respect to the interest rate hike that saw the US Federal Reserve less aggressive than it has been,” Ivanov told NewsBTC. “Of particular interest to industry stakeholders are the fact that corporate investors will have more money on their balance sheet with a reduced borrowing cost, and this can be invested in alternative assets like Bitcoin.” BTC price hovering at $17,600 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin has since returned to the levels where it was trending before the FOMC announcement but this renewed positive outlook in the financial markets has worked to help it maintain its value above $17,600 for the most part. Will BTC Finish 2022 Weak? With only two weeks left in the year, there are concerns about how the digital asset will close out in 2022. So far, there has been markedly weak movement in the market, impacted by the high inflation levels as the Fed remains hawkish in its stance to drag inflation to 2% over time. Related Reading: What Ethereum’s Rejection At $1,350 Says About The Cryptocurrency Ivanov also touches on this in his statements saying “That the Feds tapered their interest rate hikes does not imply that inflation is reduced.” However, the CoinsPaid CMO believes that bitcoin will be able to retain more of its value compared to fiat currencies as more institutional money frees up to possibly go into the crypto market. If the market maintains its positive outlook, there is a possibility for more growth in the price of bitcoin over time. Ivanov also looks to the end of the year through a more positive lens, predicting a 4.5% increase for the digital asset. “As it stands, Bitcoin is poised to overcome the latest negative slip and benefit from this latest Fed move, and we can see the price surge beyond $18,500 by the end of the year.” Featured image from Medium, chart from TradingView.com",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/fed-interest-rate-hike-triggers-pullback-is-bitcoin-headed-for-a-weak-finish/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Enter Console, a blockchain-based messaging platform that hopes to fix some of the issues that plague other social platforms like spam and misinformation and bring privacy and data ownership centerstage.  Founded by serial entrepreneurs David Leiberman and Chris Castiglione, the platform opened for beta testing on Thursday, calling itself the ""evolution of group chat"" by integrating Web3 tools that allow for greater collaboration between builders and communities.  ""Today social platforms are broken,” said Castiglione. “Console puts the power back into the hands of communities. Users control their identity, and communities can leverage this trust to improve coordination and engagement.""  Specifically, the platform addresses issues with other social networks like ""spam, bots, and sock puppets"" by offering features like identity verification through web wallet login and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains. In addition, Console offers tools that support voting, threaded messages, events, bounties and treasury to help budding crypto communities scale their efforts.  ""Web3 transforms the internet into powerful, interconnected and composable Lego, and Console is the base layer for assembling communities,"" said Castiglione.  According to the company, over 400 artists, non-fungible token (NFT) holders, creators and musicians have already been onboarded onto the platform. Trevor Owens, founder of Crash Punks and Console user, described the platform as ""Discord built from the ground up for Web3 communities.""  Read more: How to Find Your Community in Web3  The open-source platform calls itself ""progressively decentralized, secure-by-design and community-owned."" The beta launch is the first stage of the ConsoleDAO, the organization behind the platform aimed at ""influencing, contributing to, and sharing in Console’s future growth.""  ""We see Web3 as a movement that returns the internet back to its roots – to build apps that return the power back to the people,"" Castiglione said. ""I believe that if we’re going to build a more democratic, free internet, then we need to build it on a foundation of tools that respect those values.  Console arrives as the conversation about decentralized social networks continues to grow louder.

5665275,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512515,1671123202,"AVAX Eyes The Next Resistance, Is It Time To Go Long?","The Avalanche (AVAX) price has been undetermined for quite a number of weeks now. The altcoin is now logging gains on the daily chart as it rose over 3% in that time frame. The coin shows signs of optimism ever since it moved up from the $12.90 support mark. The technical outlook for AVAX displayed signs of demand and buy signals for traders. If demand continues to rise and buying sentiment increases over the immediate trading sessions, the chance of AVAX piercing through other resistance levels will strengthen further. As the coin continues to secure higher highs and higher lows, the bulls still remain in charge of the asset. However, if AVAX starts to consolidate below the $13 price level, then the altcoin can register depreciation. Progressive price momentum demands AVAX breach the $14.30 resistance mark. Once AVAX successfully manages to challenge that level, the bulls will stick around for longer. The market capitalisation of the altcoin already registered an upsurge which is tied to an increase in accumulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crystal Ball – What Happens To BTC After Christmas 2022? Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart The immediate overhead price ceiling that Avalanche price needs to breach stood at $13.90. This move would ensure another rally to $14.60. Once the coin moves past that level, accumulation will increase considerably. Traders had ample entry points in the market; for instance when AVAX dipped to $12. Over the upcoming trading sessions, investors can manage to see returns on the chart. On the other hand, if due to lack of demand AVAX starts to consolidate, the next level for the coin would be at $12.20 and then to $11. This would mean an 18% fall in price for AVAX. AVAX was trading at $13.48 at the time of writing. AVAX Technical Analysis Although the technical outlook pointed to positive price action, demand slightly fell on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) just dipped a little and rested on the half-line. This meant that buying power and selling strength were even. Other indicators have, however, sided with increased demand. The altcoin was above the 20-day Simple Moving Average as it crossed the $13.40 price mark. This was an indication that the buyers were still driving the price momentum in the market. Despite the RSI remaining neutral, other indicators have depicted that bulls were still fighting to push the price above $13.60.

The Department of Justice has named Octopus Information Ltd., Gibraltar-based Wincent Investment Fund and a number of individual investors to represent the potentially million people owed money by the collapse of the Bahamas-based firm, whose founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now in a Bahamas jail.  “We had a tremendous response” to the request to sit on the committee, U.S. Trustee Juliet Sarkessian told a bankruptcy court in Delaware on Wednesday, citing difficulties in gathering a group of people from across the world.  “We are moving as expeditiously as possible” to set the committee up, Sarkessian, a Department of Justice official charged with administering the bankruptcy process, added.  The committee, responsible for representing those who are hoping to be repaid at the conclusion of bankruptcy proceedings – specifically the unsecured creditors who have no claim on FTX collateral – will also include hedge fund Coincident Capital, GGC International (a Bermuda-based affiliate of Genesis Trading, which shares a parent company with CoinDesk in Digital Currency Group) and Hong Kong’s Pulsar Global, the filing said.  On Friday the Delaware court will hear a controversial proposal to redact personal information rather than publishing a full – and potentially very long – list of creditors.  On Tuesday, CoinDesk reported moves to create a separate committee to represent the distinct needs of foreign creditors of Bankman-Fried’s sprawling empire.

An ERC-20 token refers to any cryptocurrency created on the Ethereum blockchain.  “It’s been a pain point for customers who sent ERC-20 tokens to a Coinbase receive address,” Will Robinson, vice president of engineering at Coinbase, told TechCrunch. “When people accidentally sent these assets, they were effectively stuck up until this point.”  The feature will become available in the next few weeks for customers, except those in Japan or users of Coinbase Prime. There will be a 5% recovery fee for amounts over $100 in addition to a separate network fee that applies to all recoveries.  While transfers of ERC-20 tokens aren’t significant, they are popular among developers who want to create their own tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and other users who believe in the networks behind those tokens.  Some of the most popular ERC-20 tokens are uniswap (UNI), aave (AAVE), 0x (ZRX) and chainlink (LINK).  Before the tool was launched, customers who sent unsupported ERC-20 tokens to a Coinbase address would receive a notification saying the funds were delivered, but they weren’t actually sent to the receiver’s wallets. This would cause users to lose those tokens and funds associated with them.  Some of those tokens can now be recovered, according to Coinbase, if users can provide their Ethereum transaction identification for the lost assets and its contact address.  “We make no quality representation of these assets, as they haven’t gone through our review process, but we’re facilitating the returns that accidentally sent it in the first place,” Robinson said.  A recovery for other tokens besides ERC-20-based ones could become available in the future, Coinbase said, but it’s not something the exchange wants to commit to right now.

""We are financially strong,"" the crypto pioneer, widely known in the crypto world as CZ, told CNBC, while also taking shots at the high-profile advertising and investments made by FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the runup to the collapse of the Binance competitor. ""We don't use customers' money. We have revenue. Our revenue comes from trading fees and we have very solid revenue. We do not spend on crazy advertisements. We're okay,"" Zhao said. The Binance CEO stressed that ""well-run crypto exchanges,"" like his, ""should hold user assets one-to-one."" This comment alludes to charges that Bankman-Fried and FTX redirected user assets for other purposes. CZ also directly took on some of his critics, especially Kevin O'Leary, the high-profile investor who has come under fire as an investor and paid spokesperson for FTX. O'Leary has publicly accused Binance of deliberately triggering FTX's collapse. ""He's making a bunch of nonsense claims and they don't make sense, they don't make any logic,"" the Binance CEO said of the Shark Tank star. Asked why Binance wouldn't submit to a formal audit by one of the Big Four accounting firms, as part of an effort to reassure users that the company's finances were sound, CZ argued that the issue largely stems from shortcomings in the accounting firms themselves. ""Many audit firms are scared to work with crypto businesses,"" he said, adding that the larger players in the industry ""don't know how to audit crypto exchanges."" The FTX scandal, which saw Bankman-Fried arrested earlier this week on charges of fraud, has put additional pressure on a crypto market that has already suffered tremendously in 2022. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reached a low for the year of $15,464.84 in the wake of the FTX implosion, although it has since rebounded, trading at around $17,430 in Thursday's action. BTC-USD remains about 63% lower for 2022 as a whole. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has seen similar trading. The crypto reached a 52-week low of $883.48 and has bounced back to around $1,270 by Thursday's midday action. ETH-USD is down about 67% in 2022. Meanwhile, a wide swath of crypto-related stocks has suffered along with their underlying assets. Here are some major crypto players and their year-to-date performances: MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) -66% , Coinbase Global ( COIN ) -85% , Silvergate Capital ( SI ) -87% and Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) -83% .

So, is crypto done? Not by a long shot. We believe crypto’s financial disruption is here to stay, and share here our top crypto predictions for 2023. Volatility is a given with crypto. The “crypto winter” stole most of the digital asset headlines throughout 2022, and the year is closing out with a spate of rapid collapses and bankruptcies. So, is crypto done? Not by a long shot. We believe crypto’s financial disruption is here to stay. We explore why as we share here our top crypto predictions for 2023. 1. Bitcoin will test $10-12K in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter. The MVIS ® Global Digital Assets Mining Index median market cap is now only $180M, with nearly all constituents burning cash and trading well below book value. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining largely unprofitable given recent higher electricity prices and lower Bitcoin prices, we predict that many miners will restructure or merge. Ripple ( XRP-USD ) losing its SEC lawsuit (possible in Q1, more on this below) may coincide with this final downdraft, which would take out nearly the entirety of the post-2020 halving bull market. 2. In the second half of 2023, Bitcoin will rise to $30K. Lower inflation, easing energy concerns, a possible truce in Ukraine, and a turnaround in M2 supply will power the start of a new bull market. Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem have suffered through a brutal bear market in 2022. Numerous companies in the space have imploded and sentiment is quite poor. Bitcoin has traded like a risk asset over the prior year and has shown price sensitivity to interest rate hikes. One reason why Bitcoin has reacted poorly to higher rates is that the political response to higher inflation in developed markets has been to attempt to cap energy prices, widen sanctions, and micro-manage economic activity to facilitate the “energy transition.” An end to the war in Ukraine would likely reverse at least some of these policies and make Bitcoin mining more politically palatable. On the other hand, the war is also creating a more economically integrated Eurasia with incentives to adopt novel payments methods for cross-border trade, as Russia and China are doing with the digital RMB and possible gold-for-oil swaps. In developed markets, we think consumers will see Bitcoin act as a store of value over time and a hedge against M2 inflation rather than overt CPI inflation. In emerging markets, the focus is more on remittances and neutral alternatives to dollar hegemony. Meanwhile, should our recession expectations materialize, the Federal Reserve would likely pause raising rates amidst softening inflation, while money printing and government budget deficits continue. Merely a lack of bad crypto-specific news, under the above scenario, could cause the price of Bitcoin to climb a wall of worry back to $30K again. 3. Financial institutions will tokenize more than $10B in off-chain assets. Institutions will employ blockchains to simplify custody and settlement, while reducing costs for customers. KYC/AML will be enabled using identity protocols and permissioned sub-networks/applications. Already, MakerDAO ( MKR-USD ) has plans to deploy $1B into U.S. T-bills and other government securities with the help of BlackRock ( BLK ) and Coinbase ( COIN ), allowing Dai ( DAI-USD ) holders to earn a higher yield on deposits. 1 Real-world loans on platforms such as Goldfinch, TrueFi, Maple and Clearpool sum to another $300M+. KKR has tokenized one of its private funds in partnership with Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) and Securitize. The Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian is a collaborative initiative with the financial industry that seeks to test the feasibility of applications in asset tokenization and DeFi. MAS recently participated in transactions against liquidity pools comprising tokenized Singapore Government Securities, Japanese Government Bonds, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. Among open-source blockchains, we think Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), Avalanche, Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) and Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ) are best-positioned. We can also predict with high confidence that industry pioneer VanEck will originate real-world assets on open-source blockchains in 2023. 4. Brazil will emerge as one of the most crypto-friendly countries of the world and tokenize a portion of sovereign debt offerings on blockchain. With persistent inflation and a young population, Latin America is seeing the fastest crypto and stablecoin adoption in the world. Brazilian regulators have been aggressive in giving private companies a sandbox to play in this area. Itau Unibanco ( ITUB ), the country’s largest bank, plans to launch an asset tokenization platform to transform traditional financial products into tokens and offer custody services for clients. Tokenization of sovereign debt may begin in Brazil first. 5. Twitter will bolster its payment offerings with state money licenses, competing more directly with Venmo and Cash App. Twitter’s current payment abilities are restricted to peer-to-peer tipping, including Bitcoin over the Lightning Network, but the user experience is poor. We expect Elon Musk to implement payments functionality more akin to WeChat Pay ( TCEHY ), which would let consumers pay merchants for services. In November, Twitter filed registration paperwork with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (finCEN) to pave the way for it to process payments, according to the New York Times . Such an endeavor is likely to include dollars, Bitcoin, and possibly other crypto assets like Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ). 6. A nation, most likely one dependent on oil exports, will announce it is adding Bitcoin and other digital assets to its sovereign wealth fund. We have heard first-hand from multiple crypto companies that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth funds are already mining Bitcoin, though at small scale. In addition, Russian government officials have clearly stated intentions to settle cross-border trade in crypto assets. Russia’s largest bank Sberbank ( AKSJF ) recently integrated its blockchain platform with MetaMask and the Ethereum blockchain. And multiple Russian media have also reported that Russians have been aggressively buying Bitcoin mining ASICS ( ASCCF , ASCCY ) in November. 7. A new decentralized stablecoin will reach $1B in market cap. A stablecoin is a digital currency that is pegged to a “stable” reserve asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. Stablecoin projects differ in how they maintain their peg. For example, USDT-USD and USDC-USD are both run by centralized entities who collateralize their tokens with fiat reserves, including cash and government treasuries. Dai, on the other hand, is administered by a decentralized entity whose users deposit ETH-USD into smart contracts to mint the dollar-denominated, over-collateralized Dai. There are more than $5B in Dai outstanding as of 11/17/2022. 2 Algorithmic stablecoins differ in the fact that they are collateralized with digital assets and either under- or over-collateralized. Typically, algorithmic stablecoins maintain their peg with the backing of another digital asset and/or an on-chain algorithm that balances supply and demand. Some applications of algorithmic stablecoins include: use in trading, using them to run Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and providing staking rewards to holders. We continue to observe considerable demand for censorship-resistant stablecoins, which cannot be seized by regulators. Thus, despite the collapse of LUNA-USD and its associated algorithmic stablecoin UST-USD losing its peg, we see various decentralized stablecoins continuing to launch in 2023, including Aave’s ( AAVE-USD ) GHO offering, which will employ an overcollateralization strategy and rely on arbitrage and community-led monetary policy to stabilize the token at $1. 8. Ripple will lose the SEC lawsuit. Ripple Labs has been engaged in a legal battle with the SEC since 2020 over their token, XRP-USD. The SEC lawsuit alleges that XRP-USD is an unregistered security. Considering the prominence of Ripple and XRP-USD in the digital asset space, the result of this case could have far-reaching effects throughout the industry and set a precedent for future cases. Ripple has the support of many large players in the industry, including Coinbase and Blockchain Association. This support has only increased, with 12 independent entities now offering legal support to Ripple. Both the SEC and Ripple have called for a summary judgement from a federal judge in the case, so a decision by end of Q1 is likely. Unfortunately for crypto bulls, the SEC won its lawsuit against blockchain-based publishing company LBRY ( LBC-USD ) in November, with a U.S. district judge in New Hampshire writing that “nothing in the case law suggests that a token with both consumptive and speculative use cases cannot be sold as an investment contract.” With this case as precedent, we have lowered our probability of a Ripple victory materially. Ripple’s CEO has said the crypto company will move to another country if it loses. Significant financial penalties (disgorgement) are also possible. 9. Gary Gensler will leave the SEC, as proposed legislation fails to gain wide support. Crypto enthusiasts had hoped that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler would be a proponent of advancing the digital assets ecosystem in the U.S. However, the SEC has continued to deny or postpone decisions on Bitcoin spot ETFs on grounds of “market manipulation”. Bizarrely, Bitcoin futures ETFs and even inverse Bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved. Chairman Gensler has stated on several occasions that he considers Bitcoin to be a commodity but most other digital assets to be securities. Still, considerable uncertainty remains in regard to which agency will regulate the industry, as the SEC and CFTC jockey over the right to regulate the space. That a spot Bitcoin ETF has been hostage of this dispute is unfortunate, given that proper guidance and regulation may have potentially prevented some of the crypto industry blow-ups from occurring in 2022. Specifically, Grayscale’s GBTC Bitcoin trust, which trades at a ~48% discount to NAV, sits at the center of questionable loans made by several market participants. Thus, we see a rising probability that Chairman Gensler is replaced, now that the 2022 midterm elections have passed, as he faces increasing scrutiny that may become a political liability for the White House. Four U.S. lawmakers sent him a letter on November 8 deriding him for the SEC’s double standard when it comes to transparency. New York Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres also wrote to the U.S. Comptroller in December requesting that the federal legislative watchdog conduct a review of the SEC’s failure to protect the public from “the egregious mismanagement and malfeasance of FTX ( FTT-USD ).” The strongly worded letter also criticized Chairman Gensler’s leadership in general. Even the SEC’s union of 3,500 staffers is fighting the Chairman over pensions, returning to work and an overly stretched workforce. Since 1934, the average tenure of an SEC chair is 2.75 years; the median is 2. Our predicted SEC victory over Ripple could provide a graceful face-saving exit. 10. Total web3 monthly gamers will rise from 2M to 20M as multiple triple-A games come to market. The total addressable market ((TAM)) in traditional gaming is massive, at $300B and 3.2B people globally. Gaming is a digital-native activity, and in-game items (aka digital assets) are already being bought and used by hundreds of millions of gamers around the world. Still, we believe category gaps exist between traditional and crypto games, creating white space for growth . Specifically, blockchain-enabled games open up the possibility to transfer in-game assets between games, which does not currently exist. That said, early play-to-earn and play-to-own games have lacked high-quality production value and sufficiently large budgets to attract mass market users. A number of traditional “triple-A” games are aiming to fill that gap with tentpole releases in 2023. We think one of them is likely to go viral. In defense of this prediction, we observe that the traditional gaming industry is increasingly excited about the potential of the future of web3. EA CEO Andrew Wilson recently called web3 “the future of our industry”. The sentiment is echoed by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, who stated that blockchain gaming is a “revolution” in the industry and who recently announced plans to develop blockchain games. Microsoft ( MSFT ), whose Activision acquisition is now in jeopardy due to an FTC lawsuit, has also been investing in web3 startups as part of their exploration of the space. Industry-wide, gaming companies have been hiring blockchain, NFT, and crypto experts as they search for the next evolution in gaming. With blockchain games and metaverse platforms on pace to attract $9B in venture capital investment this year, the chances of a breakthrough hit in 2023 are better than ever. 11. Ethereum will enable withdrawals from the Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain is the name of the pre-Merge, proof-of-stake Ethereum blockchain. It was created to ensure the proof-of-stake consensus logic was sound and sustainable before enabling it on the Ethereum Mainnet. The Merge took place in September 2022, resulting in the Ethereum Mainnet merge with the Beacon Chain and transitioning to a singular blockchain with a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Stakers are currently receiving ~5% annual interest rates in return for committing ETH. However, withdrawals have not been enabled, potentially hindering adoption. Enabling Beacon Chain withdrawals would give stakers more confidence to commit capital to the protocol. The percentage % of ETH staked could potentially rise from ~13% to above 25%. Disclosures 1 Source: MakerDAO 2 Source: Coinmarketcap.com Index Definition The MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index (MVDAM) of the global digital asset mining segment. This is a modified market cap-weighted index, and only includes companies that generate at least 50% of their revenue from digital assets mining activities or mining related hardware, software or services, or projects that have the potential to generate at least 50% of their revenues from digital assets mining when developed. MVDAM covers at least 90% of the investable universe.

Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear. Cryptocurrencies are not covered by either FDIC or SIPC insurance. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of cryptocurrency. Investing in cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future. Investors should conduct extensive research into the legitimacy of each individual cryptocurrency, including its platform, before investing. The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be complex, technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate. The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain or other underlying technology. Some cryptocurrency transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction may have been initiated. Investors must have the financial ability, sophistication and willingness to bear the risks of an investment and a potential total loss of their entire investment in cryptocurrency. An investment in cryptocurrency is not suitable or desirable for all investors. Cryptocurrency has limited operating history or performance. Fees and expenses associated with a cryptocurrency investment may be substantial. There may be risks posed by the lack of regulation for cryptocurrencies and any future regulatory developments could affect the viability and expansion of the use of cryptocurrencies.

42407231,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJsJA,1671117625,The Next Step in the Evolution of Web3: Regenerative Finance,"The term ""degen,"" short for degenerate, has become a term of endearment in the crypto community. Its usage stems from the high-risk, high-reward nature of digital asset trading – and the propensity for people to bet the house. If Wall Street ever looked down on crypto’s volatility and Ponzi-nomics, Web3 has embraced it as a badge of honor.  But it’s a mistake to let this hedonistic mentality become the default for how crypto is understood. Web3 looks like a joke when dogecoin, a cryptocurrency explicitly created as a meme, sits in the top 10 digital assets by market cap. Yes, it is (remarkably still) funny. And yes, it’s important that crypto knows how to laugh at itself.  Linda Adami is the founder and CEO of Quantum Temple. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023.  But we’re in danger of letting the revolutionary potential of blockchain become a punchline. What many don't realize is that beneath the volatile prices and meme-worthy facade, Web3 is a transformative force that has the potential to bank the unbanked, unlock new economic value and build a more equitable future.  Regenerative finance (ReFi)  In a 2015 paper titled Regenerative Capitalism, economist and philosopher John Fullerton described “regenerative economics” as a type of economic design that maximizes value to communities by regenerating what has been lost, conserving what remains and ensuring long-term financial prosperity.  In other words, it's a way of thinking about the economy that takes into account the negative externalities that have often been ignored by traditional capitalism. This includes things like environmental destruction, social inequality and financial instability.  While Fullerton wasn't discussing cryptocurrencies specifically, the same principles can be applied to the way we think about decentralized finance (DeFi). In its simplest form, DeFi is about democratizing access to financial services and removing intermediaries that often take advantage of their position.  The concept of a regenerative economy is still in its early stages, but there are already a few examples of Web3 projects using ReFi principles to create positive change.  Carbon trading with tokens and NFTs  In the past few decades, we've seen firsthand the devastating effects of carbon emissions and plastic pollution. There is little doubt at this point that contemporary human activity and climate change is linked. But what humans cause, humans might be able to undo.  In an effort to mitigate some of the damage of industrialization, various carbon trading schemes have been created. These schemes allow companies to offset their emissions by investing in projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere.  Read more: Ukraine to Use NFTs to Save Its Cultural ‘DNA’ Amid Russian Invasion  The problem with most carbon trading schemes is that they're often riddled with corruption and lack transparency. This is where Web3 comes in.  By using tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFT), it's possible to create a decentralized carbon trading system that is more transparent and less susceptible to abuse. Web3-native companies are using blockchain technology to tokenize carbon credits and make them available on a public ledger to encourage responsible corporate offsetting.  This not only makes it easier to track and verify carbon credits, but it also opens up the market to a wider pool of participants. As more companies are forced to offset their emissions, the demand for these tokens is likely to increase, leading to more investment in carbon-reducing projects.  Cultural heritage preservation with NFT marketplaces  The world's cultural heritage is under threat from climate change, war and economic inequality. The economics of cultural exchange, mainly driven by tourism, are oftentimes unfavorable to the communities involved and intermediaries end up capturing most of the value created. In order to preserve global cultural treasures for future generations, we need digital versions.  NFTs can be used to create verifiable and immutable records of tangible and intangible cultural artifacts. It might sound odd to “tokenize” a ceremony, language or any aspect of a local culture – but I mean it in the literal not proverbial sense.  Read more: How Traditional Artists Are Using Web3 to Meet New Audiences  Blockchains not only make it easier to keep track of these units of culture, but also enable people to share their art and insight with the world. NFTs are a powerful funding tool for charities and local communities, and uncensorable secondary markets (often with fairer, pre-programmed royalty distributions) mean communities can continue to benefit from cultural exchange in the crypto age.  As mentioned, markets are destroying so much of the world’s interesting and unique cultures, by incentivizing commodification and homogenization. But more efficient markets, backed by crypto, may help reverse the trend. Peer-to-peer finance ensures proceeds of trade go directly back to the community.  ReFi is a new funding vehicle for heritage that generates income and employment that directly benefits communities and artists working to create and protect this heritage and ultimately preserves this heritage for many generations to come.  The future of ReFi  As awareness of ReFi increases and more projects begin to adopt its principles, we are likely to see a wider range of applications for this transformative technology.  One area that is ripe for disruption is impact investing. Impact investing is a type of investment that aims to generate both financial returns and social or environmental impact.  With ReFi, it would be possible to create ""impact DAOs"" that invest in projects that have a positive impact on the world. These decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) could be used to finance everything from renewable energy projects to affordable housing initiatives. Web3 provides a new level of transparency and accountability, ensuring that the funds are distributed fairly to all parties involved.  Another area where ReFi could have a major impact is community governance. In many communities, decisions are made by a small group of people, often without input from the wider community.  With ReFi, it would be possible to give everyone a say in how their community is run. This could lead to more democratic and effective decision-making, as well as improved social outcomes.  The cryptocurrency world is often seen as a Wild West, full of scams and get-rich-quick schemes. As Web3 enters more mainstream channels, we have an opportunity to change that perception by using our skills and the available technology to shake out the status quo and build a better, more equitable world. And these are the degens that we hope to see winning.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Linda  Adami,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/15/the-next-step-in-the-evolution-of-web3-regenerative-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf479c62570f0a5ac3203d84a8cc4a6c7d1de9f4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As stated in a blog post about the matter, Binance periodically reviews the standards for a listing on the exchange. If a token no longer meets that standard, “we will conduct a more thorough review and potentially delist it,” Binance declared.

42407235,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJsWO,1671116258,The Art World Underestimates the Power of NFTs,"“Is it art? All of these people really amuse us, but the annoying thing is that none of them are worthy of the title ‘artist.’ It’s a con, a hoax, and endangering art history and the whole aesthetic tradition.”  What sounds like an argument during a debate in 2022 about non-fungible tokens was actually said in 1940 when gallerists were discussing an Art Brut display, a period in art history that is part of every museum collection today.  The art market of today sounds identical in their condemnation of NFTs and their characterization of these digital tokens as a fad, a bubble, a modern version of tulip mania. Obviously, the sudden collapse of the NFT market, the FTX hoax and the lack of education paired with the arrogance of crypto-bros doesn’t help to invite the art world to look beyond the money bubble.  Magnus Resch is a professor of art economics at Yale University. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 series.  But that’s wrong. Unlike common belief, NFTs are not art. Overpriced, celebrity-endorsed JPEGs that often are associated with NFTs will go away. But what stays is the technology to help authenticate artworks.  The current convergence of digital art, crypto money and blockchain technology will bring about a profound structural shift in the art ecosystem: Collectors won't buy if a work is not registered on the blockchain; artists will exert more control over their work and earn royalties from resales; more collectors will populate a transparent market and the art market will become more regulated, for the better.  Changing powers in the art eco-system  Let’s look at the role of artists: In the future, it is not unlikely that every artwork that leaves a studio will be registered by the artist on the blockchain. So when it’s traded the artist not only gets royalties but also knows who the new owner is. This allows them to work more independently and not rely on galleries entirely to promote or authenticate their works. As a consequence, artists will earn more on every piece they sell.  Traditionally, it’s been a 50/50 split with the galleries. In the NFT space, it’s a 90/10 split in favor of the artists. So, we will end up somewhere in the middle. Additionally, artists and their heirs will benefit from royalty income. Artists will also tap into new revenue streams. for example converting some of their community into paying members for additional services, unique content or early access.  Read more: The Different Types of NFTs: A Simple Guide  With this change in the commission set up, there will also be a change in the power structures: Similar to the entertainment industry in the 1930s, the power in the art world will shift from the distribution channel (galleries) to the creators (artists). And with more independence for artists also comes more responsibilities. In a world where collectors communicate directly with the artists, who is selling the works, then, when the artist is busy creating? In order to sustain this shift, artists will need to become more entrepreneurial and learn to manage new tasks. Some will hire more staff, others will gladly work with galleries that take on the jobs of selling, promoting, placing and supporting – roles galleries today are already performing. But the power dynamics will have switched.  Collectors will be most impacted by the development of the new art ecosystem. Given that the role of the middleman has shrunk, they will be in closer, more direct contact with artists. When every artwork is registered on the blockchain, collectors will feel more confident buying art because they will know current prices, past prices and comparable prices. And more collectors will enter the market because information on provenance has become clearer and more accessible. And selling artworks in the traditional market is currently very difficult and always requires a middleman. Using NFTs the sale process is much easier and allows for much faster transactions, demonstrating easier ways to get a return on investments.  Art market opposed to change  Does this mean the art market will change entirely tomorrow and all its key players will vanish? Definitely not, because changes in the art world take time. And because the inner sanctum of the art market will surely endure, relying as it does on established relationships. Does that, then, mean that Picassos will be replaced by Beeple and MFA programs will mostly graduate digital artists? Also, no. Painting is not dead, and digital art as a medium will continue to constitute a small share of the market. Only a few projects out of the current NFT hype are likely to make it into the top museums. Most will resume their pre-bubble relevance.  The advantages of NFTs and blockchain technology will contribute to a better art market, one that is fairer and more equal and democratic. A market that is more inviting, less exclusive and more transparent – converting a large number of new visitors into buyers who purchase art.

42407232,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJsT5,1671115998,Self-Custodial Onboarding Will Be the Norm in Web3's 2023,"Let’s face it, crypto still has a reputation problem and, as of now, rightfully so – but 2023 is the moment to change that at a root level. Recent events have only accentuated a lack of trust in the space from both businesses and consumers. The worst part is that this has been due to counterparty risk, a problem that crypto is meant to bypass by design.  Paulina Jóśków is the head of partnerships at Ramp. This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 package.  In 2023, Web3 projects will take on the responsibility of educating new users on self-custody and creating better gateways for them to enter the space safely. All the necessary tools are already available, market sentiments are temporary, and the fundamentals are still sound.  Counterparty risk is unnecessary  “Counterparty risk is the probability that the other party in an investment, credit, or trading transaction may not fulfill its part of the deal and may default on the contractual obligations.” (“Counterparty Risk.” U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 2022.)  This type of risk can only exist within centralized infrastructure. It will usually happen when a custodial service becomes insolvent or goes out of business, leaving its customers unable to access their funds.  Time and again we’ve seen how different kinds of custodial services have turned this risk into a reality. From Mt. Gox in the early days of crypto, to FTX, Celsius Network and Three Arrows Capital, they all failed to deliver on their obligations towards users – and not just any users. Many of those affected were newcomers to the space who simply weren’t aware that self-custodial alternatives are available.  See also: The 4 Horsemen of the Cryptocalypse  In decentralized finance (DeFi), counterparty risk is solved with code, and self-custody is the norm to make sure users aren’t vulnerable when those in charge of these services are being reckless. This is why the ethos of decentralization will remain central to the space’s development in 2023. If decentralized infrastructure and self-custody were the default mode for how new users are welcomed to the space, maybe crypto would have a different reputation.  Yet, here we are  There is currently no reason for the entry points into crypto and Web3 to be plagued by this problem. Self-custodial on-ramps are already working with countless dapps and wallets so that users are in complete control of their digital assets from onboarding to off-boarding.  Yet, most users still make their first digital asset purchase through a custodial service. This is simply because of their familiarity with existing Web2 banking and fintech applications. They assume crypto on-boarding works similar to any other online banking operation where the user journey is one of just signing up and trusting the people running the server with their assets.  What they don’t always understand is that they do not actually own their assets in these cases, and most of these services do not operate under the same legal guarantees and protections that a traditional financial firm would.  Unlike a bank, custodial services in crypto are not insured and many are registered off-shore. In the event of a hack or bankruptcy, it's very likely that users lose all their assets and no customer service representative will answer to explain what happened. Some custodians have built their businesses on the back of this information asymmetry.  Self-custodial onboarding as the new standard  More education around existing decentralized infrastructure and self-custodial onboarding is the first step in solving this problem. A shift towards DeFi is something that even custodians such as large centralized exchanges have acknowledged will happen once the knowledge gap among end-users is bridged. In the new year, this process will be accelerated in order to effectively address the current mistrust in the industry.  Projects that provide users’ first interactions with the crypto space are uniquely positioned to point new entrants towards best practices and make sure they’re not exposed to any unnecessary risks. Besides educating users on their particular use cases, they should emphasize the need for self-custody and make sure they know how to stay in control of their assets at all times.  See also: Worried About a Financial Crisis? Enter – Self Custody.  By making sure that users have self-custodial onboarding options easily available from within their own services, Web3 projects can help the industry rise to safer standards.  There are also practical user experience (UX) improvements that come from an industry-wide focus on self-custodial onboarding. Once users work with one of these services and pass the necessary verification processes, they’re able to purchase crypto with fiat from a variety of other dapps that have integrated that particular self-custodial onboarding solution.  Another improvement is around privacy. Unlike traditional exchanges, the business model for these on-ramp services doesn’t revolve around data collection and the monetization of it. Many eliminate instances where users are required to share any kind of data. This allows for greater risk mitigation related to hacks and data leaks and means that the space stays true to one of its core promises.  These are all things that every new user should and will know as Web3 continues to evolve in 2023.

The fund manager launched new bitcoin and ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETF) that began trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Dec. 16, according to a press release. They will be the first listed bitcoin and ether futures ETFs available in Asia, according to CSOP.  The launch is notable since the Chinese government officially banned crypto trading and mining in September 2021, though Hong Kong currently maintains an autonomous financial and legal system. The two new funds will be actively managed to invest in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group)-listed bitcoin and ether futures to track their respective prices.  “The approval of two new ETFs based on CME Bitcoin and Ether futures marks an important milestone for the digital asset ecosystem in Asia,” said Tim McCourt, CME Group’s Global Head of Equity and FX Products, in a statement.  CSOP had previously launched Hong Kong’s first Metaverse ETF, which was listed on the HK Stock Exchange in February.  The first bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds in the U.S. were approved last year, and while a number of spot bitcoin funds have been submitted for approval to the SEC, none have been approved thus far.  ProShares' Bitcoin Strategy ETF, a bitcoin futures ETF launched in the U.S. last year, attracted more than $1 billion during its first two days of trading at the height of the bull market. In the year since it launched, the ETF has attracted inflows of $1.8 billion, and outflows of $619 million despite the underlying value of bitcoin declining by nearly 70% in the same time period.

42411291,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMiqX,1671112800,The FTX Meltdown Calls for Higher Standards in Crypto Journalism,"The law is catching up with Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), co-founder and former CEO of collapsed crypto exchange FTX.  The whole situation has led to a loss of trust in the cryptocurrency industry, which needs to be addressed by financial advisors.  If there is a bright side to this mess, it’s that the traditional finance (Tradfi) industry has managed itself through these types of crises regularly over the past century. Memories of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the massive Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme still loom large in the industry.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Now FTX’s bankruptcy is rippling through the crypto industry and impacting other major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Can any of these exchanges be trusted as a place to store crypto?  The best answer we have right now is probably “maybe.”  We’ve talked about the issue of trust in the crypto space – that it’s hard for advisors to tell clients where to store their crypto because there is no one perfect answer for everyone. It’s hard to know which service providers to trust.  Well, that concern about trust applies equally to crypto journalism, as we have lately been thrown into doubt over whose advice to take.  Crypto journalism and trust  When CoinDesk published a piece by Ian Allison revealing problems with the FTX balance sheet and tipped off the entire meltdown, it provided perhaps one of the better examples of independent journalistic reporting. CoinDesk’s parent Digital Currency Group (DCG) also owns crypto trading firm Genesis, which was forced to halt withdrawals and thrust under regulatory scrutiny following the FTX collapse.  But a recent turn of events has revealed that journalism in crypto has also contributed to increasing distrust. A great example is the revelation over the past week that Bankman-Fried was secretly the financial backer of The Block, another cryptocurrency news publication.  Those of us journalists covering crypto know that finding and delivering trustworthy information in the industry has been hard enough to begin with.  Crypto journalists have already had to contend with the most aggressive financial marketing blitz of the last 20 years as startups and incumbents alike tried to capture some of the benefits of the crypto gold rush. So while many of us searched in earnest for good sources to share information on a very new and sometimes arcane phenomenon, we have had to sort through the people talking about their own book and looking for free advertising space to pitch their product.  We’ve also had to deal with conflicts of interest. Crypto publications are supported by advertisements of crypto companies, naturally. But in the traditional news industry there is typically a strict separation between the editorial content and what is advertised.  You may notice that the websites you read my material on are supported by advertiser dollars – but those dollars don’t impact what I write or what I get to cover. Nothing should be able to stop a good journalist from being a truth-teller and a tireless pursuer of fact.  Political implications of mistrust  Bankman-Fried has had tendrils that wrapped around so many entities within and outside of the digital assets industry – it’s hard to tell what’s legitimate anymore.  It seems that even those of us working in the margins of the cryptocurrency industry are going to be directly impacted by the avalanche of distrust that Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX have set off.  The revelation of Bankman-Fried's funding of CoinDesk competitor The Block comes at a time when trust in the media is at an all-time low, especially online where the depths of social media censorship and cooperation with public and political officials are only now being seriously plunged.  But SBF’s influence didn’t stop there. On Tuesday, a federal indictment was unsealed in New York alleging that FTX client funds were used to fund the campaigns of recently elected public officials from both major parties, in hopes of influencing the future direction of crypto regulations.  Nevermind that we’re also in an era of declining trust in elections and public institutions that has led to civil unrest at the U.S. Capitol in recent years.  A word of caution  As we come to the end of a tumultuous year, it’s still very hard to know who is really a truth-teller in the crypto industry right now, even for those of us trying to cover the industry.  When information is tainted by questionable actors like Bankman-Fried, the deliverers of information are rendered less worthy of trust.  This issue of misinformation is especially important to keep in mind as an investor in the crypto space. Nowhere is misinformation better reflected than in cryptocurrency prices.  While we’ve discussed some of the fundamentals behind various crypto tokens – like the network effect and processing power – the main driver of token prices is human sentiment, and human sentiment is flawed and easily misled.  Is bitcoin really worth $17,800? Is ether really worth $1,300?

Web3 domains have seen a surge in registrations over the past few months. With Unstoppable Domains, users can connect their crypto wallet addresses to a .crypto domain name, in the same way that internet users type .com or .gov into a browser to access websites' numeric Internet Protocol addresses.

OpenZeppelin, the firm behind the Forta network, will audit smart contracts, monitor vulnerabilities and alert for potential threats to the metaverse.  Stephen Lloyd Webber, developer advocate at OpenZeppelin, told CoinDesk that proactively observing and identifying vulnerabilities is key to enforcing security within a decentralized ecosystem. He noted that waiting to catch threats will only lead to their discovery after the damage has already been done.  “The pieces that make up a metaverse puzzle are intricate and extensive and there is a lot to keep an eye on,” said Webber. “The practice of auditing has proven essential in deploying existing Web3 services.”  The conversation around security in the metaverse grew more urgent this year following a $625 million exploit of metaverse game Axie Infinity’s Ronin network in March. According to data from blockchain security company Peckshield, about $760 million in crypto was stolen by hackers in October alone.  Sebastien Borget, chief operating officer and co-founder of The Sandbox, told CoinDesk that onboarding OpenZeppelin will not only increase the security of the smart contracts within the game, but will continue to pinpoint vulnerabilities to ensure its safety as it continues to build.  “With over 4.3 million registered wallets, The Sandbox is a major actor in Web3 democratization,” said Borget. “OpenZeppelin’s security services help build a reliable framework and reinforce trust in our ecosystem, a key factor in onboarding more newcomers to our platform and to Web3 as a whole.”",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/15/the-sandbox-onboards-security-firm-openzeppelin-to-protect-its-platform-from-attacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d16f2ed99f09f6449b560ffa348981ff7dfd0014-1846x1038.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388407,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREr93,1671112629,Perplexing Tranquility? Bitcoin's Implied Volatility Hits Lowest Since October 2020,"There is an uncanny sense of calm in the bitcoin (BTC) market despite lingering FTX contagion fears and macroeconomic uncertainty. Analysts are scrambling to explain the perplexing tranquility.  Bitcoin's annualized seven-day implied volatility (IV), or the options market's forecast of a likely movement in the underlying asset, has declined to a two-year low of 38.2%, according to data source Amberdata.  The metric – often equated with the degree of uncertainty or fear – peaked at 145% on Nov. 9 and has been falling since, even as the FTX contagion spreads and experts fear a wave of miner bankruptcies.  To Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, the declining volatility is not surprising.  ""Volatility expectations will continue to drop. Lower volatility is one of my favorite trades for 2023,"" Thielen told CoinDesk. ""The macro outlook is extremely constructive, with inflation falling like a rock and the recent decline in oil making the Ukraine war less relevant.""  Thielen added that the FTX headlines will now have less impact on the market, with investigations doing the dirty work in the background and cited China's recent decision to relax inflationary COVID-19 restrictions as a source of downward pressure on implied volatility.  Negative headlines have had less impact on bitcoin's price of late. The cryptocurrency has risen 9% to $17,700 since crypto lender BlockFi filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 28. Dominant crypto exchange Binance’s health came under extra scrutiny early this week, with clients withdrawing large sums of their coins. Bitcoin has managed to eke out 3% gains for the week.  Perhaps traders have moved on from the FTX collapse, having bought options to hedge their exposure following the FTX debacle, pushing implied volatility higher at that point.  ""Market participants have already hedged contagion implications, which are still relevant, but the hedging occurred when the market was in a more fearful state, leading the hedging costs to grow,"" Vetle Lunde, research analyst at Arcane, said.  ""The current low IV regime reflects that traders are satisfied with the current exposure (hedges already in play) and expectations of less volatility in the foreseeable future,"" Lunde noted.  Options activity picked up pace in mid-November as traders bought ether, solana and bitcoin put options to hedge downside risks, while users with funds locked on FTX switched to trading futures on other exchanges.  Or maybe crypto traders have just had their fill of 2022 already.  Volumes in both spot and derivatives markets have crashed since then, indicating market stagnancy. That's typical of the pre-holiday season lull.  Institutional interest has dwindled, as evidenced by the decline in active bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The so-called futures open interest has dropped to 69,000 contracts, the lowest since October.  The share of non-exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the open interest has hit an all-time low of nearly 41%.  ""In the light of muted activity and expected slow times ahead, it's likely that volatility will continue to compress, which in turn is reflected in options,"" Lunde said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/15/perplexing-tranquility-bitcoins-implied-volatility-hits-lowest-since-october-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e42fbe44f7209b7d4e21cec57d07817076dd2879-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) have introduced a bill to crack down on money laundering and financing of terrorists using cryptocurrencies. If it becomes law, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would bring know-your-customer rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners and prohibit financial institutions from transacting with digital-asset mixers, which are tools designed to obscure the origin of funds.  Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest continues to buy on Coinbase’s dip, adding $3.2 million of the crypto exchange’s shares to its portfolio. The investment firm now holds 5.8 million shares. This comes on top of two recent purchases, as the fund increases its holdings of the stock while the share price hits all-time lows. Year to date, the stock is down nearly 84%, underperforming bitcoin, which is down 61%. ARKK is down 64%.  PayPal is integrating its buy, sell and hold crypto services with the MetaMask wallet. The partnership between the payments firm and MetaMask developer ConsenSys is intended to enable users to select their PayPal accounts as a payment option to buy ether on the MetaMask app. MetaMask hopes the offering will help bring more users into the Web3 ecosystem at a time when the sector is looking for a way forward during the crypto winter.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows correlations between the year-over-year change in the price of bitcoin and backward-looking inflation measures like the Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index, forward-looking metrics like University of Michigan inflation expectations, the five-year break-even rate, the M2 money supply and S&P 500 and Case-Shiller housing index.  The yellow areas show correlations between changes in bitcoin's price and forward and backward-looking inflation indicators and assets like gold and the S&P 500.  Bitcoin closely tracks inflation expectations and appears to be negatively correlated to core CPI, real estate prices and M2 money-supply changes.  ""Bitcoin changes are leading changes in realized CPI inflation and appear to be more correlated to changes in inflation expectations,"" analysts at Deutsche Digital Assets wrote in a deep dive published early this month.  – Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Crypto Lending Platform Maple Finance Unveils Major Overhaul, Stops Lending on Solana  The Year Crypto Yields Blew Up  FTX Bankruptcy Court Is Warned Against Granting Bahamas 'Dangerous' IT Access",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/15/first-mover-americas-crypto-money-laundering-bill-on-the-table,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/896782158425c31001f342ca0cba7f45244984e9-720x449.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

5655255,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512452,1671109253,Why This Bitcoin Bearish Divergence Could Spell Doom For BTC Rally,"A quant has explained how this bearish divergence in Bitcoin on-chain data can lead to a short-term correction in the price. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Been Slowing Down Despite Price Going Up As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a gap has been forming in the purchasing power of short-term holders and the BTC price. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR), which tells us whether investors in the Bitcoin market are selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the overall market is realizing some amount of profit currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the average holder is seeing some loss at the moment. Naturally, the indicator at exactly equal to 1 implies the investors are just breaking-even on their investment. Related Reading: Ethereum Active Addresses At Highest Since May 2021, Good News For ETH? The “short-term holder” (STH) group is a Bitcoin cohort that includes all investors who bought their coins less than 155 days ago. The STH SOPR thus measures the profit ratio of selling being done by these holders. To properly assess the behavior of this group, the analyst is using a “rate of change” (ROC) oscillator for the indicator. Here is a chart comparing this momentum oscillator with the BTC price over the last few months: Looks like the metric has been going down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph shows, the ROC of the Bitcoin STH SOPR had been in deep red when the FTX crash took place, suggesting that these investors capitulated during it and realized a large amount of loss. However, as the BTC price has slowly improved from the lows, the ROC has become green. This implies that the STHs who bought during the lows have been selling for profits, leading to a rising SOPR. Bitcoin has continued to see an uptrend recently, but strangely, the STH SOPR ROC has been dropping off. This could be a sign that not many STHs were able to buy during these lows, hinting that their purchasing power is low at the moment. If they had been buying through this rally, they would have continued to harvest more and more profits as the price goes up, but that has clearly not been the case.

42388406,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREqzh,1671108815,CryptoQuant: On-Chain Data Shows Crypto Exchange Binance Isn't Exhibiting ‘FTX-Like’ Behavior,"Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume traded, is not the next FTX, according a report from CryptoQuant.  The Seoul-based analytics firm points to on-chain data to support claims made in a recent audit that Binance is overcollateralized.  “At the time Binance’s Proof of Reserves report was conducted, CryptoQuant’s estimate of Binance’s BTC reserves (liabilities) was 591,939 BTC. This compares to the PoR report’s Customer Liability Report Balance of 597,602 BTC. We can see that CryptoQuant data covered 99% of Binance's liabilities,” CryptoQuant wrote, using the ticker symbol for bitcoin. Collateralization is 101% when taking the exchange's assets and debtors into account, it said.  Binance is not experiencing the same volume of outflows that FTX had in the days before its collapse, CryptoQuant wrote, citing on-chain data. While withdrawals have increased, they are small compared with the exchange’s overall reserves. In a tweet, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said he “welcomes the stress test.”  Binance’s bitcoin reserves are up 4% since FTX's collapse, CryptoQuant wrote. Reserves for ether and stablecoins are down 6% and 15%, respectively.  CryptoQuant points out that Binance differs from FTX-Alameda in how ""clean"" the reserves are, or, to put it another way, how they're not reliant on the exchange’s proprietary token, BNB. A CoinDesk report that showed FTX sister company Alameda Research was materially backed by the exchange's FTT token kicked off a liquidity crisis that ultimately led to its bankruptcy.  For Binance, CryptoQuant says 88.95% of its reserves are clean. That compares with 56% for Huobi, 66.5% for Bitfinex, 81.64% for Kucoin, 97% for Crypto.com and 100% for OKX.  Data from Nansen pegs Binance’s total reserves at $57.4 billion versus $3.04 billion for Huobi, $2.47 billion for Kucoin, $3.36 billion for Crypto.com, and $6.67 billion for OKX. Nansen doesn’t have data for Bitfinex.  CryptoQuant says that Binance’s level of clean reserve is “acceptable.”  Trust on-chain  While there have been some questions about the financial health of Binance, Hochan Chung, CryptoQuant’s head of marketing, points to the availability of on-chain data to corroborate all claims, even if you don’t trust the exchange’s published report.  “Proof of reserve provides a real-time, transparent, and non-manufactured data, which is the first-time ever in the history of the financial market. The data is self-audited through blockchain technology,” he said in a Telegram message.  What on-chain data can’t account for is corporate control. FTX was known for lavish spending on employee perks, such as luxury apartments for staff, a generous DoorDash allowance for food delivery, and a chartered aircraft to fly Amazon deliveries to the Bahamas from the U.S.  ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" FTX’s new CEO, John J. Ray III, who was also involved in cleaning up Enron’s mess, said in a court document. ""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.""  Hal Schroeder, a former Financial Accounting Standards Board member and Rutgers University professor, told the Wall Street Journal that the audit Binance presented doesn’t comment on the quality of Binance’s internal controls.  “In light of what we’ve seen in the Bahamas, I don’t want to conclude that all the systems are that good,” he said.  Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann recently tweeted corporate travel at company is more austere than at FTX.  “Binance literally booked me at a Citadines ($83 a night) the last time I traveled to our Paris office. Sign of a company founded during a bear cycle. No mansions, but I have a fun job without fear of the company being mismanaged,” he said.

42388398,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREqgz,1671103735,Incoming FCA Chair Calls Crypto Firms Like FTX 'Deliberately Evasive',"Crypto firms like FTX are ""deliberately evasive,"" the incoming chair of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Ashley Alder, told the Parliament's Treasury Committee in a meeting on Wednesday.  Alder told the committee that he will be starting with the U.K. financial regulator on Feb. 20. Alder is currently the CEO of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). When he starts at the FCA, he will work alongside FCA CEO Nikhil Rathi and will ensure that the FCA's strategy is formulated clearly and well understood, its website said. He will also be able to challenge Rathi on how the FCA is run.  ""They [crypto firms] are a method by which money laundering happens at size,"" Alder said.  Crypto firms have been facing increased scrutiny lately following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which was the third-largest exchange at one point. Even Binance, which is currently the biggest exchange with a volume of over $7 billion according to CoinGecko data, is being investigated for alleged money laundering violations and could face criminal charges.  The FCA is currently registering crypto companies so that they can operate in the country and comply with its anti-money laundering rules. the regulator hopes to get more powers to regulate the crypto sector and ensure consumers are protected once the Financial Services and Markets Bill passes but currently warns people that they should be prepared to lose all their money when investing in crypto.  “We expect all authorized and registered firms to have appropriate systems and controls to counter the risk of being misused for financial crime. We have seen too many financial crime red flags missed by the crypto asset businesses seeking registration with us for anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing purposes,"" an FCA spokesperson said to clarify its current stance on crypto. ""We work with crypto firms to help them understand our expectations, and if they can meet the conditions for registration, we will register them. Forty crypto firms have gained registration and shows these standards are achievable.”  Hong Kong, where Alder currently resides, moved in May last year to put in place strict licensing rules for crypto firms that meant they can't serve retail clients.  ""I think more importantly from a public's perspective, is that the way in which they bundle a whole set of activities which are normally segregated, in conventional finance gives rise to massively untoward risk,"" Alder said at the meeting talking about crypto firms.

5649110,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512427,1671102048,Bitcoin Price Poised To Continue Its Rally As Whales Turn Bullish After 14 Months,"The bitcoin price has seen a minor rally ahead of yesterday’s FOMC meeting and has held relatively strong despite the hawkish outlook from the US central bank. A look at the daily chart of BTC shows that the price managed to hold above $18,600. After an exuberant euphoria following the release of CPI data, bitcoin seems ready for a consolidation phase for now. In the daily chart, the bitcoin price was rejected at $18,220. Therefore, it seems likely that bitcoin will go through consolidation for now and look for a higher low. The support area to hold is currently at $17,200 to $17,400. Are Bitcoin Whales Signaling A Trend Reversal? As on-chain data provider Santiment writes in an analysis, bitcoin’s fundamentals are looking extremely strong. Santiment pays particular attention to the shark and whale addresses, which hold between 100 and 10,000 BTC and are a notoriously important indicator of future price trends. Santiment reports that shark and whale addresses have spent $726 million buying BTC in the last 9 days. In addition, 159 new addresses with a value between 100 and 10,000 BTC have been added in the last three weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Explodes Around $18K Level, As Fed Reveals 50 Basis Point Rate Increase In total, there are currently 15,848 addresses holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC. In comparison, there are currently 43.46 million smaller bitcoin addresses, which means that sharks and whales account for 0.0364% of the total BTC addresses. The increase in shark and whale addresses is the fastest growth in 10 months, according to Santiment. Remarkably, this comes at a time when market sentiment is at its lowest in a long time following the FTX bankruptcy and Binance FUD. In the chart below, Santiment shows the behavior of the largest bag holders of BTC, USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI. And as can be seen, all lines have been rising massively recently, while the BTC price has continued to fall. As Santiment elicits, the big players have been slashing and dumping their bitcoin holdings for the past 14 months. Prices have fallen in lockstep with these dump-offs. Now, however, there are signs of a reversal in the trend: However, we may be seeing a turnaround now. Not necessarily with prices just yet… but at least with whales finally accumulating rather than dumping. Whales Stock Up Their Dry Powder The bitcoin metrics are not the only things pointing to a turnaround, but also the stablecoin movements. “[W]e have just seen massive sudden jumps in the key $100k to $10m USDT and BUSD wallets worth $100k to $10m,” Santiment said. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crystal Ball – What Happens To BTC After Christmas 2022? Key Tether addresses have accumulated $817.5 million (+7%) more purchasing power in the last 3 days, and BUSD key addresses have accumulated $104.9 million (+9%).

On Dec. 6, Telegram announced that users can purchase an anonymous number on the Telegram founder's Fragment blockchain by paying Toncoin. Users can then utilize the unknown number to sign up for Telegram, bypassing the need to use a SIM card to apply for the service as previously required. Other end-to-end messaging applications like Signal and WhatsApp still require users to use their own mobile numbers.  TON has rallied 30% from $1.84 to $2.4 since the official announcement, with prices reaching as high as $2.8 at one point. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has gained a meager 4.5% during the same period, CoinDesk data show.  ""Toncoin rallied +39.3% last 1w upon the revelation of the Telegram App's latest update, which allows users to open accounts without registering their phone numbers – instead, users can maintain anonymity by logging in using blockchain-based numbers, which are on auction for TON on the Fragment Platform,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.  The no-SIM signup facility provides users with an added layer of privacy.  ""On Telegram, your phone number was never visible to strangers – our users control who can see their number and whether others are allowed to find them by their phone number. Today starts a new era of privacy. You can have a Telegram account without a SIM card and log in using blockchain-powered anonymous numbers available on the Fragment platform,"" Telegram said in the Dec. 6 announcement.  In addition to allowing users to purchase blockchain-based identities, the new feature also opened the doors for the auto-deletion of messages on a timer for new chats.  These features marked deeper integration of blockchain technology, as promised by Telegram's founder and CEO Pavel Durov on Nov. 30.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin rose early but later fell after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell damped enthusiasm stemming from a less-aggressive rate hike with hawkish comments.  Insights: Is Dr. Copper's recent upturn a positive sign for bitcoin?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 882.47 −3.1 ▼ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $17,811 +32.7 ▲ 0.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,308 −13.3 ▼ 1.0% S&P 500 daily close  3,995.32 −24.3 ▼ 0.6% Gold  $1,819 +5.2 ▲ 0.3% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.5% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Seesaws but Holds at $17.8K  By James Rubin  Bitcoin looked primed to continue its momentum this week before U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell damped investors' mood with a pointed reminder that the Fed was not finished with its monetary hawkishness even after lowering its latest interest rate hike to 50 basis points.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $17,811, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier. BTC had topped $18,300 earlier in the day following an unexpected slowing in November's inflation data and the Fed's anticipated dovish turn. But in a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) rate announcement, Powell returned to a months-long theme that rising prices presented the biggest threat to the economy.  “50 basis points is still a historically large increase and we still have some ways to go,” Powell said at a press conference following the FOMC statement.  Ether followed a similar pattern, rising earlier in the day before dropping to trade at $1,308, down about a percentage point from Tuesday, same time. Most other major cryptocurrencies were in the red, albeit not by much with UNI, the token of decentralized exchange Uniswap, and LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, falling 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank 0.33%.  Equity indexes troubled by Powell's comments closed down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 off 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Tuesday's consumer price index fell to 7.1%, lower than the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey.  The Fed's latest rate increase the federal funds target range to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years. Powell has signaled that the terminal rate – the peak rate for the current hiking cycle, expected sometime next year – will likely be over 5%. The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow and lend money.  Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) are introducing a bill to crack down on money laundering and financing of terrorists and rogue nations via cryptocurrency. The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would bring know-your-customer (KYC) rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners and prohibit financial institutions from transacting with digital asset mixers, which are tools designed to obscure the origin of funds.  Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted in an email that the current Congress, which is in its final weeks, is unlikely to pass the legislation, but that ""the Act would address some national security concerns as it requires crypto firms to play by the same rules that apply to banks and traditional firms.""

The increase is significant, given copper’s traditional link to economic health. Analysts often view copper as a proxy for growth, affectionately calling it “Dr. Copper” for its professorial ability to forecast trends. So copper doing well bodes well for the economy, which bodes well for bitcoin.  Markets have been looking favorably upon copper, with the price of its futures contract increasing 8% over the last three weeks. If historic relationships hold true, this trend would imply market confidence about U.S. economic prospects.  By contrast, bitcoin (BTC) has maintained a strong negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar index (DXY). Investors will be watching this index in the weeks ahead, particularly after the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) trimmed its interest rate hike to 50 basis points on Wednesday from its previous, more aggressive 75 bps increases.  Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was unexpectedly hawkish in his comments following the rate announcement, reiterating long-held concerns about inflation.  Will bitcoin follow Dr. Copper’s prescription or follow the lead of the U.S. Dollar Index? The upcoming weeks will be interesting to watch.
