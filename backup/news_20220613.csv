In a bullish breakout formation, prices could retest February 2022 lows. Past Performance of Dusk Network As the crypto market recalibrates, forcing asset valuation lower, the Dusk Network token is soaring and massively outperforming the USDT, BTC, and ETH. The DUSK crypto is up 45 percent on the last trading day versus the USDT. Meanwhile, it is up roughly 72 percent against BTC and ETH in the same period. Dusk Network Technical Analysis From the daily chart, there is a double bar reversal pattern reversing losses. The bullish bar of June 13 has high trading volumes and is engulfing.

The coin&apos;s rices are at a two-week high, above the middle BB, and around June 2022 highs. At spot rates, traders can buy the dip with safety nets at the middle BB at around $0.13. Deeper losses below this mark may reverse gains as the coin snaps back to the primary bear trend. On a more positive outlook, confirmation may trigger the next leg up that may lift the token soar to February 2022 lows at $0.18. What to Expect from DUSK?

Key technical points: The CTK market price consolidates for a month. The accumulation zone ranges between $0.74 and $0.91. The 24-hour trading volume of Shentu is $39.5 Million, indicating a hike of 350%. Past Performance of CTK The consolidation range between $0.74 and $0.90 contains the sideways trend in CTK prices for more than a month, with multiple fakeouts.

42397006,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAZMojy,1655153452,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Tumbles Most in 1 Year as Crypto Cracks Appear,"Bitcoin (BTC) suffered its largest price drop in a year as signs emerged that the steep correction in crypto markets is hurting big industry players and putting extreme stress on digital-asset projects.  As of press time, bitcoin was changing hands around $23,200, down 16% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, slumped 18% to $1,222.  The latest leg down came as the big crypto lender Celsius, which as recently as April claimed to hold at least 150,000 bitcoin, worth about $3.5 billion at current prices, halted withdrawals. (Nexo, another crypto firm, expressed interest in buying some of the platform's assets.)  It was a day of fast-moving developments and announcements that all seemed to confirm how bleak crypto markets are suddenly looking.  The overall market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell below $1 trillion for the first time since early 2021, with big losses in tokens including SOL and DOGE. Crypto-related stocks, led by MicroStrategy (MSTR), plunged.  Binance temporarily paused bitcoin withdrawals (reportedly due to technical issues). Crypto.com and the crypto lender BlockFi announced job cuts. Tron's USDD stablecoin wobbled off its $1 peg.  ""Sentiment for cryptos is terrible,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote Monday in an emailed briefing. ""Bitcoin is attempting to form a base, but if price action falls below the $20,000 level it could get even uglier.""  The pain in crypto mounted as traditional markets also came under severe pressure. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index tumbled 4% to a new low for the year. The biggest driver appeared to be renewed investor fears the U.S. Federal Reserve will have little choice but to tighten monetary policy aggressively to tamp down inflation, which is running at its hottest in four decades.  The next two-day Fed monetary policy meeting starts Tuesday, culminating Wednesday with a statement and press conference hosted by Chair Jerome Powell.

The violent sell-off contrasted with the price action for most of May, where bitcoin mostly stabilized around the $30,000 level.  But bitcoin is now in the throes of a seven-day losing streak.  Crypto fund investors not buying the dip  By Jimmy He  Investors pulled $102 million out of digital asset funds during the week through June 10, according to a CoinShares report. Some $57 million of the outflows were attributed to bitcoin-focused funds.  Ether-focused funds saw $41 million in outflows, bringing month-to-date outflows to $72 million and year-to-date outflows to $386.5 million. Blockchain-related equities saw outflows of $5 million.

Binance wrote that it was “repairing several minor hardware failures on wallet consolidation nodes earlier today, which caused the earlier transactions that were pending to be broadcast to the network after the nodes were repaired.”  The company said that “these pending consolidation transactions had a low gas fee, which resulted in the later withdrawal transactions – which were pointing to the pending consolidation UTXO - getting stuck and not able to be processed successfully.” (UTXO refers tounspent transaction output.)  In order to fix these issues, Binance said it had to “change the logic to only take successful UTXO from consolidation transactions or successful withdrawal transactions. This fix will also prevent the same issue from happening again.”  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao initially said the problem was expected to be fixed in 30 minutes, but Binance said it actually took three hours to address. The company emphasized that users could still withdraw bitcoin on other networks, and that deposits were unaffected.

The &apos;spent output profit ratio&apos; (or SOPR in brief) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling at a profit or at a loss right now. The metric works by looking at the on-chain history of each coin being sold to see what price it was previously moved at. If this last price was less than the current value of the crypto, then that particular coin has now been sold at a profit.

For 11 weeks now, sellers have been able to close the weekly candle below the opening price. And all this is happening at average volumes. Welcome to the comfortable and joyful world of cryptocurrencies in 2022. Sellers have managed to lower the price to the range of the previous historical low - $1200-$1400. If buyers are able to keep this range, there will be a chance to form a rebound of the ETH price with the first target of $1700. By the nature of this rebound, it will be clear whether buyers will have a chance to continue their growth wave and test the mark of $2500.

Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted Monday that the funding rate on the Binance exchange for betting against, or ""shorting,"" the Tron blockchain's native TRX token stood at negative 500%, a whopping rate that suggests many investors are clamoring to get into that trade. According to Sun, TronDAO “will deploy $2 billion to fight them.”  TronDAO said in a tweet that it added $650 million of USDC to its reserve.  Decentralized USD (USDD) is an algorithmic stablecoin on Tron, a multipurpose smart contract blockchain, which is supposed to keep a one-to-one exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. It relies on an elaborate, automated balancing mechanism that involves alternately creating and destroying units of USDD and TRX.  It is also collateralized by holding cryptocurrencies, such as TRX, bitcoin (BTC) and other stablecoins, including Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, in a standby fund known as the TronDAO reserve.  Its design is eerily similar to Terra’s stablecoin, UST, which lost its price peg and eventually imploded a month ago, wiping out $40 billion in market value.  Read more: 'Revolution' Promised by Tron's Justin Sun Looks Like Clone of Terra's Algorithmic Stablecoin  Cryptocurrencies dropped sharply on Monday as Celsius, a crypto lender, announced that it suspended all withdrawals and transactions to prevent a run on deposits. It is the latest sign of a liquidity crisis in crypto, driven by a worsening economic environment around the globe and central banks hiking interest rates and draining excess liquidity from the financial system in an attempt to fight persistently high inflation.  USDD fell to as low as 91 cents Monday morning on the crypto exchange KuCoin, indicating a 9% drop from its supposed peg, according to TradingView.  According to the official TronDAO website, USDD’s collateral stands at $2 billion, while USDD’s supply in circulation is $723 million, suggesting that it holds enough capital to prop up the stablecoin by using reserves to buy USDD.  At press time, USDD was changing hands around 99 cents but still had not recovered its dollar peg. TRX, the twin token of the stablecoin, dropped 17% in the last 24 hours.",NEGATIVE,TRX | USDD,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRX | USDD,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/13/trons-stablecoin-peg-to-dollar-wobbles-justin-sun-swears-to-deploy-2b-to-prop-up,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Those are identity, scalability, privacy, interoperability and UX (user experience).  A former poker player turned venture capitalist and philanthropist, Qureshi looks to blockchain as both a source of revenue and social good.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here  “The most important thing about crypto is permissionless innovation,” he said. “That’s the idea that you do not need to get a license or a business plan approved. You can just deploy a contract on-chain and it starts getting users.”  See also: Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi Is Still Optimistic in the Crypto Bear Market  And so, Qureshi says, even if crypto has problems, it might prove its utility by allowing anyone to innovate.  At Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, CoinDesk asked Qureshi to explain crypto’s growing pains, and how he thinks about its longstanding issues. Here’s what he said (the transcript has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity):  Privacy  When you think about privacy, everything you do in DeFi [decentralized finance] is viewable. We've gotten used to that in crypto, but that's not the way of the future. There will be some trade-off that we can make that is going to be similar to the kind of privacy we expect in the real world that would still give us the auditability that we care about and that makes DeFi, DeFi.  See also: Lunarpunks, Privacy and the New Encryption Guerillas  Interoperability  Right now, you're extremely aware of what chain you're on. You know if you’re on Solana or Avalanche or Ethereum. At some point in the future, almost without a doubt, you will have digital assets and you will interact with applications – and that will be your relationship with [the blockchain].  On the internet, you don't interact with this service or that service. You don't interact with Cloudflare, and you certainly don't give a s**t about TCP/IP. Your allegiance is to your application. So in the future, if you want to do yield aggregation, instead of just looking at Yearn, you’ll look at what's the best yield anywhere in crypto. It will just be like calling out to another server on the internet.  Scalability  The fastest blockchains do fewer than, like, 1,000 TPS [transactions per second] each. You can argue about the margin there, but the bottom line is that none of them do that much throughput today. And for us to really get to world scale, all blockchains need to be much faster, much more scalable and have a much higher throughput. That applies to rollups and the like, too.  You want to get to not just tens of millions of users but hundreds of millions of users. Further, we talk a lot about users but we don't talk much about access patterns. If you want access patterns that look anything like what people do in Web 2, you need much, much, much more scalability.  You could argue that bitcoin is the most used cryptocurrency because it has the most holders. I don't know the exact numbers, but something like 50% of Americans own crypto. I’d guess more than half [of those] only own bitcoin. And maybe there's one transaction those people, who likely bought BTC on an exchange, actually settle on-chain, if that, per year. If that's the case, the access pattern of someone using bitcoin is that one transaction.  But what's the access patterns of someone using the internet? I don’t know how many Google searches I make per day. So a Web 3 user is gonna result in many transactions per day.  Identity  The issue here is having an online identity that can be relied upon. Let's say I want to offer you credit – credit is about your identity, about who you are but also about my recourse. I can only offer you credit if I know that I have a path toward getting it back. If I don’t know who you are and you run away, I'm underwater immediately. There's no recourse.  Related here is bankruptcy. That’s a punishment that survives you and our relationship if you default on the debt. Bankruptcy is one of the most important innovations that we have made in capital markets. It’s very underappreciated in crypto. It’s the way you protect your remaining assets if you cannot pay back all your creditors and how credits can punish you into the future. You cannot do credit without the concept of bankruptcy. But in order to have that, you need Identity. Identity that persists.  See also: Who You Really Are: A Conversation About Pseudonymity With Default Friend  Identity is also important for things like marketing. People don't think about this very often, but when you sign up for Coinbase, they can tell whether you're institution or retail. If you’re retail, they throw a bunch of incentives and charge you an arm and a leg for every transaction. If you're an institution, they don’t have to pay anything to get on board, but they charge you BIPs [bitcoin improvement proposals] because you're price-sensitive. Brokerages make all their money from retail.  In DeFi, I can't tell whether you are retail or whether you are Jump [Crypto, the digital asset wing of the eponymous hedge fund]. The protocol treats everyone the same. A centralized exchange’s margin would f**king collapse. Imagine how much money could be made if DeFi businesses could know who their customers are. Nobody can do it today because there's no notion of identity.  We're investing in a company called Quadrata that allows you to selectively disclose parts of your KYC [know-your-customer] background. So you can selectively disclose your country or other parameters about yourself that you might want to prove to an application or business. This means you could KYC to receive an incentive, but may not have to.  UX  MetaMask, for instance, is not the most user-friendly way to transact. We've already seen some wallets start to do it much better, like Solana’s Phantom – great wallet experience. Keplr – great wallets. We've been able to learn from mistakes, and I think we're going to see more and more innovation.

The digital asset began deppeging from the U.S. dollar value and hinted at another catastrophic event in the crypto market, like the one experienced by Terra (LUNA) and its native stablecoin UST. Related Reading | TA: Bitcoin Dives 10%, Why BTC Could Even Break $25K At the time of writing, the value of TRON&apos;s stablecoin has been climbing back to its 1:1 parity to the U.S. dollar. Earlier, the digital asset started trending to the downside forcing the TRON DAO Reserve, the entity responsible for protecting USDD&apos;s peg, to deploy $2 billion. This created an increase in selling pressure for TRX which moved to the downside on the back of this event, and a crypto market already trending to the downside along with traditional investments.

Market moves: The crypto lender Celsius jolted traders with the news that it was pausing withdrawals due to ""extreme market conditions.""  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) suffered one of its worst price declines of the year, tumbling alongside ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies as a fresh wave of panic struck traders just one month after the Terra blockchain's meltdown.  As of press time, bitcoin was down 11% to about $23,900, extending a losing streak that has now stretched to seven straight days.  Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, plunged 16% to $1,232. The overall market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell below $1 trillion for the first time since January 2021.  The latest sell-off came as fears emerged of a new potential systemic threat to digital-asset markets, after the crypto lending service Celsius announced in a blog post that it was pausing withdrawals amid ""extreme market conditions.""  The price of Celsius' CEL token fell over 50% after the news came out.  Analysts also cited growing concern that the Federal Reserve may have to step up its campaign to tighten monetary conditions after a report Friday showed the U.S. inflation rate unexpectedly accelerating to a new four-decade high. Cryptocurrencies, like stocks, have come under harsh downward price pressure this year from the central bank's push to withdraw excess liquidity from financial markets.

Ice Cube Meets Dogecoin Team Over Dinner Ice Cube, an American rapper, founded the Big3 professional basketball league and decided to sell the team&apos;s rights using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Big3 league decided to sell 25 fire-tier NFTs, which gives owners control of the Killer 3s&apos; licensing, intellectual property (IP), and league-approved items. In May, Bill Lee, the founding chairman of MyDoge, a self-custodial Dogecoin wallet, purchased all 25 fire-tier editions of the Aliens, a Big3 team. Following the purchase, Big3 seems to have formed a partnership with the meme-based cryptocurrency by integrating the MyDoge wallet, which allows players, coaches, and teams to earn Dogecoin tips on Twitter. Additionally, the logos of MyDoge/Dogecoin will also be prominently displayed by the Aliens on team jerseys, events, and broadcasts. And now, in a recent meeting with the Dogecoin team, Ice Cube perhaps wants to take the adoption of the meme-based cryptocurrency up to a notch.

42415270,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRhNA,1655125855,"SOL, DOGE Lead Plunge in Major Cryptos as Traders Warn of ‘Severe Losses’ Ahead","Crypto markets lost some 12% in the past 24 hours amid a weak macroeconomic sentiment and systemic risk from within to reach market capitalization levels last seen in January 2021.  Bitcoin (BTC) slid 13% to under $25,000, its lowest in 18 months while ether (ETH) lost 18%. Dogecoin (DOGE) fell some 21%, and Solana’s SOL, Polkadot’s DOT, and XRP fell at least 16% in the past 24 hours.  The top hundred cryptocurrencies by market capitalization recorded average losses of 15%, data shows. Despite the drop, crypto futures only recorded $1 billion in liquidations – a relatively low figure compared with previously high liquidations when prices did not move as much. This suggests that the plunge was led by spot selling.  Weakness in cryptocurrencies came amid poor U.S. Consumer Price Index data for May released last week.  Inflation surged to 8.3% over the past year, the report said, causing traders to price in further rate hikes of more than 175 basis points by September, implying two half-point and one 75 basis-point hike, as per Bloomberg.  Such analysis led to a rout in global assets on Monday, with Asian stock indices ending the day 3.39% lower. Europe’s Stoxx 600 fell 2.2% since Monday’s start, and Germany’s DAX lost 2.18%. Futures in the U.S. opened lower. Technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 sunk 2.95% since Monday’s open, while S&P500 fell 2.33%.  Severe losses ahead  Traders said they expect crypto prices to continue to fall until market conditions improve.  “We could be facing even more severe losses moving forward. Economic growth is clearly slowing, and reports already suggest the U.S. could see a recession in the next year,” said Manuel Ortiz-Olave, co-founder at equity tokens firm Brickken, in an email to CoinDesk. “Higher inflation will continue forcing higher interest rates, and higher interest rates are also negative for economic growth.”  ""Some of the most important companies in the world like Apple [AAPL], Microsoft [MSFT] or Nike [NKE] have already reported slowdowns in sales, and Tesla [TSLA] has indicated that layoffs will come soon. These are clearly negative headlines, which combined with higher food and fuel prices, make people be careful about their savings,” Ortiz-Olave said, explaining that a slowdown in consumer spending would lead to a loss of revenue for major companies.  Meanwhile, possible systemic risk from within the crypto space contributed to the falling sentiment as crypto-lender Celsius paused withdrawals.  The company allows users to earn yields of more than 17% on their crypto holdings and cited “extreme market conditions” as one of the factors behind its decision. This led to severe criticism among market observers on Crypto Twitter.  Elsewhere, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to the Tron ecosystem deployed $2 billion in funding to protect against a possible fall in the prices of its TRX tokens.  “Funding rate of shorting #TRX on binance is negative 500% APR. Trondaoreserve will deploy 2 billion USD to fight them,” Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted. “Short squeeze is coming.”  Monday’s drop seemed to stabilize with bitcoin trading at just about the $24,100 mark at writing time.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE | SOL,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/13/solana-dogecoin-lead-plunge-in-majors-as-traders-warn-of-severe-losses-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90ab8c855892679e1571caaccb001cbf36a03a71-3868x2493.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Much of the bear case is priced in at current levels, which makes for an attractive entry point,” the Wall Street bank said in the report, initiating coverage of the stock with an ""overweight"" rating and a price target of $120 a share.  Silvergate’s stock was down over 17% in pre-market trading at $61.06, which is nearly half of Wells Fargo’s price target. Crypto-exposed stocks slumped on Monday as bitcoin (BTC) fell to an 18-month low amid poor macro sentiment and lending protocol Celsius stopping withdrawals.  Wells Fargo says the market is in the early stages of crypto and blockchain adoption, and Silvergate provides a regulated and FDIC-insured platform for investors looking to on-ramp and off-ramp U.S dollars into the crypto ecosystem.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a government agency that is tasked with maintaining stability and confidence in the U.S.’s financial system. It insures deposits and supervises large financial institutions.  “While crypto’s role in the financial ecosystem is still up for debate, what cannot be ignored is the wide scale adoption of crypto and blockchain products by some of the largest global institutions,"" the note said.  Companies such as JPMorgan (JPM), PayPal (PYPL), Block (SQ), Tesla (TSLA), Mass Mutual (MCI), CME Group (CME), ICE (ICE), Fidelity and Northern Trust (NTRS) have all began to embrace the concept of crypto, and some pension and mutual funds are allocating capital to the asset class, it added.  This institutional adoption is reflected in the growth in Silvergate’s digital customers, which has been expanding at a 35%-40% rate year on year since 2019, the bank said.  Silvergate has built a strong network effect via its Silvergate Network (SEN), which is used by some of the biggest exchanges and institutional clients in the digital asset space, it added.  The bank plans to roll out its own U.S.-based stablecoin payments platform in 2022 and this opens new potential revenue opportunities, the report said.

Crypto lending network Celsius suspended withdrawals, citing ""extreme market conditions."" The news sent bitcoin (BTC) lower by about $1,500 within minutes, a decline that has continued into Monday morning. Bitcoin is currently at an 18-month low of $23,900.  Business-intelligence software firm MicroStrategy is leading crypto-related stocks lower, down 25% premarket. A bitcoin price of $21,000 had been talked about as a point at which the company could face a margin call, but CEO Michael Saylor previously denied that, saying bitcoin would need to fall to about the $3,500 level before that would begin to become an issue.  At a price of $22,960, MicroStrategy would be down more than $1 billion on its bitcoin bet.  Coinbase is lower by 17.6% To $48.42, and now off 87% from its all-time high hit in November.  It's ugly for the miners as well, with Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Hut 8 (HUT) all sporting double-digit percentage declines.

Following the crash, algorithmic stablecoins have once again become a popular crypto topic. USN, a stablecoin native to an emerging public chain named NEAR, was launched almost at the same time as UST collapsed. The fall of UST showed this nascent stablecoin how the death spiral of an algorithmic stablecoin can engulf and destroy everything like a terrifying black hole, and users also wonder whether USN could avoid a similar ending in the future. About USN As the first NEAR-native algorithmic stablecoin, USN is soft-pegged to the US Dollar and backed by a Reserve Fund that contains collaterals such as NEAR and USDT. USN is positioned to be an effective way to bootstrap liquidity in the NEAR ecosystem while adding a new layer to NEAR&apos;s utility as a token. USN&apos;s core stability mechanisms consist of on-chain arbitrage and the Reserve Fund based on the Currency Board principle. Decentral Bank (https://decentral-bank.finance/), the DAO developing and supporting USN, manages the smart contracts of $USN and its Reserve Fund. The DAO can vote to stake the NEAR from the Reserve Fund and distribute the staking rewards to the users of protocols that integrate USN.

To facilitate the re-peg, he said that $2 billion in TronDAO reserves will be poured in to fight the Binance shorts funding rates. Funding rate of shorting #TRX on @binance is negative 500% APR. @trondaoreserve will deploy 2 billion USD to fight them. I don&apos;t think they can last for even 24 hours.

How Did Kwon Manage to Drain Funds? Numerous unconfirmed reports surfaced on Saturday that Do Kwon siphoned off $2.7 billion from the project before the collapse of both LUNA and UST in the crypto markets. In a Twitter thread by a Terra insider with affiliations to the Terra Research Forum, FatManTerra shared the alleged details on how Kwon managed to drain funds. FatMan alleges that Do Kwon had used Degenbox, a borrowing protocol in the Abracadabra ecosystem, allowing users to stake collateral to buy UST, put it into Anchor, then used the staked UST to borrow more UST, put it into Anchor once again, and so forth a loop, while artificially maintaining the liquidity. 🧵 Some of you thought $80m per month was bad. That&apos;s nothing. Here&apos;s how Do Kwon cashed out $2.7 billion (33 x $80m!) over the span of mere months thanks to Degenbox: the perfect mechanism to drain liquidity out of the LUNA &amp; UST system and into hard money like USDT.

Yet, the technology is already rapidly expanding, with new platforms constantly emerging into the brand new space. Within the metaverse, users can live in an alternate reality where they can buy their condos, socialize with others using their avatars, attend business meetings, and even earn an additional income stream. Here are a few of the top ways users can take advantage of the lucrative potential of the metaverse. Virtual real estate One of the fascinating new ways users can make money in the metaverse is buying NFT land for a fixed price and building on it or renting/selling it for a profit. Users can also rent the land out to developers so they can create buildings, gaming arenas, concert halls, offices, and other venues. Although virtual real estate can come at a high price, leasing a space can sometimes deliver profits similar to real-life real estate. Trade NFTs NFTs and the metaverse are closely connected since they both use blockchain technology, and the metaverse has given NFTs a new use case.

42415261,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRhHV,1655114378,Binance.US Accused of Misleading Investors in Class-Action Lawsuit Over Terra,"“Those of you waiting for the earth to become unstable – I'm afraid you will be waiting until the age of men expires.”  These confident words tweeted by Terra blockchain founder Do Kwon sought to convince crypto investors to put their trust (and money) into terraUSD (UST), a stablecoin that Kwon promised would always stay priced at exactly $1. Unfortunately, Kwon’s confidence was not enough to save UST and the rest of Terra as his entire project dropped to zero.  Now, over 2,000 Terra investors say false marketing is what caused them to lose their money.  In a class-action lawsuit filed Monday in The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, centralized cryptocurrency exchange Binance.US has been accused of misleading investors surrounding the Terra blockchain ecosystem.  The suit marks the first major U.S.-based court filing relating to Terra, whose UST and LUNC tokens wiped out around $40 billion in investor funds when they crashed to pennies last month.  The suit, which was filled by U.S.-based law firm Roche Freedman LLP, alleges that Binance.US marketed Terra’s dollar-based UST as more stable than it actually was. According to the suit, when UST and its sister token luna classic (LUNC) crashed to zero in May, thousands of unsuspecting retail investors were caught completely off guard. Misleading advertising is what the suit says is to blame for those losses.  The lawsuit also alleges that Binance.US is not registered as a broker-deal or an exchange, which may be in violation of securities law after it listed what might be an unregistered security in UST.  The suit is also aimed at Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder.  In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Kyle Roche, one of Roche Freedman's founding partners, said “Binance U.S. recklessly listed and promoted UST as a ‘safe’ stablecoin to those seeking to avoid the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. They, as well as other exchanges that listed UST, should be held accountable.""  Binance.US disputes the allegations made in the lawsuit. ""Binance.US is registered by FinCEN and adheres to all applicable regulations. These assertions are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously,"" the company said in a statement to CoinDesk.  While a successful suit would send chills down the spines of some decentralized finance (DeFi) founders and centralized exchange CEOs, it would embolden DeFi advocates who think decentralized tools for participating in crypto finance – rather than centralized exchanges – are necessary to avoid government censorship and burdensome regulations moving forward.  The Terra crash  Along with seasoned big-money backers like Hashed and Jump Crypto, the Terra collapse drained the wallets of thousands of unsuspecting retail investors. In the days following Terra’s decline, its largest Reddit forum was filled with accounts of suicides (and above them, extensive resources on how those struggling could find help).  The forum also featured criticism of Terra’s highly vocal co-founder – Do Kwon. Kwon, according to some Terra watchers, is primarily to blame for hyping up the promise that UST would always sit safely at $1. Just as he was making brash assurances around the security of UST, Kwon was building a system that onlookers like Kevin Zhou of crypto hedge fund Galois Capital said was built to fail.  Upon these questionable foundations, Kwon nonetheless promoted the safety of UST (and its luna sister token) ceaselessly across social media – loudly dismissing critics like Zhou. Even as UST first began to wobble off of its $1 peg (just a few days before it ultimately crashed), Kwon tweeted “Anon, you could listen to CT influensooors about UST depegging for the 69th time, Or you could remember they’re all now poor, and go for a run instead.”  Deriding critics with adjectives like “poor” was not out of character for Kwon, but the founder was unusually silent for several days as his ecosystem eventually cratered.  The question now is whether Kwon or his company will ultimately join Binance.US in facing potential legal penalties for their role in promoting Terra.  A government panel is already awaiting Kwon in his native South Korea, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been nipping at Terraform Labs’ heels for years. Kwon has reportedly been living in Singapore for the last several months, but today’s lawsuit adds to the evidence that Kwon will soon face legal battles around the world.  Even so, Kwon’s Terraform Labs – which held a central role in creating the Terra ecosystem – has yet to face a class-action lawsuit like this one.  Apparently, it won’t have to wait for long.  According to FatMan – a member of the Terra Research Forum and a vocal critic of Terra with a large Twitter following – a suit against Terraform Labs is also coming, and it is likely to look similar to this one.  FatMan helped orchestrate Monday’s suit by organizing a group of 2,000 aggrieved Terra investors who allege they were misled by a number of entities.  FatMan told CoinDesk: ""We will begin by filing mass arbitrations & class actions against the various exchanges. I will be helping them with some outreach (connecting to victims) but I have no real special role in the exchange suits. Then soon after we will file against TFL/Jump.""  On the Binance.US suit, they added: ""Centralized exchanges have become highly accessible to the general public – even my parents use them – and as such, it is virtually a moral imperative for them to uphold a high standard of truth and risk disclosure. Telling people an asset is fiat-backed when it is not is fraudulent.  ""Telling people a coin is 1:1 pegged to the US dollar and selling it alongside USDC and USDT without the relevant risk disclosures is scummy. People were roped in with siren calls of 'safe, stable yields' - but no attempt to help them actually understand what they were buying was made. This is morally unconscionable, and, in my opinion, it should be illegal.""  Looking ahead  Should the suit succeed, it will prove monumental in defining the legal status of DeFi, which has thus far avoided clear regulations or heavy government oversight.  Moreover, the fact that today’s suit seeks to hold a centralized exchange culpable for a token’s advertising – rather than the organization that launched it – will hold wide implications for the shape of DeFi moving forward. It may portend a world where centralized exchanges are forced to more closely vet the tokens they support on their platforms.

The 24-hour trading volume of Decentraland is $454 Million, indicating a hike of 65%. Past Performance of MANA The 70% downfall in Summer 2022 took support at the $0.67 mark to retest the $1.35 mark with a quick V-shaped reversal.

In a letter to Celsius Monday, Nexo said it was particularly interested in Celsius’s collateralized loan portfolio. Nexo publicized the letter, which didn't mention a price, in a tweet.  In a blog post earlier Monday, Celsius announced it would also pause its swap and transfer products. It did not provide a timeline for resuming withdrawals. The announcement comes on top of Celsius telling nonaccredited investors they could no longer transfer funds.  ""We are working with a singular focus: to protect and preserve assets to meet our obligations to customers,” Celsius said. “Our ultimate objective is stabilizing liquidity and restoring withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts as quickly as possible. There is a lot of work ahead as we consider various options, this process will take time, and there may be delays.""  The cryptocurrency market has slumped in recent weeks amid weakness in the macroeconomic environment. Bitcoin (BTC) has declined for almost 12 straight weeks, sliding from almost $49,000 in March 2022 to under $25,000. The total crypto market cap, which peaked at about $3 trillion in November, dropped below $1 trillion today, TradingView data shows.  In its letter, Zug, Switzerland-based Nexo said it was looking to acquire assets “mostly or fully of collateralized loan receivables secured by corresponding collateral assets, as well as brand assets and the customer database.""  In an audit earlier on Monday, Nexo said it had $6.2 billion in customer liabilities and held assets in excess of that amount.  The NEXO token price is down by 22% in the past 24 hours amid a market-wide sell-off. Celsius' CEL token has lost more than 50% of its value following its announcement.  Celsius, which is headquartered in New Jersey and has a subsidiary in London, had not responded to requests for comment by publication time.

Key technical points: The AKRO market price has increased 24.92% over the past 24 hours. The price jump sustains above the midline of Bollinger bands. The 24-hour trading volume of Arkopolis is $75.41 Million, indicating a hike of 95%. Past Performance of AKRO The technical chart of the AKRO/USD currency reveals a pause in the long-coming downtrend near $0.0030, resulting in a lateral shift in the price trend. Buyers, however, take advantage of the weakening selling pressure and push the trend upward to $0.0050. However, because of the higher price rejection, it is difficult for bulls to keep the market value over the psychological level. Source- Tradingview AKRO Technical Analysis AKRO prices showcase a lower price rejection in the daily candle, indicating a buying pressure ready to surpass the overhead resistance at $0.0060. Furthermore, the increase in trading volume supports the idea of a price jump. After a parabolic reversal in the bottom band at $0.0030, the Bollinger bands begin to rise in a rising channel. Furthermore, the price remains above the midline and finds support, suggesting that an upside extension is possible. In terms of technical indicators, the MACD and signal lines have avoided a bearish crossover with overnight growth and are approaching the zero line.

Who are they, and what is their impact on its global adoption? Wel. let&apos;s find out. Pro Crypto Presidents A few presidents have been quite vocal in their support of cryptocurrencies. They are- Nayib Bukele Perhaps no president has supported Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as much as the young and energetic president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. He&apos;s going as far as pushing for Bitcoin&apos;s adoption by other emerging countries, which shows how much of a supporter of the coin he is. He did so at the Alliance of Financial Inclusion (AFI), promoting its adoption to 32 central banks and 12 financial officials. He saw Bitcoin as the perfect solution to his country&apos;s financial woes back home. El Salvador became the world&apos;s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender officially. It was an unprecedented move that saw the legitimacy of cryptos and blockchain go through the roof. As legal tender, its usability was now at par with Central bank Issued Fiat currencies.

42394206,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZhKn,1655083333,How Much ETH Does Joe Lubin Hold?,"AUSTIN, Texas — How much ETH does Joseph Lubin, the founder of Ethereum incubator ConsenSys, hold? No one knows, and he’s not saying.  “No, I wouldn’t disclose that personally,” Lubin, once called the “Daddy Warbucks” of Ethereum, said on stage at Consensus 2022. The brilliant researcher at Galaxy Digital (and former CoinDesk alumna) Christine Kim was the latest person to pose that question to Joe on stage in Austin, Texas.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Indeed, Lubin’s holdings have never been more relevant as Ethereum nears the end of a multi-year development to overhaul its consensus algorithm. Proof-of-stake – the new security protocol, the heart of what these trust-minimization machines do – will secure the largest smart contract blockchain by market cap, Ethereum, by having people post collateral.  Or as Kim said, “Capital is what directly influences who can participate in building blocks, preposing transactions and creating network consensus.” In other words, what’s at stake is the prospect of Lubin controlling the world’s most used blockchain.  On stage, Lubin was “comfortable” saying his holdings have “never been even close to even half of a percent.”  This differs from previous estimates, which at one point placed Lubin’s ownership between 5% and 10% of the total circulating ether supply. Forbes cited those figures when naming him the second-richest person in crypto in 2018, and what U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler believes, though the data is almost assuredly out of date.  Lubin, who previously founded a quant hedge fund and served as Goldman Sachs’s (GS) vice president of technology, was with Ethereum from the beginning. He was likely one of the principal buyers of ETH during the network’s $18 million initial coin offering (ICO). It’s also likely he, as Ethereum’s chief operating officer, received a healthy cut of the estimated six million ether the Ethereum Foundation distributed to “early project contributors.”  But there are several complicating factors, like the fact that Lubin has spent the past five years funding, often out of his pocket, hundreds of Ethereum startups and open-source protocols through the venture studio ConsenSys. Lubin, though a committed ecosystem leader, has also probably liquidated ETH for fiat over the years.  “I’ve done nothing but disseminate the tokens,” Lubin said, adding, “I haven’t acquired any tokens since genesis.” (Ethereum went live in 2015 and was preceded by a “pre-mine” that pre-allocated 60% of its initial supply.)  Lubin cannot prove these claims unless he reveals all his alphanumeric blockchain addresses, which is akin to someone sharing their banking details. Though “openness” and “verifiability” are guiding principles of the digital asset industry, at a personal level, perhaps this is none of our business.  Lubin certainly influences Ethereum and is often thought of as a generous – if profligate – leader, benefactor and investor. Though former employees are suing him, is criticized for cozying up to JPMorgan (JPM) and nearly drove ConsenSys into the ground (after pursuing an investment strategy that was less “incubation” and more “throw a hundred eggs into the air”), his vision and capital is central to Ethereum.  Lubin has described ConsenSys – which initially raised no debt, took no investments and has nearly gone bankrupt – lovingly as a “global organism.” But it’s an organism that in its early days burned through a reported $100 million in cash per year. A significant percentage of its for-profit operations have failed, though it's also responsible for essential software like MetaMask that’s free to use.  See also: JPMorgan Wants to Bring Trillions of Dollars of Tokenized Assets to DeFi  New research from Kim at Galaxy shows that although highly centralized at the beginning, Ethereum’s supply has become more distributed. Analytics show that many of the accounts that received the most pre-mined ETH have sent a significant amount to centralized exchanges.  “Conversely, only 1.6 million ETH (~2.3% of the pre-mine supply) has been held unmoved,” she writes. Mining, the computational process that Ethereum is ditching, has also diluted the earliest user’s total supply, a process that will dramatically slow after the Merge’s switch to proof-of-stake.  “From what I know, I have zero concern that there’s any sort of concentration amongst the original owners,” Lubin said.  A less equal distribution of capital within Ethereum has long been a bugbear of critics who see it as a measure of fairness. But once secured by proof-of-stake, these figures will directly impact Ethereum’s censorship resistance or credible neutrality.  Theoretically proof-of-stake security allows anyone to contribute toward and get paid for network validation, (unlike under proof-of-work which requires a significant amount of capital upfront to buy specialized computers called miners).  But third parties have already emerged and capitalized on staking, partly because becoming a validator costs 32 ETH. Crypto exchanges Coinbase (COIN), Kraken and Binance account for just over 20% of total staked ETH, Kim wrote. While Lido, a so-called liquid staking protocol, was an early mover in the space allowing for incremental ETH deposits, it is now “the single largest controlling entity of staked ETH.”  See also: Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Questions SEC Investigation into BNB  Lido’s staked ETH token is now trading at a 5% discount to ETH, partly because it functions like a bond exchangeable for an asset at par at a later date. But amid a market down cycle, there are also potential liquidity concerns and implications for protocols like Celsius that have collateralized their holdings using Lido and may not be able to fully redeem their customers’ funds.  Concentration among stakers is a much deeper issue than the question of Lubin’s holdings. In proof-of-stake systems, capital will generate more capital if it’s put up for stake, meaning that the network will primarily reward those that already have the most.  “ConsenSys is a new kind of business, it takes in thousands of different tokens in our work,” Lubin said. “We’re doing our best to accumulate ether tokens in advance of this thing called the Merge … which we’ll just assume is going to go well.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/06/13/how-much-eth-does-joe-lubin-hold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4594fbffc957f6352f0b98190c6c365369773162-3557x2668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Chainlink LINK −10.9% Computing Cardano ADA −10.8% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −9.3% Smart Contract Platform  Bitcoin Falls and Then Falls Some More  Still stinging from Friday's inglorious U.S. consumer price report that showed inflation rising, crypto investors spent much of the weekend in a defensive crouch.  Bitcoin was recently trading around $26,700, off more than 8% since late Friday. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had been lingering around $30,000 for a month.  Altcoins were harder hit, with ether falling to its lowest level in more than 14 months. The second-largest crypto by market cap was recently trading at roughly $1,450, off more than 15% over the weekend. Ether had spent much of the past month at roughly $1,800. AVAX and AXS were each recently down by over 20% since Friday. The price plunges underscored investors' risk wariness – the more risky the asset, the more wary.  ""Altcoins have historically underperformed BTC during bearish phases, and currently they have the added pressure of potential regulatory roadblocks given the nature of their issuance, especially via token sales and such,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull, wrote to CoinDesk. ""Only a small number of altcoins can realistically survive such market movements and even fewer are likely to see previous all time highs in terms of price.""  Cryptos' declines tracked equity markets, which plummeted Friday after the latest CPI, which some observers thought would tick slightly better for consumers, rose to 8.6% annually, a more than 40-year high that suggested rising prices would be around for awhile. The tech-focused Nasdaq plunged 3.5%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were off over 2.5%.  In the CPI, airline fare prices jumped over 12%, a result of rising fuel prices that have worsened since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. U.S. gasoline prices topped $5 per gallon, and as demand increases during the traditional summer travel season, seem likely to ripple not only through family budgets but businesses who must now factor in additional fuel costs into their pricing. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index plunged more than eight points to its lowest level in 14 years, with more than half of those individuals surveyed tying their opinions to rising prices.  Investors are widely expecting the U.S. central bank to boost interest rates a half percentage point later this week as part of an ongoing effort to quell inflation. Last week, the central banks of Australia and Canada, where inflation has also soared, increased rates by 50 basis points, while the European Central Bank said it would end asset purchases and begin rate hikes later this summer.  ""We expect major central banks to quickly and methodically continue removing accommodation via quantitative tightening (QT) and policy rate hikes into 2023,"" First Republic Bank said in a weekly review for investors.  ""Markets will also remain very fragile, as today’s negative reaction to the higher than expected inflation print demonstrated,"" First Republic added. ""We expect this fragility to continue whipsawing markets.""  For cryptocurrencies, which have correlated with equity markets increasingly over the past year, the path forward is at best uncertain, DiPasquale said.  ""Last week, we mentioned that the probability of a breakdown was higher despite BTC showing signs of support,"" he wrote. ""That breakdown is currently in play, and we will be looking for potential new lows and reactions to them as we assess market sentiment. The inflation figures definitely don't bode well for markets.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,900 -2.9%  DJIA: 39,392 -2.7%  Nasdaq: 11,340 -3.5%  Gold: $1,876 -0.2%  Insights  Is There a Case for Inflation?  Cryptocurrency evangelists trumpet digital assets’ ability to hold, if not decrease, the price of goods and services more loudly than perhaps any other of their benefits.  They argue that deflation is more desirable than inflation, and have been conveniently able to highlight the havoc the current inflationary surges have played with investor nerves and the global economy. Last Friday’s consumer price index (CPI) showing an 8.6% jump in prices, the highest in more than four decades, only heightened fears that central banks’ more hawkish monetary policies were failing to lower costs or prevent a recession.  Yet, in an op-ed Friday, Paul Brody, the global blockchain leader for consulting powerhouse EY and a CoinDesk contributor, asserted that inflation is preferable to deflation and that the current spike in prices is temporary.  “Let’s start with the most foundational error common across multiple crypto ecosystems: the idea that deflationary systems are better than inflationary ones,” Brody writes, noting that Ethereum advocates are as adamant as “Bitcoin maximalists.”  “The theory is appealing: If you have crypto and the rate at which new crypto is added goes to zero or starts to go negative, the value of your crypto should rise,” he writes. “The hidden assumption in there is that demand for said crypto remains the same or goes up.”  Yet, Brody writes that “deflationary ecosystems” have historically failed, including most notably during the Great Depression when the U.S. abandoned its gold standard.  Brody notes that consumers in times of deflation are more likely to hold currency that they expect will gain value over time, boosting savings but sinking demand for products and services, while during inflation, they are apt to spend. But he also makes the key point that perfect price stability is “an impossible and unreasonable target.”  “All things being equal, a little inflation is better than a little deflation,” Brody writes, adding that central banking efforts the past two years first to boost the economy by keeping interest rates low and then to control inflation are not the disaster that some critics are contending. “Inflation and central banks seem to be performing exactly as intended,” he writes.  “Monetary and fiscal policy isn’t an exact science,” he writes, and compares the issues created by the pandemic to post World War II when inflation rose 18% before settling.  Some crypto advocates mistakenly believe that digital assets offer a solution to inflation. But they may be targeting the wrong issue. “Pushing for ever more deflationary architectures will certainly please the HODLers,” Brody writes, but it won’t further Ethereum’s cause, bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.  Technician's Take  (Editor's Note: In place of Technician's Take, First Mover Asia is republishing this essay by CoinDesk columnist David Z. Morris on this weekend's Consensus 2022 event.)  No One Is Saying 'Crypto Winter' at Consensus  AUSTIN, Texas — We’ve wrapped up the first full public day of Consensus, and I’ve been asked to share my thoughts about what I’m seeing from the ground. But it’s hard to think of anything more meaningful to say than simply:  Wow.  Woah.  Dang.  For a bit of context, CoinDesk held the very first Consensus event just under seven years ago, in 2015. Attendance was a whopping 500 people.  This year’s Consensus is the first in-person iteration of the conference since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The most recent attendance number I’ve heard for this year’s event is 17,000.  So yeah. Wow. Woah. Dang.  I’ve attended most of the Consensus conferences since 2016, and one point of reference in particular stands out – the infamous 2018 conference at New York’s Marriott Marquis. It was the height of post-initial coin offering mania. Though the mood was beginning to turn sour, the event attracted nearly 9,000 attendees.  See also: US Stablecoin Law Could Actually Pass This Year, Lawmakers Say  That was seemingly too much for the Marriott's space to handle: The registration lines give attendees trauma flashbacks to this day. That grim memory is one reason the conference made the move to Austin, Texas, where I’m ecstatic to report that I’ve seen no such traffic jams so far despite almost double the attendance.  An even more interesting comparison to 2018 is the vibe, man. The 2018 event came after a brutal market crash, with bitcoin (BTC) trading at about $6,600 during the event (down 66% from the local peak just shy of $20,000 the preceding December). The mood was fairly grim.  This year’s event was also preceded by a market crash. Bitcoin is down 57% from its all-time high of $67,000 set last November. But unlike in 2018, it’s hard to find a downcast eye or frowning face at Consensus 2022.  The convention center is packed with curious attendees hungry for knowledge about decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), Ethereum scaling systems and all kinds of relatively arcane, future-forward or speculative matters that don’t have much to do with the current market but could pay off big-time in the long run.  It’s true that markets in crypto are highly tied to sentiment – but for the most dedicated, it’s increasingly clear that sentiment isn’t entirely tied to markets. And that group is growing.  Another notable new presence at Consensus: real, widespread, in-your-face diversity. We’ve been talking for years about how the openness of crypto would make it accessible for a much broader spectrum of people, and we’re starting to see that really happen. As someone who grew up and lives in a multiracial environment, it made me feel particularly great to see a lot of Black folks in attendance, onstage and backstage. No small kudos for that has to go to the efforts of CoinDeskers and contributors including Isaiah Thomas, Tyrone Ross and Spencer Dinwiddie.  See also: Consensus Compared: Why 2022 Feels Different | Opinion  Unfortunately, Consensus’ growth also means more chances for attendees to misbehave. If you want to keep your dignity and reputation intact, you might want to avoid having full-length conversations while watching a panel, sneaking into unauthorized areas to pitch journalists or bringing a loudspeaker to disrupt panels (all behaviors I’ve seen in the last two days).  There’s a lot to gain at Consensus – but there’s even more to lose, if you leave people in the industry convinced you’re a jackass. Just because we have fun and make our own rules doesn’t mean we’re not respectful of each other.  Amid everything else, I managed to moderate a few panels on Thursday at the Big Ideas stage, put together by the Layer 2 features and opinion team. I got to talk about DAO design with Ellie Rennie from RMIT and others, and also had a VERY weird and fun conversation with Chris Gabriel, aka YouTube’s MemeAnalysis. For those who couldn’t make it or watch the streams of those events, we’ll likely have some clips and write-ups available soon.  Of course, it would have been a whole lot cooler if you’d seen it all in person. Here’s hoping that next year you’ll join us.
