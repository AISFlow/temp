The company confidentially filed an amended S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at the end of March, after the regulators sent a comment letter to the company, CEO Gene Hoffman said at a conference hosted by law firm Brown Rudnick in Manhattan. However, there is still no firm timeline for the IPO since the company wants to wait for the right market conditions, he later told CoinDesk.  Chia revealed in April 2023 that it wanted to go public, though its IPO plans took a detour because of financial distress at Credit Suisse, its underwriter. That led to Chia laying off a third of its staff in October.  Chia was founded by Bram Cohen, who invented the BitTorrent peer-to-peer filesharing technology. Unlike Bitcoin, which uses proof-of-work to run its blockchain, and Ethereum, which uses proof-of-stake, Chia uses proof-of-space and proof-of-time, which, in short, involves the allocation of computer storage on machines around the world.

However, recent warnings from CryptoQuant, a leading crypto analytics platform, suggest that Bitcoin could face a significant downturn to $52,000 if specific key levels are violated. This cautionary note comes amidst growing uncertainty in the Bitcoin derivatives market, with derivative traders showing unprecedented caution compared to previous halving cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Hysteria: Will History Repeat Itself Or Are We Heading For A Market Meltdown? Bitcoin Risky Level CryptoQuant‚Äôs analysis highlights declining open interest and funding rates in the Bitcoin derivatives market, indicating a ‚Äúcautious‚Äù stance among traders, particularly with the arrival of several institutional participants. CryptoQuant analyst Shiven Moodley noted: At this halving, derivative traders exhibit far more caution than in previous instances. This season witnesses the entry of numerous new institutional players into the market. According to the analyst, If Bitcoin‚Äôs price falls below the critical $60,000 support level, the top cryptocurrency could experience a notable correction to $52,000, signaling a potential short-term bearish trend.

Moodley stated: If the price breaks below $60,000, we might witness a decline to $52,000 before a subsequent rise. However, given the significant dominance of institutional ETFs, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they accumulate excess supply from liquidations near the short-term support level of $60,000. Analysts Sound Alarm On BTC‚Äôs Fragile Position Meanwhile, crypto trader and analyst Ali has further fuelled concerns by identifying a pivotal price level for Bitcoin. Ali‚Äôs analysis indicates that if Bitcoin drops to $50,500, over $15 billion in liquidations could occur on the Binance alone. #Bitcoin dropping to $50,500 will trigger over $15 billion in liquidations on #Binance alone! pic.twitter.com/9wQTVwprgx ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) April 17, 2024 Such a significant liquidation event could exert immense pressure on the market, potentially leading to further price declines and heightened volatility. This outlook echoes recent warnings from prominent analyst Crypto Rover, who has also cautioned about a potential liquidation event affecting short holders if Bitcoin climbs back to the crucial price mark of $71,600. Despite these concerns, some analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects.

Based on Trend Rider‚Äôs analysis, Cardano could rise to as high as $3 when this happens. Cardano To Rise To $3 If History Repeats Itself Trend Rider mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that if history repeats itself, Cardano might be on the brink of its ‚Äúultimate support test‚Äù before it makes a parabolic move to the upside. He further suggested that the crypto token could soar to $3, considering the same happened in October 2020 when Cardano‚Äôs price dipped to $0.10 and skyrocketed to $3 afterwards. Related Reading: Crypto Exchanges Bitcoin Supply Can Only Last For 9 Months, ByBit Report The crypto analyst also revealed that Cardano was currently experiencing a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossover and retest, which could mean it was indeed gearing up for another parabolic move. This RSI crossover is an indicator that ‚Äúperfectly predicts bull and bear markets for ADA.‚Äù Source: X Meanwhile, in an earlier X post, Trend Rider explained how crucial it was for Cardano to hold its current support level. According to him, ADA‚Äôs price is ‚Äúright now at an extremely critical level, and if it fails to hold its current support zone, then it could fall quickly to $0.25.‚Äù However, if Cardano manages to hold above this support level, then this could be the ‚Äúexact bottom right now‚Äù before it rises to $1, Trend Rider claimed. Trend Rider further elaborated that Cardano‚Äôs next move will depend ‚Äúentirely‚Äù on what Bitcoin does. He predicts that altcoins like Carano will experience a ‚Äúmonstrous bounce‚Äù if the flagship crypto rises above $65,000 after its current price dip. However, if Bitcoin‚Äôs price continues to dip, then it is ‚Äúbear market mode,‚Äù Trend Rider added. Cardano Won‚Äôt Be In The Red Forever Crypto analyst Alan Santana has provided some form of optimism to ADA holders, stating that the crypto token won‚Äôt be red forever. He made this statement while acknowledging that Cardano has maintained a bearish outlook, having been in the red for seven weeks now.

The Bitcoin halving, expected to take place late Friday night or early Saturday (April 20), comes with heightened expectations. In each previous case so far, the halving preceded massive sector-wide rallies. There is an ongoing debate whether the halving is ‚Äúpriced in,‚Äù or whether the reduced amount of bitcoin entering into circulation (this time dropping from around 900 BTC per day to 450 BTC) will create a kind of supply shock that will drive prices up (assuming demand for bitcoin remains constant or increases).  There are two economic theories that explain this debate. On one side are those who believe the halving is priced in believe the efficient market theory. They say because the event is known in advance, and everyone shares the same information, it is impossible that bitcoin is currently undervalued. On the other side are those who point to the historic four-year boom and bust cycle in crypto and/or the aforementioned supply-and-demand constraints.  See also: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving  Whatever theory you believe, it‚Äôs worth noting that this Bitcoin halving is already markedly different. For one, it‚Äôs the first time in Bitcoin history that bitcoin‚Äôs price has increased before the event. That‚Äôs largely because of the launch of nearly a dozen spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., which have been vacuuming up bitcoin at unprecedented rates. BlackRock‚Äôs bitcoin fund, for instance, has the fifth-fastest inflows of any ETF so far this year.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more work to do, but the industry has made significant progress in making bitcoin more accessible and easier to use since 2020,‚Äù Miles Suter, Bitcoin product lead at Cash App, told CoinDesk in an email. ‚ÄúWhile the recent rally has been led by institutional investors, with past halvings we‚Äôve seen a positive sentiment shift in the market that attracts new retail traders; I think the cycle will repeat itself.‚Äù  What‚Äôs different? The institutions  The institutionalization of bitcoin has another element over and above changing the kinds of buyers of bitcoin (or the way they enter the market): It also serves to legitimize the sector. In previous years, the biggest-name buyers of bitcoin were Michael Saylor‚Äôs relatively unknown software company MicroStrategy, known bitcoin fan Jack Dorsey‚Äôs Block and Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla, which partially walked back its commitment due to environmental concerns.  ETFs changed that forever. This isn‚Äôt to suggest that Wall Street doesn‚Äôt have its detractors, but it is significant that firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, VanEck and WisdomTree were all clamoring to be first to market in offering a traditional onramp into this nascent digital economy. Bitcoin, once thought to be the Wild West, is becoming normalized ‚Äî and no one is quite sure what is on the other side.  See also: Bitcoin ETFs Are Driving a Spot Multiplier Effect  ‚ÄúThe people, institutions and governments that matter in the big picture are only *just beginning* to wake up to Bitcoin,‚Äù Lane Rettig, founder of SpaceMesh and former Ethereum developer, said. ‚ÄúYes, this process takes a painfully long time, longer than we expect or would like - it's like a dragon slowly awakening, and right now it's just begun to stir.‚Äù  It was a point echoed by Nelson Rosario of Rosario Tech Law, who views the halving as just the latest thing to drive attention to Bitcoin. ‚ÄúI think the questions I've seen around this halving somewhat miss the point. The fact is Bitcoin is at all-time high levels. It is a semi-regular news story in the financial press, and yet mass adoption still feels years away,‚Äù he said.  Macroeconomic factors  Indeed, analysts at both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs this week published reports dampening the idea that the halving will bring in new buyers. A rallying market leading into the halving may be a way to generate buzz, but it may have also ‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù a portion of ‚Äúthe typical post-halving rally,‚Äù JPMorgan analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.  More importantly, macroeconomic conditions in 2024 are completely different than during the preceding decade of low interest rates and low inflation. Goldman's Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities as well as Equities teams wrote that the higher interest rates today may make high risk investments like crypto less attractive.  It‚Äôs a point bolstered by BTC‚Äôs performance this week following news the Federal Reserve is reversing course from lowering interest rates, which would have brought liquidity into the economy. Price predictions from market analysts vary wildly, with some saying bitcoin could fall to as low as $40,000 post halving or rally above $150,000 by the end of the year.  See also: Bitcoin Rebounds as $150K Target for 2024 Comes in View  Pseudonymous trader Poordart gave a ‚Äúprimitive calculation‚Äù adding to the idea that bitcoin could fall following the halving. ‚ÄúAssuming miners sell all mined bitcoin eventually, reducing the average daily number of bitcoin mined from 900 to 450 ($54 million to $27 million at current prices) should have some effect ‚Äî $189m inflow per week less required just to keep price stable,‚Äù he told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin‚Äôs 50% price gains this year seem to support the idea that people are willing to take risks ‚Äî though that doesn‚Äôt mean traders shouldn‚Äôt proceed with caution. To some extent, the stakes of this halving are even more unclear than ever due to these institutionalization and macroeconomic trends, with some concerned that the halving distracts from the ultimate mission of Bitcoin.  ""It is an odd thing to have to treat very, very human-made events as if they are acts of nature or God,‚Äù Nathan Schneider, professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder and author of ‚ÄúGovernable Spaces: Democratic Design for Online Life.‚Äù ‚ÄúI long for the day when network-native economies are designed to serve human flourishing, not arbitrary parameters in code.""  Others, like Sarah Meyohas, creator of Bitchcoin and recent Satoshi Nakamoto inscription and hologram series, sees the halving as a symbol of Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience. ‚ÄúAs we approach Bitcoin's halving, I am moved by the notion that a few people can shape the future of an entire generation through ideas alone.‚Äù  How the halving will impact bitcoin miners  A mix of factors ‚Äî including halving the block reward, higher costs, cautious investors and an increasingly crowded mining sector ‚Äî could be a harsh reality for bitcoin miners after the halving ramps up competition to find the next block.  Historically, the halving has been a boon for the price of bitcoin, helping miners reap a fat profit margin. However, this time, it's different as publicly-traded and private bitcoin miners will have to work harder not just to mine the next block but also to convince investors and the markets to have faith in their ability to make money.  Heading into this halving, miners are greeted with a cautious tone from investors. For instance, stocks from mining firms Marathon Digital, Hut 8 and Riot Platforms are down roughly 33%, 35% and 46%, respectively, this year. The risk associated with bitcoin mining is seen as greater than alternative mainstream ways to get exposure to crypto, including spot bitcoin ETFs, equities like Coinbase (COIN) and the broad based CoinDesk 20 index, which are less volatile.  Read more: Bitcoin Soared to an All-Time High. So Why Aren't Miners Blasting Off, Too?  To be able to survive and thrive after this halving, miners will need to be efficient, cash flow generating and have proper treasury management in place, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju wrote. He predicts that even if bitcoin remains at the $60,000 price level the current crop of mining machines would become unprofitable to run for many firms ‚Äî leading to a wave of bankruptcies.  Unless they are able to quickly deploy the latest generation of more efficient machines, Ju said that bitcoin‚Äôs price will need to rise to around $80,000 for miners to remain profitable using Bitmain's S19 XP mining machines, the most commonly utilized miners by U.S. companies.  Miners have already started to replace their older-generation machines with newer ASICs. However, having the latest technology may not be enough to appease investors. Miners must prove they can make money by deploying capital efficiently, cutting costs, finding cheaper sources of power and generating positive cash flow for shareholders.  Doom and gloom?  For profitable firms, the post-halving landscape may become a season for mergers and acquisitions. Firms like Galaxy Digital, with its Helios mining farm, the largest liquid-cooled mine in the Northeast, are already buying up less efficient machines as the cheap cost of electricity in West Texas makes it profitable to run outdated chips.  It‚Äôs not all doom and gloom. Increasingly, transaction fees are becoming a significant contributor to miners. Historically, miners earned lion's shares of profit from the block rewards. However, with the increasing ways to use the Bitcoin blockchain ‚Äî most notably through the Ordinals protocol ‚Äî miners are taking in more through increased fees.  Another option, which some miners have already started to include in their business plan, is to diversify into other sources of revenue, such as repurposing existing data centers to host computing resources for artificial intelligence or cloud computing.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is a ‚ÄòShow Me the Money‚Äô Moment for Miners  While others see the drop in revenues as potentially existential for miners, some experts think that the effects will be relatively muted compared to prior years. Some, like Colin Harper, researcher and writer for Luxor Technology‚Äôs Hashrate Index, thinks that this could be the first year that there is no dip in Bitcoin's hashrate, or the amount of energy contributed to network security, because prices have remained so high.  ""Mining margins won't be as good after the halving as they are now, obviously, but they won't be horrendous,"" Colin Harper, researcher and writer for Luxor Technology‚Äôs Hashrate Index, told CoinDesk. ""And if the new Runes fungible token protocol makes a significant impact on transaction fees, then margins will be healthy enough to keep miners with higher costs online for longer than not.""  Launch of Runes  As mentioned, NFT-like inscriptions, made possible by the launch of the Ordinals protocol, have changed the game for Bitcoin. Not only has it shifted the economic landscape for miners, but it's also renewed developer excitement in the first cryptocurrency, which in recent years was losing out to chains like Ethereum and Solana.  This halving will also see the launch of the Runes protocol, created by Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor. The system, which will allow tokens to be created, minted and transferred on Bitcoin, is set to launch immediately following the halving with the goal of introducing greater utility to Bitcoin ‚Äî a mission which started with Rodarmor's prior creation, Ordinals.  Rodarmor has described Runes as creating a venue for meme coins on Bitcoin, only with greater simplicity and efficiency than is currently provided by the BRC-20 token standard. Already, several Runes projects are being planned to coincide with the launch of the new protocol.  Network security  Although, in prior years, halvings did not lead to an economic attack on Bitcoin (like a 51% attack), there are some concerns that lower profitability could lead to enough miners turning off that it becomes theoretically possible. For instance, Bitcoin's hash rate declined 15% after the 2020 halving, 5% after 2016's halving, and 13% after 2012, therefore making Bitcoin less secure.  ‚ÄúThe halving is one of the dumbest parts of how Bitcoin was designed. If you're going to reduce subsidy over time, the right way to do it is gradually, rather than shocking the system every four years,‚Äù legendary Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúFortunately fees are getting higher, so the risk of havings is reducing. Hopefully this one goes alright.‚Äù  See also: How the Bitcoin Halving Could Affect Network Security  Rodarmor, and others, see Runes as important to the post-halving Bitcoin ecosystem in that it could bring out additional demand for block space ‚Äî thereby bolstering the mining economy. Higher fees for validating transactions could however help to offset lower block reward revenue and keep the hash rate higher.  ""I wouldn't advocate changing the halving schedule, but if I was going to design Bitcoin from scratch, I probably would not have picked such a fast decay,"" Rodarmor told CoinDesk. ""But you don't go to war with the army you want, you go to war with the army you have. And this is the Bitcoin we have.""  Ordinals was contentious among some corners of the Bitcoin community for causing network congestion and soaring user fees, something Runes would also probably face if it proves successful.  ""I don't think that the best and highest use case for Bitcoin is Runes; I think that is bitcoin itself as a neutral, value delivery network,"" Rodarmor said. ""However, I do think that it is good to create sources of demand for Bitcoin transactions, because ultimately that helps the security of the network.""

Recipients are able to start verifying token claims now up until May 4, and the tokens will be distributed when Avail DA launches.  Last week, CoinDesk reported that the details of the token airdrop were leaked, and many of the details were confirmed in Avail‚Äôs blogpost on Thursday.  Avail came into the limelight last year for developing its DA solution, which helps blockchains with data processing off-chain. DA solutions have gained a lot of buzz over the past few months, with the debut of projects like Celestia, which went live in October, and Eigenlayer‚Äôs EigenDA, which went live last week.  In February, Avail shared details about two other core products that the team is building out: Avail Nexus, which is an infrastructure layer that connects different rollups to each other through the Avail ecosystem, and Avail Fusion, which will take crypto assets like ether (ETH) or bitcoin (BTC) and contribute them to Avail‚Äôs security.  ‚ÄúThe unification drop is a unifying force bringing different communities together, rewarding developers, governance contributors, technical educators, rollup users, stakers and other valuable contributors from across multiple blockchain communities,‚Äù Avail wrote in a blogpost.

They emphasize that while the Bitcoin halving is a noteworthy event, other major factors will likely exert greater influence on Bitcoin‚Äôs future value. Bitcoin Halving To Play Lesser Role In BTC‚Äôs Outlook In a note to clients, Goldman Sach‚Äôs analysts have cautioned against reading too much into the past Bitcoin halving cycles and their impact on the cryptocurrency. Based on historical trends, the Bitcoin halving cycles tend to have a favorable effect on the value of Bitcoin, often triggering a bull run. The bank noted that whether the Bitcoin halving scheduled for April 20, becomes a ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news event,‚Äù it would hold less significance for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs medium-term outlook. They argue that the future performance of the pioneer cryptocurrency would be more heavily influenced by the supply and demand dynamics within the current market. Additionally, the analysts highlighted that the growing interest and demand for Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) combined with the self-reflexive nature of the crypto market would be the primary contributing factor to Bitcoin‚Äôs price action and future outlook. Sharing a similar perspective, analysts at CryptoQuant disclosed earlier in April that the 2024 Bitcoin halving was no longer a primary catalyst for Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish surge. They highlighted that factors such as increasing demand from large-scale investors and diminishing supply were now the key drivers of Bitcoin‚Äôs upward momentum. Analysts Warn Of Macroeconomic Influence On New Halving Cycle Analysts at Goldman Sachs have predicted that macroeconomic factors such as inflation could have a significant influence on the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. ‚ÄúCaution should be taken against extrapolating the past cycles and the impact of halving, given the respective prevailing macro conditions,‚Äù Goldman Sachs analysts noted. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Don‚Äôt Buy Altcoins Just Yet ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why Unlike previous halving cycles, the present economic conditions display high inflationary pressures and interest rates, which could cause the 2024 Bitcoin halving cycle to diverge from historical patterns. In other words, the analysts have suggested that for Bitcoin‚Äôs historical halving bull runs to occur, macro conditions need to be supportive of investor risk-taking. Currently, the United States faces challenges with high inflation, while interest rates stand above 5%. These conditions may exert pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics. However, despite the prevailing circumstances, many see the digital currency as a formidable inflation hedge and a beacon of hope against escalating inflationary pressures.

Lummis: It'll Pay to 'Choose Circle Over Tether' Under U.S. Stablecoin Proposal,"The U.S. company Circle would have an easier time than Tether choosing to comply with the stablecoin regulations proposed by U.S. Sens. Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand.  Lummis argued U.S. customers will prefer U.S.-regulated stablecoin issuers.  Circle Internet Financial would have a distinct advantage over global stablecoin leader Tether under U.S. regulations along the lines being suggested by new legislation, according to one of the latest bill's authors, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.).  ""Let's say you're a U. S. consumer,"" and you're not an expert in the details about specific stablecoin issuers, Lummis told CoinDesk TV in an interview. She argued such a person is likely to favor companies overseen by U.S. regulations.  ""If that were me, I would choose Circle over Tether,"" said Lummis, who introduced the latest stablecoin legislative proposal this week with her usual crypto partner Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).  Stablecoins are designed to be tokens with steady value ‚Äì typically pegged to the U.S. dollar ‚Äì and are vital for use in other crypto trading or contracts. The Lummis-Gillibrand proposal is positioned as a work-in-progress bill meant to start conversations and to be modified for melding with whatever version emerges from the House, she said. But as it stands, it echoes other previous legislative efforts in demanding a bank-like regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers.  ""This is very much oriented towards a U.S.-regulated company, and so Tether, if it chooses to remain offshore ‚Ä¶ that's a business choice for them,"" Lummis said, and the company and token, {{USDT}}, would presumably be picked up by other regulators and continue operating beyond the U.S. system. ""We're very focused on companies that are located and embedded in the U. S. economy.""  Still, she said she'd expect existing stablecoin leaders such as Circle would have major regulatory hurdles to clear, such as getting licensed with a federal regulator. (Circle, as it exists today, would not be allowed to issue its {{USDC}} under the proposed bill, which demands that businesses issuing more than $10 billion in tokens be regulated depository institutions ‚Äì either on the state or federal level.)  Circle hasn't responded to requests seeking comment on the bill.  ""We're glad we went ahead and put it out just to get some good feedback,"" Lummis said, describing it as a ""very firm, solid regulatory framework"" that's meant to satisfy lawmakers who are worried about the crypto disasters they've been witnessing since 2022. ""We're happy to adjust it according to changes the House might want to make, changes the White House might want to make, changes the industry might want to make.""  While cryptocurrency legislation remains a longshot for this session of Congress, when viewing its current political turmoil, party divisions, workload and proximity to elections, several prominent lawmakers continue to issue optimistic statements. Recently, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) reportedly said he's willing to talk about stablecoins (though alongside a number of his other banking priorities), and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also said he's open to it.  The House Financial Services Committee's heads recently met with Schumer about moving crypto legislation, though it's unclear how far those talks have advanced. Lummis said Thursday that she's still waiting to see what emerges from the committee's chiefs, Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). Spokespeople for both lawmakers did not return requests for comment about the Lummis-Gillibrand bill.  Industry insiders have been studying the legislation closely since its release, and some have said they remain uncertain about its potential effects and requirements.

42390961,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRGcN,1713464148,"Bitcoin Halving Is Not a Bullish Event, Says 10x Research Analyst","Bitcoin could drop to as low as $50,000 over the next few weeks as the macroeconomic uncertainty looms over the crypto market, said Markus Thielen, co-founder of 10x Research.  Even the halving, which takes place on Saturday, might not drive the price of bitcoin up as most of the price action after previous cycles was driven by a better macro environment.  Bearish signals are looming over the crypto market these days and will almost certainly push prices down in the short term, well-known research analyst Markus Thielen said.  Thielen, who has previously predicted many bull and bear rallies in crypto, currently sees no catalysts that would bring prices up again, he said on CoinDesk‚Äôs Markets Daily podcast.  ‚ÄúWe don't have the typical drivers anymore that really brought prices from the $40,000 to the $70,000 region,‚Äù he said. The main reason behind this, he added, is the spot bitcoin ETFs, which have seen little to no new inflows over the past few weeks as investors have moved past the initial euphoria of the January launch.  ‚ÄúIt seems that a lot of the TradFi investors aren‚Äôt biting anymore,‚Äù Thielen said.  Both the slowdown of flows into the ETFs and the recent sell off in crypto assets, however, are a result of a much bigger story, argued Thielen. It's the macro environment, he said, that has been and will continue to be the main driver behind prices.  ‚ÄúI think a lot of the bitcoin rally is maybe built on wrong expectations and again,"" said Thielen. ""I think what's really, really crucial is that these ETF flows didn't stop out of the blue, they stopped around March 12 when the consumer price index and when the producer price index came out.‚Äù  At the end of last year and into early 2024, traders were betting on multiple interest cuts by the Federal Reserve this year on expectations of a continued downtrend in inflation. That anticipation drove risk assets, such as tech stocks and cryptocurrencies, significantly higher.  However, recent data, in particular the March inflation reports noted by Thielen, has shown that inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, leading the central bank to repeatedly voice uncertainty about whether it will indeed be able to lower interest rates this year.  ‚ÄúWe need to get the macro headwinds out of the way,‚Äù Thielen said. For now, he expects a consolidation period which could last for a few weeks and could push bitcoin down to around $50,000 before coming back up towards the end of the year.  Bitcoin Halving Is Not Bullish  Thielen also cautioned investors about the upcoming halving on April 20th, which many assume will be a wildly bullish event for bitcoin. This expectation stems from the token's previous post-halving cycles which typically saw bitcoin race to new all-time highs.  Thielen, though, contended that those bull moves were largely a result of the positive macro environment, and not driven by the halving itself. The most recent halving in May 2020, for example, came alongside massive monetary and fiscal stimuli surrounding the Covid shutdowns.  ‚ÄúI wouldn't give almost any credit to the halving because I don't think the halving is the big driver,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's really the big macro factors.‚Äù",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/18/bitcoin-halving-is-not-a-bullish-event-says-10x-research-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/958e2406a45d227bbdeb1d9bc52c966313c3cd64-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Drawing from this historical context, Dark Defender suggests that XRP‚Äôs current sideways movement may indicate an impending surge, highlighting consistent Fibonacci points as evidence of potential price targets. This moment is not just a coincidence, it‚Äôs a Deja Vu. A Deja Vu that takes us back to 2017, a time of significant shifts in the cryptocurrency market. We had one of the most extended sideways but the targets and the support Fibonacci points are still the same.

In the early hours of today, XRP exhibited a modest uptick, posting a marginal increase of around 1.2% and reaching a 24-hour high of $0.50. However, at the time of writing, the altcoin has retraced back down by 0.4% with a current market price of $0.49. XRP Market Sentiment Amidst this fluctuation, XRP whales have demonstrated a bearish sentiment. Particularly, Whale Alerts, a whale transaction tracker, has recently shared significant transactions on social media platform X, highlighting the movement of large volumes of tokens. One notable transaction involved the transfer of 158 million tokens valued at $77 million from a private wallet to the Binance crypto exchange. This sizable transfer raised concerns among investors anticipating a shift from a bearish trend to a bullish surge. Additionally, another transaction involved the transfer of 28.9 million XRP, equivalent to $14.2 million, to Bitstamp. Despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, cryptocurrency analyst Javon Marks, similar to Darkdefender, has revealed his optimistic outlook on the altcoin. Related Reading: XRP Price Set For 3,000% Rally To $22, Analyst Predicts Marks, previously recognized for his bullish stance on the altcoin, recently adjusted his predictions, envisioning a 400x surge in XRP‚Äôs price.

42390968,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRH21,1713461262,Mango Markets Exploiter Avi Eisenberg Found Guilty of Fraud and Manipulation,"NEW YORK ‚Äì A Manhattan jury has found crypto trader Avi Eisenberg guilty of fraud and market manipulation for his $110 million heist from decentralized finance protocol Mango Markets in October 2022.  Eisenberg was arrested in Puerto Rico in December 2022 and charged with commodities fraud, commodities manipulation, and wire fraud for the scheme. He will be sentenced on July 29 by New York District Court Judge Arun Subramanian. Eisenberg faces up to 20 years in federal prison for his crimes.  ‚ÄúThis ground-breaking prosecution epitomizes this office‚Äôs ability to employ innovative methods and cutting-edge law enforcement tools to continue to protect all financial markets,"" said Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a Thursday press statement. ""The career prosecutors of this office continue their expertise in prosecuting financial fraud, one of our core priorities, and would-be financial criminals should think twice before daring to engage in illicit conduct on our watch.‚Äù  During his trial in New York‚Äôs Southern District, Eisenberg‚Äôs defense attempted to frame his trades on Mango Markets as ‚Äúsuccessful and legal,‚Äù arguing that they ‚Äúfully complied‚Äù with the decentralized protocol‚Äôs scanty rules at the time of the heist.  But the 12-person jury didn‚Äôt buy it, instead siding with prosecutors‚Äô arguments that Eisenberg‚Äôs actions constituted ‚Äúbrazen‚Äù fraud and manipulation.  Eisenberg is the latest crypto figure to be convicted of fraud, following shortly on the heels of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs conviction and subsequent 25 year sentence for his role in the collapse of FTX, and Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon being found liable for fraud in civil fraud case against him earlier this month.  On October 11, 2022, Eisenberg made three massive MNGO perpetual futures trades between himself, pumping the price over 1000% and then using his newly-created collateral to trick the protocol into allowing him to ‚Äúborrow‚Äù $110 million in various cryptocurrencies.  But Eisenberg wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúborrowing,‚Äù he was stealing ‚Äì hours after the exploit, he posted an anonymous proposal to the Mango Markets decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) offering to return $67 million of his ill-gotten gains in exchange for a promise not to pursue charges against him and permission to pocket the rest.  Though Eisenberg‚Äôs defense team, headed by well-known crypto defense lawyer Brian Klein, argued that Eisenberg was acting within the law, prosecutors showed the jury a bucket of evidence ‚Äì including internet searches for things like ‚Äústatute of limitations market manipulation‚Äù and ‚ÄúFBI surveillance‚Äù and ‚Äúelements of fraud‚Äù and his flight to Israel after his identity as the exploiter was unmasked ‚Äì suggesting he knew his actions were criminal.  ""We're obviously disappointed, but we will keep fighting for our client,"" Klein told CoinDesk. ""We plan to file a number of post-trial motions.""  UPDATE (April 18, 2024 17:38 UTC): Adds Eisenberg's sentencing date.  UPDATE (April 18, 2024 19:26 UTC): Adds statement from Damian Williams.

42390967,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdRH79,1713459251,‚ÄòIt Can Be Said With Confidence the SEC Is Investigating Ethereum‚Äô: Consensys‚Äô Bill Hughes Talks Crypto Law,"Last month, news broke that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had subpoenaed the Ethereum Foundation in a seeming first move in preparing a potential lawsuit. At this point, all the world knows, really, is that some ‚Äústate authority‚Äù had made contact, the organizing force behind the creation of second-largest cryptocurrency ether {{ETH}}, according to the missing ‚Äúcanary‚Äù on the for-profit foundation.  Consensys, the Fort Worth, Texas-based incubator that has developed a number of core tools for the Ethereum ecosystem, including the largest non-custodial wallet MetaMask, node infrastructure service Infura as well as clients like Besu and Teku. To a large extent, Ethereum wouldn‚Äôt be what it is today without Consensys.  Bill Hughes is a speaker at this year's Consensus Festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  ‚ÄúWhat I'll say is: Consensys likes to walk the walk and not just talk the talk,‚Äù Consensys Senior Counsel and Director of Global Regulatory Matters Bill Hughes, who is speaking at CoinDesk‚Äôs upcoming Consensus 2024 conference in May, said in an interview. The firm has spun out a number of projects built internally to be privately run or governed by their users. ‚ÄúIt's a tricky thing going from centralized to decentralized,‚Äù Hughes said.  If the SEC is building a case to declare a ETH a security ‚Äî like it has for similar blockchain projects like Solana {{SOL}}, Cardano {{ADA}} and Ripple {{XRP}} ‚Äî it may consider Consensys‚Äô outsized role in the ecosystem. There are a lot of reasons why it doesn‚Äôt make sense to redefine ETH as a security; notably, there is a multi-billion dollar economy that has already been built on it under the implicit understanding that it isn‚Äôt.  But that isn‚Äôt the only argument the agency could make. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum‚Äôs creator Vitalik Buterin is still around. There‚Äôs the open question of whether the ETH token launch was an ‚Äúinvestment contract.‚Äù Plus the aforementioned Ethereum Foundation, which still plays an active role in coordinating development. The question is whether ‚Äúthere is a common enterprise‚Äù building Ethereum, and whether investors expect to practice from their work.  It‚Äôs a tricky legal subject, not made easier by the SEC‚Äôs reluctance to provide clear guidance regarding crypto. In fact, the securities watchdog may even be deploying backdoor strategies to try to sow confusion, like issuing a special purpose broker dealer license to a trading platform that intends to list ETH as a security or lying to a court to freeze a small blockchain project‚Äôs funds.  CoinDesk reached out to Consensys‚Äô Bill Hughes to get an overview of the ETH securities issue, Consensys‚Äô role in the ecosystem and whether specially licensed broker dealer Prometheum may be used as a wedge to deny approval of spot ether exchange-traded funds.  Are crypto lobbyists doing a good job?  I think they are. It‚Äôs hard because the policy space is pretty confusing. The subject matter is pretty confusing. Many people they need to talk to just don't care one way or another. I mean, I'm biased, I'm on the board of Blockchain Association, but it does a really good job of keeping its membership informed, educating them about the Hill and and coming up with smart plans on how to pursue what we view as productive policy ends. Crypto lobbyists aren't some monolith. But there are people who are very effective both because they know the Hill and because they understand fundamentally what the technology is, what it can do and how we can figure out how public policy can be brought to bear to address some of the risks.  How much of your role at Consensys is educating people in D.C.  Not too much. It depends on what's going on. If we need to do it, I'm probably the guy to do it or coordinate it. But it's ebbed and flowed over time. Consensys is not some bureaucratic behemoth where roles have existed for decades. I have to make decisions as to what needs to be done and how to go about doing it, and sometimes that requires me to pay more attention to policy discussions and engage with legislators or other policy folks in and around D.C. and sometimes it doesn't.  So, I would say over time, I've certainly focused more of my attention internally. I've been wearing two hats in that regard. As the company has expanded, and our offerings have gotten more diverse, and the regulatory picture has sort of evolved globally, more and more and more of my attention over time has been focused internally on advising the company or product teams.  Two related questions: Do you think the SEC is possibly building a case against the Ethereum Foundation? And also, what is the best argument that ETH is not a security?  So with respect to the first question I wouldn't make that argument specifically. I‚Äôm not able to say whether the SEC is looking to bring a case against that particular party related to Ethereum. The way they've typically gone about declaring a token a security is generally going after some third party, and in the course of that case, calling some other token a security [like naming SOL or ADA in the Coinbase suit]. There are instances in which they've gone after the putative security token issuer [like Ripple], but they don't need to do that. I do think the reporting is robust enough that it can be said with confidence that the SEC is investigating Ethereum.  It‚Äôs likely they will flip flop as to [ETH‚Äôs] categorization under the investor protection laws. I will note that as recently as October 2023, the SEC permitted Ethereum-based futures ETFs to be traded on securities exchanges. That implied the asset the futures contract was based on was not a security. So something has happened between then and now, which appears to have caused the SEC to flip positions.  It‚Äôs certainly reasonable for the market to be very alarmed at this in part because a lot of people are invested in this ecosystem. The SEC completely changing tracks like this would undo years of established fact about what Ethereum was, at least as the market conceived of it, and is dangerously disruptive to all of it. So it's going to be something that should be closely watched.  What do you think is happening with Prometheum? Is this an example of the SEC picking winners?  I was just reading a law article blog last night about Prometheum. And it noted that this entity with a special purpose broker dealer license does not require the SEC‚Äôs formal approval for how it operates. Further, there was some guidance put out about four years ago, and that‚Äôs about it ‚Äî that there‚Äôs only one special purpose broker dealer in four and a half years really tells you how effective this regulatory program has been.  If Prometheum says Ethereum is a security, the SEC doesn‚Äôt need to specifically approve that, but it may present an opportunity for the SEC, not to have to declare one way or another on its own, but just sort of as a result change its position. The SEC would then be required to engage the CFTC, which it appears they have not done, and come to some process through which products which are only overseen by the CFTC today ‚Äî futures products ‚Äî would somehow morph into products which are traded on platforms overseen by both agencies. The law blog identified at least some precedent for that, but it raises a whole host of questions.  So with respect to your initial question: It is amazingly coincidental that the SEC is appearing to take a different at least rhetorical and tactical approach to Ethereum and that happens to coincide with the first ever SPDB materializing essentially out of nowhere, and being brought to the forefront of the political consciousness in terms of the crypto debate in D.C.  If you look up who's sitting with Prometheum at congressional hearings, you see these very oddly associated lobbyists. And you're like, ‚ÄúHow does somebody from New York running an SPDB know this former Democratic chairman from Tennessee?‚Äù It's not crazy to say there's some backroom politics being played. I'm not one for conspiracy theories, but there's a lot that stinks about what's been going on with Prometheum.  We'll see what if anything follows from them declaring that Ethereum will be the first asset that they custody. I would bet that you will see that fact somewhere in a rejection of the spot Ethereum ETFs.  Do you think Metamask will launch a token? And is there a regulatory reason why they wouldn't or is it purely functional?  What I'll say is: Consensys likes to walk the walk and not just talk the talk. Metamask is the best, most trusted, most useful wallet for the ecosystem that it operates in. It‚Äôs expanding as Snaps is doing well. At the end of the day, the goal is not just to create a new type of internet browser that we control wholly, but from Joe [Lubin] on down, the company really fervently believes in a new paradigm for how projects like this can be owned and maintained and sustained over time.  It's a tricky thing going from centralized to decentralized. I'm not announcing anything with respect to MetaMask generally, but it's safe to say that something as big as MetaMask shouldn't just be owned and operated by Consensys. It should be owned and operated by the community. Mechanisms to decentralize things oftentimes include tokens. But how or when that would happen ‚Äî nothing to report in that regard.  Are there any similarities between working at Consensys versus working at the White House?  I think yes. I've worked at two White Houses, which tend to be pretty hierarchical. Consensys is too, to some degree. But in terms of where ideas can come from, in terms of how we solicit feedback, come up with new ideas and work and lead and collaborate with each other ‚Äî it's much more flat. White House's are all about the President's agenda, whereas Consensys there's an agenda created through consensus. We have our own mission, we have a vision and values, which are well communicated across the company. The things we believe in dictate what we focus on.  Consensys is very much a family atmosphere. You don't get that family atmosphere at a White House. People are very transient at a White House. There's a lot of zero sum games politically at a White House.  But it's the same in the sense that they both have leaders throughout the organization who stand apart in their influence because they have a singular vision to achieve. Whether it be the White House or Consensys, or any other organization, there are those who I think the crowd listens to more closely when they are sharing their ideas or expressing their view as to what to do next.  Anything you‚Äôre looking forward to at Consensus?  To tease our panel for Consensus, the news just came out that apparently Uniswap received a Wells Notice. I think it is safe to predict that this is the first shot in the new front of the war against crypto for the SEC. And so by the time our panel rolls around, we're probably going to have a sizable chunk of SEC related news that me and the other panelists will be able to really sink our teeth into.  You're referring specifically to decentralized exchanges as the new front for the SEC?  No, just that Fortune is reporting that Uniswap just got a Wells Notice, meaning that a suit against Uniswap from the SEC is pending. And my point is I don't think that's going to be a one off item.  Yeah, probably not. Who do you think is likely to follow?  We will see.  PancakeSwap?  I will say that the SEC in practice has generally ‚Äî barring truly fraudulent behavior, not just a registration violation ‚Äî then generally their move has been to sue somebody in that same category and move on to another category. Binance they had to sue for all of the fraud related reasons. They did sue Coinbase and Kraken. We‚Äôll see if they sue other DEXes. But they could just stop on a DEX basis with Uniswap.  If Uniswap didn't run its own website ‚Äî the major portal into the Uniswap protocol ‚Äî would that be a legal protection for them?  We'll see. The SEC is very imaginative in the ways that you can be violating their rules and whether they point at the Uniswap front end as the problem or whether they point at anything Uniswap Labs may be doing with respect to upgrading or updating or maintaining or marketing the protocol generally.  I suspect, to the extent these reports are accurate, that it'll be at least both, if not other theories as well. It's hard to say with any certainty, but I don't expect Uniswap to tuck tail in such a circumstance. I would expect them to fight.

25978708,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603847,1713457829,"Here‚Äôs What Would Happen If The Bitcoin Price Fell Below $58,000","Crypto analyst Crypto Rover has provided insights into what could happen if the Bitcoin price drops below $58,000. The flagship crypto has continued to suffer price declines lately and risks dropping to that price level if it manages to break the crucial $60,000 support level. What A Drop Below $58,000 Would Mean For The Bitcoin Price Rover mentioned in a video on his YouTube channel that Bitcoin dropping below $58,000 would mean a breakdown for the flagship crypto token. He, however, quickly added that there‚Äôs still a lot of liquidity in the market, which he believes Bitcoin can take in and help drive its price back above $60,000 if the drop below $58,000 happens. Related Reading: XRP Price Set For 3,000% Rally To $22, Analyst Predicts He sounded optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs quick recovery if it dropped below $58,000. He revealed that he would not close his positions but rather open millions of dollars long positions if the flagship crypto dropped between $57,000 and $60,000. Meanwhile, Crypto Rover revealed that Bitcoin is still in the middle of a ‚Äúgigantic and enormous consolidation phase‚Äù and that Bitcoin will have a ‚Äúmassive breakout‚Äù when this consolidation period ends. For now, he highlighted that Bitcoin‚Äôs top side is still trending downwards while Bitcoin‚Äôs low side is trending upwards. Therefore, Crypto Rover claimed this is causing a ‚Äúcompression‚Äù in Bitcoin‚Äôs price. However, once this compression ends, Bitcoin will come out with a ‚Äúbanger,‚Äù the analyst added. Crypto Rover then alluded to the funding rates, which are currently negative. He noted that historically speaking, negative or low funding rates are always a Bitcoin buying opportunity. The Big Gains Are Yet To Come For BTC Crypto Rover also noted that the majority of Bitcoin‚Äôs gains always come after the Bitcoin halving and not before. As such, despite the crypto token rising to a new all-time high (ATH) before the halving, the analyst asserted that ‚Äúwhat we have seen so far is nothing for what we are about to be getting.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Whales Are On The Move Again, But Are They Bullish Or Bearish? He suggested that the halving event would be the catalyst for Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $100,000, mainly because it would create more scarcity. This would undoubtedly help increase Bitcoin‚Äôs value, especially if its demand continues to skyrocket. However, such a price surge might not come immediately, considering that Bitcoin‚Äôs price tends to increase 6 to 12 months after the halving. Hannah Phung, a lead analyst at on-chain analytics platform SpotOnChain, also recently made that observation, although she admitted that things could be different this time around, as this market cycle looks to be more different and mature than past ones. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $60.900, down almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin miners are rewarded for verifying new blocks on the Bitcoin network and securing it. For this effort, they are paid in bitcoin (BTC) at a current rate of 6.25 BTC per block verified, along with transaction fees. It takes about 10 minutes to verify a new block, and there are roughly 144 blocks verified every day, which equates to rewards of 900 BTC each day. Thus, the supply of BTC increases by this amount daily.  For every 210,000 blocks mined, the mining rewards available are reduced or halved. This occurs approximately every four years. After this upcoming halving, the fourth in the blockchain's 15-year history, a miner will receive 3.125 BTC for verifying a block, instead of 6.25 BTC. This will reduce the new BTC daily supply to about 450 BTC.  What is the current market status?  The daily exchange-traded volume of BTC varies depending on the source, but looking at the Messari volumes, we see a daily volume range of around $30 billion. At current prices (BTC = $64,000), the reduced new supply will equal $29 million or roughly 1% of the average daily exchange traded volume, down from 2%.  Miners, however, may not sell all their new coins. Research from CoinShares suggests that the average cost of mining a bitcoin after the halving will be around $40,000, depending on many variables. So, miners whose operational costs are less than the current market rate may choose to hold their coin and not bring it to market. However, this was always the case. You have some miners that sell all the rewarded BTC when they get it (either to take profit, cover operational costs or for capital investment) and others who hold excess Bitcoin in the expectation of price appreciation.  Another consideration is the ""free float"" (coins actively trading) in BTC. Currently, circa 93.5% or 19.635 million of all BTC have been mined. Of that, about 75% are considered to be held long-term (where BTC has been sitting in a wallet for longer than 155 days). This would leave a free float of ~5 million BTC, increasing the supply by 0.01% daily.  Also to consider are the new spot bitcoin ETFs. The average daily inflow volume into the new ETFs (including grayscale outflows) is $202 million. This is far more influential on prices than the reduction in supply.  What could this mean for the price of bitcoin?  Whilst it is obvious that a decrease in the supply should be net positive for the price of any commodity, this should also be true for bitcoin. The question is, how much should it increase and has the increase in price already been built into the current price? As we have seen with the ETF announcements, most pre-determined headlines become ""Buy the rumour, sell the fact"" events, and we see a risk of that here too.  We don‚Äôt find value in looking back on previous halvings, as there are not enough data points to be statistically meaningful. Additionally, trying to extrapolate correlations to halvings in an instrument that has gone up from $0 to $70,000 in a short period of time is difficult.  A much larger influence on the price of bitcoin will be the ETF flows, as these have the potential to change depending on sentiment dramatically. These flows can easily outstrip the reduction in supply from the halving.  In Summary:  We see the halving making a much larger impact on miners than the bitcoin price. Miners will have to adjust their operations to accommodate the smaller rewards they will get, whether that is by capital expenditure on more efficient equipment, cutting operational costs, or, indeed, selling more of their mined bitcoin.  One of the goals for participants in the digital asset space is to increase institutional adoption. Reducing the daily new supply by $29 million daily in a market that already transacts approximately $30 billion is relatively trivial. If the market cannot handle a reduction of $29 million daily supply, then it is not ready for institutions.  Look out for the ETF flows; they will dictate the price more so than a small decrease in supply growth.  - Mick Roche, senior trader, Zodia Markets  Ask an Expert  Q. How does the bitcoin halving affect the supply of bitcoin, and what impact does this have on its price?  The supply of bitcoin in the secondary market depends on holders looking to sell existing bitcoin and miners looking to sell the newly minted bitcoin they are awarded. Generally, in between halvings, the release of these new bitcoins creates a kind of equilibrium in the supply/demand dynamic of the secondary market where the reward can support the demand. When the halving occurs it creates a supply shock as the equilibrium is disturbed and no longer meets demand. Historically this has been a catalyst for the price to increase dramatically.  Q. Can you explain the concept of ""halving cycles"" in the context of Bitcoin's price history?  Since the halving is programmed to occur every 210,000 blocks, it creates a distinct time frame between these events that lasts about four years. In these four years, there has historically been a peak price, a trough price, a bull portion of the cycle, and a bear portion of the cycle. The most price appreciation has historically been in the month preceding and following the halving. This is a result of the supply shock that the halving creates. After the new supply/demand equilibrium is reached, the price peaks and then a drastic sell-off occurs until the BTC price finds its bottom or trough. This is usually 12-18 months after the halving. Once we get to the bottom, the price chops around, then steadily rises until we get close to the halving, and the cycle repeats.  Q. What are some potential strategies for investors to consider before, during, and after a Bitcoin halving event?  The main strategy we recommend to an investor with a long time horizon is just to buy and hold. Crypto volatility can be hard to manage, and it‚Äôs easy to get caught on the wrong side of a trade. That tends to lead to very emotional and sub-optimal decision-making. Over a multi-year timeframe, Bitcoin has tended to provide a great return to investors, so trying to improve on an already great return isn‚Äôt necessary to make a strategy successful.  - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Keep Reading  Bitcoin and ether ETFs received the green light Monday in Hong Kong and are expected to begin trading at the end of April.

Deutsche Bank said it does not expect a large rally after the event.  The geography of crypto miners is expected to shift following the halving to countries with lower energy costs, the bank said.  The bitcoin {{BTC}} reward halving, expected in the next couple of days, has already been partially priced in by the market and a large rally in the cryptocurrency is unlikely after it occurs, Deutsche Bank (DB) said in a research report on Thursday.  The quadrennial reward halving slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply and is expected to occur around April 19-20.  Bitcoin has climbed 44% year-to-date, CoinDesk Indices data show, more than double the gain of the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs outperformance was driven mainly by the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in January.  The positive performance of bitcoin cash {{BCH}} following its own halving event bodes well for the main Bitcoin network, the report said. Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork that split from the main Bitcoin network in August 2017. A fork is a modification to the original blockchain‚Äôs code.  ‚ÄúLooking ahead, we continue to expect prices to stay high due to expectations of future spot ether (ETH) ETF approvals; future central bank rate cuts; and regulatory changes,‚Äù analysts Marion Laboure and Cassidy Ainsworth-Grace wrote.  ‚ÄúAdding to that, a surge in layer 2 solutions and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, which augment the network‚Äôs practical utility, and the setup begins to look remarkably favorable for the Bitcoin ecosystem and the wider crypto space,‚Äù the authors wrote.  Deutsche Bank said it expects the geography of crypto mining to shift following the halving, as lower block rewards mean less profit, compelling miners to seek cheaper forms of energy.  ‚ÄúLatin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East have caught the attention of crypto miners due to their lower energy costs,‚Äù the report added.  The bank notes that previous halving events have driven cryptocurrency adoption, and more specifically retail adoption, as measured by the number of active bitcoin addresses.  ‚ÄúIn the first 150 days after each previous halving event, the number of retail addresses grew by 52% in 2012, 37% in 2016 and 3% in 2020.‚Äù  Read more: Bitcoin Likely to Drop After the Halving, JPMorgan Says",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/18/bitcoin-halving-partially-priced-in-with-no-big-rally-expected-afterward-deutsche-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/560c8907ac26ec8258aeb6d32c3d09b857e31446-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25974805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603863,1713452455,"Bitcoin To $455,000: Expert Echoes Previous Halving Pattern","In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, Marcel Knobloch also known as Collin Brown, a crypto expert has offered an audacious prediction for Bitcoin, foreseeing a significant rally to unprecedented heights post-BTC Halving event scheduled to take happen this month. Bitcoin Poised For Massive Growth Post-Halving According to Collin Brown, the fourth mining reward Halving for Bitcoin will take place in the next 48 hours. This event will cut down the current 6.25 BTC per block output to 3.125 BTC per block. Related Reading: Bitcoin Halving Hysteria: Will History Repeat Itself Or Are We Heading For A Market Meltdown? Brown noted that following the last Halving event, Bitcoin witnessed over 700% growth, bringing the crypto asset to its previous all-time high of $69,000 achieved at the peak of the 2021 bull cycle. Given the impact of the previous Halving, the crypto expert has predicted the coin will reach $455,000 should BTC mirror this pattern. The post read: In just forty-eight hours, Bitcoin‚Äôs fourth mining reward halving will occur. This quadrennial occurrence will slash the per-block emission of BTC to 3.125 BTC from the current 6.25 BTC. After the last halving, Bitcoin prices surged 700%, which would now bring $455,000. It is worth noting that since the cryptic developer of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, introduced the coin about 15 years ago, the Halving has been ingrained in the crypto‚Äôs program. This year‚Äôs event will happen when block 840,000 is created, which might increase BTC‚Äôs value by reducing supply. Historically, the three previous halvings have caused the price of the digital asset to soar significantly, amassing substantial gains. Data shared by Brown shows that following the first halving event, Bitcoin saw a whopping 9,360% rise, topping out around $1,135 from $12. However, it took the crypto asset approximately 371 days to reach the aforementioned figure after the Halving. Furthermore, the second halving, which occurred in 2016, drove Bitcoin‚Äôs price from $650 to $19,640, indicating an over 2,920% increase. Meanwhile, the last instance secured a 700% rally, taking prices from $8,626 to the previous peak of $69,045. Primarily, it took BTC more than 500 days in the preceding two cycles to reach new records. Considering the past trends, Brown‚Äôs forecast appears to be reasonable and possible. Should any of these trends reoccur, the crypto expert‚Äôs prediction might manifest in the following year. BTC On The Downside Collin Brown remains optimistic despite Bitcoin showing signs of weakness to retest its new all-time high of $73,000. Since reaching its new peak in mid-March, the value of BTC has plummeted by over 10%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops As Iran Launches Missile Attack On Israel ‚Äì What We Know So Far Today, the price of Bitcoin fell sharply, reaching a low of about $60,000 and reaching its lowest level since late February. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $62,916, down more than 10% over the past week. While its trading volume has increased by over 20%, its market cap is slightly down by 0.20% in the last day. The decline in BTC‚Äôs price is considered to be triggered by recent geopolitical tensions or global turmoil. The conflict between Israel and Iran caused major sell-offs among investors, leading to a broader market downturn.

42418378,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgqrt,1713452454,Protecting Crypto Users Is More Important Than Faster UK Registration: FCA Executive,"The U.K.'s FCA says it will prioritize trust over speed when it comes to crypto registrations.  The industry have said the FCA takes too long to approve crypto applications. The regulator has only approved 45 firms in four years.  The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) won't compromise a focus on trust just to more quickly register crypto companies, an executive from the national regulator said Thursday.  ""A simple focus on numbers could undermine trust and reputation,"" said Sarah Pritchard, the FCA's executive director for markets and international at TheCityUK conference, in response to industry complaints that the regulator takes far too long to register crypto companies.  The FCA, which is the country's main crypto regulator, has been processing registrations for crypto firms wishing to operate in the country and comply with its money laundering rules since 2020. Over 300 firms have tried to win approval by the regulator since the regime opened, of which only 45 firms have succeeded.  Companies like crypto exchange Gemini, payments platform Revolut and asset manager Fidelity Digital Assets have landed on the register. But the process can take a while.  Participants in the crypto industry told CoinDesk last year that it took over a year for the FCA to get back to them regarding their registration application. In her remarks Thursday, Pritchard said speeding up its process may look better, but could ultimately harm consumers.  ""Lower standards could leave open our market to abuse by those who seek to launder criminally made cash, damaging market integrity and confidence in financial markets,"" Pritchard said. ""Instead, we take a longer view. Crypto‚Äôs success ‚Äì and the success of any base for crypto firms ‚Äì relies on trust being built and maintained.""

However, as investors hope for relief, it seems that the sellers are far from done, with one notable Bitcoin sell transaction in particular sending the market into a frenzy. Whale Dumps $1 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin Whale tracker Whale Alert took to X (formerly Twitter) to inform the crypto community of a large Bitcoin transaction that was participating in the sell-off. The transaction was carrying a total of 16,276 BTC which was worth around $1 billion at the time that the transaction was carried out. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are On The Move Again, But Are They Bullish Or Bearish? While large transactions are not out of the ordinary, their destination is often the determinant of whether it is a bearish or bullish transaction. In cases where the coins are headed away from centralized exchanges and into personal wallets, it can be bullish because this often means that the investors are consolidating their coins into personal private storage and don‚Äôt plan on selling. However, in cases where coins are being transferred to centralized exchanges, it can be very bearish since it often means that investors are looking to sell their coins. This was the case with the $1 billion Bitcoin transaction, as the 16,276 BTC were transferred to the Binance exchange. Naturally, the transaction caused a stir among investors who contemplated the impact that such a large sell-off could have on the price of the cryptocurrency. However, the origin of the transaction would be revealed soon after, and prices would stabilize as a result. Binance Says 16,276 BTC Transaction Was SAFU Fund Conversion In the early hours of Thursday, Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, took responsibility for the 16,276 BTC transaction that was sent to the exchange. The funds were reportedly from its emergency insurance fund known as the Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) fund. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Don‚Äôt Buy Altcoins Just Yet ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why According to the announcement, the exchange is converting this insurance fund into stable coins to avoid fluctuations in price associated with Bitcoin.

42418380,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgqpp,1713445200,Tokenization Growth Depends on Developing Blockchain-Powered Secondary Markets: Moody's,"The development of blockchain-powered secondary markets can help improve the adoption of tokenization in traditional markets, a new report by Moody's says.  Although there is a lack of these secondary markets, analysts are noting growth.  Blockchain-powered secondary markets can help expand the reach of tokenized assets, analysts at Moody's Investors Service said in a report published Thursday.  Tokenization is the representation of real-world assets on a blockchain, and financial institutions worldwide are exploring how it can improve the efficiency, cost and reach of financial markets. For example, tokenization allows large assets such as private equity or real estate to be broken down and represented by multiple tokens, opening the market to a wider range of investors, a previous report from the ratings company said.  While financial institutions and governments have started dabbling in the issuance of tokenized assets ‚Äì such as Hong Kong's $100 million green bond last year ‚Äì there is a lack of secondary markets where they can be traded after the primary offering, the Moody's analysts note.  This limits the adoption of tokenization, the new report said, adding that there is a noticeable growth in blockchain-powered secondary markets.  Blockchain and tokenization bring ""significant innovations to secondary market structures,"" and developing secondary markets for blockchain-based securities could improve liquidity management, enhance market data accessibility and facilitate instantaneous settlements, the report said.  ""These blockchain-powered secondary markets address several perceived drawbacks of traditional secondary markets, including limited accessibility of certain asset classes, inefficiencies in settlement processes, and high operational costs,"" the report said.  Though these blockchain markets promise innovation, the report warns that there are also technological and regulatory hurdles.  ""The technology underpinning these markets, primarily smart contracts, is susceptible to risks such as bugs, rug pulls, price manipulations, and oracle failures. These vulnerabilities not only pose financial risks to participants but also hinder the broader acceptance and integration of [decentralized finance],"" the report said.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/18/tokenization-growth-depends-on-developing-blockchain-powered-secondary-markets-moodys,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e28579bf0afda83476377fce74cb773ba8af5e00-1500x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) has become more dominant in the crypto market because of the impending halving and risk aversion in the broader market. The largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading below $61,400 during Asian hours on Thursday, according to CoinDesk Indices data, as the sell-off in risk assets, fueled by difficult macroeconomic conditions, raged. The CoinDesk 20, a measure of the world‚Äôs most liquid digital assets, fell 3.3% to 2,125. While bitcoin might be having a challenging moment, layer-1 blockchains and altcoins are doing worse. Top layer-1 tokens like Solana‚Äôs (SOL) are down over 20% in the past week. Avalanche's (AVAX) has fallen 26%, Cardano's (ADA) 23% and Filecoin (FIL) 30%.  Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange that was removed from India some months ago, is looking to re-enter the country by paying a $2 million fine, the Economic Times reported on Thursday. Earlier this year, Binance and some other exchanges were removed from the Apple Store in India after India‚Äôs Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) sent them compliance ""show cause"" notices. OKX, KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global and Bitfinex were the other firms that were sent notices at the time.  USDe holders should monitor the project‚Äôs reserve fund to avoid risks related to the potential of a negative funding rate, according to data provider CryptoQuant. Ethena Labs, the firm behind the stablecoin, currently offers an annual yield of 17.2%, a rolling average over the past seven days, to investors that stake USDe or other stablecoins on the platform. The yield is created from a tokenized ‚Äúcash and carry‚Äù trade that involves purchasing an asset whilst simultaneously shorting that asset to rake in funding payments. Funding is a way of keeping the asset prices on derivatives exchanges close to the underlying assets. In a bullish market, holders of long positions pay short positions and the opposite is true in a bearish market.  Chart of the Day  Past bitcoin halvings have led to substantial price gains for bitcoin in the subsequent 12 months.  The chart shows prices soared 1000%, after the first halving, 200% after the second and 600% following the third.

42418387,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgqy5,1713441600,Ondo Finance Brings Tokenized Treasuries to the Cosmos Ecosystem with Noble Integration,"RWA tokenization platform Ondo Finance has partnered with Cosmos-based Noble chain to bring its tokenized products to Cosmos.  Ondo is one of the largest players of the booming tokenized Treasury market with $300 million of deposits.  Tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance (ONDO) said Thursday that it has teamed up with asset issuance chain Noble to bring its tokenized U.S. Treasury offerings to the Cosmos {{ATOM}} ecosystem.  The first asset Ondo plans to issue natively via Noble is USDY, a tokenized note backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries offering a 5.2% annual yield, targeting the end of the second quarter of this year, a spokesperson told CoinDesk. USDY is currently available on Ethereum, Solana, Mantle and Sui.  Ondo's expansion to Cosmos means that its token offerings will be integrated to over 90 blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem, boosting adoption for its products backed by U.S. Treasuries as a yield-earning savings, payment and collateral asset.  Cosmos, often described as the ""internet of blockchains,"" is an interoperability network of individual blockchains including dYdX {{DYDX}}, Celestia {{TIA}}, Sei {{SEI}} and Injective {{INJ}}. Noble is an application-specific chain within the ecosystem designed to issue native digital assets, and Ondo will use the chain as a ""routing hub"" for liquidity within the Cosmos ecosystem.  ""Having Noble as our issuance partner will bring vastly improved utility and liquidity to appchains and their users, all while offering exposure to yielding instruments,‚Äù said Nathan Allman, founder of Ondo Finance.  Ondo Finance is one of the largest players in the $1.2 billion tokenized Treasury market, which has seen significant growth in the past year as crypto investors and digital asset companies sought safe ways to park their blockchain-based cash holdings and earn a yield. Ondo's tokenized offerings attracted over $300 million of deposits since debuting in early 2023.  Recently, traditional asset management giant BlackRock partnered with Securitize to enter the field with a Treasury-backed token BUIDL, which Ondo now uses to back its OUSG token.",POSITIVE,ONDO | TIA,MARKET | REGULATION | ONDO | TIA | TOKEN SALE,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/18/ondo-finance-brings-tokenized-treasuries-to-the-cosmos-ecosystem-with-noble-integration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12aadf777b36dc32a0cd75e657cfee15fdcd5e22-1893x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42418383,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgquz,1713441597,"DeFi‚Äôs Path to Mass Adoption Goes Through Fintech Firms, Centralized Exchanges, Morpho Labs Chief Says","Many financial technology firms and crypto exchanges have noted Coinbase's success with Base, its layer-2 blockchain, and decided to work with layer 2s themselves or build their own.  TradFi has such an advantage with its current infrastructure, there is no incentive to move to DeFi.  Neutral DeFi protocols that others can easily build on top of are a better path to scale than giant on-chain brokers or funds such as Aave or Compound.  The path to mass adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) passes through fintech firms and centralized exchanges, which together form a disruptive force with more incentive to switch to the new infrastructure than traditional finance (TradFi) incumbents, according to Paul Frambot, CEO of DeFi lending firm Morpho Labs.  Just as the auto industry, for example, has distribution and manufacturing sectors, so does finance. Financial technology companies ‚Äì fintechs ‚Äì such as Revolut and Robinhood (HOOD) provide the distribution frameworks for the digitization of financial services. But they still rely on TradFi as the manufacturer, Frambot said.  That will change, he said, and points to several pieces of evidence for his thesis that DeFi will scale through a combination of centralized crypto exchanges and fintech firms.  For instance, many fintechs and exchanges have noted the success U.S.-listed crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) has had so far with Base, its layer-2 blockchain, and decided to build or partner with layer 2s themselves, Frambot said. Robinhood in February announced it was working with layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum, and many other fintech firms now have in place wallet infrastructure to seamlessly connect with Web3.  ‚ÄúTradFi has very little interest in moving to DeFi, to be frank, just because they have such an unfair advantage with their current infrastructure,‚Äù Frambot said in an interview. ‚ÄúHowever, fintechs don't have their own financial infrastructure, they have to go through all the fees of the TradFi guys. But they have distribution, they have adoption. So if they start owning their own infrastructure by building on top of layer-2s and immutable DeFi, then they can start generating more profits from it, gain efficiency and limit their operating costs.‚Äù  ""I'm still frustrated that we're not changing finance at all,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe're still playing for crypto users that already have crypto. The promise of the open financial infrastructure underpinning every financial service is miles and miles away from where we are right now. And I think because there is so much money to make from just the crypto game, there are few incentives for founders to think beyond this.‚Äù  The answer to DeFi‚Äôs scaling problems also involves protocols that are neutral, like the rails of the internet itself, which can easily be built on top of, Frambot said. Having started out as a very successful optimization service on top of DiFi giants like Aave, using a matching engine to reduce spreads and offer users better interest rates, Morpho later transitioned to become a base-level protocol, more like Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange by trading volume on the Ethereum blockchain.  The model of a broker or fund that exists on-chain, like Aave or Compound, that is necessarily mutable and continually subject to hundreds of risk-management governance decisions will not scale to the degree required to make DeFi mainstream, in Frambot‚Äôs opinion.  ‚ÄúWe can't have [a] one-size-fits-all monolith that meets all the different compliance needs of the world,‚Äù Frambot said. ‚ÄúPeople want different [know your customer] or risk. So you have to have the core protocol that is completely un-opinionated, and people build specific financial products on top for their specific use cases.‚Äù",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | ARB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/18/defis-path-to-mass-adoption-goes-through-fintech-firms-centralized-exchanges-morpho-labs-chief-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6bdfb66bf88420f855898499799f0016aa0c438b-1280x719.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This time, his focus is on a new development on the Bitcoin network, which he believes is currently undervalued by the market. Ansem stated via X: Next 100x opp is runes on Bitcoin, 95% of CT is not paying attention to this at all compare volumes on Solana memecoins to current unisat volume & consider the wealth effect if Bitcoiners have their own native altcoins to buy provenance will b v imp here also imo. An In-depth Analysis Of Ansem‚Äôs Successes Lookonchain, a reputable on-chain analysis firm, provided an exhaustive look at Ansem‚Äôs latest trading history and strategy. Their analysis reveals a pattern of early investments in nascent cryptocurrencies that later became highly lucrative. Ansem(@blknoiz06) ‚Äì the best crypto trader who: 170x on $SOL 520x on $WIF 80x on $BONK Yesterday, he tweeted that the next 100x opp is runes on Bitcoin. 1/ üßµLet‚Äôs dig into his trading strategy. pic.twitter.com/vN2N2Aekbz ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 17, 2024 On January 1, 2021, Ansem invested in Solana when it was priced at just $1.5. By November of the same year, the value of Solana had skyrocketed to $260, a return that significantly outpaced market expectations, netting a gain of over 170x. Ansem‚Äôs acute sense of market potential was again on display with his investments in WIF and BONK. His tweet on December 12, 2023, suggesting that WIF had potential similar to SHIB (Shiba Inu), preceded a massive surge in WIF‚Äôs value from $0.09 to $4.85. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Unveils Top 10 BTCfi Altcoins Post-Halving Similarly, his endorsement of BONK led to an impressive 80x increase in its price. ‚ÄúOn October 30, 2023, Ansem tweeted ‚Äòbonk great coin‚Äô, and then BONK skyrocketed! 4 months later, BONK exceeded $0.000047,‚Äù the firm stated. Lookonchain further highlighted, ‚ÄúAnsem combines a strategic allocation of 70% in long-term holdings with 30% dedicated to short-term, speculative trades. This balanced approach helps mitigate risk while capitalizing on high-return opportunities. His success is a testament to his deep market insights, disciplined investment strategy, and timely execution.‚Äù How To Follow The Crypto Traders‚Äô Prediction In response, prominent crypto analyst Cyclop (@nobrainflip), who boasts 346,000 followers, analyzed Ansem‚Äôs current prediction. He explained that the hype revolves around a newly developed protocol named Runes, created by the inventor of Ordinals, Rodarmor. Runes allows for the issuance of fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin network, operating as a more integrated alternative to the BRC-20 protocol. Related Reading: Crypto Exchanges Bitcoin Supply Can Only Last For 9 Months, ByBit Report Unlike BRC-20, which follows an account model akin to Ethereum‚Äôs, Runes utilizes Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, potentially offering a more seamless integration with Bitcoin‚Äôs existing infrastructure. Notably, Runes are not just an alternative; they aim to replace the BRC-20 entirely. The protocol charges fees in BTC for creating tokens and is set to launch on Bitcoin‚Äôs halving day, April 19. The development of the Runes ecosystem is gaining traction, with various projects, tools, and platforms beginning to emerge. With the anticipated launch of Runes scheduled for Bitcoin‚Äôs next halving day on April 19, the ecosystem around this new protocol is quickly developing. A variety of projects are already preparing to utilize Runes, with tools, launchpads, and other resources being actively developed. The most notable, according to cyclop, are: Runecoin (RSIC): This project allows users to mine tokens in anticipation of the Runes launch. It has already distributed a 21,000 RSIC miner airdrop to over 9,000 wallets that hold Ordinal collections. Runes Terminal (RUNI): Aimed at developers, this platform is creating a test environment for Bitcoin applications that will utilize the Runes Protocol, facilitating innovation and simplification in the transition to new applications on the Bitcoin network. Pups Token (PUPS): With a pre-mint supply of 10 million tokens, this project plans an airdrop for holders of Rune Pup ordinals, who can also participate in token-burning events to reduce supply and potentially increase value. The crypto analyst also advised that the hype around Runes is just starting. The ‚ÄúOrdinals community has spurred numerous projects to offer Runes airdrops. Thanks to Magic Eden, a new tab now conveniently lists all collections confirmed to distribute Runes to holders in one place.‚Äù At press time, PUPS traded at $48.96, down 68% from its all-time high.

Among the most significant players affected is Grayscale, a leading institution in the crypto space. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Open Interest Explodes On Top Exchanges ‚Äì Is This The Comeback? Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Holdings Experience Decline Grayscale, known for its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), held the highest BTC market capitalization among institutions. However, an in-depth analysis reveals a decline in its Bitcoin holdings over recent months. From nearly 620,000 BTC in January, Grayscale‚Äôs holdings have dwindled to a little over 300,000 BTC at the time of reporting. This decline raises questions about the factors influencing institutional investment strategies in the crypto sector. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Fluctuating Flows Following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the market has witnessed fluctuating flows across various platforms. While certain ETFs have experienced significant volume, others have recorded zero flows, indicating a mixed response from investors. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT and Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC have been among the few to register notable flows, with both inflows and outflows observed in recent days. Source: Coinglass A closer look at the data reveals consecutive outflows in Bitcoin spot ETFs over the past few days, reminiscent of similar trends observed in March. On the 15th and 16th of April, outflows amounted to nearly $27 million and $58 million, respectively. Despite these outflows, analysts point out that such fluctuations are not uncommon in the ETF market and may not necessarily indicate product failure. Analysis Of Flow Patterns Provides Insight Examining specific flow patterns offers valuable insights into investor behavior and market sentiment. While Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC experienced consecutive outflows, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT saw inflows on certain days. This variance underscores the diverse strategies adopted by investors in response to the evolving crypto landscape. Bitcoin market cap currently at $1.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com It‚Äôs important to note that zero inflows on certain days are considered normal for ETFs, according to analysts. They emphasized that such occurrences are commonplace across various ETFs and should not be interpreted as a sign of product failure. Instead, they reflect the ebb and flow of investor interest in a rapidly evolving market. Future Outlook For Bitcoin ETFs As Bitcoin ETFs continue to gain traction, the market is poised for further evolution. While some platforms may experience fluctuations in flows, the overall trajectory of institutional investment in the crypto sector remains optimistic.

The bank‚Äôs analysis shows that the cryptocurrency remains overbought.  Miners will be most affected by the event, the report said.  The bitcoin {{BTC}} price is likely to weaken after the reward halving, a quadrennial event that slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply and looks set to occur around April 19-20, Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.  The bank sees downside for the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency after the halving because the market is still in overbought conditions, according to its analysis of open interest in bitcoin futures.  Furthermore, the cryptocurrency price of about $61,200 is still above the bank‚Äôs volatility-adjusted comparison with gold, which sets it at $45,000, and its projected production cost of $42,000 after the halving. The bitcoin production cost has historically acted as a lower boundary for BTC prices.  JPMorgan also notes that venture-capital funding remains subdued despite the recent crypto market resurgence.  The biggest impact of the halving will be felt by mining companies: ‚ÄúAs unprofitable bitcoin miners exit the bitcoin network, we anticipate a significant drop in the hashrate and consolidation among bitcoin miners with a highest share for publicly-listed bitcoin miners,‚Äù analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  ‚ÄúPost halving event, it is also likely that some bitcoin mining firms may look to diversify into low energy cost regions such as Latin America or Africa to deploy their inefficient mining rigs to gain salvage values from those rigs which would otherwise sit idle,‚Äù the authors wrote.

42418394,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgr6L,1713428345,Bearish Flip in Crypto Crowd Sentiment Hints at Coming Bitcoin Price Bounce,"Social media metrics suggest crypto followers are beginning to adopt a bearish attitude on bitcoin's price trajectory.  Historically, bearish crowd sentiment has been observed at market bottoms.  ""The masses are always wrong. Wisdom is doing everything the crowd does not do,"" American poet and novelist Charles Bukowski said.  That holds true for crypto too, and the crypto crowd is beginning to lean bearish on bitcoin {{BTC}} ‚Äì a sign the current BTC price sell-off may soon run out of steam.  ""Historically, prices move in the opposite direction of mass traders' expectations,"" blockchain analytics platform Santiment said in a market insights post, adding the market could bottom out right before the halving ‚Äì expected in the next two days ‚Äì or shortly after.  Data tracked by Santiment shows that the number of ""bull market"" or ""bull cycle"" mentions on crypto social media has been declining since late March. At the same time, the number of ""bear market"" or ""bear cycle"" mentions steadily increased.  Santiment's Social Trends indicator tracks chatter across Telegram, Reddit, X and 4Chan to identify keywords or topics that have sparked interest.  ""According to the crypto crowd, the #bullmarket has essentially come to an end after #Bitcoin's -16% market value drop since the #AllTimeHigh of $73,600 hit back on March 14th. At the same time, #bearmarket mentions are increasing,"" Santiment said.  The number of mentions for other keywords like ""buy the dip"" also indicates that ""hopium ‚Äù ‚Äì crypto slang for hopes of a quick recovery and a continued bull run ‚Äì among retail investors has faded. Historically, a decline in the ""buy the dip"" mentions has marked the end of downtrends.  The dwindling probability of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, heightened geopolitical tensions and timing for U.S. tax payments have weighed on bitcoin this month, leading to a 14% price slide.

Ethena generates a yield through a tokenized ""cash and carry trade.""  CryptoQuant says Ethena would need to maintain a keep rate above 32% in the event of a bear market.  USDe holders should monitor the project‚Äôs reserve fund to avoid risks related to the potential of a negative funding rate, according to data provider CryptoQuant.  Ethena Labs, the firm behind the USDe stablecoin, currently offers an annual yield of 17.2%, a rolling average over the past seven days, to investors that stake USDe or other stablecoins on the platform. The yield is created from a tokenized ‚Äúcash and carry‚Äù trade that involves purchasing an asset whilst simultaneously shorting that asset to rake in funding payments.  Funding is a way of keeping the asset prices on derivatives exchanges close to the underlying assets. In a bullish market, holders of long positions pay short positions and vice versa in a bearish market.  CryptoQuant warns that when funding rates become negative for a prolonged period of time, Ethena‚Äôs short positions will be required to make substantial payments to those holding longs.  Ethena has allocated capital to a reserve fund for this purpose, but that fund will have to grow significantly if the market cap of USDe continues to increase.  Using examples of ether {{ETH}} funding rates following the Merge upgrade and the FTX collapse, a CryptoQuant report suggests that the current reserve fund of $32.7 million would only be able to sustain funding payments if USDe‚Äôs market cap were below $4 billion and $3 billion respectively. The market cap of USDe has risen to $2.3 billion two months after being issued.  The report adds that Ethena‚Äôs keep rate, which is the portion of revenue that gets allocated to the reserve fund, would need to remain above a certain level depending on funding rates in order to be sustainable.  ‚ÄúIn order for Ethena to withstand a bear market period,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúIt would need to sustain a keep rate above 32%.

25954847,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603807,1713426314,"No Fed Rate Cuts? No Worries For Bitcoin, Says Research Firm","As the US economy grapples with rising inflation expectations and scaled-back forecasts for Federal Reserve rate cuts, the Bitcoin market remains buoyant, according to a detailed analysis by Reflexivity Research. With the US CPI headline inflation projected to accelerate to 4.8% by the November 2024 elections, according to Bank of America, conditions are seemingly unfavorable for a loosening of monetary policy. Despite this, the cryptocurrency sector, particularly Bitcoin, appears insulated and optimistic. Bitcoin Unfazed By Delayed Rate Cuts? The bond market now anticipates only three Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, a significant reduction from the earlier forecast of six. The CME FedWatch tool indicates that the majority of market participants do not expect a rate cut to occur before the mid-September FOMC meeting. This adjustment reflects a recalibration of expectations regarding the Fed‚Äôs capacity to manage persistent inflation pressures. Amidst these macroeconomic shifts, Ritik Goyal, in a guest post for Reflexivity Research, presents a compelling analysis in his report titled ‚ÄúThe Fed is Unable to Cause a Recession. Risk Assets are Yet to Realize This.‚Äù Related Reading: Pre-Halving Jitters: Bitcoin Price Briefly Slips Below $60,000 The report argues that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes have had unintended stimulative effects on the economy. Goyal elucidates three specific mechanisms through which this phenomenon operates: 1. Increased Government Interest Payments: ‚ÄúRate hikes raised interest payments by the government to the private sector,‚Äù Goyal notes. As the Fed raises rates, it increases the interest burden on the government, which has borrowed extensively during the post-COVID period. With the federal debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 120%, the doubled interest payments now effectively act as a stimulus, channeling approximately $1 trillion annually to the private sector 2. Direct Subsidy to Banking System: The Fed‚Äôs policy adjustments have also led to a redistribution of wealth within the financial system. ‚ÄúRate hikes raised the Fed‚Äôs direct subsidy to the banking system,‚Äù states Goyal. This has occurred as the yield curve inversion resulted in the Fed incurring losses on its balance sheet, losses that directly benefit the banking sector, translating to an estimated $150 billion annual subsidy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Displays Bullish Adam And Eve Double Bottom: What It Means 3. Induced Housing Construction Boom: The rate hikes have paradoxically stimulated the housing market. ‚ÄúRate hikes induced a housing construction boom,‚Äù according to Goyal. As higher rates discourage existing homeowners from selling, the only viable option to meet housing demand is new construction, a sector with one of the highest GDP multipliers. Goyal‚Äôs insights underline a critical misalignment in the Fed‚Äôs current approach against the backdrop of substantial fiscal interventions since the pandemic. ‚ÄúThe traditional monetary policy framework is breaking down under the weight of fiscal dominance,‚Äù Goyal concludes, suggesting an environment that could favor non-traditional assets like Bitcoin. Echoing Goyal‚Äôs findings, crypto expert Will Clemente highlighted the broader implications for cryptocurrencies on X (formerly Twitter), stating, ‚ÄúWith debt/GDP as high as it is, we‚Äôre in a backwards world where high rates mean interest payments on debt are stimmy checks for people that buy assets‚Äî~$1T will be paid out in 2024.

The memecoin reached a high of $0.00002296 after experiencing a temporary dip to $0.00002092 just the day before. Source: CoinMarketCap Related Reading: Whale Alert: MATIC Poised For Epic Surge ‚Äì Time To Dive In? Open Interest Surge Signals Market Activity A key indicator of this newfound interest in Shiba Inu lies in the surge of open interest observed across major exchanges. Leading the charge are exchanges like Huobi and OKX, where Shiba Inu‚Äôs open interest soared to nearly $16 million and $15 million, respectively. Source: Coinalyze This surge in open interest reflects heightened market activity and suggests a growing number of investors are actively engaging with Shiba Inu futures contracts. Mixed Sentiment Persists Among Traders Despite the surge in open interest and the subsequent price rally, sentiment among traders remains mixed. While there is evident optimism driving the market, reflected in the increase in open interest, the Long/Short Ratio paints a nuanced picture. SHIB market cap currently at $12.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Currently standing at 0.94, the Long/Short Ratio indicates that more traders are betting on a potential price drop for Shiba Inu. This divergence in sentiment adds a layer of complexity to the market dynamics surrounding Shiba Inu. Leveraged Trading Statistics And On-Chain Indicators Examining the market, statistics on leveraged trading offer additional insights into the current state of SHIB. Across exchanges like Bitget, CoinEx, BingX, Huobi, OKX, Kraken, and BitMex, open interest for Shiba Inu futures contracts stands at a staggering 2.40 trillion SHIB tokens. While exchanges like Bitget lead the pack with significant gains in open interest, others like BingX and CoinEx also show notable increases. Related Reading: Elon Musk Latest Tweet: How Much Did Dogecoin Gain From It Today? Furthermore, on-chain indicators present a bullish outlook for Shiba Inu, despite the fluctuations in price and market sentiment. A consistent decline in SHIB tokens held on exchanges since the onset of the bull market in October 2023 suggests that long-term investors maintain confidence in Shiba Inu‚Äôs potential. This trend persists even amidst recent market dips in March and April, highlighting the resilience of Shiba Inu‚Äôs investor base. Navigating Shiba Inu‚Äôs Market Dynamics While the recent surge in price and open interest signals renewed interest and activity, the divergence in trader sentiment underscores the inherent uncertainty of the market. Nevertheless, with on-chain indicators pointing towards long-term confidence, Shiba Inu remains a cryptocurrency to watch closely in the days to come.

25940383,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=603754,1713407432,"Pre-Halving Jitters: Bitcoin Price Briefly Slips Below $60,000","The Bitcoin price has recently experienced heightened volatility, causing the largest cryptocurrency in the market to briefly drop below the significant threshold of $60,000 for the first time since March 5. This price decrease comes just days before the highly anticipated Halving event scheduled for Friday. This event has traditionally been viewed as a positive catalyst for Bitcoin‚Äôs value due to its impact on token supply. However, market participants are questioning whether the Halving‚Äôs effects are already factored into the current market conditions, leading to extended bearish sentiment. Long-Term Bullish Outlook Prevails Bitcoin‚Äôs decline saw it plummet by 5% to $59,890, though it recovered some losses shortly afterward. Since reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 on March 14, the Bitcoin price has now retraced by approximately 18%. The downward trend extended to other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), which also experienced slumps on Wednesday. The impending Halving, a quadrennial code update in Bitcoin, has raised concerns among investors as to whether it will be a significant market-moving event or a non-event overshadowed by other factors, such as the ongoing discussions surrounding the Bitcoin ETF market, which has seen a significant decrease in terms of outflows. Related Reading: Crypto Exchanges Bitcoin Supply Can Only Last For 9 Months, ByBit Report Nathana√´l Cohen, co-founder of INDIGO Fund, noted that market participants are de-risking due to this uncertainty and the additional macro factor of tensions in the Middle East involving Israel and Iran, putting further pressure on risk assets. The recent decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs price was further exacerbated by a wave of liquidations in long positions for digital assets. Last Friday alone, approximately $780 million worth of bullish crypto wagers were liquidated within 24 hours. Despite the recent market turbulence, some participants maintain a bullish long-term outlook for Bitcoin. Some see the recent liquidations and subsequent flushing out of leverage in the crypto market as a positive development. Ravi Doshi, head of markets at FalconX, reported increased buying of longer-dated call options on their derivatives desk, suggesting that clients anticipate higher prices in the latter half of the year. Bitcoin Price Rebounds Above $61,000 Following the brief dip below the $60,000 mark, the Bitcoin price has rebounded, currently trading at $61,600. This recovery is viewed as a bullish sign, with the cryptocurrency‚Äôs macro uptrend structure remaining intact as long as price levels of $51,000 and $42,000 are maintained. The market is closely watching whether the theory suggesting that the Halving price catalyst is already factored into the current market conditions holds. Additionally, the performance of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States and their potential impact on driving the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price back to previous highs are of significant interest. Related Reading: 69% Of PEPE Holders Left In Profits After 26% Plunge Furthermore, the recent approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF market in Hong Kong is expected to contribute to increased adoption of the leading cryptocurrency. Although some experts do not consider it as significant as the US ETF market, it is anticipated to generate a surge in price and further strengthen Bitcoin‚Äôs position. Ultimately, the outcome of the Halving event, combined with the developments in both the US and Hong Kong ETF markets, remains uncertain. The ability of Bitcoin to regain its bullish momentum and drive increased demand will be closely monitored.

In an update on April 16, Offchain Labs‚ÄìArbitrum developers‚Äìsaid they have deployed the permissionless version of their fraud proofs, dubbed Bounded Liquidity Delay (BOLD), to testnet. Ethereum Layer-2s Are Popular, But There Is A Big Problem Ethereum layer-2 solutions have been gaining prominence over the years. According to L2Beat data on April 17, these platforms control over $37 billion of assets. Protocol developers and users can send transactions cheaply through Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and other alternatives. However, while they are popular and command billions in TVL, most of these platforms‚Äô fraud proofs are being developed. Typically, when users transact all chains, all transactions must be confirmed by a web of miners or validators, depending on the consensus mechanism. Related Reading: Whale Alert: MATIC Poised For Epic Surge ‚Äì Time To Dive In? This differs in layer-2 options, which must reroute transactions and process them off-chain. There is no way of proving whether queued transactions are valid before being batched and confirmed on-chain. The fraud proofs, such as those presented by Arbitrum and other optimistic rollup solutions, are designed to address a critical issue in layer-2 solutions. Specifically, once live and integrated into Arbitrum, BOLD will serve as a safety net, ensuring the validity of transactions processed off-chain. This mechanism is crucial in maintaining the integrity of transactions while enabling efficient off-chain processing. In compliance with blockchain principles, BOLD will be decentralized. As such, the community will run nodes, which differs from the current setup. As it is, transaction validation in Arbitrum is centralized, and only a few validators are tasked with this. Arbitrum Deploys BOLD In Testnet, ARB Prices Falling With BOLD in the testnet, Arbitrum is opening up its rails so that anyone can participate in network security and validate withdrawals back to Ethereum. This move will be critical in building a more decentralized ecosystem and making the platform more robust. Arbitrum becomes the first Ethereum layer-2 to launch its fraud proofs in testnet. In a post on X, Ryan Watts of Optimism also¬†notified¬†the community that plans are underway to create a decentralized fraud-proof system for the second-most largest layer-2 by TVL. Even with this major milestone, ARB prices are stable and under pressure.

Hopes For Second ‚ÄòDeFi Summer‚Äô Per the report, DeFi experienced a significant resurgence in Q1‚Äô24, fueled by a surge in developer and user activity, particularly on chains like Solana (SOL) and Base. This resurgence has sparked growing hopes of a second ‚ÄòDeFi Summer,‚Äô as DeFi projects embrace new concepts such as staking, liquid staking, restaking, and liquid restaking, which have been catalysts for its growth. Notably, staking now represents a substantial portion of DeFi‚Äôs Total Value Locked (TVL).

Furthermore, DeFi led in fees spent, gas usage, and the overall number of projects despite comprising only approximately 4% of the total crypto market cap. The TVL for yield-generating protocols within DeFi witnessed steady growth, climbing from $26.5 billion in Q3‚Äô23 to $59.7 billion in Q1‚Äô24. According to QuickNode, this rally signifies a return of confidence and liquidity to the DeFi markets as investors seek opportunities for yield generation. Players Take Control With Web3 Gaming In parallel, Web3-based gaming has emerged as a significant departure from conventional gaming platforms. By leveraging cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Web3 gaming offers players new and decentralized gaming. Players now have the opportunity to actively participate in games and earn rewards, shifting control away from centralized entities within the gaming ecosystem. The report highlights the growth of Web3 gaming, surpassing stablecoins in transaction volume and achieving the highest year-over-year (YoY) active address growth across all categories, with a 155% increase in active addresses during Q1 ‚Äô24. This surge in player engagement and participation is evident through the exponential growth of transactions within Web3 gaming, which experienced a staggering 370% YoY increase. The Appeal Of Stablecoins Although stablecoins continue to lead in daily active users, representing over 41% of all Web3 user activity, other categories have shown higher quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) activity growth, indicating potential catch-up. Tether‚Äôs USDT remains the dominant stablecoin, controlling approximately 75% of the market cap. Notably, Circle‚Äôs USDC has taken the lead in volume and average transaction size, partly due to Coinbase‚Äôs efforts to integrate USDC on its platform and promote its use on its Layer 2 network, Base.

QuickNode attributes the surge in stablecoin user activity in Q1‚Äô24 to several factors, including the approval and listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the anticipation of Bitcoin‚Äôs next Halving event, the devaluation of fiat currencies, the popularity of low-volatility assets, and the strength of the USD, to which over 90% of stablecoin transactions are anchored.
