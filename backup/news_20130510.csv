42424860,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrTh,1368208183,Cash is not the enemy of bitcoin,"This week in the newsroom, the question came up as to why couldn’t Facebook launch a distributed, secure network and run currency and exchanges over it. It already has the user base. What’s to stop them?  This is almost certainly going through the minds of leaders at other large technology companies. Apple users are petitioning the company to allow digital wallet apps on the iPhone. Yet so far, the company has said no.  Why? Perhaps there is a chance that it will launch its own currency. Other big retailers already have. Earlier this week, we outlined the reasons that large retailers are aggressively targeting such moves. Basically, they want your cash.  And what is the one thing that bitcoin, litecoin and all the other digital coins don’t yet have? Trust from the masses. Acceptance. A way to pay.  If the currency market suddenly explodes with tokens from, well, anyone who wants to launch a new currency, we might end up seeing a Betamax and VHS war rerun: a battle not among the open-source technologies (such as bitcoin and litecoin) themselves, but between- open and closed-source currencies. Corporate vs. community.  One has the masses. The other has geeks. Does that remind you of any technology battles that have been fought before? Windows vs. Linux. iOS vs. Android.  It's not for CoinDesk to say whether that's a battle between good and evil. But the bitcoin community should be thinking about corporate currency more than cash. Cash could actually be a friend to bitcoin in comparison.  Whether bitcoin is successful or not is almost irrelevant when you look at currency this way. Something that looks a lot like bitcoin will almost certainly find wide acceptance. But it will have its downsides.  For example, the lack of institutions such as banks -- which, as poor as they are with customer trust, are likely to be the hub of economies for some time.  A bank for bitcoin -- or a similar currency -- would have to do a lot of work on branding and PR to be accepted as ""safe"" and ""trustworthy"". As does the currency itself. It's not that there's anything wrong with the technology. But it has yet to win the battle of perception [enter corporate PR stage right].  Traditional banks get away with this because a lot of those perceptions are inherited. They are old. They are based in big stone 'safe' buildings. But perhaps our perceptions are changing too. A lot of people have moved from iOS to Android because it's a brilliant system. Technology is causing us to constantly challenge our perceptions of what is acceptable.  Acceptance is the battle for open-source currency. For corporate currencies, it’s more likely to be getting the balance right with transparency, ethics and usability.  Corporate currencies can offer benefits quickly -- such as cheaper goods in exchange for tokens. But how much will the companies behind them tell you about what they’re doing with the money they ""store"" for you?  That piece smells a lot like fractional reserve lending. And as everyone has seen – that system works while currency is moving around. It works while people trade and there is cash flow. But when people start asking for their money back (say, from a company that was looking likely to go bust), walls start to tumble.  Then again ... what, really, is digital currency? A lot of regular money is digital now. Is that open source? Is it closed source? Isn't that what this is all pegged to?  Witnessing digital currency's fits and starts toward maturity is unquestionably one of the most interesting developments we have seen since the internet began. But it won’t be a smooth ride.  Opportunity, you say? Perhaps. But there are some big battles to be fought first. And only the first few contenders have even turned up yet.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LTC | TECHNOLOGY,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/10/cash-is-not-the-enemy-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33a5231b25a459df858dc30c5f6692257e48eca2-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424875,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrjh,1368204581,Bitcoin Riddle offers BTC prizes,"For those for whom figuring out how to use bitcoins isn't challenge enough, there's now Bitcoin Riddle.  A project by reddit user Fab1anFab1an, Bitcoin Riddle is to the diehard cryptocurrency fan what the New York Times Sunday crossword is to the more linguistically inclined.  ""This is actually quite fun to watch,""  commented Bitcoin Forum user Bitcoinm. ""I'm surprised people are able to figure these out, most look pretty tricky.""  For each puzzle, Bitcoin Riddle offers an obvious prize: solve the mystery of the private bitcoin key, and the currency in the account is yours. Riddle Number Eight (""The Savage Beast""), for example, promised a reward of 0.2 BTC ... around $24 or a little over £15.  By all appearances, solving the riddles is not for the faint-hearted or numerically challenged.  ""The Savage Beast,"" for example, was ""mind blowing,"" wrote reddit user Bitco. ""Got stuck analyzing the translations of hieroglyphs that mention hunting :p""  In addition to offering a bit of bitcoin to puzzle-solvers, Bitcoin Riddle also encourages site visitors to donate to the next pot at the bitcoin address 1PfE9rrwbimLa5xcpQpueLAhmEDBdwpHvU.  While each riddle starts with three basic clues, would-be puzzle-solvers can also access additional, bonus hints. For now, those extra hints are free, but it appears that Bitcoin Riddle will eventually start charging for those (a suggested price of 0.003 BTC, or around $0.36 is given with one hint), with the funds going toward the next puzzle's prize pot.  (And, yes, once the riddle is solved, the still-frustrated can view the solution online. For example, the answer to Riddle Number Six: ""The Way of the Satoshi"" -- with the clues 1) 2.05, 5.50, 2) http://imgur.com/EsKlPig and 3) https://cryptobin.org/f250h2q1 -- was ""Leo & Victoria"". Getting that answer involved, among other things, identifying a Martian crater (""Victoria,"" with the coordinates 2.05 and 5.50) and using the nonce value from bitcoin's genesis block for decrypting on cryptobin.)

42424863,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrRh,1368200591,"Cash of the titans, bitcoin diets and ATMs: The CoinDesk Weekly Review","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.    Digital currency has many mysteries. Who created bitcoin? How does an umpire use it to decide who goes into bat first? And if the whole idea is to remove transaction costs and expensive intermediaries, just like real cash, who’s going to make any money?  But it doesn’t pay to be too skeptical at the beginning of a bright new age, especially when so many entrepreneurs are queuing up to build exciting and profitable digital currency outfits. One such is Evan Rose, co-founder and CEO of BitcoinATM. This -- oh, you’ve guessed -- is a physical cashpoint, just like the ones in the high street, which happens to accept and dispense the eponymous e-dosh.  Rose demonstrated a prototype bitcoin ATM in LA at the the end of last week. This, he said, would solve the problems of it all being too technical and weird for the average punter, and could even let you carry your virtual stash around on paper in a real wallet. John Law couldn’t agree more: if you don’t think cryptocurrency is costly and confusing, you ain’t tried it yet.  There are just a couple of tiny snags. First, bitcoin transactions take ten minutes -- on a good day. Only muggers and beggars hang around cashpoints that long. That’s OK, says Rose, you can monitor progress on your mobile. (But then, do you need an ATM at all?) The other small issue is our old friends the regulators, who want to see $25 million or so posted as a being-good bond before you can do street banking. We’ll work with people who already have such things, says Rose.  All this was too rich for one Jeff Berwick, who had been signed up by Rose some time previously (over Skype, while looking for gold in Ghana: Berwick is nothing if not colorful) to do marketing and venture capital work for BitcoinATM. Berwick explains why he parted company on the site he runs, otherwise devoted to surviving the destruction of the dollar and the grinding underfoot of the regulators. Nobody is as devoted to total removal of government as he, he claims proudly.  Perhaps not the ideal partner to help ease bitcoin onto the high street. Rule one, man: don’t scare the straights.  Bitcoin: the path to righteousness  Over at Forbes, one of the staff journalists has been writing up her week living on just bitcoins. Kashmir Hill went Tuesday to Tuesday on five BTC, around $600 worth. That seems comfortably over minimum wage -- even in San Francisco, where Hill took the plunge. After all, there can’t be anywhere more in tune with digital currency. It won’t be long before San Fran’s famously outgoing panhandlers find a way to take it.  So you’d think. Instead, Hill discovered, bitcoin is the key to health and moral rectitude. You can’t get taxis with it, so you walk and cycle everywhere. And while you can order up the illicit stimulant of your choice via Silk Road, you can’t buy a latte for love nor digits. As for food: it helps enormously if you’re vegan; you’re not going to get a Big Mac, but most of the people who take bitcoin for services or products are cyber-idealists with a hipster streak. A week of what she called the Bitcoin Diet and she’d lost five pounds.  All good clean fun, and John Law admires her resourcefulness in just about keeping body and soul together in a city where she could no longer pay for yoga sessions. Some existential issues defied easy fixes -- there was no way to pay for her mobile phone service in BTC, but she needed it to run her wallet through which all her transactions took place.  The worst thing? Violent currency fluctuations. The best thing? San Francisco has loads of people who really want to make cryptocurrency work, and there’s a real start-of-something buzz, magnified by the need to work hard just to make it happen at all. Especially heroic without coffee.  And there’s a belief, which even the cynics admit to if you catch them in a good mood, that it doesn’t matter overly if bitcoin itself doesn’t pan out in the long term. Something like it will.  Where there’s a bit, there’s a writ  Mostly, of course, if you want to spend your cryptocash, you have to convert it into the coin of the realm. That’s where the real money-generating action is, with loads of people setting up various forms of exchange. The business is dominated, however, by the mighty Mt. Gox, the Japanese-based trading house that handles around 80 percent of the global action.  There are downsides to being in Japan, mostly revolving around the rather expensive and regulator-vulnerable need to move lots of real currency in and out of the big markets in the US and Europe. Which is why US-based Coinlab stepped up with lots of stateside moxie and inked a deal with the land of the rising sums. Coinlab would extend Mt. Gox’ reach and provide some top tech; Mt Gox would have the profile and experience (albeit painfully earned) of dealing with large numbers of transactions. And Coinlab would get exclusive rights to Mt Gox’ US business for a couple of years.  Oh dear. It all sounded so good ... but turned out so bad. Last week, Coinlab hit Mt. Gox with a legal claim for $75 million because of ""contractual issues"". As well as providing lots of lawyers with the wherewithal to buy all the coffee they could drink, it was also blamed for a midweek slump in BTC.  John Law is not surprised. These are febrile days, and if you can’t afford to lose your shirt when dabbling in digital currency - or investing in startups -- you should keep it firmly on your back. Nobody knows what the risks are, except for large; nobody knows how up the upside might be. And nobody knows when the fiscal fog of war will lift.  Yet even as the lawyers cluster and journalists faint for lack of caffeine, there is good news. For bitcoin itself isn’t touched by any of this: the technology continues to work, no matter what outrageous fun us analogue humans have with it. That’s the digital gold at the heart of the standard, and like gold it will adapt to the economic ups and downs and frantic experimentalism.  Hang on tight.    John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude.

42424878,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrrh,1368179614,Users plead Apple for Bitcoin wallets,"An aggrieved user has started a petition to force Apple to approve bitcoin wallet applications for its shiny iPhones.  San Francisco gent Joshua Seims has started the petition on change.org to request Apple change its policy.  The petition says:  ""To:  Apple  Please allow Bitcoin wallets on the iPhone.  We need a mobile Bitcoin client, and if Apple won't deliver one, we'll move to Android.""  Apple has already removed several bitcoin wallets citing terms of service and developers' obligation to obey local laws wherever their apps are available - even though no nation has yet banned Bitcoin. Another reason might be Apple's unwillingness to let go of mobile payments.  There are several 'bitcoin' applications available on iTunes for keeping an eye on exchange rates or to monitor mining rigs, but none have wallet functions.  We wish Mr Seims good luck with his quest but he might like to start looking at Samsung and HTC phones...  The petition, currently with 225 supporters, is here.

42424862,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrVh,1368178591,Bitcoin-backed 'Wiki Weapon' plans go dark,"A Texas nonprofit that garnered worldwide media attention for producing the first 3D printed gun -- and raised funds in bitcoins to help pay for the project -- has removed the blueprints for the weapon from its website.  Twenty-five-year-old University of Texas law student Cody Wilson runs a company called Defense Distributed, which he calls ""Home of the Wiki Weapon Project."" Earlier this week, the company posted files with details on how to print a weapon called ""the Liberator"" at its DEFCAD site. On Thursday, however, those files were ""removed from public access at the request of the US Department of Defense Trade Controls,"" the site announced.  ""Until further notice, the United States government claims control of the information,"" the site added.  Wilson originally sought to raise funds for his printed gun project through crowdsourcing at Indiegogo, which removed his project citing breach of company rules, according to the Guardian. Wilson later collected $20,000 worth of bitcoin donations to help pay for the project. However, his first 3D printer was repossessed by the printer company, Stratasys, when the company learned of his plans.  Following news of the 3D-printed gun, US Congressman Steve Israel renewed calls for passage of his Undetectable Firearms Modernization Act, which would make it illegal to ""manufacture, own, transport, buy, or sell any firearm, receiver, or magazine that is homemade and not detectable by metal detector and/or does not present an accurate image when put through an x-ray machine.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/10/bitcoin-backed-wiki-weapon-plans-go-dark,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bb453da5a75e0447d0d8557e98297289827e109-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
