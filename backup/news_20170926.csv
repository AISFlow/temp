42379896,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LEkj,1506454240,Watch: Jesse Ventura Moderates Colorado Governor Candidates in Bitcoin Debate,"Two candidates jockeying for Colorado's 2018 gubernatorial election threw their support behind cryptocurrencies during a debate over the weekend.  Appearing during the Nexus Conference in Aspen, Democrat Erik Underwood and Republican Lew Gaiter spoke about privacy, voting and issues facing the Colorado cannabis industry – and how cryptocurrencies and blockchain can fit into the equation. Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Venture, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees and Christina Tobin, the founder of The Free and Equal Elections Foundation, moderated the debate.  Underwood and Gaiter are among a broad slate of candidates vying for the Colorado governorship, with the actual vote set for next November. Per the Denver Post, as many as ten candidates are planning to enter the race or are preparing to do so.  Gaiter, commissioner for Colorado's Larimer County, voiced support for blockchain in the public sector, calling for the state to take a more leading role among other regions in the US.  ""We need to become more technology friendly and I think that blockchain, cryptocurrency is a great place where we can be leading-edge,"" he said.  Underwood, a former Republican candidate for the US Senate now seeking the Democratic nomination, also advocated for the government to play a role.  He even said that he is developing a plan for a Colorado-based cryptocurrency that would be used to help alleviate banking and payment issues in the state's cannabis industry. Colorado voters approved the legalization of both the use and sale of marijuana in 2012.  ""I have a plan to create a cryptocurrency for Colorado. And what this cryptocurrency will do is that it will link up with the cannabis industry, so we know exactly how much we're taking in for taxes.""  Both Gaiter and Underwood said that they would defend any use of cryptocurrency or blockchain by Colorado in the event of pressure from the US government, with Underwood saying that he would take the issue to court if need be.  ""We do what's best for Coloradans. And to answer Governor Ventura's question, we'll go to court if necessary,"" said Underwood.  A recording of the debate can be found below.

42379899,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LElz,1506448804,Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Co-Authors Plan for Interactive ICO Protocol,"A new white paper has been published detailing a potentially transformative protocol for initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The protocol, which would seek to produce an ""equilibrium"" between capped and uncapped token sales, represents a collaborative effort between ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and developer Jason Teutsch, the creator of smart contract scalability project TrueBit.  In the white paper, released today, the authors detail a system by which an ICO could respond to the actions of buyers. Specifically, buyers would submit a valuation table via a smart contract that would enable them to make purchases dynamically relative to a real-time valuation.  More simply, the new ICO protocol would give buyers the option to withdraw investment bids on tokens, while evaluating the buyer's stake relative to the entire ICO and shifting bids accordingly.  In this way, it seeks to solve the problem of ICO sales selling out too quickly, or not at all.  While very much in early stages, it notably follows a flood of ICOs in the past few months that have alarmed industry participants while stoking equal optimism the use case could one day democratize venture funding.  On Medium, Teutsch spoke to this gap between the bigger vision and the present state, writing:  ""I hope that the present foray into algorithmic game theory will encourage our community to continue to think explicitly about assumptions and goals for crowdsales as we experiment with and build upon the trustless, cryptoeconomic power of smart contracts.""

Of note for traders is that the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate has moved past the falling trend line hurdle. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has gained 4.72% in the last 24 hours. At press time, BTC/USD is trading at $3,950 levels; up 1% week-on-week, but still down 9% on a monthly basis.  The recent lethargic price action in bitcoin is mainly due to investors waiting on the sidelines as they seek clarity out of China on the fate of its domestic bitcoin exchanges. Already, there is speculation that the exchange ""ban,"" which took place suddenly this month, but was never formalized, may be temporary.  However, the fact that bitcoin has breached the falling trend line hurdle tells us that investors are treating no news out of China as good news. Slowly but surely, investors are veering toward a bullish outlook.  For now, that means price action analysis certainly favors the bulls.  Daily chart  The chart above shows the trend line sloping downward from the September 2 high and September 8 high has been breached. It marks the end of the lower highs pattern.  As discussed yesterday, the move added credence to last week's bullish doji reversal and higher lows pattern, and has opened doors for $4,200-$4,300.  The break above the trend line hurdle has also increased the odds of bitcoin repeating the July pattern- rebound from the 100-day moving average in the wake of an oversold RSI, followed by a rally to record highs.  Only an end of the day close below Monday's low of $3,669 would abort the bullish view.

In a new blog post, Wilson recounted his experiences during the dot-com boom and bust of the late 1990s and early 2000s, during which a number of then-well-known internet firms rose to prominence and subsequently failed, taking many investors with them.  Wilson said that he lost as much as 90% of his net worth at the time, saved only by a pair of real estate holdings. It's that experience, he wrote, that has informed his investment decisions ever since – including the choice to keep a diversified portfolio that includes other assets along with cryptocurrencies.  Relating a conversation with a friend, he said the two discussed ""inevitability of a massive crash"" in the cryptocurrency space, writing:  ""I am certain the big crash will happen. I don’t know when it will happen and I think it may be some time before it does.""  Experiences in the dot-com crash aside, Wilson stated that he still believes people should invest in the market.  ""I have advocated many times on this blog that people should have some percentage of their net worth in crypto,"" he wrote. ""I have suggested as much as 10% or even 20% for people who are young or who are true believers. I continue to believe that and advocate for that.""  That said, Wilson isn't saying that people should go all-in on the market. Quite the contrary: in his post, Wilson called for the kind of smart investment planning that he he learned about ""the hard way"" when the tech bubble collapsed.  ""I wish I had done it during the internet boom. I did not, but the next time we made a bunch of money, I did. I learned the hard way. I share my story so that others don’t have to,"" he wrote.

Following its emergence as a global leader in bitcoin and cryptocurrency volume, local exchange startup Korbit has announced that PC and mobile gaming firm Nexon has signed a stock trading agreement that would see it acquire Korbit's management rights.  According to local news source, Hankyung, Nexon has agreed to purchase a 65 percent stake in Korbit at a sale price of 91.3 billion Korean won (roughly $80 million).  Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that Korbit sees roughly 11,500 BTC in daily trading, volumes that place it in the top 15 bitcoin exchanges globally.  As evidence that domestic interest is expanding to corporates, Nexon reportedly acquired Korbit to diversify its business, the news source said, further indicating that the gaming firm believes the blockchain market will grow in coming years.

According to a report by Bloomberg today, as many as 10 companies have reported issues in recent weeks. Anson Zeall, head of Singapore's cryptocurrency and blockchain industry association, ACCESS, supported the claim, stating the closures remain unexplained by the banks. Further, he urged the country's authorities to take a stance on the matter.  ""We would urge Singapore to take a leadership role and demonstrate how to come to an effective resolution among all parties,"" Zeall said.  However, any support may not be forthcoming.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country's central bank, told Bloomberg that it doesn't interfere with commercial decisions taken by individual banks. The central bank added it was the responsibility of the banks in question to establish operational protocols to ensure they comply with fraud protection and customer due-diligence laws.  CoinHako, a Singapore-based cryptocurrency provider announced the closure of its DBS Bank account in a blog post.  While it did not state a reason for the bank's decision, it said: ""Regulations and the exact role of the blockchain in society continues to present as a grey area to everyone.""  The exchange told customers it will not be able to process Singapore dollar deposits and withdrawals until a new bank account can be opened – a process it expects to take several weeks.  The account closures come soon after the MAS issued a release stating that digital tokens, distinguished from cryptocurrencies, may be classified as securities. The release was followed by another statement which warned customers about the risks of investing in initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The central bank has, however, shown enthusiasm for digital currency technology in other areas, completing a distributed ledger trial focused on inter-bank payments back in March.

42427828,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL40Rh,1506427209,Like It or Not: Public Companies Are Feeling the Crypto Mining Boom,"While cryptocurrencies may be back in the headlines, most public companies are today keeping any interest in the technology on the periphery of their business.  For tech giants Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), however, that is no longer an option.  So far in 2017, cryptocurrency miners have taken over the market for consumer graphics processing units (GPUs), using the devices to solve the cryptographic puzzles required by ethereum (and other ""scrypt""-based cryptocurrency protocols) and claim their lucrative rewards.  Both companies posted eye-popping sales figures over the first half of this year, as miners exhausted online and in-store inventories. In response, Nvidia and AMD grew second quarter revenues year-over-year by 56 percent and 19 percent, respectively.  Apart from just a boost to the two firms' bottom lines, though, this marks one of the first times cryptocurrencies have had a significant impact on the business of publicly traded companies – and the results seem positive. That said, the tempered reactions of both companies to the growth demonstrate something more could be festering under the surface.  Ambrish Srivastava, an equities analyst at BMO Capital Markets who covers both companies, told CoinDesk:  ""I don't think these companies are happy. The volatility is tough to manage from a business perspective. Crypto for these guys is not their main focus.""  Mo' money, mo' problems  For one, the companies are facing criticism from shareholders and the investment community who don’t want to pay for what they see as highly volatile crypto mining revenue.  Should mining demand dry up, it might send share prices tanking – as happened to AMD in 2013 and 2014 after a collapse in the price of cryptocurrencies. For multiple quarters, AMD's sales were adversely affected as miners dumped their equipment at low prices on the secondary market.  ""The good news is that they're selling more GPUs. The bad news is what happens if they stop selling to this particular community. Is that going to depress their sales and subsequently depress their share price?"" said Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research, a market research group that tracks GPU sales.  The firm's research reveals that AMD lost as much as half its share of the GPU market after the 2013 bust, a good reason for AMD chief executive Lisa Su's focus on mitigating the risk incurred from the mining boom, rather than going all in.  Mitch Steves, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, believes that AMD is fully aware that it is the market-share leader in mining products, and that its bearishness toward mining is a ploy to avoid appearing overexposed.  His estimates suggest that mining accounted for between 18 and 20 percent of the AMD's $1.22 billion in total revenue for the second quarter.  ""AMD is [by far the] better card to mine cryptocurrencies [with]. You'd rather pay [two times] the price for a Radeon 580 before you'd even touch an Nvidia card,"" he told CoinDesk, adding that AMD will have a tough time enticing the investment community with that lead role in the mining market.  Tracking the trade  The key reason shareholders are unsettled by cryptocurrency mining is that companies aren't able to quantify an exact amount of crypto-attributable revenue, which could then be factored into their valuations.  Steves said:  ""They've got to find a way to track it better. If they could just say that 'This is definitely all crypto,' then the investment community wouldn't view it as a nuisance anymore.""  One of the ways Nvidia and AMD are looking to do just that is by splitting the GPU market through the introduction of so-called ""headless"" boards, specifically tailored for mining customers.  Because these graphics cards come with no video display output, gamers won't want them, so there's no risk of miners flooding the secondhand market in the event of another downturn.  ""Some of our [manufacturing] partners are … offering mining specific cards that have a different feature set, such that we're really segmenting the market between gaming and mining,"" said AMD's Su.  Steves believes people are being overly pessimistic about the cryptocurrency boom, though, saying that AMD and Nvidia ""made hundreds of millions of extra money that they probably wouldn't have made.""  ""I don't think there’s ever going to be a point where they're going to turn down money,"" he continued.  Miners vs. gamers  Yet, the revenue opportunity has come with substantial headaches for GPU manufacturers as it relates to their core customer base.  With miners exhausting the supply of new GPUs within minutes and driving up prices on the secondhand market, managing inventory so as to not alienate core video gamer customers has proven a challenge. Video gamers who have been prevented from getting their hands on the latest GPUs, or priced out of the market altogether, have been less than thrilled by the affects of the mining boom.  ""Those traditional base customers of the GPU companies are growling and grumbling because either they can't get the board they expected to get, or they can get it but the resellers are jacking up the price because the demand is so high,"" said Peddie.  Because the GPU companies must typically submit orders for new unit production at least 90 days in advance, they must be able to accurately gauge what the demand for crypto mining will look like in three month's time – and that's an extremely tricky proposition.  Guess too high and you have a massive oversupply filling up the warehouses; guess too low and you run out of product and infuriate your core customers.  And finding that number is still largely a shot in the dark.  Peddie concluded:  ""They're saying 'Let's order 5 million more and hope that we got it right.' If they don't, they deny the base customers' product, then the base customers are just going to walk away. And then, when this bubble stops, they're left with no customers.""

15990220,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/chinas-cryptocurrency-ban-sign-things-come,1506427035,Is China’s Cryptocurrency Ban A Sign Of Things To Come?,"The Chinese government have taken the somewhat controversial decision, and ordered several Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency exchanges to close. The ban seems to have taken the industry by great surprise, given that China has the world’s largest cryptocurrency market – around 80% of Bitcoin transactions take place in yuan. The worrying thing is what effect this ban will have on cryptocurrencies as a whole. Is the ban in China, just a sign of things to come, and will other countries follow suit? We take a look into the reasons behind the ban, and the short and long-term effects of this. Why have China banned cryptocurrency? Initially, China placed a ban on all initial coin offerings (ICO’s) after they came under great scrutiny from officials to prevent fraud and illegal fundraising. Because an ICO is basically an unregulated way to raise funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. This is because you can essentially bypass rigorous and regulated processes that you would normally have to go through. During each campaign, a percentage of the new currency is sold to backers in exchange for money, or another cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency firm must create a whiteplan explaining how much money is required, and what it will fulfil upon completion. During the campaign, these crypto coins can be purchased (known as tokens), and if the ICO is successful, these funds will then be used to launch the new currency. The problem lies when the campaign fails though. The funds are meant to be returned to the backers; however, this is incredibly difficult to regulate, and why China eventually banned them completely. What effect will this have on cryptocurrencies? The truth is that China’s recent ban on ICO’s might not have been as unexpected as first thought. It also doesn’t mean that regulators are completely shutting the door on all cryptocurrencies. The recent ban is likely to hurt local developers the most, as they will now have to look elsewhere to fund their digital projects. What came as more of a shock is when China announced that it would be suspending all operations in cryptocurrency exchanges by the end of the month. As we have already said, China has the world’s largest cryptocurrency market, so this ban will inevitably have an effect on other cryptocurrencies. Already, the ban has seen Bitcoin suffer, as the currency plummeted in value not long after the ban was announced. The value of the currency dropped by $500, after the ban was first announced, and it is unknown if it will fall further, as more closures take place. News initially sent the prices of Bitcoin plunging, and everyone is asking whether this will have a lasting impact on cryptocurrencies or whether this was an initial plunge that will soon pick up again. The good news is that, although it is still early days, evidence would suggest that it is in fact the latter that is happening. Bitcoin, in particular, has surged more than 390% since the start of 2017, so this 10% price drop that was seen after the ban did not damage the overall price of Bitcoin. In fact, within just two days of the announcement, the prices had started rising again. Will other countries follow suit? Everyone is now wondering if China’s ban will see other countries following, fearing that this will have a major detrimental effect on cryptocurrency as a whole. We must remember that Bitcoin is already banned in several countries, and China has just added to this list, rather than starting it. Bangladesh, Iceland, Thailand and Sweden, are among the countries, where Bitcoin, if not all cryptocurrencies are banned. What made China all the more shocking was the fact that they had the world’s largest cryptocurrency market. The point is though, that China simply adds to the already growing list. This suggest that countries have long been banning cryptocurrencies, and less that it is an immediate sign of things to come. As long as demand for the currencies stays high, there is no reason that the price should falter dramatically.

Announced yesterday  , Commerzbank, KfW Banking and MEAG all took part in the effort, designed to test an extension of R3's Corda platform. According to the companies involved, the trial served to show how a money market instrument, traded using distributed ledger technology (DLT), could take place with fewer intermediaries and in a shorter timeframe.  Built using an add-on to R3's Corda platform – which was first unveiled last year – the technology is said to have made the trade transparent through real-time visualization. The combined effects, the release states, provided an example of the efficiency gains that securities market participants could gain from the use of DLT.  ""A same day value date can reduce settlement risk, thus providing relief in terms of capital. As money-market instruments are usually traded in high volumes, a marked reduction in capital and liquidity costs can be expected,"" the firms said.  In statements, participants sought to stress the value of the ""real-time"" nature of the transaction, while providing insight into how DLT might change business operations.  ""This project has allowed us to analyse from an investor's perspective the impact of blockchain technology on front and back-office processes, and regulatory aspects,"" said Frank Wellhöfer, a managing director at MEAG.  Going forward, the banks involved indicated they would seek to test the ""market readiness"" of the platform, with possible next steps including the development of reporting interfaces that would enable information to be shared with regulators.  As such, the trial is the latest that finds major banks testing R3's software. As reported by CoinDesk, the first ""production version"" of the platform is expected later in 2017.

Making his statements to the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Draghi said that ""it would actually not be in our powers to prohibit and regulate"" bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The comments came in response to a question from the committee over whether ECB intends to issue a regulatory framework or an all-out ban on cryptocurrencies, and whether Draghi felt that higher capital requirements for fintech were required to protect the banking sector.  Draghi revealed that the ECB has yet to discuss the potential impact of cryptocurrencies, but likely areas of analysis include the risk posed by cryptocurrency due to its scale, usage and economic impact.  ""We have to ask what effects cryptocurrencies have on the economy,"" Draghi stated, adding that they are still too immature to be considered a viable method of payment.  The primary concern for the ECB surrounding cryptocurrencies, and digital innovation more generally, is cybersecurity, he went on, stressing that protecting against cyber risks is central to the ECB's agenda.  Earlier this month, Draghi also criticised the proposed initiative by Estonia's e-Residency project to launch a national cryptocurrency called ""estcoin,"" reportedly stating:  ""I will comment on the Estonian decision: no member state can introduce its own currency. The currency of the Eurozone is the euro.""  Draghi is not the only senior ECB official to comment on cryptocurrencies in recent days.  The central bank's vice president, Vitor Constancio, made headlines last week when he stated that cryptocurrencies were a purely speculative asset, and compared them to ""tulip mania"" – the 17th century trading bubble experienced in the Netherlands. Constancio stated that the ECB doesn't see the technology as a ""threat to central bank policy.""

According to a report by the Times of Malta, sources said the concept being explored is the introduction of a cryptocurrency within a ""controlled framework,"" which would enable regulators to test possible controls and legislation for the technology.  The Times described the work as a ""sandbox test,"" one advised by a third-party report compiled by auditing giant PwC, itself part of a push to boost the country's credentials in the blockchain technology sector. Such testing would follow the creation of a national strategy, launched in April, which has been publicly supported by the nation's prime minister.  A spokesperson from the government reportedly declined to discuss the specifics of the trial with the news source. However, if true, it could play an important role in informing Malta's evolving domestic policy on blockchain technologies.  While novel for Maltese regulators, the test would be one of many conducted by governments internationally that have often sought to go to extremes to model the economic impact of blockchain technologies.  In 2016, for example, the central bank of the Netherlands went so far as to attempt to extrapolate from bitcoin's early stages what the network would look like in 2140. Further, the potential effects of cryptocurrencies on economies around the globe has been explored in the past, with varying conclusions.

Dunamu, for its part, brings extensive experience in mobile apps to the partnership.

42427814,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL401h,1506416409,'Big Four' Chinese Bank to Launch Blockchain Bancassurance Product,"One of China's ""Big Four"" banks is close to launching a blockchain application aimed at the insurance and banking sectors.  Announced last week, China Construction Bank (CCB) now intends to begin using a custom blockchain platform for bancassurance as soon as Q3, moving a process by which the bank today sells third-party insurance products to a distributed ledger. To be used by CCB's Asia operations, the effort has been designed to improve customer experience, reduce processing times and boost transparency.  IBM, which has partnered on the technical side of the project, said its Hong Kong team has been working with CCB and its insurers on a solution to meet these needs. As such, the platform is now reportedly under testing by participants.  Built with IBM Blockchain, the product comes amid a wider push by the U.S. tech giant to take the products and services it's been incubating with the technology live.  For example, while IBM launched its first commercial blockchain platforms in March, it is still striving to create live networks wherein the technology can be utilized by real businesses. As recently as May, IBM's VP of blockchain technologies spoke on the issue, telling CoinDesk its strategy was then shifting to prioritize more serious customers.  Still, there's evidence to suggest CCB may meet this standard. Given the 2017 launch timeline, the project could be among the first DLT implementations to see wider use.

42427817,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL405h,1506412810,MimbleWimble Won't ICO But Will Launch Cryptocurrency,"It'll take more than the flick of a wand to carry out, but MimbleWimble developers now seem set on creating a new cryptocurrency.  The blockchain project, named after a spell from the Harry Potter book series, has been looking for ways to attach itself to bitcoin since 2016, but with its platform getting closer to being ready (and options like sidechains still in development), developers now argue launching a new cryptocurrency is simply the easiest way to test MimbleWimble with real users.  But while the project touts itself as a more scalable, more private blockchain, launching new cryptocurrencies has historically been seen as controversial.  With hundreds (if not, thousands) of so called altcoins launching and fading into obscurity over the years, some have gone so far as to label the practice an elaborate fraud. But, according to one MimbleWimble developer, the project doesn't intend to follow models that have proven problematic or harmful to investors.  Igno Peverell, the project's pseudonymous lead developer, said:  ""No ICO, pre-mine or funny business.""  Instead, Peverell said money for project development will likely depend on voluntary donations, though the team has not ironed out the details just yet.  Sidechain or new chain?  Stepping back, MimbleWimble's open-source team has continued to grow larger and become more active with time, and because of that, the project has made significant steps forward. Still, the original goal of launching it as a sidechain of the bitcoin network has remained a challenge.  Since MimbleWimble requires bitcoin's existing scripting system to be stripped out, the project has long been considered all but impossible to incorporate into bitcoin itself.  Indeed, Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, one of the earliest advocates for MimbleWimble, and arguably its most visible proponent, agreed that launching a new cryptocurrency is the ""simplest"" option.  ""It's a very reasonable attitude and I'm glad that they're pushing the research and design of MimbleWimble forward,"" he added.  Yet, Poelstra mentioned it might be possible to peg the network's cryptocurrency, called grin, to bitcoin later on, using a mechanism he's currently developing.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Although grin is starting from a different place than I would have preferred, it's still moving in the right direction: toward improved privacy and scalability for bitcoin.""  Competing currencies?  But as for how those features are developing, things are still taking shape.  Because it isn't able to use bitcoin's scripts, it seemed at first as though MimbleWimble wouldn't be able to support more complex transaction types like Schnorr signatures and Lightning Network, both of which could boost capacity even further.  So, if grin has better privacy and scalability, and might be able to support many of the same features bitcoin has, does bitcoin still have any advantages?  To this question, Peverell responded with sarcasm, acknowledging that bitcoin still has the ""largest market,"" ""most known brand"" and ""most active ecosystem,"" making the prospect of competing difficult.  Further, Peverell noted that since bitcoin was upgraded to support Segregated Witness in August, it now allows more advanced transaction types, something that's likely to keep developers busy with new innovations.  All in all, the developer doesn't see it so much as a competition. Instead, Peverell argues that there are tradeoffs between the different approaches.  ""We're not here to 'kill bitcoin.' We're here to provide a radically different, private and scalable alternative that plays well with it,"" he said.  Next steps on a testnet  Developers have been working on a code version of MimbleWimble, also called grin, since October of last year. And that implementation has seen plenty of progress, especially with a new cast of Harry Potter-themed developers (including Antioch Peverell, Luna Lovegood, Seamus Finnigan, and Percy Weasley) joining ranks.  But there's still a lot of work to be done before the team can launch the grin cryptocurrency, Peverell continued, including multiple rounds of testing. First, the current code still needs to be fleshed out, reviewed and tested.  ""We now have a blockchain implementation that, while still naturally immature at this point, doesn't have gaping holes anymore,"" Peverell said.  Second, by testing and bulletproofing the code, they will crystallize an ""alpha"" release, with which they will launch a testnet, a big step toward showing the cryptocurrency community the underlying ideas really work.  Setting up the testnet means producing a first block, known as a ""genesis block"" (in bitcoin, this block was hardcoded by the technology's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto). After that, volunteer testers will be able mine the network and make test transactions.  ""I'm hoping we'll be ready before winter,"" Peverell said.

42427811,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3zxh,1506391508,New SEC Cyber Unit to Police ICOs and Other DLT 'Violations',"The SEC will target violations involving distributed ledger technology and initial coin offerings (ICOs) as part of a new effort to fight cybercrime.  Announced late Monday, the unit will go after ""misconduct perpetrated using the dark web,"" where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are used to pay for illicit goods, the SEC said. The team, led by Robert A. Cohen, a former co-chief of the regulator’s market abuse unit, will also focus on two forms of crime that are often associated with, though hardly unique to, the crypto space: market manipulation and the theft of sensitive information.  The news comes less than a week after the SEC disclosed that its own database of corporate filings had been hacked. However, the agency said Monday that the new cyber unit ""has been in the planning stages for months.""  Perhaps supporting that claim, the announcement was issued exactly two months after the SEC’s shot across the bow of the ICO market – a July 25 investor bulletin that said U.S. securities law may apply to digital token sales.  Still, that bulletin has done little to cool the white-hot market for token sales. More than $600 million in ICOs have been completed since, according to CoinDesk's ICO Tracker.  Separate from the cyber unit, the SEC said Monday, it has also created a retail strategy task force that will ""develop proactive, targeted initiatives to identify misconduct impacting retail investors."" While this task force’s mission was not described as being specifically aimed at the crypto space, the SEC said this new team will ""apply the lessons learned from [past securities fraud] cases and leverage data analytics and technology to identify large-scale misconduct affecting retail investors.""  Those words may come as welcome news to ICO skeptics who claim that many of these sales have preyed on unsophisticated consumers.
