The ""all-you-can-fly"" private airline will allow users to pay for their seats with either cryptocurrency through a mobile app. It serves several cities in California, Texas, and Europe, according to a press release.  The company allows members to pay a monthly fee in order to fly as many times as they want, according to the Independent. Passengers are also pre-screened through a government-approved background check. As a result, they do not have to wait in security.  The cryptocurrency acceptance is being conducted in partnership with Coinbase, which will handle the payments side. In statements, CEO Sudhin Shahani said that the move to accept bitcoin and ethereum forms part of their wider efforts to disrupt air services.  ""Digital currency has been on our radar from the very beginning and we are excited to provide our members with another quick and seamless way to do business with Surf Air,"" he said.  Airlines – particularly smaller, regional ones – are no strangers to the cryptocurrency world, with a number having begun accepting bitcoin over the years. Indeed, the airline industry has also moved to explore applications of blockchain, including in areas such as ticket disbursement and maintenance tracking.

42428201,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6azh,1512511223,"Teams and Products Aren't the Only Way to Weigh Tokens, Says Ehrsam","Don't launch a token no one wants today.  While that may seem obvious, it's the distilled version of the advice Coinbase co-founder and board director Fred Ehrsam gave during his fireside chat at Token Summit II, a conference taking place today in San Francisco.  According to Ehrsam, demand in the crypto space is driven by people who are actually using the technology – largely entrepreneurs and developers working at crypto startups and early investors interested in building the basic architecture of the decentralized economy.  Demand isn't coming from consumers interested in the prospective benefits of a blockchain-based Uber or Airbnb, he continued.  And in turn, Ehrsam – who since leaving Coinbase has continued to invest in and advise crypto projects – said that evaluating new tokens is about ""matching the token and the project to the maturity of the ecosystem.""  Sure, the quality of the team and the progress they have made on building on their product are also good indicators of successful projects, but still, there are projects the world isn't ready for yet.  Turning back to valuable projects for the ecosystem today, Ehrsam, specifically pointing to TrueBit and Basecoin, said:  ""It seems clear to me that developers in this space would want a scalability solution or a stable coin.""  For example, blockchain developers, including those for the two most widely used networks – bitcoin and ethereum – have been under pressure recently for the technology's inability to scale for new adoption. Bitcoin's scaling debates created enough contention this year that several groups split off the main chain, creating competing cryptocurrencies.  Formula for success?  Otherwise, Ehrsam said he relies on an equation he learned as a currency trader to guide some of his investments – MV = PQ (money supply multiplied by the velocity of money is equal to the price of goods multiplied by the number of goods sold).  The velocity of money simply means how many times a given unit of money changes hands. So, if a lot of people are using a given product, then it should have a fairly high velocity, which starts to show the value of the overall protocol.  ""Through this equation, I think you can start backing into how much a token is actually worth,"" Ehrsam said.  However, he acknowledged (and moderator and Token Summit organizer William Mougayar agreed), this model requires more research.  Velocity, Ehrsam continued, is the most sensitive measurement in the crypto industry, since it depends on getting tokens into the hands of people likely to use them.  Because of that, many in the crypto community respond well to the ""perception of fairness"" in the economics of a token, whereby tokens favor potential users over speculators.  Citing the popularity of bitcoin betting site Satoshi Dice and the ethereum-clogging CryptoKitties, Ehrsam said the most valuable products today are sometimes the simplest decentralized apps (Dapps). He concluded:  ""I think it's really critical that people get the game theory around their end goal absolutely right.""

42428202,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6b1h,1512506757,A Missouri Lawmaker Wants to Ban Blockchain Gun Tracking,"A Missouri lawmaker wants to prevent blockchain from being used to track firearms – in most cases, that is.  State Representative Nicholas Schroer (R-107), public records show, is introducing a bill that would make it illegal to use a distributed ledger and other types of decentralized databases to hold firearm owner information.  The draft measure states:  ""It shall be unlawful to require a person to use or be subject to electronic firearm tracking technology or to disclose any identifiable information about the person or the person's firearm for the purpose of using electronic firearm tracking technology.""  The act provides for some exceptions, however. Those carve-outs cover law enforcement officials, sellers who use a distributed ledger or similar technology to report sales to the state, and firearm owners who have provided written consent to have their weapons tracked on a ledger.  Schroer's bill was also careful to differentiate between electronic firearm tracking technologies, which refer to distributed ledgers or other decentralized databases, and official law enforcement tracking systems like the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES) database.  If passed, the bill states that anyone who illegally tracks firearms on a blockchain could be found guilty of a Class E felony. Class E felonies are the least severe of Missouri felonies and can be punishable by up to four years in jail, according to law firm Carver Cantin Mynarich, LLC.  Notably, the Missouri bill nearly identical to one signed into law in Arizona in February, which also makes it illegal to track firearms on a blockchain unless the user is in an exempted category (that measure, too, includes carve-outs for law enforcement and the like). That bill was signed less than a month after it was first introduced in mid-January.

That's according to Brian Hoffman, CEO of OB1, the development company behind the decentralized e-commerce protocol OpenBazaar, who announced today the project will seek to incorporate a token into its existing product offering sometime in 2018.  Announced at Token Summit II in San Francisco, the news was revealed onstage by Hoffman, who indicated that it represents a response to ongoing congestion on the bitcoin network that he said has made it less useful for payments.  Still in its early stages, the white paper for the OpenBazaar Token (OBT) will be released in Q12018, with the goal of soliciting feedback from the community before any sale, Hoffman said.  However, Hoffman continued, that feedback process has already begun.  For example, he reported the idea has been floated around to industry insiders to get a sense of the reaction. One of the more notable and beloved projects built on the bitcoin protocol, Hoffman suggested he expects the response to the move will be critical.  ""I’ve already floated it to people who will give me shit, so I have a sense of what we’re going to get,"" Hoffman said.  As such, his comments echo other bitcoin entrepreneurs who have embraced a business model that includes the use of alternative protocols with publicly traded tokens. Earlier this year, startups Storj and Tierion, for example, made similar moves to varying degrees of backlash.  Still, Hoffman cautioned that this move can't quite be equated with those decisions, as OpenBazaar will still use bitcoin as its main protocol. Rather, OBT will be used to reward the users of a forthcoming ""channels"" feature, in which fixed addresses for commerce would be auctioned off in a real-time bidding process.  As revealed in May, the channels feature was planned for the project's Milestone 2 update, but was pushed back in development.  Hoffman explained that channels would be a way for solving OB's discoverability problem.  The new feature is ""basically a way for anybody on the network to make a curated list of content."" Hofman said, adding:  ""You will be able to monetize that value to the network through the token""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in OB1 and Tierion.

The token sale for SophiaTX, originally planned to start on Dec. 5, has been pushed back to ensure an orderly sale, the team behind the project announced today. SophiaTX, which is developing a blockchain platform for business-to-business use cases, said it will hold its ICO on Thursday, Dec. 7.  The problem, the team said, is that the activity around CryptoKitties – an ethereum-based app that uses tokens to represent digital cats that can be traded, exchanged or bred to create more e-pets – has effectively clogged up the blockchain.

42428177,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6X5h,1512493212,'More Bang for Less Byte': ICOs Confront Growing Pains,"If the opening reception at Token Summit II was any indication, the initial coin offering (ICO) market is still brimming with enthusiasm – but struggling to figure itself out.  CoinDesk arrived last night only a few minutes after the start time, but the room was already full of people eager to share their ideas about potential applications for decentralized platforms, as well as the various approaches they have so far taken for fundraising.  Indeed, it seems the event has succeeded in growing audience since it last convened for an inaugural summit in May, with suits and hoodies both bumping shoulders.  Laurent Féral-Pierssens, of KPMG Canada's emerging technology group, explained the appeal:  ""I think the whole equity-to-liquidity roadmap is being redesigned as we speak, and it’s all happening over the next 24 months.""  Yet, exactly how it will be redesigned remains an open question, with several key issues yet to be resolved: How should investors evaluate token offerings? Can blockchains scale to accommodate all the proposed use cases? And to what degree will Web 2.0 companies get involved?  These questions will be explored today as the conference, hosted by angel investor William Mougayar, kicks off in earnest.  Token metrics  In a sector with a lot of potential and hardly any products in the market, investors are grappling with how to differentiate good opportunities from the duds. The default answer on validation seems to be ""the team,"" but what does that really mean?  In the immediate term, Kenetic Capital's Jehan Chu gave a specific answer, telling CoinDesk:  ""The number of devs you have on your project is highly underrated and a metric that is not asked enough.""  Scalar Capital's Jordan Clifford (a Coinbase alum) got even more specific, pointing to the scaling challenges facing the network. He's looking for companies whose business plans have factored in the reality that blockchains aren't ready for high volume usage.  ""They need to have clever strategies for how they are going to scale and get more bang for less byte,"" Clifford said.  He described the blockchain as a commons, and said he's looking for developers with the skill to ""push as much of the problem off the main chain.""  Can they scale?  Which raises the most fundamental question for the industry: can this technology handle all the work entrepreneurs envision for it?  While the ICO industry frets about the possibility of a regulatory crackdown, such interventions are a moot point if distributed technology can't be fast, reliable and deliver a great user experience.  Because of this, multiple projects are ongoing to find ways to scale blockchain to allow for an ever-growing number of transactions without substantially increasing the cost to facilitate those transactions.  Sardor Umarov is the co-founder of what he hopes will be an important blockchain-based hotel management app, BookLocal. His family also runs the Exchange Suites in Memphis, where they will be testing his solution. By the time they're happy with how it works, he said, he is optimistic the networks will be ready.  ""Let's just assume two years, the latest prediction,"" Umarov said. ""There's just so many scaling options.""  Another entrepreneur and former VC in the energy sector, Jeremy Adelman, agreed. A co-founder of Bluenote, one of the companies presenting today, he said he’s not nervous about the infrastructure's readiness to decentralize the global energy markets.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Human ingenuity will find a way to unlock the most value.""  He could be right, but it looks tough currently, sinceprogrammatically bred cartoon cats are clogging up the ethereum network this week.  Wild card  But while blockchain developers work to find solutions to the technology's scaling problems, more and more mainstream companies are being lured into the space.  It will be telling if established internet companies have representatives at Token Summit looking for new ways to ship (in the Silicon Valley sense of “getting products out the door”).  After all, one baby unicorn, the messaging app Kik, has already distributed its own token, which it announced at the first Token Summit.  Mougayar has promised a big announcement – will it be another familiar name entering the space? Stay tuned to CoinDesk for updates.

Bloomberg News said earlier today that Tokyo Financial Exchange has formed a working group as part of an early effort to start listing futures contracts based around the cryptocurrency. As the news service explained, this would constitute a first step toward pushing for a change in Japanese national law that would clear the runway for a bitcoin future.  The disclosure came on Dec. 1 during a press conference held by CEO Shozo Ohta, during which he said that the exchange would seek to move quickly pending regulatory approval.  Ohta said at the time:  ""Once the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act recognizes cryptocurrencies as financial products, we will list the futures as quickly as possible. To achieve that, we will launch this working group to study various aspects, including bitcoin’s present status, its outlook, and what form it will take root in Japan’s society.""  That the exchange would move to even explore the launch of bitcoin futures is perhaps unsurprising, given the efforts of firms like CME Group and CBOE to create such products in the U.S. As previously reported, trading of CBOE's future is expected to begin late Sunday, with CME commencing with their own roughly a week later.

The individual, Sal Mansy, was arrested in June 2015 for funneling bitcoin transactions through a corporation he owned called TV TOYZ. Mansy conducted $2.4 million-worth of bitcoin transactions over a two-year period, according to a release from the U.S. Attorneys office in Maine.  Mansy pleaded guilty in May to purchasing bitcoin through the Coinbase and Bitstamp exchanges, and selling the cryptocurrency at a profit through LocalBitcoins, as CoinDesk previously reported.  According to the release:  “It is against federal law for a money-service business to exchange or transfer bitcoin without registering. Mansy was aware that he was required to register with FinCEN.”  Following his jail time for the offence, Mansy will receive three years of supervised release. He must further forfeit $118,000 in cash and bitcoin gained through the illegal scheme. Investigators confiscated roughly that amount during his arrest in 2015.  Undercover investigators conducted two trades with Mansy for amounts totaling 6.32 BTC – an amount valued at $1,900 at the time and now worth nearly $75,000, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The case is just one of a number arrests in recent years for running illegal businesses using bitcoin.  In October, another Michigan resident, Bradley Stetkiw, was charged with running an unlicensed money transmitting business after selling some $150,000 in bitcoin.  Stetkiw also used LocalBitcoins to facilitate his transactions, and federal agents bought $56,000 worth of bitcoin from him at the time.  A third LocalBitcoins user in Missouri, Jason Klein, pleaded guilty to running an unlicensed money transmission business in May, after he sold 98 bitcoins (worth more than $1 million today) to undercover agents in 2015 and 2016.

42428183,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6X7h,1512483608,$240: Monero Prices Hit Record High and Could Climb Further,"Prices of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency monero are at an all-time high and could keep on climbing, chart analysis indicates.  Monero (XMR) moved past previous record highs near $210 earlier today and was trading at the new lifetime high of $240.12 soon before press time. As per CoinMarketCap, XMR has appreciated 19 percent in the last 24 hours.  Activity on social media indicates the investor community has taken note of cybersecurity pioneer and eclectic personality John McAfee's upbeat comments on the cryptocurrency. The noted antivirus inventor and CEO of MGTCapital, while talking to the media, said monero could be a serious competitor for bitcoin.  Indeed, the cryptocurrency looks to be moving more mainstream, with a music industry payments scheme announced today, although, of course, a clear connection between any media announcements and price gains can't be clearly established.  The price rally is largely in line with the significant gains seen in other bitcoin alternatives like bitcoin cash and litecoin.  CoinMarketCap  data shows the rally is being in part fueled by Korean desks. Trading volumes in the XMR/KRW pair offered by Bithumb, one of the largest South Korean exchanges, have gone up by 30 percent over the last 24 hours.  Looking at the price charts, the base has shifted higher today, and the rally could extend to $265–270 levels in the short-term.  Monero chart  The above chart shows:  Monero has taken out resistance at $223 (127.2 percent Fibonacci extension). The next big resistance level is lined up at $266.97 (161.8 percent Fibonacci extension).  The 5-day and 10-day moving averages are sloping upwards in favor of the bulls, indicating a corrective pullback, if any, is likely to run out of steam below the 10-day MA (seen today at $190.09).  The relative strength index (RSI) points to overbought conditions, although still well below the highs seen in late August.  View  Monero looks set to test $265–$270 levels in the short-term.  A technical correction/healthy pullback is a possibility due to overbought conditions, but dips below 10-day MA will likely be short-lived.

Bitcoin Eyes $12k, But Correction Possible","Bitcoin may soon move to fresh all-time highs above $12,000, but signs of trader fatigue are still evident, price chart analysis suggests.  Prices of the cryptocurrency have already neared Sunday's record high of $11,831 this morning, reaching $11,793 at around 08:00 UTC, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). At time of writing, bitcoin has dropped back a little to $11,649.  Looking at CoinMarketCap data, bitcoin (BTC) has gained 4.18 percent in the last 24 hours, and 18% over the last 7 days.  Importantly, the bulls scored a brownie point yesterday by ensuring that bitcoin closed (as per UTC) above last week's highs near $11,500. While prices did hit the new high of $11,831 Sunday, the day's close was below previous record highs – a sign of bull market exhaustion.  Bitcoin chart  A close above last week's high (doji candle/previous record high) indicates a continuation of the rally, indicating that bitcoin may hit fresh record highs above $12,000 in the next 24–48 hours.  Still, the odds of a pullback remain high, with the daily relative strength index (RSI) showing overbought conditions (above 70.00) for the 10th consecutive day.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  Potential double top reversal with neckline level of $10,950.  Of late, volumes have remained low during the rally, while bouts of sell-off have been accompanied by a big jump in volumes (marked by circles). A high volume retreat in prices indicates potential for a correction.  Although bitcoin's price is forming higher lows, the RSI is losing altitude, also indicating scope for a pullback.  Formed at the top of the bull market, a double top is a bearish reversal pattern comprising two consecutive peaks that are roughly equal, with a moderate trough in-between.  A break below the neckline support ($10,950) confirms a bearish reversal. If the 4-hour candle closes below $10,950, prices may fall back to $10,100 (target as per the measured-height method).  View  Bitcoin could set fresh record highs above $12,000, as imminent BTC futures listings from CME and the CBOE are seen as opening doors for institutional investors.  However, chart studies still suggest that a healthy pullback to $10,000 is possible.  However, only an end of the day close below $10,000 (rising trendline support on the 4-hour chart) would indicate a temporary top has been made. In that scenario, prices could then test $8900-8,600 levels.

42428174,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6Wzh,1512464423,Bitcoin Futures: Make Way for a New Kind of Whale,"Lanre Sarumi is the CEO of Level Trading Field, an interactive online platform for professionals in the finance industry.      For bitcoin traders, all eyes should be on Dec. 10 and Dec. 18.  That's when former self-styled bitcoin whales will be swallowed up like plankton as the CBOE and CME Group launch bitcoin futures contracts for the first time in history.  Over the next few days, I will be providing information on trading in the bitcoin futures market. My goal is to shed some light on its peculiarities and hopefully help people avoid mistakes. To start, it won't just be the whales that will be devoured, but any other smaller crustaceans that choose to ignore the potential impact a derivatives market can have on an underlying commodity.  You see, in bitcoin's cash market, where these whales exist, they swim amongst other bitcoin marine lives without necessarily attacking their co-habitants. The reason is simple. Everyone in bitcoin's cash market is financially incentivized to keep the price of bitcoin high.  Sure, the market sometimes takes a dip, but that’s because some bitcoin holders are taking profits off the table. In the futures market, there is as much reward for the creatures on the downside as well as the upside. Tremendous wealth can be created in a falling market as it can be in a rising market. There are incentives on either side.  Essentially, bitcoin's cash market is like a river. Its flow is dependent on constants and so it generally flows in one direction. The bitcoin futures market, on the other hand, is like an ocean with thermohaline circulation: its flow is dependent on several variables.  Marine life in the futures market is not as friendly. The waters are infested with killer whales. Apex predators that feed on other whales. They even feed on themselves.  Alright, enough of the marine analogy...  Changing tides  Journey through any of the bitcoin forums on Slack, Reddit and Telegram, and there is general happiness and optimism about the value of bitcoin with the advent of a futures market.  This is born from a lack of understanding of how futures markets work.  There is this misguided perception that the futures markets work in a similar fashion to the cash market. In fact, both markets are diametrically opposite.  Cash markets (e.g. stock exchanges and bitcoin exchanges) are primarily populated with optimists. Futures markets, on the other hand, are primarily populated with pessimists.  Put another way, cash markets were created for investors, while futures market were created to hedge against risk. Investors go to the cash markets because they believe the value of the assets will rise. Hedgers go to the futures market because they don’t want the price of the asset to move against them. You can't ""sell"" in the cash markets if you don't already own the underlying asset. Even the short sellers borrow those assets from owners before shorting.  The futures market has no such constraint. You can sell whether you own the underlying asset or not. A corn farmer sells futures contract because he is afraid the price may fall and wants to guarantee a price for his corn when he eventually harvests it.  A manufacturer that uses corn buys a futures contract because he is afraid the price of corn will rise and wants to cap the price he pays for corn.  Both buyers and sellers in their own way are pessimistic.  Uncharted waters  In the corn futures market, the farmer and the manufacturer are natural hedgers on opposite sides of the market. Thus, they create some sort of equilibrium.  Of course, market makers and speculators are required to create additional liquidity, but they, for the most part, rely on the existence of the true hedgers.  In the bitcoin futures market, the only groups that need to hedge are the miners and current bitcoin holders. Miners will sell futures contracts to guarantee they get at least the given price for the bitcoins they plan to mine in the future. Bitcoin owners will do the same to hedge their downside.  There are no natural hedgers on the buy side. This will inadvertently create pressure on the downside.  The only group left to keep the price steady and maybe even cause the price to rise is the group of speculators. Unlike the miners and bitcoin holders, the speculators will comprise of both bulls and bears. For the most part, we have seen the power of the bulls in the cash market, but until the introduction of the futures market, we had not seen the power of the bears.  Could the bears overwhelm the bulls? Vice versa? No one knows. Is the introduction of futures going to lead to an increase in bitcoin price? No one knows.  What is clear though is if you currently hold enough bitcoin to be classified a whale, you better familiarize yourself with the futures market. Simply drifting in the ocean hoping for the best is not a strategy. Well, it is a strategy, just not a very good one.

In a patent application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office last Thursday, UBS explains how it might use a distributed ledger to validate transactions by creating a permanent record of every action committed on the chain.  The key advantages a distributed ledger has over traditional technologies is its decentralization and immutability, according to the application.  The document emphasizes:  “Although a number of non-blockchain-based technologies related to account and data security, authentication, and verification exist (e.g., authorization/access to financial or other accounts, verification of buyers of purchase transactions, verification of owners of securities, verification of notaries of documents, etc.), many of these technologies rely on trust of the third party managing the database and/or lack one or more benefits of blockchain technology.”  The application noted the use of smart contracts to automatically register that a record is added to the chain. Once the record is added, the user will automatically receive a notification sent by the same contract.  UBS indicated it could either put the smart contract on the same blockchain that stores the data being added or develop two separate blockchains: one to store the data, and one to hold the smart contract monitoring data additions.  The company has long been interested in blockchain applications, with UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti saying he believes blockchain technology ""play a big role in changing and reshaping our industry"" this past October.  Putting their money where their mouth is, the company had already revealed a trade transaction platform built on a blockchain in partnership with IBM late in 2016. Called Batavia, the project has been expanding with four major banks joining the effort near the beginning of October 2017.

The most expensive dunce cap in the world is a hat I bought with bitcoin about five years ago.  I'm not going to bother looking up exactly how much bitcoin I paid for it, and what that would be worth if I had just HODL'd. It's too mortifying to contemplate.  But you know what's even more embarrassing than my failure then to grasp one of the fundamental advantages of bitcoin? Joseph Stiglitz's failure to grasp it now.  Bitcoin ""doesn’t serve any socially useful function,"" the Nobel Prize-winning economist blithely declared on Bloomberg television last week. Wrong, Joe.  Off the top of my head, I can name three socially useful functions of bitcoin: its censorship-resistance; its judgment-resistance; and the topic of this post, its deflationary characteristics, which reward saving for tomorrow rather than splurging today.  Saver-shaming  Stepping back, a longstanding knock on bitcoin's suitability as a currency was that its fixed, predictable supply and zigzagging but generally increasing value against the dollar encouraged hoarding. But ""hoarding"" in this context seems little more than a morally loaded term for what our grandparents called ""saving.""  Used in this way, the word ""hoarding"" pathologizes thrift, something once considered virtuous. It equates the kind of person who will wait 15 minutes for two marshmallows instead of eating one now with the kind of person who keeps 40 cats in a New York City apartment.  In his forthcoming book ""The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking,"" economist Saifedean Ammous argues that wider adoption of bitcoin would have a salutary influence on people's behavior.  ""When the value of money appreciates, people are likely to be far more discerning with their consumption, and to save far more of their income for the future,"" writes Ammous, who is an assistant professor of economics at Adnan Kassar School of Business at Lebanese American University in Beirut. ""The culture of conspicuous consumption, of shopping as therapy ... will not have a place in a society with a money which appreciates in value over time.""  Sounds great in theory, you might say, but how do we know it will work in practice? Well, it already is – at least anecdotally.  As developer Jimmy Song wrote in a blog post in September:  ""Most bitcoiners I have met regret most purchases they’ve made with bitcoin because unlike fiat, bitcoin increases in utility and value. People that were once living paycheck-to-paycheck now look at investment horizons of 10–20 years.""  Leaving a legacy  That long-term thinking is perhaps most evident in the volunteer army toiling away at bitcoin's code, as suggested by this telling observation from CoinDesk editor-in-chief Pete Rizzo in his July article unpacking the scaling debate:  ""I once asked two high-profile developers if they cared if they even lived to see bitcoin become what they envisioned. They seemed to think that this was unlikely, and didn't seem worse off for the realization.""  Think about that. These devs are so future-oriented that they're OK if the full payoff comes when they're dead.  In this light, it's ironic that Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett are among bitcoin's most prominent doubters, since they co-signed an open letter last year bemoaning Wall Street's obsession with quarterly metrics at the expense of long-term value creation.  If Dimon and Buffett did a little digging, they might see that bitcoin can have the opposite effect on individual behavior.  So, while it's all well and good that the price is up 1,000% this year, getting rich quick is a lame reason to be interested in bitcoin. It's not about Lambos, and it's certainly not about YOLO – quite the opposite.  No price floor  To be sure, continued price increases are far from guaranteed.  As even the most ardent evangelists have said since the early days, bitcoin is not for anyone's life savings. With no buyer of last resort, it still could conceivably tank and never recover.  That said, bitcoin's track record as a store of value since its birth nearly nine years ago is looking pretty good at this juncture. Whether that dooms it as a common currency, as even some sympathetic observers say, remains to be seen.  But given that the U.S. personal savings rate has plummeted from above 10% for most of the 1960s to around 3% today – with near-rock-bottom interest rates punishing those who save the old-fashioned way – I'd say anything that motivates young people to think about tomorrow (to quote a favorite song of Stiglitz's former boss) serves a very socially useful function.
