42397268,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4bO,1380557926,Bitcoin's role in the future of micropayments,"Different payment processors have different opinions on the definition of a microtransaction, commonly known as a miniscule payment for a good or service.  Small businesses in the US like to require that customers make at least a $10 transaction on a credit or debit card. That’s because some processors charge more for smaller transactions in order to make money on every purchase.  PayPal, for example, sets its fees higher when payments are below $12, which it considers a microtransaction. Paypal's normal rate is 2.9% + $0.30, while there is a higher 5% + $0.05 micropayments rate.  Can it really be considered that something below twelve dollars is a microtransaction?  Perhaps that rate is an example of how far there is to go in the payments industry for processing small amounts of money, although it is fair to point out that processors need to generate revenue from each payment made.  Yet something needs to happen, however, because theses activities should at some point require some degree of change to reflect new concepts like digital media.  Publishers, for example, would do well to accept small payments for reading content.  Bloomberg BusinessWeek has to cannibalize its own print business by charging only $2.49 a month for the digital edition of its magazine, available on tablets. That’s because it has to, as most people move from printed content to online consumption.  But what if publishers made a decision to put up microtransaction-based digital currency paywalls for pennies on the dollar to read individual articles?  BitWall  One company that is embracing this idea is BitWall, which just completed the summer 2013 session with six other bitcoin startups at Boost VC, an incubator in San Mateo, California.  BitWall utilizes Coinbase’s payment processing for bitcoin transactions. This is because Coinbase recently announced support for off-block chain transactions since micropayments could eventually drastically enlarge the ledger’s overall size.  Nic Meliones, BitWall’s CEO, believes that Coinbase’s system of off-block chain transactions helps his business.  “Transactions from readers to publishers are off-block chain (i.e. in-network) when they are signed up for BitWall,” via Coinbase, he says.  The idea is that Coinbase aggregates the small payments as a processor and then posts a larger amount on the block chain.  BitWall users are also given the option to view content for free with ads or also get 3 hours of free access for a tweet.  BitMonet  Another bitcoin microtransaction effort comes from BitMonet, which is a free and open project that enables publishers to encourage small amounts of money for pieces of content.  BitMonet has a WordPress plugin that bloggers can link to a bitcoin address, which is a snap to use and doesn't require any HTML modification on a webiste.  BitMonet’s lead developer, Ankur Nandwani, is working on the project solely because of his own interest in bitcoin.  “Microtransactions is a really interesting use-case. And if done properly, it can be the driving force behind bitcoin adoption,” says Nandwani.  BitMonet uses BitPay as the processing platform, which can pose a bit of a problem since unlike Coinbase every BitPay transaction requires a 0.99% transaction fee plus the 0.0005 BTC network fee if a sender wants fast payment.  This gives Coinbase clients some advantage over other processors.  “People talk about off-the-block chain microtransactions to overcome them, but until and unless they are supported by all the clients, it would be hard to carry out microtransactions at a larger scale”, says Nandwani.  Microtransactions and block chain bloat  In fact, there are some solutions being bandied about on how to solve this microtransaction quandary. One of the ways to overcome this could come from an update to the bitcoin client itself.  The process is a bit complicated, but Nandwani best explains it when he says it involves, “sending a bigger amount, and then adjusting it between the sender and receiver, and then ultimately broadcasting the transactions when no more transactions are to be carried out.”  There are other options on the table that have been discussed on Reddit. However, it is clear that the best path forward is probably a change to the bitcoin client and thus the network itself.  Bitcoin is a protocol, and as such there should be a consensus solution available.  Coinbase’s implementation of a no-fee solution for the time being helps to promote this idea, as once senders and receivers are utilizing this in merchant and person-to-person transactions it will hopefully take off in terms of adoption.  Conclusion  Small transactions are a wave of the future, but it is going to ultimately require the cooperation of payment processors in order for it to gain traction.  In places such as Africa, small transactions are already being used for all sorts of things. Kenya’s M-PESA is an example of a mobile phone-based digital currency that allows the mostly unbanked to send via SMS small daily amounts of money for things like utilities.  There are also some ideas to use microtransactions as a system to speed up or otherwise bypass regular everyday processes.  Meliones, the BitWall CEO, noted that there are some in the bitcoin community that believe small transactions could enable drivers to pass people in traffic by offering a small payment as a rewards.  Other incentive-based ideas also include gamification, a concept that offers small rewards for solving puzzles or performing small amounts of work in order to earn a small fee for doing so.  What will be interesting is what developers come up with in this regard, once the friction of payments is lessened overall.  What do you think about microtransactions?  What is something that you would be willing to pay a small fee for if it was easy to and worth it to you?  How do you think it affects what bitcoin miners provide to the network as a whole?

42397262,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4VU,1380549754,How to get started with litecoin,"If you're new to the cryptocurrency world, you'd be forgiven for not having heard of litecoin. The currency, which was created by Charles Lee in 2011, is the second largest digital currency next to bitcoin. Here is our guide to what you need to know.  Knowing your litecoin from your bitcoin  If you are used to using bitcoin, litecoin holds few surprises – if you're not yet initiated, read our guides on What is bitcoin and Why use bitcoin. The ideas in those guides also apply to litecoin.  The primary desktop application is a modification of Bitcoin-QT client, and can be downloaded from litecoin's website. This can also act as a wallet. Other litecoin wallets are available on We Use Litecoin.  There are important differences though. For starters, while bitcoin has a cap of 21 million coins, litecoin will be four times larger at 84 million.  Just like bitcoin, litecoin has started with a mining reward of 50 coins per block. However, the litecoin reward will halve every 840,000 blocks. Again this is four times larger than the 210,000 block threshold in bitcoin.  The transaction fee for litecoin is 0.02 LTC, which is proportionately higher than the minimum bitcoin fee of 0.0001 BTC, however, keep in mind that a litecoin is currently worth 0.019 BTC.  The factor of four difference between litecoin and bitcoin persists into the block time too. The block time is the time it is supposed to take miners to confirm a block on the block chain.  For bitcoin this is 10 minutes, but for litecoin it is just 2.5 minutes. This means that litecoin has the potential to be more attractive to merchants as there will be less time to wait to ensure that a payment has been received from customers.  Litecoin intelligence  In terms of the web ecosystem around litecoin, you'll find a block chain explorer here, however it's in beta and far from the sophistication of blockchain.info for bitcoin.  You should also check out http://explorer.litecoin.net/.  Litecoin also has a charts website (like Bitcoincharts) at http://www.ltc-charts.com, where litecoin's performance against BTC and USD is compared on several exchanges. Data spans up to one year ago from the current date.  If you want to get involved in the litecoin community, you'll want to join the forum (you'll also find limited litecoin discussion on the bitcoin forum) and/or subscribe to the litecoin subreddit. Also, Litecoin Rates provides a quick lookup services for exchange rates between litecoin, bitcoin and various fiat currencies.  Buying and trading  The next most important aspect to address is where on earth to obtain litecoin?  Unless you're a miner (more on that later), you'll need to buy from one of several exchanges, Litecoin's forum – or in person, alá LocalBitcoins style.  The places we know of that you can buy litecoin from are as follows:BitBargain UK, bittylicious, Bitfinex, BTC-e, BTER, Kraken, Cryptsy, Vircurex, and last but not least, the latest entrant into the crypto-exchange world CoinMKT.  Litecoin so far has nowhere near the acceptance of bitcoin, and as such there are far fewer merchants accepting the currency.  However, you can find a few useful links over at We Use Litecoins.  For example, there's Jobs for Litecoins which is a subreddit for litecoin-accepting freelancers.  Litecoin mining  An important aspect that separates litecoin from bitcoin is that it uses a totally different 'proof of work' algorithm than bitcoin does.  Bitcoin uses the SHA256 hashing algorithm, while litecoin uses the scrypt algorithm. While SHA256 favours systems with the largest raw processing power, scrypt's algorithm, according to Wikipedia, was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory.  In other words, the system favours systems with large amounts of RAM (which is relatively expensive), and is a form of a ""Memory Hard Problem"". Otherwise, transactions work just as they do in bitcoin.  What this means for prospective miners is that super expensive bitcoin FPGA and ASIC hardware is of no advantage in scrypt mining.  The good news is that computers with powerful graphics cards (i.e. GPUs) that were once used for bitcoin mining but have been made obsolete can be repurposed for litecoin mining. The process of mining litecoin is, otherwise, the same as bitcoin mining.  Just as with other crypto-mining, there are mining pools to make the process somewhat more rewarding for participants, and you can find a comprehensive list of litecoin pools over at We Use Litecoins.  If you intend to either join a pool or solo mine, the software of choice is cgminer. However, be careful as this Australian blogger described: the combination of electricity costs, litecoin difficulty and USD price could mean that mining isn't profitable for you – so do your homework on your local utility prices!  There's a good guide into the details of setting up a litecoin miner over at cryptocur.com.  Closing thoughts  So now you know more about litecoin, however there is still the case to make of why you should use it.  Well, it's not going to be for everyone, just like cryptocurrency in general isn't for everyone.  It's certainly true though that – just as for bitcoin – it faces a chicken and egg problem. It isn't going to be adopted if it isn't used, and it's less likely to be used if it isn't adopted more.  However, just as was pointed out in our interview with founder Charles Lee, ""One possibility is that bitcoin will be used for more expensive purchases, whereas litecoin will take up the microtransaction space"", Lee suggests (which also explains his focus on variable transaction fees).  The low fees and fast transaction time make a compelling case for litecoin adoption in small businesses that need to leverage every advantage they can find to make them more appealing than larger, less agile, companies.  Keep up with the latest news on litecoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | LTC | MINING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/30/how-to-get-started-with-litecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db25a47dce912621fd4d166ac1172a6ad8ae0611-1000x563.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397260,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4TW,1380539271,Shining a dim light on Dark Wallet,"What is behind Dark Wallet, the new plug-in browser-based bitcoin wallet designed for non-technical users, and described in the New Yorker last week? The wallet is under development by Cody Wilson, who has gained notoriety as a distributor of information that can challenge traditional notions of free speech.      Wilson did not respond to requests for an interview, and little is known about Dark Wallet at present, other than what is reported in the New Yorker. The system will be designed as a wallet for mainstream users, used as a plug-in for Chrome and Firefox browsers, on Windows, Mac, and Linux machines.      The New Yorker reports that in Dark Wallet some of the computational overhead in many bitcoin clients that avoids double spending would be moved to separate servers. It implies that the wallet could be an SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) implementation. This seems likely, given the difficulty of downloading a 10GB copy of the block chain (doubtless much bigger, by the time Dark Wallet is released) using a browser plug-in designed for mainstream users who are unlikely to stand for any delays beyond a few minutes.      Wilson has a history when it comes to bringing controversial new ideas into the mainstream. He is responsible for Defense Distributed, a non-profit organization based in Texas, which aims to defend the right to bear arms in the US by distributing information about 3-D printing and guns. The organization published the 3-D printed plans for the Liberator single-shot pistol before being forced to take them down by the US State Department Office of Defence, which argued that they may violate export control laws. They have since been hosted on file sharing sites such as The Pirate Bay.      Defense Distributed also launched DefCad Search, a search engine designed specifically for 3-D printable CAD models. Searching for Liberator on this site brings up not only ordered components for the original Liberator pistol, but also new versions of the entire weapon.      Self-described crypto-anarchist Wilson is working with Amir Taaki, a British software developer affiliated with unSystem, a group building tools to subvert incumbent power structures and systems. unSystem also lists Defense Distributed as one of its projects, and Austin (Wilson’s home city) as one of its locations, suggesting that Wilson is tightly bound with the group.      Wilson and his colleagues are clearly following a particular political ethos, attempting to wrest control of the economic system from the established powers. But putting that aside for a second, we find the concept of a browser plug-in wallet intriguing.      It isn't yet clear how Dark Wallet will differ from other browser-based wallet plug-ins such as Blockchain.info's My Wallet, but presumably, the emphasis will be on making it as easy to use as possible for non-technical users.      Some of the components for an easy-to-use bitcoin system are already here, and some are coming. For example, a “bitcoin"" handler has already been introduced into HTML 5, whitelisted by standards developers who have enabled a hyperlink to be encoded to start a bitcoin payment.      We have also seen plans for a new bitcoin payment messaging system, hopefully to be introduced in version 0.9 of the bitcoin protocol. This would enable payments to be requested by merchants, and to be handled using digital certificates, rather than cumbersome QR codes and incomprehensible bitcoin addresses.      And work is also in progress to create a Web Payments standard at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This work would see a currency-agnostic standard which would therefore support bitcoin, and which would hopefully support one-click payments. Manu Sporny, one of the driving forces behind this W3C Web Payments group, runs an online payment company called PaySwarm. He would like to see a browser plug-in enabled that would spawn a PaySwarm payment.      One problem that Dark Wallet would need to solve would be easily obtaining bitcoins in the first place. With most successful exchanges having to toe the line and impose strict KYC rules, getting bitcoins is still one of the biggest problems for non-technical users who simply want an easy way to use it without jumping through numerous administrative hoops.      OTC exchanges such as LocalBitcoins are one way, but it still takes effort, and there's a learning curve. Various peer-to-peer exchanges have been proposed, with a simple desktop client providing easy access, but none seem to have caught on yet. Web-based wallets like Coinbase (currently US only) are probably the closest thing we have to an easy system for both buying and spending the coins, but even these involve client verification procedures that would turn off a certain percentage of casual users.      Presumably, a truly crypto-anarchist bitcoin wallet would want to step outside the banking system altogether. It would abandon the whole KYC burden and simply focus on uniting the getting and giving of bitcoins in a way that makes sense to the 75% of people who have never heard of them (and the small fraction of the others who actually understand what it is).      If that is indeed Wilson's goal, it will be interesting to see how he and unSystem do it. We should know more when the crowdfunding campaign launches, hopefully in December.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/30/shining-a-dim-light-on-dark-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fd143dc0f88327da5eeb9969567993487f2c573-1028x771.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
