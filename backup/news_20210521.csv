42386803,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVMxd,1621633882,PizzaDAO Celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day With 1M Slice Giveaway,"To celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day on Saturday, a group of “incredible strangers on the internet” is treating people worldwide to a million free slices.      The project, PizzaDAO’s Rare Pizzas, is providing this pie bounty by selling thousands of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the metaverse. Thousands of pizza NFTs from over 300 artists have sold for roughly $1.5 million since March 2021.      Sam Weinrott, aka Snackman, a member of the Rare Pizzas team, said the project has a shop in Cryptovoxels selling “virtual pizzas” to raise money and support local pizzerias around the world that have been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.      “We believe that there's not a pizza scarcity problem, there's a pizza distribution problem,” Weinrott said. “Anyone who just wants to celebrate pizza and cryptocurrency can join us. We're inviting the world to join us at our pizza party.”      PizzaDAO says it has onboarded roughly 380 pizza shops on six continents since first being conceived on Clubhouse in February.      Weinrott described the effort as a “global bake sale,” with 51% of the proceeds going to pizzerias all over the world and the remaining 49% going toward paying the team.    Bitcoin Pizza Day    Bitcoin Pizza Day commemorates the first commercial transaction using bitcoin as currency. On May 22, 2010, when bitcoin was a little over a year old. programmer Laszlo Hanyecz used bitcoin to buy two Papa John’s pizzas for 10,000 BTC. At today’s price, that bitcoin is worth about $352.4 million.

42386815,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVNCj,1621633684,The May 19 Sell-Off Actually Strengthened Bitcoin's Narrative,"May 19 was the worst day bitcoin has seen this year and left some watchers wondering: Did it destroy bitcoin's narrative? The answer is, for those watching closely, it likely strengthened it.      Here's why: bitcoin proved itself on Wednesday when it saw its second biggest volume day of the year, and market infrastructure did not break. Some exchanges suffered outages, but liquidity was available, as spot volumes show. Moreover, while a drop of over 30% may be dizzying for new buyers high on hopium, such events are not uncommon in bitcoin's bull-market history.      The chart above shows bitcoin-dollar volume on the 11 exchanges that are eligible as components of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). That means these markets are accessible to U.S. investors, have transparent ownership and do not place limits on bitcoin or dollar withdrawals, among other criteria.      The chart shows how the May 19 sell-off compared, in bitcoin terms, to volume traded in the Jan. 10 sell-off, as dogecoin and GameStop mania peaked on Jan. 22, and during a second sell-off in February.    Read more: Bitcoin Drops Below $31K Before Rebounding; $8B in Liquidations Triggered    The bitcoin-dollar markets in general are useful to watch, because they can indicate activity at a well-known market entry point – a place where new entrants ""buying the dip"" are likely to place orders.      More narrowly, XBX eligibility means these exchanges can attract institutional activity as well. In particular, LMAX Digital serves institutional clients exclusively, and Coinbase (marked here as Coinbase Pro) volume is 64% institutional, according to the company's latest earnings report.      (To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday, sign up for CoinDesk Indexes’ weekly newsletter, “The Hard Fork”.)      Coinbase specifically set records on Wednesday, handling over $4 billion in notional BTC/USD volume for the first time. (It was not a record in bitcoin units. That record was set Dec. 13 2015, when 165,543 BTC changed hands on Coinbase dollar markets. For context, December 2015 saw bitcoin trading up into the $400s, four months into a bull market that would last through December 2017.) Coinbase ETH/USD markets also handled record volume in both ETH and dollar terms on Wednesday, 1.7 million ETH valued in aggregate at $4.5 billion.      The fact that spot market volume can crescendo like this is an indicator of market maturity, at least in these two blue-chip cryptocurrencies: capital is able to flow in as the price drops, and sellers are finding buyers on the way down.    Futures markets situation normal    Meanwhile, in offshore derivatives markets, all was normal. Wednesday put this week over $4 billion in bitcoin futures liquidations.      As this chart, pulled Thursday from skew.com, shows, this past week was only the third-highest week for liquidations so far in 2021, and it's the fourth time this year bitcoin futures liquidations have crossed $4 billion in notional value. Offshore futures markets did not artificially flash-crash the price.    Bitcoin dips    Wednesday's bitcoin price drop was swifter and deeper than any so far this year. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) low, struck in the wee hours UTC time at $30,037.61, was 54% off its all-time high, 41% off its price before Elon Musk started tweeting and 30% off the prior day's closing price at midnight UTC.      It's the third time this year bitcoin has entered ""bear market"" territory, by equity markets' rule of thumb, which is a 20% drop. The two prior occasions occurred as the XBX made its way to its current all-time high ($64,888.19, set on April 14). Some bear market.      On any time scale, a 30% intra-day drop is unusual for bitcoin. Matt Weller of forex.com presented this illustrative chart Wednesday afternoon on ""All About Bitcoin"" on CoinDesk TV.      The chart shows how, in the bull market that began in the second half of 2015, bitcoin saw eight drawdowns of 30% or more. None of them took place in the course of a single 24-hour day. But they all took place during a longer upward trend that took bitcoin’s price from $200 to $20,000.      The current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022. That’s a big if, but also a popular one.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,"Galen Moore, Shuai Hao",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/21/the-may-19-sell-off-actually-strengthened-bitcoins-narrative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c24e00e6a16cb80f0eaf61c13674b32387bde67-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386812,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVN6R,1621631665,CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges,"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), seen as a proxy for institutional trading activity, has risen back to the number two spot on the list of biggest bitcoin futures exchanges by open interest.      However, the climb does not necessarily imply an uptick in institutional participation but looks to have stemmed from a relatively bigger drop in open interest on other exchanges on Wednesday.      Bybit's open interest fell by nearly $1 billion on Wednesday, while the value of open positions on OKEx declined by $1.2 billion; Binance's total dropped by $1.7 billion. The CME's tally declined by just $30 million.      The CME now accounts for $1.92 billion, or 15.5%, of the total open interest of $12.38 billion, according to data source Skew.      That makes the global derivatives giant the second-largest bitcoin futures venue – a significant improvement from its fifth place at the beginning of the week.      Read more: Institutional Bitcoin Buying Spiked Around Wednesday's Crash      Binance holds the top spot with an open interest of $2.17 billion, while Bybit, OKEx and crypto options heavyweight Deribit rank third, fourth, and fifth.      The changes in the rankings after the price crash highlight the perils of excess leverage and retail speculation. ByBit, OKEx, Binance and most other non-regulated exchanges offer 100 times or more leverage, allowing users to trade up to $100 in value for every $1 in the trading account.      As such, traders typically flock to such platforms, particularly during a bull run. Bybit rose past the CME to become the second-largest futures exchange by open interest in the first quarter.      However, the excess leverage brings massive liquidations (forced closure of long/short positions due to margin shortage) during a price slide, as seen on Monday.      Differences in the product specifications also play a role. For instance, most exchanges, excluding the CME, offer bitcoin-margined futures – contracts settled and margined with bitcoin instead of cash – which amplify the downside due to convexity, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital.      Contracts settled and margined in bitcoin (the underlying asset) have a non-linear nature – the loss in bitcoin terms on each contract does not correlate linearly with changes in bitcoin's price. So traders lose more money when the market falls and make less money when it rises, as noted by OKEx in a blog post. Thus, these products see massive liquidations during a crash.      ""CME is now the second-largest contributor to the [open interest], which goes to show how negative convexity impact bitcoin market structure and that the market is generally heading towards stablecoin-margined products,"" Vinokourov said.      The latest rise in CME's ranking differs from the one in the final quarter of 2020, when the exchange climbed ranks to become the biggest on the back of increased institutional buying.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/21/cme-returns-to-second-place-in-latest-rankings-of-bitcoin-futures-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bdd45e8fd33fdd981b6e2b6a1e65cd8cf9a4e7ff-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

News out of China had traders hitting the sell button during a two-hour dump before the selling leveled off.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $36,224 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 9.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $36,224-$42,163 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,363 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the red 15.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,363-$2,929 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin slips as volume evaporates    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down 9.7% as of press time Friday. BTC was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.      According to spot data from Bitstamp, BTC is headed for its second straight week declining 20% or more, on track for a 37% decline over the two-week period, on a par with March 2020’s market bloodbath.      The main catalyst for the move down Friday was a statement from a China’s State Council on BTC: “We should crack down on bitcoin mining and trading activities and prevent individual risks from being passed to the whole society.”      Within two hours, bitcoin fell from $41,454 around 14:15 UTC (10:15 a.m. ET) to as low as $36,880, an 11% decrease, based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin is still falling, at $36,224 as of press time.      “I expect BTC/USD to range around $38,000 for a while,” said George Clayton, managing partner at investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital.      After a 2021 record volume day for bitcoin on Wednesday, Friday is shaping up to be a downer heading into the weekend. At around $4 billion Friday, volume has decreased 75% decrease from $16 billion in volume on Wednesday, based on CoinDesk Research’s data on eight major spot bitcoin exchanges.    Anticipating consolidation    Neil Van Huis, director of sales and institutional trading at crypto market maker Blockfills, says “consolidation,” a period of low volume and subsequent price discovery due to lack of liquidity, might be a market factor this weekend.      “I’m anticipating some consolidation where markets may have previously broken out from,” said Van Huis. “I think the market appears to be digesting the move down in a very fair fashion and we will soon know what it wants to do next.”      Read More: Institutional Bitcoin Buying Spiked Around Wednesday’s Crash    Bitcoin options traders don’t know what to do with $50K    In the bitcoin derivatives market over 16,700 BTC is centered on a $50,000 strike price, the highest open interest. However, the split between puts and calls is almost even. A put is a right but not an obligation to sell an asset while a call is the right but not an obligation to buy an asset - both within a specific time frame, known as expiration.      It’s an intriguing development because bitcoin has not been at the $50,000 price level in over a week and it’s possibly a sign smart options traders are taking both sides of the trade at that level.      “The open interest doesn't indicate directionality,” noted Vishal Shah, founder of crypto derivatives exchange Alpha5.    ETH volatility up    Since the beginning of April, 30-day volatility for 10 brand-name crypto assets on the CoinDesk 20 have all climbed, including bitcoin. However, it is ethereum classic (ETC) and ether that are in the stratosphere of wild price gyrations. Both assets have over 30-day volatility at 250% as of closing data from Thursday.      “The part that stands out the most is that volatility has exploded recently, with many assets experiencing over 200% realized, which is huge,” said Rich Rosenblum, president of crypto market maker GSR. “Then, at the same time, BTC volatility is elevated vs. its lull a few weeks ago, but certainly muted relative to the rest, staying at under 100%.”      Greg Magadini, chief executive officer, Genesis Volatility, noted that ETH’s “DVOL” metric, which is a volatility measure similar to traditional markets’ VIX and tracked by options exchange Deribit, is up to 180. It’s record high was Thursday, at 190. He says realized volatility, which is derived from analyzing historical returns, is now priced into the market.      ""Although we've come down from peak realized volatility seen in the past few days, over +300%, volatility is known to cluster,” said Magadini. “The options markets are pricing in over +100% implied volatility for all expirations and about 150% for near-dated options.”    Ether dominance dumps    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $2,363 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 15.5% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.      Ether dumped from $2,740 around 14:15 UTC (10:15 a.m. ET) to $2,426 by 16:15 UTC (12:15 p.m. ET), a $314 decrease based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH is still slipping, at $2,363 as of press time.      Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics platform Trade the Chain, says major blockchain assets like bitcoin and ether are still seen positively, despite recent price dumps and volatility jumps.      “Going forward, long-term sentiment scores for most crypto, especially bitcoin and ether, are still high, in the 70s, despite all of the recent turmoil,” Mancini. “which means the bullish thesis remains intact.”      The bullish thesis may be holding overall, but traders have clearly been losing some interest in ether versus other cryptocurrencies. Ether’s dominance, its share of the greater cryptocurrency market, has started to drop. After hitting a 2021 high of 20.61% May 15, ETH dominance has started to falter, below 18% share and down 2% the past 24 hours as of press time.

It’s a point worth raising, considering Dalio’s long-standing view that bitcoin is bubble-prone and a possible target for government sanctions.      The founder of what’s regularly called the world’s largest hedge fund by assets, Bridgewater Associates, which runs algorithmic strategies for mega-corporations, sovereign wealth funds and state pension plans, takes a macro view of global finance. And much of its success, Dalio says, lies in the founder’s heterodox view of money and credit.    Consensus 2021: Ray Dalio will appear at this year’s CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 conference on May 24 at 9:20 a.m. ET. Register here.    “Most of what people think is money is really credit, and it does disappear. As implied by this, a big part of the deleveraging process is people discovering that much of what they thought was their wealth isn’t really there,” Dalio wrote in a 2008 blog post, titled “How the Economic Machine Works and How It Is Reflected Now,” during the height of the financial crisis and updated in 2011.      Bitcoiners, by contrast, in the extreme, believe fiat money – or money that has value because it's backed by state authority – is illusory. Bitcoin is a monetary framework created as an alternative to a system where the Federal Reserve can print endlessly and private banks can increase the money supply by issuing loans. Bitcoin is a machine with brakes.    Read more: Bitcoin Is ‘Armageddon Insurance’    Dalio saw how the economic machine could malfunction. As early as 2006 he diagnosed a financial system buoyed by money printing and reliant on highly-leveraged positions for returns. Debt exceeded income. His firm calculated there was some $839 billion in bad debt in the U.S. that could implode, a figure he took to the U.S. Treasury Department in early 2007 as an unheeded siren’s song.      What’s more, Dalio figured that heavily indebted countries only had one way out of the hole: printing more money to finance their public and private debts. Beyond devaluing the currency, money printing would drive down interest rates and force investors into safer, hedge assets.    Bitcoin won’t escape our scrutiny.    “There hasn’t been a case in history where they haven’t eventually printed money and devalued their currency,” he told the New Yorker in 2011. (A sentence that could have been uttered by crypto doyen Meltem Demirors.)      Bridgewater’s flagship Pure Alpha fund (named for the rate money earns above normal market returns) positioned itself defensively ahead of the 2008 crisis. It went long on Treasury bonds, shorted the dollar and bought gold and other commodities.      When the housing market collapsed, Bridgewater did more than weather the ensuing crisis. Pure Alpha returned about 9.5% in 2008, 45% in 2010 and 23% in 2011 – years when the average hedge fund may have been in the red. Its assets under management (AUM) doubled to $100 billion in 2011 from $50 billion at the beginning of the meltdown.      Dalio wasn’t alone in his views about monetary excess. Around the same time Bridgewater was shorting the dollar, Satoshi Nakamoto was coding Bitcoin. Its first block contained Bitcoin’s mission statement: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” Lo and behold, the world’s first digital, hard-capped financial network.      Once called “Wall Street’s oddest duck,” Dalio’s heterodox views have maintained his fund’s prime position. The $150 billion fund routinely beats market expectations in an industry where higher funds are hardly guaranteed. (It should be said, Dalio isn’t always bearish on the U.S. dollar.) Meanwhile, bitcoin, a whole other financial beast, was the best-performing asset of the past decade, with annualized returns of 230%.      What then might explain the odd duck’s pessimism on bitcoin?      Dalio, who declined to comment for this article, considers himself a ""hyperrealist,” or someone determined to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the world. He reads history, is skeptical of emotionally tinged thinking and sees evolutionary patterns across society. Investing, like wild game hunting, is a risky, zero-sum business – but one for which you could prepare to gain an edge.    Read more: Bridgewater Associates CFO Leaves Dalio to Join Institutional Bitcoin Firm NYDIG    His “Principles,” a book of about 300 hard-learned lessons and aphorisms, sometimes called the ""Tao of Dal,"" advocates for “radical transparency.” Every Bridgewater recruit is to read and internalize the message: the world is comprehensible, and some people can be more right than others. Meetings are recorded and reviewed. Underlings, reportedly, are encouraged to speak up against their supervisors – just not behind their backs. (Dalio famously punched his first real boss in the face.)      It’s this commitment to the truth-finding process that may have opened Dalio’s eyes to bitcoin. He turned to Reddit and Twitter to get lessons in finance. In the past several months, Dalio has gone on record saying there are inflationary forces afoot and the traditional financial system is edging on bubble territory. And despite previously saying bitcoin failed as an inflation hedge, he now says that “bitcoin won’t escape our scrutiny” for a new alt-cash fund.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/21/ray-dalio-wall-streets-oddest-duck-shares-the-bitcoin-mind,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8608297703a87f3571e11badf01b29386a72e63a-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company said Sameer Ismail, 39, a stalwart of the U.K. crypto scene, had “wrongfully and fraudulently misdirected” corporate and user funds totaling £516,242 (US$732,495), all of which has been replaced.      When asked if he was guilty of stealing any cryptocurrency, Ismail told CoinDesk in a brief phone interview Friday, “I categorically disagree. It’s messy. This allegation of theirs [Uphold's] was directly in response to me filing a breach of contract against them.”      Prior to joining Uphold, Ismail held the position of chief compliance officer at Luno (now owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group) and chief risk officer at Denmark's Coinify in 2018.      Ismail was even hired by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to talk about financial crime and appeared on numerous panels to discuss cryptocurrency regulation. At an event organized by the U.K. regulatory body in 2018, he appeared alongside the FCA’s executive director, Christopher Woolard, and City of London Police Financial Intelligence Analyst Fred Ellis.    Read more: Uphold to Launch Crypto Card in Europe After Optimus Acquisition    Uphold said Ismail was put through a U.K. Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) record check before joining as an employee, which showed no previous criminal convictions or red flags.      “Bad actors are often difficult to contend with, but we were, with the help of our regulator, able to uncover Mr. Ismail’s deception before he was able to do any significant damage,” an Uphold spokesperson told CoinDesk in an emailed statement, adding:    “We took prompt legal action against Mr. Ismail and reported his actions to the appropriate regulators and police. We engaged a forensic investigator and conducted a thorough review of our policies and procedures.”    Customers suffered zero losses from the fraudulent activity conducted, Uphold said.      Since the case emerged earlier this year, Uphold said it has “instituted additional layers of stricter controls” to ensure similar attacks won’t happen again.    Past issues    Ismail’s work history seems to have flown under the radar of firms that later hired him. For instance, Luno, where Ismail worked prior to Uphold, confirmed in an emailed statement that there had been a case involving Ismail and issues around expenses on a company credit card.      “We do not in general comment on individual employee matters but would like to clarify that in the case in question no cryptocurrency or customer funds were affected, the issue involved personal expense claims on a company credit card,” a Luno spokesperson wrote, adding:    “The case was resolved in November 2020 in a court judgment in Luno’s favor. The judgment is a matter of public record at Birmingham County Court.”    Ismail appears to be something of an expert when it comes to falsifying documents, according to a private investigator who asked to remain anonymous.      The wayward compliance chief (currently thought to be residing in Dubai) is alleged to have absconded with over 35 BTC, closer to $2 million at the time, according to the investigative source.      In addition, Ismail is alleged to have photoshopped a fake seizure order from the U.K.’s National Crime Agency (NCA) for £103,000, and also created a fake invoice for a crypto asset license from the FCA for £10,000.      “This is the tip of the iceberg,” said the investigator. “He used a number of methods such as creating fake email trails from customers requesting for their crypto to be sent to external wallets. These wallets were in fact controlled by Sameer.”      The FCA was contacted but did not respond by press time. The City of London Police declined to comment.

42386819,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVNAD,1621625008,An Interview With Chainlink's Sergey Nazarov,"Chainlink is everywhere in the crypto ecosystem. Over the past three years, its underlying oracle technology – a way to feed external data into programmable smart contracts – has been integrated into over 300 projects. It’s become such a critical component of decentralized finance (DeFi) that Vitalik Buterin has called for projects like UNI to convert into competing oracle tokens to help further decentralize the space.      Meanwhile, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, has grown to become one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. A gang of so-called Link Marines – typically those with financial stakes – prowl Twitter to protect the reputation of Chainlink and its illustrious co-founder, Sergey Nazarov.    Consensus 2021: Sergey Nazarov will appear at this year’s CoinDesk’s Consensus conference on May 25 to discuss the future of oracle networks and their real-world utility. Register here.    This rapid success, and the bizarre cult behavior surrounding Chainlink, have raised legitimate concerns about the project. Buterin, for one, has said the system lacks a coherent way to penalize bad data providers. The Chainlink team recently released a white paper offering potential solutions here.      Chainlink 2.0 would introduce the concept of “explicit staking” and add a second layer of trusted oracles to supervise the network (more on that below). Though critics have raised flags here as well, it's hard to argue Chainlink hasn't found product-market fit.      Ahead of his appearance at Consensus 2021 I asked co-founder Sergey Nazarov about the challenges facing, and the future of, the multi-billion dollar network. He would only respond to “technical” questions – so no comment on the Marines, the token’s rapid accretion or Buterin’s proposal, unfortunately. Here’s what he said.      Has your answer to ""Could you create a hybrid smart contract to prove someone painted your house the right shade of blue?"" changed at all?      You can create a hybrid smart contract around anything that an off-chain data source can prove to be true. While there aren’t many data sources to prove the color of a house today, if there was sufficient demand for data that proves this event it would become available, and a hybrid smart contract could then be efficiently settled based upon that data, after being validated by a decentralized oracle network.    Read more: Josh Stark – Making Sense of Blockchain Smart Contracts    You've mentioned how “hybrid smart contracts"" are already revolutionizing DeFi. What's happening here?      Hybrid smart contracts are the combination of deterministic, on-chain code featuring high reliability, transparency and security, together with the real world’s off-chain events. This is the next step in the evolution of smart contracts as a technology. DeFi is a perfect example. You have financial products that are transparently operated on-chain but require interaction with the off-chain world’s data, such as price data, to come into existence. As more external data is validated and placed on-chain, even more DeFi smart contracts are launched, clearly showing that the number of decentralized services, in this case validated off-chain data delivery, is a key deciding factor in the initial emergence and continued growth of hybrid smart contract ecosystems such as DeFi.      How are participants in the Chainlink ecosystem incentivized to provide reliable oracle services, and what is the system to disincentivize misinformation?      The crypto-economic model that secures the Chainlink network is driven by both implicit and explicit incentives. Implicit incentives are also seen in existing networks such as Bitcoin. Miners in the Bitcoin network collectively maintain the security of the protocol as they have a strong economic incentive to uphold the value of their specialized ASIC mining equipment and their future revenue denominated in bitcoin.      Any malicious activity would lead to a devaluation of their holdings and loss of future revenue, which is how the Bitcoin network has operated without issue for over a decade. Chainlink leverages similar economic incentives to ensure accurate and reliable data is made available to smart contracts across a number of blockchain networks. With regard to explicit incentives, the recent Chainlink 2.0 white paper presented an explicit staking model that significantly increases the crypto-economic security of the network through super-linear staking.      How does Chainlink benefit from decentralized storage providers like Filecoin? What is stored that wouldn’t already be on a blockchain?      Between blockchain networks, Chainlink’s oracle infrastructure and decentralized storage providers like Filecoin, a fully decentralized Web 3.0 technology stack is starting to emerge in which smart contracts provide definitive state changes, asset control and private key access. Chainlink oracles power decentralized services for all real-world interactions, and decentralized storage networks provide efficient decentralized storage of data over the long term. Chainlink and Filecoin go very well together; Chainlink enables the input of data into Filecoin for long-term storage, as well as a gateway for smart contracts on various chains to purchase data from Filecoin.    See also: Juan Benet: From Idea to Action    What else are you looking to fund with Chainlink Community Grants? What are the biggest successes of that program?      The Chainlink Community Grant program has already helped support leading ecosystem tools like market.link and reputation.link, while also providing many original research grants for the smart contract ecosystem, numerous native integrations of Chainlink on additional blockchain networks, social impact initiatives for emerging markets across the world and environmental sustainability efforts.      Could you give a little insight into Chainlink's business development? How closely does Chainlink Labs work with teams on integrations?      As a permissionless framework for building oracle networks, many development teams go on to use Chainlink on their own by referencing the publicly available documentation. Chainlink is an easy system to integrate. However, we are always here to help teams that want to integrate their application with Chainlink and need custom support. We can be reached at integrations@chain.link. We have and will continue to help projects create custom oracle networks that are needed for more specialized use cases, whether it’s fetching weather data from a specific geographic region for smart contract insurance agreements or securely connecting existing backend systems to the growing blockchain ecosystem.      What are you most excited about in crypto?      What excites me most is fundamentally changing the way the world works to improve society in two key ways.      Firstly, the booms and busts we see with financial markets are based on information asymmetries that benefit the very few who can exploit them. Often, the rest of society is left to foot the bill. This is not right and has to change. Secondly, millions of users across emerging markets still lack basic economic agreements about bank accounts, insurance, global trade and many other contract systems that users in developed markets often take for granted. Hybrid smart contract applications can take the rest of the world from zero to one, regardless of their local system’s failings. This is perhaps the most worthwhile goal in all of contract theory.",NEUTRAL,LINK,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIL | LINK | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/21/an-interview-with-chainlinks-sergey-nazarov,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/824a2f50435e9f48bb9c462e5e7c7c58f898d807-1500x763.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386816,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVNBT,1621622388,'Grayscale Discount' Narrows to 10% and Could Shrink More as Lockups Expire,"Amid bitcoin's volatile price moves this week, a key indicator of market health known as the ""Grayscale discount"" showed improvement, data shows.      Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest U.S. investment vehicle for buying bitcoin through a stock exchange, is trading at a 10% discount to its net asset value (NAV), narrower than a near 20% discount a week ago. The discount is the difference between the price of the underlying bitcoin asset and the value implied by the price of the trust’s shares.      Some analysts expect the discount to eventually converge to NAV because the trust plans to convert to an exchange-traded fund. As CoinDesk reported on May 14, the set-up might offer an opportunity for retail traders to recapture the discount as profit while still booking any gains from the cryptocurrency itself. In other words, it might be a cheap way of gaining exposure to bitcoin.      Now, an additional factor looms on the horizon that might help to further shrink the discount: the full expiration of lockup agreements that have trapped some investors in the investment vehicle.      In recent years, accredited investors – usually big institutional players or wealthy individuals – could profit from buying into GBTC at the trust’s NAV. After a six-month lockup period, investors could then sell their shares for a profit in the open market and capture the additional premium. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, of which CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary.)      Last year, it was seen as a brilliant trade. But earlier this year – around March – the premium evaporated and flipped to a discount. New money flows into GBTC have dried up, and according to Grayscale, the trust has been closed to new investments since March 2 “for administrative reasons.”    Read more: Record ‘Grayscale Discount’ Might Mean Bargain Bitcoin for Retail Traders    By the end of June, the six-month lockups should have mostly expired, which means that any of the previously trapped investors who wanted to exit their investments would have already had the chance to leave.      “The unlock schedule should end by June and you won’t have many sellers beyond that point,” said Daniel Matuszewski, co-founder of CMS Holdings, a crypto investment firm, during an interview with CoinDesk.      So the bet is the discount might narrow further once those sellers are no longer exerting downward pressure on GBTC shares.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/21/grayscale-discount-narrows-to-10-and-could-shrink-more-as-lockups-expire,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42386820,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVNFF,1621616927,"Money Reimagined: Hey Elon, Bitcoin Can Green the Grid","Identifying a core reason for the gut-wrenching plunge in cryptocurrency prices this week is complicated because falling prices create their own reality, prompting investors to sell even more. In this case, this was exacerbated by debt. As prices fell, investors who’d borrowed to finance their bets had to liquidate them to cover their positions. This is an ever-present danger in all financial markets but that it played out so violently this time speaks to how deeply lending and borrowing is now integrated into crypto.      This hints at systemic challenges, a rich topic that we’ll save for another newsletter. This week’s column addresses a system of a different kind, in the energy economy. We take on one of the popular narratives that contributed to the sell-off – the idea, invigorated by Tesla’s reversal on bitcoin payments last week, that investors and companies should avoid it due to the high energy consumption involved in mining.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The mainstream discussion on this issue is frustratingly superficial, but so, too, is the standard “whataboutism” and denialism of the crypto community. I suggest we consider how bitcoin can fit into a system-wide design of the economic incentives that dictates how society generates, distributes and uses power. Doing so leads to a different conclusion, with mining viewed not as a toxic creator of greenhouse gases but as a driver of renewable energy development.      This will be a major topic at next week’s Consensus by CoinDesk, a huge, four-day affair with more than 300 speakers, including Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio. (Register here.) In particular, my “Money Reimagined” podcast co-host Sheila Warren of the World Economic Forum and I will lead two one-hour special sessions on CoinDesk TV on Monday and Friday discussing the opportunity and challenges that crypto and blockchain pose for companies and investors looking to meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives.      For this week’s podcast, we travel to Haiti to address a topic that falls under the “S” in ESG: how the ugly legacy of international debt keeps the poorest, aid-dependent countries forever removed from capital markets, and whether new blockchain systems of money and record-keeping can break that cycle and help these countries gain control of their destiny. We talk to Terry Tardieu, a Haitian author, entrepreneur and politician who represents Petion-ville in the Chamber of Deputies, and Daniele Jean-Pierre, the co-founder and COO of Zimbali networks, which delivers smart ledger solutions for the decentralized economy.    Bitcoin can decentralize the grid    The factors contributing to this week’s crypto market rout were many – from excessive leverage to China’s regulatory bluster – but two stories last week play a trigger role in shifting sentiment to the negative: the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack and Elon Musk’s newfound concern about bitcoin’s carbon footprint.      The first, which resulted in the pipeline owners acceding to the hackers’ demand for payment in bitcoin, inevitably revived the public misconception that cryptocurrency is rife with criminality and raised fears of a U.S. regulatory backlash.      The second took a once-popular cheerleader out of the mix, drew attention to bitcoin’s vast energy consumption and raised the idea that environmentally conscious companies and institutions might sour on it as an investment.      Yet, taken together, those two developments point to an opportunity to shape a completely different narrative, one that’s far more positive on the relationship between bitcoin and energy. This column attempts to do that. One can only hope Musk is reading.    Optimizing energy systems    Let’s start with these points:    Climate change is real, accelerating and demanding a major shift to renewable energy.  Digitalization means that, as currently designed, our energy infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable to attacks like the one that shut down the Colonial Pipeline and interrupted fuel deliveries along the U.S. East Coast.  Energy is vital to broad-based economic prosperity.  Bitcoin, whether people like it or not, is here to stay.  The economics of bitcoin pits miners in constant competition with each other for the lowest-cost, most efficient source of energy. And they will go anywhere to tap it.  Thanks in part to some ever-improving technology, renewables are already the lowest-cost energy source in the world. (By contrast, fossil fuels are commodities that are likely to become more expensive over time.)    With all that in mind, I’ll make the argument not only that bitcoin can be greener with far lower carbon emissions but can also help society optimize its energy system for efficiency, sustainability and security.      Bitcoin can help foster a more decentralized energy system than the one we have now. Our electrical grids are mostly built on centralized models, with large-scale generation plants and heavy-duty transmission lines carrying power from generation centers to the users in the regions. The fuel distribution supply chain is also centralized, reliant on single refineries that attach to single, long pipelines such as that of Colonial’s.      This structure made sense originally because, until humans understood the costs to the environment, the cheapest sources of energy were fossil fuel-based. Unlike abundant and distributed solar and wind sources, these were only available in certain places and required large-scale industrial activity to convert them into usable power. So long as we keep the existing hub-and-spoke model in place, we continue to justify and serve the fossil fuel industries that feed into it.      The inefficiencies of the existing system are now clear. It’s expensive to build, maintain and operate long-distance transportation infrastructure and, in the case of electricity transmission, significant amounts of power are lost between the generating plant and the final destination.      The system design also makes it an especially appealing target for hackers. Taking down a single delivery element, such a pipeline, supporting a large economic community offers an attractive payoff relative to the cost of organizing and deploying an attack. By contrast, it’s much less profitable for attackers if they have to go after multiple mini-systems to achieve the same impact.      We need a decentralized system, one that taps energy sources that are closer to users. Solar power in particular, and wind to a lesser degree, allow this. The model implies a patchwork of interconnected microgrids, each primarily servicing local residents but also offering backup to other users outside their community in case their services are interrupted or insufficient.      Designed properly, such a system would emit much less CO2, it would be more efficient and, because of its wide distribution and built-in “redundancy” or backups, would be less vulnerable to attack. Hackers would have little incentive to act as they would have to break into multiple grids to acquire the same financial leverage that the Colonial Pipeline attackers obtained in holding the entire eastern seaboard to ransom.      Tesla drivers have no use for the gasoline transported by pipelines. But one can imagine them happily tapping into simple, low-cost charging stations that microgrid operators set up around the country to help monetize their operations. This is the kind of system Elon Musk should want to see built, in other words.    Bitcoin as a force multiplier    What does this have to do with Musk’s new whipping boy, bitcoin?      It’s that bitcoin mining can help communities overcome the one obstacle that disincentivizes them from developing renewable microgrids: the significant cost involved in the initial outlay.      Bitcoin mining is location agnostic. It can be easily deployed anywhere there is available, sufficiently low-cost power and it immediately generates value. This is why many bItcoin mining operations in the U.S. are increasingly striking deals with developers of renewable energy infrastructure, such as microgrids based on solar, wind or small hydro dams.      As Harry Sudock, vice president of strategy at mining infrastructure provider GRIID explained in a recent episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast, miners can provide revenue guarantees to these operators, allowing them to raise the capital needed to start building their systems.      It goes further than that. As has been seen in Texas, where Peter Thiel-backed Layer1 is working, grid operators can strike useful deals with miners such that they consume excess power in periods where demand is low but turn their machines off when demand surges. This helps solve the so-called “duck curve” problem caused by household solar panels, which generate a lot of otherwise wasted power during daylight hours when people are away from home at their workplaces and not enough in the evenings when they’ve returned home. It makes the grid operator’s perennial load management challenges easier to address.      There’s a real opportunity here for policymakers to accelerate the buildout of renewable energy and build a more sustainable, secure system. But they need to start looking at bitcoin differently and think about what incentives could encourage bitcoin-underwritten energy development projects.      Bitcoin miners, whose operations often run on low margins, are ruthless in deciding what energy source to use. If it’s cheap they’ll use it, regardless of where it comes from. If explicit or implicit subsidies make fossil fuel energy viable for mining, they will go there. If we don’t change the dynamic, bitcoin’s carbon footprint will continue to be problematic.      Bitcoin is not a moral good or bad. It is an economic system, one that’s here to stay, whether we like it or not.      Decentralization, in the form of renewable energy created closer to where it's consumed, is key to a more sustainable future. Bitcoin, as the decentralized value network, can help engineer that.    Off the charts: It’s all about perspective    It’s striking that this week’s market sell-off precedes the pandemic-be-damned, in-person Bitcoin conference that’s taking place in Miami next month – one that Bitcoin Magazine is putting on in the wake of our own, virtual Consensus by CoinDesk. It’s expected to be a rather excessive affair. I’m not going, but many people I know say they’re really just going for the parties. It’s hard not to worry that a super-spreader moment looms. Even if it’s all innocent, as CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser points out, there’s something a bit unreal about the whole Miami crypto scene right now.      It was in Miami, at the North American Bitcoin Conference in late January 2014, that I first got wind, as a Wall Street Journal reporter, that people were having problems withdrawing funds from Mt. Gox, the most important bitcoin exchange at that time. A few weeks later, Mt. Gox collapsed and the price of bitcoin, which had increased fivefold in the weeks before the conference, plunged all the way to $200, where it stayed for some time. The prior price rally had turned the NABC into a raucous, celebratory affair, albeit with far less of the world’s attention on participants than is now applied to the crypto community. I wonder what the mood will be like at our twin competing conferences this time?      The real lesson from that 2014 boom-bust moment, however, was that, in the grand scheme of things, it was really quite insignificant. These two charts, offering two different time perspectives, help to illustrate that.      At the time, the price action seemed wild and dangerous. Looking back from 2021 presents a very different picture.      The orange arrow: that’s the Miami bubble followed by the Mt. Gox “crash.”    The Conversation: Musk vs. McObnoxious    “The conversation” hardly seems like the right title for this section this week. While it might seem preferable just to ignore the unseemly Musk-Crypto Twitter spat this past week, it’s an unavoidable element of where we are right now in this social media, meme-infused moment within the battle for money. It bears documenting.      Why exactly the richest man in the world thought it was necessary to stir up the crypto hornets nest is unclear, but in doubling down on his claims about the environmental harm of bitcoin while continuing to talk up dogecoin, that’s exactly what he did. By the same token, the bitcoin community didn’t exactly elevate the conversation.      There was so much back and forth between Musk and bitcoiners there’s no way to capture it here, so we’ll focus on one particularly quirky battle, the one he had with “What Bitcoin Did” podcaster Peter McCormack.      We start with the tweet that did all the harm, the one that sent bitcoin into a tailspin late Friday last week.      McCormack decided to go on the offensive. In a tweet storm, he drew a stark dichotomy between bitcoin, which he described as “the only meaningfully decentralized cryptocurrency,” and Musk’s favorite meme reference, dogecoin, “a joke” that “serves little purpose beyond coin-flipping.”      To which Musk replied:      A few days later, after McCormack had changed his Twitter name to “Peter McObnoxious,” he took issue again with Musk after the Tesla CEO had sent another tweet celebrating dogecoin.      As the replies built up, many from other prominent bitcoiners, Musk got defensive, drawing in his past as a founder of a certain payments app.      This was too much for McCormack.    Relevant reads: Markets get stress-tested    The very sharp price declines in crypto markets this week offered a window into how they perform under stress now that Wall Street institutions are participating in them while new lending and derivative instruments have added different avenues for speculation. And sure enough, the scale of what happened was magnified. As Omkar Godbole reported in his initial account, $8 billion in liquidations were triggered as falling prices forced borrowers to sell their positions and repay loans, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of downward price pressure.      In a post-mortem podcast on what happened, Nathaniel Whittemore dug into the sheer magnitude of the liquidations. The total had run to $10 billion by his calculation, with a whopping 775,000 traders’ accounts triggered. The remarkable thing was that traders kept borrowing money to put on leveraged loans to try to buy the dip but the price kept falling, which meant those trades had to be liquidated as well.      While all of this is painful, the process also serves to cleanse the market of a lot of overhanging debt. And that’s what lenders said had happened, with the crash leading to an unwind of “excessive leverage,” according to a report by Nate DiCamillo.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Michael J.

42386808,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVN2f,1621613293,Why It's Tough to Send Aid Money to Palestine During the Latest Israel-Hamas Conflict,"People around the world looking for ways to send relief funds to Palestinians after 11 straight days of violence are finding that sending money to Gaza can be quite difficult.      The past week of strife between Israel and Palestine has claimed over 200 lives, a majority of them Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Those looking to donate funds to local aid groups largely can’t because of long standing restrictions, by the U.S., Israel and other countries, on transferring money to bank accounts in the territories. Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire earlier this week.      “We’re not aware of this phenomenon changing or getting worse in recent weeks or during the military attack on the Strip. It could just be that people are trying now and discovering they can’t make transfers,” said Miriam Marmur, international media coordinator at Israeli human rights organization Gisha, in an email.      Banks in Israel and around the world are restricting business relationships with what they consider to be risky clients, along with Israel’s ongoing, severe controls on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza, undermine Palestine’s economy and hinder development, according to Marmur.      “They also impact humanitarian and human rights organizations working in the region as well as businesses who have employees in Gaza, and block families from sending remittances to the Strip,” Marmur said.      The use of sanctions as a geopolitical tool can violate human rights and halt entire populations from accessing financial services. Earlier this year, the U.N. called on the U.S. and European Union to ease sanctions on Venezuela as the restrictions – imposed with the goal of removing controversial President Nicolas Maduro from power– were exacerbating a humanitarian crisis. People in sanctioned countries like Venezuela and Iran are increasingly looking to alternatives like cryptocurrencies, that are relatively resistant to government censorship and other restrictions, to be able to conduct day-to-day transactions.    Venmo    Gaza is controlled by the militant group Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and Israel. Organizations linked to Hamas are flagged on the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) list of sanctioned entities.      On Tuesday, tech publication Rest of World reported the U.S. payment service Venmo, a subsidiary of PayPal, was delaying transactions that contained the words “Palestine” or “Palestinian” along with terms including “emergency fund.”      “In tests conducted by Rest of World, transactions designated for ‘free palestine,’ ‘Free Palestinian,’ ‘Palestinian emergency’ and ‘Palestinian fund,’ were all completed without any issue,” the report said.      A spokesperson for Venmo told the publication the transaction reviews were OFAC-related. OFAC did not respond to a request for comment by press time.      One Venmo user who goes by Rami for privacy reasons that appeared in the Rest of World report, was attempting to pool money for a donation to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF), an American organization that has provided medical relief in Gaza since 1992. Venmo eventually released the funds to Rami.      “I sent Venmo an email detailing the fundraiser for the PCRF and asked a pointed question about whether or not the word ‘Palestinian’ was what triggered their system to report the transaction. They ignored the question and released the funds,” Rami told CoinDesk.    See also: Venmo’s Censorship of Gaza Payments Makes Case for Neutral Platforms    Steve Sosebee, president of PCRF, said Venmo was not blocking funds connected to PCRF but was targeting a different organization.      “This is not related to PCRF. Specifically, it's related to the inability of Venmo to properly vet organizations,” Sosebee said.      On May 17, the same day Rami posted about Venmo’s review on Twitter, PCRF’s main office in Gaza was damaged by an Israeli airstrike. After the attack, some users began speculating that PCRF was a front for Hamas.      “How is it that an American organization registered with the U.S. government as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization would be considered a front for a terrorist organization that the U.S. government considers illegal and any support would be an act supporting terrorism? The two don't go together,” Sosebee said.      Sosebee added that PCRF had not encountered any problems with receiving funds so far.      PayPal’s flagship service also does not do business in Gaza or West Bank, although in 2016, TechCrunch reported that it “does work for Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal by international law.”    Bank restrictions and workarounds    According to Marmur, in addition to PayPal and similar payment services, all banks in Israel bar direct transfers to Gaza, while some banks globally have limits on transfers to the area.      In 2006, the U.S. Treasury Department prohibited most financial dealings with the Palestinian Authority (the interim government that exerts partial control over Gaza and some areas of the West Bank) because of suspicions that it was supported by Hamas. In 2015, Al-Monitor reported that banks in Gaza halted incoming international transfers to charitable organizations and, in some cases, froze accounts tied to charities.      In 2019, the Times of Israel reported the U.S. government had asked international banks to stop transfers to the Palestinian Authority to “pressure the Palestinian leaders to accept the Trump administration’s peace plan.”      “Banks around the world sometimes take individual decisions to limit transfers to Gaza based on risk assessment, even if there is no formal advice to do so or a block on transfers by their central bank,” Marmur said.      Organizations in Gaza sometimes have workarounds, Marmur added.      According to Marmur, some organizations hold accounts in Ramallah, a city in the West Bank region just north of Jerusalem. Even though no Western Union agents can be found in the Gaza Strip, a number of them are located in Ramallah, giving the impression that international transfers make it into the West Bank in a number of ways.      “Some [organizations] just have local accounts and hope for the best,” Marmur said.    Crypto    Although governments of heavily sanctioned states like Iran and North Korea advocate the use of cryptocurrencies to skirt sanctions, it is unclear if that is the case in Palestinian regions.      However, in 2019, CoinDesk reported local civilians were increasingly using bitcoin for international transfers and “to bypass Israeli control,” totaling millions of dollars worth of transactions, while some Hamas members reportedly used much smaller amounts of bitcoin for their own purposes.      In the first quarter of 2021, peer-to-peer crypto trading platform LocalBitcoins recorded monthly trade volumes twice as large as those in any of the previous three quarters in Palestine, according to Jukka Blomberg, chief marketing officer at LocalBitcoins. He also said that trading volumes in Palestine and Israel combined are fairly small, roughly $1 million per year.      “Drawing bigger conclusions from those numbers and trends should be taken with a grain of salt,” Blomberg said.      A spokesperson for peer-to-peer exchange Paxful also said that it has not seen big enough spikes in its trading volume in Palestine or Israel over the past few weeks to indicate a trend.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/21/why-its-tough-to-send-aid-money-to-palestine-during-the-latest-israel-hamas-conflict,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a34541694d67e8a3f58662ac782ced32f9cbfab6-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s now headed to Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts’ desk.      Bill 649 would create a charter that would give consumers and institutions places to custody their digital assets.      The banks will look very similar to Wyoming’s special purpose depository institutions, such as Avanti Financial and Kraken Financial. The bill also allows already existing state-chartered banks in Nebraska to open crypto banking divisions.      The bill’s passage came after a long battle between the legislature and the state’s banking industry.      “When the bill was introduced in January there was a distance between the banking industry and the digital asset deposit institutions’ proponents,” said state Sen. Matt Williams, chairperson of the legislature’s Banking, Commerce and Insurance Committee. “It was 18 weeks of constant negotiations.”      The largest disagreement was about usage of the word “bank,” Williams said.      While Wyoming SPDI banks may use the word ""bank"" in their name without any other qualifiers, similar crypto-related institutions under the Nebraska bill would have to put the phrase “digital asset” before “bank” every time they market themselves to customers.      Like Wyoming SPDIs, digital asset banks in Nebraska won’t lend in fiat, and each bank has to hold 100% of its assets in reserve. Unlike Wyoming's SPDIs, the Nebraska digital asset banks can't accept fiat deposits. The banks have a $10 million reserve capital requirement minimum and will be allowed to apply for access to the Federal Reserve’s payments system.

Bitcoin fell back below $37,000 on Friday as a top Chinese governmental body called for a crackdown on cryptocurrency mining, amplifying regulatory concerns.      Prices for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped to $36,800 from $41,700 during U.S. trading hours, erasing a sizable chunk of the corrective bounce from Wednesday's low of $30,201.      The decline happened after a Chinese government website published a statement summarizing a top-level meeting in which officials called for a crackdown on bitcoin mining and trading activities.    Liu He, a Chinese vice premier, hosted a meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee of the State Council on Friday.  “We should be more alert and look for potential risks,” according to a statement posted on the website after the meeting. “We should crack down on bitcoin mining and trading activities and prevent individual risks from being passed to the whole society.”  This is one of the most high-profile warnings against cryptocurrencies in recent years. The State Council is the chief administrative authority of China, where heads of cabinet-level executive department make national policies.    The meeting came on the heels of a warning against crypto trading by three Chinese financial industry associations and an intensifying crackdown on bitcoin mining operations in Inner Mongolia, which is one of the mining hubs in North China.      The market mood has recently soured on concerns that corporates may distance themselves from the cryptocurrency amid a growing chorus about the negative environmental impact of bitcoin mining.      ""Anti-bitcoin (mining) news regularly comes up, but this is worth monitoring,"" Thomas Heller, co-founder, and CBO at Compass Mining, tweeted. ""Miners in China I've spoken with are unsure of the impact right now.""      Last week, Tesla, the Fortune 500 company, suspended vehicle purchases with bitcoin, citing environmental concerns and dashing hopes for widespread corporate adoption. The company announced bitcoin as a payment alternative in February.

According to a report from the Financial Times on Thursday, the organization said: ""As the amount of energy needed to run bitcoin became clearer, this policy became no longer tenable.""  It added that the crypto donation facility had not been extensively used by supporters.  Friends of the Earth, another environmental campaign group, told the FT it was considering the issue.  Greenpeace USA confirmed the news to CoinDesk, adding that the energy issue is a wider one for the internet realm as a whole.  ""The problem is that, at the moment, only about a fifth of the electricity used in the world’s data centers comes from renewable sources, and that's not good enough,"" said Travis Nichols, Greenpeace USA media director.  Nichols added that Greenpeace is working to ""change the way the world makes energy,"" including bitcoin miners in China and major corporates like Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google.  On Friday, Bloomberg radio and TV host Lisa Abramowicz tweeted that asset manager Bridgewater Associates is warning that ""bitcoin consumes as much energy as some countries, a barrier for investors focused on sustainability.""  The news comes soon after Elon Musk said Tesla would no longer accept payments in bitcoin because of bitcoin mining's fossil fuel use.  A number of firms in the cryptocurrency industry are making moves to reduce their carbon footprint.  Today, the BitMEX derivatives exchange said it is committing to become carbon neutral by offsetting its emissions, as did New York mining firm Greenidge earlier this month.

42386814,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVN7h,1621597550,Institutional Bitcoin Buying Spiked Around Wednesday's Crash,"Blockchain data shows large investors remain confident of bitcoin's long-term prospects and continue to accumulate coins on dips, shrugging off concerns about the negative environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining.      Wallets linked with over-the-counter (OTC) desks registered an outflow of 10,292 BTC on Wednesday, when bitcoin tanked from $43,000 to nearly $30,000. That was the largest single-day outflow from OTC addresses in 3.5 months, according to data tracked by Glassnode.      The number rose further to 11,056 BTC on Thursday, hitting the highest level since Dec. 31 and taking the six-day tally to nearly 35,000 BTC.      Institutions or large investors typically make investments through OTC desks to avoid influencing asset prices on exchanges. Thus, outflows from OTC desks are widely taken to represent institutional buying – large traders moving coins from OTC addresses to their wallets.      The number of daily transfers from OTC desks (outgoing transactions) rose to a record high of 245 on Thursday, marking a 10-fold rise in six days.      ""Once again [there is] strong institutional demand,"" Glassnode founders Jan Happel and Jann Allemann said in a tweet, taking note of the spike in outgoing OTC transactions. ""Whatever bitcoin lows we will see this summer, they won't be for long. Might as well hold through.""      Institutions have exhibited a strong buy-the-dip mentality this year. For example, the seven-day moving average of daily OTC desk outflows rose as the cryptocurrency suffered price pullbacks in the second half of February and after Coinbase's debut on Nasdaq.      The average more than doubled to over 5,000 BTC during the drop from May 12's $58,000 to $30,000.      The latest bargain hunting is notable as it shows large investors aren't too concerned about corporate distancing from bitcoin due to environmental concerns.      The market mood soured last week after Tesla, the Fortune 500 company headed by Elon Musk, suspended vehicle purchases using bitcoin, citing environmental concerns. The surprise announcement came three months after Tesla announced bitcoin as a payment alternative, and weakened hopes for wider corporate adoption.      As such, the uptrend-fatigued market fell and witnessed the worst episode of selling since the March 2020 crash.      While institutions remain bullish on the cryptocurrency, some analysts do not foresee a quick recovery.      ""We believe that most of the leverage is out of the system now, and bitcoin should start to form a base here,"" Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, told CoinDesk. ""However, the sharp fall – 40% between Sunday and Wednesday – has eroded confidence, and it will take some time for bitcoin to regain upward momentum.""      Exchanges liquidated nearly $10 billion worth of derivatives positions on Wednesday, leaving the market in a much healthier state than it was a week ago.      Balani foresees a rise to $45,000, or even $50,000, heading into the monthly options expiry due next Friday, but sees a deeper drop if support at $36,000 is breached.      ""A conclusive break below that would signal that this correction is bigger than a short-term, bull-market pullback and all bets are off,"" Balani said.      Also read: Elon Musk Says Lightning Network 'Needed' to Scale Bitcoin for Now      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $41,000, still up 40% on a year-to-date basis. Technical indicators are signaling oversold conditions and scope for a bounce.      However, regulation remains a critical short-term and long-term risk. ""Regulatory headwinds and global macro risk could weigh some more in the second and third quarters,"" Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said. ""At the same time, I think if we do see additional declines below $30,000, they will be short lived.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/21/institutional-bitcoin-buying-spiked-around-wednesdays-crash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b72a9c3a15fad4fbb64929db3117e4326dfb234-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) would be provided with ""necessary intervention powers"" to impose restrictions or even prohibitions on companies providing crypto services, according to an announcement Friday.  The proposal would bring the SFC more powers to protect clients against potential misconduct from VASPs.

Finally, Filecoin's comeback fared better than most alts, but its gains were limited to the $95-resistance level. Bitcoin Cash [BCH] Source: BCH/USD , TradingView Bitcoin Cash's bearish turnaround epitomized the change in fortunes of the broader cryptocurrency market. On 12 May, BCH formed a local peak at $1,642, but fell as low as $500 post the crypto sell-off. This represented a staggering loss of over 70% in just eight days. While BCH was able to recover above its 78.6% Fibonacci level ($747.4), the candlesticks remained below their 20-SMA (red), 50-SMA (yellow), and 200-SMA (green), at the time of writing. With capital slowly moving back into crypto, recovery for most alts is expected to be a gradual process and BCH was no exception. A key resistance zone lay at the 50% Fibonacci level ($1,075.5) and close to the 200-SMA. Reclaiming this area could trigger a price hike moving forward. Lower highs on the RSI pointed to a weakening for BCH even prior to the broader market pullback. A fall below $747 could open up some long opportunities. Some bullish momentum was visible on the Awesome Oscillator, but not enough to warrant a breakout just yet. Ethereum Classic [ETC] Source: ETC/USD , TradingView On the 4-hour charts, Ethereum Classic was at a crossroads between its 20-SMA (red) and 200-SMA (green). The press time level was of significance as it also clashed with the 50-SMA on the hourly and daily timeframes as well. The threat of a breakdown was just around the corner, one that could trigger a 30% retracement towards the $47.8-support. If the present support level is maintained, some sideways movement can be expected over the coming sessions. If ETH manages to claw back above $3,000, a corresponding effect would be noticeable for ETC. This outcome could result in a 20% hike towards the $88-mark. Bearish momentum was on the decline, according to the Squeeze MomentumIndicator, but this worked as a hedge against breakdown rather than a price rally. The RSI was being traded at around 40, at press time, and indicated weakness. Filecoin [FIL] Source: FIL/USD , TradingView Filecoin's bounce back from the $65.3-support triggered an impressive 42% price hike towards $95, but a breakout was denied by the sellers. However, the state of its technicals was slightly bullish when compared to most alts. The RSI stabilized just below 50, while the MACD line maintained itself above the Signal line. If the buyers prevail and push FIL above its $10.5-resistance, expect another 17% surge towards the $124.4-resistance. This upper ceiling presented the cut-off point for the bulls but if it is breached, FIL could see gains all the way up to $164.5.

The exchange is still investigating the most effective organizations through which to carry out the initiative, and said it will publish details of this and how much is donated in the future.      The donation works out at $2,600 per $1 million in fees received. BitMEX said it turned to calculations from the CEO of the FTX crypto derivatives exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried, for the figure.
