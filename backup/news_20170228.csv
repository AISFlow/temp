42427428,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKS3h,1488321634,"$1,210: Bitcoin Price Hits New All-Time High Amid Sustained Support","Bitcoin is showing no sign of dropping below its all-time highs.  After trading above $1,000 for more than two weeks, the bitcoin price has now provided what analysts believe is ample evidence the digital currency's price has established a floor at this level.  The cryptocurrency has been enjoying its longest stretch above $1,000 in history, a period it began on 14th February.  During this period, bitcoin prices have been pushing steadily higher, reaching a new all-time high of $1,186.33 on 23rd February and then rising to new record levels over the following sessions, according to the USD CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The digital currency most recently hit a fresh all-time high today, when it reached $1,210.16 at 03:00 UTC, BPI figures show.  At the time of report, bitcoin prices had pulled back slightly from this level, trading at $1,196.38.  Potential upside  Many market observers have emphasized that bitcoin prices could soon enjoy significant upside if the SEC approves the proposed Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, an investment fund which has an approval deadline on 11th March.  Traders have already incorporated this event into bitcoin prices, according to several analysts.  However, many market observers have projected that the proposed fund has low odds of receiving authorization from the government agency.  Investor and serial entrepreneur Vinny Lingham, for example, gave the fund 10-15% odds of being approved in a recent blog post, while Spencer Bogart, former analyst with investment bank Needham & Co LLC, has indicated the ETF's odds of approval are less than 25%.  While acceptance could fuel sharp price gains, a rejection could push bitcoin prices lower, analysts say.  Still, amid this uncertain situation, bitcoin prices have been experiencing little volatility in the last few days, moving largely between $1,170 and $1,210 even as they have enjoyed a steady, upward climb.

42427415,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKRdh,1488302714,Vitalik Buterin Calls for Collaboration at Enterprise Ethereum Launch,"In a televised speech at the launch of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance today, ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin, focused on why enterprise blockchains, generally seen as competitors to public networks, might have an interest in working together.  Announced today, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is a new group of major companies that plans to develop blockchain applications on ethereum (think Microsoft and JPMorgan). Long-rumored, the event today served as a coming out party for the incumbents and startups involved.  In the video, Buterin outlined a technical ethereum roadmap and ended with a summary of the synergies between private and public versions of ethereum.  Notably, Buterin never mentioned the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance by name, but spoke generally to the differences between public and enterprise implementations, as well as the challenges that both types of networks will need to confront.  Buterin said:  ""In general, I think there are a lot of things that we can work together on. We have shared challenges. If challenges get solved in one context, the solutions can be ported over to another context.""  Buterin is also a representative of the Ethereum Foundation, the Swiss non-profit organization founded to support the public ethereum network. However, Buterin has long shown a willingness to cross the aisle and work with corporates.  The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is the latest consortium focused on blockchain technology to emerge, adding to a group that includes the Hyperledger project and banking consortium R3CEV, the latter of which has collaborated with Buterin on reports for its member institutions.  Shared challenges  One example Buterin listed as an area of mutual concern for both groups is the optimization of the ethereum virtual machine (EVM), the key innovation that makes it possible for ethereum to deploy more complicated smart contracts.  Both private and public versions will need to use it, and Buterin believes that, perhaps, the two communities can pair up to solve issues confronting its more widespread implementation and use.  The comments are noteworthy as some in the ethereum community seem to view the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance as a Trojan Horse for the public version of ethereum, rather than as an end in itself.  Some developers in the ethereum community are also wary of private versions due to how they permission access to these systems. While the public ethereum blockchain is open for anyone to join and participate in, for example, a private version may be controlled by a vetted group of participants.  Still, Buterin did his best to quiet such thinking, striving to extend the olive branch as the groups look to move ahead on development.  He concluded:  ""I hope that the ethereum core development community and the enterprise community can, as much as we can, put our forces together and see if we can come up with some solutions to something.""

Speaking at the launch of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance in New York, Marley Gray, Microsoft’s principal architect in charge of blockchain services, revealed the news on stage to a group of about 500 people representing global banks, startups and competing blockchain consortia.  Gray said:  ""We are proud to announce that Quorum is now available on Azure.""  Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, which hosts a range of blockchain-as-a-service tools and includes support for multiple implementations of the tech.  Quorum is an enterprise-focused blockchain service based on the ethereum codebase, designed to meet industry demands for faster speeds and high throughput processing.  Also speaking at the event today JPMorgan's blockchain program lead, Amber Baldet, explained that her company began developing Quorum in an attempt to solve issues it believed were present in the current ethereum implementation.  ""That's what the initial release is,"" said Baldet. ""But there’s still a long way to go.""  JPMorgan and Microsoft are founding members of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, formally revealed today, along with about 30 other enterprise and startup members.  The project is aimed at better capitalizing on the streamlined services and potentially faster clearing times of transactions resulting from a shared transaction ledger – and doing so in a collaborative manner.  Baldet concluded:  ""We have to get over the hubris of thinking we need to build everything in-house.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Michael del Castillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/28/microsoft-adds-jpmorgans-quorum-blockchain-to-azure-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66e28b71df352e2815530b5c78ebf783536a0f92-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427425,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKS1h,1488293168,Central Banks Back Hyperledger Blockchain Project,"The Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston are among 11 new members of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain initiative.  Announced todayhttps://www.hyperledger.org/uncategorized/2017/02/27/hyperledger-continues-strong-momentum-in-2017-with-11-new-members, the two central banks join a group of more than 100 startups, financial institutions and enterprise firms that are backing the project. They are the first institutions of their kind to become part of Hyperledger. And while the Boston Fed has published research on the tech, the Bank of England, by contrast, has pursued a range of applications, including the potential issuance of a digital currency.  The slate of new members includes health care group Kaiser Permanente, the academic research group Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3) and China Merchants Bank. Among the startups that joined is Monax, which has submitted a codebase to the group with an ethereum virtual machine.  Executive director Brian Behlendorf said in a statement:  “We’re now at 122 members and seeing even more diverse organizations across industry sectors invest their energy and resources in understanding how blockchain technology can strengthen their own business processes. This new set of members’ combined backgrounds and experiences will be invaluable to the community, as we strive to increase production deployments through this year.”  The group has been steadily adding new members since the start of the year, including automaker Daimler AG and credit card giant American Express.  The development comes as Hyperledger’s backers move closer to its next software release, expected sometime in March or April.

42427413,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKRhh,1488290477,Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron Praises Blockchain Tech,"Former British prime minister David Cameron has said that bitcoin and blockchain technology have the potential to improve both financial inclusion and government transparency, according to reports.  Cameron, who served as prime minister from 2010 to 2016 before resigning in the wake of the Brexit vote, made his comments at the opening of new London offices for bitcoin startup Blockchain earlier this week. According to Business Insider, Cameron conceded his limited knowledge of the tech, but stated his belief that it could have a significant impact beyond finance, particularly in regards to public services.  He reportedly said:  ""Obviously you've got amazing opportunity using blockchain technology in areas like banking and finance and insurance, but I think some of the public policy applications are potentially transformational.""  At the same time, Cameron pointed to the tech’s potential to give those without financial access the ability “to be able to have property rights, to be able to carry out transactions”.  “Your opportunities, for instance in the remittances markets – a huge market, to help people have lower transaction costs and better property rights, are massive,” he went on to say.  The event wasn’t Blockchain’s first encounter with the ex-PM. The startup was among a group of businesses representing the UK's fintech space during a state trade mission to Asia, which Cameron undertook in 2015.  In this week's remarks, Cameron voiced support for the use of blockchain tech in improving the transparency of governments, enabling the development of “a sense of trust in the institutions that we use”.  ""I think you're on the brink of a very exciting revolution in all of those areas, which as someone involved in public life is very interesting,” he concluded.

Beginning 1st March and running through the month, BTCC says it will cease charging customers on both sides of trades on BTCC.com, its international exchange site. However, fees will remain in place at BTCChina.com, its domestic exchange offering.  In statements, BTCC representative Tendai Musakwa said the promotion is a tactical move aimed to outflank competitors by focusing on the exchange's international reach.  Musakwa said:  ""We're now focusing on growing more. Part of that includes learning from experiences operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange.""  The surprise promotion follows recent policy changes at the exchange following new regulatory pressure from China's central bank.  Beginning in January, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) took increasing interest in the sector, suggesting a number of operational changes at BTCC and its competitors, that have since found them losing their hold on international marketshare.

42427414,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKRjh,1488285036,'Big Four' Firm EY Begins Blockchain ID Platform Rollout,"'Big Four' accounting firm EY has revealed it is rolling out a new identity management platform based on blockchain tech for an Australian client.  According to EY, the platform is part of its bid to help clients better manage customer onboarding and verification, while addressing the challenges inherent in data management and privacy.  The firm told CoinDesk it has so far implemented the platform, built on the ethereum protocol, for Australia-based startup BlochExchange, which has built a blockchain-based fractional mortgage platform.  In interview, Michael Maloney, a manager in the Financial Services practice at EY, lauded the tech as some of the most viable produced so far by its internal R&D team, saying:  ""It's probably our most robust ethereum development to date. It really highlighted a lot of the promise of the ethereum network.""  Further, the project is an example of how EY believes blockchain could one day shape financial services.  Building credibility  The platform enables clients to create a customer identity using traditional know-your-customer (KYC) processes, and manages the distribution of that information to other trusted members within a blockchain environment.  Development of the platform began last November, Maloney said, and took the firm around six weeks to build.  BlochExchange CEO Andrew Coppin said the identity management tech has so far ""exceeded"" the company's expectations with its ability to enable third parties to store data for verification.  ""The benefits thus far have been that we have a robust system that has credibility in the market place,"" he said.  ""It's also allowing us to engage on a considered basis with other large blue chip companies and give them comfort of the systems and processes we have put in place,"" Coppin continued.  Future potential  Overall, EY sees blockchain as a foundational technology in need of platforms to leverage its capabilities, said Angus Champion de Crespigny, EY's financial services, blockchain and distributed infrastructure strategy leader.  ""Identity for us is very important, and we see it as one of the biggest applications [of blockchain],"" he said.  While, he couldn't provide any specific timeline for implementing the platform with other clients, de Crespigny said this is an ongoing conversation.  Even so, EY is confident in the technology and how it was developed with no major challenges on the technical side.  De Crespigny said:  ""We’re doing [the rollout] now. The platform is live, it's been proven, it's tested.""  Further, he suggested KYC, customer onboarding and regulatory issues are key areas in which the platform is ""very strong"".  In the long term, EY is also interested in developing an 'assurance product' around the platform, one that would ease concerns about adopting the nascent technology.  ""We had to convince people that this new technology and blockchain, that it was safe, it could be audited, it was secure,"" De Crespigny explained.  EY partner James Roberts added that the firm is in discussions with a number of major banks in Australia about implementing the platform, though he cautioned that these talks remain in early stages.  He said:  ""We are in discussions with three of the big banks in Australia.""

42427422,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKRth,1488277974,Blockchain Startup Selected for Airline Trade Group Awards,"An airline industry trade group, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), has revealed that a blockchain startup will be one of five finalists for its 2017 Air Cargo Innovation Awards.  With the news, Zurich-based Gatechain will join five other finalists selected by IATA to present at the World Cargo Symposium in Abu Dhabi, UAE, on 11th March. The winner selected by the judging panel will receive a cash prize at the commencement of the conference on 16th March.  Gatechain develops solutions for trade finance on a decentralized network, providing a blockchain solution to business processes that have traditionally relied on paper as a main means to store and transport information.  Notably, this is not the first foray into blockchain tech for the IATA.  In October 2016, the group awarded Travacoin, an Irish startup, for its work on a blockchain-based voucher system designed to simplify the refund and compensation process for delayed and canceled flights.  IATA is also working to develop 'single passenger tokens' to address identity management in the commercial aviation industry.

42427424,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKRzh,1488272193,Big Corporates Unite for Launch of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance,"A group of global enterprises representing the oil and gas industry, the financial sector and software development firms will today formally launch the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, dedicated to developing ethereum into an enterprise grade blockchain.  Comprised of British oil giant BP, bulge-bracket bank JP Morgan, software developer Microsoft, India IT consultancy Wipro, and about 30 other diverse firms, the group aims to reimagine the consortium model as a non-profit, donation-based system.  If successful, the model could have ripple effects for other fees-based structures.  Expected to be formally revealed today at an event in New York City, the Alliance is designed in one sense to more closely align with the open-source philosophy of its founder Jeremy Millar, while also giving large corporations and small startups alike a stronger sense of accountability for their investment in the technology.  At stake is more than the dollars of potential customers being spread across a rapidly growing number of consoritia working to leverage DLT technology – there's also increasingly tough search for talent to build actual applications.  Millar said:  ""The goal of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is to align the various interest groups, the users, the startups, the large technology platforms, to a single roadmap so that we can take those steps together.""  First reported by CoinDesk in January, we now know the Enterprise Ethereum is a 501 (c) (6) non-profit organization incorporated in New York City.  With the same non-profit status set aside for so-called 'business leagues', such as chambers of commerce, the goal of the alliance is to build out a series of standards for ethereum in the form of best practices, security, privacy, scalability and interoperability.  Founding members of the Alliance's rotating board of directors include Accenture, Banco Santander, BlockApps, BNY Mellon, CME Group, ConsenSys, Intel, JP Morgan, Microsoft, and Nuco. Blockchain educational institution, IC3 is also a board member.  Non-board founding members include AMIS, BBVA, BP, Credit Suisse, Fubon Financial, ING, The Institutes, Monax, Tendermint, Thomson Reuters, UBS, Wipro and more.  The news is expected to be formally revealed at an event in Brooklyn, at which a live version of an enterprise grade ethereum product is expected to be demonstrated in a transaction between Spanish bank, Santander, and US bank, JP Morgan.  ""What we will demo on stage is what Santander is using to run real money transactions already, internally,"" said Millar. ""We're going to be demoing a real app.""  Blockchain balancing act  At the core of the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance were two main objectives.  First, the group aims to create an enterprise-grade blockchain solution that makes it easier for its members to comply with various regulatory requirements based on their industry. But at the same time, it will help them better capitalize on the benefits of faster transaction times and higher volumes possible with a blockchain.  The result, Millar hopes, is a stronger private blockchain funded in large part by the enterprises, that trickles down to benefit the public blockchain on which anyone can build.  ""The public chain will benefit from permissioning,"" said Millar. ""The public chain will benefit from privacy algorithms, the public chain will benefit from fungible consensus algorithms.""  Second, the group is experimenting with new governance models designed to give the kind of control regulated enterprises need.  Specifically, a board of directors will help create a sense of accountability, while various other blockchain-based governance models are being considered to further empower the 'self-organizing' network effect created by authors of smart contracts and other code developers working on independent projects.  Millar said he’s a supporter of the decentralized management structures enabled by ethereum and other blockchain implementations.  But he emphasizes that the same structure that works for the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum Improvement Proposals on the open-source network don’t give enterprise clients the ability to conform to certain privacy requirements they’re obliged to honor.  ""They want to know that their voices are being channeled into the protocol in a way they’re familiar with,"" said Millar.  Getting paid in open source  In addition to meeting the unique demands of enterprises building on ethereum, the Alliance is experimenting with new ways to capitalize on one of the network’s most valuable resources: developers.  Initially, a technical advisory working group will consist of ethereum developer and zcash advisor Andrew Miller; Dominic Williams, president of String Labs (also a member of the alliance), and Bob Summerwill, Enterprise Ethereum’s lead architect and a member of ConsenSys, which has helped oversee much of the group's early development.  Founding members are not initially expected to be charged fees to join, unlike members of some other blockchain consortia, though Jeremy Millar said the founding documents will reflect the ability to change that policy if necessary.  In conversation with CoinDesk, he emphasized that while the project is open source and any one can work with the code, that does not necessarily mean it will be a volunteer operation. By focusing on rapidly iterating and improving products made by and for the Alliance’s members, Millar hopes they won’t ever have to charge fees to pay contributors.  ""Our approach as we develop a budget and need to hire people, will be to have suggested donations based on company size as a possibility,"" said Millar. ""We hope that that works, because it’s more philosophically aligned with an open-source community.""  He added:  ""So long as we are delivering in a high performance way, we will have access to the largest IT budgets in the world.""  Chumming the water  But another focal point of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is the fight for talent.  With the proliferation of blockchain consortia, the struggle to staff development projects is becoming an increasingly difficult obstacle.  Though exact developer numbers aren’t currently available, one potentially useful metric is the number of downloads of the Truffle ethereum development tool, which has currently been downloaded 43,821 times, according to the site.  Millar hopes that positioning the permissioned enterprise as beneficial to the public blockchain will help him win over some of that talent.  By comparison, a recent report by Aite Group showed that only four companies out of 16 polled had more than 100 employees. Two offerings, Hyperledger and R3CEV are consortia, and two, Nasdaq Linq and Digital Asset Holdings are private corporations.  To help bridge that talent gap, the head of wholesale banking at founding EEA member ING, Ivar Wiersma, said his bank has been in conversations with ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin since the early days of its experiments with blockchain.  Now, with 10 employees dedicated to narrowing down 27 proofs-of-concept to a few high-value implementations, his small team is looking to expand its opportunities to work with other talented developers.  Wiersma indicated that, in the current prototyping work using technology from Hyperledger, R3CEV and Digital Asset Holdings, his team meets with the partners on a daily basis. With Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, he expects even more opportunity.  ""On the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance there will be shared initiatives that we’re going to work on,"" Wiersma told CoinDesk.  Millar positioned the importance of developers in slightly starker terms:  ""They who have the most developers wins. Ethereum, as well as being in my mind the most sophisticated general-purpose blockchain available, far and away, by tens of thousands, has the largest developer community globally.""
