42385436,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1xJb,1609194607,Coinbase to Suspend XRP Trading Following SEC Suit Against Ripple,"Coinbase said it will suspend trading of XRP, the cryptocurrency at the heart of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against Ripple Labs claiming the token is really a security.      Coinbase first listed XRP on its retail-facing platforms in February 2019. Starting now, XRP trading ""will move into limit only,"" Coinbase wrote. It will be fully suspended on Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2021, at 1 p.m. ET.      ""We will continue to monitor legal developments related to XRP and update our customers as more information becomes available,"" Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, wrote in a blog post shared in advance with CoinDesk.      Coinbase said users' XRP wallets will ""remain available for receive and withdraw functionality after the trading suspension.""      Notably, the exchange said it will still support an upcoming airdrop of Spark tokens to XRP holders. XRP will still be supported by Coinbase Custody and in the self-custodial Coinbase Wallet.      Coinbase declined to comment beyond its written statement.      The price of XRP on Coinbase fell from $0.28 to $0.24 within the first 20 minutes of the announcement. Since the announcement of the SEC's lawsuit last week, the price of XRP has fallen by more than 50%.    Ripple effect    For Coinbase, the reason for dropping XRP as a traded asset was simple: As the company seeks to go public, being a platform for something that’s potentially a security would mean adding more paperwork simply so it could be legally allowed to let retail customers buy and sell a single cryptocurrency.      The SEC claimed last week that XRP is a security, and that Ripple has been selling it without registering or seeking an exemption for seven years, raising $1.3 billion in the process. The legal battle itself is just beginning, and litigation might take years if Ripple fights the charge in court, as it has indicated it would.      Coinbase is now the biggest exchange to act on XRP and could serve as a bellwether for other platforms. On Friday, Bitstamp announced it would halt XRP trading and deposits for all U.S. customers on Jan. 8.      Similarly San Francisco-based OKCoin announced its XRP suspension earlier Monday, effective Jan. 4.    See also: OKCoin to Suspend XRP Trading and Deposits on Jan. 4    Exchanges that continue to list XRP without registering as a securities exchange with the SEC face potential consequences down the line, including possible enforcement actions. However, should Ripple prevail in its defense, Coinbase can likely re-list XRP fairly easily.      Alex Kruger, a trader and analyst, said, ""Crypto exchanges are unregistered with the SEC (by choice, as registering carries on many burdens and increased costs) and thus it is in their best interest to not offer trading of securities. It is for their protection, not their customers'.""      Gabriel Shapiro, an attorney with Belcher, Smolen & Van Loo LLP, told CoinDesk last week that the question of whether exchanges should delist is a complicated one, with both business and legal considerations.

42385437,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1xM7,1609190409,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hovers Around $27K While ETH/BTC Pair Goes Bullish,"Bitcoin has mostly traded in a tight, low-volume range Monday while some profit-taking from bitcoin into ether is appearing on the ETH/BTC charts.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $26,822 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $25,759- $27,447 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC very near its 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price action has stagnated Monday, trading in a $27,000-$27,200 range for many hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The lack of movement follows a Sunday when bitcoin cracked an all-time high of $28,352, fueled by a bull run sparked on Dec. 25.      A bit of a respite is par for the course, according to over-the-counter trader Alessandro Andreotti. “I think it's just a minor retracement, a little pause after a week of all-time highs,” Andreotti told CoinDesk. “BTC is definitely still in bullish territory.”      Read More: Whale Sightings Become Scarce, Removing Downward Pressure on Bitcoin      After Sunday’s run that saw over $4 billion in volume on major CoinDesk 20 exchanges, Monday’s spot trading tally is much lower, at $1.8 billion as of press time. “Given the speed of the rise yesterday, especially after the last few days' rally, a slight contraction is normal,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer of quant trading firm ExoAlpha.      ""Bitcoin continues on its strong upwards path with more retail investors now moving into bitcoin over the holiday break,” noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin. However, flat spot volume may not be a trend heading into next year, according to Lau. “With the [U.S. economic] stimulus package being signed, the appeal of bitcoin as a store of value could continue into 2021.”      In the derivatives space, futures liquidations have helped to fuel bitcoin’s recent price run. This is evident in the number of liquidations – the equivalent of a margin call in traditional markets – on BitMEX. Over the past three days more than $116 million in liquidations occurred, with shorts being favored as buy liquidations hit $65 million.      “At this stage there is a clear lack of sellers as all the leveraged shorts are liquidated,” quant trading firm QCP Capital wrote in its Monday investor note. “The bull story remains clear: Growing institutional adoption of BTC is driving price higher and is feeding the retail FOMO, which then extends across all of crypto.”      Other analysts agree with QCP that bitcoin’s price push is allowing other cryptocurrencies, particularly ether, to start getting more attention. “I think the BTC price slowdown is giving some breath for the altcoin season,” said Misha Alefirenko, founder of crypto market maker VelvetFormula. The ether futures market is trending back up after a record-high $2.2 billion in open interest lost some steam after Dec. 19.      However, the news CME will be getting into the ether futures game is a positive sign for continued institutional interest in crypto, according to OKCoin’s Lau.      “Ethereum has maintained the upwards trajectory alongside bitcoin, reaching its highest levels since May 2018,"" said Lau. The CME Ethereum futures offering in February, ""could have a huge impact by exposing [ether] to more institutional investors.""    ETH/BTC Goes Bull Mode    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday, trading around $732 and climbing 8% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Cover Protocol Attack Perpetrated by ‘White Hat,’ Funds Returned      The ETH/BTC trading pair, a common offering on most exchanges, has suddenly gone bullish Monday after a long bearish cycle. This pair indicates the strength of ether versus bitcoin. The bullish signal on the hourly charts, including a spike in volume on Coinbase, suggests traders are selling bitcoin for ether.      Some profit-taking from bitcoin into ether is the main culprit, according to Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives venue Alpha5. “I think it's the spillover effects of BTC exhaustion,” Shah told CoinDesk. He also added it is likely hardcore crypto traders ekeing out more gains in this bull cycle pushing the ETH/BTC hourly chart up. “This entire rally has been born of bitcoin, so [its] hard to see it simply shift gears. And if it does, it's probably not the same ilk of investor.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Monday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    cosmos (ATOM) + 9%  cardano (ADA) + 8.5%  bitcoin cash (BCH) + 7%    One notable loser:    xrp (XRP) - 1.9%    Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 ended the day climbing 0.74% as investors exuded optimism amid fresh U.S. stimulus and the administration of coronavirus vaccines.

42385427,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1x8H,1609186215,Who Insures the Insurer? Cover Protocol Attack Exposes DeFi’s Promise and Peril,"Monday’s $4 million attack on the Cover Protocol, a decentralized insurance service, sent my mind to that classic nursery rhyme, ""There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly.""      You know, the one where an unfortunate woman keeps eating ever-larger animals to catch the previously swallowed animal.      Decentralized finance faces a similar problem with decentralized insurance. Decentralized insurance exists to protect people from losses if a DeFi protocol’s coding flaws allows someone to attack it. But what happens when there’s a vulnerability in the insurance protocol? What do you swallow to fix that?      Now, I don’t think DeFi ends up like the old lady – “dead, of course” – from eventually having to swallow the blockchain equivalent of a horse. These kinds of live, fully public situations, with real-world losses, are what drive open-source developer communities to build better stronger systems. That prospect is strengthened by the fact that this attack came from a “white hat” hacker rather than a bona fide crook.      But the Cover story provides a sobering coda to a year of startling innovation that stirred the imagination for a new financial system unencumbered by centralized gatekeepers. It shows how far that system still needs to develop.    Promise    This year, the DeFi “degens” showed us how to create a complete decentralized stack of virtually everything from the old, centralized system, with open protocols for exchanges, lending, borrowing, collateral management, credit default swaps and even virtual dollars.      This is exciting, not only because removing Wall Street intermediaries could reduce costs, or at least more equitably disburse them, but because it promises an end to counterparty risk, a core problem with the incumbent system’s closed, centralized architecture.      In the credit default swap crisis of 2008, market participants had no visibility into their counterparties’ multiple, hidden financial exposures, which is a recipe for mistrust. CDS and other contract-based instruments designed to help investors hedge their risks were dependent on the contracted parties’ ability to make good on their promises. So when people no longer believed in those promises, the rush for the exits meant those hedges were not only worthless but made matters worse. They offered nothing but systemic risk.      DeFi promises to avoid this. If a contract to deliver collateral in the event of a price reduction is executed by a protocol that draws on funds locked in decentralized escrow, with no single party in control of them, in theory counterparty risk is gone. The same theory applies to decentralized exchanges (no more Mt. Gox or QuadrigaCX), decentralized CDS and other parts of the DeFi ecosystem.    Peril    The problem is we’ve traded counterparty risk for software risk. And one could argue that’s even riskier. The caveat emptor ethos of DeFi is great for daring-do innovation and speculative buzz, but when there’s no centralized service provider to hold accountable and when hackers using untraceable pseudonyms can easily escape law enforcement, there’s little to no legal recourse after an attack.      For the bulk of humanity, especially the big institutions that manage our fiat savings, that scenario is untenable.      It doesn’t matter that all those institutions face their own software vulnerabilities. (A recent report by the Center for Center for Strategic and International Studies and computer security company McAfee estimated the total cost of cybercrime, including both losses and security expenses, will exceed $1 trillion in 2020.) It’s that if those “too big to fail” institutions’ losses get too big, whether from crime or financial panic, the government and central bank will ultimately find ways to socialize those losses. They just need an identifiable perp on which to level blame.      A decentralized system doesn’t allow for that, which is why it needs a new model of insurance against losses. The problem with that is, well, what happened to Cover.    A way forward    For now, the solution may lie with centralized insurance systems so that there’s someone holding the bag who can be identified and sued. Those services exist and, with an insistence on thorough, ongoing and top-level code audits, some will reach enough of a comfort level to bear the risk – at a price.      But not only will that add costs, it brings us back to the same counterparty risk problem. What happens if there’s a 2008-level system-wide crisis in DeFi? What happens when everyone fears a breakdown and no one trusts that the overexposed insurers – or their reinsurer underwriters – have the wherewithal to cover the fallout?      This is why, to attain the ideal, decentralized insurance is needed. It’s just that its development needs to occur live, in real-time, tested in the real world so that bugs can be exposed and patched.      And that’s why today’s attack is actually good news. An unidentified person seemingly involved with Grap Finance finds a bug in a protocol, uses it to drain a lot of COVER tokens, giving everyone involved a short period of panic. Then in a classic white hat move, he/she/they return the funds to the Cover Protocol and publicly announce, via Twitter, that they’ve done so.      Since then, people like Band Protocol CTO Sorawit Suriyakarn have worked to explain, in a similarly public way, how the hack occurred. While some might see that as an invitation for other hackers, it’s most importantly an alert to others within DeFi to patch similar bugs. Already, Cover has pivoted to develop a new token.      What doesn’t kill you will make you stronger. That’s the notion that will ultimately drive the DeFi ecosystem to create a scalable new model for global finance.      It’s just not going to happen tomorrow.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Michael J.

Other investors include Coinbase Ventures, LuneX Ventures and individual investors including Robert Leshner of Compound Finance.      This is part of a larger story of crypto firms seeking their own banking charters to operate as crypto-native banks. Recently, stablecoin issuer and crypto services firm Paxos and crypto payments firm BitPay filed to become federally regulated banks in the U.S.      So far, Vauld has established a foothold in India, where a favorable ruling from the courts earlier this year has unleashed a flood of crypto activity.      ""Hiring is the focus of the hour in the Indian market,"" Vauld co-founder and CTO Sanju Sony Kurian said in a statement.      The company, formerly known as Bank of Hodlers, will use the funds to expand from lending and borrowing to become a holistic banking platform that also includes payments and trading. Vauld also seeks to broaden its presence in Europe and the U.S.      “We see institutional capital come into the crypto space with the expectation of banking integrations to complement crypto credit offerings,” CEO Darshan Bathija said in a statement.      The company’s immediate aims include implementing an over-the-counter (OTC) desk, fiat and crypto order books, and debit and credit cards for multiple countries. The goal is for users to do all their banking on a blockchain.    Vauld goes international    Vauld intends to expand licensing across international crypto hubs including Singapore and the U.K. in the next 24 months. Bathija told CoinDesk via Telegram his company is also looking at Wyoming following the precedent of Kraken Financial and Avanti Financial.      This comes after a year in which two banking charters were approved by the Wyoming State Banking Board, granting Kraken and Avanti official status as chartered banks in the state. Vauld sees higher demand for banking functionalities for crypto assets.    See also: Kraken Becomes First Crypto Exchange to Charter a US Bank    Bathija said most regulators want businesses to first prove they have the governance structure to operate in full compliance, given how new crypto companies are in general. They urge companies to get lending and money transmission licenses first and ""wait for a year until we start applying for the banking license,"" he said.      Since its earlier investment of $500,000 from LuneX Ventures and a few angel investors in June, Vauld saw 950% growth, according to the company. Bathija said that is a “clear indication that yield products are valued and expected both in the U.S. and abroad.”      Investor Paul Veradittakit, partner at Pantera Capital, said in a press release his firm is excited about “Vauld’s vision to make cryptocurrencies the preferred instrument of banking by making it simple to use and interoperable with the current banking infrastructure.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SPONSORED,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/28/lending-platform-vauld-raises-2m-to-grow-into-a-full-crypto-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/544c719651754ba2683556799fa45d71056c5258-1500x1032.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The defendants were alleged of misleading investors to believe their money was being used solely for cryptocurrency trading via a proprietary algorithm, while Qin and the entities used the proceeds for personal purposes or for other undisclosed high-risk investments since at least 2018.  The investors have not been able to get redemptions from Virgil Sigma Fund as early as July and they were told their interests had been transferred to another fund, the VQR Multistrategy Fund LP, which was essentially controlled by Qin as well. However, no such transfers have occurred and the redemptions remain outstanding, according to the SEC complaint.

42385465,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1x9X,1609174410,2020 Saw the Fewest Bitcoin ‘Obituaries’ in 8 Years,"Bitcoin has been declared dead or dying roughly 390 times since 2010. But this year it’s dying much less frequently.      In 2020, bitcoin has been reported dead or dying only 11 times, per a list of these faux obituaries maintained by a Singapore-based website called 99 Bitcoins.      Bitcoin’s yearly “obituary” count hasn’t been so low since 2012, three years after bitcoin launched. The team behind the website confirmed to CoinDesk the list is actively maintained to date.      The sharp decrease in obituaries correlates with bitcoin's record-breaking price action this year after breaking its 2017 all-time high in November with a total year-to-date gain of over 270%.      In the past, it was “in vogue to publicly dismiss or even shame those who believed in bitcoin's value proposition,” said Kevin Kelly, global macro strategy lead at Delphi Digital and former equity analyst at Bloomberg, in a direct message with CoinDesk.      But now the game has changed.      “Mass retail speculation and viral memes have been swapped for family offices and world-class macro investors,” Kelly said.      Bitcoin's quickly-growing cadre of institutional buyers includes giants MassMutual and Guggenheim. And their sizable investments – combined with signs of rekindled retail interest – make announcing the bellwether cryptocurrency’s death increasingly difficult.      In a December bitcoin report, Kelly’s research team wrote, “Institutional investors have not only turned net long since September, but also the magnitude of their net exposure, measured in BTC, has increased relative to prior periods as well.”      Curiously, authors of disingenuous bitcoin “obituaries” have overlooked both times when the network actually has ""died,"" according to Pierre Rochard, Kraken’s lead bitcoin strategist.      In 2010, an inflation bug briefly enabled anyone using the network to create an infinite amount of bitcoins, which, for many intents and purposes, caused the network to die, Rochard said. In 2013, bitcoin “died” a second time when a flawed version of its source code unexpectedly caused the block size limit to increase.      “In both cases bitcoin was promptly resurrected by the collective will of its users,” Rochard said. To save the network, bitcoin nodes reverted to an older version of the software in 2013 and rewound the blockchain back to a point before the inflation bug in 2010.      “Few critics understand what happened when bitcoin actually died, twice,” Rochard told CoinDesk in an email.      In the aftermath of these incidents, bitcoin’s “robust” fundamentals and “rapid adoption” have created market conditions with multiple “parabolic revaluations,” Rochard said, increasing both its adoption and the attention paid to its technical strength, leaving skeptics with little room for continued death pronouncements.      As bitcoin lives on, “the career risk is no longer from embracing bitcoin,” according to Kelly. “It's from failing to give [bitcoin] the time and respect it deserves.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/28/2020-saw-the-fewest-bitcoin-obituaries-in-8-years,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca932ef8b8e5ec3bec1fba781abaa6bb9aff3d9e-897x582.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385435,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1xIL,1609171200,Charting Asia’s Dominant Fintech Frontier,"Since its cypherpunk beginnings, the blockchain industry has long positioned itself as something on the fringe of mainstream. Yet, today, distributed ledger technology experiments by governments, financial institutions and global corporations and broader digital asset adoption has reached a fever pitch.      Pandemic aside, 2020 has been a year of tremendous growth for the digital asset space. From China’s ambitious Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) to the launch of Cambodia’s Project Bakong, these initiatives have largely been spearheaded by traditional monetary institutions, a strong signal to the crypto’s growing credibility.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Amrit Kumar is president, co-founder and chief scientific officer of Zilliqa. His academic research has been widely published at conferences such as IEEE/IFIP and IFIP TC-11 SEC.    Interestingly, a lot of the most progressive developments are taking place in the East, in spite of significant disparities in digital literacy and technological maturity. Southeast Asia saw as many as 40 million new internet users this year amid the coronavirus, as consumers flocked to digital services such as ride-hailing, e-commerce and digital payments.      Whether it’s in developed or developing markets, Asia’s financial evolution remains steady and unfazed. From the rise of mobile payment platforms and QR-code enabled transactions to the uptick in e-wallet adoption, Asian economies are setting the innovation agenda across the sector. Infrastructural challenges or concerns surrounding cybersecurity have done little to hinder the digital transformation within the region. What is it about Asia that makes it so predisposed to pursue innovation at all costs and what will that mean for the future of digital assets in the year to come?    The fintech frontier    With a growing base of consumers, burgeoning financial infrastructure and the presence of some of the world’s largest tech companies, Asia is at the vanguard of the fintech revolution. For Asia’s developing markets, the absence of a deeply entrenched legacy finance ecosystem – coupled with high mobile phone penetration and limited access to traditional financial services – makes these emerging economies primed to leapfrog digital transformation. Eager to boost financial inclusion and reduce the use of cash, many governments in Asia’s developing markets have adopted a progressive stance towards the region’s innovation agenda.      Mobile payments have become the dominant and even the preferred mode of payment in countries such as Vietnam and Thailand, where over 60% of the respective populations are using mobile payments for everyday transactions. Cambodia’s Project Bakong is a blockchain-powered, all-in-one retail banking and mobile payments application. Supporting transactions in both the dollar and riel, the central bank-backed digital currency, is expected to help Cambodians make payments and transfer money between individuals using their smartphones. Introduced as a means of boosting financial inclusion in Cambodia, the retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) also serves to revitalize the use of the Cambodian riel in its digital form in order to challenge the domestic dominance of the U.S. dollar.    Asia looks poised to continue its trajectory towards digital dominance.    The Philippines also adopted a progressive monetary policy that has seen the legalization of cryptocurrencies since 2017 and, most recently, 14 crypto exchanges. Earlier this year, the nation’s Bureau of the Treasury, Unionbank and PDAX launched a blockchain app called Bonds.ph for the distribution of government bonds. The new mobile app will allow Filipinos, particularly the unbanked, to invest in the government’s new retail treasury bond and help the country raise funds to aid in its economic recovery and strengthen the COVID-19 response.      See also: China’s Xi Asks ASEAN Nations to Join in Building of ‘Digital Silk Road’      Amid the pandemic, Asia saw a significant uptick in e-wallet adoption within the past year. According to a report published by Allied Market Research, the global mobile wallet market was estimated at $1.04 billion in 2019 and is anticipated to hit $7.58 billion by 2027, registering a compound annual growth rate of 28.2% from 2020 to 2027. While high smartphone penetration and ease of mobile payments are the main driving factors for the adoption of digital wallets, the need for safety and security is often cited as a key concern among consumers.    Innovation hubs    When it comes to the region’s reputational standing with respect to tech innovation on a global stage, Asia is embracing the digital revolution on its own terms. Fueled by rising consumer demands for technology-enabled services and digital experiences, Asian governments have made the move to support the efforts of tech enterprises through planning, skills enablement and supportive regulation.      By prioritizing technology and investing in R&D, developed markets such as China, Japan and South Korea have built strong innovation foundations, and hold significant capital and knowledge to catalyze innovation in other Asian economies.      As the world’s most populous country, China is Asia’s anchor market, providing a connectivity and innovation platform for the rest of the continent. Leading the charge in the race to issue the world’s first global digital currency, China's state-backed DCEP project was created with the goal of replacing cash and internationalizing the yuan by facilitating its use in transactions anywhere in the world.      See also: Zhou Xiaochuan: The Father of the Digital Yuan      The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has already published a draft law giving legal status to the DCEP system, allowing the digital yuan to be included and defined as part of the country’s sovereign fiat currency. This draft law would also forbid any party from making or issuing yuan-backed digital tokens to replace the renminbi in the market. In doing so, China seeks to broaden its soft power by maintaining government control over the currency and creating less dependence on the U.S. dollar, while challenging the monopoly of existing digital payments players such as WeChat and Alibaba.      Singapore has also led research into CBDCs with its multi-phase Project Ubin, created with the aim of reducing cross border payment costs and speeding up securities settlements. Since its inception, the government has been actively working with the private sector in both the mainstream and blockchain sectors to explore how the technology can be utilized in a real-world environment.      As one of the earliest players in the space, the completion of Project Ubin phase 5 represents a significant step forward in digital asset innovation and acceptance in progressive Singapore. By looking beyond the feasibility of the technology – which they’ve since proven – they have now expanded to explore the utility of Ubin from a commercial viability standpoint. This is a promising sign that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has moved beyond legitimizing the tech and are already looking at applications, identifying companies who are willing to entertain the idea of integration.      Adept at reaching tech-literate yet financially underserved markets, digital currencies and fintech can play an integral role in Asia’s emerging economies by enabling greater financial inclusion among the unbanked population, particularly in remote communities lacking access to traditional banking facilities or countries with a low trust in their banking institutions.

42385433,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1xH5,1609167600,"That Decoupling Sound: China, the US and a Year of CBDCs","During the second presidential debate in 1992, candidate Ross Perot warned of a “giant sucking sound” of jobs leaving the United States for Mexico if the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was to enter into force. This past year, you may have heard a giant decoupling sound as the economies of the United States and the People’s Republic of China went their separate ways. It is no secret that after two years of a trade war, ongoing bans on certain U.S. exports to Chinese technology companies with links to China’s military, bans on the use of Chinese social media like WeChat and TikTok in the U.S., and denials of Chinese investments in U.S. companies, the two countries are at economic and geopolitical loggerheads.      The Chinese authorities, through the country’s Made in China 2025, have invested in a number of leading Chinese technology companies to dominate the future of 5G, artificial intelligence, genomics, robotics and semiconductor chips. The Chinese have used state-owned enterprises to bet on winners to directly take on U.S. big technology companies. One area of overt competition is in the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. James Cooper is Associate Dean, Experiential Learning and Professor of Law at California Western School of Law in San Diego.    For years, China has banned cryptocurrency projects, outlawed exchanges and even blocked industry meetings, while figuring out how to use the disruptive technology for a sovereign-backed central bank digital currency to further centralize power in Beijing. This past year, the People’s Bank of China has rolled out its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) initiative with a major pilot implementation project underway. Several lottery efforts to promote the DCEP were undertaken and a business-friendly, blockchain-services network was added.      The U.S. government did little to compete. In March, the U.S. government considered creating digital wallets for stimulus payments to the 17 million unbanked households in the United States. An early House of Representatives bill for the Payment Protection Program had provided for such a distribution, to the delight of many advocates for a digital dollar, only to see the final legislation forgo such a visionary step.      And so it was generally for the year 2020: Lots of traction for the Chinese version of a CBDC and plenty of retreat for a United States version of the same. Even Facebook changed its plan (and name) for its own digital token, the libra (now diem). In making his case for the libra back in 2019 in front of U.S. lawmakers, Zuckerberg threw China under the bus, stating that if the U.S. government did not let Facebook go forward China would develop and deploy a cryptocurrency backed by a sovereign yuan, scaled at global proportions. Zuckerberg’s testimony forced the world to wake up to the challenges that would come with central bank digital currencies. His testimony was also the catalyst for the Chinese authorities to speed up its deployment of the DCEP.    The decoupling has begun.    This year saw a distribution of the DCEP to all commercial banks affiliated with China’s central bank, namely the four government-owned banks (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agriculture Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank). Three telecommunication operators (China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom) are partnering. After the initial distribution to commercial banks, the commercial banks will then distribute the DCEP to consumers.      Different banks are choosing different issuing/distributing modes. Some banks may independently experiment DCEP through smart phone apps, or collaborate with telecom operators and put it within SIM cards. The People’s Bank of China is testing the best way for DCEP so as to encourage different banks to try out different methods of use. With Shenzhen and Suzhou as the experimental sites, the testing is underway. Once the Chinese export the DCEP through its One Belt One Road initiative, it will be used globally, potentially ending the U.S. dollar’s reign as the world’s reserve currency. It was no surprise that at the Group of 20 Meeting on Nov. 21, Chinese President Xi Jingping advised the assembled countries with the most developed economies they should embrace CBDCs and they should “discuss developing standards and principles for central bank digital currencies with an open and accommodating attitude.”      While the G20 met, U.S. President Donald Trump was hitting the links on one of his golf courses, ignoring the raging coronavirus pandemic stateside and not taking the initiative to provide for a much-needed further stimulus package, let alone one that rolled out a digital dollar and smart apps to make the distribution simpler. Could it be that such a digitization does not involve the president’s signature on the check?      See also: James Cooper – The New US-Mexico-Canada Trade Pact Holds Opportunity for Distributed Tech      And so the United States is still hesitant to move forward with a sovereign-backed digital currency. Plenty of others, however, are trying out the idea. We saw the SOV from the Marshall Islands, the sand dollar of the Bahamas, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank’s project and a whole host of other states moving toward this new era of sovereign-backed digital currencies. While Venezuela’s petro and Iran’s own digital currency project were doomed attempts at getting around U.S. sanctions against their regimes, a number of international institutions have used the year to develop technologies for digital assets.      The most surprising of these was the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the central bank for central banks, which was caught flatfooted when the excitement over private cryptocurrencies filtered up to CBDCs. In March 2018, the BIS undertook a survey of 63 countries around the globe and analyzed trends of potential CBDCs. It concluded“that each jurisdiction considering the launch of a CBDC should carefully and thoroughly consider the implications before making any decision.” Not exactly cutting-edge stuff.      The BIS moved from naysayer to adopter in 2020. And while in early 2020 some 80% of central banks (up from 70%) were investigating some form of CBDC, about 70% of central banks still see themselves as unlikely to issue any type of CBDC in the foreseeable future. But 10% of those surveyed did report they would be issuing a general purpose CBDC in the “short term.” It is looking like the U.S. will not be among those early pioneers.      See also: Marcelo Prates – Central Banks Had to Up Their Money Game This Year – And They Did      In the wake of the abdication of a greenback version of a CBDC, other countries’ central banks, the BIS and Facebook have all attempted the equivalent of digital asset mulligans this past year. That some central banks are now moving forward from study to deployment demonstrates the power that states have mustered in their attempts to re-centralize power. After the U.S. government, and just about every other Western government, went to the mattresses over Facebook’s plan to roll out the libra, it turns out that Mark Zuckerberg was right: The Chinese are going to be the major force in sovereign-backed digital currencies.

Hours later, Grap.Finance, a ""white hat hacker"" claimed responsibility for the attack via their Twitter account, saying all funds had been returned.      The exploiter has cashed out over $4 million including about 1,400 ether, one million DAI and 90 WBTC. The attacker earlier created 40 quintillion COVER tokens and sold $5 million worth of them on Monday morning. More than $3 million has been returned.      The price of COVER has plummeted to $177 by over 75% over the last 24-hour period, according to the data from CoinGecko.      Cover Protocol later announced it was exploring launching a new token through a snapshot ""before the minting exploit was abused.""      ""The 4350 ETH that has been returned by the attacker will also be handled through a snapshot to the LP token holders. We are still investigating,"" according to the project's Twitter account, which urged users not to buy any COVER tokens now.      Sorawit Suriyakarn, chief technology officer at Band Protocol, said the exploit's approach appears to be relatively new and was not spotted in any recent attacks.      ""The attack does 4 things: 1. Deposit LP tokens to Blacksmith contract 2. Withdraw *almost* all LP tokens to inflate 'accRewardsPerToken' 3. Deposit LP tokens again (this is the interesting bit) 4. Claim COVER rewards and trick the contract to mint quintillion of $COVER tokens,"" Suriyakarn said in his tweet.      The hacker tricked the protocol into minting new tokens as rewards by exploiting a bug in the smart contract Solidity, which involves using memory and storage incorrectly in the programming language.

42385434,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB1xFp,1609164003,The Rise of the Bitcoin Class,"I’ve tried various ways to convince my Dad, a typical Chinese boomer, to allocate part of his hard-earned money into bitcoin, but most of my pitches have failed badly.      For thousands of years in feudal society, the Chinese have a natural inclination to believe in authoritarian power, considering political leaders as head of the family. My pitch of “self-sovereignty” is not just quirky but too wild for my Dad’s generation.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Dory DeGeneres grew up in China and works as a VC in the cryptocurrency industry.    Thanks to the economic miracle of the last 30 years, China’s M2 (a measure of money supply) expanded massively and average household income and social wealth grew even more dramatically. Living standard doubled every seven years for the last 30 years. So the pitch to fight inflation does not work, too.      The inflection point came when my Dad saw the news on how Chinese regulators snapped their fingers and halted Ant Group’s initial public offering (IPO) at the last minute. Like many other average Chinese middle class people, he noticed that an admired self-made entrepreneur like Jack Ma is simply nobody in front of authority. If the mighty Jack Ma can fall like a leaf, it’s clearly almost impossible to preserve generational wealth in a guaranteed way. Many of the super-rich in China have been paying financial media NOT to report their wealth status because being loud can easily lead to being shut down violently.    The cohesion of this group transcends race, language, nationality and religious belief.    We may argue there is merit in regulators trying to prevent a potential negative chain effect of high-leveraged lending products in the case of Ant Group, but it also reveals that you simply can’t protect your wealth against authoritarian seizure, regardless of political system. U.S. sanctions are another form of seizure, framed in a politically correct way, weaponized under U.S. diplomatic tactics. So at the end of the day, you can only pray political leaders will adhere to what they promised: The private property of citizens is inviolable. They’ve written down such promises in the law, but is the law immutable? Can the law be 100% enforceable? What if they place the rule of man above the rule of law?      With more governments around the world joining the camp of nationalism, brewing strong handed leaders and populist administration, the rise of the bitcoin class is inevitable. This class not only possesses common socioeconomic status, but also common thesis towards life and liberty. Most importantly, the wealth accumulated by this class will not be redistributed by social turmoil such as wars, revolutions and any potential authoritarian seizure. Every 50-100 years, the social structure is shuffled, social mobility cycles through.      The bitcoin class will be immune to all these and quietly pass down generational wealth. For the first time, the division of classes is not by level of income, occupation, or any peer recognition, but by a string of binaries in your cold storage that only you can sign and prove. I can foresee this class to be an unique, shadow power in decades to come, influencing all aspects of social movements and public policies. They live independently, unite whenever necessary. It’s a meta-sovereign class that’s enabled by bitcoin, the cohesion of this group transcends race, language, nationality and religious belief.
