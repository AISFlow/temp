42398901,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhI2p,1456351734,"Bitt Launches Barbados Dollar on Blockchain, Calls for Bitcoin Unity","Bitt has launched a blockchain-based version of the Barbadian dollar, a new product that it believes will help its service appeal to underbanked users in its home country.  The announcement follows two days of local engagement, including a private launch on Monday held at local restaurant Buzo Osteria Italiana, and an international launch during a cruise on Tuesday that took place in conjunction with the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference in Barbados.  So far, the engagements have earned Bitt coverage from the Caribbean Broadcast Corporation (CBC), as it seeks to better highlight its goal of creating a financial settlement network for the 15 nations in the CARICOM region.  Bitt CEO Gabriel Abed said that the formal unveiling moves the startup toward ""phase three"" of its launch plan, telling CoinDesk:  “Our goal as an organization is to build an ecosystem. We launched our exchange nine months ago. Now, we’ve launched our second phase, the digital fiat dollar. Whatever you want to call it, it’s the dollar in Barbados digitized as an IOU that can be sent and received.”  Abed said Bitt now intends to focus on developing a teller and ATM network to allow users to exchange digital dollars and bitcoin for hard currency, and for the startup to compete against remittance giants such as MoneyGram and Western Union.  Bitt will now seek to equip its mobile app to allow users to perform know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks as necessary to help it build a network for currency exchange, he explained.  Abed went on to suggest that there is widespread support for the idea among potential users in Barbados, including small business owners at gas stations and barber shops who want to add new services for customers.  ""We have all these people who want to sign up because the solution has never existed before [in Barbados]. We don’t have e-commerce on this island, but we have 100% penetration of mobile,"" he said.  Launching in 2015, Bitt has so far raised $1.5m and built a team of 16 employees.  Technical development  To create its digital dollar, Bitt takes advantage of the Colored Coins protocol, which allows for the creation of new assets on top of the bitcoin blockchain.  ""This new layer can be used to assign a specific type of asset to a small fraction of a bitcoin,"" the company explains in an informational brochure.  Bitt’s version of the Barbadian dollar is therefore able to act as a digital asset, with its value honored 1:1 with the country’s government-backed currency.  Abed went on to state that transactions on this network can be observed by the government and local regulators as they are sent peer-to-peer to Bitt wallets.  In the future, Abed said, Bitt aims to upgrade its functionality via new technologies such as Liquid, Blockstream’s project that enables bitcoin funds to move between exchanges, and BitGo Instant, a tool that enables zero-confirmation transactions.  The startup says these offerings will help it appeal to users who may be turned off by bitcoin’s sometimes unpredictable market volatility and slow confirmation speeds.  Call for unity  In interview, Abed also issued a call to action that speaks to what he considers the vital need for next-generation money services options in Barbados and around the caribbean.  Most notably, he blasted the in-fighting among developers that he sees as a barrier to bitcoin-enabled financial services that provide real assistance to those in need.  ""I need the bitcoin community,"" Abed said. ""[Screw] Bitcoin Classic. [Screw] Bitcoin Core. This is our last fighting chance to have a global system before the government [restricts access to] bitcoin. [We need to] look at the ecosystem and realize this is possible.""  He further warned that the perceived limitations of the bitcoin blockchain are putting his business at risk as it seeks to help lower the costs of remittances for real-world users.  ""It’s time to push,"" he said. ""Yesterday was more of a formality. Bitt is here, we’re in your face and it's a free-to-use financial solution.""  Abed’s comments, while impassioned, sought to portray the larger goal of financial inclusion as an issue that has been lost in the prolonged conversation surrounding how the bitcoin blockchain can scale to accommodate new users.  He concluded:  ""Bitcoin's cool, blockchain is great, but we’re applying the tech in an ecosystem where that’s never been done before.""

42398896,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhHxu,1456349141,US Prosecutors Believe Ex-Secret Service Agent Stole More Bitcoin from Silk Road,"The US government believes that a former Secret Service agent convicted of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin during the investigation of Silk Road may have been involved with additional thefts from the now-defunct online dark market.  Ex-Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges was sentenced to nearly six years in federal prison after pleading guilty last year to money laundering and obstruction charges tied to the theft of more than $800,000 in bitcoin from the Silk Road during the US government’s investigation.  Bridges was re-arrested in late January on suspicion that he was going to attempt to flee the country. Since then, he has remained in the custody of the US Marshals Service, court records show.  Now, the government is saying that it thinks that Bridges may have been involved with other, previously undisclosed thefts from the Silk Road, which was shuttered in late 2013. The disclosure came as part of 17th February response to a request by Bridges for a hearing on his detention.  The filing states:  ""...the US had recently become aware of additional thefts of bitcoins from Secret Service accounts, the facts of which led the government to believe that Bridges, working with others, was also involved in these thefts.""  Bridges is also seeking to unseal the search and seizure warrants used during his arrest in January, court documents show. The government wants to prevent that action, citing the existence of suspected co-conspirators of Bridges.  Disclosure of the warrants, the government said in a 22nd February court filing, ""could jeopardize the new investigation by alerting additional targets of the investigation"".  The news marks the latest development in a case that has already seen high-profile twists and turns, including the revelation that a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent committed improprieties when investigating Silk Road.  Convicted Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht has separately launched an appeal, arguing that the government committed various abuses in conjunction with the investigation and trial.

42398906,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhI8j,1456340140,Former Bitcoin Insurance Advisor Accused of Securities Fraud,"More than a year ago, an effort began to offer insurance products to companies in the bitcoin space – an intriguing idea at the time given the infancy of the industry and the inability of startups to secure this protection for user funds.  The initiative marked some key early successes – security startup BitGo and wallet service Xapo would go on to acquire insurance by way of those efforts – but at least one of those involved says demand for insurance, particularly bitcoin theft insurance, never fully materialized.  Now, a former president and founder of a business venture dedicated to promoting these insurance products to bitcoin companies is facing serious fraud allegations.  Court documents  obtained by CoinDesk allege that Joseph Donnelly, founder and ex-president of Bitcoin Financial Group borrowed $300,000 from Raymond and Suzanne DeBiasa of New Jersey in 2008 to invest the money, but failed to repay the funds.  Instead, it is alleged, Donnelly, along with another individual named Ahuby Donnelly, diverted to funds for personal use – and as a means of funding for Bitcoin Financial Group in the venture’s infancy.  Allegations raised  Bitcoin Financial Group is named as one of the four defendants in the suit, along with the Donnellys and Dovetail Capital. The firm, led by Innovation Insurance Group founder Ty Sagalow, has denied any involvement with the alleged fraud.  Sagalow told CoinDesk that Joseph Donnelly left in December of last year to pursue other business activities after the venture failed to gain significant traction in the industry.  Further, he said that Donnelly never invested any of his own money into the bitcoin insurance venture, and has called the contention that Bitcoin Financial Group is somehow connected to the alleged crimes ""unfounded"".  When reached, attorney Jason Spiro, who is representing the plaintiffs in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, reiterated the suit's claim that his clients were promised proceeds from the revenues of Bitcoin Financial Group.  He told CoinDesk:  ""BitCoin Financial identified Joe Donnelly as its president and co-founder, Donnelly told investors they would be repaid out of BitCoin Financial deals, but tellingly BitCoin Financial has now removed all traces of Joe Donnelly.""  Donnelly declined to comment for this story when reached.  Payments problems  The complaint details Donnelly's alleged investment activities prior to his time with Bitcoin Insurance Group.  According to the agreement outlined in the suit, the Donnellys were required to make monthly interest payments, equal to 12% annually, on top of the $300,000 loaned by the DeBiases.  Those payments, the complaint alleges, stopped arriving in the the fall of 2013, and despite an apparent agreement to pay back the funds in installments, the dispute was never resolved.  It was in the spring of last year, according to the complaint, that Joseph Donnelly told the plaintiffs the Dovetail venture was insolvent and that he was unable to pay them out of those assets. Yet he allegedly offered a solution: he could pay them back through the proceeds of Bitcoin Financial Group.  The filing states:  ""As recently as April 2015, Mr Donnelly again asked the DeBiasas for more time to repay their investment, telling them that they would be repaid out of BitCoin Financial’s investment returns.""  According to the complaint, Donnelly told the plaintiffs that ""I’m a partner in a BitCoin company...if we get a couple dozen of these deals, then it’ll pay off (which I believe is in the cards)"", according to the complaint.  Alleged misrepresentation  In addition to alleged securities fraud, the plaintiffs accused Donnelly of misrepresenting himself as a licensed insurance broker.  It is alleged that Donnelly’s apparent lack of licensure resulted in disciplinary action from a former employer, Lincoln Financial Group. According to LinkedIn, Donnelly worked as an agent for Lincoln between 2001 and 2010.  The filing states:  ""Through their investigation into this fraud and based upon conversations with Mr Donnelly’s colleagues, the DeBiasas further learned that Mr Donnelly was not licensed by FINRA to originate [stranger-originated life insurance] policies. In addition, the DeBiasas learned that Lincoln Financial Group had investigated Mr Donnelly for his unlicensed insurance activities and that Lincoln Financial had revoked his permission to produce Lincoln Financial insurance policies.""  Donnelly’s profile on the Bitcoin Financial Group website, previously removed but viewable via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, states that he ""holds his Life and Health insurance licenses as well as having completed FINRA Series 6, 7, 63 and 65 designations.""  Sagalow told CoinDesk that Donnelly had previously indicated that he possessed a license to broker life insurance.

42398913,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhIEd,1456332395,Winklevoss Bitcoin Exchange Gemini Introduces Dynamic Trading Fees,"Gemini, the New York-based bitcoin exchange founded by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has revamped its fee schedule, to encourage an ""active, stable and efficient marketplace"".  The service was launched just over four months ago and, according to a new blog post by president Cameron Winklevoss, has now collected sufficient data to determine the best fee strategy going forwards.  Winklevoss writes:  ""We have decided to adjust our existing flat fee schedule to a real-time, dynamic maker-taker fee schedule.""  Adopting the maker-taker fee system is aimed to encourage 'makers', who add liquidity to the exchange, which offers a BTC/USD market aimed at institutional investors.  Cameron Winklevoss explained that because liquidity-making orders do not fill immediately and they bear more market risk, the company ""believes in offering greater incentives to makers"".  To kick off the promotion, the new schedule will be available to all Gemini users for 30 days, during which traders will receive a 0.15% rebate on all liquidity-making trades and be charged 0.15% on all liquidity-taking trades.  The new fee schedule is open to all customers from 15:30 BST on 1st March to 15:30 BST on 31st March.  Fee concerns  The announcement follows comments from bitcoin traders that Gemini's original pricing model, charging both buyers and sellers on each trade, could prove an issue that will drive away retail traders – a group that could be essential for building liquidity.  Top bitcoin exchanges around the world offer greater liquidity than Gemini can yet offer, meaning traders on those exchanges are able to cash in and out of the market more quickly, a much more active market participants argued at the time, for profit-making.  One aspect that came under repeated criticism was the exchange's plan to charge 25 basis points (0.25%) to the buyer and seller on each side of any trade.  With today's announcement, Gemini seems to have taken these criticisms on board and is now offering a sliding scale of fees, and even rebates for liquidity makers (see table below).  Liquidity takers will pay fees of 25 bps but can be discounted to 15 bps under certain conditions (see the blog post for the full details).  The post notes that fees and rebates will be based on gross trading volume and the liquidity-making buy/sell ratio over the previous 30-day window.  Further, individual fee rates for traders will be reassessed every 24 hours and adjusted accordingly.

42398912,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhIFc,1456328406,7 Cool Decentralized Apps Being Built on Ethereum,"Imagine a company or service that isn't controlled by any single individual, board or other central entity.  Known as a decentralized application, or 'dapp' for short, the concept has been one of the more novel ideas to emerge from the blockchain community. Armed with self-executing smart contracts, proponents of the technology have envisioned ways to replace everything that today requires a centralized leadership, from businesses and services to governments.  In some ways, bitcoin could be considered the first dapp, as it is fully open-source, rewards contributors, runs without a central authority and uses blockchain technology to help facilitate its continued use case as an online currency.  Next-generation innovators are now seeking to apply these same principles to a variety of online services they believe could be built in the dapp format, armed with a little effort, know-how and the will to charge forward into the unknown.  Although a new field, dapps are growing in number and many now exist in various stages of completeness, from concept to working prototype and functional platform.  Ethereum  's decentralised blockchain and its native digital currency Ether are proving perhaps the most widely used tools for dapp building, as its network is specifically built for the purpose and the Ethereum Foundation, its trade organization overseeing development, runs regular 'hackathon' events to promote new decentralized applications.  But what can you do with a dapp?  For this feature, CoinDesk casts its eye over the current offerings and picks out seven of the more interesting projects being developed using the Ethereum blockchain.  Enriching the web  The Vevue project promises to ""bring Google Street View to life"", by enabling users to take 30-second video clips of restaurants, hotels, places, events and more to share with other around the world.  All users need is a smartphone, and by answering requests pinned in their neighbourhood they can earn bitcoin or even Vevue equity tokens in selected areas.  Furthermore, with the project's Google Chrome extension, 'Vevues' are available when browsers use Google Maps to search local businesses.  The ""Make Videos, Earn Bitcoin"" app is already available on the Google Play store, though is not in its final state and does not currently reward users.  Building virtual worlds  Etheria  is a Minecraft-like virtual world in which players can own tiles, 'farm' them for blocks and build things.  According to the project website, the ""entire state of the world is held in and all player actions are made through the decentralized, trustless Ethereum blockchain"".  Until now, it points out, all virtual worlds have been controlled by a single entity. All aspects of Etheria, on the other hand, are ""agreed to"" by the participants of the Ethereum network without central authority.  This means Etheria cannot be censored or taken down by the government, by its ""owner-players"" or even by the developer, 'fivedogit'. In effect, it will exist as long as Ethereum does.  Managing identity  In the digital age, the increasing risk of financial crime arising from fraud and identity theft demonstrates the importance of a reliable means to safeguard the individual's identity.  To that end, KYC-Chain aims to provide consensus on the identity of individuals at the ""highest level of trust"".  The service, which is currently under construction, utilises existing know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, and plans to bring ""ease and simplicity"" to the process of identification for businesses wishing to onboard new customers.  The platform's ""identity wallets"" will allow users to share only the information necessary, and nothing more.  KYC-Chain employs Ethereum and will work primarily via the use of ""trusted gatekeepers"", who can be any individual or legal entity permitted by law to authenticate KYC documents – for example, notary publics, people of diplomatic status, lawyers, governments, and so on.  A trusted gatekeeper would perform an individual check on a user’s ID using KYC-Chain's platform and authenticate them. The files would be stored in a distributed database system, which can later be retrieved by the trusted gatekeeper, or the user, to demonstrate with certainty that the ID is genuine.  Helping developing businesses  4G Capital  provides instant access to credit for small business growth in Africa, and has developed a concept dapp for the use of smart contracts.  Donors would be able to use the dapp to fund small businesses in Kenya using digital currency. The money lent would be converted and disbursed to the businesses using 4G Capital's transactional system.  Its vision is to empower individuals, businesses and markets by delivering financial inclusion and supporting change across Africa from the grass roots level.  As well as providing 100% unsecured debt funding to self-employed informal market traders, the project provides micro-consulting and business training to increase customer skill levels and business knowledge.  Micro-blogging  Currently a working prototype, Eth-Tweet is a decentralised microblogging service running on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides basic Twitter-like functionality to tweet messages of up to 160 characters.  Being decentralised means no central entity controls what is being published, and once a message is posted, it can only be removed by the publisher.  Further, accounts can receive donations in Ether, which the team suggests can be an incentive to run provide content via the platform.  Empowering artists  Ampliative Arthttp://www.ampliativeart.org/en/welcome  aims to enhance the conditions and prospects of artists via a social network-like platform.  When complete, it will be a reciprocity-based web platform with which individuals can contribute to the art community and be rewarded through ""alternative means"".  Artists will be able to create their own galleries and exhibit their works for free, and both users and artists can be rewarded through tips and donations, comments and reviews, share or exchange proposals. The more a user contributes to the community, the more the community is likely to reward them.  Any revenues earned by the organization will be distributed according the ""reputations"" of the users, the website states.  As a dapp, Ampliative Art will be a transparent cooperative in which users would collaborate, receive rewards and take part in the decision making process.  Crowdfunding  WeiFund  uses Web 3.0-enabled technology to provide a crowdfunding solution on the Ethereum ecosystem.  The project says that since it will be one of many crowdfunding platforms on Web 3.0, it aims to stimulate these platforms by providing ""world-class open-source modular and extensible"" crowdfunding utilities that everyone can access. All critical aspects of the platform are completely decentralized.  To use WeiFund, users will first open WeiFund in a Web 3.0 enabled browser such as Ethereum's Mist. From there they can then start, contribute to, browse and manage crowdfunding campaigns.  WeiFund's interface and user experience will be very similar to that of conventional crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe, however, all funds raised on WeiFund will be accounted for in the Ether digital currency.  Unlike conventional crowdfunding services like Kickstarter, though, WeiFund uses smart contracts, which means donations can actually be turned into complex agreements. This gives campaign operators a ""broader range of possibilities ""when raising funds, the project says.  Further, Web 3.0-enabled browsers will come with their own wallet systems, so that payments made on WeiFund to start and contribute to campaigns are carried out in a ""secure and verifiable way"".

42398930,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhHzs,1456311484,PwC Director: Blockchain Impact Could Create Winners and Losers,"Global professional services giant PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) became the latest big-name firm to make its blockchain service offerings public this month, unveiling a solution portfolio designed to take business clients from ideation to iteration as they explore the emerging technology.  The PwC Blockchain Solution Portfolio, a suite of 12 services aimed at spanning the cycle of analysis ongoing at major financial firms, features elements focused on education, evaluation and, ultimately, fostering collaboration between PwC clients and industry partners.  Further, the scope of the offering is notable as its debut comes amid increasing competition among major professional services firms including Deloitte, Ernst & Young and KPMG – all of whom are seeking to provide services to the growing blockchain market.  In interview, PwC FinTech director Jeremy Drane expanded on PwC’s new offering, explaining how it is geared to help companies understand the size and scope of what could be the coming disruption in financial services resulting from blockchain’s impact.  Drane sought to position PwC as unique among its competitors for its ability to help clients analyze their business processes so both can understand the potential of the technology and innovate in step with the market.  Drane told CoinDesk:  ""If this is disruptive tech, that means there are going to be winners and losers. Certain people in the value chain are going to be made redundant.""  The portfolio, PwC has said, was compiled based on two years of internal research, and according to Drane, this research has been built into DeNovo, a database of 1,000 bitcoin and blockchain service providers that aims to help with the client education process.  Drane described the service as valuable in this environment given what he called the ""significant hype"" and ""lack of substance"" displayed by some ecosystem providers, and positioned PwC as a necessary guide for corporates seeking to investigate the industry.  PwC’s conclusion, Drane said, is that there are only a small number of industry companies that can deliver solutions built on the technology.  ""When you strip away the hype, the industry is not nearly as diverse as you would want,"" Drane said.  The interview follows a notable run of announcements from PwC, which has recently revealed partnerships with industry startups like Blockstream, Digital Asset Holdings and Eris Industries.  Strategic advantage  Given the current climate, Drane described PwC’s industry partnerships as a key value-add for the Blockchain Solution Portfolio.  Drane said that, as a result, PwC will be able to engage its technology partners on behalf of its clients, which in turn, would allow PwC to better craft the front-end, middleware and rapid prototyping solutions offered in its portfolio.  ""You have a direct link to the leaders of these companies and that’s important. These companies have been inundated with companies that want to do things and you have to make sure you’re toward the top in terms of priority,"" Drane said.  He likewise framed Blockstream, Digital Asset Holdings and Eris as companies that provide PwC with the ability to fully span the offerings available in today’s blockchain market. Each, he said, serves a ""specific purpose"" in terms of how their services enhance its overall portfolio.  For example, whereas he described Eris as the ""Swiss army knife of the blockchain"", he lauded Blockstream for its staff featuring many of the bitcoin ecosystem’s top developers.  ""[Blockstream] wants to build, so when you’re dealing with a Blockstream engagement, they bring all the years working on bitcoin. From that standpoint, they might take on much of the heavy lifting and we might do integration, security and user experience [via collaborations],"" he said.  By comparison, Digital Asset Holdings, he said, is more focused on financial services innovation and tackling problems for existing incumbents, and can help clients on these points more effectively than other partners.  Still, Drane said the partnerships are evidence of PwC’s intent to avoid competing with innovators in the blockchain industry.  ""We could have created a PwC-branded blockchain suite, but that kind of approach feels like, to the startups, that we would have ended up competing with them,"" Drane said, adding:  ""We wanted to ensure the way we constructed our offering to help develop the ecosystem.""  Interoperability concerns  Yet another question facing financial firms developing blockchain PoCs is whether the tech will be interoperable in the long term given the differing consensus algorithms used by blockchain technology providers.  Prospective PwC clients, for example, may be initially uncertain whether to build on open public networks like the bitcoin blockchain, more permissioned alternatives like Ripple, or whether they are in need of a custom solution. Further, a range of startup providers have emerged, each with its own thesis on how this evolution is likely to occur.  Complicating development is that PwC does not believe there will be one blockchain or consensus system that dominates the market, Drane said. Rather, he said, certain processes will gravitate to public blockchains, while others are likely to be created on private systems, depending on need.  Recognizing the potential complications, Drane called interoperability a ""huge"" question facing the industry, but one that spoke to the core competencies of its partner Blockstream. Fresh off $55m in Series A funding, Blockstream is seeking to develop a project called sidechains that is designed to allow digital assets to move between blockchains.  Drane said that the interoperability question will be key to financial auditors, who will be tasked with needing to understand the impact transactions between blockchain-based systems.  ""Imagine it’s 1st January and a digital asset is on an Ethereum blockchain. Then, imagine it’s sitting on a Tendermint blockchain on 31st March. As an auditor, what does that mean?"" Drane asked.  Drane said that provenance, or the chain of custody of the asset, will become important as auditors seek to understand how digital assets move, and what that means for their clients.  ""We can’t do our jobs if this interoperability issue isn’t front and center,"" Drane said. ""It's fundamental to a world where you have digital assets.""  Market obstacles  As for whether he believes the blockchain PoCs being developed at PwC will see the market in 2016, Drane was less clear.  Drane said that, in his opinion, the business elements of financial companies may not be fully equipped to understand the profit-and-loss (P&L) impact of launching blockchain-based services, which may hold back their ability to meet internal approvals.  ""At the end of the day, as much as they want to take something an innovation team has built, there are so many checks and balances, whether it's risk management, regulation or having a business person sign off, those things just have not been done,"" Drane said.  Increasingly, Drane said, he sees the technology being held back by a lack of development in other internal processes at financial firms.  ""It's not a technology thing, we’re getting good. We are getting good on a technology question. It's a strategy and business question, and tucked into those things are risk management and regulation,"" he explained.  In this light, Drane sees blockchain moving more slowly to market, with firms seeking to leverage it for internal processes being the most obvious first-movers, and that the technology providers who can ease this process may be the early winners.  Drane also explained that PwC is working on implementations of blockchain tech for its own processes, but declined to comment further.  Elsewhere, he sought to position the transition that would be brought on by the technology as one that would take years, concluding:  ""I think you’re going to see some [internal applications] start to move into scale. But, if you’re talking about the restructuring of clearing and settlement, that’s going to take a long time.""
