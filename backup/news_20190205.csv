42381495,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9mycl,1549400444,LedgerX Unveils Betting Market for 2020's Bitcoin Block Reward Halving,"The bitcoin block reward will be cut in half next year – and soon, market watchers can place bets on exactly when the subsidy halving will happen.  According to one estimated date, the halving will occur in late May 2020, but the precise time could shift slightly depending on the pace of blocks on the network and factors such as variance and miner luck. While not exact at this point in time, LedgerX is giving those who analyze the network a means to bet on when the halving will occur.  In a blog post announcing the new product, LedgerX contended that such an offering presents a particularly effective hedging instrument for bitcoin miners, explaining:  ""Bitcoin is unique in that there is a fundamental economic risk that is binary. To give an analogy, imagine you are an oil producer such as Exxon Mobile and know that one day in 2020, the number of barrels of oil you extract will go down by half, forever. But you’re not certain which date that will be. This would materially impact planning for investment and operations.""  For those unfamiliar with this particular nuance of the bitcoin network, each block receives a reward in bitcoin to the miner who successfully creates it. The reward began at 50 BTC per block, and that reward cuts in half every 210,000 blocks. With two prior halvings, the reward is currently 12.5 BTC per block, and is set to fall to just 6.25 BTC per block.  The central question posed by LedgerX's new product is this: when will block number 630,000 be forever stamped onto the blockchain?  Through the firm, participants can buy contracts that set a specific time that the halving will occur. If it happens after that time, they won't pay out.  To begin with, LedgerX will offer five different contracts, ranging from March 27 (the riskiest, so it should have the lowest price) to July 31 (the safest, so it should have the highest). The date the contracts will begin selling and trading remains to be determined, but LedgerX expects it will be this quarter.  Opening day will be determined by client interest, and more dates could be offered for more precise bets depending on market interest. LedgerX will make a small fee on each contract, the price of which remains to be determined.  Just a bet?  Any of LedgerX's institutional clients will be able to participate in these contracts, but CEO Paul Chou argues that the offering provides a larger service to the industry than just another way to put money on the line.  ""Even if you do not trade the contract directly, we are offering the prices the market has for free to everyone,"" he told CoinDesk in an email.  Effectively, the contracts crowdsource information about when the halving will occur, giving market participants with information an incentive to share that indirectly in the form of bets that will move market prices. Anyone can see the market consensus date for the halving in real-time.  ""It's similar to other commodity markets where, when you are planning on how many people, resources and infrastructure you want for the next year, you can view derivatives markets to see how profitable people are expecting it to be,"" Chou wrote.  Mining is a narrow-margin business, and the halving will undoubtedly cause any number of operations to shut down. The day it occurs ""makes a huge impact,"" Chou wrote us in an email. ""If someone got really lucky and found a ton of blocks over the next two months a lot of miners would go out of business sooner than expected.""  If a miner's decision to buy new equipment or take on a lease depended on just how long the current block reward might hold, a miner could hedge the risk of the tail end of that capital investment using these contracts, Chou explained.

According to a report published Tuesday, zcash cryptographer Ariel Gabizon discovered a ""subtle"" bug a little less than a year ago in zk-SNARKS, the bleeding-edge cryptography the cryptocurrency uses to shield balances and user identities, which are implemented so that outsiders can't see financial information users want kept to themselves.  Once the zcash team found out about the bug, they kept it quiet and pulled together a fix, which they then added to zcash's large Sapling upgrade, which was executed October last year. Today, though, is the first time the company has revealed it to the larger public.  If exploited, an attacker would have been able to print an infinite amount of zcash tokens.  The blog post, written by zcash marketing director Josh Swihart, director of product security Benjamin Winston, and engineer Sean Bowe, explained:  ""Prior to its remediation, an attacker could have created fake Zcash without being detected. The counterfeiting vulnerability has been fully remediated in Zcash and no action is required by Zcash users.""  Because zk-SNARKs are so bleeding-edge, some have criticized zcash for using the technology so early on. (It's so early stage that zcash is the largest implementation that uses the cryptography so far.) Plus, due to the nature of the privacy technology, which shields data, it's difficult to know for sure whether tokens have been counterfeited.  Still, the team added that they don't think zcash was at risk of the counterfeiting bug for a number of reasons, including ""discovery of the vulnerability would have required a high level of technical and cryptographic sophistication that very few people possess.""  And indeed, some have applauded the team's handling of the bug – including famed NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.  ""A lot of people wonder why I like #Zcash despite the Founder's Reward. Here's a reason: that tax funds a quality team that catches and kills serious bugs in-house, before they get exploited,"" he tweeted.

Although his company plans to continue operating nodes for their own records, OriginalMy is an anomaly in that it has paying clients like the Brazilian Fintech Association that might require quick queries. Junior said OriginalMy earned $60,000 from such clients in 2018 and is currently participating in the first Ethereum Classic Labs startup accelerator program in San Francisco, which concludes with a demo day in April 2019.  According to Yaz Khoury, director of developer relations at the nonprofit ETC Cooperative, Google’s staff took note of this increased focus on fostering use cases.  “They approached me,” Khoury said of Google, adding that BigQuery support is about “merging the gap between people who are very familiar with the blockchain data structure” and technologists who are more familiar with querying other types of data.  Khoury is already using BigQuery to map out ETC ownership distribution beyond exchanges and the two millionaires who helped grow the ethereum spinoff, ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert (full disclosure, DCG is CoinDesk's parent company).  Now that Khoury said people can search for ETC blockchain data across all of Google Cloud’s BigQuery products – and that hopefully, less-crypto-savvy technologists will experiment on their own as well.  Despite its nascent user base, this Google support comes at a fortuitous time for the ETC community. ETC Labs, funded by the parent company Digital Finance Group, invested $100,000 in six of the projects participating in the inaugural class of the accelerator program.  Kickstarting incubation  OriginalMy previously participated in Google’s Startup Residency Program in 2017. And if the current ETC Labs accelerator goes well, there may soon be other ETC-centric startups with enough user traction to warrant additional invitations for like-minded projects.  ETC Labs director Elizabeth Kukka told CoinDesk the accelerator's first batch teams of range from pre-seed projects to full-fledged startups seeking Series A rounds. She says the first class of projects is comparable to the more robust ethereum ecosystem fostered by ConsenSys Ventures and its Tachyon incubator program.  The Ethereum Foundationhttps://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-foundation-donates-150000-to-ethereum-classic-the-duo-patches-up/ itself, headed by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, has been known to donate to the ETC cooperative, promoting synergy between these ecosystems. However, in addition to cross-industry partnerships, the ETC community wants to establish a support system of its own.  As ETC Labs marketing director Dean Pappas put it, the lab aims to join the blockchain research startup IOHK, which is headed by ethereum classic co-founder Hoskinson, as an institutional partner for the community. The lab now employs roughly nine developers focusing on the ETC blockchain, comparable to the way bitcoin-centric firms like Chaincode Labs and Blockstream devote developer resources to purely open-source work.  “Just like we see Blockstream informing most of bitcoin’s development,” Pappas said. “We see ETC Labs trying to be that.”  Pappas added that ETC-centric startups are going to be able to grow faster now that they have a direct line of communication to ETC core developers.  “We think that this cooperation will lead to faster deployment,” Pappas said.

42402586,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdXgug,1549388747,Winklevoss Exchange Gemini Shuts Down Accounts Over Stablecoin Redemptions,"Two over-the-counter trading desks say their accounts at Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by U.S. investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, were abruptly closed without explanation over attempts to redeem GUSD, the company’s stablecoin first introduced in September.  The claims leveled against Gemini by the OTC desks, relayed under anonymity due to fears of reputational damage, hint at the business practices developing within the stablecoin market itself, now estimated to be worth nearly $3 billion.  In one instance, email correspondence obtained by CoinDesk shows an OTC trader based in Latin America had his account closed after he informed Gemini that he planned to redeem several million dollars of GUSD. (A major cryptocurrency exchange, speaking on condition of anonymity, attested to the desk’s professionalism and reported that it was in good standing.)  Still, Gemini said in a statement to the trader that a review “determined [the] account must be closed” and that it was “not able to elaborate on the specifics for this decision.”  When contacted by CoinDesk, Gemini declined to comment on the incidents.  However, the actions may hint at how measures taken by Gemini to boost GUSD adoption have had unintended impacts in practice. In a bid to capture market share, Gemini issued roughly 1 percent discounts on GUSD in 2018 to OTC desks and market makers, who were then made to agree on restrictions that would bar them from immediately redeeming the assets.  According to the trader based in Latin America, Gemini pitched the company on a discount deal that offered his firm the ability to buy tokens at below market value. (The company declined because the desk wanted to obtain GUSD so that it could be transferred to fiat.)  When the desk later acquired GUSD from its own network, the trader said he was warned by Gemini staff that redeeming millions of dollars would harm the stablecoin.  In another instance, a U.S.-based OTC desk told CoinDesk its Gemini account was promptly shut after redeeming several million GUSD. He now believes this was part of Gemini’s strategy to “maximize their status on CoinMarketCap.”  The trader provided emails to CoinDesk that show how Gemini closed the account without offering any reason, days after the desk redeemed GUSD.  These issues are so widely known that an OTC desk with an active Gemini account told CoinDesk he’s reluctant to redeem GUSD for fear of jeopardizing his account.  The trader told CoinDesk:  “So many players are unable to redeem, even very, very big OTC desks. Having an account doesn’t guarantee redeemability.”  Iced out  The fact that cryptocurrency traders are frustrated with Gemini’s offering is perhaps nothing new, as the exchange isn’t shy about its preference for institutional Wall Street traders, even launching a pricey ad campaign this year to promote itself as a “regulated exchange.”  In response to inquiries about such claims, Gemini submitted the following statement:  “Gemini is a New York trust company. As a result, some potential customers will be unable or unwilling to pass our robust compliance program. This is a feature, not a bug, and what makes Gemini different. We understand this may frustrate some, but this is necessary to build trust in the future of money.”  Gemini told CoinDesk the company has redeemed more than $133 million worth of GUSD, over half the supply created so far, with clients redeeming up to $40 million at a time.  Furthermore, a representative from a proprietary trading firm who uses the Gemini platform to trade and redeem GUSD, who asked to stay anonymous in order to avoid revealing which exchanges he uses, told CoinDesk the criticism lobbied by OTC traders may be influenced by competition rather than a lack of utility.  “They [Gemini] are not loved like other people, so I think that some of that is being transferred onto their product,” he said.  Still, other active companies in the market report that the level of restrictions on Gemini’s accounts exceed industry norms.  A third OTC desk told CoinDesk it was denied access to a Gemini account because it was allegedly offering a competing money-services business, despite the fact it believes it adheres to the same compliance principles as regional competitors that trade on Gemini.  Seeking demand  In some ways, OTC desks do directly compete with exchange platforms like Gemini. However, external context supports the notion that there may not be much organic demand for GUSD among professional traders.  Indeed, five unaffiliated OTC desks all told CoinDesk there was no demand for GUSD among their trading networks. OTC traders said it appears a high percentage of perceived GUSD trading activity is concentrated on exchanges that they do not use.  “The trading volume is dictated by [Gemini’s] actions and has nothing to do with the market, per se,” said one anonymous OTC trader who has worked with GUSD.  According to CoinMarketCap, the exchanges with the highest GUSD trading volume include OEX, Hotbit, Bitrue and Fatbtc. Gemini has no direct association with these exchanges.  In particular, OEX and Fatbtc are both ranked on the Blockchain Transparency Institutes’ advisory list. The nonprofit estimated that over 98 percent of those exchanges’ activity comes from automated trades, which typically involves bots rather than real users.  BloomX OTC desk founder Luis Buenaventura, whose desk is based in the Philippines, told CoinDesk there are fewer liquidity concerns related to GUSD’s rival, PAX, a dollar-pegged asset issued by the exchange Paxos, suggesting the trouble isn’t inherent to all heavily regulated stablecoins.  Yet, overall, Buenaventura still said his partners prefer the less heavily regulated stablecoin Tether because there is “limited liquidity amongst the other stablecoins.”  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/05/winklevoss-exchange-gemini-shuts-down-accounts-over-stablecoin-redemptions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74a5643298eecc69ce28db1ff73445fcf37c266c-1500x825.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402589,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdXgxd,1549384559,Judge Moves to Block Potential Lawsuits Against QuadrigaCX Exchange,"A judge in Canada will rule in favor of a creditor protection request filed last week by Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, issuing a 30-day stay of proceedings.  The controversial platform went offline last week, later announcing that it was filing for protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) due to its inability to locate its ""significant cryptocurrency reserves,"" which may total as much as $137 million (in U.S. dollars). The company sought to preempt any litigation from customers hoping to recoup their losses, according to the filing.  Tuesday's outcome was expected, as financial crimes attorney Christine Duhaime previously explained. She told CoinDesk Monday that she anticipated the exchange would receive the protection, and that professional services firm EY would be appointed as a monitor to oversee Quadriga's processes and procedures over the next several months.  Indeed, EY was appointed as a monitor for the exchange, tasked with helping it locate any assets that can be quickly recovered or sold off to begin reimbursing anywhere from 90,000 to 115,000 customers who had funds locked up in the exchange.  Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Wood, who is overseeing the case, stated:  ""I'm satisfied that the order under the CCAA ought to be issued today.""  ""I’m going to issue the order effective today,"" he later added.  Wood had a few ""drafting questions"" remaining before finishing the formal order, he said.  Attorneys for the applicants, which include QuadrigaCX and EY, now have five days to serve the 115,000 customers owed funds with notice of the order.  Initially, EY will handle communications, an attorney explained.  Cash-flow concerns  The bulk of Quadriga's missing funds are said to be in cold wallets, offline storage commonly used as a security precaution against hacks and thefts. When the exchange's founder and CEO Gerald Cotten died of Crohn's disease in December, he reportedly took all knowledge of the exchange's private keys with him.  An initial EY filing said the company would have to focus on determining whether there are any reserves in cold storage, and how to access them. On Tuesday, a representative for the firm explained that the company would set up a wallet to store any coins that are recovered.  While Cotten's widow, Jennifer Robertson, has already hired one security expert to try and crack an encrypted laptop Cotten reportedly worked off of, an attorney for Quadriga explained that it was being moved to his office and would be sent on to EY.  ""We still think there is a significant amount of cryptocurrency, totaling up to $180 million [CAD] floating around out there that we haven’t found,"" he said.  It remains unclear how successful the company may be at locating Quadriga's reserves.  Maurice Chiasson, a partner with Canadian law firm Stewart McKelvey, also noted that payment processors hold some significant amount of Quadriga's funds, primarily in the form of cash and cash equivalents. Chiasson is representing QuadrigaCX at present.  These payment processors do not have bank accounts, largely because banking institutions are hesitant to work with cryptocurrency companies, he said.  One processor, Billerfy, has some $25 million [CAD] in its possession, but because the company has no bank account, it cannot cash out bank drafts.  Another processor maintains about $5 million, he added.  ""There is a need for some sort of process. Is there something under the broad remedial powers of the [CCAA] that provides a solution. No one's disputing ... that a significant chunk of this belongs to Quadriga and they just can't access it,"" Chiasson said. ""Those funds will be of tremendous importance.""  Contentious hearing  During testimony, Wood pushed back on a number of aspects of the affidavit filed by Quadriga, asking for clarification on certain points and highlighting certain flaws that he saw on others.  His first major point of contention revolved around notice issued to creditors and stakeholders. As Chiasson explained, due to the ""urgent"" nature of the filing, notice was not provided to the majority of creditors, though he added that a note was published to the exchange's website and internet forums shared information about the filing shortly thereafter.  Wood noted that issuing a stay of proceedings order without creditors receiving formal notice was typically not granted, ""even under CCAA filings. This is a very unusual request.""  However, attorneys claiming to represent potential creditors said they did not oppose the order, clearing the way for Tuesday's approval.  The Justice also took issue with an early argument made by Chaisson, which indicated that his firm may maintain a wallet to store recovered coins. Wood pointed out that this may present a conflict for Chaisson or his firm by making them active participants in the proceedings. EY's decision to maintain the wallet resolved this.  Still, other arguments pertained strictly to the written word.

42402595,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdXh4W,1549383048,Government Death Certificate Says QuadrigaCX CEO Died in India,"An Indian government-issued death certificate obtained by CoinDesk corroborates QuadrigaCX's account of the passing of CEO Gerald Cotten in early December.  Cotten’s death is at the center of the turmoil surrounding the Canada-based crypto exchange, which went offline last week owing $190 million to its thousands of customers and is now seeking creditor protection in a Novia Scotia court.  Some customers and observers have expressed skepticism about reports of Cotten's death, given that QuadrigaCX took more than a month to disclose it, that the disclosure followed a long period of fiat and crypto withdrawal delays, and that the company did not provide documentation of his passing.  But the death certificate, issued by the Government of Rajasthan’s Directorate of Economics and Statistics and obtained from a source involved in the events, indicates that Cotten died on Dec. 9 – the same date given in a Dec. 12 statement of death from a Halifax funeral home filed in the Nova Scotia court by his wife, Jennifer Robertson.  The death certificate, issued on Dec. 13, identifies him as “Gerald William Cottan” and names Robertson as his wife.  QuadrigaCX said in mid-January that Cotten had died while traveling in India due to complications from Crohn’s disease. At the time, Global Affairs Canada – the government agency that manages diplomatic relations – seemed to confirm Cotten’s death, but only in vague terms.  Then came last week's revelation that QuadrigaCX owes more than $100 million worth of cryptocurrency to its customers but is unable to repay because Cotten had sole control of the private keys connected to those funds. Robertson said in court filings that while she is in possession of Cotten’s laptop, it is encrypted and is currently inaccessible.  Amid the turmoil and uncertainty, various theories – including speculation that he had faked his death and fled with the exchange’s funds – have floated around on social media. Yet the Rajasthan document is the strongest evidence yet for QuadrigaCX's story, having been obtained from the government office responsible for tracking such information. The document identifies Fortis Escorts Hospital, in the city of Jaipur, as the place of death.  As of press time, Fortis Escorts Hospital could not be reached for comment.

That's the thesis of Dharma Labs, which built the Dharma protocol for decentralized lending businesses. Its first product, Dharma Lever, is in a closed alpha release now, enabling loans for traders and large crypto holders.  Now the startup has secured $7 million to build out the product in a round led by Green Visor Capital, a fintech-focused venture capital firm. Other participants include Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Y Combinator, Passport Capital, Blockchange and Ripple's Xpring fund.  Dharma CEO Nadav Hollander said in statement:  ""In the same way that Uber made it both easy and cheap to get a ride from anywhere in the world, we believe Dharma Lever will make accessing margin lending easy and cheap for anyone in the world.""  Dharma Lever's website promises a few advantages over the existing solutions for credit in crypto, a service that is expected to be primarily used for traders to make investments on margin. It works directly from a trader's wallet, without the need for a special extension.  Loans are all made trustlessly, governed by smart contracts. Dharma Lever also promises better loan rates over those offered on exchanges.  ""Without a central point of failure, Dharma’s financial services simply ‘can’t be evil,’"" the company said, with a wink toward Google.  The company plans to use the investment to expand its engineering and growth teams, according to a statement.  Growing ecosystem  The gold rush has gotten a lot slower, but more shovel shops are opening.  There's been a slew of new companies emerging to offer crypto versions of existing, well-established financial products. For example, Compound is building a money market for crypto. Paradigm is building a decentralized order book. Caspian is building a more sophisticated backend for crypto trading and investment operations.  This increasing robustness could be key. Research out of the University of Queensland suggested that crypto lacks the adequate liquidity to find accurate prices.  Indeed, Mike Walsh, general partner at Green Visor, said in a press release:  ""In an industry where economies are natively digital, we believe Dharma's technology will become a necessary piece of infrastructure for future growth.""  Fellow-investor Coinbase Ventures echoed that sentiment. Emilie Choi, the Coinbase VP who runs the ventures arm, told CoinDesk:  ""Dharma’s lending product makes it easy for developers and people to create loans that are trustless and managed on-chain. We view companies like Dharma, and their Lever product, as a sign that the crypto ecosystem is maturing, and an important step on the path to a more open financial system.""  Noting that Hollander, Dharma's founder, is a former Coinbase engineering intern, Choi added, ""We’re proud to support our alumni as they progress in their crypto careers and make new and novel contributions to crypto.""  Update (Feb. 5, 18:05 UTC): Blockchange and Ripple's Xpring fund were also involved in the funding round.  Zack Seward contributed reporting.

Since it was founded six years ago, Huobi Group has come to dominate several global crypto exchange markets, thanks in part to its popularity among deep-pocketed Chinese traders. According to company officials, Huobi Group has managed $1 trillion in accumulative turnover, or annual net sales.  Now the U.S.-based sister exchange HBUS – a separate entity primarily funded by Huobi Global CEO Leon Li – is leveraging its global network for an unprecedented push into North America that's beginning with a partnership with Prime Trust, a Nevada trust company, that will provide fiat deposit and withdrawal services for its exchange users.  As part of the effort, Huobi.com will now allow USD-to-crypto trading for bitcoin, ethereum and the dollar-pegged stablecoin tether, with a $100 minimum.  “Huobi's launch is very exciting,” Prime Trust CEO Scott Purcell told CoinDesk. “They are a great company and we are thrilled to work with them.”  HBUS CEO Frank Fu told CoinDesk this is only the beginning of HBUS’s U.S. partnerships, with others in the works. Fu said:  “Once we establish partnerships with our institutional clients and put in place the required regulatory and compliance structure, we should be able to offer innovative products and financial services to larger audiences, such as … potential ETFs and derivatives.”  Even if those partnerships don’t pan out, diverse crypto options with fiat liquidity could be a game-changer for HBUS, which Fu said has roughly 60,000 U.S.-based account holders, in addition to a few dozen Chinese users on-boarded through a partnership with Huobi Global.  Speaking to the dozens of cryptocurrencies under consideration beyond the current offerings, which include bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, ethereum classic, bitcoin cash and tether, HBUS’s U.S.-based chief compliance officer, Megan Monroe-Coleman, told CoinDesk:  “We developed a comprehensive due-diligence process to review new token projects. ... We're really excited to increase both the volume of tokens and the uniqueness of those assets.”  Monroe-Coleman says the company documents the process thoroughly to avoid listing “any token projects that could possibly be classified as a security under U.S. securities laws.""  As it gears up to add new trading pairs, HBUS is also busy updating its onboarding process for Chinese users, with features like Chinese-language know-your-customer (KYC) procedures.  “We could be a distribution channel, the gateway connecting the West to the East,” Fu told CoinDesk. “A lot of the U.S. financial products and services are highly regarded, so we want to be able to be able to offer those products and services to our investors globally as we’re able to set up the right compliance processes.”  Compliance challenges  Huobi’s new global asset flows could indirectly give Chinese traders the ability to convert yuan for cryptocurrency through Huobi Global’s OTC desk, then send the cryptocurrency to the U.S.-based exchange to cash out in USD.  Lester Li, Huobi Global’s head of London operations, told CoinDesk he estimates between 50 and 200 of the global platform’s institutional clients are companies run by Chinese founders but based abroad in order to avoid China’s stringent compliance standards and capital controls.  According to Canadian attorney Christine Duhaime, who specializes in anti-money-laundering law and blockchain technologies, China’s regulations forbid its citizens from moving more than $50,000 annually per person, without seeking special permission. She told CoinDesk:  “If you’re a company trying to take out bitcoin, you can take out no amount without getting permission from the government.”  In order to navigate this complex regulatory landscape, HBUS plans to triple its employee count to around 150 in 2019, with an emphasis on compliance and teams focused on institutional partnerships.  Huobi Global already has a banking partner in Australia, Goldfields Money. Fred Schebesta, a major shareholder in Goldfields, told CoinDesk that the institution deals with such China-specific compliance issues by only serving Chinese expats, not current residents subject to Chinese capital controls.  Plus, HBUS’s Monroe-Coleman told CoinDesk that institutional accounts undergo rigorous KYC checks, including all individuals who own more than 25 percent of that entity, in accordance with the Bank Secrecy Act.  HBUS’s partner, Prime Trust, is not itself a bank, but it has previously said it has relationships with FDIC-insured institutions such as U.S. Bank and Pacific Mercantile Bank. (This is clearly a sector Prime Trust intends to expand, given how the trust recently eliminated custody fees for digital assets.)  Separately, Huobi’s OTC desk works with Signature Bank in New York, but the relationship is strictly at the wholesale level, as the institution did not want to handle the exchange’s retail customers, a person familiar with the situation said.  Beyond Chinese users, the U.S.-based exchange aims to be a compliance-centric portal for Huobi Global’s estimated 13 million users worldwide.  “We will start from the U.S. but our vision is to provide a global services platform,” Fu said. “A lot of the U.S. financial products and services are highly regarded, so we want to be able to be able to offer those products and services to our investors globally as we’re able to set up the right compliance processes.”  Ian Allison contributed reporting.

Still in development, the platform – called Stablehouse.io – is aimed to addresses patchy liquidity, stability and accessibility that currently ""prevent the stablecoin market from reaching critical mass,"" according to an announcement.  Stablehouse will act like a traditional central clearing counterparty, or CCP, allowing the exchange of stablecoins at ""a liquid market price and for a fixed minimal fee."" The platform will launch with support for transactions between USDT, GUSD, PAX, TUSD, USDC and DAI, with more options expected to be added moving forward.  The venture is being led by XBTO founder Philippe Bekhazi, who will act as interim CEO for the time being. Its advisory board will include Potter, as well as David Namdar, a founding partner of Galaxy Digital and SolidX Partners; and Samson Mow, chief strategy officer at Blockstream.  Ultimately, the partners say they hope to provide some of the infrastructure required for ""mass adoption"" of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies.  “The stablecoin market at the moment is inefficient and has various disparate stablecoins, with users needing to transact several times with different parties to exchange one stablecoin for another,"" said Bekhazi. “Stablehouse will address this by serving as a centralized platform that gives issuers, holders and exchanges certainty over access and liquidity, creating enhanced confidence for investors, developers and merchants.""  Stablehouse will initially be headquartered in Bermuda, and will seek a digital asset business license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority, according to the announcement.  While the stablecoin use case is growing, Bitfinex and Tether Ltd., which have overlapping management and owners, have suffered something of an image problem for the widely used USDT stablecoin. This culminated late last year when USDT dramatically broke with dollar parity and the exchange rate dropped as low as $0.85. A week later, large amounts of tether were taken out of circulation by Bitfinex.  However, Mow played down the issues telling CoinDesk, ""The image problem for Tether is manufactured. They are probably the most reliable and liquid stablecoin on the market.""

According to Financial Tribune, four Iranian banks – Bank Mellat, Bank Melli Iran, Bank Pasargad and Parsian Bank – have partnered with blockchain startup Kuknos Company for the project.

It was reported in July 2018 that Iran might develop a national crypto as a means to bypass new economic sanctions enacted by U.S. President Donald Trump. The cryptocurrency would back and tokenize Iran’s national fiat currency, the rial, in order to facilitate domestic and cross-border transactions.  Last week, though, the Central Bank of Iran issued a draft report saying that it may seek to block the use of unapproved cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.  Last month, US lawmakers introduced bills against Iran’s efforts to create a sovereign cryptocurrency.  Portions of the Blocking Iran Illicit Finance Act, introduced by Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wisc.), called for an investigation into Iran’s crypto efforts. A corresponding bill was submitted in the Senate by Sen.

The latest bout of consolidation, however, looks more likely to end with a move to the higher side, as the cryptocurrency has created a falling wedge on the daily chart. Further, signs of bearish exhaustion have emerged on the 4-hour chart.  A strong move above $3,430 would confirm a falling wedge breakout and open the doors to $3,658 (the high of the bearish gravestone doji created on Jan. 26).  The bullish case would weaken below the recent low of $3,322.  The current calm in the bitcoin (BTC) market is reminiscent of the lackluster trading witnessed in October.  Bitcoin’s daily trading range, the spread between the highest and lowest prices, fell to $33 yesterday – the lowest since Oct. 31, according to CoinMarketCap data. On that date, the leading cryptocurrency had witnessed a daily trading range of $32.  Back then, BTC was squeezed above $6,300 for four weeks leading up to Nov. 14, when the cryptocurrency dashed hopes of a long-term bullish reversal with a convincing break below the crucial support of $6,000.  The latest bout of sideways trading below $3,500 is just seven days old and was preceded by a gradual sell-off from late December highs above $4,200.  The odds of the consolidation ending with an upside move are high, as the cryptocurrency has charted a falling wedge – a bullish reversal pattern – on the daily chart.  As of writing, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day above $3,420 on Bitstamp.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC is probing the upper edge of the falling wedge, currently at $3,430.  A daily close (UTC) above that level would confirm a wedge breakout and allow a rally to $3,658 – the high of the bearish gravestone doji created on Jan. 26. A violation there would validate the wedge breakout and open up upside toward the psychological hurdle of $4,000.  4-hour chart  As seen above, BTC cleared the lower edge of the channel yesterday in favor of the bears.  Even so, the psychological support of $3,400 continues to hold ground, signaling seller exhaustion. Hence, BTC could well make a falling wedge breakout in the next 24 hours.

42402580,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdXgqk,1549362970,$312 Million in Mt Gox Cryptos Possibly Sold Via BitPoint Exchange,"What appear to be leaked bank documents suggest that millions of dollars-worth of cryptocurrency from the now-bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox may have been sold on the the open market through Japan's BitPoint exchange last year.  Goxdox, a site dedicated to supporting the creditors of Mt. Gox, publishedhttps://www.goxdox.com/ images of bank transactions on Tuesday, stating that they show payments in Japanese yen from BitPoint to the account of the Mt. Gox trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi. The payments amount to 34.3 billion yen (about $312.5 million at today's exchange rate).  The most likely explanation is that the payments represent fiat funds resulting from the sale of bitcoin and bitcoin cash from Mt. Gox, the site concluded, saying:  ""Unless BitPoint is being really generous, we’d wager the reason they are depositing billions JPY into the trustee’s bank account is because they were hired to sell the MtGox Estate's BTC/BCH.""  If indeed he sold the cryptocurrency in this manner, Kobayashi went against the advice of Jesse Powell, the CEO of crypto exchange Kraken, which was hired in 2014 to assist the search for Mt. Gox's missing coins. According to the post, Powell said he had advised the trustee to not sell the cryptocurrency, or to do so via auctions or over-the-counter (OTC) sales to avoid affecting market prices.  “Creditors should demand details on BitPoint's selling methods. The trustee should explain why Kraken's advice was ignored,” Goxdox said. “Instead of taking Kraken’s advice, the trustee decided to (1) sell, (2) not tell us how he sold, and (3) hire a different so-called ‘cryptocurrency expert’ to sell the BTC/BCH.”  The so-called ""dumpening” of the crypto holdings by the trustee may have affected bitcoin prices across last year, the post continues, adding the disclaimer that it is not yet absolutely certain how the coins were sold.  Back in March, Kobayashi denied being the cause of the decline in bitcoin prices since December 2017 with the sale of some $400 million-worth of bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  “Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCC, not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the [greatest] extent possible,” the trustee said at the time, using the alternate ticker symbol BCC for bitcoin cash, which is more normally assigned the symbol BCH.  However, he refrained from disclosing precise details of how the funds were sold.  Mt.

42402594,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdXh3X,1549355125,Bitcoin's 'Lightning Torch' Explained: What It Is and Why It Matters,"The bitcoin community is currently immersed in an experiment called the “lightning torch.""  The effort is intended to show the value of bitcoin's lightning network – an up-and-coming technology that is experimental and hard to use so far, but it does offer improvements over today's most common payment systems by allowing users to pass money around the world quickly and without a third party, unlike Mastercard and Paypal.  And participants are out to show this facet of the technology in a kind of global relay race using an ever-increasing amount of BTC.  By way of the social media platform Twitter, people pass the ""torch payment"" from one person to another, adding 10,000 satoshis (worth about $0.34 at press time) to the payment before sending it further along. Imagine a kind of lightning network-style snowball effect and you get the basic gist of what's happening around the world.  It's been called the ""LN Trust Chain"" since whoever has the torch is supposed to send it on to someone they trust will send the payment on, rather than keep the payment to themselves.  Indeed, developers might still call lightning ""reckless,"" since it's experimental software and users can lose money if they (or the software) makes a wrong move. There's even a Twitter hashtag dedicated to this fact.  But so far, the experiment seems to be having its intended effect, The ""torch"" has attracted the participation of 139 peoplehttps://www.takethetorch.online/Torch in at least 37 countries, according to the pseudonymous torch ringleader, who goes by the name Hodlonaut.  The list of participants includes some notable names in the bitcoin community, such as advocate and Mastering Bitcoin author Andreas Antonopoulos.  ""Heretical thought of the day: Playing #LNtrustchain is better than watching the Superbowl,"" he tweeted after sending the torch to the next participant, adding:  ""Ok, I lied. Anything is better than watching the Superbowl for this geek.""  Thus far, other participants include Morgan Creek Digital founder Anthony Pompliano and Lightning Labs engineer Joost Jager.  Humble beginnings  The torch started on a whim.  On January 19th, Hodlonaut said he would pass on 100,000 satoshis to the first person he trusts. ""How many satoshis until it breaks?"" he tweeted.  ""The reason I started this was just to have some fun with the lightning network and maybe spread more awareness. I thought it would maybe do five or six hops and then die, without many people noticing,"" Hodlonaut told CoinDesk.  But now, of course, it's grown into a worldwide phenomenon as illustrated in the map above, equipped with its own website and an accompanying hashtag.  Not to mention, it's come to mean a lot to its participants.  “The #LNTrustChain showed the world: 1. Lightning works and it's amazing. All of us who've used it in a solo context (buying stickers, playing games, etc) already knew it, but this experiment was the first widespread public demonstration of its power,” saidhttps://www.takethetorch.online/tikawamoto one user.  Antonopoulos told CoinDesk that the torch represents a way to test and uncover problems with the technology. And it's not quite as easy to participate as it sounds: setting up a lightning node is a hard enough task, but there are other tricky factors as well.  ""To be able to 'play', your [lightning network] node must be well connected, with enough capacity and well balanced (local vs remote balance),"" he explained. ""Since a lot of that is not fully automated yet, it poses a challenge for node operators and an opportunity to test their setup. As the amount gets bigger, it is harder and harder to find routes and keep it going.""  In this way, the lightning torch can help to unearth bugs, Antonopoulos added.  It's even been used to experiment with new tech. The first so-called ""hodlinvoice"" – a new type of tech by LND – was used in the wild for the first time.  As Hodlonaut explained:  ""The way this has played out has completely blown my mind, and made me realize how awesome the bitcoin community is.""  To that end, he's been making sure people know who has the torch and cat-herding the community on Twitter.  Escape from extinguishing  As might be expected from any kind of globe-trotting experiment, the torch itself almost died a few times, most notable on Jan. 31 when a Twitter user by the name of edward_btc stole it.  ""I'll seize it because I can, and no one can stop me. This is bitcoin,"" edward_btc wrote, his point being that bitcoin is supposed to be ""trustless"" money.  The community responded with irritation, not wanting the torch to die out.  ""Are you really going to be *that* guy? Seriously?"" responded Elizabeth Stark, the CEO of Lightning Labs and one of CoinDesk's Most Influential awardees for 2018.  On a darker level, though, edward_btc went as far as to claim that he received death threats for keeping the torch.  And later on, he claimed that he was actually planning to send the torch on. But before he was given a chance, user Klaus Lovegreen swooped in and started a new torch.  ""Is there anyone with some dignity around that that can be trusted with the Lightning Torch?"" he said. Since then, the torch has jumped another 30 hops.  But when will it end? As it stands, there's a hard-coded limit to how large the torch can get: 4,390,000 satoshis, which worth about $150.  Once the torch reaches this threshold, the community plans to donate the proceeds to a charitable cause: likely Bitcoin Venezuela, a non-profit dedicated to raising awareness of cryptocurrency in the troubled South American country.
