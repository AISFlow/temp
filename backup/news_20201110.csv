This deposit contract is the cornerstone of the Ethereum 2.0 update and serves as a bridge for the migration Ethereum network away from proof-of-work (PoW) to a new technical infrastructure that supports proof-of-stake (PoS).      In order to become a transaction validator on the new network (those individuals who process transactions like miners in PoW), an Ethereum user must stake at least 32 ETH. There are currently 52,801 ETH locked up in the deposit contract worth $23.8 million, and it will need at least 524,288 ETH split between 16,384 stakers to trigger Eth 2.0’s “genesis event” and activate the upgrade.      Once Ethereum 2.0 goes live, these validators will begin earning block rewards on the new network at an estimated rate of 8%-15% annually, a lucrative yield that is a necessary deal sweetener for what may be considered a risky upgrade.      A few days after the contract went live, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin sent 3,200 ETH worth roughly $1.4 million to the contract to claim 100 validators. Once the 16,384 validator threshold is reached, then the central nervous system of the new network, the Beacon chain, will go live.      Ethereum developers estimate the Beacon chain will go live sometime in December.

Growth has slowed significantly, however, since the decentralized finance (DeFi) craze that peaked near the end of Q3. Roughly $360 million worth of bitcoins was tokenized in October, significantly less than the $737 million tokenized in September, according to data from Dune Analytics analyzed by CoinDesk.      The primary reason for the slower growth was a steep decline in yield-farming profitability from September’s peak, according to Ryan Watkins, bitcoin analyst at Messari.      “Both Curve and Uniswap farms were big drivers of growth,” Watkins told CoinDesk. “Both yields have fallen significantly since September’s peak.”      Notably, the pace of tokenization still outpaced the rate of mining issuance for the third consecutive month, although October’s margin was significantly smaller than August's or September's. 26,256 BTC were mined in October, according to Coin Metrics while 26,267 BTC were tokenized during the same period.      Wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), the largest tokenized bitcoin project controlling over 80% of the market, minted nearly 26,000 ERC-20 bitcoin-backed tokens in October. In September, over 56,000 new WBTC were issued.      Smaller tokenized bitcoin projects also enjoyed significant growth in October, most notably tBTC, re-launched by Thesis in late September, as CoinDesk reported. Within the first month of its relaunch, tBTC’s supply of bitcoin-backed tokens reached a value of over $10 million. Users also minted and burned over 5,000 BTC during the same period.

A former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Gensler was tapped to lead the agency review team for the Federal Reserve, banking and securities regulators, the Biden campaign formally announced Tuesday, following reports last week he was a contender.      As CFTC chairman, Gensler served as a key financial regulator for former President Barack Obama, spearheading new derivatives rules after the 2008 financial crisis. He also served in the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration.      More recently, he has also testified before Congress about cryptocurrency and blockchain on multiple occasions, pushing back against comparisons between cryptocurrencies and Ponzi schemes and declaring that the still-unlaunched libra token met the requirements of being a security under U.S. law. At an MIT conference two years ago, he opined there was a “strong case” XRP, the cryptocurrency closely associated with startup Ripple, is a security. Gensler called blockchain technology a “change catalyst” in a 2019 op-ed for CoinDesk.      Gensler did not return a request for comment.      He was one of 500 individuals named Tuesday when the Biden-Harris transition team announced the members of the agency review teams who will evaluate the function of federal agencies and help ensure a smooth transition.      To be sure, incumbent President Donald Trump has contested the election results and has filed lawsuits in a handful of states seeking to have votes discounted due to alleged irregularities, though with little evidence so far.    Brain trust    Also on the list for the Biden review team for financial regulators are several other policy experts who have paid careful attention to cryptocurrency, blockchains and related matters:    Simon Johnson, an economist and professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he led digital currency research. He was part of the Congressional Budget Office's Panel of Economic Advisers from April 2009 to April 2015. Johnson has also co-authored a paper about the extensive impact blockchain technology can have on the financial world, and served on CoinDesk’s advisory board.  Chris Brummer, a law professor and the faculty director of Georgetown University’s Institute of International Economic Law, is a familiar figure in the fintech sector who also testified before the U.S. Congress regarding Facebook’s libra project. Brummer was also nominated to serve as a commissioner on the CFTC under President Obama, but the nomination was reversed after the 2016 election.  Mehrsa Baradaran, a University of California at Irvine School of Law professor, specializes in banking law and also testified as an expert witness at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on regulatory frameworks for blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Baradaran has written extensively about inequalities in banking and is a critic of the idea that projects like Facebook’s libra could by default help expand financial inclusion.  Lev Menand, one of the original creators of the digital dollar concept, is an academic fellow and law professor at Columbia University. He served as a senior adviser to the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in 2015-16 and has also worked as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s bank supervision group.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Jaspreet Kalra, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/10/biden-confirms-crypto-savvy-gary-gensler-will-lead-financial-policy-transition-team,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86f97d6a9c02ec4ca6bf7a647e979576b3f19bed-1191x687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to DeFi Pulse, 168,111 BTC, worth $2.5 billion as of press time, is generating yield in various Ethereum-based protocols.      “BTC is digesting the recent confusing macro and political events and consolidating before its next move,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment firm Tellurian Capital. “We are seeing the rotation from BTC to DeFi in full swing now, which is typical of traders redeploying capital to higher yielding assets.”    DeFi value locked at a high    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Tuesday trading around $450 and climbing 0.70% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The amount of cryptocurrency “locked” or held in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols is at a record Tuesday. Over $12.8 billion is currently being held in DeFi, the highest it has ever been according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse.      Ether Capital’s Mosoff says many investors have profited from rising crypto prices and are looking to find additional gains in the DeFi market.      “Total value locked in DeFi is hitting all-time highs likely due to the price increase across all crypto assets and the continued positive sentiment in the space alongside more certainty in the political arena,” Mosoff told CoinDesk.

42422900,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qoTh,1605043039,Multisignature Wallets Can Keep Your Coins Safer (If You Use Them Right),"In traditional business, ""key person risk"" refers to when a company relies too much on one individual to succeed.  Cryptocurrency businesses are prone to a very literal version of this risk when handling funds. The most infamous example may be QuadrigaCX, whose customers have been waiting nearly three years to recoup $115 million worth of deposits since the death of founder Gerald Cotten, the sole possessor of the cryptographic keys to the exchange's wallet.  Fortunately, multisignature cryptocurrency wallets offer a built-in way to manage this sort of risk.  Multisignature wallets (or multisig, for short), are cryptocurrency wallets that require two or more private keys to sign and send a transaction. The storage method requires multiple cryptographic signatures (a private key’s unique fingerprint) to access the wallet.  Of course, multisig is not a panacea, as customers of OKEx learned in October 2020, when the exchange suspended withdrawals, explaining (somewhat cryptically) that one of its key holders was cooperating with an investigation and had fallen ""out of touch."" Without that key holder's authorization, OKEx was unable to give customers their money back.  But properly used, multisig can mitigate the hazards of dealing with digital bearer assets where transactions are irreversible.  What follows is an explainer of how mutisig works, why someone might want to use it, how it can go awry, and more.  How does a multisignature crypto wallet work?  Imagine a bank vault that requires more than one key to open: That’s a little how multisignature cryptocurrency wallets work (and why multisignature wallets are typically called vaults).  You can choose how many keys are allowed to open the vault as well as the minimum number of keys needed to unlock it (e.g., you could have a 2-of-3 multisig where two out of three assigned private keys are needed, 3-of-5, 5-of-7, etc.).  It works like this: Justin, Vittie and Craig set up a multisignature crypto wallet where each holds one key and two of the three keys must be present to send a transaction. To make a payment, Justin would create a transaction and sign it with his key; he would then send this transaction to Vittie, who would sign it with her key. From here, Vittie can either send it back to Justin to finalize the transaction or send it to Craig for him to sign, too (though this last step is not necessary, considering only two of the three keys are needed to unlock the wallet).  Typically, hardware wallets (namely, Trezor, Coldcard and Ledger) are the go-to option for using a multisig setup because they are the safest way to store a private key. Once these wallets are combined into a multisig setup, they create an entirely new multisignature address that is independent of each individual hardware wallet.  When would someone use a multisignature crypto wallet?  For retail investors, multisignature wallets are commonly used to secure bitcoin, but you can also use them for ether and other cryptocurrencies.  Most notably, crypto exchanges, brokers/OTCs, investment funds and other crypto companies use multisignature storage to secure their cold storage funds. Exchanges, brokers and the like distribute admin keys for their funds in order to distribute the risk; if hackers want access to their reserves, they’re going to need several keys to do so. Similarly, multisig ensures no one person in the firm is able to unilaterally withdraw funds from the account. The more signatures you need to execute a transaction, the more distributed the decision-making process can be.  Other specific use cases may involve setting up a shared account among family members (for, e.g., a trust or estate) or an escrow account (for, e.g., a bet or a sale of property). Relatively speaking, multisig is still a niche custody practice among cryptocurrency holders. Still, that doesn’t mean your typical crypto user doesn’t use it to custody their coins.  When multisig goes wrong  Multisig provides an extra layer of protection for cryptocurrencies holdings, but it’s not without risks.  For Bitcoin, multisignature wallet software has come a long way since the early days of Electrum (one of the earliest Bitcoin software wallets, which was also one of the first to support multisig), but it’s still a complex process for less technically savvy users. The Taproot upgrade, which enriched Bitcoin’s scripting language to make coding smart contracts easier, improved consumer-grade multisig software.  Each single-signature wallet has an associated seed phrase that allows users to back up and recover their wallets. A multisig wallet, however, does not have this backup mechanism; this is part of its design. So if you lose the majority of wallets in a multisig and the seed phrases for these wallets, then you lose access to the whole vault (of course, the same could be said for losing the device and seed phrase for a single-signature wallet).  Should I use multisig?  Multisignature proponents argue that multisignature is the most secure and fail-proof way to store cryptocurrency. Even if a thief gets his hands on one of your wallets, for example, they still won’t be able to access your account without the keys to the other wallets in the setup.  Still, there are others who argue the multisignature user experience is not simplified enough for average users, so only those who really know what they’re doing should bother with it.  How do I set up a multisignature wallet?  Historically, multisignature wallets have been the domain of developers or hardcore Bitcoiners because they are difficult to set up from scratch. Luckily, today’s tenderfoot multisignature users have it easier than the trailblazers of yesteryear. Nowadays, there are wallet softwares that streamline the multisig setup process, as well as services that provide customer support and key management services. (For instance, if an unwitting client loses a hardware wallet to the ether, the service has a key as backup.)  For Bitcoin custody specifically, some popular multisig service providers with key management services include Blockstream, Casa and Unchained Capital. Other open-source, do-it-yourself multisig software includes Caravan, Electrum, Lily, Nunchuk and Specter, among others.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb4513db4f64cab6e8e5e65b4a91a803c2aab02c-2560x1702.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433068,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36Ph,1605036065,ShapeShift Delists Privacy Coin Zcash Over Regulatory Concerns,"ShapeShift, the Colorado-based cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to self-custody their assets, has delisted another privacy coin.      Zcash has been removed from the trading platform in addition to monero and dash. Decrypt reported last Friday that XMR and DASH had been quietly removed; the delisting of ZEC was not noted.      ""We've taken down the privacy coins because of their regulatory concerns,"" Veronica McGregor, ShapeShift's chief legal officer, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""At least for the moment, we're not working with those coins.""      XMR, DASH and ZEC ""were delisted at the same time for the same reason – to further derisk the company from a regulatory standpoint,"" McGregor wrote in a follow-up email.      ZEC's removal is somewhat notable because the company invested in the Electric Coin Company, one of the creators of zcash, in 2016, and listed ZEC that October.      ShapeShift has become increasingly cognizant of regulators, despite its founder once having a reputation as a rebel and libertarian.      Formerly, the platform allowed crypto trading without any kind of account or login, but in September 2018 ShapeShift began requiring customers to reveal their identities to the exchange. Later that month, it faced scrutiny after a Wall Street Journal report alleged that ShapeShift had been widely used for money laundering (ShapeShift strongly refuted the claims).    Privacy coins and bank cops    A September report from the law firm Perkins Coie about privacy-enabling cryptocurrencies noted that XMR is a cryptocurrency which is private by default, in that all transactions are made so that only the sender and receiver should know who participated.      ZEC and DASH both make privacy optional.      Read more: Monero and Zcash Conferences Showcase Their Differences (and Links)      Peter Van Valkenburgh is director of research at Coin Center and a member of the Zcash Foundation board. He explained to CoinDesk in a phone call that guidance from the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, ""basically says, you have to make sure you are taking reasonable steps from a cost-benefit analysis to stop the proceeds from crime from flowing through your institution.""      Because many cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, make all transactions and balances public, he explained, working with blockchain surveillance firms like Chainalysis or Elliptic can be enough to be seen as taking reasonable steps.      That said, privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies will be treated, Van Valkenburgh said, like someone who shows up at a bank with a large bag of cash. They may be subject to greater scrutiny or more thorough background checks (as possible examples).      ""To my knowledge, FinCEN has fairly clearly articulated to regulated crypto companies that there is a way to comply, just as banks deal with cash,"" Van Valkenburgh said.      Read more: SEC, CFTC, FinCEN Warn Crypto Industry to Follow US Banking Laws      Though he also offered the caveat that a particular agency or a particular regulator's zeal can be enough to discourage a company from engaging in a line of business, even if no action is taken against them.      ""The Bank Secrecy Act is extremely broad. It affords prosecutors and regulators with a whole lot of powers,"" he said. ""That vagueness about our financial surveillance laws to me is problematic.""

42387609,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQloL3,1605033319,Volume Surge Brings 25% Turnover to 'CoinDesk 20',"Goodbye, dai and bitcoin sv. Hello, kyber and cosmos.  A swelling in volume in the crypto markets over the third quarter has changed the list of noteworthy digital assets beyond bitcoin and ether that matter most to traders and investors. That change is reflected in the CoinDesk 20.  In the latest revision, based on data from the second and third quarters of this year, five assets were replaced by crypto assets that saw volume surges outpacing even the double-digit gains posted in market volume as a whole.  The CoinDesk 20 list is designed to represent the assets that matter most to the market. While other rankings use market capitalization, the CoinDesk 20 lists crypto assets ranked by market volume over two consecutive quarters, as reported by eight trusted crypto exchanges. The CoinDesk 20 represents the 20 assets with the largest amount of consistent, trusted trading volume in crypto. These assets represent about 99% of total volumes on trusted exchanges, and about 90% of the entire sector's market capitalization.  The new assets are algorand, cosmos, cardano, kyber network and omg network. On average, incumbent CoinDesk 20 asset volume increased by 22% from Q2 to Q3. However, these crypto assets' trusted market volume increased by much more.  These five new crypto assets replaced incumbent assets that are well-known to crypto investors. Bitcoin sv, a 2018 fork of bitcoin and dai, the decentralized-finance (DeFi) stablecoin issued by MakerDAO, are both off the CoinDesk 20. So are all three privacy currencies formerly listed: zcash, monero and dash. Of the five, just one, bitcoin sv, showed a decline in dollar volume on trusted exchanges, between Q2 and Q3.  New CoinDesk 20 Assets, Q4 2020, Quarterly Volume Change  Three of the new assets, ALGO, ATOM and ADA, represent ""Web 3"" infrastructure developers, projects that are potential competitors to Ethereum.  Kyber, in particular, grew by an eye-popping percentage, due to its listing on three new exchanges that are included on our trusted list. Coinbase, in particular, handled impressive volume in the KNC token, which is connected to Kyber Network, a decentralized exchange application.  Kyber 2020 Quarterly Volume by Trusted Exchange     Former CoinDesk 20 Assets, Volume Change, 2020 Q3 Over Q2  All three of the privacy coins removed from the CoinDesk 20 grew in volume in Q3, but not by the multiples of the average volume growth their replacements recorded. That doesn't mean DeFi stablecoins and privacy currencies are no longer important or interesting. It means that, at least for now, the verifiable portion of volume in the crypto asset markets has shifted its activity into other assets.  We launched the CoinDesk 20 in July; a September revision saw a small amount of turnover, with one Ethereum-based application token, orchid moving in to replace another, basic attention token.  Orchid, which offers a decentralized virtual private network (VPN) service, remains on the list, with volume growing 562%, quarter over quarter from Q2 to Q3.  The CoinDesk 20 methodology will be reviewed and revised periodically.

42433072,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36Vh,1605033011,MicroStrategy CEO Explains Why Bitcoin Is 'a Million Times Better' Than 'Antiquated' Gold,"MicroStrategy’s headline-grabbing bitcoin bet was a rational response to a macroeconomy in chaos, said Chief Executive Michael Saylor.      Appearing Tuesday at CoinDesk’s Bitcoin for Advisors virtual conference, Saylor shed new light on one of this year’s biggest cryptocurrency stories: his software company’s recent purchases of $425 million in bitcoin.      That surprise September move by Nasdaq-listed MicroStrategy marked one of the first – and largest – embraces of bitcoin by a mainstream corporation.      In a prerecorded fireside chat with CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey, Saylor unpacked MicroStrategy’s bitcoin thought process, why it decided to eschew cash as a treasury reserve and whether gold can reclaim its spot as the marquee store of value in an increasingly digital world.      Saylor’s short answer: Gold can’t. He thinks bitcoin has seized the lead.      Hoarding gold is “an antiquated approach to storing value,” he said. Bitcoin is “a million times better.”    Printer go brr    In Saylor’s telling, MicroStrategy’s bitcoin journey began with the realization its $500 million cash pile was being eaten alive by government money printers. With recent emergency stimulus inflating the U.S. money supply faster than a Thanksgiving parade balloon, company executives felt compelled to move the treasury reserves away from the dollar.      “What we’re trying to do is preserve our treasury,” he said. “The purchasing power of the cash is debasing rapidly.”      Read more: ‘I Didn’t Buy It to Sell It. Ever.’ MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor on His $425M Bitcoin Bet      For the last decade or so, the M2 money supply – the sum of physical cash, checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit and money market funds – grew a modest 5.5%, Saylor noted. “A rational view of business treasury strategy would be, you had to get more than five and a half percent as your cost of capital in order to hold your purchasing power from 2011 to 2020,” he said.      But when COVID-19 hit this year, tanking the economy, the measures taken to contain the damage swelled M2 by 20%, raising the hurdles for corporate treasurers to preserve that purchasing power. “The cost of capital of every cash treasury or every treasury in the world is now 20%,” Saylor said.      To be sure, U.S. inflation, as measured by the core Consumer Price Index (which excludes food and energy) declined briefly in 2020. But to Saylor, that measure is “irrelevant.”      “If inflation only means a market basket of things with no food and energy in them, then almost by definition I've defined a metric which will never go up,” he said.      He pointed to cash holders in inflation-prone countries like Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela. They know all too well their purchasing power takes a hit when money supply expands.      “What if you live in Europe and the United States? It wasn't obvious. But it needs to become obvious,” Saylor said. “I think people will figure it out.”    Bitcoin pivot    Convinced the dollar was no place for MicroStrategy’s excess capital, Saylor said he and his executives began trawling around for a “tangible” asset alternative. “We had to cycle through real estate, bonds, equity, precious metal, derivatives or crypto,” Saylor said.      Of that group, precious metals, particularly gold, has long stood as an enticing store of value, a scarce, safe-haven asset recognized around the world. Not to Saylor. For starters, he balked at the notion that gold is scarce. “Gold is the least abundant of the commodities, but you can still produce gold,” he said.      But he’s also acutely concerned with what he describes as the clashing interests of gold miners and gold bugs. One is trying to capitalize on the market by mining replenishable supply while the other is hoping that access remains scarce, pushing prices up.      Read more: Square Puts 1% of Total Assets in Bitcoin in Surprise $50M Investment      “The gold miners are the enemies of the gold holders,” said Saylor. “The gold miners are trying to destroy your value, right? They're not trying to help you.”      He predicts an even bigger problem with the gold market: Investors fleeing to bitcoin. Even if they don’t know it yet, Saylor thinks gold investors will eagerly dump the commodity for what he calls a superior store of value. It's not an if. It's a when.      “Not a good bet to bet against ingenuity and assume that people will be lazy and ignorant for the next decade, because it's not likely,” Saylor said.    Debasing fiat    Citing one analyst’s prediction that Federal Reserve action will keep equities moving upward regardless of the recent election’s outcome, Saylor said the “most aggressive monetary expansion” is probably ahead.      Investors will therefore likely continue treating blue-chip juggernauts from Apple to Amazon as a new kind of safe haven. “They’re desperately grasping at straws,” Saylor said. All those assets are reliant on the fiat currency he sees as crumbling away.      Read more: Billionaire Hedge Fund Investor Druckenmiller Says He Owns Bitcoin in CNBC Interview      “Equities don't make a good store of value over the long term, unless the company can raise its prices faster than the rate of monetary expansion, or raise its gross margins faster than the rate of monetary expansion,” he said.      Saylor predicts monopolistic corporations will be the only ones positioned to achieve that kind of price pump. But the politicians won’t let those corporations exercise such power indefinitely, he said. So, back to square one.      “Ultimately you have to find something which you can't print more of that doesn't have its fundamental underpinnings tied to a fiat currency, and the only thing that I can find right now is bitcoin,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/10/microstrategy-ceo-explains-why-bitcoin-is-a-million-times-better-than-antiquated-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e08799f5c34aa1bd73249a1628ea1b2bf6512bbe-1500x989.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433064,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36Hh,1605032854,Digital Voting Is Coming. Let's Do It Right.,"As I was writing this, the entire U.S. waited with bated breath to learn the results of the 2020 general election. Although former Vice President Joe Biden has been elected – with one notable dissenting opinion – I have no way of knowing whether my own ballot was counted or declared ""fraudulent"" and thrown out. That matters.      Last week saw reports of voter intimidation, closed polling sites, fears of lost and late ballots and accusations of voter fraud. The COVID-19 pandemic has driven unprecedented levels of mail-in voting, a method which is secure but relies on an infrastructure that is already defunded and spread thin. These problems all build on top of the usual low turnout numbers and the legacy of voter suppression in the U.S.    Nate Williams is a recent graduate and full-stack developer at Vocdoni, an e-voting project built on open source technologies including Ethereum, zk-SNARKs and IPFS.    The chaos surrounding the 2020 election has exposed cracks in the state of U.S. democracy. While much of this uncertainty stems from larger social and political issues, at least some fault can be attributed to the way the election itself was carried out.      This election has made it clear: 19th century voting methods are incapable of adequately expressing the will of such a huge, diverse and fractured population. We need a better way to make decisions.    Is digital voting the solution?    What if we had a system in which everyone could vote from their mobile phone and open a browser to verify the results of an election, all without having to place trust in any central authority?      This system would enable civic participation to fundamentally shift as trust in collective decision-making grows and the barriers to direct democracy shrink. Many of the problems elections currently face, from poor security to voter turnout and beyond, could be ameliorated – if not completely solved – through blockchain voting.      A growing number of people are beginning to see digital voting as a valuable route to recovering public trust. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin discussed the matter recently.    “Develop something now, get it approved (obviously hardest step), and get 300 million plus (fully KYC’ed) users in 4 years time. Any capable developer should be willing to do it ‘for free,” Zhao tweeted.To which Vitalik replied, ""The technical challenges with making a secure cryptographic voting system are significant (and often underestimated), but IMO this is directionally 100% correct.”    Despite a host of challenges, digital voting seems to be an inevitable path forward for many countries. So rather than shying away in hopes that it’s never implemented, we should address these challenges. The technologies behind state-of-the-art cryptocurrencies have already been theorized to solve many of these problems, so they are a good jumping off point.    The trust and privacy dilemma    There are some reasons to be skeptical of our ability to host safe and secure digital elections – countless pieces have been written on this topic. One of the most notable came from YouTuber Tom Scott. As he explains, the main problem with voting can be summarized as a dilemma between two seemingly opposed properties: anonymity and trust.    The solution does not begin and end in blockchain, nor is it only technological.    The only way to fully trust the integrity of a system without relying on any authority is for it to be end-to-end verifiable, accessible and transparent to anyone. But how is this even possible if votes must be anonymous?    Providing trust with blockchain    Since the origins of blockchain, it has been speculated that the technology could be used for voting. However, we have yet to see such a solution deployed.      Many projects claim to use blockchain for voting, but most only leverage it as a mechanism to publish votes that are collected and processed by another system. These claims are misleading, this use of the blockchain does not solve the core issues of digital voting. Votes can still be manipulated up until the point they are published.      See also: ‘Snake Oil and Overpriced Junk’: Why Blockchain Doesn’t Fix Online Voting      In order to offer end-to-end verifiability, a blockchain voting system must allow ballots to be directly cast onto the blockchain. Under such a scheme, any voter can ensure that their vote has been counted. Furthermore, auditors can check the integrity of the system from start to finish.      A blockchain voting system could guarantee that no votes are lost or modified in transit. Due to the open and distributed nature of blockchains, such a system is highly resilient to DDoS attacks and lacks a centralized back end that could misbehave or be infected with malware. And, notably, results would be available as soon as an election ends.    Providing privacy with zero-knowledge proofs    The amazing transparency of the blockchain also limits its ability to provide privacy to digital voting.      A blockchain is a perfect structure to log and ensure the integrity of data, but it also allows the origins of this data to be traced. An anonymous voting system would need to decouple transactions (ballots) from their origins. Enter zk-SNARKs.      See also: George Samman – The Trend Towards Blockchain Privacy: Zero Knowledge Proofs      A zk-SNARK is a cutting-edge, cryptographic-proof construction that provides us with the ability to prove possession of certain private information, without revealing this information. Applied to voting, a zk-SNARK circuit could permit a voter to prove he or she belongs to a census and is able to cast a ballot, all without revealing their identity or allowing their ballot to be traced by others.      This could be achieved by creating a “census” of participants’ public keys and using zk-SNARKs so voters can prove they belong without revealing those keys. A more detailed account for such a model is found here.      We can therefore create a voting-specific blockchain where, instead of paying a fee, you can post transactions after proving that you belong to the census by generating a zero-knowledge proof.      This is an incredible construct; it almost feels like magic. We now have a ballot that has no signature, and therefore can’t be traced back to an address, along with a proof that allows this ballot to be included in a completely end-to-end verifiable blockchain. On top of that, the voter does need to pay for any gas or fee, so no token is involved.    Is this model resilient to attacks?    Strong public blockchains are inherently resilient to censorship attacks, but vote buying and bribery are also significant concerns.    Digital voting seems to be an inevitable path forward for many countries.    If voters are coerced, it would be possible for them to override their votes later on, without fear of double-spending. And there are some clever tricks that render vote buying unviable by allowing anyone to exhibit a valid proof for any vote once an election has closed.    What blockchain voting won’t fix    The solution does not begin and end in blockchain, nor is it only technological. There are several challenges with digital voting and elections, such as accessibility and universal authentication, that require government involvement and don’t have simple technological fixes.      See also: Gregory Magarshak – In Defense of Blockchain Voting      But these are issues that can be addressed and iterated upon with pilot projects and investment in better authentication mechanisms. The Achilles heel of this voting system is the user client app (equivalent to a crypto wallet). Trust in the OS and the app implementation would likely be required.    So, can we have reliable elections using blockchain?    The first compelling examples of such a solution are beginning to pop up. I’ve been exposed to the possibility of blockchain voting while working on Vocdoni Open Stack, an open-source project that for the last three years has been devoted to deconstructing the problem of decentralized voting.      We have designed a protocol and a set of libraries that are bringing radical new solutions to what, until now, has been an unsolved problem. A trustless, end-to-end, verifiable and anonymous voting system. Our technological infrastructure is publicly available here and has already been successfully proven with dozens of organizations including the largest cultural organization in Europe with almost 200,000 voters.      It’s a mistake to think we can achieve the perfect digital voting system, as 100% security will never exist. This is the case for physical voting as well. But we can now build voting systems that provide, to our digital society, equal or greater guarantees than those presented by physical voting.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Nathaniel Williams,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/10/digital-voting-is-coming-lets-do-it-right,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c34fc19281727581a4f52a13eadaee285ad3ca6c-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433065,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36Lh,1605030834,The Case for Bitcoin Banking (Despite Cred's Bankruptcy),"The crypto lender Cred recently filed for bankruptcy, after apparently suffering significant losses in its loan portfolio. While the final details of the insolvency have yet to be determined, the postmortems have already begun to roll in. A number of Bitcoiners have used the occasion to reinforce that eternal doctrine: not your keys, not your coins. And, indeed, this is an idea that I am sympathetic to. True ownership of bitcoin requires knowledge of a private key which allows you to spend the UTXOs in question.      But it is also naive to believe bitcoin credit will cease to exist following the failure of this intermediary. Credit is a natural phenomenon that emerges in every stable society. It is merely codified promise-making. When promises can be rendered enforceable through laws and contracts, credit can emerge. And credit permits society’s idle resources to be allocated to firms and entrepreneurs who can more effectively put them to use. It is only in truly broken societies that credit does not exist. In Venezuela, for instance, long-term lending is virtually impossible because the currency these loans would be denominated in is too unpredictable. Hence lenders cannot have any assurance they would get a return in real terms. Property must be bought in cash, structurally limiting the vibrancy of the real estate market.    CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup. Disclosure: Castle Island Ventures is an investor in BlockFi, a crypto brokerage and wealth management platform.    In the wake of Cred’s failure, I have seen calls to terminate all bitcoin banking, and for crypto lenders to prove the existence of reserves. This misses the point somewhat: while more transparency into reserve or liquidity ratios would be welcome, these lenders are actively bundling up user deposits and issuing loans. The guarantees associated with a fully reserved institution (like a custodian) is simply not possible with a lender, as auditing a portfolio of loans is a different and more complex activity than simply demonstrating ownership of some units of cryptocurrency. There is no way to fully mitigate the risk of default, nor should there be: interest is compensation for taking on risk. If someone offers you risk-free interest, something is wrong.      As a reminder, conventional commercial banks do not hold everyone’s dollars in their vaults and magically generate interest. They create loans, pass on a portion of the interest generated to depositors, and maintain a reserve with which to honor withdrawals. The traditional business of banking involves financing long-term projects for a return while offering depositors short term liquidity, should they need it. Because there is a difference in the maturity of the deposits (instant) and the loans (long-term), this is referred to as maturity transformation. This is the true alchemy of capital, taking savings and transforming them into productive capital deployed into the economy.      Crypto lending involves less maturity transformation – since few businesses desire a long-term liability denominated in bitcoin, a fundamentally deflationary asset – and has more in common with securities lending. Consumers of crypto credit include firms with bitcoin-denominated liquidity requirements and a desire for leverage, like market makers, proprietary trading firms, arbitrage funds, and businesses with large bitcoin inventory demands like exchanges (which may not want to dip into their cold storage to honor withdrawals) or bitcoin ATM companies. Miners, who do have Bitcoin-denominated cash flows, are also occasional consumers of bitcoin credit. In a June 2019 blog post, BlockFi (a Cred competitor) lists the types of companies participating in crypto lending: “70% market makers, 25% funds and 5% exchanges.”      Credit in this market has positive but hard-to-observe effects. Market makers keep exchanges in line with each other and enable tight spreads. It is these market makers who take the other side of your market buys and ensure you don’t face too much slippage. Funds borrowing for short selling purposes have an incentive to surface information and incorporate it into price. Funds taking out loans to trade the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) instrument continually force down the premium and render it more efficient for retail investors. If you’ve ever used a spot or derivative exchange, or a financial Bitcoin product, you have probably benefited from the existence of crypto-native credit. (Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is a unit of DCG.)      See also: Nic Carter - The Crypto-Dollar Surge and the American Opportunity      Elsewhere, in our current negative interest rate regime, banking is a fundamentally unprofitable activity. The Federal Reserve’s increasingly desperate interventions into the economy via the blunt instrument of interest rates have squeezed businesses with net interest margin business models. This has led to a wave of consolidation across the bank sector over the last 30 years. Since 1990, the number of chartered banking institutions has declined in the United States by 10,092, or 67%, according to Banking Strategist. This consolidation has driven up the average size of banks, with adverse outcomes. Community banks have suffered while megabanks have gained market share. Because smaller banks generally lend to smaller businesses, this consolidation has caused credit to become more scarce for the firms that need it. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is lowering the cost of capital for the hyper-liquid Apple (and other well-financed corporations) by buying its bonds on the secondary market.      The crypto industry offers a refreshing alternative to this increasingly stagnant banking system. Forward-thinking legislators in Wyoming have shown great initiative by creating a new kind of bank charter, the Special Purpose Depository Institution. Already, two crypto companies – Kraken Financial and Caitlin Long’s Avanti – have obtained the SPDI charter. This will permit them to operate as full-reserve banks, linking bitcoin and the federal reserve payments system. Additionally, interest rates for bitcoin, ether and stablecoins are structurally high due to a relentless demand for credit in a fast-growing and under-provisioned industry.      The high interest rates act as a gravity well, sucking in commercial bank dollars and causing them to be converted into crypto-native stablecoin liquidity. A number of providers including Dharma, Linen and Voluto, among others, are now instrumentalizing these stablecoin yields and creating alternative, consumer-facing lending products with a user experience that rivals popular fintechs. While bank indexes globally keep plunging and interest rates for depositors are negative in real terms, crypto banking is showing immense growth and vigor, and maintaining high yields despite cyclical slowdowns in subsectors like DeFi.    Proof-of-reserves    I am aware that any Rothbardian credit skeptics will be reading this with concern, tending to prefer fully reserved banking models. But there are good reasons to believe that a banking system built atop bitcoin would be more resistant to the failures of both the fiat system, and the gold-based system that came before. Bitcoin banks distinguish themselves in a few key ways.      First, bitcoin, as a natively digital asset, is inherently auditable. This means that I can prove to a third party that I own some bitcoin, and they to me. For deposit-taking institutions, this manifests as Proof-of-Reserve (PoR). However, PoR is most salient and helpful for full-reserve institutions, where a simple accounting of assets and liabilities can suffice. For institutions engaged in lending, a related proof can be used to facilitate a transparent reserve or liquidity ratio. Not to a financial regulator, but to the general public and to its depositors. I would envision a world where end users can freely choose between deposit-taking institutions operating at different levels of reserve, opting for a level of risk they are comfortable with.      Secondly, in a Bitcoin regime, taking physical delivery of the base monetary asset is trivial. Thanks to the cheap cost of running a full node, a regular individual with commodity computing hardware can “assay” and validate some bitcoin they are receiving with little difficulty. The ease of withdrawing your assets from a financial institution dramatically reduces exit costs and should encourage vibrant competition among depository institutions.    Relish the dynamism and riskiness of crypto banking, the structurally high interest rates, and the fact that these institutions can fail.    This is vastly different from the gold system, in which the high cost of verification (and transport) mean that gold eventually consolidates into a handful of walled gardens. In the fiat system, taking ownership of the underlying asset is virtually impossible; ask your local bank to withdraw the contents of your bank account in federal reserve notes and you will likely get a puzzled expression. The fiat banking system has no liability-free monetary commodity at its base; instead it is backed by an increasingly capricious and politicized Federal Reserve.      Lastly, a banking system built atop Bitcoin is one in which federal depository insurance is impossible. Many believe this is a bug, but in my view it is a powerful feature. The FDIC is a lever of state control that has historically been used to weaponize the banking sector against lawful but disfavored industries. Additionally, guaranteeing bank deposits (and implicitly, the entire banking system) eliminates a market feedback mechanism and homogenizes the industry.      Indeed, the failure of a Bitcoin bank reinforces the merit of a Bitcoin-based financial system. In a fiat system, banks rarely fail: they are effectively guaranteed by the government. Depositors bear no risk, and have no incentive to carefully evaluate the institutions that they do business with. Sufficiently large banks have a virtual guarantee of a bailout, with the cost borne by taxpayers (or financed through more monetary issuance). Since the supply of bitcoin cannot be inflated, a socialized banking system is unlikely to develop on top of the asset.      By no means is the state of credit in the crypto industry perfect. I expect many more failures from these depository institutions. But with each failure, depositors will gain an appreciation for the merit of diligence, and will start to scrutinize these institutions more carefully. And each failure is evidence that financial institutions can, indeed, fail, without the state stepping in. These painful lessons will force the industry to adopt best practices around transparency, depository assurances, and reserve ratios.

42433073,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36Xh,1605028567,"Blockchain Bites: Billionaire Bullish on Bitcoin, Updates on Fowler's Crypto Capital Case and More","Another billionaire investor disclosed his bitcoin bags. The Silvergate Exchange Network added another exchange member. Riot Blockchain, a publicly traded bitcoin mining firm, recorded bumper revenues with plans to expand.    Top shelf    Billionaire’s bitcoin Billionaire U.S. investor Stanley Druckenmiller, who just weeks ago was said to be shorting the dollar, is long on bitcoin. In a Monday CNBC appearance, Druckenmiller disclosed a bitcoin position significantly smaller than his gold horde. However, he predicts bitcoin will outperform gold in the long run – largely due to millennial and Silicon Valley attraction to the crypto scene. ""Frankly, if the gold bet works the bitcoin bet will probably work better because it's thinner, more illiquid and has a lot more beta to it,” he said. Drunkenmiller made headlines last week for his bearish views on the U.S. dollar, which he suspects will decline for the next three to four years.      Botched BSV A protocol change in at least one Bitcoin SV (BSV) multisig wallet has crippled security and led to lost customer funds. Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell found that after BSV developers removed a proven transaction script and replaced it with an outdated version, one wallet manufacturer’s home-brewed hash function has serious security flaws. The ElectrumSV wallet’s so-called “accumulator multi-sig” function cancels transfers if more than the minimum number of keys sign a transaction and, perhaps more dangerously, enables anyone to access multi-sig funds “with too few signatures (such as none at all).” One BSV user, Aaron Zhou, lost 600 BSV to an attack exploiting this weakness.      Legal maneuvers Lawyers are looking to ditch Reginald Fowler – accused of running a “shadow banking” service for cryptocurrency exchanges – as a client, according to court documents. Fowler and partner Ravid Yosef, who remains at large, stand accused of opening bank accounts with various financial institutions to illegally store funds. The partners’ bank, Crypto Capital, is further tied up in a $850 million black hole of crypto funds that went missing from the Bitfinex exchange in 2019. In October, Fowler considered reopening plea bargain talks. Fowler's lawyers gave no explicit reason for wanting to withdraw from the case.      SEN zen Binance.US is the latest U.S. exchange to join the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN). The 24/7 instant settlement network allows crypto exchanges to move cash between themselves, replacing slower wire transfers, at any time of day. Gemini, Kraken and ErisX are all participants in the service, which saw $17.4 billion in first quarter volume. “We’ve launched SEN for our corporate clients so now they’re able to move dollars through Silvergate around the clock, instantaneously,” Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley said. “It’s a huge advantage for clients that are trying to get funds into Binance.US to be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and we’re excited to see the impact on the rest of our liquidity.”      Riot’s returns Riot Blockchain recorded over $2.4 million in mining revenue in Q3, a 42% increase year over year, according to the publicly traded firm’s latest corporate filing, though it is operating with a quarterly $1.7 million net loss. Having mined 222 BTC (a 41% bump from the same period last year), Riot’s corporate cryptocurrency liquidity grew from $7.2 million in Q2 to $9 million in Q3. And with $30.1 million in cash reserves, Riot is looking to expand its fleet of Bitmain S19-Pro mining machines. Riot shares traded hands at $3.50 at Monday's close, up 32% from the start of Q4. They've risen more than 200% year to date.    Quick bites  Obsessively checking prices. Rabbit holes of crypto content. All-night trading sessions. Jeff Wilser presents the face of crypto addiction.

(Bloomberg)  Market intel    Trend lines CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole examines three major trends contributing to bitcoin’s two-month-long rally. Having peaked at 33-month highs near $16,000, experts are citing increased institutional participation (high-net-worth individuals such as investor Stanley Druckenmiller and publicly traded firms Square and MicroStrategy), a supply crunch (huge spot market buys from retail investors and funds like Grayscale’s GBTC trust have significantly reduced bitcoin supply, driving up the price); and technical analysis to explain bitcoin’s rise. (Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is a unit of DCG.)    At stake    Regulatory matters “Regulators are slow and there’s a reason we’re slow,” Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) member Hester Peirce said yesterday at CoinDesk’s Bitcoin for Advisors virtual event.      “We need to have [a] process in place so that we make sure when we’re changing rules people have notice that we’re thinking about changing a rule and they can comment,” she said.      When confronted with the quickly evolving crypto landscape, however, Peirce said the agency could do more to be proactive. Noting it is less top-heavy than it appears, Pierce said the SEC’s five commissioners usually defer to the agency’s staff to approve or disapprove novel products like exchange-traded funds (ETF).      In one such example of this arrangement, yesterday the SEC’s Division of Investment Management issued a letter seeking comment on an expanded definition of a “qualified custodian.”      In response to the Wyoming Division of Banking’s recent decision to affirm the wealth management firm Two Ocean Trust as a qualified custodian eligible to custody digital assets for its clients, the SEC is now asking questions. Traditionally, qualified custodians were limited to banks, registered broker-dealers and certain derivatives merchants, all subject to stringent regulation.      Now, with at least one state granting a public trust company qualified custodian status under state law, the federal watchdog is looking to add clarity to the definition.      Industry publication Decrypt writes: “The SEC’s letter asks for public comments on a variety of questions, for example, who’s been left out of the qualified custodian definition that should be in? Who’s in, who should be out? And, importantly, do state-chartered trust companies like Two Ocean have the same characteristics as banks?”      Depending on where the SEC lands, this could open the door for other public trust companies – like pensions, endowments and foundations, Caitlin Long, head of Avanti said – to enter the crypto fold.      As Peirce said yesterday: “There are circumstances where we have a framework at the SEC that was built in the 1930s and 1940s and added on over time,” she said. “Certainly now that we’re seeing what’s happening in the crypto space, for example, there are areas we are going to have to make adjustments and I do think we should move faster … I’m impatient there.”    Who won #CryptoTwitter?",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/10/blockchain-bites-billionaire-bullish-on-bitcoin-updates-on-fowlers-crypto-capital-case-and-more,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d5310bd46bb362e564a6f22f9afe5f9725798a9-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433058,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36Dh,1605019014,Texture Capital Awarded FINRA License to Trade Security Tokens,"Texture Capital is preparing to launch a digital securities trading hub for private capital markets after getting the green light from a U.S. financial regulator.      With its Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) broker-dealer registration and alternative trading system go-ahead, revealed to CoinDesk Tuesday, Texture moves closer to taking its issuance marketplace live.      The one-year-old blockchain company is the latest tokenization outfit hoping to capture even a sliver of the hulking marketplace for private securities. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told Congress in an August report that companies and funds raised $1.5 trillion through so-called ""Regulation D"" exempt offerings in 2019.      Although mountains of capital stream into Reg D offerings, the securities themselves seldom flow around. ""Most [private] securities do not trade in a secondary market"" the SEC report said. Lockup periods and other restrictions account for some of the illiquidity.      According to Texture CEO Richard Johnson, the right tech stack can fix that.      ""Other participants have tried and had some success – e.g., Nasdaq Private Market, Forge and the newly announced ClearList,"" Johnson said. ""This demonstrates the demand for institutional access to private companies.""      However, Texture believes it gains an edge by using ""the latest technology"" (blockchain), and by"" tackling the underlying problems with private securities market structure,"" he said.      Also read: Russian Metal Giant’s Tokenization Firm Expands to America      Issuing a security token on-chain can help bring efficiency and transparency to private securities, the CEO continued. Similarly, building the secondary trading hub right into the platform might allow investors to flip their tokens far more seamlessly than they otherwise could.      Johnson is also keen on ensuring non-blockchain companies see the appeal of tokenized securities.      Texture hopes to have 20 issuers on its platform in the next six months. For comparison, tZero, one of the best-known security token marketplaces, only has three. But getting more tokens up and running will be a boon for overall liquidity, Johnson said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/10/texture-capital-awarded-finra-license-to-trade-security-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6497c7ce4873e1f9565bdd49a38420ecf57be85-1500x881.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433063,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36Jh,1605017440,3 Ways Coinbase Could Lose Its Crypto Crown,"In 2012, Coinbase consisted of two guys in a San Francisco apartment. Today, it’s a colossus that dominates the crypto retail business in the U.S. while also boasting a thriving exchange for professional traders.      Coinbase has also acquired or invested in dozens of other crypto firms and, thanks to one of those acquisitions, now stores around 5% of all bitcoin in the world. So it’s no wonder that, if you ask average people to name a crypto company, they’ll say Coinbase.      This dominance is why I titled my new book about Coinbase ""Kings of Crypto."" Like Apple is to cell phones or Nike is to shoes, Coinbase is to cryptocurrency. The company’s story – full of drama and infighting – is a gripping startup yarn, but also shows how one firm can change an industry. It is thanks, in part, to Coinbase that bitcoin entered the mainstream, and why crypto is becoming such a force in the larger financial world.    Jeff Roberts is a senior writer for Fortune who has covered Bitcoin since 2013. ""Kings of Crypto: One Startup’s Quest to Take Cryptocurrency Out of Silicon Valley and Onto Wall Street"" will be published by Harvard Business Review Press on Dec. 15 (pre-order here). The title is already available on Amazon Audible.    Coinbase’s ascendance to the pinnacle of the crypto world is no coincidence. Since its modest beginnings, founder Brian Armstrong has focused relentlessly on two things: Making its products easy to use and staying on the right side of regulators. This ensured Coinbase became the first stop for millions of novice bitcoin buyers, while also avoiding the legal scrapes that sidelined competitors.      After being slow to add other cryptocurrencies – a situation that triggered a civil war between former top Coinbase executives Asiff Hirji and Balaji Srinivasan – the company now offers nearly two dozen coins. And when it adds a coin, its influence is such that it still generates a brief price pop known as the “Coinbase effect.” Meanwhile, Coinbase last month rolled out a crypto debit card in the U.S. that lets users earn bitcoin rewards with no fee when paying with a stablecoin – finally providing a practical reason to use one.      Coinbase still has formidable rivals, of course. It also has no shortage of haters. Right from the start, critics mocked Coinbase with taunts of “not your keys, not your coins” – a knock on Coinbase’s practice of holding its customers’ funds, which Bitcoin purists regard as a betrayal of Satoshi’s ideals. Today, certain crypto cliques mock the company as stodgy and corporate compared to more free-wheeling competitors like Kraken and Binance.      For Coinbase, all of this is just noise. The company is valued north of $12 billion and, backed by blue-chip investors, is poised to be the first crypto firm to go public – a process that could bring blockchain tokens to the public securities markets for the first time.      See also: 5% of Coinbase Employees Take Severance Offer Over ‘Apolitical’ Stance      Meanwhile, the company is quietly expanding its ties with the Wall Street banking world. Those ties include a relationship with JPMorgan, which came about after a secret meeting in 2019 between Armstrong and the bank’s powerful CEO, Jamie Dimon, who was once Bitcoin’s most prominent critic.    Three threats    In short, Coinbase is on top. The question is whether it will stay there and, for now, there are three obstacles that could thwart that.      The first is regulation. While Coinbase has done a better job than any other at playing by Washington’s rules, many in the federal government still have an implacable – and often irrational – hostility to crypto. This could lead Coinbase to become embroiled in expensive and distracting investigations, which could hurt its focus and open the door to competitors.      And while the company is learning to play the lobbying game it’s no match for the big banks, which have had their tentacles in lawmakers for decades and could push for rules that rig crypto regulation in favor of financial incumbents. There’s no sign this is happening yet but, as crypto baron Barry Silbert of CoinDesk parent DCG told me, “In the long term, it’s not Coinbase versus Binance. It’s Coinbase versus JPMorgan.” If that’s the case, Coinbase’s current alliance with the big bank could turn to a strategic rivalry where the latter has the edge working the regulators.      The second thing that could dethrone Coinbase is big, well-funded opponents. While industry giant Binance is seen as Coinbase’s main rival, its fast-and-loose style has made it radioactive to regulators and unlikely to last in the long term. Crypo OG Wences Casares told me Binance is likely to go the way of one-time giants Mt. Gox and Poloniex. Instead, the more dangerous competitors for Coinbase are likely to be banks or fintech giants like Square and PayPal, which are moving into the crypto realm with the force of a freight train. Then there is Facebook, which is already standing up a global crypto offering, and Apple, whose huge user base and privacy-conscious values make it a likely candidate to offer crypto wallets of its own. If these tech titans power into crypto, Coinbase could clean up by offering its expertise to them – or it could simply get eaten.      See also: Emily Parker - Coinbase’s ‘Mission’ Violates the Spirit of Bitcoin      Regulation and competition are external threats. The third and possibly biggest threat to Coinbase’s long-term dominance is an internal one: its culture. That culture was on display this summer when Armstrong published a blog post declaring Coinbase to be an apolitical company – a decision that led numerous employees to quit and the media to pillory the CEO as insensitive. While some praised Armstrong for speaking truths other CEOs would not say, more people saw his blog post as reflecting the narrow worldview of crypto believers – a worldview that sees itself as apolitical but is in fact a siloed ideology shared by a handful of wealthy, mostly white men. This ideology is a problem for the crypto industry as a whole, which has done a poor job of welcoming women and people concerned about diversity, but especially for Coinbase.      Great companies create cultures where people of all backgrounds can belong – even those led by ruthless, combative leaders like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. Armstrong has long displayed the same sort of original thinking as Jobs and Musk, but he has yet to show he can attract the same sort of unswerving loyalty. To do so, and for Coinbase to succeed in the long term, he’ll have to improve the company’s corporate culture.      These three obstacles – regulation, competition and corporate culture – pose serious long-term challenges to Coinbase’s current dominance. But for now at least, no one is poised to take Coinbase’s crypto crown.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Jeff Roberts,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/10/3-ways-coinbase-could-lose-its-crypto-crown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/411766dc685ef5d17fc285b79908f2d77a190f5a-2047x1356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433078,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36dh,1605017415,First Mover: Bitcoin Needs No Vaccine as Druckenmiller Lays Down 'Better Bet',"Bitcoin was higher, though barely, appearing to settle into a new range over the past several days between roughly $14,800 and $15,600.      ""Should bitcoin prices consolidate this week,"" wrote Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset firm Diginex, ""it would set us up for the next leg up towards $17,000.""      In traditional markets, European and Asian shares inched up while U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open. Gold rose 0.7% to $1,876 an ounce.    Market moves    Bitcoin's price slide Monday amid a vaccine-powered surge in U.S. stocks sent cryptocurrency analysts scrambling to explain the investment logic, while highlighting the on-again, off-again synchronicity between digital-asset and traditional markets.      The progress reported by Pfizer toward developing a vaccine could portend a faster-than-expected recovery in the global economy. A rebound in consumer demand would bring about faster growth in corporate earnings and thus improve prospects for stocks.      An economic acceleration also theoretically could speed up inflation and by extension boost bitcoin, seen by a growing number of investors as an inflation hedge similar to gold. The investing legend Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Monday that he owned ""many, many more times gold than I own bitcoin, but frankly if the gold bet works, the bitcoin bet will probably work better.""      But nothing is simple in the art of pinpointing fickle and topsy-turvy market narratives, especially during a year when the hand of governments and central banks has been particularly heavy, in the form of trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus they've pumped into the financial system.      According to Bloomberg, economists immediately began to speculate that any improvement brought by a vaccine might simply relieve pressure on the U.S. lawmakers to rush out a new coronavirus stimulus bill, or on the Federal Reserve to accelerate its $120 billion-a-month in asset purchases. All things being equal, less stimulus might mean less inflation.      ""Assuming the Pfizer vaccine is as effective as currently indicated, it will take several months to manufacture and inoculate large segments of the population,"" wrote Thomas Perfumo, strategy director at Kraken Intelligence, an analysis unit of the similarly named cryptocurrency exchange. ""The key question is whether additional fiscal stimulus is on the horizon and how asset values, including bitcoin, continue to digest the swell in unprecedented fiscal and monetary response.""      Of course the 11-year-old bitcoin has defied market prognosticators for most of its history, and some cryptocurrency traders say the daily price movements represent little more than a statistical random walk, or maybe correlation without causation. Bitcoin has blown away every other major asset class in 2020, with a 113% year-to-date gain versus 10% for stocks and 24% for gold.      Bitcoin's price correlation over the past 90 days with both stocks and gold stands at a positive but weak level of 0.35, where 1 represents perfect synchronicity, -1 a perfectly inverse relationship, and 0 no connection at all.      It might also be weak to draw too many inferences beyond just that the bitcoin bet appears to be winning.    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin (BTC) has chalked up a stellar price rally in the past two months, reaching 33-month highs close to $16,000.      The uptrend began in early September after buyers bought a dip below $10,000, and gathered pace in the second half of October. Last week, prices reached a high of $15,971, a level last seen in January 2018. That’s a 63% price gain in eight weeks, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Over 2018 and 2019, bitcoin often languished below $10,000, struggling to recover from a crash that followed the late 2017 surge to record highs near $20,000.      So what’s behind the rapid gains in recent weeks? Here are three of the primary factors driving the bull market:    Increased institutional participation: “Over the past eight weeks, we have seen various notable public companies and hedge funds enter the cryptocurrency market with sizable deployment of capital,” Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Singapore-based Stack Funds said.  Supply crunch: “Between Grayscale’s GBTC trust, MicroStrategy and the influx of other large spot buyers, the supply of bitcoin is beginning to look more scarce,” Dibb said. Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk’s parent firm, Digital Currency Group.  Technical breakout: Bitcoin’s bullish bias strengthened following the cryptocurrency’s convincing break above $12,500 in the third week of October.    - Omkar Godbole      Read More: 3 Reasons Bitcoin Has Rallied Over 60% in Just Two Months    Token watch    Bitcoin SV (BSV): Flaw in Bitcoin SV multisig wallet puts funds at risk.

42433074,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36bh,1605011016,3 Reasons Bitcoin Has Rallied Over 60% in Just Two Months,"Bitcoin (BTC) has chalked up a stellar price rally in the past two months, reaching 33-month highs close to $16,000.      The uptrend began in early September after buyers bought a dip below $10,000, and gathered pace in the second half of October.      Last week, prices reached a high of $15,971, a level last seen in January 2018. That's a 63% price gain in eight weeks, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Over 2018 and 2019, bitcoin often languished below $10,000, struggling to recover from a crash that followed the late 2017 surge to record highs near $20,000.      So, what's behind the rapid gains in recent weeks? Here are three of the primary factors driving the bull market:    1. Increased institutional participation    ""Over the past eight weeks, we have seen various notable public companies and hedge funds enter the cryptocurrency market with sizable deployment of capital,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Singapore-based Stack Funds said.      On Sept. 15, listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) announced the purchase of $250 million worth of bitcoins, and three weeks later payments company Square (NYSE: SQ) also disclosed its investment in the bitcoin market.      In October, leverage in the derivatives market was also skewed bullish, with institutions holding record long positions in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.      Also read: Institutions Take Record Bullish Bets in Bitcoin Futures, Shrugging Off Exchange Missteps      The increased institutional participation likely created upward pressure on prices. Further, it buoyed broader market sentiment and likely prompted more buyers to join the market.      The number of bitcoin whale entities – clusters of addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – rose to four-year highs at the end of October. Retail participation increased, too, as suggested by the ""accumulation addresses"" metric rising to record highs.      Since the coronavirus pandemic hit, expectations for additional U.S. fiscal stimulus alongside the Federal Reserve's ongoing inflation-boosting bond purchase programs have triggered fears of a dollar sell-off, and motivated both institutions and retailers to put at least some money into bitcoin.      ""The talks of further stimulus efforts has put bitcoin on the map as a quasi-safe haven, possessing many of the store-of-value qualities of gold, despite its relatively [brief] existence,"" Dibb said.      Also read: World’s Growing Stockpile of Negative-Yielding Debt a Positive for Bitcoin, Say Analysts    2. Supply crunch    Large spot buyers, mostly institutions, have created a shortfall in bitcoin liquidity, pressuring prices to the higher side.      ""Between Grayscale’s GBTC trust, MicroStrategy and the influx of other large spot buyers, the supply of bitcoin is beginning to look more scarce,"" Dibb said. Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk's parent firm, Digital Currency Group.      Further, retail investors took direct custody of their coins by moving them from exchanges to their own wallets, adding to the drying up of sell-side liquidity. The total number of bitcoins held on cryptocurrency exchanges has fallen 9% to 2,404,788 BTC in the past two months, according to Glassnode data.      The decline in exchange balances is indicative of strong holding sentiment in the market.    3. Technical breakout    Bitcoin's bullish bias strengthened following the cryptocurrency's convincing break above $12,500 in the third week of October.      Back then, many analysts had pointed to $12,500 as the level to beat for the bulls. That's because the cryptocurrency had declined sharply following a rejection near $12,500 in August.      “The real resistance level is around $12,500-ish, so, until a meaningful breakout above that level, nothing is done,"" David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, told CoinDesk on Oct. 20.      Indeed, the eventual breakout above $12,500 looks to have invited stronger chart-driven buying pressure.      Bitcoin ended the third week of October above the key hurdle and remained bid in the following two weeks. Now support, at $12,500, hasn't been tested since.

42433069,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36Rh,1605009638,West African Program Will Store Weather Data on Telos Blockchain,"Telos has partnered with open-source weather technology company Telokanda Weather Group to launch an initiative to collect and share weather data in West Africa on the Telos public blockchain.      Telokanda will use the Telos blockchain to help university students and farming communities record and share weather data with the goal of improving climate research, hurricane tracking and local weather forecasting, the companies said in a statement Tuesday.      According to the announcement, the project was developed by a team in West Africa that includes former Boeing and NASA engineer Nicolas Lopez.      High-altitude weather balloons, launched by citizens in West African countries, will carry lightweight devices called radiosondes into the air while beaming atmospheric data, including pressure, temperature and wind speed, back to Earth.      The project hopes to motivate citizens to participate in weather data collection by developing a method of sending digital currency instantly to people who launch their weather balloons, incentivizing timely and consistent launches, the announcement said.      The announcement said that once a weather balloon transmits data to the blockchain, a smart contract will trigger payments in telos tokens (TLOS) to the operators' digital wallets. Each reward of about $15 can be converted to local fiat currencies such as the Nigerian Naira or Ghanaian Cedis via the Sesacash app.      A spokesperson for the project told CoinDesk via email that at first rewards will come from the Telos Worker Proposal System but in the future, the funds will come from NGOs that want to use the data for weather forecasting and research.      So far Telokanda has partnered with the University of Uyo and Rivers State University in Nigeria, as well as Academic City where students will launch the balloons and track the data.    See also: Chainlink to Provide Data for Farming Insurance Startup Arbol    “This project can quickly grow into one that will save lives and help prevent billions of dollars in weather damage while rewarding local participants for their efforts,” Douglas Horn, chief architect of the Telos blockchain, said in a statement to the press.      The project has so far completed eight launches.

In a court document filed Monday, no definitive reason was given for the motion due to attorney-client privilege.  However, Fowler's lawyers, James McGovern and Michael Hefter of law firm Hogan Lovells, cited Local Civil Rule 1.4, which states an attorney for a party may be allowed a court order to withdraw for a ""satisfactory reason.""  According to the motion, filed in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York, McGovern and Hefter have informed Fowler multiple times since Feb. 26 of this year that they wished to withdraw.  They asked the court to delay deadlines in the case to allow Fowler's new representation to get up to speed.  Fowler is one of two individuals accused of running a “shadow banking” service for cryptocurrency exchanges. The other individual, Ravid Yosef, remains at large.  Allegedly acting under the guise of processing real estate transactions, the pair opened bank accounts with various financial institutions to illegally store funds on behalf of cryptocurrency exchanges.  Crypto Capital, the ""shadow bank"" Fowler stands accused of operating, is allegedly tied up in an $850 million black hole of crypto funds that went missing from the Bitfinex exchange in 2019.

42433061,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO36Bh,1604998806,Ex-Microsoft Dev Gets 9 Years in Prison Over $10M Theft Involving Bitcoin Mixing,"A former software engineer at Microsoft received a nine-year prison sentence Monday for an elaborate multi-million dollar criminal scheme involving bitcoin and digital gift cards.      Ukrainian citizen Volodymyr Kvashuk, 26, was sentenced in the U.S. District Court in Seattle for 18 federal felonies related to his scheme to defraud Microsoft of more than $10 million. This marks the first case of its kind in the U.S., according to a press release by the Department of Justice.      Kvashuk was involved in the testing of an online retail sales platform for Microsoft from August 2016 until he was fired in June 2018. He had used his employee access to steal “currency stored value” (CSV), namely digital gift cards. He then resold that value online and used the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle including a $1.6 million lakefront home and a $160,000 Tesla car.      What initially began as a small sum of $12,000 in CSV using his own email account access Kvashuk eventually moved to email accounts belonging to other employees in order to mask the growing thefts. Kvashuk then employed a bitcoin mixing service, attempting to conceal the source of funds arriving in his bank account.      “Stealing from your employer is bad enough, but stealing and making it appear that your colleagues are to blame widens the damage beyond dollars and cents,” said Brian Moran, a U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington.      Over a period of seven months, Kvashuk's illegal activity saw a total of $2.8 million in bitcoin transferred to his bank and investment accounts. He then filed fake tax return forms claiming the bitcoin had been a gift from a relative, according to the department's statement and court records.      Kvashuk must now pay more than $8.3 million in restitution – the value of CSV redeemed by third parties who had purchased stolen Microsoft gift cards. The software giant was able to block a further $1.8 million in CSV redemptions totaling more than $10.1 million, according to a court memorandum filed on Nov. 2 in the Western District of Washington.      See also: US Charges 6 With Laundering Mexican Drug Cartel Cash Using Crypto and Casinos      In February, Kvashuk was convicted of five counts of wire fraud, six counts of money laundering and two counts of aggravated identity theft by a Jury. His sentencing concludes a 16-month trial.      The Ukrainian citizen was also convicted on two counts of filing false tax returns, and one count each of mail fraud, access device fraud and access to a protected computer in furtherance of fraud, a court judgment document shows.      ""Kvashuk’s criminal acts of stealing from Microsoft, and subsequent filing false tax returns, is the nation’s first bitcoin case that has a tax component to it,” said Ryan Korner, IRS Special Agent.

BitGo’s status as a qualified custodian should draw more high-net-worth investors to Amber from places like Hong Kong, Taiwan and Seoul, the companies said.      The Hong Kong-based market maker, which has an average daily trading volume between $100 million and $200 million, is building on its existing business relationship with BitGo. (Amber Group’s suite of offerings, which includes Amber Pro and Amber App, have used BitGo security tech since 2018.)      Back in February, Amber closed a $28 million funding round led by Paradigm and Pantera Capital and including Coinbase Ventures. BitGo Trust clients include Pantera, Bitstamp, Nexo, CoinJar and others.      Read more: Crypto Finance Startup Amber Raises $28M in Series A Led by Pantera, Paradigm      Amber’s decision was partly swayed by BitGo’s $100 million in Lloyd's of London–backed cold storage insurance cover, said BitGo’s Nick Carmi.      “The insurance that comes with our trust custody just adds another component of security and trust for the clients – and that’s why they are with us,” Carmi, the custodian’s head of financial services, said in an interview.      Asked for his reasoning on the broadening of the firm’s custody partnerships, Amber Group CEO Michael Wu said via email that it came down to the custodian’s “track record, shared insurance scheme and integration with [the BitGo] lending desk.”    Nimble storage?    Some custodians claim that deep cold storage, which involves some degree of manual processing to get the funds online, is not suitable for the sort of fast turnaround professional trading operations require.      BitGo’s Carmi said the inventory immediately needed for market making and high-frequency trading can be held in hot wallets, or those connected to the internet. “Whatever they are not using stays in cold storage,” he added.      Wu could not comment on the exact breakdown of funds that sit in Amber’s cold wallets at any one time.      “The majority of funds are always being utilized and moved around for various trading, lending and other activities,” said Wu. “Our engagements with new custody partners are driven by business demand as the firm continues to grow.”      Read more: Record $616M of Wrapped Bitcoin Minted in September      Amber has also been getting a taste of BitGo’s wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), a tokenized version of bitcoin (BTC) primed for easy usage on Ethereum’s various decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.      BitGo’s Carmi said WBTC naturally flows into the institutional custody business as savvy investors hunt for yield.      “We are the sole custodians and the only counterparty that can mint WBTC,” he said, “and BitGo Trust is the custodian of the BTC that’s being held for minting.”      Wu could not comment on the volume of WBTC Amber is trading. “We only began trading WBTC recently, primarily as a result of DeFi opportunities,” he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/10/hong-kongs-amber-group-picks-bitgo-trust-in-quest-for-institutional-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67d4d28f30eaa56a0ae46f79345b2bde431a1b7d-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Reporting over $2.4 million in mining revenue, the Castle Rock, Colo.-based mining firm increased revenue by 42% from the same period in 2019. The company's mining revenue clearly benefited from a 15% increase in the price of bitcoin during the Q3 in addition to its increased hash power.  Riot filings show it mined 222 BTC in Q3 2020, up 41% from the same period last year, but slightly lower than the 227 BTC mined in Q2 2020. In 2019, Riot switched to mining bitcoin exclusively, CEO Jeff McGonegal told CoinDesk. Previously, the company also mined litecoin and bitcoin cash.  Riot reported a current mining capacity of 556 peta hash per second (PH/s), meeting its goal set in its Q2 earnings release, which represents a 450% increase from its Q3 2019 hash power of 101 PH/s.  Riot plans to continue aggressively expanding its mining operations, per its earnings report, through four purchase agreements with mining manufacturer Bitmain for a total of 16,600 S19-Pro machines. The firm expects incremental delivery and deployment of its new machines through the end of Q2 2021.  Concurrent with an increase in mined bitcoin and the leading cryptocurrency’s 114% year-to-date rally, Riot’s cryptocurrency corporate liquidity grew from $7.2 million in Q2 to $9 million in Q3. Its cash reserves ballooned from $9.1 million to $30.1 million over the same period.  Riot shareholders enjoyed the lowest quarterly loss per share since the company first fully deployed its cryptocurrency mining hardware in Q2 2018. The loss per share dropped to $0.04 in Q3, a 50% improvement from a loss per share of $0.08during the same period last year.  Riot shares were trading hands at $3.50 at Monday's close, up 32% from the start of Q4. They've risen more than 200% year to date.
