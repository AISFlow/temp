42377296,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70AHF,1400936119,Bitcoin Society CEO: Why Digital Currency is a Tool for Global Good,"The weekend before last week's Bitcoin2014 conference in Amsterdam, 22-year-old Matthew Kenahan had a choice to make – one that he said was “probably one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make”.  Here was his dilemma: attend graduation after slogging for four hard years to get his degree in International Business and Marketing, or skip it to attend the Bitcoin2014 conference, where he and the organization he heads, the Bitcoin Society, were nominated for a Blockchain Award or 'Blockie'.  “I had my 91-year-old grandmother travelling up from Mississippi [to my graduation],” he told CoinDesk. He eventually chose Amsterdam, and was rewarded with not only winning the award for ‘Most Impactful Charity’, but also for ‘Bitcoin Champion’ after Andreas Antonopoulos was unable to accept the prize due to a conflict of interest.    My sincere thanks to anyone who voted for me in the blockchain awards. I apologize for not being able to accept due to conflict of interest      — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) May 16, 2014    Tool for charity  Obviously, Kenahan's ‘problem’ is a lighthearted tale, and nothing like the hard choices faced by people who are living hand-to-mouth in many regions of the world.  In fact, he sees bitcoin as a tool for helping the less well-off and, under his leadership, the Bitcoin Society has sought to explore the charitable uses of bitcoin and to promote a positive image of bitcoin in contrast to its association with the drugs trade.  “The main idea behind this is to show people that you can use cryptocurrency for something other than Silk Road. We're creating a global community, we're trying to connect people,” Kenahan explained  As befits a prize for charitable work, Kenahan pledged to donate his 1BTC winnings to the Women’s Annex Foundation, which aims to build women’s digital literacy and increase access to the Internet. He tweeted confirmation of the donation that same day.  For Kenahan, that transparency in donations is appealing from an accountability point of view:  “[Bitcoin] allows you to create a unique address, for a very specific cause [...] we see both the incoming and outgoing transactions, and we can see that it’s used for a very specific cause.”  Those charitable uses of bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are already apparent from a human rights organization that works in Sri Lanka to homeless outreach shelter Sean’s Outpost in the US.  Perhaps more famously, dogecoin has become a veritable charity fundraising machine, including the $50,000 Doge4Water campaign.  Image problem  More generally, the Bitcoin Society is devoted to challenging what Kenahan calls “misinformation” in reporting on bitcoin and to improving perceptions of bitcoin.  “One of the biggest issues with bitcoin, and one of the things that hindering the development of our community, is we have this fundamental image problem that oftentimes stems from misinformation or slanderous articles,” he argued.  Future plans  As part of that challenge, the Bitcoin Society is planning a number of projects over the next year, including a new website called bitcoincourses.org, which will help to educate people about bitcoin, and a textbook buy-back scheme for US students.  “Instead of selling your textbook back to the bookstore … and getting grossly underpaid,"" he said, ""what we would do is redeem that textbook for bitcoin. That provides a low-risk – it’s money you’ve already spent – way to get involved into a community that has more and more legitimacy every day.”  Currently, Kenahan has big plans for expanding the Bitcoin Society team and is recruiting representatives from his alma mater Washington University.  “We’re going to be set up in Shanghai, New York, India, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago,” he said.  For this self-funded bitcoin champion – Kenahan said he previously traded in the bitcoin markets – 2014 is proving to be a very exciting year indeed.

42395325,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLcS,1400932847,Can Bitcoin Help Predict the Future?,"Fancy taking a bet on bitcoin? Prediction markets are offering people the chance to wager on the virtual currency’s fortunes, among other things – and you can even use your bitcoins to do it.  Prediction markets rely on the wisdom of the crowd, the theory being that people can predict things better when in groups. Although this doesn’t work in some cases (just ask all those who bought real estate during the bubble), proponents say that it has merit, nonetheless.  How prediction markets work  In a typical prediction market, users make a bet, in some form or another. On Fairlay, for example, a user may simply state a prediction, and give odds, and wait for another user to match that bet.  Betting mechanisms can also get quite sophisticated. On sites like Predictious, an event may be created, and then contracts or shares issued in that event. Contracts are paid out only if the event occurs. If you buy a $1 contract in a prediction that bitcoin will reach $2,000 by 1st September, and it happens, then you get your $1 back. If it doesn’t, you lose your money.  On those market-driven sites, you can then trade the contracts you buy, and the market sets the value. The majority of others may not believe that prediction, making it harder to sell those contracts.  You may only be able to sell it for 45 cents, meaning that the market thinks there’s a 45% probability that it will happen. Just as in regular financial markets, the smart money finds predictions that are undervalued, and buys them up in order to cash in later.  In effect, prediction market bets are futures contracts.  These markets can work, say advocates. The University of Iowa runs a prediction market that forecasts presidential election results and claims to outperform traditional polls.  George Mason University ran a predictions market on geopolitical events for two years, and the predictions correlated with real-world outcomes far more than mere chance would allow.  The market uses a Brier score, a statistical method with an output ranging from 0 to 2.  Zero is a perfect, 100% correct prediction, explains Charles Twardy, Research Assistant Professor at GMU. Two is an entirely incorrect prediction. 0.5 equates to no better or worse than a chance outcome. The GMU market averaged roughly 0.2 on geopolitical questions, which is an excellent score.  Cryptocurrency-friendly predictions  Prediction markets are becoming more cryptocurrency-focused in a couple of ways: some of them are beginning to offer specific bitcoin-related predictions, while some are taking bitcoins as payment for bets.  Now, there’s a third, significant development: some people are proposing decentralized prediction markets, in which participants use block chain-based infrastructures to manage the betting.  Last November, GMU launched a prediction market, called SciCast, which focuses purely on science and technology predictions, for example. As of last week it had only resolved four bitcoin questions, with a Brier of 0.49 – slightly better than chance.  On Fairlay, eight in 10 of the prediction events are bitcoin-related, with the remainder focusing on politics and sports.  The fact that prediction markets take their bets in bitcoins in some ways makes the audience self-selecting, pointed out Martin Köppelmann, Fairlay's co-founder, saying:  “We narrowed the events in the beginning to bitcoin-related topics, since, as a bitcoin-only prediction market, this is a natural interest for all of our users.”  Bitcoin is a natural choice for prediction markets, because it’s an easy way of making small payments. It also helps not to have fiat currency floating around in a highly contested industry.  Predictions markets have suffered from regulatory scrutiny before: Irish firm Intrade famously shut down after being sued by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for selling futures contracts. There were also some financial irregularities, alleged reports.  The firm has since said that motivation is necessary for prediction markets to work, and that financial incentives are the best.  “We are thinking hard about replacement motivations, but there is just nothing quite like ‘cold hard cash’,” Intrade explained.  The need for incentives  Incentives are an important part of prediction markets, said GMU’s Twardy.  “Each forecaster starts with a finite number of points, and therefore they have to choose a little more carefully where to spend them,"" he continued.  ""I might have opinions on a lot of things, maybe only a tenth of which I’d be willing to invest my limited points in. It’s a psychological trick to guarantee how I consider how [strongly] I believe in [the prediction]. Economists take this very seriously.”  This also helps to identify those people who really know their stuff, because they accrue more of these points over time, indicating their authority on a subject.  What satisfies Intrade’s call for financial incentives, and the more general need for points that can be easily exchanged? Bitcoin is turning out to be a grand incentive for prediction markets, according to some of the companies operating them.  “It was a good tool to build a prediction market,” says Flavien Charlon, creator of Predictious. “You can bypass banks and set up payments easily.”  The challenge of decentralization  Researchers are interested in other characteristics of cryptocurrencies too – particularly their autonomous, decentralized nature.  The creation of decentralized bitcoin markets will solve some of the biggest challenges facing prediction markets, argues Jeremy Clark, Assistant Professor at the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering. Along with a team from Princeton and the University of Maryland, Clark recently published a long-anticipated paper on decentralizing prediction markets.  “The main goal with decentralization is to remove trust assumptions on single parties,” says Clark. In a centralized prediction market, you would need to let a single party hold money in your account, and to decide on the outcome of an event. You are also trusting it to execute trades in the best way possible.  “Finally the prediction market also gets to choose what markets to open, and what future events you can and cannot bet on.” If you want to bet on something obscure, you can open any event you like in a prediction market.  More than one academic is now exploring the possibilities for decentralized prediction markets using cryptocurrencies. Clark’s white paper suggests creating a new altcoin to facilitate this.  “Bitcoin could just extend their functionality to add this, but traditionally bitcoin has been reluctant to do that. There have been proposals for different extensions that could be used for bitcoin, but they’re very conservative,” he points out.  Another way to do it on top of the bitcoin block chain could be using coloured coins.  Truthcoin and the block chain  Another proposal, Truthcoin, comes from Paul Sztorc, a statistician and Associate in Research at Yale.  In this model, people publish ‘decisions’ on the blockchain, along with ‘states’ (outcomes). People then trade shares in those states on the blockchain. When the event occurs, people get to vote on the eventual outcome of that event, which makes the outcome consensual.  As we move towards decentralized prediction markets, we might escape some of the dangers of decentralized markets, such as the ( probably temporaryhttp://www.intrade.com/v4/home/) disappearance of Intrade, and the concentration of decision-maker power in a single entity.  As to when a decentralized market for trading future predictions will be commercially deployed? That’s a bet we’re not taking money on today.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/24/can-bitcoin-help-predict-the-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fafd6a624d20edbedea1683f16a217be0ed76a3c-1000x668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377292,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70AJl,1400930719,Ireland's BitcoinFRENZY Event Plans Big Bitcoin Giveaway,"Irish bitcoin startup Bitex is to host a fun and informal event in Dublin this June with the aim of introducing more people to the benefits of the digital currency.  Dubbed 'BitcoinFRENZY', the one-day event will feature an introduction into digital currencies, the chance to meet and chat to notable people from the local bitcoin sphere, and a chance to see bitcoin POS machines and a bitcoin ATM in action – both Ireland's first.  Alan Donohoe, who is a founding member of the Irish Bitcoin Foundation and an organiser of the event told CoinDesk the aim of the event is to get the general public active in bitcoin, explaining:  ""Our main aim is to raise the awareness of bitcoin. It's the average person on the street who we need to get using bitcoin. [...] Most ordinary people find the subject a little too technical [...] we will be aiming to provide a simple, no-nonsense approach.""  Bitcoin giveaway  The first 500 visitors on the day will receive a BitcoinFRENZY pack containing, among other goodies, free gift vouchers for amounts of bitcoin varying between 0.25 and 50 euros worth, meaning many people will go away with some cryptocurrency to play with.  Donohoe said that people will be given assistance in setting up wallets for their new bitcoin and should go away with an understanding of how to use it.  To raise awareness of the event, the organisers also plan to deliver bitcoin to around 20 famous people in Dublin – from actors to politicians. Notable names include Irish President Michael D. Higgins, Governor of the Irish Central Bank Patrick Honohan and Bank of Ireland CEO Richie Boucher. The full list is yet to be announced.  Other features on the day will include a raffle with bitcoin mining equipment as the main prize. Donohoe indicated that other prizes could include bitcoin cold storage devices.  Twin events  Indicating that Ireland's cryptocurrency scene is definitely burgeoning, BitcoinFRENZY is not the only bitcoin event to be taking place in Dublin this summer.  The Bitcoin Finance 2014 conference and expo, taking place on 3rd-4th July, will bring together international experts and forward thinkers from across the financial, technological and cryptocurrency spheres.  BitcoinFRENZY will be held on Saturday, 14th June from 12pm to 6pm (IST) at GSMsolutions, 6-7 Abbey Street Upper, Dublin. Entrance is free, however people opting to purchase an optional €10 ticket will receive a second voucher worth the equivalent amount in bitcoin.  Buy, sell, accept  On show at the event will be new-to-Ireland bitcoin POS terminals, which are to distributed by a new company called ViviPOS.  The terminals work via Wi-Fi and GSM, can scan users' wallet QR codes and print paper wallets, vouchers and invoices. They also work with Coinkite's bitcoin debit cards.  As well as working as point-of-sale terminals for accepting payments, they can also be used to buy and sell bitcoin, effectively making them a mobile exchange too.  Ireland's new bitcoin platform  Hosting the event is startup Bitex, a bitcoin service company that will launch next month with the aim ""to bring every service and every bitcoin product imaginable to Ireland"", said Donohoe, adding:  ""It will be Irelands first bitcoin exchange, similar to Bitstamp but with public offices. Bitex has quite a number of software and hardware products in development and will release each as they are completed.""  Effectively, the company plans to bring many bitcoin-related businesses together under one umbrella company.  ""We will rival Circle to a certain extent"", explained Donohoe. ""We have built our services and customer base from the ground up from day one. The bitcoin community is what we really care about and the true freedom bitcoin represents.""  Bitex says it has received a six-figure investment in the first quarter of 2014, which is being been used to develop services. It expects further investment opportunities in the coming months.  Although Bitex is a wholly owned Irish company, representatives met with MoneyGram last week regarding an application for regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. The hurdles for FCA regulation are lower than with the Central Bank of Ireland, Donohoe said, but that is the company's next step.

42377276,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70A3P,1400928936,Bitcoin Holds Big Promise for Charity but Hasn't Delivered Many Big Gifts,"Aislinn Wish Leoncio-Apilado is a baby in the Philippines who needs a liver transplant. Miguel Cuneta, a bitcoin entrepreneur in the country, wanted to help.      Cuneta, co-founder of payment services startup Bitmarket.ph, had already successfully raised enough in bitcoin donations to buy 20 boats for fishers who lost their livelihood in 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan. Anxious to demonstrate again bitcoin’s potential for doing good, he helped Aislinn’s family set up a bitcoin wallet and spread the word on a Facebook group and reddit. Soon 3.4BTC had come in, delighting the family. He said:      “Raising money in the Philippines takes a lot of hard work, and the money we raised for them in three days would have taken much much longer, or taken much more resources to pull off.”              The donations averaged around $30 each – amounts that would hardly have been worth collecting if international money transfer fees had been necessary. But with bitcoin, all the money went directly to the family. The experience gave Cuneta a vision of how cryptocurrency could transform philanthropy:      “I imagine a time when instead of Facebook likes or retweets, you can send $1 or even 10 cents to a worthy cause, as easy as pressing one button. No other technology can do this.”              And yet, the bitcoins raised represent only a small fraction of Aislinn’s need. The operation – which she must have within one to two years to survive – will cost nearly $100,000.    Prospects for bitcoin philanthropy    It’s an apt depiction of the current state of bitcoin charity. The potential exists for a mighty river of bitcoins to flow directly to those in need, all over the world, but right now the flow is more of a trickle.      There are a handful of success stories. Sean’s Outpost, the Florida-based project where bitcoin donations – some 200BTC in 2013 – feed the homeless and have helped get some off the street; the BitGive Foundation raised $5,000 in bitcoin in one day for Save the Children, and is now halfway through raising $10,000 for The Water Project; and there's even the somewhat ad-hoc success story of the sports fan who held up a sign at a televised football game and received 22 bitcoins, the bulk of which he has promised to donate.      Altcoins have seized upon charity as an opportunity to raise their profile, with dogecoin raising money for the Jamaican Bobsled Team and, fittingly, shiba inu rescue. NobleCoin, Worldcoin and others have also organized fundraisers.      But considering that bitcoin is an investment that has nearly quadrupled in the past year, and that “bitcoin millionaires” are now a high-profile phenomenon, one would think they’d give more than a few bitcoins here or there.      The BitGive Foundation would need to raise $100,000 to ramp up with a full-time leader, said founder Connie Gallippi, but so far it has been able to raise only about a tenth of that, most of it right after its inception a year ago. So Gallippi leads the foundation in her spare time when she’s not working as a fundraiser and lobbyist for the California Urban Forest Council in Sacramento.      “We have a steep hill in front of us to make this happen,” said Gallippi, who was inspired to start a charitable foundation for the bitcoin community after attending Bitcoin2013 in San Jose. She originally went to see her brother, Tony Gallippi, who was manning a booth for the company he cofounded, BitPay.    Donations dipping    Some charities that initially saw a bitcoin boom are now seeing fewer gifts come in.      Last year, bitcoins made up nearly 10 percent of the $375,000 budget at Songs of Love, a New York City charity that writes and produces personalized songs for sick children. But founder John Beltzer said he hasn’t gotten a bitcoin donation in a month.      “It's slowed down,” he said.      One theory on the slowdown is that bitcoin investors feel less flush, since – after surpassing $1,000 in late 2013 – the dollar value fell to the current $400-$450 range.      Gallippi speculated that the bitcoin industry is simply too young to divert large sums to charity. Many of the early bitcoin buyers who made bank are pouring their gains into startups now, she said:      “Most people are in a position where they are bootstrapping, they’re starting their business, and they may have taken their own bitcoin holdings to do that.”              Other companies, she said, are running on investor dollars, which they aren’t free to donate:      “If you look at some of the pioneer bitcoin companies, they have money, but it’s investment money. They have staff they need to pay, they have promised return on investments.”              BitPay donated 1BTC as a matching gift to the BitGive Foundation’s campaign for The Water Project, which provides safe drinking water in Africa. The company also processes bitcoin donations for charities free of charge. BitGive has received about $20,000 worth of in-kind donations, notably pro-bono legal work from San Francisco firm Perkins Coie, Gallippi said.      Donations from the cryptocurrency world might not be growing as fast as some had hoped, but interest from the charity side is coming along, stimulated by the undeniable advantages that bitcoin offers fundraisers.    Potential for bitcoin charity    Like Aislinn and Songs of Love, charities and people in need are realizing that accepting bitcoins can open up donor pools for them that they would not reach otherwise without international marketing operations.      “You're exposed to the entire world,” said Dmitry Murashchik, treasurer for Bitcoin100, an organization that encourages charities to accept bitcoin by offering them $1,000 in the currency if they add a bitcoin collection button to their website.      Bitcoin100 disburses the payments from a fund it collected mostly in its first year (2011); it currently has 92BTC. While donations have slowed, requests from charities have increased, with about 40 signing up in the past six months, Murashchik said.      Forward-thinking nonprofits are also excited about the opportunity to raise funds without losing large chunks of the money to international transfer fees. This would not just save money, but could give charities much more freedom to operate in innovative ways, wrote Peter Chasse, president of The Water Project, in a manifesto titled ""Welcome Cryptos"":      ""Today, small grants are too expensive to send. Large grants are too risky to release to untested partners. I'm looking forward to lower/no cost transfers that could allow us to work with more of the smaller, less tested, but promising local water advocates. I imagine having our program team work with a growing indigenous team by transferring incremental and limited funds, 'just-in-time,' to complete discreet tasks. We've learned that building trust and accountability is much easier that way.""            Risks and vulnerabilities    Like businesses, nonprofits are attracted to bitcoin because of its promise for fraud avoidance. Charities sometimes receive gifts from stolen credit cards, which end up getting reversed and costing the organization in fees, Murashchik said.      Funds are especially at risk of fraud when being transmitted to beneficiaries in the developing world, Gallippi said:      “Every time it changes hands, it’s open to fraud, and almost every time, that’s what happens. You could be donating to somebody, and the money will never even get there.”              Of course, bitcoin has its own fraud vulnerabilities, such as theft by hacking. Bitcoin donations have been scrutinized as possible thefts before, but charities would likely not even know if money donated to them had been stolen, Murashchik said.      “There's no way to prove it, and there's no way to pull the money back out. Somebody might have donated stolen bitcoins to us – there is no way of knowing,” he said.      Bitcoin enthusiasts have also explored innovative ways to give to the needy. One example is by donating mining cycles. Bitcoins For Charity connects miners to charities through its website, and says it has raised 900BTC for the Free Software Foundation and more than 3,800BTC for WikiLeaks.    Beneficence without borders    Perhaps the greatest goal for innovation in bitcoin charity is the dream of being able to transmit money person-to-person, across the world, with a mere click of a button. Theoretically, it’s already possible – but only if both the sender and recipient have a bitcoin wallet and the means to turn bitcoins into goods or services they need.      The BitGive Foundation is working with 37Coins, the startup that transmits bitcoins via SMS, on a plan to fulfill bitcoin’s potential for across-the-world giving, said Gallippi:      “Our long-term goal in a partnership with 37Coins or similar technology would be direct giving where you can send money to an individual as a donation, but it’s going through a charity for a vetting process. You’re not just blindly sending a bunch of people in Africa money, but you know someone has identified who they are and there’s some kind of check and balance. It’s definitely possible.”              Some are already experimenting with this approach. GiveDirectly, the nonprofit that transfers funds directly from donors to impoverished people in Kenya and Uganda, now has a Ripple wallet so that donors can send XRP.

42377293,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70AL1,1400924606,"How Roger Ver Got Hacked, and What He Did to Stop it","More details are available on last night's hacking and identity theft attempt on Roger Ver, with the bitcoin icon and his security team revealing how they tracked the hacker and forced him into a humiliating backdown.  The story became more compelling when Ver posted a 37.6 BTC reward on his Facebook account to anyone who supplied information leading to the hacker's capture.  He stressed that everything was now back under control and that no amount of bitcoin was stolen.  What was later described as a series of hack attempts by an individual or ""a few kids"" working together began around noon local time in Singapore, where bitcoiners were attending this week's Coin Congress event.  A few of Ver's friends contacted him to say someone appeared to be impersonating him on Facebook, and was soliciting bitcoin donations.  ""A few hours later I noticed some notification emails regarding an old old hotmail.com account that I haven’t used for much of anything for years,"" he said.  ""Hotmail doesn’t seem to offer 2FA, so the hacker seems to have successfully accessed the Hotmail account by answering the security questions based on publicly available information.""  Ver had not been such a public figure at the time he'd set up the account.  Using Hotmail, the hacker/s retrieved sensitive personal information, ID document numbers and even login credentials to one of Ver's domain accounts at register.com.  Skype contact  Someone using the Skype account 'nitrous' with screen name 'Savaged' contacted Ver at 5:24pm and confessed to being the person who'd hacked into his email.  Displaying hacker bravado, 'Savaged' posted Ver's Social Security Number and some other information to prove his sincerity.  ""All I want is some bitcoin and I will leave you alone,"" Savaged wrote, promising to return the stolen accounts and not continue with attempts to infiltrate Ver's online life any further.  Otherwise, he would ""ruin"" Ver's life and cause hardship to his family back in the US.  ""I think we both know this won't be pleasent (sic) and let's be honest there is nothing you can do to have me caught, I've been around too long.""  The hacker demanded 37.63289114 BTC for his troubles, equivalent to $20,000 at the exact time, saying such an amount was ""nothing"" to someone so wealthy.  Rallying the troops  Ver's go-to guy in Singapore to deal with the crisis was J. Maurice, a fellow bitcoiner from Tokyo and 'Chief Hacking Officer' of company wiz technologies. Both Ver and Maurice happened to be staying at the Shangri-La Hotel, also the conference venue, and Maurice dashed across the building to start work immediately.  Together they began mitigating the damage by identifying accounts that hadn't been touched and trying to lock them down more securely.  Using the information they'd gained from Hotmail, the hackers were trying to hijack Ver's domain names and primary email account. They reset the password on an older, disused, Facebook account.  Maurice transferred the domains' nameservers to his own network at wiz technologies but within minutes, the hackers simply changed them back again. He eventually had to transfer the domains completely away from the compromised account.  They also tried to track down details about the hacker/s, identifying a number of Twitter accounts that appeared to be controlled by the same person.  Crowdsourcing  Just after 6:00pm Ver decided to employ the tactic used by Mel Gibson's character in the movie 'Ransom': Rather than give the bitcoins to the hacker, he posted on Facebook and Twitter that he would use the same amount as a bounty on the hacker instead, and mentioned the Skype name 'nitrous'.    37.6 BTC reward for information that leads to the arrest of the hacker that is trying to hack all my stuff at the moment. details to come!      – Roger Ver (@rogerkver) 23 May 2014    The promise was even re-tweeted by celebrity financial commentator Max Keiser to his 99,300+ followers.  Inspired, several of Ver's thousands of Facebook friends and followers leapt into action, posting pieces of information they claimed were the hacker's and offering teasers of further information once the bitcoins were paid.  There was a Skype exchange with someone named 'TGOD' who claimed to know the hacker personally and had a personal grudge against him, but seemed impatient to get his hands on the 37.6 bitcoin reward and was not prepared to offer up any information before it was paid in full or part.  Ver at no point advocated any violent or physical action against anyone suspected of connection to the hack.  Change of Heart  Around 6:30pm, about an hour after the incident began, the hacker's tone started to change. Irritated by a lack of immediate response he first became abusive and threatened with ""WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET OWNED LIKE X10000 HARDER THAN I PLAN TO?""  He then switched to pleading, saying he'd demanded the amount to pay for a $15,000 transplant procedure for his mother.  Ver then sent a link to his Facebook post with the offer of a 37.6 BTC bounty. Thereafter the hacker appears to panic, switching to frantic apologies and claiming to be representing a separate, 'real' attacker.    ""Goodbye. Sir, I am sincerely sorry I am just a middleman I was being told what to. I was seriously being told what to tell you by someone else I don't even know what's going on.""      ""Please stop I am so sorry I told him that you are now going to have me killed over something he made me do I didn't even do this it was someone else.""    ""Then you can earn 37 BTC by turning in the real hacker,"" wrote Ver.  ""Man that isnt even me this is so fucked up i got myself in this situation[...]You dont know the stuff he makes me do he did this to me before.""  The chat ends with the supposed hacker capitulating completely, saying he would probably turn himself in to the authorities voluntarily for fear he'd be harmed as a result of the incident.  The hacker/s then deleted Ver's Hotmail account, set all passwords to his other accounts to a racial slur, notified Ver of the change and vanished.  He/they also tried to delete the threats made via Skype, but Maurice fetched the chat logs and posted the incriminating sections online.  Aftermath  Ver's followers on Facebook identified people they suspected of being the culprit, though at this point it has not been verified that any of them are the hacker in question.  As for the 37.6 BTC bounty, Ver said:    ""I will gladly pay it when the hacker is arrested, to whatever person provided the information that led to the arrest.""      ""If more than one person helped, I will split the reward between them in whatever ratio I think is the fairest.""    Ver has posted full chat logs from the Skype conversations with the hacker and bounty hunter. He added Microsoft has still not responded to a support request he made regarding the Hotmail hack and account deletion, even though it was over 24 hours ago.  Securing your online properties  Maurice said it was important for everyone to be more security conscious with all the internet properties they controlled, not just bitcoin:  ""The important takeaway here is that because of the fact register.com doesn’t support 2FA, the hackers almost gained access to Roger’s primary email, where they could have potentially compromised the majority of Roger’s accounts.""  ""This also shows how important it is to protect your DNS infrastructure. If you haven’t already, I highly recommend moving your domains to a registrar that supports 2FA. I’m currently using name.com simply because they were the first to support 2FA, but I’m planning to move my domains to namecheap because they not only support 2FA but they also accept bitcoin.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/24/how-roger-ver-got-hacked-and-what-he-did-to-stop-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65e36b5bc9f54a3e33c32d00962c7cd2154744e0-1000x652.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
