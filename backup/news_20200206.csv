42403954,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh75v,1581027343,'95% Confidence': Ethereum Developers Pencil In July 2020 for Eth 2.0 Launch,"Ethereum’s next system-wide upgrade, Eth 2.0, won’t launch in Q2 2020 as expected, but researchers remain confident the initial network parameters will deploy in 2020. Anything less would be considered a “failure,” they said.      In an “Ask Me Anything” Reddit discussion held Wednesday, the Eth 2.0 team said the network won’t launch until three clients can run testnets consistently for a minimum of eight weeks. AMA participants included ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Eth 2.0 researchers Danny Ryan and Justin Drake.      ""I have 95% confidence we will launch in 2020,"" Drake wrote.      Eth 2.0, the next iteration of the world’s leading smart-contract blockchain, promises higher transaction throughput and a new security model under Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Often called Serenity, Eth 2.0 has been in the works since ethereum’s launch in 2015 but has been slow to get off the ground due to the highly technical nature of the endeavor.      The launch for Eth 2.0 was first slated for January 2020 and then an undisclosed date in Q2 2020. Developers are now eyeing the network’s fifth anniversary, July 30, 2020, for Eth 2.0’s debut.  “Phase 0 will certainly launch in 2020. Audits are out and testnets are getting stronger every week,” Ryan said in the discussion thread. “I don't see a reality in which Phase 0 does not launch in 2020.”      Ryan and Buterin said they believe Eth 2.0 could deploy Phase 0, the Beacon Chain, which acts as a general manager of Eth 2.0’s PoS system, on only two stable clients. Other Eth 2.0 researchers are opting for a more conservative approach, however.      At the time of ethereum’s debut in 2015, the Parity client launched after Geth, leading to the validator set swinging disproportionately toward the latter client, at an 80-20 tilt, Drake said. “Parity never managed to catch up with Geth,” he added.      Regardless of the launch date, Phase 0 and Phase 1 are 99 and 90 percent complete, respectively, Ryan said. Phase 1 will link ETH holders who have staked their assets to the Beacon Chain, joining the ribs to the backbone of the new network.      Third-party code audits and testnets – such as a lite client capable of being run on an Android smartphone demoed by Ethereum developer Nimbus on Tuesday – remain the outstanding tasks, Eth 2.0 researcher Diederik Loerakker said.    Spring cleaning    The coming months should also feature one major update for ethereum coin holders looking to participate in Eth 2.0’s launch: staking contracts.      As a PoS network, asset holders are rewarded for pledging their coin holdings to protect and validate the network. Eth 2.0 will require 32 ETH, currently valued around $6,400, to participate as a validator.      Contracts for staking ether (ETH) are under audit with an announcement expected this spring at a major ethereum event, Ryan said. The team said the number of validators could run into the millions with one researcher claiming up to 10 percent of ether’s supply, which has a current market cap of $23 billion, could be staked on Eth 2.0.      Finally, the Eth 2.0 team continues to examine how to package the current ethereum network, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network, into Eth 2.0.      Dubbed “Eth 1.5”, two options have been proposed: transitioning Eth 1.x into “stateless clients,” as detailed in a December blog post from Buterin, or merging Eth 1.x into the Eth 2.0’s Beacon Chain “as is.”      In short, the current ethereum blockchain can either be trimmed into digital receipts proving the authenticity of old PoW transactions or Eth 1.x can work within Eth 2.0 through interoperability bridges until the new chain is fully built out.      As Buterin noted, the former option – digital receipts – seems to be “the way the wind is blowing.” Still, significant challenges remain such as the “technical viability” of stateless clients and the “megabyte-size blocks every 13 seconds that they would entail,” Buterin said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/06/95-confidence-ethereum-developers-pencil-in-july-2020-for-eth-20-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53fc4552206e786ffa225a8f84f00eed5ed91590-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now, according to Jordi Puigneró, Minister of Digital Policies and Public Administration, Catalonia is also angling for digital independence.      ""Just as the Internet brought us universal connectivity, blockchain will bring us new universal governance. It will affect the administration [of government], will affect the economy, and it will affect one thing which is very important in our society: trust,” he said. “Trust is what moves economic transactions and it’s what moves the relationship between the citizens and their government.”      Puigneró said blockchain tech provides an opportunity for Catalonia to establish a model of self-sovereign identity.      “That’s actually one of the projects we’re launching in Catalonia, which is to have a self-sovereign and digital identity because we believe that it is very important that the monopoly of identity is not exclusive to the state,” he said. “We want to give power to the citizens or empower the citizens in a way in which they can handle better the privacy of their data. It's also good for them to prevent the Big Brother concept. We don't want our citizens to feel like they're living in Big Brother State.”      The next goal is to make Catalonia a high-tech hub.

42403962,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh7Dn,1581019192,How Blockchain Will Track Taxes (and Tax Cheats),"Tomicah Tillemann is the chairman of the Global Blockchain Business Council and, at Davos this year, he was interested in taxes. He spoke to Michael Casey at his council's event at the World Economic Forum.      “We were really fortunate yesterday to announce a new collaboration with Ernst & Young and MIT. Together with New America, my organization, we're going to be working together to tackle the very tough challenge of tax around the world,” he said. “Tax, obviously, is on its face about the most boring topic imaginable, but it turns out that it powers many of the most fundamental elements of our lives.”      Tillemann and his team are looking to make tax systems more efficient, transparent and accountable.      “So we're working on three big challenges. First, how do we make it simpler and more fair to get taxes from citizens and companies into government? That's a big struggle in many countries. So how do we simplify that process and create a fair playing field where everybody is paying what they should and [not] more than they should?” he said. “The second piece of this is how do we ensure that once those resources are inside the government, they're used effectively? And then the last piece of this is how we engage in the storytelling work around this effort to make it all understandable and coherent for citizens and corporate partners. It's a lot of work.”      Tillemann sees taxes as a cornerstone of civilization.      “The [U.S.] Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said that taxes are the price we pay for living in a civilized society, and in a moment when civilization is looking a little bit shaky,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/06/how-blockchain-will-track-taxes-and-tax-cheats,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae450137d6a795b22e198c17fae1df271b9d7f03-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Open interest, or the number of open futures contracts, rose to $13 million, surpassing the previous record high of $12 million reached on Feb. 3, according to data analytics firm Skew.      Open interest has risen sharply, by 13.6 percent from $5.5 million to $13 million over the past two weeks. Open positions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's bitcoin futures also jumped to a five-month high of $249 million on Wednesday – up 34.5 percent from $185 million seen two weeks ago.      Bitcoin's price has risen by 19 percent since Jan. 24. The cryptocurrency printed a high of $9,775 on Wednesday, a level last seen on Oct. 28.      Analysts keep track of changes in open interest to gauge the strength of price moves.      An uptick in price along with a rise in open interest indicates there is strength behind the move higher. A trend is said to be lacking substance when the two metrics move in opposite directions.    Bakkt volumes decline    Meanwhile, trading volumes in Bakkt futures have been in a declining trend since hitting a record high of over $44 million, or 6,601 BTC, on Dec. 18.

42403952,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh74w,1581004828,SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Proposes 3-Year Safe Harbor Period for Crypto Token Sales,"SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce wants to give legitimate crypto projects a shot at success without running afoul of U.S. securities laws.      The two-year official at the Securities and Exchange Commission – nicknamed “CryptoMom” by the blockchain community – has formally proposed a safe harbor for token projects. It would give them some breathing room to develop their networks and communities before having to worry about the regulatory regime.      Under Peirce’s proposal, unveiled during a speech at the International Blockchain Congress in Chicago Thursday, crypto startups would have a three-year grace period from their first token sale to achieve a level of decentralization sufficient to pass through the agency’s securities evaluations, including the Howey Test, the famous U.S. Supreme Court assessment.      To date, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against a number of companies that created and sold tokens, including Telegram and Kik, two major messaging platforms.      “The analysis of whether a token is offered or sold as a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the digital asset,” according to notes detailing the proposal.      In other words, some tokens may appear to have the qualities of a security at launch but mature to the point where it no longer appears to be one.      Ether, the native token of the ethereum blockchain, may be one such example: SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman, speaking on his own behalf and not the agency’s in June 2018, said ether by that point did not appear to be a security. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton later appeared to endorse this view, writing that digital assets could at some point no longer be investment contracts (though he did not mention ether specifically).      Notably, Hinman suggested ether may have begun its life as a security but its network evolved in subsequent years.      A similar transition was also seen with EOS. The SEC settled charges with the company last year, saying the original ERC-20 EOS token was a security, but the project's final EOS token was not (holders migrated from the ERC-20 token to a native version after the network was fully built out).      “The application of the federal securities laws to these transactions frustrates the network’s ability to achieve maturity and prevents the transformation of the token sold as a security to a non-security token functioning on the network,” Peirce said in notes detailing the proposal.      Safe harbor    Peirce has floated the idea of a safe harbor in the past, but Thursday's proposal is the first formal attempt to make it a reality.      If adopted by the majority of the SEC’s other commissioners, it would create a strict set of requirements for crypto projects to raise funds through a token sale, including requiring personal disclosures, code disclosures, public notices and a number of other factors.      “The safe harbor is also designed to protect token purchasers by requiring disclosures tailored to the needs of the purchasers and preserving the application of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws,” according to Peirce’s notes.      Specifically, the proposal defines an “initial development team,” which will manage the network’s development over its first three years, and “network maturity,” referring to a network that is “not controlled and is not reasonably likely to be controlled” by a single entity or individual but is operational.      The development team should disclose “the names and relevant experience, qualifications, attributes or skills” of each member, as well as how many tokens each member holds and how many they may earn through founders' rewards or similar programs.      “The definition of Network Maturity is intended to provide clarity as to when a token transaction should no longer be considered a security transaction but, as always, the analysis will require an evaluation of the particular facts and circumstances,” the proposal states.      At the end of the grace period, the initial development team will have to determine whether token transactions constitute securities transactions. The team should look to create liquidity for the token by securing secondary trading markets (which remain compliant with applicable money transmission and consumer protection laws) on top of their development efforts.      ""Admittedly, the liquidity condition may surprise observers of SEC staff positions in which attempts to facilitate secondary trading have been viewed as indicia of a securities offering,"" Peirce said during her speech. ""In the context of the safe harbor, by contrast, secondary trading is recognized as necessary both to get tokens into the hands of people that will use them and offer developers and people who provide services on the network a way to exchange their tokens for fiat or cryptocurrency.""      Also in an effort to bolster consumer protection, Commissioner Peirce’s proposal would require a token project’s source code, transaction history (and a description of how an individual can independently search transaction history), token economics, roadmap and a history of past token sales all be disclosed on a free and publicly accessible website.    Good faith    The safe harbor proposal is dependent on development teams acting in good faith, Peirce said.      It would not be available to any teams with members who are already disqualified ""as a bad actor under the securities laws"" due to past actions.      Moreover, while the proposal would preempt any state securities laws, it would not protect projects from any enforcement actions taken due to fraud or other illicit activities.      ""SEC enforcement has played an important role in combating fraud in connection with token sales,"" she said. ""The safe harbor would not provide immunity from such actions.""      Nor does Peirce's proposal imply exclusivity; projects can still operate under existing federal securities laws such as Regulation D or S or other valid exemptions under the law.      The proposal would also not likely apply to projects that are already operational, Peirce said. Her goal is to focus on new projects in their initial stages of development so as to ensure they can move beyond their first steps in building a network or community.      ""This bad actor provision is not directed at teams that set forth a plan for a network and work earnestly toward building it, but fail to bring it to fruition. Rather, it is designed to ensure that the SEC can bring suit against a team that sets out to defraud token purchasers by materially misrepresenting or omitting key information,"" Peirce said. ""We all know that there are plenty of those kinds of 'projects' polluting the crypto space.""

42403969,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh7Kg,1581004811,Blockstack's New Consensus Mechanism Creates New Use Case for Bitcoin,"Blockstack is giving its long-term holders a new way to earn bitcoin.      Announced Thursday, the decentralized-web startup is rolling out a consensus mechanism that essentially presents a fresh use case for the world's most popular cryptocurrency.      When version 2.0 of Blockstack's Stacks blockchain comes out, miners on the network will need to post BTC to mine a block. That BTC will then get shared with nodes maintaining a copy of the ledger.      ""We accept bitcoin as the most secure blockchain in the world. We accept a world where this will continue to be the case,"" Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk in a phone call.      The Stacks blockchain, which aims to put user data in the hands of users, is designed so apps can be built without central data storage. Apps can point to where to look for user data, and these pointers are stored on the Stacks blockchain. STX tokens are needed to participate in the chain.      To prevent spamming, or Sybil, attacks, all cryptocurrencies require some cost for writing new blocks. Bitcoin did this first by essentially requiring miners to spend electricity to participate, with its Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. By requiring miners to buy bitcoin and turn that over to the network to participate, Blockstack thinks it has found an ample cost to help prevent malicious entries.    How it works    Called Proof-of-Transfer (or PoX in the new Blockstack white paper describing the mechanism), the new consensus protocol has two kinds of participants: miners and stackers.      ""PoX can help to solve a bootstrapping problem for new blockchains,"" the white paper states. “Participation rewards in a separate, potentially more stable, base cryptocurrency can be a better incentive for encouraging initial participation than offering participation rewards in a new cryptocurrency.”      Miners write blocks and earn STX tokens in exchange for their BTC – at a rate of 500 STX per block. That BTC will be distributed among the stackers, who will be keeping a copy of the blockchain and also voting on which version of the chain miners should mine on.      Blockstack distinguishes this new approach from Proof-of-Stake (PoS) because node participants don't have to put any of their assets at risk to participate, beyond the opportunity cost of agreeing to lock up their STX for some set amount of time.      ""Proof of Transfer is a proposed design that uses Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) to launch new blockchains that are anchored in Bitcoin’s security,"" Blockstack wrote in a blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance. ""Further, PoX can give incentives to earn Bitcoin rewards to participants of such new blockchains. Such Bitcoin rewards were not possible before PoX. These rewards can potentially be used for use cases like consensus participation, ecosystem developer funds, incentives for specific players, etc.""      To serve as a stacker won't be cheap, though. It will take roughly $10,000 in STX to participate, Ali said, but like other chains with similar arrangements users won't need to actually have that much. They can delegate to a service that maintains the node, in exchange for agreeing to lock up STX in collaboration with the node operator.      Tezos has this with its “bakers” and EOS has effectively turned staking eos to vote for validators into a money-making proposition as well, as we previously reported.      What's new with PoX, though, is participants in the network locking up the native token don't earn the native token for doing so. They earn BTC.      ""I think the market and the entrepreneurs are starting to recognize that bitcoin is the strongest computing network in the world and therefore you can build things on top of it,"" Anthony Pompliano, partner at Morgan Creek Digital, told CoinDesk.      But, given the rough outline of the proposal, Pompliano wasn't sure the bitcoin community would get behind it.    What’s in it for miners?    Mining the Stacks blockchain will be possible with a normal internet connection and computer, Ali said. Miners will just need to watch the price of STX and the price of BTC to assess whether continued participation fits their risk profile.      ""In our process of mining, the miners can model PoX mining as almost as an exchange,"" Ali said. This should have some sort of arbitrage advantage early on but if all goes well that difference should shrink as participation increases, he added.      Miners’ income opportunities will also go up when Blockstack is ready to release its smart contract language, Clarity. Once miners activate it, they will start earning smart-contract fees. Ali argues Stacks may be attractive for developers looking to use smart contracts because they will be able to get extremely precise cost estimates for their code.      Blockstack will not participate in mining. The current plan, Ali said, is that once 20 miners activate the new version of the software, Blockstack 2.0 will go live. Miners will continue to have the ultimate decision about upgrades on the network.      The current version of Stacks operates atop bitcoin with the vision to eventually migrate out as its own PoW chain. This completely changes with version 2.0.      ""With this thing, we basically need to never migrate from bitcoin,"" Ali said.

The researcher posted a description of the attack, which he named ""Purge"" after the B-movie franchise, to the bitcoin developer email list last week. It's a variation on the so-called sabotage attack, in which malicious miners try to wreak havoc on bitcoin for the sake of wreaking havoc, rather than for profit.      “Purge attacks probably don’t constitute a bigger risk than other known forms of sabotage attacks, but seem like an interesting spin,"" he wrote.      In the dystopia of the ""Purge"" films, the U.S. government legalizes all crime for one night every year to unleash a sort of national catharsis. Hasu said he chose the name ""because the attacker doesn’t (primarily) steal money himself, he makes theft legal in the network for a short period of time.""      In short, the attack opens the possibility that in very particular circumstances some users could spend their bitcoins more than once, something the unique technology behind bitcoin is supposed to prevent.      To be clear: The scenario is hypothetical, like many others bitcoin researchers have identified in their efforts to steel the network against real-world sabotage attempts. Anticipating the danger is a first step toward preventing or at least mitigating it.      Undermining trust    In order to execute a purge attack, a rogue miner would replace an already accepted block with an empty one, pushing transactions that were previously seen as final back into the ""mempool,"" which is like a waitlist for transactions. Then, anyone who sent a transaction during that time can spend the same coin twice.      The new type of sabotage could be used to ""undermine trust in bitcoin's assurances,"" such as the assurance that transactions are after a time ""final,"" meaning irreversible. ""Possible attackers could include nation-states hostile to bitcoin as well as terrorist organizations,"" Hasu added.      Further, Purge is different from other sabotage attacks because the users who are suddenly allowed to double-spend could get incentive to go along with the attack.      ""Because Purge gives normal users a way to benefit from the attack, the attacker hopes that it will be harder to coordinate a response quickly because whoever benefited from the attack has an incentive to defend the attack chain,"" Hasu told CoinDesk.      But while Purge is a new idea, it’s not necessarily worse than other known attacks. Hasu also points to a couple of lines of defense: One, the risk to the attacker of losing block rewards, which are expensive to win and could decline in value if the attack shakes confidence in bitcoin; and two, the “strength of bitcoin’s pre-coordination.”  The full report (on bitcoin futures exchange Deribit's blog) dives into much more detail.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/06/crypto-researcher-hasu-flags-attack-that-could-bring-purge-style-mayhem-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b554acb9e82c7b796113e0739ea83aa96899ee60-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Harry Moseley, a technologist with an eclectic career who is now Zoom’s chief information officer, sat down with CoinDesk’s Michael Casey to talk about the product and the future of the decentralized workplace.      His first point is that talent isn’t evenly distributed. The only way to hire, he says, is to hire remotely.      “We have more jobs than we have people. It’s hard to attract talent where you operate. It's really hard, and has been hard for years,” he said. “How do you collaborate? How do you connect people in a geographically distributed workforce?”      “That's where Zoom plays a significant role because, as we all know, it’s not just the words, it's the tone. Most importantly, it's body language. If we all had our preferences, we'd rather meet together in a room. But that's not possible.”      In this video, Moseley also discusses the recent Zoom security breach that exposed some users to potential hacks. His goal? To never let it happen again.      Further, he believes there are trade-offs involving security, regulation and privacy. Each has to be taken into consideration.      “You have to be careful about the balance between security versus privacy versus regulation,” Moseley said. “If you have regulation it often goes too far to the right and then the big tech companies will be blocked from innovating,” he said. “And then there's also the perspective that you can put great technology in place from a security perspective. But then you have to change behaviors. You've got the millennials, you’ve got more senior people. Their experiences change in their security profile.”      Check out the rest of the videos shot at the World Economic Forum in Davos here.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/06/zooms-cio-sees-a-rise-in-the-decentralized-workforce,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a69b8338f34cb62cd772f811cb1a303d4df5812-2560x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking during Intercontinental Exchange’s Q4 earnings call Thursday, Jeffrey Sprecher said the company’s pending acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions, which will ultimately be acquired by the bitcoin warehouse, “will accelerate the second phase of our digital asset strategy.”      “We began by building a regulated bitcoin custody solution as well as regulated futures and options on bitcoin,” he said. The second phase includes a consumer-focused digital payments app Bakkt first formally announced in October.      “The next big hurdle for the company will be getting that app into consumer hands and we will be looking at consumer adoption more than revenue or expense,"" Sprecher said. ""Fortunately, that company is not a big drain on us … we have a lot of financial flexibility now from the company given it has a revenue stream both from trading and from operation of all these rewards programs.""      Users will be able to manage and transact with airline miles, hotel points, cryptocurrencies and other assets on a single platform, he said. Bakkt is also looking to digital gaming assets as a potential new aspect.      “We’ll position Bakkt as an aggregator and marketplace for these points,"" he said.      Bridge2 already supports 4,500 loyalty and incentive perk programs, Sprecher said, and supports products for seven of the top 10 financial institutions in the U.S.      Sprecher told Fortune Magazine that “the legacy payments infrastructure is ripe for disintermediation.”      He envisioned Bakkt’s app as “a direct payment system” not dependent on services provided by other third parties. “It hit us that making rewards cash-like would be a step in that direction,” he said.      Bakkt anticipates launching the app in the first half of 2020.      The company is also continuing to raise funds and build out its products. In a press release Wednesday, ICE said Bakkt is looking to close a new funding round in the coming days.      During Thursday’s earnings call, ICE CFO Scott Hill said Bakkt was included in a bucket of ICE’s anticipated expenses for the fiscal year, as the company expects to spend $20 to $30 million in technology and operations.

The TRON Foundation announced Thursday that Sun met the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway for dinner, at Buffett's suggestion, at a private country club in his home city of Omaha, Neb., on Jan. 23. Sun brought several guests including Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, eToro CEO Yoni Assia as well as the CFO of Huobi, Chris Lee, and head of the Binance Charity Foundation, Helen Hai.      In a statement after the dinner, Sun said it ""was really an honor and I’m grateful for Mr. Buffett’s dinner, wisdom and vision.""      He added that he would ""take Mr. Buffett’s advice and guidance to make TRON a better ecosystem, business with all the partners in the blockchain space and beyond,"" though he did not provide specifics.      Buffett has auctioned off a dinner with himself every year since 2000, with participants' funds directed toward charity. Sun placed a record-breaking $4.5 million bid at the Glide Foundation last year.      While his dinner had been originally scheduled for late July 2019, Sun postponed days before, claiming to have fallen ill with kidney stones.      A Chinese media outlet reported the day after the dinner's postponement that Sun was under investigation by local authorities and was not allowed to leave China, though Sun later appeared to be in San Francisco in a video live stream.      He later apologized for ""over-marketing"" the dinner, claiming it had had ""a negative influence"" with regulators and the public.      Buffett has been highly skeptical of cryptocurrencies, once famously referring to bitcoin as ""rat poison squared."" Although TRON declined to comment on what was discussed over dinner, Sun had originally said he hoped the meal would “bridge the gap between institutional and traditional investors and the realm of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.”      During the dinner, Buffett reportedly said that he didn't see any value in bitcoin because he believed that only businesses created value, Assia told CoinDesk. He also said that Buffett believed bitcoin was not a store of value but a ""store of fear"" because investors buy it out of ""fear of what happens in the short term if the markets crash.""      ""He [Buffett] thinks that blockchain technology has value but that none of the companies out there right now are using it correctly. The smartest people say it’s an important technology, just no one really uses it yet,"" Assia added.      Buffett's assistant did not immediately return a request for comment.

42431496,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2xbh,1580990415,"Fed Reserve Is Researching DLT-Based Digital Dollar, Says Governor","The Federal Reserve is looking at whether launching its own digital currency could be an effective counter to private initiatives such as Libra.      Lael Brainard, who sits on the U.S. central bank's board of governors, said Wednesday the Fed is ""conducting research and experimentation related to distributed ledger technologies and their potential use case for digital currencies, including the potential for a CBDC [central bank digital currency].""      “By transforming payments, digitalization has the potential to deliver greater value and convenience at lower cost,” Brainard said in a speech delivered at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in California. The U.S. dollar's global importance means the Fed needs to ""remain on the frontier of both research and policy development” regarding digital currencies, she added.      But the Fed has to evaluate if the technology would make payments safer and reduce operational costs, and whether it presents whole new risks to the financial system, Brainard warned.      Working with the private sector, U.S. officials would have to determine ""whether new guardrails need to be established, whether existing regulatory perimeters need to be redrawn and whether a CBDC would deliver important benefits on net,” she said.      Brainard had previously waved off any suggestions the Fed might launch its own digital currency. In May 2018, she told an audience at a cryptocurrency conference in San Francisco that ""there is no compelling demonstrated need for a Fed-issued digital currency.”      But the Fed's softening stance toward digital currencies may be in response to concerns surrounding privately administered digital currencies. In her speech Wednesday, Brainard said the surprise release of Libra last summer ""imparted urgency to the debate over what form money can take, who or what can issue it, and how payments can be recorded and settled.”      “Some of the new players are outside the financial system’s regulatory guardrails, and their new currencies could pose challenges in areas such as illicit finance, privacy, financial stability and monetary policy transmission,” she said.      Central banks have been showing an increasing interest in digital currencies. Some, most notably the People's Bank of China (PBoC), have already moved into active development.      A Bank for International Settlements report last month found more than 10 percent of banks surveyed could issue a digital currency within the next three years. Just last week, the National Bank of Cambodia said it planned to launch its own CBDC sometime in the fiscal quarter.      Six central banks including the central banks of the U.K. and Japan, as well as the European Central Bank (ECB), formed a working group in January to collaborate and share research relating to CBDCs. It was reported Thursday to be holding its first meeting in April.      Although the Fed has not joined the working group, Brainard said in her speech the U.S. central bank was already ""collaborating with other central banks as we advance our understanding of central bank digital currencies.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/06/fed-reserve-is-researching-dlt-based-digital-dollar-says-governor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/035c7ba7361ab9ef6265cfcfea8edb546bfbcd34-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431487,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2xJh,1580989104,Fidelity's VC Arm Leads $13M Series A for Blockchain-Based  B2B Network Clear,"Clear, the provider of a settlement system that uses blockchain to facilitate cross-border B2B trading, has finalized a $13 million Series A investment round.      The Singapore-based startup said Wednesday the round had been led by Fidelity's investment arm, Eight Roads (formerly Fidelity Ventures). The venture subsidiaries of telecommunications companies Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom, Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) and Singtel also participated in the round.      Clear says it can reduce friction in complex global business trade, which was valued at $150 trillion in 2018, with blockchain technology. There is an ""unbelievable amount of friction"" in B2B trading, said co-founder Eran Haggiag, and that allows banks and other middle-men to collect fees amounting to over $140 billion a year.      A Clear spokesperson added: ""The amounts enterprises spend on processing these payments, managing the contracts around them, checking data and invoices each month, deploying and managing the software to support them is a few times the cost of those fees, costing trillions globally each year.""      The startup believes it can save global commerce a good chunk of that expenditure by using an interoperable technology stack that can cut through all these friction-inducing processes. It's said to be able to automate data management, payments and clearing to reduce transaction fees and human error, and offer instant cross-border settlements.      A smart contract layer can also speed conflict resolution processes so they can take place on an ongoing basis rather than at the end of the month, as is currently the case.      In order to encourage as many companies as possible to use Clear, the platform can support and operate on multiple blockchain protocols, the spokesperson said.      Although the company has plans to be integrated across a wide range of industries, Clear has initially focused on the telecoms sector where, since 2018, it has facilitated sales cumulatively worth millions of dollars between multiple mobile and network providers.      Highlighting that blockchain added a new layer of trust to its operations, Guenia Gawendo, Telefonica's chief innovation officer, said the company could use Clear to ""significantly decrease friction in the processes of financial settlement between carriers and operators.""      HKT Group Managing Director Susanna Hui said the Clear integration could prove ""immensely important"" for creating new products and services with the rollout of 5G network capabilities. ""Enterprises can now push boundaries and allow faster innovation and faster go-to-market of products and business models,"" she said.      Clear plans to use its investment to expand its 30-strong team and telecoms operations.

42431491,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2xVh,1580985150,New Central Bank Group to Discuss Digital Currency Benefits at April Meeting: Report,"In mid-April, the chiefs of six central banks as well as the Bank for International Settlements (BiS) will hold a meeting in Washington to discuss the potential creation of their own digital currencies, according to a report from Nikkei.      The planned meeting would be the first by the group formed last month amid growing concerns among financial authorities about the rise of regulated digital fiat currencies, most notably Facebook’s Libra and China's digital yuan.      In January, central banks from the U.K., Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Japan and the EU formed the working group with BIS to further study the application and feasibility of central bank digital currencies (CBDC).      The central bankers plan to discuss how digital currencies could streamline international payments, and will also look at security measures that might be required, according to the report.      ""It's quite natural to consider how to make international transactions more convenient,"" Masazumi Wakatabe, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, told the publication Wednesday.      China is currently closest to launching a CBDC among the major nations, with the People's Bank of China reportedly testing its digital yuan. That has prompted other central banks, including the U.S. Fed Reserve, to start looking more seriously at the possibility, in part to avoid falling behind China if it launches a globally used digital fiat that might rival the dollar's international status.      Top officials of the six banks will prepare their findings on CBDCs before the leaders meet in April at the sidelines of an international conference in Washington, according to Nikkei.      The group aims to have an interim report ready for June and a final report in the autumn.      In late January, a Bank of Japan official said if advances in payments technology are quickly made, there may be more demand for a central bank digital currency. As such, it's “very important” the bank should lay the groundwork of the technology and be ""prepared to respond.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/06/new-central-bank-group-to-discuss-digital-currency-benefits-at-april-meeting-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49d042850d035db1d3d1ba0c97a5fc9c5bf170c8-1500x923.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431502,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2xph,1580981442,"Bitcoin's Uptrend Is Gaining Steam and Many Altcoins Are Surging, Too","View    Bitcoin bulls pushed prices to fresh three-month highs above $9,700, reinstating the bull view aborted by a doji candle earlier this week.  The indicators on the daily and weekly charts are signaling strong bullish momentum.  Bitcoin could test the psychological resistance of $10,000 in the near term. Pullbacks, if any, could be short-lived.    While bitcoin's rally has gathered pace in the last 24 hours, other major cryptocurrencies have put on a better show.      Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, found bids near $9,100 during the Asian trading hours on Wednesday and rose to a fresh three-month high of $9,755 during the late U.S. session.      The convincing break above $9,600, a level from which bitcoin turn lower earlier this week, has revived the immediate bullish view aborted by Monday’s doji candle.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,615, representing a 4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      The crypto market leader, however, is outshone by other top 10 alternative cryptocurrencies (or ""altcoins""), according to CoinMarketCap.      For instance, ethereum’s ether (ETH) is currently reporting a 9 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s offshoots bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) are flashing double-digit gains, and litecoin (LTC) and EOS are up at least 5 percent each. XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, is up just 0.75 percent.      Notably, ETH is trading well above $200 for the first time since September and has gained 63 percent so far this year. Other top coins such as LTC and EOS are reporting 78 percent gains on a year-to-date basis. By comparison, bitcoin is underperforming with a 34 percent gain.      Some lesser-known names including ontology (ONT), Qtum (QTUM), and waltonchain (WTC) have also risen more than bitcoin since the start of the year. As a result, bitcoin’s dominance rate – its share of the total crypto market value – has dropped to a seven-month low of 65 percent.      The Intermarket performance is suggestive of a bitcoin rally that is, in part at least, being fueled by increased demand for alternative cryptocurrencies.      Most of them are denominated in bitcoin. So investors tend to buy bitcoin first and then rotate the money into alternative coins, causing bitcoin’s price to rise relative to the dollar.      From a technical perspective, bitcoin’s rally looks to have legs and further gains could be in the offing. That could only bode well for broader markets.    Daily chart    Bitcoin jumped 5 percent on Wednesday, engulfing the price action observed in the preceding seven days and a sign bullish sentiment is quite strong.      Further, it closed (UTC) Wednesday above the lateral resistance of the Nov. 4 high of $9,586, establishing yet another bullish higher high.      Lastly, the cryptocurrency convincingly breached Monday’s high of $9,615, invalidating bull fatigue, signaled by that day’s doji candle.      All in all, the bulls look to have reinstated their dominance and could soon challenge the psychological resistance of $10,000.      Notably, there is no major resistance lined up between the current price and $10,000 that could cap upside. The 14-day relative strength index is still holding below 70, meaning the market isn’t overbought and there is room for further price gains.      Dips, if any, could see support at the ascending, or bullish, five- and 10-day averages currently placed at $9,412 and $9,396, respectively.      The overall bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above the higher low of $8,213 created on Jan. 24.    Weekly chart    Bitcoin witnessed a bearish channel breakout four weeks ago.      The MACD histogram is now beginning to print higher bars above the zero line – a sign of the strengthening bullish momentum. The RSI is also hovering in the bullish territory above 50 and pointing north.      Overall, the odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to the October high of $10,350.

42431484,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2xHh,1580958000,Germany's BaFin Clarifies Licensing Process for Foreign Crypto Custodians,"Germany’s Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) is clarifying how the country’s new cryptocurrency custody law will apply to firms that operate outside of Germany but still serve the German market.      In its latest guidance released in January, the regulator said firms already custodying digital assets for Germans would not be penalized for not having a license. Instead, they’d be grandfathered into the same protection that crypto custody firms based in Germany already have under the new law, which went into effect on Jan. 1.      This means those firms must also announce their intent to apply for a license by March 31 and apply for the license by Nov. 30. It also means crypto firms that hadn't been custodying crypto for German customers before Jan. 1 but are interested in expanding into the German market cannot do so until they have received a license first.      “Nobody has the ability to apply right away, which is why we have these grandfathering mechanisms,” said Carola Rathke, partner at Eversheds Sutherland Germany, a firm that is working directly with BaFin on how the law should be enforced.    Setting the record straight    At the beginning of 2020, BaFin published an application form that is non-binding, meaning firms are not required to use the form. The most recent guidance also makes clear firms should be submitting a “complete application” by the Nov. 30 deadline – meaning the regulator has no questions about the application. Crypto firms should plan to apply long before the end of November, Rathke added.      Germany drafted the law in response to the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), which requires crypto firms to demonstrate compliance with enhanced know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) procedures. While firms familiar with German financial regulation are already drafting applications, the industry is at the mercy of whatever guidance BaFin releases over the next several months.      The process may be jarring for firms that aren’t used to dealing with the German regulator.      “This is exactly the way it works: They make a law quickly and then find out that it is not very clever, and now after the law is out they establish administrative practices,” said Sven Hildebrandt, head of Distributed Ledger Consulting Group, which has been advising crypto firms on how to navigate the complexities of the German regulatory system.      “I believe there is enough guidance out there that if you know what you’re doing then you know what to do by now basically,” he added.      Hildebrandt estimates that guidance will start to appear as the result of specific applications in the next three to five weeks. Hildebrant’s DLC Group is now trying to get approval from BaFin to serve as the compliance arm of companies that can’t afford to apply for the license themselves.      Still, there are parts of crypto custody that aren’t addressed by the law – like custody that takes advantage of multi-party computation, Hildebrandt said.      Certain parts of the law will also need clarity over time. For instance, firms applying must have a German branch with directors who are “fit and proper,” but defining what makes a manager in crypto right for the job could be difficult. It’s likely the regulator will require a manager with banking experience in addition to having a manager with technical blockchain experience, Rathke said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | WALLET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/06/germanys-bafin-clarifies-licensing-process-for-foreign-crypto-custodians,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36a068b9ff3156dcafd60dad8259b3a299d34c69-1500x883.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over the course of eight hours, starting at 10:00 UTC on Feb. 5, the price of BTC rose 5.9 percent from $9,250 to around $9,775 before a small sell-off ensued that brought prices back to current levels at around $9,559.      Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of U.K. crypto firm BCB Group said the recent moves in BTC were likely due to shallow market depth amplifying buyer bids.      “Any meaningful size still rocks the boat while the background bullish drivers are the usual suspects with the upcoming halving,” Landsberg-Sadie said.      Still, the impact to BTC’s latest price rise could also be attributed to activity in the altcoin market.      Su Zhu, co-founder at Three Arrows Capital, said the price movements were being led by large-cap altcoins, especially ether (ETH).      “There were some statements from the [Commodities Futures Trading Commission] that ether futures would be coming before the end of the year and some positive technological progress has been recently achieved on both the ethereum base layer as well as the progress to ETH2.0,” Zhu said      The seven-day short-term change in ETH’s price is up 18.5 percent alongside XRP, which is beginning to pull BTC higher; bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) are up 17.6 and 12.9 percent, respectively, over a 24-hour period, Messari data shows.",POSITIVE,BCH | ETH,ALTCOIN | BCH | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/06/bitcoin-rises-above-9700-to-reach-highest-point-in-3-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25ed19611cc1794c0d39715cabfb08f70cab124d-1428x596.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
