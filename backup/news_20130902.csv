42425055,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqIHh,1378137736,KnCMiner cuts price of Saturn and Jupiter bitcoin mining rigs,"KnCMiner has cut the price of its mining rigs by as much as 28%, with the Saturn now on sale for $2,995 and the Jupiter for $4,995.  The company also revealed today that the Mercury bitcoin hardware miner has been discontinued (this previously came with a price tag of $1,995).  All orders placed from today will be delivered from mid-November, but existing orders will be shipped no later than 15th October.  Miner nameOld priceNew pricePrice decreaseSaturn$3,795$2,99521.1%Jupiter$6,995$4,99528.6%Mercury$1,995DiscontinuedN/A    Sam Cole, co-founder of KnCMiner, said the company decided to cut the prices after covering its non-recurring engineering costs and deciding it would like to pass on the cost savings to its customers.  When asked whether he thinks some of the company's existing customers, who paid the higher price for their rigs, would be annoyed that the prices had been cut, he said: ""There is a one-month shipping gap between the last order going out of the existing sales (15th October) and the new deliveries at the reduced price (mid-November) so we don’t think people will be too annoyed.""  KnCMiner's latest update said those who haven't yet placed an order may still have the chance to get their hands on miners that are in the batch set for October delivery:    ""There currently exist a few unpaid orders which are marked for October delivery. If these orders remain unpaid, they will become available for purchase again, unless payment is received.      The devices will then be added back into our site on a daily bases. The same procedure will also be in place for refunded orders. So keep an eye on our site for any October deliveries.""    It goes on to suggest existing customers will go to the top of the queue when the company releases new bitcoin mining devices.  New slogan chosen to be printed on PCB  KnCMiner's  original Mars PCBs carried the phrase: ""Bitcoins make the world go around!"". Given this grammatical faux pas, the company decided to offer its followers on the BitcoinTalk forum the opportunity to choose the new slogan for its controller boards.  On Friday (30th August), KnCMiner selected the winning slogan, which it hasn't revealed yet.  ""We won’t release the winner or the slogan until we have the boards in hand. There are a few other nice surprises on the boards for you all to see when they ship,"" Cole said.  Here are some of the suggestions that KnCMiner liked, but didn’t quite make the cut:  Commanderuk – Difficulties mastered are opportunities won.  600watt – Mine the Gap.  Kaerf – “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks”  The joint – where zeros and ones become heroes and fun.  The Avenger – “A dream you dream alone is only a dream.

42425070,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqIfh,1378123725,Avalon's ASIC customers offered bitcoin refunds due to delivery delays,"Avalon has retracted its no-refunds policy after announcing delayed delivery of its ASIC chips.  The company said in an email update that the delays were caused by events beyond its control, but added that customers who placed their orders before 1st June can request a full refund (in bitcoins) if they desire.  It goes on to say it is receiving a batch of more than 400,000 chips on Wednesday (4th September) so expects to be able to meet the deadlines for orders made in June or later.  ""In addition, we hope to wrap up generation one, finish shipping the chips, construct the modules and build the 2 module Avalon mini, put this pre-order mess behind us in general and switch gear into 55nm production, tape out generation 3, and start work on improving chip design for generation 4,"" the company’s email states.  Avalon had suggested earlier last week that full refunds would be offered. On 28th August, BitcoinTalk forum member BitSyncom, who represents the Avalon, said: ""We are shipping as per usual … and are doing the best we could but probably simply going to offer full refund soon, I am tired of this toxic community malformed by greed.""  Many of Avalon's customers are not satisfied by the company's decision to offer refunds. Several have voiced on BitcoinTalk that they feel they should be offered compensation, either in the form of bitcoins or additional chips.  ""At this point it isn't 'toxic malformed greed' from the community. Forget profits – it's people desperate to even have a chance of getting close to breaking even. Prior to this, delays on units only diluted profits. Now the delays are costing people more and more money,"" said forum member Kartaiv.  AdamKD used stronger words in suggesting Avalon has both cheated and alienated the community that developed around its product. He went on to say he doubts people will trust the company again after its failure to fulfil promises.  However, forum member zefir suggested he still has faith in the company:  ""Until otherwise proven I personally give them the benefit of the doubt and assume things went wrong outside their control. Sooner or later we all will know what happened.""  This isn’t the first time Avalon customers have experienced delivery delays. Back in March, the company sent an email to its customers informing them that batch two deliveries were going to be delayed: ""We are unfortunately going to be late. This should not be too surprising as the delay from batch one will no doubt carry over.""  Despite past delays, many Avalon customers seem to be pleased with their purchases, with forum member silverserpent praised the company for the ""rock solid packaging"" and ""quality and durability"" of his new bitcoin mining rig.  ""This has to have been the toughest and proudest purchase/investment I have ever made – it really feels good to be part of something that is so powerful and evolutionary in the world today,"" he added.  Avalon competitor Butterfly Labs has faced significant criticism over late deliveries. For example, the Jalapeño – the company's first-generation entry-level miner was delivered to customers more than 6 months late.  What do you think about Avalon's refund offer? Is it enough?",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/02/avalons-asic-customers-offered-bitcoin-refunds-due-to-delivery-delays,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7a2dcedfb3438d949805e45fe86f939ebbaf120-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
