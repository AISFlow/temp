42426879,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxOXh,1463612018,Judge Dismisses Mt Gox Class Action Lawsuit in Canada,"An effort to bring a class action lawsuit against defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox has been dismissed in Canada, according to a notice posted by Charney Lawyers PC today.  Launched in 2014, the class action sought to recover damages plaintiffs lost in the exchange’s collapse, an effort that continues in the US. Now, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has ruled that claims against Mt Gox Inc, Mt. Gox KK, Tibanne KK, Mt Gox North America Inc, Mizuho Bank as well as Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and founder Jed Mccaleb will not proceed.  Sources close to the lawsuit report that the bid proved unsuccessful due to Mt Gox’s bankruptcy filing in Japan, which was honored by domestic courts last year.  An effort was launched following the decision to keep the lawsuit alive, however, that will officially end on 17th June when the action will be formally dismissed.  Plaintiffs seeking restitution from the exchange are now free to mount individual lawsuits against parties involved in the class action, subject to limitation periods on such actions that bar lawsuits from commencing after a certain length of time following the inciting incident.  In Ontario, where the lawsuit was launched, plaintiffs, for example, have two years to file a lawsuit in attempt to receive restitution.  Mt Gox collapsed in February 2014, losing a reported 744,400 BTC, a sum of assets that was then valued at $350m.

42426888,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxOph,1463604946,Public Opinion Split As The DAO Rakes in Ethereum Funding,"The DAO has become the talk of the digital town since its launch less than a month ago. With nearly $150m worth of the cryptocurrency ether raised to date, the unusual organization has inspired both passionate supporters and skeptics.  In the past week, numerous headlines and op-eds have emerged on the subject of The DAO, (distributed autonomous organization) with everyone from bloggers to social media outlets to major media publications weighing in. Opinions ranged from unblemished support to critical takes on the big questions surrounding the project.  Overall, supporters of the project say The DAO ushers in a new mechanism for funding projects and individuals that might otherwise be ignored by the venture capital ecosystem. Further, they say it represents a radical method for reshaping the digital economy, while providing a powerful example of Ethereum's technology in action.  Critics aren’t as convinced. While acknowledging its novelty, some have taken issue with several aspects of The DAO, including lingering questions about intellectual property rights, economic incentives and how existing regulations on securities and investment will come into play.  This feature looks at a slice of opinions on The DAO that, while by no means represents the totality of voices weighing in today, offers a a range of perspectives on the project.  Positive points  Some observers struck a far more optimistic tone in their assessment of the project since its launch, including investor and TechCrunch contributor Seth Bannon.  In an article entitled ""The Tao of 'The DAO' or: How the autonomous corporation is already here"", Bannon reckoned that the concept could open the doors to more people to take part in what he called ""the innovation economy"".  ""By allowing economic cooperatives to be spun up with a line of code, and by allowing anyone on the Internet to become owners of these organizations, DAOs may allow more people than ever before to fully participate in and benefit from the innovation economy.""  In his piece, Bannon – who suggested the concept could one day evolve into a scenario in which Google-sized DAOs operate autonomously – echoed other observers, including critics of the concept, by highlighting its experimental and unpredictable future.  He wrote:  ""This is [a] new frontier, and the list of unknowns goes on. What does this mean for the future of corporations? The future of VC? While it could certainly be a profitable and successful endeavor itself, The DAO is in many ways a grand experiment in a new form of economic cooperation. Many of the unpredicted benefits and unexpected kinks will be discovered by this first pioneer.""  Bannon perhaps summed up the sentiments of what many are feeling about the project by saying, “It will sure be fun to watch.”  Swedish Pirate Party founder and cryptocurrency supporter Rick Falkvinge wrotehttps://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2016/05/dao-old-world-really-cant-comprehend-new-world/ that criticisms about The DAO's leaderless nature are wrong, stating that those who make such claims are missing the point.  ""What the old world fails to see is that there is leadership, there is a business plan, and there’s a clear investment idea. It’s right in front of them. They just fail to recognize it as such: The source code,"" he wrote. ""The source code makes the decisions for all to see. The business plan is right in the source code.""  Falkvinge went on to write:  ""The fact that Wall Street doesn’t recognize source code for perfectly valid, validatable, and transparent business logic is why Wall Street is being left behind.""  He argued that ""the exact same thing"" happened with bitcoin, pointing to the digital currency's early days as an example of the kinds of criticism being levied against The DAO.  Negative notes  Other observers took a more negative stance toward the project. Perhaps some of the most-discussed comments came from an essay by Dan Larimer, founder of BitShares and one of the originators of the concept of DAOs.  In a widely circulated piece, he argued that his experience with that project should be borne in mind as those backing The DAO await the end of the creation phase and the first funding proposals.  Larimer argued that he believes problems will not surface in the immediate term, but that eventually The DAO participants will run up against issues of human nature itself.  He wrote:  ""It might not happen at first, but over time the Ethereum community will learn the hard way what the BitShares community has already discovered. Creating social systems to jointly fund development of projects and investments is challenging. Ultimately, technology can only aid in communication, it cannot fix the fundamental incompatibilities between individual self interest and community decision making.""  According to Larimer, attempts within the BitShares community to effectively accomplish The DAO's mission, including raising funds and allocating vote-tokens to organization participants, ran into headwinds that he argued could crop up in the future.  Low voting rates were one such issue.  ""One of the first things we learned from BitShares is that the vast majority (90%+) of stakeholders did not participate in voting,"" wrote Larimer. ""This is due to the fact that voting requires time, energy and skills that most investors lack. How many people have the economic, technical and entrepreneurial skills to vote responsibly?""  Larimer also argued that the project could run into trouble in regards to concerns over the value of ETH, and what disbursing tokens to Contractors – entities that effectively work for The DAO via smart contracts – could do to the price in the short term. This issue, he said, created problems for BitShares community members that, ultimately, colored the process of voting on proposals for the worst.  ""Unable to bear the short-term paper loss and psychological impact of a lower market cap, people started electing proxies that would vote against all spending proposals,"" he wrote. ""With The DAO, the same principles are at work.""  Mixed feelings  Lastly, some commentators offered mixed criticism and praise, in at least one instance going on to propose suggestions in an attempt to help improve The DAO.  Speaking with Forbes contributor Laura Shin, Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer reckoned that the project ""is not operating within our existing legal framework"".  ""Some protections that are give[n] to investors that take the shape of 600 pages of regulations do not exist for distributed autonomous organizations, but on the other hand, DAOs have the benefits of algorithmic control and algorithmic restriction,"" he told the publication. ""For example, with the DAO, I can restrict how much the executive of a Kickstarter-like fund gets paid. I can simply say this is how much overhead they will get, and it is transparent and I can check it after the fact.”  Preston Byrne, chief operating officer of blockchain startup Eris, offered his own take on the project. In his piece, Byrne compared the legal structure of a typical company with that of The DAO. He drew issue with the legal structure of the organization itself – a fact he argued would prove to be ""fatal"" for the project.  ""#THEDAO might look and feel like a company, but on cursory examination, too many gaps, too few formalities, not enough structure and legally incorrect methods reveal themselves as fatal to the exercise,"" he wrote.  Far from calling for the abandonment of the project, Byrne reckoned that the project needs ""lawyering"", as well as what he believes to be two steps needed to put The DAO on a sustainable path.  ""Two things need to happen – quickly – to put this right (and these are just starting points),"" he wrote. ""The first is to get a formal structure involved. The second is to abandon the token sale and utilize legally compliant funding structures.""  Byrne continued:  ""Why address funding? Because the practice of selling blockchain tokens as an investment over the internet – as THEDAO is doing – while not new, is a big problem. Hundreds of cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitshares, Swarm, and Omni/Mastercoin, to name a few) have come and gone since 2013 which have used ""token sales,"" ""software licenses,"" ""crypto-equity,"" ""cryptofuel,"" or other artifices to raise funds from unaccredited investors. Unfortunately, this practice is against the law.""  Byrne reiterated his argument that The DAO would benefit from a more formal legal structure, effectively creating an ""automatic backbone to a bona fide, properly structured, equity crowdfunding business"".  ""It’s perhaps more boring when we do it that way. It takes more work. It takes much more time. It means not cutting corners,"" he wrote. ""But at the end of the day, not cutting corners is very much its own reward.""

42426882,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxObh,1463596712,Nasdaq Explores How Blockchain Could Fuel Solar Energy Market,"During a demonstration at Nasdaq's global headquarters today, the stock exchange operator unveiled a service that lets solar power generators sell certificates using its Linq blockchain service.  The solar panels are connected to the Internet with technology provided by Filament, a Nevada-based blockchain startup that has raised $6m in venture capital to build technology that allows traditional electronic devices to be connected online.  Through an API pull from Nasdaq's blockchain-based private markets platform Linq, anonymous certificates are created and can – in theory –subsequently be sold to anyone who wishes to subsidize solar energy.  Despite a bug or two during the live video feed, the cryptographically verified certificate, representing solar power generated in the western US, appeared live on the screen in New York City. In interview after the event, Alexander Zinder, senior director of global software development for Nasdaq, explained how the technology powering the use case works.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The solar panel is actually hard-wired into the IoT device through a converter which enables us to measure the wattage they’re putting out and producing into the grid.""  The project is part of collaborative effort between Nasdaq and design firm IDEO's CoLab to facilitate partnerships that take a design-based approach to creating human-usable technology.  ""We think it’s a very compelling use case,"" said Zinder, who also helped develop Linq as part of the exchange’s effort to make stock sales more efficient.  He added:  ""There’s a lot of opportunity, but it’s extremely early in our exploration.""  Solar and blockchain  Elsewhere in the blockchain space, applications related to decentralized energy distribution have been gaining steam.  Brooklyn-based startup LO3 recently demonstrated technology that allowed one New York resident to generate solar power and sell a certificate for that energy to his neighbor.  In Vienna, Grid Singularity is following a similar model using blockchain applications. At CoinDesk's Consensus 2016 blockchain conference earlier this month, Australian startup Sun Exchange was a startup contest finalist for its platform that lets investors back small-scale solar projects and receive monthly dividends.  As for when Nasdaq's project might be ready for market, Zinder says the CoLab team began work earlier this year and ""put it together very quickly.""  But it would be a while before any commercial product evolves out of that process, he later cautioned.  Following a panel discussion at the event, Zinder told attendees:  ""There’s always potential for that, but nothing concrete right now. We’re exploring.""

42426883,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxOfh,1463585716,‘Blockchain Revolution’ Comes to Wall Street at Nasdaq Event,"The father and son authors of the new book ""Blockchain Revolution"" took to the stage this morning where Nasdaq opens and closes its market to discuss their latest work.  Kicking off a panel discussion with several industry leaders, Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott took turns discussing how the management structure of some of those very same companies could be disrupted by distributed ledger technologies like blockchain.  The elder Tapscott set the stage for the conversation with a point-by-point explanation of why he believes blockchains can do to the management structure of companies what bitcoin and other applications are doing to value exchange.  Don Tapscott described the bigger-picture impact:  ""This surely will have an impact on the firm.""  Coincidental timing  On the same day ""Blockchain Revolution"" hit stores, a distributed autonomous organization called TheDAO would also launch its crowdfunding campaign. Given the leaderless, autonomous nature of the project and the impressive capital it has raised, it was a topic of conversation at the day's event.  According to Tapscott, the reason The DAO was created is because its structure provides the most efficient way for its creators to minimize transaction cost.  Citing Nobel prize-winning economist Ronald Coase, Tapscott argued that until now the structure that best facilitated that process was vertically integrated, which generally speaking means a leader overseeing other leaders who oversee entry-level employees.  But with smart-contract enabled management infrastructures, supporters of ""The DAO"" argue this structure can be flipped on its axis and managed horizontally.  As an example of the types of services that may one day be delivered under this management structure, Tapscott invoked the business models of some of today's leading Silicon Valley startups.  Tapscott mentioned that blockchains could enable the creation of what he called a ""super Uber"" or ""bAirbnb"" (blockchain Airbnb).  He suggested the technology that powers The DAO could also reshape the music industry to the point where musicians ""could they be fed first, and enable the labels to work on there behalf"".  Doubting DAOs  Overall, Tapscott expressed skepticism about the likelihood that The DAO's fundraising round might be a fluke.  ""Is this some kind of weird truth or is this some kind of harbinger of change for a rethinking of the firm?"" he asked.  The DAO can be thought of as a tightly packed collection of smart contracts that help facilitate everything from taking on new voting members to the allocation of resources. While this is the first widely successful application of the technology, its core code is open-source, meaning anyone can copy it and try the model — or something similar — for his or herself.  Since The DAO exploded onto the blockchain scene earlier this month, many sceptics have come out to counter the support of investors.  Yesterday, FT Alphaville published an article about potential problems pertaining to token sales in exchange for voting rights that looks remarkably like an IPO. It also noted the long history of difficulties when one transfers ""all day-to-day decision making to amateur committees"".  The author of ""The Naked Corporation"" and ""Wikinomics"" paraphrased Bob Dylan’s""Ballad of a Thin Man"" to sum up the coincidence of the simultaneous launch of his book and The DAO.  Quoting a famous lyrical passage, he said:  ""Something is happening here, but you don’t know what it is.""  Replacing Rube Goldberg  Don’s son and co-author of the book, Alex Tapscott, also talked about the impact of blockchain on traditionally problem-solving and its historically vertical structure.  The current financial services industry, he said, has a long history of solving problems top-down with new ideas tacked on top of other new ideas built on older new ideas.  Alex Tapscott described the problem to the financial industry:  ""You end up in many aspects with this Rube Goldberg-style machine.""  By building solutions into an interlocking network of blockchains, Tapscott argued that financial innovators can create more resilient, less unwieldy solutions.  Book reception  The Tapscotts' book has been largely well-received by members of the media. But it is also just one of several books to have been released on the subject over the past month.  William Mougyar's ""Business Blockchain"" was published by Wiley on 9th May and Chris Skinner's ""ValueWeb"" was published on 7th April.  At today’s event, the authors of ""Blockchain Revolution"" were introduced by Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, who talked about her skepticism toward some members of the media when she was first approached by the Tapscotts.  After realizing what Masters described as the ""sheer scope"" of the book, she agreed to participate.  Addressing an audience filled with industry insiders, Masters explained what she saw as the real books' real value:  ""Everybody knows enough to have been at least somewhat seriously confused.""

42426887,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxOjh,1463582157,On Blockchain Disillusionment and Bitcoin's Big Bad Wolves,"Beneath the headlines, there’s arguably been the early stirrings of a sea change in the blockchain industry. There’s a new trough of disillusionment, but this time its those working with blockchain applications, not bitcoin, who are being affected.  Described as the period in a hype cycle where interest wanes as experiments fail to deliver, the term was first used in the industry as bitcoin’s price declined in 2014 amid overinflated expectations about its use in e-commerce. Now, the innovators in the ecosystem seeking to apply blockchain technology for use by financial incumbents are showing the first signs of a similar frustrations.  The spinning of the tires on such attempts perhaps hasn’t been audible given that, while bitcoin’s problems were and still are largely public, the institutions experimenting with blockchain have done their best not publicize those struggles.  Still, there has been a noticeable change in tone among those working close to such efforts.  For all the investment, it remains increasingly unclear exactly how banks will use blockchain technology or distributed ledgers, or if the areas where it seems most effective will be lucrative or interesting enough for incumbent financial firms to pursue.  As noted by Coin Sciences CEO Gideon Greenspan in a recent CoinDesk opinion piece, shared ledger efforts have hit a roadblock when it comes to confidentiality, as every institution operating in such environments today sees every transaction.  ""This turns out to be a huge issue, both in terms of regulation and the commercial realities of inter-bank competition,"" Greenspan writes. ""While various strategies are available or in-development for mitigating this problem, none can match the simplicity and efficiency of a centralized database managed by a trusted intermediary.""  Elsewhere, Matthew Spoke, one of the leaders of Deloitte’s Rubix project, an effort aimed at advancing the use of distributed protocols, wrote an opinion piece in which he hinted at the inherent ironies of how blockchain is being positioned as a complementary, cost-cutting technology for financial institutions.  Spoke went so far as to question whether the blockchain industry’s softening of the comparably more alarmist rhetoric of bitcoin innovators properly represents the technology and its potential impact.  ""If it is still the case that the technology could pose an existential risk to some companies (which I would argue it is), then how can these same companies justify the focus and investment they are likely already putting into blockchain technology?"" Spoke asked.  Such public musings come at a time when rumors persist that some major financial institutions are cutting back on investments in blockchain tech, while members of R3CEV’s blockchain consortium allegedly publicly voice issues with the proposed funding the startup is requesting in order to move forward on its work.  Outlook grows opaque  The idea that permissioned blockchain startups are now up against substantial challenges can be seen in the shifting strategies at startups R3 and Digital Asset Holdings.  Greenspan noted that both are working less on distributed ledgers, and more on ""contract description languages"". The public language for Digital Asset’s new ""digital asset modeling language"" (DAML) backs up this assessment, with wording specifying that not all nodes on the network will process all updates to the ledger.  R3 is taking similar action with its latest distributed ledger, Corda. But R3’s positioning of its platform may be the most notable, given the manner with which R3 chief architect Richard Gendal Brown took in its official announcement.  Far from a victory lap, Brown’s statements can be read more aptly as an admission of how little ground has been made by big banks in applying blockchain to existing business problems. Brown went to great lengths in the post to laud bitcoin’s architecture in statements that color recent permissioned blockchain efforts as still striving to solve a ""business problem"" in the way that he argues the bitcoin blockchain already does.  In so many words, Brown positioned Corda on the basis that major financial institutions perhaps don’t need to use blockchains to exchange assets. Corda’s chief insight can be seen as the thesis that financial institutions today exchange contracts, and that a unique distributed ledger environment is needed to meet this need.  Overall, Brown’s words imply that he believes that blockchain innovations have yet to be fully applied to a traditional finance context, and that this challenge has yet to be overcome.  Bitcoin’s dark days brighten  On the opposite end of the spectrum, there seems to be the growing sentiment that bitcoin’s darkest and most contentious days may be behind it.  It’s no secret that the industry has taken its fair share of hits – major media mentions of bitcoin have declined amidst interest in permissioned blockchains and distributed ledger efforts at big banks. But, this time out of the spotlight may ultimately benefit bitcoin’s community.  With Segregated Witness, a plan to scale the bitcoin blockchain, moving forward and big bank blockchain projects hitting the aforementioned existential roadblocks, the path ahead for this community of innovators seems comparably brighter.  As shown by CoinDesk’s latest quarterly report, months of infighting among network developers seems to have done little to cause bitcoin’s price to decline or its rate of new wallet or ATM growth to decrease. Further, Bitcoin Core, its main development group, seems more coordinated than ever, even if they're operating more as the kind of unified entity they perhaps sought to avoid.  Granted, the bitcoin community still needs to determine the best path forward on how development is governed.  However, these issues appear more manageable in the face of issues at even established payments efforts like the W3C, where members are disillusioned by the outsized impact and influence of powerful stakeholders on the process of standardizing web payments.  In colloquial terms, the big bad wolves that have been howling outside of the house of bitcoin seem to be backing into the woods.  Rather than seen as a replacement for public blockchains, there’s a broader recognition that such technologies are best compared to “the Internet”, while permissioned efforts should be considered “Intranets”.  While not yet widely embraced – prominent startup execs like Chain CEO Adam Ludwin have fought against the idea that the Internet analogy is relevant – it’s inarguable that the public Internet was more impactful than any closed system.  The proliferation of this argument could go a long way toward increasing understanding of the value of systems such as bitcoin and Ethereum, and create more public awareness of the benefits of a permissionless innovation platform for the delivery of financial services outside traditional mediums.  The very long tail of change  What all this means for the path ahead is less clear.  But in pondering the question, I continue to go back to questioning the idea that technology is even capable of bringing about ""solutions"" to ""problems"". Based on the evidence, it would seem to be a somewhat misguided way to describe technology and what it achieves.  I recently purchased a run of mid-1990s Wired magazines, the headlines of which could be just as relevant today. Of note was one cover that heralded how the Internet could come to challenge cable television, published in 1998. Nearly 20 years later, this process is only just starting to occur.  Overall, the malaise on both sides of the industry can be seen as a symptom of the long tail of change the technology and underlying ideological movement are seeking.  If today really is 1993 in the lifespan of the second Internet, then banks might be best cast in the role of traditional media companies. In this light, it’s hard exactly to understand what major media companies could have gained from efforts to establish a consortium or even launching their own competitor to the Internet in a bid to deliver television.  Rather, as audiences migrated to a new platform, media companies simply adapted their services in a bid to extend their reach out of the idea that user preferences were simply changing with a new generation.  In turn, users of Internet platforms are simply leveraging this tech to obtain the same service at a lower cost, and with more convenient updates and delivery than entertainment outlets, which were central clearinghouses of such information, could ever have achieved.  What we gain from this variety is less clear.  One would be hard-pressed to call Netflix, for example, a solution to anything. While it may have replaced going to the video rental store, as those who have spent time aimlessly flipping its offerings will attest, it’s hardly a ""solution"" to quality viewing.  Rather, it simply altered the reality and the experience, providing some benefits along with some new hassles. It’s hard to imagine bitcoin and blockchain won’t deliver similar results.

42426880,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxOZh,1463577229,Former State Street Blockchain Lead Launches Post-Trade Startup,"State Street’s former blockchain lead for Europe and the Middle East has launched a new startup focused on using blockchain technology to “redesign” the securities services industry.  Called RISE Financial Technologies, the startup is seeking to provide distributed ledger technology that provides data integrity and immutability to financial trades in a way that is in harmony with existing bank processes. Advisors for the project include former Chairman of the European Banking Federation (EBF) Ruud Sleenhoff.  Led by CEO Thorsten Peisl, RISE is said to be actively testing its solutions with financial institutions including banks, custodians and central securities depositories (CSDs). Peisl's departure from his previous company was made public in January.  Given the recent concerns about confidentiality within distributed ledger environments, RISE said it has built its technology so that different parties have different levels of access to information stored with its ledger tech.  The company said:  ""Issuers have a view but no control into final beneficiaries; financial institutions (ledger operators/validators) have access to client information; and regulators have a complete view of the information in their jurisdiction in real-time but no direct control over the assets.""  In statements, Peisl said that he foresees distributed ledgers changing the way post-trade processes work, but that in order to do so, the technology needs to be custom built for the industry’s use.
