By contrast, investors have dialed back their growth outlook for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Since the start of 2023, following the crypto rout in the previous year, both ether ( ETH-USD ) and bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) have seen immense buying pressure, climbing 31% and 39% , respectively, as of Friday afternoon. Also, the tokens recently erased their losses since the November 2022 implosion of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ), an abrupt event that roiled the market and tarnished the industry’s reputation. Despite bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) YTD outperformance versus ether ( ETH-USD ), a record 60% of investors believed ETH has the most compelling growth outlook, according to a CoinShares survey conducted between Dec. 29, 2022 and Jan. 23, 2023, up from 40% in the October 2022 survey. On the other hand, some 30% of respondents viewed bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as the most attractive going forward, down from nearly 40% previously. Last week, CoinShares noted weekly inflows for investment products that allow investors to bet on lower bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices hit the highest mark since July 2022, while products that wager on higher ether ( ETH-USD ) prices saw solid inflows. That dynamic underscores the bearishness in bitcoin relative to ether. Overall, the survey, which consisted of 43 responses from investors who cover $390B of assets under management, indicated that digital assets weighting in investment portfolios represented 1.1% of portfolios, having risen from the previous 0.7% reading. Investors cited both speculation and exposure to distributed ledger technology as the key reasons behind taking stake in digital assets. Like all asset classes, digital assets carry certain risks, with the two biggest ones being increased regulation and a government ban, “although far few expect political blockers and a government ban,” CoinShares said. “This suggests investors see regulation being the solution rather than an outright ban.” The survey also found a big rise in concerns over the custody of digital assets, which makes sense given FTX’s ( FTT-USD ) collapse (and its contagion effects) was said to have triggered the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to intensify its scrutiny of registered investment advisors who directly or indirectly have custody of client crypto assets. Vincent Gusdorf, senior vice president, head of DeFi and Digital Assets Analytics at Moody’s Investors Service, expects bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ) to dominate the crypto landscape in 2023 “as investors seek more established assets,” he said in a recent report. “Tighter financial conditions and the possibility of new frauds will hinder the recovery of crypto asset markets. However, innovation and the introduction of regulatory frameworks in several territories will provide a better operating environment.” Seeking Alpha contributor The Digital Trend took note of bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) recent rally and market participants’ calls for a bottom, but remains skeptical.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3929120-ethereum-to-shine-the-most-among-cryptos-including-bitcoin-survey-shows?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8466668.jpeg

Following the market crash in late 2022, FTM began the new year trading as low as $0.2007, representing a 94.19% decline from its all-time high value of $3.46. However, with the entire crypto market attempting to pull off a recovery, FTM has been one particular token with lots of investor attention, as its price has surged by over 136% since the start of 2023. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Observes Highest Rise In Burn Rate – Is This Normal? Fantom Records 39% Profit In Seven Days According to data from CoinMarketCap, Fantom (FTM) gained by 38.77% in the last seven days alone, outperforming major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), and Bitcoin (BTC) itself. While FTM has been on an upward trend since the first week of the year, its price rally in the last week can be attributed to Fantom’s recent integration with the Axelar Network. On Jan. 24, the Fantom Foundation announced a partnership with Axelar, which will introduce interchain communication to the Fantom Network. As of the time of writing, FTM is trading at $0.4724, having gone up by 1.98% in the last 24 hours. Based on more data from CoinMarketCap, the daily trading volume of FTM is currently $240.7 million, while its total market cap is $1.312 billion.

What Does Axelar’s Integration Mean For Fantom Users? According to a blog post by Fantom, “Axelar network is a blockchain that connects blockchains, enabling universal Web 3 interoperability.” Basically, Axelar functions as a medium for communication and transfer of value between several blockchains. Following the integration with the Axelar network, Fantom automatically becomes part of an ecosystem that consists of over 30 different blockchains capable of seamlessly interacting with one another. Using the General Message Passing (GMP) protocol, developers on the Fantom network will be able to easily access smart-contact codes on any chain connected to Axelar. The GMP protocol will also allow dApps and users to send and receive data and function calls across the multiple chains in Axelar’s ecosystem. Another benefit of Axelar’s integration with Fantom is the introduction of one-click cross-chain swaps on the platform’s biggest decentralized exchange, SpookySwap. Using Squid, an Axelar-based protocol that reroutes liquidity between chains, SpookySwap users will seamlessly swap native tokens of different chains in one click. In every transaction, the Axelar network will process the cross-chain gas conversions from the source-chain token to the destination-chain token, ensuring that users need not own crypto wallets on multiple chains or hold native tokens of other chains for gas fees, That said, other chains on the Axelar Network aside from Fantom include Arbitrum, Moonbeam, Polygon, Osmosis, etc. Featured Image: Zipmex, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,FTM,BLOCKCHAIN | FTM | ICO | TRADING | AXL,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/altcoin/fantom-gains-39-in-7-days/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The current number of Shiba Inu burn trackers is quite surprising. However, data shows it is due to the degenerative performance of the SHIB burning machine. On-chain data shows that the SHIB burn rate observed a massive 1682.07% increase over the past 24 hours. That is the highest percentage rise in the burn rate on the SHIB network in the past few months. Related Reading: US Federal Regulators Warn About Crypto Activities Why Is SHIB Burn Rate Increasing? In detail, the number of burnt tokens on the Shiba Inu network did not exceed 1 million SHIB on January 26. Yesterday’s amount was one of the lowest numbers of assets developers has burned on the network. So, the seeming spike in burn rate could be due to a default in the SHIB burning machine yesterday. According to analysts, this percentage spike wasn’t triggered by increased network activity. Also, it didn’t represent a large number of actually burnt tokens. Token burns help to reduce the number of coins in circulation. It helps increase an asset’s scarcity and possibly boost the token’s price when increased supply pushes it down. For instance, on January 17, the SHIB token burn surged by 613% within 24 hours, and the coin broke the bearish traders’ expectations, rising above 20% on the day. However, a surge in price did not accompany the recent rise in the token burn rate. Also, some SHIB whale activities indicate that top investors have lost faith in the meme coin as many whales keep moving chunks of Shiba Inu positions on exchanges. 🚨 🚨 3,312,307,240,798 #SHIB (38,257,148 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/0mdLkwpPQQ — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 26, 2023 This could mean that short-term traders don’t believe the asset couldn’t rise above the resistance level, helping them earn profit. New SHIB Whales Emerge – What’s Next? While some whales sell off their tokens, a new address is buying the dip, accumulating large amounts of SHIB tokens, and maybe awaiting the next bull market. Data shows that a new crypto wallet became a Shiba Inu whale address on Thursday, January 26, 2022. Related Reading: Crypto-Friendly Bank Silvergate Suspends Dividend Payouts The new wallet became a whale address after receiving 3.3 billion SHIB worth about $38.9 million. Etherscan revealed that the sending address moved funds from different wallets before transferring the tokens to the receiver, now the newest SHIB whale. This move further confirms our suspicion that smaller investors are giving up their positions. According to the blockchain whale tracker, Whale Alert, the wallet also received 1 billion PAW tokens a few minutes after sweeping the SHIB token. With the current balance, the new whale is now the world’s 30th-largest SHIB holder. This recent accumulation came after the world’s 26th-largest SHIB holder swept 150 billion tokens into its wallet. The token sweep occurred through four transaction clusters within three hours on January 23. So while short-term investors might be selling their positions due to falling SHIB prices, some could be accumulating in anticipation of future gains from the upcoming Shibarium launch.

According to reports, AAVE has passed a governance proposal that would eradicate all bad debt it accumulated when Avraham Eisenberg, orchestrator of the Mango Markets exploit, targeted the platform’s Ethereum V2 liquidity pool back in November 2022. However, the governance token of the platform, AAVE, has not responded either positively or negatively. According to data from CoinGecko, the token registered losses in the daily and weekly time frames. But these losses are too miniscule to revert the token’s gains from the start of the year. With the launch of AAVE’s V3 on its mainnet, the crypto might be in a position to tally new highs if the situation permits it. Image: Coinpedia The Gist Of The Proposal & On-Chain Developments Based on the proposal, the token has over 2,677,749 units of CRV in debt on its Ethereum V2 CRV reserve. This is worth, at the date of the proposal, over $2.5 million. The proposal would use V2’s stablecoin reserve to buy the necessary number of units of CRV to pay the debt. This obviously was accepted by the community positively, being implemented immediately by January 25th. This would reverse the damage of the exploit attempt, proving the liquidity of the protocol. The deployment of AAVE’s V3 on Ethereum was also implemented. According to DefiLlama, the crypto is in the top 4 among all platforms. AAVE V3, the Ethereum pool deployment, has over $526.52 million total value locked. Image: DefiLlama At $86.02, What’s In Store For AAVE? The token is currently consolidating around the $85.8 support range. This could be a sign that the token still has room to regain lost ground from 2022’s bear market. However, this can only be achieved if the token closes with a green candle to continue AAVE’s rally when the year started. Investors and traders should target the token’s current resistance at $90.15. If the bulls can consolidate at the token’s present support, we can see an upward push towards $94.70.

Investors should also monitor the token’s correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum as these would have a big influence on its price movement in the short to medium term. As these major cryptocurrencies retest their crucial resistances, a breakthrough by either one or both of these coins would boost AAVE’s momentum to regain lost ground. With this in mind, investors and traders should exercise caution in the short to medium term as the token can still be clawed by the bears to revert back to $78.65.

8425408,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517903,1674968267,Litecoin (LTC) Displays Consolidation – Can We Expect A Reversal Soon?,"The Litecoin price has shown considerable recovery ever since it reached its bottom in December 2022. LTC secured almost 50% appreciation in January this year. Currently, however, the altcoin has witnessed a price pullback and is consolidating on its daily chart. Over the last 24 hours, the Litecoin price moved down by 0.3%, which signified a range-bound movement. The altcoin also lost close to 3% of its market value. The technical outlook of Litecoin pointed towards bullish momentum as demand for the altcoin remained high on the daily chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach Highest Value Since FTX Crash, Bullish? Accumulation also reflected the same. Price noted a decline as LTC receded from the overbought zone. Buyers still have the upper hand on the chart. A continued fall in accumulation will cause bears to secure Litecoin’s price action. That momentum would continue for the upcoming week, causing LTC to fall below its nearest support level. At the time of writing, LTC was trading 78% below its all-time high set in 2021. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LTC was trading at $88.11 at the time of writing. The coin has pierced through several resistance lines over the past several weeks but has failed to hold on to the momentum. LTC met with two rigid resistance levels before it started to move south again. The two important resistance lines for the coin stood at $90 and $92. Immediate resistance stood at $90. If demand for the altcoin remains steady, then LTC might attempt to breach the $90 price mark. On the flipside, the nearest support line for the Litecoin price stood at $86, and a continued price correction will force LTC to fall below the $86 price mark and settle at $82. The amount of LTC traded in the last session was red, indicating a fall in buyers. Technical Analysis The altcoin has been hovering in the overbought region for several weeks now, and at the moment there is a slight fall in demand for Litecoin. The Relative Strength Index stood a little below the 60-mark after it noted a recent downtick indicating that demand was shrinking. A reading close to the 60-mark, however, signifies that buyers outnumbered sellers. In accordance with that, LTC price shot past the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line as buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. The coin was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) and 200-SMA (green) lines, indicating increased bullishness. Concerning the fall in buying pressure, the LTC chart displayed a sell signal on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which depicts market momentum, underwent a bearish crossover and formed red signal bars tied to sell signals. Related Reading: What Is Threshold (T) And Why Is This Lesser-Known Coin Swelling By 146%? This could also imply that the price will fall in the coming trading sessions. The Parabolic SAR, the indicator that reads the trend and change in price momentum, was still positive. The dotted lines were below the candlesticks, suggesting that the LTC price was still positive.

8496146,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517914,1674965863,Digital assets got government support in 2022,"2022 was a disruptive year for crypto, but despite the market and industry turmoil surrounding cryptocurrencies, several forward-thinking countries took steps to embrace digital assets. Whether it is through legal recognition, clearer regulation or the debut of CBDCs, crypto is gradually becoming established as a legitimate financial phenomenon throughout the world. Crypto exchange StormGain explains the cases of five countries that are entering 2023 after making significant progress in the crypto sector: The United Kingdom Britain can hardly be said to have had an easy 2022, losing its long-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, and cycling through two prime ministers during the aftershocks of Brexit. Throughout this turmoil, the government doggedly took steps to modernise its economy and establish clearer crypto regulations. The UK introduced the Financial Services and Markets Bill in July 2022. The legislation clarified regulations around stablecoins and introduced the concept of Digital Settlement Assets (DSA). The bill enables the UK Treasury to regulate DSAs for a variety of financial activities, including payments, settlements, etc. Britain also took steps to make crypto safer for users in the country with the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill, introduced in May, which grants authorities extra powers to seize illegally acquired crypto assets. It also loosened data collection requirements on crypto transfers between unhosted wallets. The UK’s High Court of Justice also established a major legal precedent in the case of non-fungible tokens, ruling that NFTs represent “private property”. Finally, at the end of the year, Britain also made “designated crypto assets” not subject to UK tax for investments conducted by an investment manager in the country. The Central African Republic The Central African Republic (CAR) made history in May 2022 when it became the first African nation to legalise cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Lawmakers unanimously approved the new cryptocurrency bill that supported crypto payments in all kinds of businesses and set a framework for paying tax in cryptocurrency. Two months later, the CAR launched Sango Coin, its official CBDC. Over $1.5 million worth of Sango Coin has been sold, and the country has floated plans for allowing global investors to buy citizenship using the CBDC. The United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates has been steadily making progress in building a crypto environment that is attractive to foreign investors. In March 2022, Dubai deployed a new regulatory framework around crypto that proposed clear international standards for governing the digital asset industry. A new body, called the Dubai Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), was established to enforce regulations in the Emirate’s special development and free zones (except the Dubai International Financial Centre). These positive actions were followed by the Dubai Metaverse Strategy in July 2022, which lays the groundwork for turning the Emirate into a Web3 economic powerhouse. The strategy details research and development (R&D) partnerships, venture capital incentives to entice global projects, and support for a metaverse education programme targeting users, creators and developers alike. Other emirates in the UAE have not been slouches either when it comes to crypto. In October 2022, the Emirate of Sharjah opened Sharjahverse, a virtual replica of the emirate’s 1,000-square-mile territory that aims to drive the metaverse tourism industry. Abu Dhabi drafted recommendations for NFT trading that define NFTs as intellectual property and legalise NFT marketplaces under various trading organisations. El Salvador El Salvador has been a crypto champion since 2021, with president Nayib Bukele’s government continuing to push its vision of ‘Bitcoin bonds’ in the intervening years, although hitting several delays along the way. Most recently, economy minister Maria Luisa Hayem Brevé introduced a bill detailing plans to raise $1 billion to fund the construction of a ‘Bitcoin city’, although without a concrete follow-up to date. El Salvador’s crypto-friendliness appears to have done wonders for its tourism industry. According to the country’s tourism minister, the sector jumped by more than 30% since advertising its support of Bitcoin (BTC) in 2021. Crypto is a legal tender in El Salvador, and 20% of businesses in the Latin American nation now accept Bitcoin as payment. El Salvador has also hosted multiple crypto conferences and invited central bank representatives from around the world to discuss the application and development of digital assets. Brazil Cryptocurrency has been growing in popularity in the Latin American nation of Brazil, which legalised the use of crypto payments for licensed financial service providers in 2022. This regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies was one of the last acts of former president Jair Bolsonaro, and a timely one at that. A record number of Brazilian companies were recorded as holding one or more cryptocurrencies in 2022, according to the nation’s tax authorities. The Brazilian Stock Exchange also lists several financial instruments connected to cryptocurrencies.
