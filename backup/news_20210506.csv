Some regard the Bitcoin-based “Colored Coins” as the first NFT.  The other two works in the Sotheby’s auction are a rare CryptoPunk from 2017 and Anna Ridler’s “The Shell Record” from 2021.  Bidding will begin at $100 and a portion of the funds raised from the sale will go to the Sevens Foundation, a non-profit supporting digital artists.

The New York-based institutional bitcoin powerhouse is named as “bitcoin custodian” in a Thursday filing update with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

No bitcoin ETF has been approved by the SEC.

Bitcoin has less than 10% of gold’s market capitalization but could continue to differentiate itself from the yellow metal and grow its piece of the total market-cap pie.    Ether (ETH) trading around $3,483 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.28% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $3,397-$3,607 (CoinDesk 20)  Ethereum Classic (ETC) trading around $148 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 50% over the previous 24 hours.  Eos (EOS) trading around $12.29 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 48% over the previous 24 hours.  Cardano (ADA) trading around $1.59 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 9% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $56,161 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 1.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $56,586-$58,266 (CoinDesk 20)    Big-time gainers Thursday included tokens associated with blockchain projects that aim to replicate some of the key attributes of Ethereum, mainly programmability.      In the past month, ethereum classic (ETC) has gained over 1,250%, while cardano (ADA) has jumped 238% and eos (EOS) is up 42%, according to Kraken spot data provided by charting software TradingView.      The gains come as the giant Dutch bank ING used a recent report to throw some support behind the notion of programmable money used for decentralized finance, or DeFi.      “The recent bull run of ETH has shed some light on competing projects to the Ethereum value proposition, which can be bundled into a category that we can call a ‘sector,” said Elie Le Rest, partner at trading firm ExoAlpha. “The crypto market tends to work on comparable principles, meaning that if a coin of a ‘sector’ has been doing great, such as ETH in the ‘layer 1 sector,’ then other coins of this same sector may follow a similar trend.”      Layer 1 refers to blockchains that can serve as the foundation for various programming languages to create applications, known as smart contracts, that perform financial functions. Ethereum is a layer 1 smart-contract blockchain; ETC, ADA, and EOS are similar.      A Wall Street Journal article published Thursday highlights that retail investors are searching for value coins. Ethereum classic may no longer fit that bill, currently priced around $130, according to CoinDesk 20 data, but cardano priced at around $1.63 and eos at a little over $12 certainly do.      “Interest has flowed out of bitcoin and into [altcoins] for the time being. People are looking further out the risk spectrum for returns,” noted Ciaran Neilan, an executive at crypto market maker GSR.      Bitcoin’s dominance, its share of the greater cryptocurrency market cap, is one sign of a loss of interest for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency. As of press time, BTC dominance, according to chart provider TradingView, was at around 45%, a low not seen since July 2018.      During the last bull market, at the start of 2018, bitcoin’s dominance dumped to an all-time low of 35% as investors redeployed their bitcoin gains into alternative cryptocurrencies.      Early this year, bitcoin dominance went as high as 72%. GSR’s Neilan said that dominance percentage will likely return. “It will end how it usually does,"" Neilan said. ""BTC consolidates, then takes back the headlines.”    Institutional interest, price of ether higher than ever    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, hit a fresh high Thursday of $3,607 at around 17:30 UTC (12:30 p.m. ET), according to CoinDesk 20 data. The price has settled on some heavy selling, but still gained 0.28%.      The European Investment Bank (EIB) issuance of a $121 million bond on Ethereum as another sign of institutional support for the ether ecosystem.      “I think ether has benefited from the recent Berlin upgrade,"" Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner at investment firm Tellurian Capital. ""For once we have a new all-time high and lots of DeFi activity without a simultaneous explosion of gas [transaction] fees.” The EIB bond issuance could be another sign of institutional support for the ether ecosystem, he said.      In the ether derivatives market, ETH futures are now at $10 billion – an all-time high. More sophisticated investors are entering the market and requiring more complex instruments. In the past month, open interest in ether futures has climbed by 47% across major venues.      “I think we're just getting started,” Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer for investment firm Ether Capital, told CoinDesk. “The addressable market for ETH is almost infinitely larger than bitcoin.”      Read More: Ether Traders Load Up on $8K Call Options in Bet Price Will Double by July    Bitcoin-gold correlation dumping    The price of bitcoin was down Thursday, going as low as $56,586 around 08:15 UTC (3:15 a.m. ET).      The trading range was even tighter than the day before. Thursday’s $56,586-$58,266 spot price variance was narrower than Wednesday’s $53,633-$57,356 range. BTC is below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.      “We're seeing BTC almost completely flat while ETH has pumped,” noted Andrew Tu, an executive at quant trading firm Efficient Frontier.      “I don't think this is the last we've heard from bitcoin, perhaps just a breather on its march to gold's market cap,” Coolican said. Bitcoin’s current market capitalization is over $1 trillion, according to CoinGecko, versus gold's more than $11 trillion.      The correlation between the two assets, according to data aggregator Coin Metrics, is near zero, which means their prices are no longer moving in sync as they were for most of last year. In October, the metric passed 0.6. A 1 would signify perfect synchronicity.      Mostafa Al-Mashita, vice president for trading at quant firm Efficient Frontier, says he's ready for the return of BTC action.      “Another leg up for bitcoin is not expected anymore, which is why it'll likely happen,” Al-Mashita told CoinDesk.

42386679,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUWLT,1620327393,Consensus 2021: Rebuilding the Internet With Blockchain Broadcasting,"The names we have for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are entirely inappropriate. They describe ways to store data, which does not capture its function as a new way to transmit it. What makes blockchain so transformative is its data transmission protocol. It distributes data in a manner of “broadcasting,” as opposed to linear transmissions the vast majority of IT processes use.      At this time, cryptocurrencies happen to be the simplest and by far the most common use case for blockchain tech, but I have my eyes set on a future where blockchain innovates the internet as we know it.    Yifan He is founder and CEO of Red Date Tech, the architect firm behind China's Blockchain Service Network (BSN). He will be speaking at CoinDesk's virtual event Consensus 2021, May 24-27.    In the early days of the internet, transferring data between individual computers was a manual process, often involving tapes, floppy disks or CDs. The basic premise was to transfer data within seconds, and linking all computers, everywhere, is what makes the “World Wide Web.”      We’ve all seen the changes this data transmission technology has brought to the world, but when the internet was first invented over half a century ago, information systems were in their early stages and business transactions relatively simple.    Read more: Inside China’s Effort to Create a Blockchain It Can Control    With today’s internet, if a business scenario involves multiple IT systems, data is transmitted between them one by one. The more systems there are, the more convoluted this linear process becomes; an early participant won’t know what happens with later participants and there are time lags between each party in receipt of the data. There is no easy way to counteract the possibility some or all of the data has been manipulated along the way.    We can rebuild the internet to become more secure, more efficient and more privacy oriented.    When you consider all of the privacy and security issues the internet has now in its current form, it can be seen as a legacy system in need of an upgrade. The basis of blockchain enables different computers to communicate seamlessly with multiple counterparts, and any data changes can be synced to all IT systems in real time. It really does not matter if you save the data into a block, ledger or even a traditional database.      There is no doubt in my mind that using blockchain tech for its broadcasting data transmission capability is the key to evolving the internet. Why, for instance, when we send an email, does it need to pass through and be stored in third-party servers on its way to the intended recipient? Why, when we visit a website, can’t we choose how personal data is shared with the host?      To help you understand the power of data broadcasting, here is an example: self-driving cars. In a linear transmission process, a self-driving car could only rely on each neighboring vehicle to share its current and intended movement data, which is a slow and inefficient process. Should the request for this information of each vehicle be exchanged and reacted upon via broadcasting data transmission, instantaneous synchronicity between all vehicles within a certain radius improves everyone’s experience.    Read more: Meet Red Date, the Little-Known Tech Firm Behind China’s Big Blockchain Vision    With blockchain technology’s ability to transmit data through broadcasting, we can rebuild the internet to become more secure, more efficient and more privacy oriented, and we can evolve other IT processes to innovate 21st-century living. This is the motivation behind and vision we hold for BSN.      We simply are not in the business of working with speculative cryptocurrencies. Red Date will continue to invest in the research and development of blockchain’s underlying technology and the global infrastructure based upon it. While the possibilities for using blockchain tech are wide-ranging, not nearly enough industry professionals are leveraging the research and development needed for it to begin solving real-world problems. The sooner this changes, the sooner we all benefit.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Yifan He,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/06/consensus-2021-rebuilding-the-internet-with-blockchain-broadcasting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/237200c4217a73c598335284d8ff8cbc36257005-2400x1602.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386671,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUWHh,1620327251,Over 20 Organizations Form Alliance to Focus on Data Privacy and Monetization,"Over 20 businesses worldwide have created the Data Privacy Protocol Alliance (DPPA). DPPA said Wednesday it intends to build a decentralized blockchain-based data system it hopes will compete against data monopolies such as Google or Facebook by allowing users to take control of their own data.      Specifically, the Data Privacy Protocol Alliance will develop a set of guidelines and specifications for a version of CasperLabs’ layer one blockchain “optimized for data sharing, data storage, data ownership and data monetization,” according to the announcement.      The Casper Network is a proof-of-stake network where businesses can build private or permissioned applications. The network also claims to offer upgradeable smart contracts, predictable gas fees and the ability to support scale.      Speaking at the founding members meeting on May 4, Ivan Lazano, head of product at DPPA founding member BIGtoken, presented an initial proposal. He said any system should include being able to support tools like a data wallet that gives users control over their data and who monetizes it, It should also include non-commercial data storing and sharing capabilities. He also said any data privacy system should also let commercial users onboard, verify and handle large data sets, among other areas.    Read more: Permission.io Has Quietly Raised $50M to Make Advertising Personal and Data Private    “Together, we’re creating an ecosystem with the technology and scale to compete with the centralized data monopolies,” said Lou Kerner, CEO of BIGtoken, in a statement. “The DPPA will enable true data ownership and provide consumers the tools and transparency to individually choose how their data is shared and monetized.”      In practice, the DPPA will look to become a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that will govern the protocol to optimize data sharing, data storing, data ownership and data monetization.    The data privacy appeal    The promise of data protections and privacy has long been a driving force in the appeal of decentralized systems. The removal of a centralized body that hoards user data – and could use or even abuse it – changes the dynamics for consumers. The companies focusing on these sorts of projects also tend to see increased interest from funders.      For example, Permission.io, one of the founding members of the DPPA, offers a platform that incentivizes users to grant advertisers and other merchant participants access to their time and data in a peer-to-peer way. The company has raised over $50 million. Similarly, the programmable privacy startup Aleo recently raised $28 million.      With privacy becoming increasingly important, the DPPA represents another stab at figuring out ways to address the issue at scale.    Read more: As Pandemic Decimates Startups, Privacy Industry Holds Strong    According to a recent survey from opt-in data marketplace BIGtoken, 78% of the 35,000 consumers queried said that they’re somewhat concerned or extremely concerned about their data privacy.      Founding members of the DPPA are located in the U.S., Singapore, the U.K. and Israel. The organization includes data aggregators, privacy advocates, brands, agencies and advertising platforms.      “In a world with all-time high unemployment rates, where people are struggling to meet their basic needs, personal data monetization can allow individuals to earn enough money to at least feed themselves and their families, securing their basic human rights. This is where data ownership is truly revolutionary,” said Brittany Kaiser, co-founder of the Own Your Data Foundation, another founding organization of the DPPA, in a statement.

42386665,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUW7d,1620324509,India's Central-Bank Owned Retail Payments Platform Refuses to Ban Crypto Transactions,"The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a central bank-owned retail payments system, has deferred the issue of whether to allow customers to make and receive payments from cryptocurrency trading to commercial banks, according to the Economic Times.      Some bankers apparently had asked the agency to block crypto transactions on its network, the paper reported. Instead, the agency told banks they should consult their legal and compliance departments on whether they should block transactions on their own systems.      “The banks had approached NPCI for restricting direct UPI transactions,” the Economic Times wrote, citing an industry official. “However, the committee has put the onus on banks.”      The development represents the latest chapter in the ongoing saga of whether the Indian government might crack down on cryptocurrencies, even as trading volumes in digital assets have exploded over the past 12 months.      In March 2020, the Supreme Court of India set aside the Reserve Bank of India's banking ban on cryptocurrency trading. Since early this year, the Indian government has been mulling a ban on private cryptocurrencies.      NPCI's decision to put the onus on the banks comes at a time when few lenders are blocking cryptocurrency deals.      Per the ET report, some banks have blacklisted merchants buying or selling cryptocurrencies, though few are restricting customers from funding crypto trading accounts via net banking and united payments (UPI) interface.      ""Customers of banks which have disabled crypto cannot anyway use facilities like UPI, net banking or cards,"" the industry official told ET. ""However, trades continue to happen as many banks are still allowing.""      Some experts say the government would be better off legitimizing bitcoin by regulating it like corporate stock.      ""Just like you cannot ban porn, you cannot ban cryptocurrency,"" Ratan Sharda, author, editor, and TV panelist, said last year.      IndiaTech.org, an industry association representing India's consumer internet startups and investors, published a white paper on Wednesday, asking the government to recognize cryptocurrencies as digital assets and not currencies.      Also read: Indian Crypto Firms Suggest Policy Ideas to Government Ahead of Possible Ban      ""If NPCI had taken a central decision to disable united payments interface and RuPay cards for investing in cryptos, it would have applied to all banks uniformly and left investors with fewer payment options,"" an industry official told ET.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/06/indias-central-bank-owned-retail-payments-platform-refuses-to-ban-crypto-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd27429d75ee2817b68073aec956ce8720804db7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In his first public hearing since becoming the head of the federal securities regulator, Gensler said the SEC’s authority is restricted to securities and products or asset managers that might invest in cryptocurrencies. But he suggested Congress could take a role in bringing greater regulatory clarity, particularly around exchanges.      “Right now these exchanges do not have a regulatory framework at the SEC or at our sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,” he said. “Right now there’s not a market regulator around these crypto exchanges and thus there’s really no protection around fraud or manipulation.”      Gensler did not specify what regulations around crypto exchanges could look like.      His comments, which came in response to a question about digital assets from Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), also touched on a proposed rulemaking for custody, which the SEC chair said he hopes will move forward.      McHenry, who sponsored a bill addressing how the SEC and CFTC might divvy up oversight of crypto, asked how Gensler could improve regulatory clarity around digital assets.    GameStop    Thursday’s hearing was the third held by the House Financial Services Committee that looked at the regulatory response to the GameStop stock price jump earlier this year.      Gensler did not address crypto in his pre-written opening remarks, instead focusing on aspects of the GameStop pump and other recent market events, such as the collapse of Archegos Capital.      The new SEC chair did speak generally about technology and social media’s role in the public stock market.      “Technology can bring greater access to our capital markets,” Gensler said in his opening remarks.      He mentioned the role of online communities like Reddit in boosting stock prices, but said he was not interested in curtailing free speech – rather, Gensler said he is interested in seeing whether malicious actors took advantage of these communities to manipulate markets.

The bank said it will provide the infrastructure for the CBDCs but before issuance it needs to conduct a comprehensive study of the benefits and risks associated with a digital currency and the method used to issue and distribute it.  The next step will be to conduct research around CBDCs with participants from the financial markets.  Many other central banks around the world are already carrying out similar experiments.  In April, Norges Bank announced it is moving ahead and will start testing technical solutions for a CBDC over the next two years.  The Bank of Japan announced plans to begin phase one of experimenting with a CBDC by conducting experiments on the basic functions such as issuance, distribution, and redemption.  In the meantime, China, which is further ahead in the CBDC race than other major powers, has been testing platforms on which the digital yuan can be freely traded with other fiat currencies.

42386670,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUWDv,1620318805,Dogecoin: From Shiba Inu to Scapegoat,"Grave pronouncements are circulating amid the recent surge in interest in dogecoin. As the meme-currency rallies, hitting a recent high above 70 cents, some people see the retail-led, celebrity-endorsed in-joke as a potential harbinger for greater government involvement in crypto as a whole. The joke has gotten serious.      Dogecoin is the best-performing digital asset over the past year. Worth less than 1 cent at the start of 2020, dogecoin has become one of the most valuable crypto networks. It has a market cap of $77 billion, making it worth more than Lloyds Banking Group, as Galaxy Digital noted in a recent Dogecoin report. If U.S. investors put all three of their pandemic relief stimulus checks in DOGE, as they came in, they’d be sitting pretty on nearly half a million dollars.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    “I don't think people realize yet how badly this Dogecoin thing is going to end. Going to be a disaster of epic proportions and a lot of people that don't know any better are going to get hurt,” Jeff Vandroux, accountant developer of the KeyKeeper Bitcoin IRA, said on Twitter. “It's also going to offer up on a silver platter an excuse for more [government] monitoring.”    Read more: Will Elon Musk’s ‘SNL’ Appearance Send Dogecoin to the Moon? Curb Your Enthusiasm    There are technical concerns worth taking seriously about dogecoin. Although fairly distributed with about 2,000 active nodes, less than a quarter are fully synced (or broadcasting the most up-to-date history of the blockchain). Some active nodes are missing more than half the blockchain’s transaction history.      Further, it can be incredibly hard to spin up a DOGE node. Galaxy, a well-capitalized digital merchant bank that is planning a U.S. listing, had trouble running Dogecoin core. The network’s one minute block times mean most nodes experience latency, Galaxy found. This makes the network less secure and harder to transact on.      That said, the most apocalyptic fears are overblown. Although vulnerable to 51% attacks, the Dogecoin network is relatively secure. A fork-of-a-fork-of-a-fork-of-Litecoin, Dogecoin is also merge-mined with its forbear, meaning it shares network security with Charlie Lee’s brainchild. And while there hasn’t been active Dogecoin development since 2017, its lead maintainer, Ross Nicoll, is committed to keeping the “currency operational.”      But dogecoin is more of a social phenomenon than a technical one. Launched as a parody of bitcoin and a multitude of copycats, DOGE is paraded as being the “people’s crypto.” That’s what Mark Cuban says as he enables the masses to buy overpriced Mavs merch with DOGE.      In this sense, dogecoin has very real associations with the day-traders’ populist revolt of GameStop. Bloq Chairman Matthew Roszak said yesterday on CoinDesk TV that dogecoin is “a primitive” for what could happen when a band of “like-minded” people realize their collective power.      GameStop made some sundry folk very rich, tanked a hedge fund and enriched several of its Wall Street peers. It also led to congressional hearings on obscure financial mechanisms like “payment for order flow” and t+2 settlement. Changes to both are likely, for better or worse.      Vandroux, the CPA, isn’t alone in thinking what’s happening with dogecoin could end badly. Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal thinks widespread losses could increase the heat on the entire cryptocurrency industry. Others have raised similar concerns.      It’s not out of the question that greater market surveillance or “consumer protections” may result from this irrational exuberance.    Read more: The Node: Dogecoin Is a Joke, Get Over It    Despite its technical weaknesses, popular brokerages Robinhood and WeBull are letting people day-trade the coin, while crypto natives like Gemini recently listed it, saying it’s “no joke.” Should they be howled out of town for making money on trading fees? Should they be held responsible for coming government interference? Who is going to take dogecoin out back to make like Old Yeller for the sake of the industry?      Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Wall Street Journal recently: “I frankly don't think we have the framework in the United States” to deal with a host of money laundering, terrorist financing and consumer risk protection that crypto raises. Surveillance is coming one way or another. Man, it's already here.      Is DOGE being made into a scapegoat?

42386676,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUWKD,1620315702,Minting Your Meme NFT Won't Burn the Planet,"Crypto makes people mad; it always has. They're mad they didn’t get it, in 2010, or 2014, or 2019; they’re mad because fortunes are being made, seemingly effortlessly, from what appears to them to be nonsense; they’re mad because they failed to see one of the biggest innovations in computer history coming.      Charlie Munger very nearly burst into tears on Saturday at even the thought of Bitcoin’s success. And no wonder; it’s not a market Berkshire Hathaway can corner. Everyone’s yelling about crypto on Twitter, and indignation is fun, whether you have the faintest idea what you’re talking about or not.    Maria Bustillos is a founding editor of The Brick House Cooperative and was founder editor of Popula.    People are particularly mad about non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a mysterious crypto thing that is manifestly not art, and yet millions are somehow changing hands, for things that aren’t even things, that you can’t even own! Plus NFTs burn a ton of carbon, and as everyone knows, that’s bad.      Except they really don’t. As ever, emotionally driven prejudices make people eager to believe the most ridiculous lies, about NFTs and about blockchain more generally.      The most immediate misconception about NFTs is the idea that crypto energy use is tied directly to transaction volume, so that the carbon footprint will rise and rise, the more transactions there are. That is completely false. It’s the competition between miners, not transaction volume, that determines energy costs in a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain. One block mined in a PoW system might represent tens of thousands of individual transactions, or very few, or none at all, at the same energy cost.      In other words, an ETH or BTC transaction is not remotely analogous to a VISA swipe.      Whether you choose to list your commemorative ""Downfall"" meme on Foundation or not, proof-of-work crypto miners will continue to buy the same amount of hardware and use the same amount of electricity on mining crypto rewards.    Read more: How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT    We’ll leave aside for now that proof-of-work as it was originally designed is on its way out, that innovations like sidechains will continue to improve Bitcoin’s carbon footprint, that insanely more efficient proof-of-stake blockchains are online as we speak and that the Ethereum merge to proof-of-stake is months, not years, away.      The carbon footprint of crypto, a very small part of which is represented by NFTs, has to be assessed within the larger context of global emissions. Video games in the U.S. alone, according to a pre-pandemic 2019 study at UC Berkeley, had a carbon footprint of 24 megatons – substantially more than the global estimates for Ethereum, which fall somewhere between 16 and 20 megatons. Even the most wildly inflated, indefensible estimates of crypto’s global carbon footprint (about 127 megatons) are dwarfed by sector after sector of the global economy.      In this image, crypto mining would represent a space about a quarter the size of “rice cultivation.” SUVs alone produce in excess of 700 megatons of C02 annually. Air travel: 915 megatons. As Michel Rauchs of the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance recently pointed out at CNBC, bitcoin mining uses too much electricity, for sure, but also “the amount of energy wasted on idle home devices like phone chargers and microwaves in the U.S. could power the bitcoin network for two years.”      Is PoW mining inefficient? Yes. Proof-of-work is an inefficient flea in roomful of elephants.      But in the end, it makes sense for miners to use any electricity at all only if we believe that large, distributed public blockchains are a worthwhile use of energy. And guess what? Yes, they are, because they will create, and have already begun to create, colossal energy savings.    Read more: Nic Carter: The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate    New efficiencies are already here, in everything from creating markets in residential rooftop solar, in simplifying bills of lading, in keeping track of vaccine cold chains, in bond issuance and in protecting against counterfeit drugs (In Hong Kong, patients and pharmacists can use a phone app to scan the Gardasil package and get the full history of its movement from the point of import into the distribution chain for the market.) There are thousands of initiatives taking advantage of these new markets, too many to begin to count.      Blockchain technology will continue to snowball no matter how much Charlie Munger cries. It’s a tool we need to get past fossil fuels, not an impediment.      A note on NFTs as collectibles. It’s hard to understand why people who have no problem understanding fantasy football or the desirability of signed first editions or baseball cards go into total fits at the thought of NFTs.      An NFT is the imperishable receipt of a connection between you and the artifact it represents. Like I have a vintage Japanese tissue case full of ticket stubs to rock shows from the '70s and '80s. They are old bits of torn colored paper and have no intrinsic value other than to prove I saw Todd Rundgren at the Roxy.      That’s all an NFT is: the permanent record of an origin, a connection. And whether you list or buy or hold them or don’t won’t affect the environment at all, because your decision will not alter Ethereum’s current energy footprint one bit. If all the NFTs in the whole world were to blow up right now, that would represent only a small fraction of the Ethereum network’s activities, and the miners will continue to mine at the same energy cost.

The “Upbit Protection Center for Digital Asset Investors” is intended to prevent fraud, conduct research and provide legal assistance and financial support to victims of crypto-related crimes, the Korea Herald reported Thursday.  The announcement comes against the backdrop of a clampdown by South Korea’s government on crypto businesses.  Crypto exchanges in the country have until Sept. 24 to register as Virtual Asset Service Providers, allowing regulators to determine the legality of firms’ operations.  Dunamu will also start running an environmental, social and governance (ESG) management committee in 2022, headed by board director Song Chi-hying.  This is part of Dunamu’s efforts to join the global ESG trend, a growing focus for financial institutions and regulators.  In the crypto world, ESG is generally associated with the energy required in mining. However, it can also extend to how companies operate and their wider impact on society, such as association with fraud and money laundering.

Burnt Finance has raised $3 million from Injective Protocol, Multicoin Capital, Mechanism Capital and others to build a NFT platform on the Solana blockchain. Alameda Research, the prodigious Solana backer helmed by Sam Bankman-Fried, was also involved in the funding round.      As with Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain and other efforts, Burnt is looking to establish a thriving NFT market beyond the collectible sector’s traditional home: Ethereum.      A team of 10 crypto-savvy artists burned and tokenized a Banksy piece in March in a prelude to the Beeple-inspired mania that followed later that month. The tokenized remains sold for 228.69 ETH, or roughly $380,000 at the time of purchase (worth $795,000 at press time).      Read more: Burnt Banksy NFT Sells for $380K in ETH      The Burnt team, which insists on anonymity, said launching on the Solana network will help it tackle “bid manipulation” and “high minting fees” – issues the team says it experienced firsthand with its Ethereum-based OpenSea auction.      “Some actors tried to leverage the congestion and manipulate the transaction fees to sway the results and the length of the auction,” Burnt Finance said in a statement.      The Burnt team argues old-school English auction houses such as Sotheby’s take up to 25% in fees, while other NFT platforms take 5%.      “There are a lot of ways that the entire ecosystem can be improved and be fully decentralized,” Burnt said in a statement.      Burnt Finance is governed using the protocol’s native BURNT token.      “The Burnt Banksy team have helped bring NFTs to the mainstream through their activities earlier this year,” Marc Weinstein, head of portfolio development at Mechanism Capital, told CoinDesk via Telegram. “Combine this with the increasing momentum in Solana, and we believe they can become the leading NFT platform for that ecosystem.”      Other investors include Vessel Capital, Hashkey, Spartan, Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon and Polygon Chief Operating Officer Sandeep Nailwal.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | SOL | INJ | FLOW,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/06/banksy-burners-raise-3m-to-build-nft-platform-on-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d717fc9896bf3b91f51b3ad98d4417cc78b8191-1280x951.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The crypto-focused venture capital company, also the parent company of CoinDesk, is now the second-largest shareholder in blockchain company Streami, according to an emailed announcement Thursday.  The amount of the investment wasn't disclosed.  Streami is the operator of crypto exchange Gopax, which has a 24-hour trading volume of about $115 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.  The investment suggests DCG is not concerned that Gopax will be hurt by the country’s increased scrutiny of the crypto industry.  Exchanges in the country have until Sept. 24 to register as virtual asset service providers (VASPs), allowing the state to determine the legality of a company’s operations as regulators crack down on money laundering and fraud.  The head of the Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s regulator, suggested in April that all crypto exchanges in the country could be shut in September because no exchanges had registered.  The investment deal also sets up a partnership between Streami and Genesis, a digital-asset lender and DCG subsidiary, that will see Gopax harness Genesis’ liquidity pool to offer savings products.

42386649,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUSMt,1620304205,"Upshot’s NFT Appraisal Protocol Nabs $7.5M From CoinFund, Framework","Upshot, a blockchain-based protocol that offers incentives to experts to give their honest opinion, raised $7.5 million Thursday to help answer a foundational question of non-fungible token (NFT) mania: Is a Beeple artwork really worth $69 million?      NFTs are worth as much as their buyers will pay, but most digital collectibles can’t conduct price discovery the way Beeple's ""5,000 Days"" did on Christie’s auction block, said Jake Brukhman, CEO of blockchain venture firm CoinFund. That’s why he’s co-leading the bet on Upshot.      The Series A round of funding was backed by Framework Ventures, CoinFund and Blockchain Capital. It will be used for a new product called UpshotOne that solidifies Upshot’s transition to NFTs. The protocol launched in 2019 as an insurance-focused prediction market but saw more opportunity in pricing collectibles.      “There is this incredibly impactful space for peer prediction,” Brukhman said of the NFT market.      Upshot will aggregate real-time NFT appraisals by asking its decentralized user base to compare collectibles. It incentivizes honest answers: Proven “experts” get more weight to their opinions; dishonest participants get less.      “The more people that participate, the more accurate it becomes,” Brukhman said.      Over time UpshotOne could generate revenue by pairing its consensus-driven price predictions with on-chain data for a marketable application programming interface. There’s also the crypto angle: Upshot has a native incentives token atop its blockchain.      Slow Ventures partner Jill Carlson, who also invested in this round of funding, said Upshot’s peer prediction and incentivization model can also have other uses, although she said she's confident that Upshot's new product will outlive the current hype about NFTs.      “It's always exciting to me when you see a fundamentally new primitive come along that not only serves a really important function within whatever is being hyped at the moment,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/06/upshots-nft-appraisal-protocol-nabs-75m-from-coinfund-framework,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9cdb838344b47655fcad17b6438d89d15fa8a23-1500x1089.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The top cryptocurrency jumped 8% on Wednesday, erasing Tuesday's slide from $57,000 to $53,000, as the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen backtracked on comments suggesting interest rate hikes may be needed to stop the economy from overheating.  Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading near $58,000, representing a 21% gain on lows near $48,000 seen at the end of April, according to CoinDesk 20 data.  The recovery, however, has failed to subdue fears of a deeper bull market correction. The one-week put-call skew remains entrenched in the positive territory for the third straight week in a sign of persistent demand for short-term put options or bearish bets.  Traders look to be buying ""protective puts"" – purchasing puts against long bitcoin positions in the spot or futures market.  The put-call skew is a gauge of the value of puts relative to calls; a positive skew implies that demand for puts (bearish options bets) is outstripping calls (bullish bets).  The one-week put-call skew is currently hovering near 9%, having turned positive with bitcoin's drop from $60,000 to sub-$50,000 in the second half of April.  However, the options market continues to show long-term bullish with three- and six-month skews returning negative values. The one-month gauge is now hovering near zero.

42386656,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUSVh,1620295364,Ether Traders Load Up on $8K Call Options in Bet Price Will Double by July,"Prices for ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, have already quadrupled this year. Now, some options traders are betting prices could double again – by the end of next month.      Market data reveals growing demand for ether's deep out-of-the-money (OTM) call options – bullish bets with strike prices well above the spot market price of the underlying asset.      Ether has rallied from $2,000 to record highs over $3,500 in the past 10 days. On Tuesday, a single high-net-worth trader or a group of traders bought 9,000 contracts of the $8,000 call expiring June 25.      These block trades crossed the tape via the institution-focused, over-the-counter desk Paradigm and were booked on Deribit, the leading exchange for cryptocurrency options.      Theoretically, buyers of the calls are expecting the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap to rise above $8,000 by the end of June.      However, if ether continues its steep bull run for few more weeks, the price of the $8,000 call would surge, simply because the trade would be more likely to pay off. At that point, traders could sell the options in the market for a quick profit.      Whatever transpires, according to analysts, the surge in demand now for the $8,000 call implies bullish price expectations potentially linked to the network upgrade known as EIP 1559 that would reduce the pace of the net issuance of ether.      ""Investors look to be betting on continued bullish momentum in anticipation of a big drop in ether's issuance after the EIP 1559 upgrade,"" according to Laevitas, a Swiss data analytics firm for cryptocurrency markets.      Call options, or bullish bets, with strikes ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 listed on Deribit have become popular in recent weeks.      Also read: Amid New Price Highs, Ether Flips Bitcoin on Options Volume      That said, the risks are steep. With the strike price so far away, the options could easily expire worthless, and the buyers would forfeit the premiums they paid for the contracts.      Hence, buying these deeply out-of-the-money call options is often considered analogous to buying lottery tickets.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/06/ether-traders-load-up-on-8k-call-options-in-bet-price-will-double-by-july,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/250227ddabd131c2194bd7292d09bc020f51fec1-1300x975.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386642,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUSBZ,1620288000,"DeFi More Disruptive to Banks Than Bitcoin, Says ING","Netherlands-based ING Bank has been analyzing the risks and opportunities associated with the exploding decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      A paper released last month titled “Lessons Learned from Decentralised Finance,” carefully weighs some of DeFi’s pros and cons, and concludes that “the best of both worlds is achieved if centralised and decentralised financial services cooperate.”      Commenting on the paper, ING blockchain lead Herve Francois pointed out that “DeFi could be more disruptive than Bitcoin to the financial sector,” adding that the crypto-friendly Dutch lender has the ecosystem in its sights.      ""DeFi is an integral part of ING’s digital asset vision,” Francois wrote in a message to CoinDesk. “Researching into DeFi gives ING insight into what gaps might exist in the new paradigm from a micro and macro perspective.”    Read more: DeFi Is Now a $100B Sector    DeFi, the replacement of financial intermediaries with automated digital contracts, is a big deal today with around $76 billion in assets locked up on Ethereum alone.      For its part, ING Bank has shown itself to be a pioneer in the cryptocurrency space, leading work among a cohort of banks on an institutional-grade custody solution and also anti-money laundering (AML) measures for digital assets.    ING eyes DeFi    Among the lessons learned, ING pointed to a general trade-off where a reduction in counterparty risk is largely replaced by technical risks around the use of smart contracts.      However, the borderless nature of DeFi is alluring to ING, according to the paper, because centralized institutions spend a lot of time and money complying with multiple regulations in different jurisdictions.      The paper states:    “Although DeFi currently appears to be a domain on its own, we envision that centralised and decentralised financial services will converge at some stage as both have unique capabilities that are beneficial to the other. There is however the challenge for centralised institutions of making sure that their assets stay within countries that are white-listed.”    Meeting AML and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements is something financial institutions could help DeFi with, according to ING:    “This way a DeFi service could comply to AML regulation. However, as this is uncharted territory, more research is needed to determine the validity of such [cooperation] between centralised banks and decentralised financial services.”  Aave effect    ING selected decentralized lending platform Aave to carry out a case study on various characteristics of DeFi. According to ING:    “The automation of business processes in Aave on a public permissionless blockchain has many advantages over traditional money markets, such as accuracy transparency and speed. However, we argue that the benefits of cost efficiency and better security that come with automating money markets via smart contracts is debatable and introduce new technical risks.”    Aave is known to be weighing institutional DeFi opportunities, having hired some banking specialists and recently joining the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.      Asked if there was any particular reason why ING chose Aave over other DeFi platforms, Francois said, simply: “We know them.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/06/defi-more-disruptive-to-banks-than-bitcoin-says-ing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d13a4829190c8dcba4180d373abacc35a347559c-2000x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release on Wednesday, the Northern District of California entered an order authorizing the IRS to seek those who have conducted at least $20,000 in crypto transactions on the platform.      Kraken's subsidiaries and its U.S.-based parent company, Payward Ventures, are being asked by the IRS to produce records identifying U.S. taxpayers who “may have failed to comply with internal revenue laws.” A John Doe summons is a tactic used by the tax department to request information on people it can not identify by name.      The IRS is seeking the records of U.S. citizens who engaged in business with or through the exchange during the years between 2016 and 2020. Kraken is not being investigated for wrongdoing, according to the release, but the summons are an attempt to bolster the tax department's “investigation of an ascertainable group or class of persons.”      See also: State of Crypto: The IRS Sets Its Sights on Circle      Tax guidance from the IRS has been reissued outlining the treatment of cryptocurrency as property, with all the relevant accompanying federal tax burdens.
