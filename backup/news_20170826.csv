42379822,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kp2l,1503760804,Risk or Reward: How Crypto Exchanges Cash In on New Currency,"It’s not always easy to be the new kid on the block(chain).  Since it appeared online about a month ago, new cryptocurrency bitcoin cash has been under scrutiny from users, miners and investors, all intrigued by how this first large-scale hard fork in the original bitcoin network will affect them.  But it's maybe the consumer-facing businesses, namely the exchanges, that are most under pressure to make a decision, given the software development time, costs and regulatory burdens that go into supporting any new cryptocurrency with a unique blockchain.  Some, however, came to a conclusion quick. Kraken and Bitfinex, two popular exchanges, embraced Bitcoin Cash immediately after the split.  According to Jesse Powell, Kraken's founder:  ""Kraken was one of the few exchanges to say early on that we'd support bitcoin cash for both funding and trading. Many exchanges were initially undecided about the extent of their support and some even said they wouldn't support it at all. Now more exchanges have come around to say that they will support it, though some have said the support may not come for several months yet.""  Powell's comment takes a jab at Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange, which initially came out strongly opposed to listing bitcoin cash. But as bitcoin cash continued to look successful – and after many of its users complained, some even filing a lawsuit – Coinbase did an about-face.  Now, the exchange says it's working to support the currency by January 1. According to an August 3 blog post, Coinbase decided to support bitcoin cash ""based on factors such as the security of the network, customer demand, trading volumes and regulatory considerations.""  Picking sides  The varying degrees of acceptance and support for this new cryptocurrency represent deeper divisions in the bitcoin community, specifically about the vision for the future of bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) and what will make the market most stable while allowing it to grow.  ""Everybody has their own opinions on the viability of differing models,"" said Marco Santori, partner at Cooley LLP, and the leader of its fintech practice.  That debate, and questions about whether an exchange will ""onboard a new cryptocurrency… and how many people will actually want it, have created some sharp divisions in the desirability of bitcoin cash,"" he said.  For Kraken, who generally stayed out of the scaling debate as it was happening around the beginning of August, the answer was simple.  Powell said, ""We thought that the bitcoin cash fork was pretty likely to be successful and wanted our clients to benefit from it as much as possible, which means letting them trade the new tokens as soon as possible.""  Plus, the exchange saw it as a way to increase their own revenue.  Powell continued:  ""There can be a lot of price volatility around a fork and this presents a huge trading opportunity. We in fact had a rather large influx of new clients who signed up at Kraken and deposited their bitcoins with us prior to the fork so they could get their bitcoin cash and trade around this major event. Of course, we benefit too if there is a lot of trade volume so it can be a win-win for us and our clients.""  While many of Kraken's users immediately sold all their bitcoin cash, Powell said, ""for every seller, there's a buyer,"" pointing to the bitcoin cash price not just holding up, but jumping recently to more than $700.  ""There are even 'big-blockers' out there who think bitcoin cash will eventually eclipse regular bitcoin, and probably some of these folks sold all their bitcoin for bitcoin cash,"" Powell contends.  Risk or reward?  While the trading volume and revenue gleaned there seems like a positive for exchanges, there are other things, as Coinbase mentioned in its post, exchanges must be wary of.  According to Calin Calianu, a Bitcoin ABC contributor, the exchanges ""weren't sure what was going on. They were nervous. Initially exchanges were requiring 10 to 20 confirmations on blockchain until deposits could be marked as cleared.""  Recently, though, the early adopting exchanges like Kraken and Bitfinex reduced requirements to 10 or fewer confirmations. Yet, Powell said, that isn't surprising since it's always been quick to support new tokens with its ""let-the-market-decide view.""  But Calianu, who supports bitcoin cash's mission, told CoinDesk:  ""Others are being a little more cautious. It isn't the safest currency to use. There's one big miner that, if he wanted, could totally attack the network.""  He continued, stating the factoring of the risk versus the reward also characteristic of the size of the exchange.  “Some are taking the larger risk of supporting bitcoin cash because they're smaller and want to attract business [whereas] Coinbase is big and doesn't see it as a risk they want[ed] to take. They want to see first if it's worth their investment, if it's going to go anywhere,"" Calianu said.  While there could be some ideology still at play, it could also be exchange's lack the technical expertise required to support new cryptocurrencies, which take a certain amount of software development. (That is, unless they're tokens built on top of the ethereum platform).  Powell explained Kraken had to add support for the new currency pairs that needed to be enabled, as well as support for deposits and withdrawals in the new token.  ""At Kraken, we are fortunate to have the technical ability to list new assets fairly quickly, though it is by no means trivial,"" he said. ""Probably the most time-consuming part of the process is adding the new funding gateways, because we are very careful about that and have many custom security features in our wallet systems.""  Calianu seconds that, explaining that development costs can be quite expensive. He predicts to implement support for bitcoin cash could cost anywhere between $200,000 if the developers were really efficient and $1.5 million.  Exchanges ""don't want to spend the money and the several weeks development time, and then have the thing disappear the next day,"" he said.  Continuing questions  Beyond the technical infrastructure alterations, Powell points out that in the case of a fork, his exchange has had to determine answers to a bevy of other major questions, including: which trading pairs it will offer; how soon after the fork it should enable trading in the new pairs; how margin trading would be handled across the fork; and how soon after the fork Kraken would enable deposits and withdrawals in the new token.  ""At this point,"" Powell admits, ""we don't have a set policy about any of these things, and look at it on a case-by-case basis as the forks come up.""

42379828,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KpAJ,1503754698,Blockchain's 4 Biggest Assumptions,"Wendy Xiao Schadeck is a venture investor at Northzone, based in New York City. She has been following the blockchain space closely, focusing on the behavioral perspective.  In this opinion piece, Schadeck outlines her thesis on how the blockchain market is evolving, and where she believes assumptions should be challenged so as to further the tech's development.      In light of the fascination with decentralized blockchains (now termed ""crypto"") in recent months, I've been spending a lot of time trying to counterbalance the hype with critical perspectives on the technology's future.  I am not building a bear case per se, but rather looking for opposing viewpoints in order to practice quantum thinking on the topic, which in my opinion, is absolutely critical to being a successful investor in this space.  So far, there are several types of blockchain skeptics I've observed.  The spectrum ranges from those suffering from incumbent biases to those sitting in the trough of disillusionment to others who have spent real time understanding the recent developments but came out negative because of their experiences or beliefs. There are also fervent disagreements between the different blockchain communities that raise key questions.  The issues I've been looking for in the midst of all of this are not technical in nature because, in my opinion, those challenges will be solved over time, especially given the massive amount of talent this space has been able to attract and will continue to attract. I have also not focused on external factors such as regulatory risk, though they are huge concerns. I believe that signals shown so far suggest regulators are very savvy and are careful to enact new regulation.  If you've been following the space for some time, you've probably observed that opinions about decentralized blockchain are pretty binary. The reason for this is that the biggest risks faced by projects in this space are existential. There isn't a full continuum of outcomes that are easily understood or widely acknowledged.  Either you're a believer or you aren't, and a lot of it hinges on your views on the issues below. I have also searched for answers to these questions, but so far I have found no clear answers except for further experimentation and a natural evolution of the ecosystem.  Therefore, it makes sense to think of these as basic assumptions that the entire space has been built upon:  1. Mass user adoption  The first line of defense for many critics is the argument that blockchain technologies can only replicate use cases that centralized systems already achieve, and that because of this, there is no reason for the average user to switch.  While I believe that during this first phase of adoption we will see these skeuomorphic use cases, I also think we haven’t begun to understand yet what blockchain technologies can enable. The most powerful use cases for the internet didn't evolve until many years after initial adoption. However, we still have to prove adoption in the skeuomorphic period, and I think my hypothesis around adoption by investment addresses that.  The gist of it is that instead of fishing for a future application solving a future consumer pain point, we should observe how bitcoin, ethereum and the hundreds of other tokens on the market today have been achieved adoption through a similar pattern:  Initial investment due to speculation or alignment of beliefs-> Emotional commitment to the growth of the network -> Adoption -> Advocacy (and further investment on technologies built on top).  The value prop to adopters of new technology used to be limited to only having their user pain points addressed in a better way (and whatever coolness factor comes with telling their friends about it first), which is why, as VCs, we are so used to only looking for user value proposition in the traditional sense, driven by slick onboarding funnels, library completeness, etc.  The bar is much higher compared to existing solutions, thus it is true that most blockchain use cases don't deliver a differentiated value prop on those dimensions.  However, in the decentralized world, adopters of new blockchain technologies can actually make money while the network is growing by earning or investing in tokens. This psychology is unexplored territory and taps into highly motivating human forces such as greed.  However, if this hypothesis makes any sense, then we have to also assume that early adopters will not turn off later adopters (network gets too expensive/volatile to use from speculation), and that investors will ultimately become users, which brings us to our next big blockchain assumption:  2. Tokens should be entangled  Tokens have two roles – serving as both a ticket to a network's services and a vehicle for investing in a network. This means token prices are much more volatile, and that lowers its utility as a transfer of value because the price of the exchanged good or service can fluctuate quickly in a short time-span.  This effect is described well in this article authored by Marcin Rudolf:  ""Consider the following: Do you invest in a car factory by buying a lot of cars for a price much above market value? If this idea sounds weird to you check again what are you buying when you invest in app tokens. You get a right to use a network – it's like [getting] vouchers for cars instead of shares in a car production business. Do you really need those years of access to global super computer? Do you really need to make millions of transactions over the ethereum network? Probably not so you will realize your investment by dumping your tokens on secondary market. In that case, however, you should ask yourself what happens to your car factory if you first massively drive up product price by hoarding cars it produces and then dump them on secondary market?""  This creates conflicts of interest between token investors, who want the prices to go up, and spenders who want the prices to remain stable.  Assuming investors are spenders as to my earlier point, token entanglement then disincentives participants to use their tokens in exchange for the goods and services provided by the network, which makes the network useless and also the token.  In the earlier days of bitcoin, people spent bitcoin because no one believed bitcoin was real. Now, stories of the ""$5 million pizza"" make token investors incredibly weary of spending their tokens.  If we model out when investors become spenders, it is when value of services that can be bought with a token becomes more than the expected future value of the token you're holding. This will happen when token price stabilizes, and supply equals demand.  However, by that point, will there be enough development done on the network for the token to have significant utility value? If yes, then prices for using the network services will be compared to prices for doing things the centralized way.  If not, we will probably have a trough of disillusionment period during which many people sell their tokens and the true ""hodlers"" form the bottom. Which projects survive this period depend on both the speed of development and how many true ""hodlers"" exist in the network.  While most projects are not at a stage where the network can even deliver any meaningful utility value, several recent consumer-facing projects (Brave, Kik, etc.) will encounter this problem before others.  If they're able to build incentives into the product and make people spend (maybe in order to earn?), then that will be an important proof point. Also, if the end user is a machine rather than a human (in the case of pure infrastructure tokens), then the problem is less evident.  There are also a number of projects working on ""stablecoins,"" which from my limited understanding are kind of like collateralized FX swaps, but the usefulness of these will be limited in times of extreme volatility because they require huge amounts of capital to work.  3. ICOs incentivize good projects  I've been very pessimistic about ICOs as a funding mechanism (at least in its current form) because incentives for the founding team are so misaligned with the project's investors and community, and even the most prudent founding teams will have trouble allocating hundreds of millions of dollars efficiently at a pre-product stage.  History has not shown that large amounts of funding at very early stages of a project leads to successful outcomes. A more ideal distribution mechanism might be more of a helicopter drop and liquidity via decentralized exchanges or a phased, proof-point based model of token sale.  Albert Wenger wrote a good blog post on this recently where he urges projects to set up internal mechanisms for post-ICO governance. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin also wrote a blog post earlier this summer illustrating issues with single round ICOs.  Right now, it certainly feels like a race to build the largest arsenal via ICOs before clear regulatory guidance, and it is the most rational thing to do given the short term incentives, but arguably, similar to dot-com days, it might not bode positively for these projects' ability to build value for its community long run without stronger governance mechanisms.  This is also a symptom of current market conditions and should naturally self-correct when the hype dies down and investors become more critical. I am optimistic that when capital becomes scarce again, it just takes one responsible project to establish the norm, and the rest will have to follow suit because the market should negatively select against any project that doesn’t.  4. Governance paradox  This is often the most commonly cited core issue for decentralized blockchain networks. How do blockchain networks define the rules? If they can trust a central party to define the rules, then there is no need for a blockchain in the first place.  Oxford professor Vili Lehdonvirta authored a piece on this in 2016 which explains the concept really well:  ""Blockchain technologies cannot escape the problem of governance. Whether they recognize it or not, they face the same governance issues as conventional third-party enforcers. You can use technologies to potentially enhance the processes of governance (eg. transparency, online deliberation, e-voting), but you can’t engineer away governance as such. All this leads me to wonder how revolutionary blockchain technologies really are. If you still rely on a Board of Directors or similar body to make it work, how much has economic organization really changed? And this leads me to my final point, a provocation: once you address the problem of governance, you no longer need blockchain; you can just as well use conventional technology that assumes a trusted central party to enforce the rules, because you’re already trusting somebody (or some organization/process) to make the rules.""  The bitcoins scaling debate is the most well-known manifestation of this issue, and some have looked to forks as a way to define governance by means of natural selection of blockchain networks.  However, Vili argues that competition via forking does not solve the problem because strong network effects prevent competition. Building accountability into the nodes might be another solution (for example, like R3), which might limit the use case to centralized protocols or a decentralized protocol managed by a central party. These types of blockchain networks are less economically transformative.  Ultimately, more sophisticated governance mechanisms should evolve, built by others way smarter on this topic than I am. There are giant pools of knowledge in sociology, behavioral economics, etc. that are still largely untapped by those building cryptoeconomic designs, and this is where I am spending my time these days — making these connections. I am a believer that this will not be done through technology alone; our governance processes will have to evolve significantly in order for the technology to work. I would even go as far to say that blockchain technologies allow societies to rapidly prototype human coordination processes that have historically taken centuries to develop.
