42430681,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwrvh,1561672543,"Ethereum Co-Founder's Polkadot Closes Token Sale, Claims $1.2 Billion Valuation","The Web3 Foundation has closed on a private sale of tokens to fund the development of Polkadot, the ambitious blockchain interoperability project started by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood.  The Swiss nonprofit said Thursday that the 500,000 DOT tokens (5 percent of the total supply) were sold at the targeted valuation for the project of $1.2 billion, and that investors wanted more than were available. However, the foundation did not disclose the sale's proceeds, and it is not clear whether the amount raised was the full $60 million sought.  That's because, as CoinDesk reported last month, three Chinese funds agreed to pay prices that, on average, valued the project below $1 billion. None of those funds were among the investors that Web3 identified in its announcement Thursday (Placeholder, Longhash Incubator, ChainX and Innogy Corporate Ventures).  It is unclear how many of the 500,000 DOT tokens the Chinese funds bought, but the allocation was not increased, so even if all the other investors in the sale paid full price, it would stand to reason that proceeds fell shy of the target.  That said, some people close to the project have argued that the prices paid by the three Chinese funds do not reflect the market valuation, on the logic that investors can get discounts for buying in bulk or being otherwise valuable partners. Such investors may record the tokens on their balance sheet at full value, even if they paid less for them, the argument goes.  All's well that ends well?  Wood indicated he was happy with the outcome.  ""I have been struck by how much interest there is in Polkadot – many of us have sensed an immense hunger for something new to explore,"" he said in a statement. ""With this success, I look forward to seeing the W3F team put these resources to good use, supporting both Polkadot and the broader Web 3.0 ecosystem.""  Polkadot aspires to build a blockchain network that can enable other blockchains to work in conjunction with each other. The foundation says it expects to launch the network by the end of the year, with steps required to launch the network to begin in Q3.  Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder, said in Thursday's statement that Polkadot ""represents a new frontier for experimentation and creation in cryptoland. ... We expect Polkadot to not only develop a robust internal ecosystem, but also to become a bedrock network for the entirety of crypto.""

42430682,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwrph,1561672067,US Lawmakers Question Terrorist Use of Facebook Cryptocurrency,"Members of the U.S. House of Representatives questioned Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN) director Kenneth Blanco about Facebook's planned cryptocurrency Thursday.  Representatives Emanuel Cleaver, II (D-MO), Trey Hollingsworth (R-IN), Bill Foster (D-IL) and French Hill (R-AR) held a briefing with members of the House Financial Services Committee, discussing the Libra project with Blanco, who heads up FinCEN, the U.S. Treasury Department's anti-money-laundering wing.  The briefing was held as part of a broader look at how machine learning and artificial intelligence can limit illicit money laundering and related activities.  Cleaver's concern seems to stem from Facebook's alleged role in improperly storing user data and spreading misinformation over the past few years, according to a press release.  ""We’ve seen the significant damage that foreign adversaries and bad actors have wrought on our democracy through Facebook’s platform, and that was simply through messaging and advertising,"" he said in a statement, adding:  ""Before we allow such a giant corporation to begin processing millions to billions of financial transactions, we have to study these issues and ensure we have the tools and guardrails in place to deter terrorists, extremists, and/or enemies from utilizing such a platform to do harm to our nation.""  'Nefarious actors'  While the release did not reveal what Blanco's views on Libra are, or whether or how FinCEN intends to oversee the project, it did say that Cleaver's questions focused on Libra and Calibra, a new Facebook subsidiary that will develop digital wallets and other services for the cryptocurrency.  Calibra registered as a money services business with FinCEN earlier this year.  Broadly, ""nefarious actors"" are finding new ways to conduct illicit financial activities, Cleaver said in the statement, citing cryptocurrencies and other new marketplaces as tools these actors can adapt.  ""Now that we’re seeing a giant corporation like Facebook—which has already shown an inability to identify and impede these kinds of actors at an acceptable level—creating its own virtual currency called Libra, it cannot be understated the importance of Congress and financial transmitters to be proactive in utilizing the newest and most powerful technologies to ensure the financial system is not being used improperly,"" he added.  He went on to say that the briefing participants ""had a fruitful discussion"" on how the U.S. can take steps to prevent misuse.  Bipartisan backlash  Thursday's briefing comes amid wide bipartisan backlash to Facebook's cryptocurrency plan, which was formally unveiled last week.  The full House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on Libra next month, a day after the Senate Banking Committee holds its own.  Other regulators worldwide are examining the cryptocurrency, with the G7 convening a task force to investigate its implications.  Cleaver has long been concerned with potentially illegal activities conducted with cryptocurrencies. According to the release, he has called on the Bitcoin Foundation and the Chamber of Digital Commerce to find ways of preventing extremist groups from using cryptocurrencies.  He has also called on FinCEN to investigate the space, after U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller found that Russian intelligence officials used bitcoin to fund activities interfering with the 2016 presidential election.

42430687,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMws5h,1561671074,Trump Administration in Talks With Crypto Startup on Israeli–Palestinian Peace Plans,"The Trump administration has tapped Israeli crypto startup Orbs to develop blockchain solutions for the region’s longstanding political conflicts.  The disclosure comes this week from a summit convened by the White House in Bahrain to discuss the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The New York Times reported Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said investments in the Palestinian territory would be like a “hot I.P.O.” The White House is aiming to put $50 billion behind it's so-called ""Peace to Prosperity"" plan.  Orbs cofounder Netta Korin told CoinDesk in an email that her team has been “working with the U.S. Administration and the State Department … on several projects that are currently in stealth mode.”  Korin, who is also co-founder of the nonprofit Hexa Foundation focused on social-impact blockchain projects, added:  “I was invited [to Bahrain] to show the immense potential blockchain technology has to solve some of the problems governments are facing in an efficient and transparent matter.”  Korin says the approach is emblematic of “a paradigm shift” in dealing with economic aid to the Palestinian people. “Where the default used to be donations, the future will now be based on investments,” she told CoinDesk. “The solutions that are being sought after will be innovative and game-changing.”  Stepping back, Korin was one of the few Israelis to join White House advisor Jared Kushner at the Bahrain summit. American economist Kevin Hassett even floated the idea of using blockchain technology to resolve land title disputes in the Palestinian territories, which perhaps overlook the fact such conflicts generally involve the Israeli military.  Previously, an anonymous source with knowledge of Israeli–Palestinian diplomatic relations told CoinDesk that blockchain solutions for tracking capital flows in the Palestinian territories have been discussed over the past year.  In particular, the source said, a meeting last October with U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Sigal Mandelker and several representatives from the Bank of Israel and the Israeli Finance Ministry explored such blockchain solutions. There were no Palestinians present at the meeting, the anonymous source said, although the Palestinian Monetary Authority is also reportedly exploring blockchain solutions.  Meanwhile, personal ties between the Israeli crypto industry and government bodies continue to deepen. Korin was previously an advisor to the Israeli Ministry of Defense, General Yoav Mordechai. Plus, Korin’s husband is Nadav Shemesh, a former aide to the Israeli Ministry of Finance Moshe Kahlon. This is hardly unique in Israel. For example, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s niece and nephew, Guy and Galia Ben-Artzi, are co-founders of the blockchain startup Bancor.  Danny Brown Wolf, head of partnerships at Orbs and former advisor with Israel's United Nations delegation, told CoinDesk that although ""no one thinks technology can solve the conflict"" blockchain solutions could help distribute humanitarian aid to Palestinians and ""support economic development.""  On the surface, it appears not much has changed since the meetings last fall, as the Palestinian Authority boycotted this week’s Bahrain summit. Although Korin declined to name any specific Palestinian partners or project plans, she said her team is working with Palestinians “on both the design of these projects and the implementation on the ground.”  Palestinian tech-industry leaders did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment. We will update the article if we hear back.

42430678,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwrlh,1561669202,Grin Developers Agree to Alter Technical Development Roadmap,"The privacy-oriented Grin token held a developers’ meeting where they agreed to hold off on making changes to planned proof-of-work updates for the foreseeable future.  In a move intended to give ASIC manufacturers a return on investment on the chips they have already built, a previously scheduled phase out of Cuckatoo32s chips will be delayed until past 2021.  After a public turnaround on the viability and inevitability of single chip ASICs – citing the improvements to heat density, lowered upfront costs, and potentially reduced electrical costs – of the technological usurpation, Grin is no longer supporting the mass-market miners that were compelled by market forces to run GPUs.  The team had originally pledged to keep single chip ASICs “at bay,” but now that Grin-specific ASICs, differentiated by the SHA256 ASICs, have advanced to a position of market dominance and affordability, the team has committed only to eliminate Cuckatoo31s from the roster.  “In short, preventing single chip ASICs no longer seems worthwhile or feasible, but an earlier version of me thought it was, which had led me to the phase-outs,” wrote Grin developer John Tromp.  Three foundries, Samsung, TSMC, and Intel should be able to produce the increasingly efficient Cuckatoo32 ASICs, said Tromp, whose backing hopes will provide the manufacturers with the confidence to continue production.  Tromp is “90 percent” certain the C32s are ready for deployment, but noted if “in [the] worst case, primary graphrate will fall, and GPU miners will be happy to pick up slack with secondary.” All that is certain is that, “c31 phaseout is a foregone conclusion.”  He wrote to CoinDesk, Cuckatoo31s, “currently have a weight of 2^8*31=7936, will see this weight linearly reduced starting around Jan 15, 2020, over the coarse of 31 weeks, to 2^8*0 = 0, at which point it's effectively gone, leaving only C32.”  The developers also noted that in time if reason arises to decouple Cuckatoo31s, a simple code upgrade will enable Cuckatoo33s to supplant the outdated technology. Though this decision would also be delayed by an 18 month period of deliberation.  Additional updates  Prominent developer Yeastplume said, “First, as you know, 2.0.0 is just around the corner, which is our first scheduled hard fork (or you can call it a 'network upgrade' if you prefer). Fortunately for our current situation, this is a forced upgrade, which means that all users of Grin will have to upgrade their software to the 2.0.0 release.”  Yeastplume’s efforts to ensure adoption come after months of incompatibility within the network caused by a previous update that did not receive total adoption. ""For whatever reasons many users and particularly exchanges haven't been keeping up with the latest versions of Grin,” he wrote, which caused miscommunication between Grin and their wallets.  To ensure complete compliance, Yeastplume said that, “all current versions of Grin will stop working as of the HF block in a few weeks,” hoping it won’t come as a surprise when user’s nodes quit.  He also motioned towards coming changes in governance structure, including a request-for-comments period that seeks more community involvement, as well as slower roll outs of planned upgrades.  Additionally, he said the 2.0.0 code is “much better at doing version checks and the software should be better at explicitly informing users of potential incompatibilities, which we hope will greatly help when we do have to introduce new features to support upcoming technologies.

The Shapeshift CEO commented on Facebook's cryptocurrency project from a personal perspective at the Bitcoin2019 event, declaring that even though Libra doesn't exist yet, there's a space for it in his platform.  ""It's too early because it doesn't exist yet but I would love to integrate Libra into ShapeShift when it does exist,"" Voorhees said.  The cryptocurrency and blockchain entrepreneur explained that his interest in Libra depended on how well the project would work.  ""The really interesting thing about Libra is what rules are based on it,"" he said.  Voorhees also had a few concerns, pointing out that what its presented in Libra's white paper could change when the project actually launches.  ""So, fundamentally it's based on a relatively decentralized worldview, but that could be very different when it actually launches versus what's been reported,"" he said.  He also assessed the control Libra could give to users from a technical aspect.  ""We will see how freely it can move. For example, does someone need permission to integrate it into something?"" Voorhees asked.  Gateway To Bitcoin  Libra could also serve as a way to usher in broader bitcoin adoption.  The entrepreneur explained that Libra's value could surpass the dollar's, making it a more attractive form of payment.  ""I'm very excited that Libra isn't just on a one-on-one parity with the dollar,"" he said.  Voorhees also said that Libra could make Facebook users more open to digital currencies.  ""One of the effects is that people, specially Americans, will start to get more comfortable with a coin that is a little bit more powerful versus the dollar,"" he said.  On the other hand, the use of Libra is also a way for new users to get into bitcoin and to get used to price volatility.  ""It's price will vary, but nothing like bitcoin's,"" he said. ""People will realize that is OK to have an asset that moves, and indeed there isn't an asset in the world that doesn't move.""

""The wallet will be the delivery vehicle for many financial services starting with personal payments, but expanding to online and offline commerce and eventually lending and personal financial management,"" the job description says.  The blockchain team is also recruiting legal and regulatory firepower in the form of a lead commercial counsel; a lead product counsel; a lead international blockchain counsel in Singapore who will be in charge of compliance across various jurisdictions; and a public policy manager, who will provide ""payments and blockchain regulatory policy development.""

The list also includes security engineers and UX researchers.  Last week, Facebook formally unveiled its vision for Libra, a price-stable cryptocurrency intended to bring billions into the global financial system, with companies like Visa, Mastercard, Uber, Lyft, and PayPal on board.  The reveal riled politicians and regulators around the world, with the G7 creating a task force to study Libra's implications, the U.S. Congress scheduling hearings for July 16 and 17 and the Bank of England's president promising the project would receive proper scrutiny.

The new Gemini employees will be focused on supporting the exchange's primary products, including its professional trading platforms and custody solution.  Gemini co-founder and CEO Tyler Winklevoss told CoinDesk that the Chicago engineering team ""has deep expertise in matching engines and marketplaces.""  ""They’ll be primarily focused on that and building the core platform for our exchange and trading services that already exists,"" he said, adding:  ""When we think about our exchange we start with reliability, speed, robustness, but also the product offerings so we don’t have a specific deadline I can give you in terms of what we’re targeting but we’re continuing to build out our product offering.""  Prior to Coinbase, some of the new Gemini engineers worked at CME Group and other trading firms. They include product manager Andrew Page, who announced his hiring on LinkedIn and before taking the plunge into crypto worked seven years at Connamara Systems, a capital markets software firm.  Expansion plans  While Gemini is currently a spot exchange that lists five assets (bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, zcash and litecoin), Winklevoss said the company is looking to increase the number of order types on the platform, as well as ""the way people can trade these assets.""  The exchange now has roughly 200 employees in Portland, Oregon and New York, in addition to the new Chicago branch.  In a statement, Winklevoss said Gemini has been ""focused on building an institutional-grade platform ... from day one.""  ""[We] are continually investing in talent that will help us realize this"" he said. ""Chicago, one of the world’s major financial centers, is a natural place for us to be.

42403028,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeIJZ,1561644016,Snowden: 'The Most Important Thing Bitcoin Is Missing Right Now Is Privacy',"Bitcoin's biggest flaw is its lack of privacy, said Edward Snowden at the Bitcoin 2019 conference.  The cybersecurity expert noted the importance of privacy as a source of liberty.  “The lack of privacy is an existential threat to bitcoin. Is the only protection users have from political change,” Snowden said.  Snowden also stated that he was a bitcoin supporter and even used an encrypted service that he paid for with bitcoins in order to communicate with journalists in 2013.  Threats to and From Exchanges  Talking about his experience being pursued by the United States government for sharing NSA data, Snowden pointed out the unrealistic expectations from regulators who want to be in control of cryptocurrencies.  Going in-depth about the regulations from banks and governments, Snowden also exposed the necessity for exchanges to defend their users' privacy. He fears that if one of the exchanges gave up information, soon all of them would follow.  “If you actually go into the terms of big exchanges like Coinbase, they only want to cover themselves. They expose you, they close your account and keep your funds,"" Snowden said.  He also disliked the development of financial cryptocurrency services, claiming that many of them are starting to look too much like banks.  “Something unforgivable is that you guys keep developing services trying to be banks, and the world doesn’t need more banks,” he said.  Leave No Trace  Snowden also talked about the Shadow Brokers, a group of hackers that auctioned NSA information in exchange for bitcoin in 2016.  He noted that the hacking case was the starting point of a governmental war on cryptocurrencies. In short, he said, regulation doesn't work unless it becomes overly intrusive.  “If tracking bitcoin was possible then the NSA would have caught them,” he said. He said Satoshi Nakamoto was in the same position: he could navigate the system and leave no trace.  “If you know how the system works, you can still have privacy,” he said.

42403025,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeIGc,1561640422,Galaxy Digital Leads $5.5 Million Round for Contract Management Startup,"Digital contract management startup Clause has raised $5.5 million in a Series A round led by crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital.  The funding round also saw investment from electronic signature pioneer DocuSign and Galaxy Digital's EOS Venture Capital Fund, which is backed by EOS blockchain maker Block.one and other investors.  Founded in 2016, Clause offers blockchain-based solutions to facilitate the creation, storage and maintenance of digital contracts for businesses. However, it also offers clients these same services independent of blockchain technology – by using existing platforms such as Stripe or PayPal.  ""Clause is a system that doesn't rely on a particular blockchain,"" the company's founder and CEO, Peter Hunn, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It's blockchain-agnostic and also blockchain-independent. What we mean by that is you can run Clause without the blockchain infrastructure at all. You could just have a contract that you sign using an e-signature service that then initiates a payment through Stripe or PayPal that you connect to that agreement.""  At the same time, Hunn says there are several unique benefits to facilitating digital contract execution on a blockchain. Namely, using a blockchain creates immutable audit trails for contract performance.  ""One of the biggest problems with contract management today is that you really have no visibility into the events that occur under a contract after the point of signature,"" Hunn said. ""You really only have a record of the agreement at the point of signature. You don't have a record of these post-signature events and that creates a lot of transaction costs.""  Today's announcement of Clause's Series A is not the first major fundraising round for the company. Back in 2017, the startup raised just over $2 million from lead investors BN Capital at Lerer Hippeau and London-based Seedcamp, which both participated again in the Series A.  Galaxy Digital's Greg Wasserman and Mike Dinsdale will both be joining Clause's board of directors.  ""They both bring a wealth of enterprise experience,"" Hunn told CoinDesk. ""[Their] experience is very useful for Clause as it begins to grow into a much larger organization.""  Looking ahead, Hunn said the partnership with DocuSign will lead to new features.  Said Hunn:  ""One of the big innovations we're working on with DocuSign is the ability to extend DocuSign functionality from not just e-signature but also to perform other events you may want to do within DocuSign [natively].""

42403019,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeIAi,1561638641,Kakao's Klaytn Blockchain Has Gone Live With Support From Major Firms,"The Klaytn blockchain from the fold of South Korean messaging app giant Kakao has just gone live.  Kakao's blockchain arm Ground X announced the mainnet launch Thursday in an emailed press release, saying that Klaytn aimed to bring about mass adoption of blockchain services and to ""substantiate the value and utility of blockchain technology.""  The firm touts the network as having a speedy response time on the level of legacy web services, based on the feedback from the partners via a public testnet trial announced last October. Stability has been verified with different security companies using ""high-intensity"" testing, the firm said, while blind testing for developers and users helped Ground X improve the Klaytn user experience.  Ground X has also announced that nine blockchain projects – including HintChain, a blockchain-based food data marketplace; Antube, a video snippet entertainment service; and Pibble, which rewards users in cryptocurrency for all their social media activities – are to be successively released on Klaytn by the beginning of July. Additionally, a number of blockchain-powered game services developed by three ""major"" game studios are to join Klaytn.  According to its white paper, the Klaytn blockchain takes a hybrid approach that adopts the concepts of consensus nodes (CNs) and ranger nodes (RNs) to achieve both scalability and transparency.  CNs are invited partners on the network that together form a private blockchain to batch and confirm transactions by running a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm, the paper says. Anyone from the public can connect to the network and participate as a RN, who are assigned the duty of double checking blocks that have been propagated by CNs.  In today's release, Ground X describes new details of the consensus mechanisms, saying:  ""Further, in order to encourage service providers to maintain a stable network, Klaytn features transparent evaluation and incentive mechanisms called Proof of Contribution (PoC) and Klaytn Improvement Reserve (KIR). PoC assesses the contribution level of all economic entities within the Klaytn ecosystem and provides KLAY token that correspond to each entity’s level of contribution. KIR, on the other hand, is allocated for anybody committed to maintaining sustainable ecosystem growth through various activities such as platform research or community events.""  Ground X notably raised $90 million in a private coin offering back in March.  The subsidiary said in the release that, alongside the mainnet launch, it's announcing a ""governance council"" to oversee the blockchain network's development and operations. Already, it says, major firms such as LG, Big Pharma firm Celltrion and Philippines bank UnionBank are taking places on the council.  Ground X says:  ""The Council consists of 19 global top-tier companies that have successfully produced massive user-based popular services in various industry domains including IT, telecommunications, content, games, and finance. They are also key business units of some of Asia’s largest companies. ... As key decision makers for key business and technical agenda, the Council members are responsible for operating the consensus node network. Further, they plan to develop Klaytn-based services or implement blockchain to existing services to drive the mass adoption of blockchain technology.""

42403038,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeITP,1561633229,Bitcoin Drops Below $12K After Biggest Daily Price Move Since January 2018,"View  Bitcoin’s price volatility, as represented by the daily trading range, jumped to a 17-month high on Wednesday.  The cryptocurrency has dropped from $13,880 to $11,200 in the last 15 hours and could slide further to $10,000, according to the bearish setup on the hourly chart.  A possible falling channel breakout on the hourly chart would open the doors to a retest of Wednesday’s high of $13,880.  The outlook on the long duration charts remains bullish.      Bitcoin is witnessing a technical correction a day after printing the biggest one-day trading range since January 2018.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $11,780, representing a 15 percent drop from the 17-month high of $13,880 hit on Wednesday.  The double-digit pullback has come after a near 90-degree price rise from $7,500 to $13,800 in the 17 days to June 26 and looks like nothing more than a technical correction.  After all, indicators were flashing extremely overbought conditions 24-hours ago. For instance, the widely tracked 14-week relative strength index was hovering at levels last seen in January 2018, as discussed yesterday.  However, despite the pullback, BTC is still up 183 percent on a quarter-to-date basis, its best three-month performance since the final quarter of 2017.  What’s even more notable is that the magnitude of the daily price moves is reminiscent of the cryptocurrency market frenzy of January 2018.  The spread between the daily price high and low was $2,041 on Wednesday – the highest since Jan. 17, 2018. Back then, BTC witnessed a trading range of $2,275 with prices printing a high and low of $11,678 and $9,402, respectively, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  The daily trading range has jumped above $2,000 for the first time in over 17 months.  The $4,110 spread seen on Dec. 22, 2017, is the highest to date.  The average daily trading range of $358 seen so far this quarter marks a 311-percent rise on the average daily range of $87 seen in Q1.  Volatility, as represented by daily price range, has surged in the second quarter and may remain high in coming months, with experts predicting a parabolic rise to fresh record highs over $20,000.  Bitcoin, however, may witness a deeper short-term correction in the next day or two, according to the intraday charts.  Hourly chart  The cryptocurrency has established a bearish lower-highs and lower-lows pattern (falling channel) in the last 24 hours on the back of growing sell volumes (red bars).  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) is now reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print.  Supporting the case for a deeper correction is the violation of the 50-hour moving average support. Throughout the recent rally from $7,500 to $13,800, dips to or below the 50-hour MA ended up reversing the pullback with a move to fresh multi-month highs.  BTC, therefore, could penetrate the support at $11,247 (horizontal line) and slide toward $10,300–$10,000.  A drop below $11,247, however, may remain elusive if the price breaks higher from the falling channel, in which case a retest of $13,800 could be seen.  It is worth noting that a deeper pullback to $10,000, if any, will likely be transient, as the long duration charts are still biased bullish.  Daily and monthly charts  The bullish higher-lows and higher-highs structure is intact on both the daily and weekly charts.  The 5- and 10-day MAs continue to trend north, indicating a bullish setup, and could restrict losses. The averages are currently located at $11,666 and $10,713.  Both the falling channel breakout and the bullish crossover of the 5- and 10-month MAs also indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side.

42403022,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeIDf,1561630231,Singapore's Central Bank Wants More Information on Facebook's Libra Crypto,"Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is seeking more information from Facebook about its recently unveiled cryptocurrency project, Libra.  As reported by Bloomberg, MAS managing director Ravi Menon said at a media briefing on Thursday that his institution has held talks with the social media giant over concerns about how Libra would function, although he acknowledged there are potential benefits too.  Currently, MAS is having trouble deciding on how to categorize Libra in terms of regulation. ""At this point we are not sure yet,” Menon said.  Regarding the possible benefits, he said that Libra ""offers a very interesting proposition that could help to address” existing “expensive, inefficient, sometimes risky” methods of remittance.  However, MAS needs more information to gauge these benefits over existing electronic payments systems. The regulator needs to understand ""how exactly it’s going to work."" Menon said, including aspects such as Libra's economics, security and privacy.  Menon's comments come as the latest in a line of global regulators to state that more information is needed to understand the benefits and risks of Libra.  Authorities in Italy, the U.K. and France have recently indicated that Libra raises issues that must be examined.  Over in the U.S., the House Financial Services Committee will host a hearing on Facebook’s libra cryptocurrency next month, just a day after the Senate Banking Committee holds its own hearing.  Maxine Waters, chair of the powerful House committee, has raised concerns that Facebook's token could ultimately rival the dollar, while French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has said it's “out of question’’ that Libra be allowed to “become a sovereign currency. It can’t and it must not happen.”  As a result, France is creating a task force within the Group of Seven (G7) nations to examine the issues.

In a Medium post published Thursday, the Koinex exchange says it's been forced to shutter its services as a de facto ban on banking relationships for crypto firms – ordered by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in April 2018 – has meant that it is economically unfeasible to continue with normal business.  The exchange writes:  ""We have consistently been facing denials in payment services from payment gateways, bank account closures and blocking of transactions for trading of digital assets. Even for non-crypto transactions like payment of salary, rent and purchase of equipment, our team members, service providers and vendors have had to answer questions from their respective banks — just because of an association with a digital assets exchange operator. ""  While the RBI banking ban is being challenged in the Supreme Court, a lack of clear direction from the government has meant that the case is currently in limbo until a decision is made.  Last September, India's then-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Zebpay, was also forced to shut down citing the RBI restrictions.  A government panel has reportedly been meeting to try and decide a path forward for crypto regulation in India with total prohibition being possibly on the table.  Koinex further said that a news report about proposed Indian legislation called the ‘Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019’ has created nervousness among customers and caused trading to further drop off.  The article ""has created enough FUD in the Indian crypto trading community to result into a sharp decline in trading volumes and [instill] a clear discomfort for all the law-abiding citizens of this great nation.""  As a result of the difficulties, the exchange permanently ceased trading services at 2.00 p.m. local time (08:30 UTC) Thursday, June 27.  Koinex explained:  ""A snapshot of the wallet balances at this time will be taken for record, and the effort to disburse [Indian rupee] balances will begin immediately. Since the bank accounts with user funds are still frozen and the capital is held up, we have made arrangements for funds from our own resources, so that we return as much as we possibly can, back to our users and alleviate their position in reference to the funds held up in these frozen accounts.""  It also pointed out that this action is voluntary, and is ""being undertaken ... only with a view to reduce the hardship that it is causing to so many of the users who reposed faith and supported our business effort while things were not constrained.""  The exchange added:  ""This is our way of saying ‘thank you’ and bidding adieu.""

Bitcoin is designed to adjust its mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks (approximately 14 days), based on the amount of computing power deployed to the network. This is done to ensure the block production interval at the next period will remain constant at around every 10 minutes. When there are fewer machines racing to solve math problems to earn the next payout of newly created bitcoin, difficulty falls; when there are more computers in the game, it rises.  Right now the machines are humming furiously. Bitcoin miners across the world have been performing calculations at an average 56.77 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s) over the last 14 days to compete for mining rewards on the world’s first blockchain, according to data from mining pool BTC.com.  BTC.com data further indicates the average bitcoin mining hash rate in the last 24-hour and three-day periods were 59.58 EH/s and 59.70 EH/s, respectively, even higher than the average 56.77 EH/s from May 15 to June 27, or any 14-day data in the network's history.  Similarly, data from blockchain.info also shows the aggregate of bitcoin computing power was around 66 EH/s as of June 22, surpassing last year's record high of 61.86 EH/s tracked by the site, and has more than doubled since December 2018 when the hash rate dropped to as low as 31 EH/s amid bitcoin’s price fall.  Assuming all such additional computing power has come from more widely used equipment such as the AntMiner S9, which performs calculations at an average rate of 14 tera hashes per second (TH/s), that suggests more than 2 million units of mining equipment may have been switched on over the past several months. (1 EH/s equals to 1 million TH/s)  The increase in capacity is also in line with bitcoin’s price jump over the first half of 2019, which caused the price of second-hand mining equipment to double in China, and also juiced demand for new machines.  BTC.com further estimates the bitcoin mining difficulty will jump by another seven percent at the beginning of the next adjustment cycle, which would be the first time for bitcoin mining difficulty to cross the eight trillion threshold.  Delayed plugging in  Such computing interest comes at a time when mining farms in China, especially in the country’s mountainous southwest, have been gradually plugging in equipment as the rainy summer approaches.  According to a report published by blockchain research firm Coinshare, as of earlier this month, 50 percent of the global bitcoin computing power was located in China’s Sichuan province.  However, it's important to note that this year, the arrival of the rainy season in China's southwest has been delayed by nearly a month compared to previous years. As a result, some local mining farms were only running less than half of their total capacity in the past month.  Xun Zheng, CEO of mining farm operator Hashage based in Chengdu that owns several facilities across China's southwestern provinces, said there had been no rain in the area for over 20 days since early May, which was ""unusual.""  ""In the past years, it usually starts raining continuously throughout May so [hydropower plants] normally will have enough water resources by early June,"" he said.  As a result, in early June his firm was only operating at 40 percent of capacity; it can host more than 200,000 ASIC miners. But as the rain has arrived gradually over the past two weeks, the proportion has climbed to over 60 percent.  Mining farms in China previously estimated that the total hash rate this year during the peak of the rainy season around August could break the threshold of 70EH/s. That means another 300,000 units of mining machines could be further activated, assuming all are AntMiner S9s or similar models.  Those waiting to be switched on will also include new capital in the sector such as Shanghai-based Fundamental Labs, a blockchain fund that has invested $44 million on top-of-the-line mining equipment, which will be activated in June.

42403027,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeIIa,1561604434,Ethereum Tokens to Trade on Swiss Stock Exchange via R3 Tech,"Public blockchain tokens will soon be trading on a major securities exchange.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Swiss security token firm BlockState plans to ""passport"" half a dozen ERC-20 tokens from ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain, to Corda, the private distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform developed by R3.  Before the end of the year, the tokens will be locked up in a smart contract on ethereum and ""mirrored"" versions of them will run on Corda. This is akin to global depository receipts, where shares of a company are held in custody in one country and a certificate representing ownership of them is traded in another.  What's more, the passporting will take place on the network R3 is building for the Swiss Digital Exchange (SDX) – part of SIX, Switzerland’s national stock exchange and the world's 13th largest.  “BlockState has seen that exchanges and market infrastructure providers are building new digital infrastructure on Corda so they are jumping in,"" said David Nicol, R3's head of digital assets. “The way they are going to do that is with SDX, by issuing tokens that were on ethereum onto Corda.”  The reason for doing this is to open a wider market for issuers of security tokens, including institutional investors who don't want to bother managing an ethereum wallet and would rather leave custody to SDX.  “A retail investor probably wouldn't go through a financial institution connected to a regulated secondary market if he is also able to just hold an ERC-20 token in custody,"" said Blockstate CEO Paul Claudius. ""So I think this is bringing together these two investor ecosystems.”  SIX declined to comment but has previously said it plans to tokenize existing financial instruments as well as list new digital assets, including areas like real estate and fine art, beginning this year.  Building bridges  Such convergence of public and private blockchains shows how the industry has changed since a few years ago when ethereum and R3 stood at opposite ends of the decentralization spectrum.  The former was open to all comers while R3's Corda was designed with banks and regulated entities in mind. The two communities were also highly critical of each other, with R3 calling public blockchains unfit for enterprise use and ethereum devs dismissing R3 as a glorified workflow database.  But there were signs of change afoot a year ago when open-source developers began working on an equivalent of ethereum's ERC-20 standard to create tokens representing various assets on Corda.  Now, BlockState’s own security token offering (STO), which is underway, will be the first pilot integration into Corda. There are five more issuances planned, the next from Streetlife, an ""urban music and lifestyle"" company. Other sectors where BlockState will tokenize assets include real estate and sustainable energy.  As well as issuing tokens onto Corda, BlockState is registering them as securities in Switzerland, known for its conducive regulations and vast network of private banking, family offices and high net worth investors ready to buy newfangled digital assets.  “It’s a regulatory-friendly way to register securities,” noted Nicol. “You can go straight on to a blockchain and you can regulate that system of record. And in a space where the ability to execute is almost everything, they [BlockState] are really flying.”  Claudius explained that Swiss capital markets laws have “uncertified shares” where the share can be connected directly to a token, a digital representation of the ownership rights of the share with the shareholder register basically kept on the blockchain.  “Swiss regulations are technology-agnostic,” said Claudius. “The issuing of uncertified shares doesn’t require a global paper-based ledger which is dematerialized by a central securities depository. Since this is not necessary, they don’t really care how you manage your shareholder register – you can do it on a piece of paper or on a DLT.”  Paul Claudius image via Blockstate.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/27/ethereum-tokens-to-trade-on-swiss-stock-exchange-via-r3-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/186fafd45d859312cf1eed8764fab66a6f460a79-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403034,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeIPT,1561602555,"Bitcoin Price Gains for 8th Straight Session, Extending 2019’s Longest Streak","Bitcoin’s meteoric 2019 rally may have shown signs of cooling Wednesday, but that didn’t stop the cryptocurrency from ending the day in the green.  In fact, the price of bitcoin ended yesterday’s session with its eighth consecutive day in the green, closing up by more than $1,200 on the day’s open of $11,375 and ending just below $13,000.  The streak is a record for 2019, passing the six Green candles seen between June 12 to June 17 as the only other significant run of multi-day gains.  Still, that’s not to say that streak isn’t in jeopardy heading into Thursday’s session.  At 20:00 UTC on June 26, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, dropped by more than $2,000 in just under 30 minutes amid a service outage at major U.S. exchange provider Coinbase.  However, with Coinbase's fix implemented, bitcoin's (BTC) price is also back up above $12,588 at press time, after dropping to a temporary low of $11,754.  BTC is currently changing hands for $12,827, as per CoinMarketCap data.  As can be seen above, the sharp sell-off from the 24-hour high at $13,785 brought prices to a local low of $11,710 before opportunistic traders picked up a cheaper bid and drove the prices higher, back toward $13,000 at around 23:31 UTC, 29 minutes before the daily close.  Total daily volume for BTC has also shown up in a big way with the world's largest exchange, Binance, posting record-high trading volume in Tether (USDT) terms over a 24-hour period. Other exchanges such as Bitstamp and Coinbase are posting 500-day highs in total daily volume for June 26, with over 81.2 million BTC traded in a single day on those exchanges.  What's more impressive, if data from CoinMarketCap is to be believed, over 45.9 billion BTC were traded during June 26's trading period amounting to some of the highest levels ever recorded.  Its “Real 10” volume – a metric that takes into account trading volume from exchanges reporting honest volume figures as identified in a report by Bitwise Asset Management – currently stands at $46.17 billion, a small difference, according to Messari.io.  Meanwhile, other notable currencies such as Cardano (ADA), bitcoin cash (BCH) and Ether (ETH) are also back on the rise, up between 1.7 and 7.72 percent, respectively amid strong volume.  Also worth noting, the total market capitalization for the entire cryptocurrency market has recovered by more than $21.7 billion, up from $351.8 billion to stand at $373.5 billion.
