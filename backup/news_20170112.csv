42379160,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFXF,1484253623,Just 7 People Complained to the CFPB About Bitcoin in 2016,"New data shows American consumers filed a total of just seven complaints with the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in 2016.  The CFPB was created in the wake of the financial crisis of the late 2000s as part of a bid to more closely scrutinize financial products and services in the US. The agency began accepting complaints related to digital currencies in August 2014.  Now, student loan marketplace LendEDU has scraped data from the CFPB's public complaints database, finding that, of the nearly 190,000 complaints filed over the course of 2016, only seven of them related to digital currency services. Four of those were filed against Coinbase while three were submitted against Circle.  According to the CFPB database, only one complaint – filed against Coinbase on 29th November – is in-progress, whereas the remaining six were closed.  The amount of complaints in other categories dwarfs those in the virtual currency bracket. For example, LendEDU found that 43,841 complaints were made regarding credit reporting; 40,965 for mortgages; and 39,759 for debt collection.  But why the low number, compared to the others?  The data could simply be reflective of a relatively low number of consumers using bitcoin services. Conversely, consumers may not know that the CFPB – itself only a five-year-old agency – even takes complaints related to the tech, meaning that other parts of the government could be on the receiving end of complaints.  Still, in its blog post, LendEDU noted that the data suggests authorities don’t have much to investigate.  ""Fortunately for consumers, virtual currency doesn't seem to be a huge issue,"" the company said. ""Or at least not an issue garnering too many complaints.""  The findings echo past deep-dives into the CFPB data in this area.  The nonprofit advocacy group Coin Center reported in July of last year that a review of complaint data from 2011 through 2015 revealed 37 complaints filed against companies in the digital currency space, including Coinbase as well as other firms like the now-defunct GAW Miners and Butterfly Labs, among a number of others.

42379168,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFcH,1484242218,A Chinese Bitcoin Startup Has Stopped Some Services Due to Central Bank Concerns,"A long-running bitcoin investment platform is shifting gears in light of new regulatory scrutiny in China.  BTC123, established in 2011, announced today that it would halt deposits for a financial management system denominated in bitcoin and the yuan beginning on 26th January. The company is also retooling an interest-generating feature on the site, lowering rates that users can earn effective tomorrow.  In the blog post, the company cited regulatory requirements in China, naming the People’s Bank of China (the country’s central bank) and the Ministry of Public Security (China’s main policy authority), when explaining the changes.  Ricardo Zhang, CEO of BTC123, said that his company is retooling its strategy in light of the shifting regulatory environment. However, Zhang said the startup had not been contacted directly by the central bank.  Echoing other domestic bitcoin services, Zhang said that the site would adhere to any regulations required by the Chinese government.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Our main business will be in accordance with the Chinese government['s] laws and regulations.""  BTC123's shift comes after the company announced a new round of funding via the social media platform Weibo when, on 29th December, the site said it had raised 10 million yuan (roughly $1.5m at press time).  In addition to offering financial management and price data from major Chinese exchanges, BTC123 also offers news and information related to bitcoin and blockchain tech.  The development is the first sign that increased scrutiny by regulators in China may be having an effect on bitcoin-related services in the country.  Last week, word emerged that representatives from major Chinese bitcoin exchanges had met with officials from the PBoC. Subsequent reporting revealed that regulators in China were moving to monitor exchange activities more closely (though there is debate about the impact of the move).  Exchanges in China have since called for a balanced regulatory approach, while local traders have reported they are largely unconcerned by the developments.  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

That project, which officially launched in October, has been used to conduct more than 100 live transactions, the bank said earlier this week. Relying on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, the system enables PSBC to track the direction of investments, with smart contracts being used to check compliance with the agreements underpinning those investments.  The bank  , founded in the mid-2000s, specializes in retail commercial banking, and according to The Wall Street Journal, serves more than half a billion customers and runs more than 40,000 branches across China.  Those involved with the initiative say the blockchain system eliminates the need for the bank to conduct multiple credit verifications for a prospective customer, thereby reducing operational processing times by as much as 80%.  Simply put, the tech helps the bank trust the information it is receiving.  An IBM representative explained to CoinDesk:  ""Previously, the investment direction was completed by each participant independently, without a unanimous judgement standard. With the adoption of blockchain, decisions are now made on the basis of unified standard. This solves the mutual trust issue among multiple participants.""  The partnership is the latest blockchain initiative in China for IBM.  In October, IBM unveiled a blockchain pilot developed in conjunction with global retail giant Walmart and Beijing's Tsinghua University focused on supply chains for pork products.  The firm is also working with China UnionPay, a domestic credit card processor, to create a blockchain system for trading customer loyalty points.

The lab, based in the Wall Street district, is the second formal blockchain-focused lab opened by the consultancy after its Ireland division launched a similar facility in Dublin last May.  More than 20 developers and specialists will be based out of the New York lab, Deloitte said, focusing on a clientele that will, at least initially, draw primarily from the area’s financial services industry – though the firm said that the lab will see it work with companies from other sectors as well.  2016 saw Deloitte work with a number of companies in the finance space, including a group of Japanese banks that undertook an interbank payments trial using blockchain and released their initial findings in December.  Deloitte principal Eric Piscini said in a statement:  “Financial institutions have the power and ability to move blockchain to the next level. To get there, companies will need to move away from churning out proofs of concept and begin producing and implementing solutions. That’s a big part of the goal with Deloitte’s blockchain lab.”  Additionally, the New York facility is the first of several further labs focused on blockchain development that the firm has scheduled for launch over the course of 2017.

42379158,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFUj,1484227701,What Central Bank? China's Big Bitcoin Traders Are All-In On Bitcoin,"Despite recent reports that suggest China's central bank is casting a critical eye on domestic bitcoin exchanges, local traders remain largely unfazed.  In conversations with CoinDesk, members of the country's bitcoin trading community, as well as cryptocurrency exchange operators who were not involved in the talks, expressed their belief that the increased oversight of the industry will be a boon for the technology in the long term.  Over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong, who says he trades 250 BTC (or about $150,000) in the digital currency daily, said in interview that he had ""no worries"" about the future of the tech.  Overall, he believes that, rather than hostile, the People's Bank of China merely wants to limit investor risk, and that it has no intention of harming or otherwise limiting use of the technology.  Zhao told CoinDesk:  ""It's true that there is some panic selling , but old bitcoiners like me aren't panicking at all. Actually it's a good opportunity to make a profit.""  Zhou Shouji, the operator of FinTech Blockchain Group, a bitcoin hedge fund that claims to have amassed $20m in investments, stressed that, despite the ""high volatility"" in the market, local traders ""are not worried"" about any potential government actions.  ""Everyone gets the message,"" he added.  The statements come as the impact of the decision by the PBoC to make public its meetings with bitcoin exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin has left the bitcoin market in flux. (Yesterday, it hit its lowest point in one month).  At press time, the price of bitcoin was $770, a value that was roughly 40% below peak prices observed earlier this year.  Trading tapers  Yet, while confidence may still be high, some trading firms are reporting changes in customer behavior since the decline began.  Kong Gao, an employee at OTC trading firm Richfund, for example, noted that his firm had seen rapid new customer growth in the run up to the $1,153 price peak. Since then, though, he said this steady growth has declined.  The statements are notable given that OTC trading primarily appeals to larger investors, those who would otherwise influence the bitcoin price on exchanges with large purchases that can cause slippage.  ""A rally like this one does have some impact on OTC volume,"" Kong said. ""Some of them have been anxious, but we have assured them this kind of volatility is not really uncommon in Bitcoinland.""  Kong declined to provide figures to support how much trading had been affected.  CHBTC, an exchange that sees roughly $115,000 in BTC/CNY trading daily, reported that it is still seeing new customers, even if activity is a little depressed.  ""Most traders are holding back to see what happens next,"" a spokesperson for the exchange said.  She added that CHBTC ""welcomes"" the regulation, echoing statements made by BTCC and OKCoin in the wake of last week's news.  Fake volumes  But even after the initial news has subsided, there remains a worry that the government's move could be followed by future enforcement actions.  Zhao Dong noted that there is a perception that Chinese exchanges display ""fake volumes"", a criticism that has long been prevalent in the West, and that has contributed to a notable distrust of these firms.  Zhao, however, stressed that ""not all volumes"" are fake, and that there are ""many speculators and arbitrageurs"" in China that are responsible for contributing to the country's volume. (Figures from CoinDesk Research project 95% of bitcoin trading volumes occur on China-based exchanges).  Harry Yeh, managing partner at US OTC firm Binary Financial, agreed that China's market is ""huge"", or at least larger than many people in the West think.  ""I think people underestimate how big bitcoin is in China. Some of the biggest traders, the biggest miners are all based out of China,"" he said.  However, he acknowledged that findings of fraudulent activity would be ""bad"" for the market.  Others stressed the common refrain among bitcoin's ardent supports that, even if China did move to stop or stem trading, the technology would still proliferate due to the power of the blockchain and its peer-to-peer design.  A representative of China-based exchange Yunbi, for instance, noted that he is ""not worried"" about the impact, despite the fact his exchange was not in conversation with the PBoC.  He concluded:  ""From the standpoint of bitcoin development, this is a very good thing.""

42379176,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nFmL,1484221555,Why I'm Fighting the IRS's Bitcoin Privacy Invasion,"Jeffrey K Berns is a bitcoin user, Coinbase customer and a managing partner at multi-specialty law firm Berns Weiss LLP.  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Berns explains why he chose to seek to intervene in the IRS's attempt to obtain from Coinbase the identities of, and information concerning, millions of US cryptocurrency users.  On 30th November, 2016, a federal court issued an order allowing the IRS to serve an unprecedented summons on Coinbase, Inc, a cryptocurrency exchange, seeking the identities of each of the company's millions of US customers and essentially every piece of information in the company's possession concerning those customers.  As a consumer protection and class action attorney (as well as a cryptocurrency and blockchain entrepreneur), I am deeply concerned about the potential impact that Coinbase's disclosure of this information could have on the burgeoning industry.  I am also troubled by the IRS's motives in issuing this summons.  While I don't want to bore you with the legal procedure that led to the issuance of the summons, the bottom line is that courts grant the IRS substantial leeway to issue a ""John Doe"" summons to a third-party to require it to identify its customers whom the IRS suspects of tax evasion.  Typically, this has occurred when the IRS identifies a practice that has no legitimate purpose, such as improper tax shelters or offshore bank accounts.  In those cases, the IRS has the power to issue summonses to tax shelter promoters and financial institutions to identify likely tax evaders, as there is no other way for the IRS to obtain that information.  In contrast to those circumstances, cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin and ether) have clearly legitimate uses, such that there is no reason to suspect that an individual is engaging in tax avoidance behavior merely because they have chosen to buy or use cryptocurrency.  Indeed, many major online retailers already accept bitcoin, such as Overstock.com, Dell and others.  Speaking up  So, how did I get here?  The IRS's characterization of all cryptocurrency users as potential tax evaders concerned me immediately when I first learned of the summons.  As I have been involved in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community since 2012, I knew that there was no reason to suspect that any meaningful portion of Coinbase's customers were transacting in cryptocurrency to avoid tax obligations.  As I investigated the matter further, I learned that not only was I correct, but that the IRS's actions were even more outrageous than I had originally thought.  Incredibly, the IRS's petition to serve the summons seeking information for millions of Coinbase customers was based primarily on three instances of supposed tax evasion involving bitcoin.  I was so appalled by the flimsy justification for the summons that I determined to investigate the matter further and, as a Coinbase customer, fight the IRS if and when the court granted its petition to serve the summons on Coinbase.  Why me?  My interests in pursuing this action are twofold.  First, I am concerned about the privacy rights of all Coinbase customers, as the IRS is seeking an extraordinary amount of information. This unprecedented demand raises massive security issues concerning the cryptocurrency owned by the customers in view of the government's difficulty in protecting itself from hackers.  Second, I am very worried about the effect this summons could have on the continued expansion and development of blockchain technology in the US.  Google co-founder Larry Page has said, ""Lots of companies don’t succeed over time. What do they fundamentally do wrong? They usually miss the future.""  To the extent that it is taking steps to actively discourage the use of cryptocurrency by US citizens, I strongly believe that the US government is jeopardizing the country’s role in the global economy going forward.  What's next  Cryptocurrency, and the blockchain technology that underlie it, have virtually unlimited potential to change the way that individuals and businesses transact with each other. I believe that this will happen in a way that will greatly benefit consumers through better privacy, reduced transaction costs, enhanced security and faster processing times.  In this way, my stance is about how the government should be fostering this technology, rather than fighting it.  While the IRS is mounting a procedural challenge to prevent the court from considering the issues that I have raised, I pledge to do whatever is necessary to insure that the IRS must explain how it could possibly be entitled to the information that it seeks.  The federal government must not be allowed to trample on the rights of individuals and to stifle innovation due to an undisclosed political agenda.

42427227,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK11lh,1484218093,Bitcoin ATMs Are Being Attacked With Hammers in the US Midwest,"At least three people have been accused of smashing dozens of bitcoin ATMs in the the Midwestern US.  According to court documents filed in the US District Court for the North District of Illinois and obtained by CoinDesk, Andrew Konja, Alvin Konja and Odai Mabroukare are being accused of perpetrating a ""scheme of intimidation and destruction"" aimed to force out competing ATM operators in Detroit and Chicago.  Their goal, the lawsuit alleges, is to put other operators at a disadvantage through extortion and destruction of property.  The plaintiff in the case – SandP Solutions, Inc, which does business as Bitcoin of America – filed suit late last month, and is being represented by attorney William P Suriano of Riverside, Illinois.  The defendants are accused of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.  'Significant expense'  Among the allegations, is that those involved in the scheme attempted to extort other bitcoin ATM operators by requesting digital currency payments in return for protection. The complaint cites one bitcoin ATM operator who paid the demanded sum.  In total, the plaintiff reports that ""approximately 70 bitcoin ATMs"" have been smashed, including ""nearly 20"" operated by Bitcoin of America.  The complaint explains:  ""Plaintiff has had bitcoin ATM machines smashed in both the Chicago and Detroit metropolitan areas. This is most frequently done by an individual using a hammer or other object to smash the screen on a bitcoin ATM, making it unusable for a significant period of time. The screen must then be replaced at significant expense before the smashed bitcoin ATM can be used again.""  The defendants would then go on to offer to repair the broken ATMs owned by affected operators. Further, according to the complaint, the alleged scheme continues to this day.  ""This scheme began approximately nine months ago and is on-going,"" attorneys for the plaintiff wrote.  Andrew Konja, according to the complaint, had run his own ATM business ""which he sold or which was merged into Bitexpress"", a reference to a Philadelphia-based ATM operator.

42427238,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK127h,1484182965,Swift is Building a Blockchain App to Optimize Global Cash Liquidity,"A global platform that connects the vast majority of the world's banks has begun building a blockchain application to simplify cross-border payments.  Announced today, The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is integrating open-source blockchain technology with its own products to build a proof-of-concept that might one day replace the so-called ""nostro"" accounts its members keep filled with cash all over the world – just in case they need it.  If successful, the blockchain application has the potential to finally achieve a longstanding dream of Swift, to free up that cash so it can be invested in more profitable measures.  Speaking with CoinDesk, the company's head of banking markets, Wim Raymaekers, explained what a successful test of distributed ledger technology (DLT) might mean to his clients.  Raymaekers said:  ""We’re going to use DLT as a proof-of-concept to synchronize those databases in real-time, so that banks can optimize their liquidity globally.""  Currently, Swift’s network of 11,000 financial institutions monitor their accounts around the world using the platform's existing debit and credit updates via end-of-day statements.  The maintenance of these accounts accounts for a ""significant portion of the cost of making cross-border payments,"" according to a statement. Exactly how much of that cost could be saved with blockchain, Raymaekers said, was unclear.  ""That’s what we’re looking for in conclusion of this proof of concept,"" he said.  Specifically, Swift hopes to reduce the costs of reconciliation between independent databases maintained by the inter-bank platform's members, reduce operational costs and free up liquidity for other investments.  The experiments appear to be part of a larger exploration of various blockchain solutions.  An earlier blockchain POC designed to test the potential benefits and plausibility of moving the ISO 20022 standard to a blockchain, for example, was built using open-source Monax's codebase.  This most recent blockchain proof-of-concept will leverage the open-source Hyperledger codebase, being developed by a consortium of businesses, of which Swift is a member.  The POC will also consist of a private blockchain for invited members with specific user profiles and ""strong"" data controls. Last year, banking consortium R3CEV and a dozen of its member banks tested Ripple's native asset, XRP, to serve a similar function.  In Swift's case, though, only authorized members will be able to access the POC, which will be integrated with Swift’s own identity management platform and its public key infrastructure (PKI), a security architecture based on cryptographically verified digital signatures.  ""It’s about using technology,"" said Raymaekers. ""But it’s also very important what do you put into the ledger?""  Not waiting for blockchain  Notably, Raymaekers repeatedly emphasized that he believes Swift is already solving its customers’ problems using more traditional, existing technology.  As far back as 2003, Swift had established a working group consisting of several banks that have since taken a leadership role in blockchain to create a decentralized model for bank-to-bank information exchange.  While that early work appears to have been wrapped up in Swift’s Intraday liquidity project to integrate a liquidity dashboard into Swift member databases, the work to improve nostro account management has continued.  In a 2012 report that Raymaekers co-authored, he found that the top 80 payments banks in Swift’s membership had already reduced the number of nostro accounts in Europe and the Americas by 16% and 11% respectively, with accounts in Asia Pacific increasing by 4%, between 2005 and 2011.  Those changes resulting from concerns following the financial collapse of 2007 were part of what Swift described as ""Correspondent Banking 3.0.""  Now, the current blockchain push is part of an even larger effort within Swift called the Global Payments Innovation initiative, or GPI.  Global Payment Innovation  Stepping back further, the GPI itself is part of a series of sweeping changes by Swift designed to simplify cross-border payments around the world.  In its first version, expected to roll out in early 2017 with about 100 banks participating, Swift is working to simplify the process of international payment instructions, the standardized messages for which Swift is perhaps best-known.  According to Raymaekers, that objective has already been largely achieved with traditional technology that the banks can more easily incorporate.  But that’s only half the GPI’s objectives.  The initiative also aims to simplify reconciliation of nostro accounts and more, something Raymaekers believes might prove to be an ideal use case for distributed ledger technology, and something he hopes this most recent proof-of-concept will help prove.  Raymaekers concluded:  ""A big problem is the reconciliation between banks on these supporting databases. That’s where within the GPI initiative, we are going to explore DLT to synchronize those databases.""

42427236,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK121h,1484180018,Lightning Strikes: An (Early) Version of Bitcoin's Big Scaling Solution is Here,"Developers can now test an early version of bitcoin's much-hyped Lightning Network.  Released by one of the most prominent startups working on the open-source micropayments protocol (San Francisco-based Lightning Labs), the daemon runs on the bitcoin testnet, so it's not exactly for average users yet. Rather, the aim is for developers to get their feet wet testing the off-chain transactions, long heralded as one of the best ways to rapidly scale the network, (and it looks like some have already started).  Speaking to CoinDesk today, the Lightning Labs team called the release the “most feature-complete” implementation of the Lightning Network.  Taken together, they said it packages the full requirements of a working off-chain network, including the ability for channels to open and close and for payments to find a path through the network.  Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark told CoinDesk:  ""What our release does is it says to the world, 'Hey, this is a package of features', and it encourages people to contribute.""  Lightning co-founder Joseph Poon, one of the authors of the concept's original white paper, added that the idea is to help prepare developers for Lightning's launch on the live bitcoin blockchain and to ease businesses into integrating it.  Overall, the team seemed eager to give interested developers more guidance.  ""We're hoping that moving forward they'll be able to contribute, but also test, since it's pretty much wide open now,"" developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun said.  He mentioned that Thursday, Lightning Labs will also be releasing a walk-through post along with a “channel faucet"" that will release test coins developers can use to test transactions.  Bitfury, Blockchain Lab, and Chaincode Labs also contributed to the release.  For those who want to find out more, the features in the daemon are those described in the in-progress standards, which outline what features each of the eight or so Lightning projects need to support in order to interoperate.  Right now, developers need to run a bitcoin node to try out the daemon, but a less resource-intensive, Lightning-compatible lite-client is in the works.  Osuntokun mentioned that it will likely be packaged with some other tools, such as a user interface.  Obstacle ahead  All that said, it might not be the milestone the community is looking for right now.  The version is not compatible with the existing bitcoin codebase since it relies on a multi-faceted upgrade known as SegWit, which will make the off-chain channels more secure (as well as enable other long-term benefits like more advanced scripting, as Poon emphasized).  While most in the bitcoin community say the code will be a boost overall, it’s been somewhat controversial, and only about 25% of the necessary 95% of miners have flagged support for the change since November.  “We built this release with the expectation that it will trigger, and I think if you look at past histories of when other soft forks have triggered, sometimes it just took a critical mass. Just because the number is stable right now doesn’t mean we can’t reach critical mass,” Stark said.  She noted that the proposal doesn't expire until 15th November of this year.  Yet, Poon and Osuntokun emphasized that a version of the Lightning Network, although limited and less user friendly, is possible without SegWit.  Poon concluded:  ""We’re ready either way.""
