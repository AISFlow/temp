The patent provides for a system that could let people holding different asset types transact in real time: &apos;The present technology permits a first party to pay in any currency, while permitting the second party to be paid in any currency,&apos; according to the application. That could smooth the use of currencies like bitcoin (BTC-USD) for retail use - an application where few merchants can take payment methods that take too long to process amid wildly swinging values. The patent suggests the system could be extended to add support for asset classes including securities, derivatives or loans, Coindesk notes.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3533753-square-wins-patent-for-crypto-to-fiat-processing-report?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/seekingalpha/d80a00w8822.png

42431449,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2XLh,1579728566,Federal Judge Orders Kik Technical Advisor to Sit for Deposition With SEC,"Kik technical advisor Tanner Philp must be deposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to the company's 2017 kin token sale, elongating the discovery process in the messaging app’s battle with federal regulators.      The agreement was made Wednesday before District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein in the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York. Overseeing the latest motion for discovery in this $100 million ICO standoff, Judge Hellerstein initially ruled that Kik CEO Ted Livingston should appear for a deposition, but attorneys for both sides appeared to come to an agreement to have Philp appear instead.      Judge Hellerstein said the deposition should focus on the nature of Kik Interactive's business from 2018 to the present.      According to court documents, Philp already provided testimony in August 2018.      The SEC wants Kik to provide more testimony, documents and details on its business and plans surrounding the kin token offering. The regulator alleged Kik violated federal securities laws last year during the kin sale, suing the messaging platform in federal court in June.      It originally filed a sweeping motion for discovery on Oct. 25, but amended that notice with a pared-down motion on Dec 8.      Such documents could shed light on Kik’s thinking in the run-up to its initial coin offering, including its executives’ thoughts on the digital asset offering report issued by the SEC in 2017.      Kik disputed the SEC’s request in past filings, saying the provided written answers made further testimony redundant.      Kik had asked Judge Hellerstein to nix further depositions. In a joint letter on Jan. 14, Kik’s legal team argued the SEC had already taken hours of testimony from senior management - including Livingston - and collected thousands of documents in the regulator’s multi-year investigation. It called for a protective order that would have restricted the discovery process.      It said the SEC’s latest deposition notices were over-broad and under-detailed. Kik said the SEC did not adequately explain its need for further testimony, citing the deposition rule, Rule 30(b)(6), and saying the rule requires deposition notices explain their investigatory intent with “painstaking specificity.”      The SEC rejected those claims in its portion of the joint letter. It argued its deposition notices do indeed seek “relevant” information and further quibbled with Kik’s interpretation of rule 30(b)(6), which it pointed out reads “reasonable particularity,” not “painstaking specificity.”      Read Judge Hellerstein's full order below:      UPDATE (Jan. 23, 22:35 UTC): This article has been updated to include the formal order written by Judge Hellerstein.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/22/federal-judge-orders-kik-technical-advisor-to-sit-for-deposition-with-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3a0ff6795414960aa37af719c97b0d060d18d8e-2039x1530.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431445,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2XJh,1579722005,SEC Depositions Shed Light on Telegram's $1.7B Token Sale,"Telegram CEO Pavel Durov pushed back against a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) attorney’s speculation that his company’s 2018 token sale was meant to refill its cash reserves.      During an 18-hour deposition, Durov disputed in particular SEC attorney Jorge Tenreiro's claim that the sale would help Telegram pay for servers. This claim is a core part of the SEC’s argument in the ongoing case that Telegram was selling unregistered securities.      Acсording to Durov, from the beginning he has been funding Telegram with proceeds from the sale of his earlier creation, popular Russian social network Vkontakte, or VK.com.      “Typically, I wouldn't separate my personal savings from the needs of Telegram Messenger,” Durov said, according to a transcript of the Jan. 7-8 deposition. “If I see that Telegram needs more resources, I would happily invest more because I'm a person that prefers not to own any real estate.”      The newly released transcripts of the SEC’s depositions of Durov, Telegram Vice President Ilia Perekopsky and financial services specialist Shyam Parekh offer a rare window into the logic and the mechanics behind the $1.7 billiontoken sale.      Rather than fundraising for the company, selling the tokens known as grams to investors was a way to make sure enough of them are staked to secure the proof-of stake TON blockchain, Durov claimed.      “And only after that, realizing that we now have access to certain funds and at the same time we are limited in our ability to pursue alternative potential revenue streams, due to the fact that we are busy building TON Blockchain, we decided that we could use some of the funds for some of the purposes that I described,” he said, referencing the expenses of the Telegram messaging app.      Asked why Telegram didn’t opt for equity fundraising, which Durov contemplated at some point before the token sale, he said: “Because we were concerned that selling equity could affect the company's integrity and its values, and change the company's ethos and what it stands for.”    Vital signs      The SEC sued Telegram in October, accusing the company of selling unregistered securities and ordering it to halt the launch of TON. The first hearing for the case is scheduled Feb. 18 in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District Of New York. Earlier this week, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and the Blockchain Association filed friend-of-the-court briefs to the court in support of Telegram.      According to Durov’s deposition, Telegram has reached about 300 million monthly active users, with the large user base acting as TON’s main selling point at the time of the billion token sale.      However, as the court process with the SEC approaches the first hearing in February, Telegram recently announced that a wallet app for the future gram tokens will not be built into the messaging app at the time of the launch. It didn’t rule out, however, that the wallet will be a part of the messenger at some point in the future.      Between 25 and 30 employees are working on the startup’s core team, juggling between coding for TON and supporting the messenger app, Durov said.      Another part of the SEC’s argument is that investors in TON only bought grams to sell them for profit, as they would do with normal securities, and not to use them on the TON blockchain, for example, to stake them and become validators of the proof-of stake network.      Telegram did not make efforts to make sure investors in the token sale would be the blockchain’s validators as well, but there was interest from a number of investors in doing so, Durov said.      “I think we received interest from – well, at least several validators – potential validators, it may be a dozen, and we were actively, you know, processing such inquiries and requests for validation in early October when this process was interrupted by this started litigation,” he said.      Perekopsky also said that many investors had been asking about validation. “Especially the closer to the launch we got, the more questions were about that, and they were sending emails asking in Telegram, calling, asking in meetings,” he said.    Investor gatekeeping    The SEC also argues Telegram failed to report its fundraising properly as while the company filed for an exemption from registration under Regulation D in February and March 2018, funds kept coming Telegram’s way after the filings’ dates.      Durov, Perekopsky and Parekh said in their depositions that a significant part of the $1.7 billion came after the sale rounds were officially over, but explained the purchase agreements for all those funds had been already signed at the time of filing and it just took some investors more time to wire the funds.      According to Parekh, both the first and second round of the token sale was oversubscribed, especially the first, February 2018 pre-sale round when the number of interested investors exceeded the $850 target sum three to four times.      It was Durov, Perekopsky and Telegram’s head of international, John Hyman, who decided who to let in, Perekopsky and Parekh said.      The criteria were investors’ reputation and where they come from, Perekopsky explained. ""We tried to diversify investors by geography, so we didn't want one particular region of the world like to dominate in our list of investors.”      The same thinking was behind choosing the first crypto exchanges Telegram contacted about listing grams: According to Perekopsky, he personally reached out to Binance, Coinbase and OKex.      ""As far as I know, Coinbase was more focused on [the] United States. Binance is a global player in many countries. OKex is more focused on Asia,"" Perekopsky explained.    Fake investors?    Telegram’s executives also explicitly denied in their depositions a company called Gram Asia invested in TON, apparently contradicting Gram Asia's claim that it was “the largest holder of grams” on the continent.      That claim appeared to be supported this past summer when Japan-based exchange Liquid offered to sell future grams to its users for $4 each (compared to $0.37 and $1.33 in the 2018 primary offerings), saying it had partnered with Gram Asia on the “exclusive sale.”      The entity is mentioned in the deposition multiple times as the SEC alleged Telegram was helping the secondary market of grams thrive, which, in the agency’s reasoning, supported the idea that grams were securities.      Last week, Liquid canceled the sale, saying that as TON did not launch by an Oct. 31, 2019 deadline, the tokens would not be delivered and that it had refunded buyers. The exchange would not say whether Gram Asia had anything to do with the decision.      Asked if Gram Asia was a TON investor during his deposition, Durov said: “I don't think we have Gram Asia as a party in any of the agreements we may have entered into.”      Regarding the sale on Liquid Perekopsky, who was in charge of working with investors, told the SEC: “Gram Asia was not our investor, so it was not clear what we can do in this situation.”      According to other court documents, in a message exchange in July 2019, Durov and Perekopsky discussed the announcement of the token sale on Liquid and how to react to it. “Who is this Kim guy and why is he telling TC that we gave him our approval for that?” Durov asked, referring to Gram Asia’s CEO, Dongbeom Kim.      “Assholes, those Liquid people,” Durov wrote. “Using the info vacuum for self-promotion. And this Kim guy, too.”",NEUTRAL,TON,ASIA | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TON | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/22/sec-depositions-shed-light-on-telegrams-17b-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb459a56c3fabd509e9f94bcac2cf901814116f4-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday, the asset manager will continue to donate one-third of the management fees from its Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust to the ETC Cooperative each quarter through 2021.      “It is a big vote of confidence which we deeply appreciate. This funding allows us to continue our support of the ETC protocol and ecosystem,” ETC Cooperative executive director Bob Summerwill said by private message. “We will provide grants for key projects, as we have through 2018 and 2019.""      Since 2017, Grayscale has donated a total of $1.1 million, including $338,000 in 2019, to the cooperative, which funds development of the protocol behind the 15th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.    Grayscale manages some $80 million of assets in its ethereum classic vehiclehttps://grayscale.co/ethereum-classic-trust/, with nearly 10 million shares backed by about 0.92 ETC each. The trust controls about 14 percent of the total supply of ETC, based on fund disclosures and data from ETC Block Explorer. The manager charges a fee of three percent of assets under management.    The company is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk.      Ethereum classic was created in 2016 as a splinter currency from ethereum (ETH) after the team leading development for the latter made a controversial decision to roll back a hacker’s transactions.      More recently, however, ETC has been building bridges with its sister chain. Recent hard forks, or system-wide upgrades, in September 2019 and January 2020 added ethereum-based updates to ethereum classic for improved interoperability.      The ethereum classic team expects to achieve “protocol parity with ETH” from a pending hard fork known as Aztlán, Summerwill said.

The torch is a digital game first ignited in January 2019 by pseudonymous bitcoin enthusiast Hodlonaut, known for his Twitter avatar of a cat in a spacesuit. Each ""torchbearer"" sends a tiny amount of bitcoin to the next. A key rule is to add a little bit more money to the payment each time it moves to someone new.      The goal is to highlight the speed and global nature of the lightning network, a payment technology that could solve or at least greatly ease some of bitcoin's most critical problems. Started on a whim for fun, the torch became a global event, even carried by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, showing how frictionless and indifferent to borders the form of payment is compared to legacy methods like Visa and Paypal.      On Sunday, Hodlonaut lit the torch for the second time, in what he described as a ""spur-of-the-moment decision."" Since then, many enthusiasts have been posting lightning ""invoices"" on Twitter to which the torchbearer can send the next lightning payment.      It's moving around the world much faster the second time around, already reaching 91 people in three days.      ""Made over 30 passes across the globe as I slept!"" Hodlonaut said on Twitter Tuesday morning.      Speaking to CoinDesk, Hodlonaut argued that one reason the torch has changed hands so speedily this time is that the big names and companies haven't taken it.      ""It has been almost exclusively held by 'plebs,'"" he said. ""There has been no posturing, just lots of enthusiastic, normal bitcoin and [lightning network] users that have passed the torch along promptly, with no fuss. It feels very grassroots.""      Last time, it took longer than two weeks to get to 139 people in 37 countries. But the torch made some exciting stops on that tour. Despite worries about breaking U.S. sanctions, the torch made it to Iran last March. A group of Venezuelans received the torch with no electricity. In an interesting experiment, they powered their lightning node with a motorcycle battery.      The first torch fizzled out when it reached a hard-coded limit on how much lightning can be sent in a single payment. The cap is 4.29 million satoshis, the unit for one hundred millionth of a bitcoin. Developers could lift the cap (which works out to about $370 at current exchange rates) when they think the payment technology is secure enough.      Until then, Hodlonaut is eager to see how long the new torch lasts.

42431429,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2Wph,1579708800,Jack Dorsey's Square Wins Patent for Fiat-to-Crypto Payments Network,"Payments provider Square has won a U.S. patent for a new network that enables seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions.      Granted Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the patent details a payments system allowing users holding different asset types to transact with one another in real-time.      ""The present technology permits a first party to pay in any currency, while permitting the second party to be paid in any currency,"" reads Square's application. The network itself can automatically exchange the sender's payment into the asset specified by the receiver.      This new system could be especially advantageous for the retail sector, according to the filing. Many cryptocurrencies are too volatile and too slow to become an effective payments solution. Few merchants can feasibly accept a payments method that takes hours to process when the value may swing wildly.      But Square thinks it can ""remove barriers"" with a system that features automatic exchange and real-time settlements. Consumers can pay in their preferred asset – using a privacy coin to keep their identities secret, for example – and merchants receive the full value in an asset they want to hold.      The patent suggests the system could be extended to add support for other asset classes including securities, derivatives or loans.      Square integrated bitcoin in 2018 and Dorsey has said multiple times he believes BTC could become the ""native currency"" for the internet. Square has generally been reticent on other cryptocurrencies. Asked if the firm planned to add support for other digital coins, the head of the cryptocurrency team said last summer the team remained focused on bitcoin and would continue supporting its network development and mass adoption.      Square also announced in a blog post Tuesday it would be releasing a ""Lightning Development Kit"", enabling wallet and app developers to create layer-2 solutions on top of the bitcoin protocol.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/22/jack-dorseys-square-wins-patent-for-fiat-to-crypto-payments-network,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42431450,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2XPh,1579707169,Retail Accumulation? Number of Bitcoin Addresses With One or More Coins Sees Solid Rise,"A key on-chain metric has witnessed growth over the past 12 months, possibly indicating steady accumulation of bitcoins by retail traders.       As of Jan. 14, there were 784,000 addresses holding one or more bitcoins, up nearly 11 percent from 707,000 seen a year ago, according to blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. The number has more than doubled since early 2015.      ""The steady rise is the result of accumulation by retail buyers,"" according to Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data in Denver.       Address growth can also come from exchanges and big players, known as “whales,” though such addresses usually hold large balances and often rank at the top of bitcoin’s ""rich list,” a table of the addresses holding the most bitcoins.       For instance, three of the top five addresses on the rich list, published by bitinfocharts.com, belong to prominent exchanges Huobi, Bitfinex and Binance. Topping that list is Huobi's cold wallet, currently holding 255,502 BTC.      Meanwhile, the number of addresses with balances between 0.1 BTC and 1 BTC have also risen by 10 percent year over year. These small balances, however, are may be residuals from large transactions or holdings of one time users.     Adoption as a store of value    ""The rising number of addresses accumulating greater amounts of BTC is a sign that adoption as a store of value is increasing,"" said Connor Abendschein, analyst at Digital Assets Data.       Retail accumulation, as represented by the growth in the number of addresses with one or more coins, has remained solid over the years despite price gyrations.       Bitcoin prices rose from $3,600 to $13,880 in the first six months of 2019 before falling to $6,430 in December. Even so, the number of addresses with one or more bitcoins rose by 77,000 in 12 months.       This type of investor behavior is seen in the gold market. The yellow metal, a classic safe haven asset with a strong store of value appeal, generally finds takers across the globe regardless of the short-term price trends.       Yet, many observers, including the likes of billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, are of the opinion that bitcoin is simply too volatile to become a proper alternative as a store of value.     Wealth distribution    ""Address balances are a good proxy for potential unique users,” Yassine Elmandjra, crypto asset analyst at ARK Invest, told CoinDesk. “The growth in unique BTC addresses suggests a continued increase in BTC’s wealth distribution.”       The market, however, is still dominated by whales. As of December, investors with 1,000 to 1 million bitcoins held 42.1 percent of the total supply compared to 37.9 percent seen during the bull market frenzy of late 2017.       Also, the rise in the number of unique addresses does not necessarily mean an influx of new investors into the market. After all, a single investor can hold 1,000 BTC in 1,000 addresses or more, so the metric has its limits. Thus the rise in the number of addresses with a balance of one or more bitcoins does not necessarily imply increased participation in the market.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/22/retail-accumulation-number-of-bitcoin-addresses-with-one-or-more-coins-sees-solid-rise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f80a296d4a068af6bea8017437f8617512dbda77-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Annotations on Hacker Noon’s blog-styled content, with some four million monthly readers, will now be locally hosted on users' spare storage space, said Hacker Noon CEO David Smooke in a press release. These annotations and in-line comments will be powered by ERA Inc.’s GUN, a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) database system.      By utilizing local storage on Hacker Noon reader’s free CPU space, the cost of maintaining the domain drops on GUN specifically, ERA CEO Mark Nadal said in a phone interview. Both firms are working towards further blockchain feature integrations in the near future as well but declined to comment on what this included.      Nadal said the annotations and in-line comments themselves will be hosted on readers' devices using GUN. Annotations will only appear if approved by the contributing author.      “Blockchain technology can distribute the hosting cost of running a site like ours, where people spend over 25 million minutes reading each month,” Smooke said.      The system was first tested in July 2019 and proved blockchain systems can be used both quickly and at scale as the system serviced readers successfully for 48 hours, Nadal said.      Launched in 2016 by Smooke and business partner Jay Zalowitz along with wife Linh Dao Smooke, Hacker Noon announced its intentions to leave Medium last spring, citing general sentiment around publishers getting “burnt” by the platform and saying they lacked general control over content such as headlines, advertisements and URL reroutes.      In a March 2019 podcast, Smooke said Medium offered to buy out Hacker Noon for a low sum, less than a Medium marketing professional makes in a year. Hacker Noon chose to run a crowdfunding campaign instead, ultimately raising $1.07 million from 1,200 people.

42431485,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2XHh,1579701605,Notes From the WEF: The Coming Battle Between Surveilled and Private Money,"DAVOS, Switzerland — When the world’s leading bankers and policymakers gathered this week at the 50th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, their interest in blockchain technology was resoundingly clear.      “The number one use case of blockchain technology promoted by the government is data sharing,” Zhang Jiachen, CEO of the startup Guangzhishu Technology, said on the sidelines of the WEF. Jiachen said her firm works with several Chinese government agencies.      Representatives from some nations are watching the People’s Bank of China's (PBoC) central bank digital currency (CBDC) experiment with eager anticipation. Neha Narula, director of MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, described the dozens of central bank experiments with digital assets in 2020 as “inevitable.” Along those lines, the WEF published a Central Bank Digital Currency Policy-Maker Toolkit Wednesday to help those projects access global standards if they choose.      “The Bank of Thailand has made good progress on a wholesale CBDC project, called Project Inthanon,” Veerathai Santiprabhob, governor of Bank of Thailand, said in a press statement. “From our experience, we need to identify tradeoffs between benefits from the use cases and their associated risks across different dimensions.”      In turn, Jiachen said Chinese technologists are drawing inspiration from the Facebook-initiated Libra project and ethereum, although she declined to say what types of initiatives are inspired by the latter.      “Can we join a consortium of countries who would like to use a regional digital currency where the PBoC is part of it?” she said in an interview. “There’s a lot of strategic thinking around whether that’s a real option.”    Multiple efforts    Most experts at Davos appear to agree blockchain technology should be used for more data collection, not self-sovereign finance.      For example, Ibrahima Guimba-Saidou, technology advisor to the president of Niger, said it will be crucial for emerging economies to use digital reporting systems to avoid embezzlement and other financial crimes.      “My goal is to have a paperless government by 2028,” he said on the sidelines of the WEF. “How could any leader or government official take that money without being noticed? Cryptocurrency brings that; through the blockchain you know where things are.”      As with China, Guimba-Saidou said his country is curious about the idea of a regional token.      It may be too soon to say whether bitcoin will be used by African nations, he added, but 15 nations in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are in talks about launching a pan-African currency comparable to the euro.      Matthew Blake, the WEF’s monetary systems lead, said a digital, regional currency in Africa makes a lot of sense, although the euro has proved that cooperative currency governance is tricky at best.      While he expressed interest in watching how bitcoin evolves, Blake was skeptical, at best, of nation-states using bitcoin or allowing enterprises to use bitcoin on a significant scale. Mikail Jabbarov, economic minister of the Azerbaijan Republic, likewise told CoinDesk he struggled to imagine nation-states condoning the use of a decentralized currency.      While he didn’t suggest it should be banned outright, Jabbarov’s primary concern was collecting know-your-customer (KYC) information associated with bitcoin ownership. He was otherwise dismissive of the cryptocurrency’s potential for use cases beyond speculation and illicit activities.      At least, in Guimba-Saidou’s case, the focus is on monitoring public servants’ monetary transactions rather than all civilians. Along those lines, to safeguard who can access civilian monetary records and even passive surveillance of broader patterns, the PBoC recently filed a patent for a blockchain-based system for authorizing access to data.      “We’re going to have a public key infrastructure,” Niger’s Guimba-Saidou said. “That’s how I think we can have the transparency and traceability in place and the accountability that comes from it. All those things have to be done with independent organizations because otherwise one organization could try to grab the information or alter it.”    Real names    There’s widespread concern about bitcoin wallets that essentially allow “secret bank accounts,” according to Daria Kaleniuk, co-founder of Ukraine’s Anti-Corruption Action Center.      In an interview, she said Russia isn’t the only nation with a state-owned nuclear power plant that is also supporting bitcoin mining operations. This trend is also spreading to Ukraine and Moldova, she said, with Ukrainian oligarchs taking dominant roles in the local bitcoin market.      “When we see a politician declaring bitcoin, we consider him ‘high risk,’” Kaleniuk said. “This money can buy propaganda campaigns. … There needs to be unique identities of natural persons in this data.”      Some of these central bank projects go beyond mere identity checks. In China, there are already efforts to use government data, everything from healthcare data to telecommunications records, to shape financial services offered by the private sector.      “The government owns a lot of data,” Jiachen said. “They want to enable the private sector to be able to use them but they don’t want to hand over the data ownership. So we help the government in supporting their data-sharing initiatives.”      Most raw data isn’t recorded on the blockchain, she said. Instead, blockchain technology is used to prove the records were verified or calculated at the source, without sharing the original source. Jiachen said she hopes there will be strict policies that regulate who can request and access such data. MIT’s Nerula mirrored this concern.      “I hope privacy is a central concern and that it’s implemented with the Application Program Interface [API] in mind,” Nerula said.    Bigger government    Even private investors from a variety of countries, who asked not to be named, were curious about central bank experiments but wary of self-custodied assets.      Those who are optimistic about digital assets in Davos see them as a way to improve governance rather than reduce reliance on it.      “It’s easier to track the whole monetary flows and then you can make better monetary policies,” Jiachen said. “Now with a blockchain-based system, you will have a better feedback loop.”      She said many blockchain efforts, beyond the PBoC currency yet also adjacent to it, are targeting cross-border trade.      Meanwhile, economist and ethereum community guru Glen Weyl is busy taking meetings with politicians from emerging economies. He said he’s not a fan of China’s Communist approach but he hopes China’s collective and civic mentality can be leveraged to help pioneer value systems beyond traditional assets.      “Eventually we need to have less money and have forms of value that are more socially contextualized, like weighted edges on a graph that represent favors owed,” Weyl said in an interview. “China has social credit, so in some ways they are much more attuned to the social aspect"" of money.      In order to avoid dystopian consequences, Weyl is working with organizations like the World Bank to develop the Data Freedom Act, which asserts data collectors have a “fiduciary responsibility and democratic responsibility” to both protect it and not flagrantly use data without consent. The document is based on providing a framework for “collective bargaining,” Weyl said, to give civilians more power to challenge problematic situations than they would have as individuals.      Speaking more broadly about CBDC experiments, WEF executive committee member Blake said the organization wants to ""lean in"" and ""be active"" there.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/22/notes-from-the-wef-the-coming-battle-between-surveilled-and-private-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae4ff6eb1b93adbe84527f2b0092912c97667c9b-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The enterprise blockchain consortium launched the Hyperledger Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group (SIG) during the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting. Said to be the first of its kind, the Climate SIG will enable participants to share ideas and findings on how distributed ledgers can help governments and companies coordinate on reducing global emissions.      ""DLTs are central to the creation of a global and open climate accounting system that helps integrate all actors and actions under the same planetary goal,"" according to Hyperledger's website.      The technology may become a transparent global database to track emissions, identify problem areas and coordinate solutions, helping the world meet the Paris Agreement's goal for preventing increases in global average temperatures rising 2°C above the pre-industrial average.      Group participants will consider how Hyperledger's blockchain can become an open climate project. Members will develop the mechanisms required to enable trustless emissions and climate statistics reporting, and will create the protocols and standards suitable for companies and governments around the world.      ""Innovation and the real-world impact of enterprise blockchain are top of mind for us"", said Hyperledger's executive director, Brian Behlendorf. Initiatives like Climate SIG, he added, will improve understanding for the technology's use cases and broader potential.      Hyperledger also welcomed six new members to its enterprise consortium, including the digital business consulting firm Cognizant and the University of Hong Kong.      ""By joining the Linux Foundation and Hyperledger, Cognizant will be working with several notable organizations to advance the Blockchain and DLT ecosystems for users around the globe,"" said Lata Varghese, Cognizant's vice president for blockchain and DLT.

42431437,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2X7h,1579695433,"Blockchain Association Sides With Telegram Against SEC, Says Grams Are Not Securities","The Blockchain Association, a U.S. advocacy group uniting the industry’s leading startups including Coinbase, Circle, 0x, Ripple and others, has filed an amicus curiae brief in the ongoing SEC vs. Telegram case.      It’s the second industry’s motion in as many days to support Telegram's fight against the SEC allegation it violated U.S. securities law by selling future tokens (called grams) for its TON blockchain to accredited investors in the U.S.      On Tuesday, the Chamber of Digital Commerce filed its own amicus brief, supporting Telegram’s argument that “digital assets may be the subject of an investment contract without being a security.” The Chamber, however, did not explicitly ask the court to take either side in this litigation.      The Blockchain Association’s brief strikes a more straightforward note, arguing Telegram made sufficient efforts to meet the SEC's criteria, adding that the regulator's court action could harm both Telegram’s investors and the market in general.      “The Court should not block a long-planned, highly anticipated product launch by interfering with a contract between sophisticated private parties. Doing so would needlessly harm the investors that securities laws were designed to protect,” the association says in its brief.      Repeating long-held concerns that blockchain and cryptocurrency companies have not received clear and unambiguous guidance from the SEC for years, the brief argues the agency's litigation against Telegram makes the situation even more gray:    “The SEC’s lawsuit also raises novel questions regarding whether companies are forbidden from raising funds from sophisticated U.S. investors, under well-established regulatory provisions, to build blockchain networks.”    The advocacy group cites other cases of blockchain startups successfully interacting with the regulator, namely TurnKey Jet and Pocketful of Quarters, which both secured no-action letters from the SEC. Kik is also mentioned, a firm still hoping for a court trial on its famous case.      “Engaging with the SEC is extremely costly” and doesn’t necessarily save companies from future actions, the brief argues.      “Telegram discussed its plans with SEC staff for a year and a half, provided copious information and responded to limited feedback by adjusting the design of its transaction. Yet, at the end, the SEC has sued, and the SEC’s briefs thus far say nothing about the substance of those discussions,” the association says.      Forcing Telegram to cancel the launch of TON and the token issuance will ultimately harm both innovators and investors who invested in grams, the brief continues: “It would frustrate the investors’ aims in entering into the Purchase Agreement, and would frustrate innovation by delaying the network launch.”      The association concludes by asking the court to “reject the SEC’s arguments that the not-yet-in-existence Grams were securities at the time of the Purchase Agreements.”      The first court hearing for the case is scheduled for February 18.",POSITIVE,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | ZRX | TON,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/22/blockchain-association-sides-with-telegram-against-sec-says-grams-are-not-securities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e3d20273094a2cda3e463ebeeea5ceadd9166f6-1500x971.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a complaint filed on Tuesday, the SEC alleges that, from September 2017 to October 2018, Opporty International, Inc. and its founder and sole owner Sergii Grybniak conducted a ""fraudulent"" sale of digital assets called OPP Tokens, raising around $600,000 from roughly 200 investors in the U.S. and elsewhere.      However, the defendants did not register the tokens with the regulator, which alleges the initial coin offering constituted a securities offering.      Further, the SEC states Grybniak and his company misled investors over the sale, ""making material misrepresentations and omissions to investors and engaging in other deceptive conduct during the offering.""      For example, Oppty is alleged to have falsely touted the platform as already having as many as over 6,000 ""verified providers"" ready to use the platform. ""In fact, the overwhelming majority of these purported 'verified providers' had expressed no such willingness and were not contributing content to Opporty's platform,"" according to the complaint.      Opporty also allegedly claimed to have 17 million small U.S. businesses in its catalog, suggesting to investors that all these firms were genuine businesses eligible to do business on the platform. However, the SEC states, the firm had merely bought a database of entity and individual profiles. This was not disclosed to investors in the token, alleges the complaint.      Had the firm registered the sale with the SEC, it would have meant investors could have been provided ""sufficient, accurate information relating to the ICO,"" the regulator says.      Oppty's tokens were sold via purchase agreements called ""simple agreements for future tokens"" (SAFTs) – a framework once touted as being a way to avoid such regulatory actions. As such, they ""constituted investment contracts and, thus, securities,"" the SEC says.      The complaint indicates the SEC seeks to have the defendants return the ""ill-gotten gains"" from the ICO, refrain from future issuances of securities and pay civil penalties.

42431452,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2XRh,1579688962,Bitcoin Bulls Seek Stronger Move After Bounce to $8.8K Loses Momentum,"View    Bitcoin needs to see a sustained move above $8,750 to confirm an end of the price pullback from Sunday's high near $9,200.  A strong move past that level will likely fuel a re-test of $9,200. That looks likely, with the longer duration charts flashing bullish signals.  A break below key support near $8,460 would open the door for a drop back to $8,200-$8,000.    Bitcoin's bounce from key price support is struggling to gather traction.      The top cryptocurrency by market value made a reversal from levels near $8,461 (Sunday's low) during Tuesday's U.S. trading hours, rising to a high of $8,793 earlier today, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The bulls have defended the $8,460 level multiple times since late on Sunday. Tuesday's bounce was the third successful defense of the former resistance-turned-support of the last 72 hours (bitcoin had dropped back at the same level on Jan. 8).      This morning's spike to $8,793 in the Asian trading hours was short-lived, and the cryptocurrency is currently trading near $8,630. Similar price action has been seen in the last 48 hours.      Essentially, bitcoin is generally trapped in the $8,460-$8,750 trading range and only a sustained break above $8,750 would imply bull revival.    Hourly chart    The range-bound trading is taking place following a convincing downside breach of the ascending trendline over the weekend.      An hourly close below $8,461 would confirm range breakdown and signal a continuation of the pullback from $9,188, opening the door to support at $8,200 (horizontal line) and possibly to $8,000.      On the other hand, an hourly close above $8,750 would confirm an end of the pullback and could fuel a rise to recent highs near $9,200.      An upwards move looks the more likely path ahead, as the longer duration charts are reporting bullish conditions.    Daily and 4-hour charts    Bitcoin created a bullish outside-day candle on Tuesday, which occurs when prices close the day on a positive note, engulfing preceding day's trading range. The candle is widely considered as an early warning of an impending bullish move.      Further, the higher lows on the 4-hour chart's MACD are signaling a weakening of bearish momentum.      The weekly chart, too, is indicating the path of least resistance is to the higher side.

42383223,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uZtJ,1579687200,Digital Chamber Asks Court to Draw Line Between Investment Contracts and Assets in Telegram Case,"The Chamber of Digital Commerce, a blockchain advocacy group, wants a U.S. court to distinguish between an investment contract and the underlying asset used by Telegram during a 2018 initial coin offering (ICO).      The Digital Chamber submitted an amicus curiae brief – a filing made by someone who is not a party in the litigation – in Telegram’s ongoing fight in court with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleged the messenger platform violated securities law during its $1.7 billion ICO. The chamber urges the SEC to draw a clear line between investment contracts in general, which are treated as a security under federal law, and digital assets.      ""Without a clear legal distinction between a transaction determined to be an investment contract and the digital asset that is the subject of the investment contract, these software developers, retailers, healthcare providers, advertising companies, and others may not be able to develop or use blockchain technology without unintentionally triggering the U.S. federal securities laws every time a digital asset is used as part of their network,"" the brief says.      The chamber does not have a view on whether the sale of grams, Telegram's token, is a securities transaction, it added. Rather, the group's interest is ""in ensuring that the legal framework applied to digital assets underlying an investment contract is clear and consistent.""      Telegram is scheduled to meet the SEC in court on Feb. 18 and 19 to discuss whether grams are securities.      The brief was written by Lilya Tessler, the New York head of the FinTech and Blockchain group at Sidley Austin law firm.      The argument echoes Telegram's own response to the SEC's allegations, which insists that while the purchase agreements for the tokens were securities, grams themselves, once issued, will be utility tokens to be used in its new proof-of-stake blockchain.      “In Howey, specific orange groves sold pursuant to an investment contract were not themselves securities. On the premise that a digital asset that is the subject of an investment contract is not necessarily a security itself, the asset (a commodity) may simply be the subject of an ordinary commercial transaction,” the brief says, referencing the famous Supreme Court case often used to determine whether an investment is a security.      The brief warns that deeming any digital assets securities for the sole reason of being recorded digitally could mean “the companies operating these systems may need to become registered broker-dealers or another type of regulated financial institution or worse, subject to severe enforcement action.”      This, in turn, can push innovative businesses out of the U.S., the brief said.      “Like so many other types of assets (which will often be commodities), digital assets may be the subject of an investment contract without being a security,” the brief says, hinting that grams might not be unregistered securities, as the SEC believes, but a digital commodity.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/22/digital-chamber-asks-court-to-draw-line-between-investment-contracts-and-assets-in-telegram-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b6ff1eb8745f8fc1188c830dbba89481f7a3e36-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced in a blog post on Wednesday, Gin Chao, strategy officer at Malta-based Binance, said Numbers' protocol will bring developers ""easy access"" to the exchange's own blockchain – Binance Chain – and could be used features like hardware wallet security, digital signatures and more.      Numbers has developed a protocol that it says makes data ""open, transparent and traceable,"" with use cases in digital identities or supply chain traceability. The company has also built an open-source mobile app that ""fingerprints"" data with information such as location, time and more, meaning the data is verifiable and can, for example, be used by content creators for monetization.      The Taiwanese firm is said to have been working with the Shoah Foundation, Stanford University and IBM on data traceability. It's also worked on verification systems for HTC's EXODUS blockchain phone.      Numbers' product ""is integrated with Binance Chain through Zion, a hardware-based key management system,"" Chao said. The HTC phone comes equipped with a similar feature called Zion Vault. HTC has previously said it would support Binance's blockchain with a special edition version of the cellphone.      Numbers co-CEO Bofu Chen said the cash injection from Binance would be used to explore more use cases for its products and speed up technological and business development.

42383230,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uaAv,1579656915,Swiss Banks Enter the Age of Bitcoin,"DAVOS, Switzerland — Switzerland’s banking industry has long been known to privately safeguard wealth, so some bankers see bitcoin as a natural fit for the nation’s financial sector.      Although such bankers may still be a minority, Zurich-based SEBA Bank AG opened in November 2019 with a universal banking license and a suite of services ranging from fiat storage to crypto custody, a crypto-connected debit card that automatically converts to fiat on the backend for regular shopping and crypto-trading options through the bank’s mobile app.      SEBA CEO Guido Bühler said the bank raised 100 million Swiss francs (roughly $103.4 million) from angel investors including Guy Schwarzenbach, founder of Black River Asset Management.      Schwarzenbach said the pricing for SEBA app trades, enabled by backend API integrations with global exchanges, offered “extremely competitive” pricing compared to over-the-counter trades.      “What I am really excited about for SEBA … is their upcoming deployment of a margin and lending business, including options and derivatives,” Schwarzenbach said.      SEBA was hardly the first bitcoin-friendly Swiss bank. The private bank Falcon Group, for example, launched bitcoin management services in 2017. Matthew Blake, the World Economic Forum's monetary systems lead, described crypto-friendly, fully licensed banks as an emerging trend.      ""It's something institutions can do to hedge,"" he said.      Likewise, the Swiss crypto startup Bitcoin Suisse has also applied for a universal banking license with the goal of offering everything from staking services to loans.      “We're not applying for a banking license just to be like every other bank. We are pioneers at heart,” Niklas Nikolajsen, founder and chairman of Bitcoin Suisse, said via spokesperson. “We will, of course, offer cash accounts for our clients, in their own name. ... We will be able to start trading crypto securities, stablecoins and synthetics, such as mini-futures and products to short the major crypto assets.”    Crypto bank    However, among such banks so far, SEBA offers a unique ability to hold a variety of many fiat currencies, including American dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Singaporean dollars, then instantly trade cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether and Stellar lumens.      “You can open an account over the phone in 15 minutes for an accredited investor, you don’t have to go to Switzerland,” Bühler said. “There’s always going to be aspects that banks are required for, and the first one is the storage of your private key.”      For Schwarzenbach, who described himself as a libertarian who runs his own Lightning Network node he made using a Raspberry Pi, bitcoin banking makes sense for the physical security benefits. He wouldn’t want the risk of someone hurting him to get at his bitcoin stash.      Bühler said the young bank already serves high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors from all over the world, excluding the United States, plus a few blockchain startups.      Schwarzenbach added that open source decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms inspired by MakerDAO could eventually offer comparable financial infrastructure to both the general population and the proverbial 1 percent.      “My hope is that we will be able to develop and adopt that [DeFi] infrastructure,” Schwarzenbach said. “And it is my expectation that standards will present themselves with market maturation.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/22/swiss-banks-enter-the-age-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c7532e0f255704cffd7bf355b2207aabf41840c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
