42427105,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPLh,1477345770,Credit Insurance Firm Partners With Blockchain Startup Fluent,"Fluent has partnered with credit insurance provider and Allianz subsidiary Euler Hermes.  Announced today, the blockchain startup used its speaking slot at Money2020 to formally unveil the partnership, as well as demonstrate how users of its trade finance platform can fund trades, settle payments and access receivables.  More ambitious than some distributed ledger projects, Fluent has built its own blockchain technology and business-to-business marketplace for trade finance called the Fluent Trade Asset Marketplace. With the news, Fluent will now leverage its new partner's API to deliver credit insurance within that solution.  CEO Lamar Wilson told the audience:  ""If anyone knows about trade finance, you know this will help us create working capital solutions anywhere in the world.""  The announcement comes amid heightened interest in how distributed ledger solutions could come to revolutionize global trade, though these trials are showing signs of moving toward real markets.  Most recently, Commonwealth Bank and Wells Fargo announced they had successfully used a blockchain to facilitate an exchange between a cotton buyer and seller, while Barclays and its incubator startup Wave completed a similar transaction for $100,000 worth of goods in September.

42399434,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9VT,1477333883,Capital One Testing Blockchain for Healthcare Claims,"US financial services company Capital One is working with blockchain startup Gem on a new healthcare claims project.  Capital One announced a series of new partnerships today aimed at rebooting its treasury services platform. Though details about its work with Gem are light, the firm described the project as one focused on creating new solutions using blockchain within “a scalable revenue cycle management network”.  Capital One framed its work with Gem and others as a means to “reinvent” how its treasury services work.  EVP Patrick Moore said in a statement:  “At Capital One we see the new network models and data analytics capabilities as an exciting opportunity to reinvent treasury management to better meet the needs of clients, not only increasing payment efficiency but also generating actionable information about their business.”  The announcement represents the first publicly confirmed blockchain project for Capital One, a major credit card provider in the US. Earlier this year, the company took part in a $30m funding round for blockchain startup Chain. In August, Capital One hired former WilmerHale counsel Elijah Alper to work on fintech projects, an area of focus that also includes blockchain applications.  In an interview last month with CIO, Capital One Europe CIO Rob Harding said that the company was still in a process of weighing “bigger trends” related to the tech, but indicated that blockchain could ultimately impact how the financial services firm does business.  ""I think it will play a part; one of the interesting avenues for it, is how a ledger-type data layer could help unify a lot of customer transactions - that's something I've investigated personally as a side project,"" he said at the time.

42399428,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9QY,1477327842,BTCC Previews New Mobile Bitcoin Wallet 'Mobi',"""Bitcoin as money, that's the killer app.""  Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, has high hopes for Mobi, the bitcoin exchange startup's new mobile app, released at Money2020 in Las Vegas today. In contrast to other hosted wallets, Lee argues that Mobi succeeds at a difficult balance of being both ""bitcoin first"" and accessible to a global consumer base.  Rather than enable the wallet to hold US dollars, euros or renminbi, Mobi uses bitcoin to provide users with the experience of cash, enabling them to lock their value into an exchange rate that matches their preferred currency.  Lee told CoinDesk:  ""Circle is going a very regulated way, they're doing dollars euros and CNY. But for us, we want to be fighting from the bottom. We want to make a truly global payment platform.""  For example, when Lee sends £10 to his wallet, he's actually sending around 18,000 bits, the smallest denomination of bitcoin. Also noteworthy is that if he were to send the money to someone else, all he'd have to do is enter their phone number.  This feature, Lee suggests, is perhaps the key attribute of Mobi, which he said would remove the friction sometimes inherent in onboarding new bitcoin users.  ""There's no email, no password, no usernames, no two-factor authentication. If you own the phone number, you own the coins for that wallet,"" Lee continued.  Long-term thinking  Onstage, Lee further argued that users will simply become accustomed to treating the ""dollars"" and ""yuan"" in their Mobi accounts as real value given the effectiveness of its hedging system.  Over time, Lee told the audience that by using bitcoin as a payments rail, BTCC will be able to better penetrate a global market than other wallets attempting to straddle both the bitcoin and fiat worlds.  ""Telescope, Telegram, Skype, these are all global communication platforms. There’s no truly global platform for money,"" he continued.  The wallet is now available in public beta.

42399430,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9RX,1477327054,IBM Blockchain Pilot Seeks to Solve 'Last Mile' of Delivery,"IBM is working with a Singapore startup to develop a network of storage lockers connected via blockchain.  FreshTurf is looking to apply the tech to track delivery shipments, with dedicated storage lockers linked up through a distributed ledger platform. According to the two firms, the project is aimed at creating a network of these lockers throughout Singapore, with the goal of providing a “last mile” solution for consumers looking to keep track of their packages more easily.  The project is an early one to emerge from IBM’s BlueMix garage, a global network of innovation hubs that provides a foundation for startups and existing companies to experiment with blockchain and other technologies. The BlueMix network forms part of IBM’s broader strategy for blockchain applications.  The companies said in an announcement today that the hope is to provide a mechanism for consumers to check the status of their package deliveries in real time, explaining:  “Not only can the application of blockchain technology help provide visibility across the fulfilment chain, allowing users to track their parcel and delivery status from the convenience of their phone, it can help stakeholders to conduct shipping transactions in a highly secure and trusted environment.”  The connected locker system, currently in development, uses IBM’s blockchain offerings as a basis. The companies did not say if or when it might scale for commercial use.  The technology has been looked at for potential use in package delivery in the past. Earlier this year, the US Postal Service released a broad report detailing how it might use blockchain to track the movement of packages, while at the same time connecting its national fleet of delivery trucks to a similar system.

Working alongside blockchain startup Skuchain and Australian cotton trading firm Brighann Cotton, the two banks facilitated a transaction between a cotton buyer and seller. In statements, Commonwealth said that the test enabled all parties involved ""to track a shipment in real time"" using a distributed ledger.  Michael Eidel, executive general manager for Commonwealth Cash-flow and Transaction Services office, said in a statement:  ""The interplay between blockchain, smart contracts and the Internet of Things is a significant development towards revolutionising trade transactions that could deliver considerable benefits throughout the global supply chain.”  In the past year, a number of banks, companies and startups have focused squarely on applications for trade finance. The idea is that a distributed database like a blockchain can form the basis for a wholly digitized supply chain, using the tech's design to ward off potential fraud – something that banks like Wells Fargo and Commonwealth say they'll keep exploring for potential commercial uses.

The Linux Foundation-led blockchain effort added 10 new members to its network today, bringing its total number of backers to 95. Notably, a significant portion of the new members hail from outside the US, with four based in China.  While other major names are among the latest batch, Huawei's addition is notable as it may be the largest smartphone vendor to publicly align with blockchain technology. While Samsung has hinted at its interest, Apple and other major market players have largely been silent about the role they could take on in leveraging blockchain for business.  In statements, however, Huawei did not reveal additional details about its interest.  He XiaoXiang, VP of engineering at Huawei, said only:  “Huawei continues to strive to make technical breakthroughs and we believe blockchain is the next evolution to help meet the needs of our customers.""

42399438,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9PZ,1477310892,Illinois State Officials Are Steadily Building a Blockchain Strategy,"The state government of Illinois has quietly established a working group tasked with developing a strategy for integrating blockchain tech.  The working group, put in place earlier this year, draws representatives from several public agencies, including the state’s Department of Innovation and Technology, Department of Financial and Professional Regulation and the Department of of Insurance. Its mandate: identify the ways that blockchain could make government services more efficient, while at the same time making it easier for citizens to do business with state agencies.  Anne Melissa Dowling, director of the state's Department of Insurance, says her office is engaged in an aggressive self-education campaign, with an eye to be among the first agencies of its kind in the US to utilize the technology.  Dowling told CoinDesk:  ""Right now we’re trying to determine if we become a first mover in this space by developing a distributed ledger vision for government. But we’re doing a lot of listening and learning.""  In interview, she cited the use of a distributed ledger to reduce friction between Illinois insurance companies, regulators and policy holders as one area for potential applications. Specifically, the state is looking at how the tech could help speed the process by which actuaries determine the financial consequencies of an event, she said.  But like any state institution, Illinois isn't going to take the blockchain leap overnight. Dowling and her colleagues taking part in the Illinois blockchain working group need to bring industry stakeholders to the table to hammer out what those applications might look like.  The need to build a network effect is high on Dowling’s list of concerns. The need to lobby many different entities in order to build a workable solution is one of the biggest hurdles she expects to encounter. Beyond that, she cited a lack of any legal precedent for such a move, nor the means as of yet to design or build a blockchain-based system.  ""In concept its an absolutely beautiful thing,"" Dowling explained. ""But we need to have a little more experience we need to spend a little more time with the data.""  State blockchain for the citizens  Even if just the Department of Insurance moved some of its services to the blockchain, the scope of the agency's work highlights the scale at which any future service would have to accommodate – and the potential risks. In a 2014 report, the agency said it made $443 million in revenue, dispersing $38m in payments.  The department also runs the state's health insurance marketplace as mandated by the Affordable Care Act of 2010. That exchange, Get Covered Illinois, has faced headwinds in the years since the law's passing (like others of its kind), and in 2015 the government began revamping and streamlining that system – a process that might one day draw on the blockchain working group's work.  Despite the hurdles, that doesn't mean that shift needs to be complicated.  William Mougayar, consultant and author of The Business Blockchain, said in an interview that an invitation-only ""semi-private"" blockchain initiated by the state would be a strong basis to welcome in market stakeholders. The real challenge, he said, lies in getting regulators on board – in this case, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  ""I suspect that the regulatory aspect is a more critical hurdle that will need to be addressed,"" he said.  Consumer focus  For now, Dowling and the rest of the group are still weighing their options. She said that even as she's expanding her own knowledge of the tech and its potential uses for her agency's services, she's still learning.  As part of that process, Dowling is scheduled to participate in a blockchain regulatory panel in Chicago on 8th November. She says her main objective in attending is to get as much of a hands-on education as possible.  In particular, Dowling says she’ll have her eyes open for ""working models"" that demonstrate how blockchain can be implemented in state-level insurance groups.  She concluded:  ""These efforts are really on behalf of consumers to ensure we can serve them in the most efficient and cost-effective way. Illinois wants to look at everything possible to achieve that goal.""

42399447,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9fJ,1477292621,"In Milestone Release, Chain Open-Sources its Blockchain Tech","""We're going to have to have a tremendous amount of support.""  Somewhere in the middle of a Las Vegas sports bar, Adam Ludwin finally explains why he's been talking about spending $10,000 on a Slack channel. Two years after starting as a bitcoin API provider, pivoting to focus on enterprise blockchains and fighting for partners against the likes of R3CEV, the CEO of blockchain startup Chain is ready to make his big move.  On Monday, Chain is officially open-sourcing its blockchain platform, Chain Protocol, at Money2020, at which point the technology the startup has built with select partners (and first announced as ChainOS) will be freely available to developers worldwide to download and install.  The release further coincides with the unveiling of extensive new resources for developers, offerings that filled Ludwin with a enthusiasm as he scrolled through page after page of a 100-page specification and 24-page white paper. (For a time, the only thing longer as the pages fly by seems to be the pennant drought the Chicago Cubs are poised to break on the TV behind him).  But if Ludwin succeeds on his vision, he believes the release of Chain Protocol could be just as big a part of history. Indeed, he went so far as to call the release the ""biggest yet"" for the company, one that he hopes will drive blockchain adoption among financial firms globally.  Ludwin told CoinDesk:  ""I don't want to be a gatekeeper. I want people to go from PowerPoint to pilot. Now most banks will say, 'Yes we're doing something'. What are they doing? They have a strategy in a PowerPoint and they're trying to figure out how to build it.""  In this way, Ludwin sees this release of 30,000 lines of code as one that will enable enterprise firms to begin using a blockchain built for business without permission. He argues that Chain Protocol offers something truly novel in a market where more mature public blockchains ""aren't fit for purpose"" and other permissioned ledger systems remain in the development phase.  To drive the point home, Ludwin said that Chain recently tested its software by attempting to see if Chain Protocol could process ""the entire day's trades for the Nasdaq"" on its ledger system in real time, a test he said it passed.  While limited (the test only explored whether Chain could sign and get a single validation for each trade), Ludwin asserted that the trial proved his startup's technology can meet the demands that will be placed on live networks.  He added:  ""There's no protocol limitation to the scalability.""  Out of the box  Released as part of the package are actually two pieces of technology.  The first is the Chain Protocol, the underlying cryptographic protocol that is maintained by Chain and that defines the rules for participants in new blockchain networks. The second is Chain Core, which implements the protocol and elements like its key generation scheme.  In this way, Ludwin said that Chain Core enables organizations to ""manage [the] issuance, ownership and control of digital assets"" in a similar manner to existing public blockchain networks.  ""With bitcoin, you have the protocol, you have the node and you can connect the node to main blockchain or the testnet. It's same with us, there's Chain Protocol and Chain Core, and you can connect that to our testnet or you can start or join a network,"" he said.  Unlike bitcoin or other public networks, however, the Chain Protocol assumes that participants in the blockchain will have some inherent trust (or at least a previously defined relationship).  For example, Chain Protocol uses a federation of block signers in which one entity is designated to have a ""privileged role"" in the network. The full white paper reasons that it makes sense to have a ""single company or utility"" that is responsible for the network.  ""If the block generator behaves maliciously, or is intentionally shut down, it is probably better (in these use cases) for the network to stop. Such misbehavior can be detected and dealt with out-of-band,"" the white paper reads.  Other differences include that nodes need only track unspent transaction outputs (not the full network state) and that public keys can be pseudonymous, obscuring the parties that perform certain actions to protect trade information.  Design choices  But while Ludwin said that Chain's technology represents the best of breed, he also acknowledged that its users will need the help of other service providers as they seek to take prototypes and proofs-of-concepts live.  For example, as a software provider, Chain isn't directly involved with helping its users ensure builds are compliant with their end markets or that the networks operate to the highest degree of efficiency.  ""When you're creating an asset, Chain Protocol doesn't know that you're the legal issuer,"" Ludwin remarked in one example.  Chain also isn't seeking to provide the hosting infrastructure for either its testnet or for live projects that utilize the technology. Its testnet, for instance, is a collaboration with the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3) at Cornell University, which runs a network with more than 1,000 nodes.  Further, the software is available on Microsoft Azure, a service designed to allow developers to build private blockchain networks using the tech giant's hosted computing infrastructure.  ""You can run Chain Core on Azure or on [your own] premises. There is no single chain network,"" Ludwin continued.  Path ahead  Looking forward, Ludwin said that Chain plans to soon offer an enterprise version of Chain Core that will play a key role in helping the startup monetize its technology with more robust features.  Additional tools include specialized firmware that aims to make compromising cryptographic keys more difficult, as well as other features that Ludwin said will enable the networks to run with ""high availability"".  ""It's the same but it has additional security and scalability features that you don't need when you're doing test development,"" Ludwin said.  Ludwin added that Chain intends to work further on projects with enterprise customers, and that this is where the startup's new slack channel will play a role. Notably, the announcement is days removed from the news Visa will use the technology offering to launch a live blockchain in 2017, a development that could likely spur a spike in public interest.  All in all, Ludwin said he is left with a feeling that he's now played a winning hand in establishing market leadership with traditional enterprises, and that from here on out, the company will enter a new phase.  ""All of the last two years of work goes public on Monday,"" he said.  Somewhere in the background, the Cubs begin to celebrate, though for a moment it's hard to tell who's more content with the victory.

42399432,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9SW,1477269348,Blockchain Ideologies Clash as Money2020 Spotlights Capital Markets,"How much of the financial back-end should be rebooted by blockchain?  A discussion on blockchain's use in capital markets got a much-needed jolt today at Money2020 in Las Vegas when a small argument broke out over this question toward the end of an afternoon session.  Despite broad agreement on the technology's viability in this area of the financial industry, divisions began to emerge when Credit Suisse's Emmanuel Aidoo challenged Nasdaq's Yolanda Goettsch over how inefficiencies in the equities markets could be resolved with blockchain.  For example, while Goettsch argued that the market today is already ""very liquid"" and ""very resilient"", while Judd Bagley, head of Overstock subsidiary tØ, put forth a starkly different categorization.  Goettsch asserted that just because blockchain could enable a 10-minute settlement time, a advocated by tØ, that doesn't mean that would be beneficial for the industry to upend its existing processes.  Goettsch told the audience:  ""If you have to pre-verify that assets and cash exist, that changes everything. That's just not how the markets operate right now. We use that time to confirm that the regulatory processes are met, there are a lot of players in the system like market makers, high-frequency trading firms that don't operate [that way].""  Bagley, however, asserted that perhaps technology should disintermediate parties that are now unnecessary, though the tone of the argument took aim at what he inferred was the bias inherent in comments from financial institutions.  ""There are a lot of people who will be disintermediated. [But they're] the people at Wall Street they see at lunch everyday. We're in Utah, we don't care. We've taken a burn it down and start over approach,"" Bagley said.  Bagley went on to contend that systems like blockchain would make events like the 2010 flash crash ""impossible"", while reducing the length of time they take to investigate.  Notably, Aidoo also played a role as mediator in the conversation, suggesting that he sees the transition to blockchain in capital markets as one that will expedite settlement gradually, accelerating it so that trades settle on the same day instead of three days later.  Aido further hinted that certain affected entities, like high-frequency traders, are already working on blockchain pilots, and that Credit Suisse is exploring how the balance of issues discussed in the conversation should be best mediated given the potential savings.  However, he sought to suggest that the technology should lead to a rethinking of existing processes.  ""We should be thinking about moving that word 'clearing' out of our process,"" he said.  Impediments to action  Later on, R3 general counsel Jacob Farber discussed how issues like the one debated onstage have so far held back collaborations between the open-source blockchain community and traditional financial institutions.  The comment also provided an example of the role R3 has played in increasing understanding of the technology. For instance, Faber cited how R3 has provided a sandbox for the testing of technologies including ethereum and Ripple by major banks.  ""There's this tough problem of what can and should the technology replace. Figuring out what the right answer, to tear it down, if you're one of the financial exchanges, you think that's a terrible idea. The industry is trying to find a way to make sense [of this],"" he said.  Elsewhere, there was broad agreement that there are inefficiencies in the current financial markets, as well as an increasing interest in blockchain applications and the role they could play in finding solutions to these types of issues.  Scott Robinson, FinTech director at Plug and Play, for example, related an anecdote about how the blockchain message is resonating.  ""Three years ago, I remember talking to some executives at Exxon Mobil. A year ago they said they're looking at blockchain,"" he said.  Aidoo summed up this transition further, laying out his vision for the industry in 2016 and beyond.  He added:  ""2015 was the year of hype, 2016 was the year of the POC and 2017 will be year of delivery.""
