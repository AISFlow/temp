Rob Leathern, the company's product management director, wrote in a Jan. 30 blog post that the new policy targets ""ads that promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency.""  Leathern went on to write:  ""We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.""  Most users of the social media site have likely encountered ads for initial coin offerings, including those promising sky-high investment returns as well as bonuses for early participation. Other advertisements seen on the platform pitch investment advice around the crypto market.  Such ads, Leathern argued, are being targeted as part of an evolving policy against potentially fraudulent activities on the site.  Leathern added that the policy extends to other platforms under Facebook's purview, including the popular photo-sharing app Instagram. He suggested that the policy could be changed in the future, though he didn't offer any kind of timeline on that front.  ""This policy is intentionally broad while we work to better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices, and enforcement will begin to ramp up across our platforms including Facebook, Audience Network and Instagram,"" he wrote.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and Tether, the company behind the controversial USDT token, have been subpoenaed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to a new report from Bloomberg.  Citing an unnamed source, Bloomberg said that the CFTC had sent queries to both companies. The news comes days after CoinDesk reported that Tether's relationship with auditing firm Friedman LLC had ""dissolved,"" though it still remains unclear which party moved to curtail the work. Friedman had been working on an audit with Tether, which is closely linked to the British Virgin Islands-based Bitfinex.  ""We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations. It is our policy not to comment on any such requests,"" the companies said in a statement to Bloomberg. A representative declined further comment when reached.  The news is likely to further inflame the controversy around Tether's USDT token, which functions as a kind of synthetic dollar. Critics have argued that the token isn't backed on a 1-to-1 ratio with the U.S. dollar as otherwise claimed and that the tokens generated by Tether in recent weeks have been used to boost the price of bitcoin, particularly during times of market weakness.  The report also sparked a rout in the price of bitcoin, sending it below $10,000 as word emerged about the CFTC subpoenas. At press time, the price of bitcoin is trading at $9,957.88.

In the suit, Page accuses BitConnect of operating a Ponzi scheme, noting that investors were required to transfer their cryptocurrencies to the exchange in return for BCC tokens, which would then act as the primary investment.  Page cited BitConnect’s claims that it would provide a 3,000 percent return over the course of a year or a monthly return of 40 percent as reasons why investors would use BitConnect.  While Page acknowledges that BitConnect includes a disclosure that investors may not see a return on their deposits, the disclosure does outline various reasons why this may happen.  The filing continued:  ""Not listed is that disclosure was a risk Bitconnect could unilaterally shut down its lending platform, convert all of people’s investments into BCC, tank the market for BCC by eliminating any future value of BCC, and close up shop.""  The suit also claims that Ryan Maasen, an Oklahoma resident, acted as an unregistered agent for BitConnect, and had profited from misleading investors about the potential returns they would see.  Unlike the previous legal filing, submitted in Florida by the law firm Silver Miller, Page's suit limits itself to the companies associated with BitConnect and Maasen. Still, both lawsuits were filed in an effort to seek recompense for every investor who lost money in BitConnect.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/01/30/bitconnect-hit-with-second-lawsuit-over-ponzi-allegations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ac5e77b5a8e0eea963e21cb17b8cad0b94b852e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

XEM prices reached an all-time high of at $2.09 on Jan. 4, before falling to $0.72 on Jan. 17, according to CoinMarketCap data. The recovery that ensued ran out of steam at the Jan. 21 high of $1.22.  Prices then hit a low of around $0.78 on Jan. 26 seemingly due to reports that 500 million XEM tokens, worth roughly $420 million at the time, had been stolen from Japanese exchange Coincheck.  While it was perhaps to be expected that XEM might continue the decline, the token turned higher and ran into offers on Jan. 27 at $1.08. It has since been in a slide, however, and, as of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.84.  The price action witnessed in the last two weeks indicates the cryptocurrency has created a series of lower highs and higher lows – i.e. narrowing price range, popularly known as a ""symmetrical triangle"" formation.  At press time, the technical chart indicates XEM is close to breaching the symmetrical triangle on the downside – a move which could revive the long-run bearish outlook.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per HitBTC) shows:  Symmetrical triangle pattern (marked by blue lines) – a bearish continuation pattern. A close (as per UTC) below the triangle support of $0.8471 would signal revival/continuation of the sell-off from the Jan. 4 record high.  Prices are flirting with key support $0.8471 (confluence of triangle support and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement July–January rally).  The relative strength index (RSI) favors the bears.  View  A daily close (as per UTC) below $0.8471 would open doors a drop to $0.55 (Jan. 16 low) and $0.51 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of July-January rally).

The information, as of 9:46 a.m. EST, shows a volume of 2,100 and a price of $24.88 per share.

The Texas-based firm AriseBank, together with its co-founders Jared Rice Sr. and Stanley Ford, is being charged by the U.S. financial watchdog for alleged fraud and issuing unregistered securities during its recent initial coin offering (ICO), according to the latest court filing.  Submitted to the Northern district court of Texas, the complaint was filed on Jan. 25, just one day before the Texas State's Department of Banking announced a cease-and-desist order on AriseBank's operation went into effect.  As reported by CoinDesk previously, AriseBank is a cryptocurrency banking firm that claims to offer several banking products related to cryptocurrency.Its ICO was notably endorsed by former professional boxer Evander Holyfield.  Based on a previous press release dated on Jan. 18, the company started an ICO to launch its own token dubbed AriseCoin around November last year and claimed to have raised over $1 billion through both private and public token sales.  According to the filing, SEC says the sale was originally scheduled to conclude on Jan. 27 and argues that the token issuance, which did not exclude residents from the U.S., falls under the scope of securities. Furthermore, since neither AriseBank nor the token – called AriseCoin – was registered with SEC, the agency alleges that the firm has violated securities regulations.  The securities agency also argues that, in order to facilitate its token sale, the company also made false statements to potential investors.  In a Facebook post published on Oct. 4, the firm took direct aim at the SEC in defending its model, stating, ""Rather than close our ICOs and shiver in fear, companies like AriseBank have geared up for the coming fight with the SEC.""  Disagreeing with SEC's stance that tokens may be considered and regulated as securities, the firm argued:  ""The fact remains that a private company can issue private stock to ANYONE who wants to invest in their company and/or products without the SEC’s involvement in any way.""  Also in its Jan. 18 press release, AriseBank detailed that the company was acquiring two FDIC-insured banks, KFMC Bank Holding Company and TPMG.  However, the SEC alleges this information to be false, since neither of the two banks supposedly being purchased was insured by FDIC, the federal agency that insures deposits and oversees financial institutions for consumer protection.  The SEC continued:  ""Because of the ongoing nature of the fraudulent offering and risk of asset dissipation, the SEC seeks emergency relief – including temporary restraining orders, asset freezes, and the appointment of a receiver over AriseBank.""

42428491,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8HVh,1517320814,"'Bitcoin Could Alter the World,' Says Former US Senator","Former New Hampshire governor and three-term senator Judd Gregg has said he believes bitcoin could alter how the world views currency.  In an opinion piece published by The Hill yesterday, Gregg outlined why he thinks people believe in bitcoin, how bitcoin could be used and what it could mean for the global economy.  Briefly comparing bitcoin to gold, Gregg noted that the latter has value because it is rare and widely accepted by banks, while the former is supported primarily by the belief of its holders. The key difference is that bitcoin is not held by central banks at this time, he wrote.  Since bitcoin is not controlled by any nation, government or central bank, Gregg said, ""it sounds so good that one is tempted to say, 'Throw in some pixie dust and it is off to never-never land.'""  He continued:  ""However, that would be too traditional a view. Bitcoin could indeed alter the entire world of commercial transactions.”    Should people have sufficient belief that bitcoin or subsequent cryptocurrencies have real value, then it could usher in ""a new era,"" he said, one that would have a ""staggering"" potential as a world currency.    However, Gregg also noted the importance of the dollar in the world economy today, saying it was ""difficult to project a time when the dollar will not stand as a core element of world commerce.""  The ex-senator's comments come at a time when U.S. politicians are awakening to the technological and fiscal possibilities of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.  In June 2017, Nevada Senator Ben Kieckhefer sponsored a new law paving the way for the state's broad bid to attract new blockchain startups. The bill prohibits the taxation of blockchain technology in Nevada, while at the same time recognizing the legality of blockchain signatures.

42428478,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8H7h,1517317243,Hyperledger Sawtooth Is Ready for Business Use,"Long considered one of the most promising code bases hosted by the Hyperledger blockchain consortium, Intel-contributed Sawtooth software is officially ready for enterprise use.  Revealed today, version 1.0 of the technology provides what might be expected, features inspired by bitcoin and other public blockchains, but repositioned for enterprise.  Yet, what its team of 50 contributors — from startups including Bitwise and R3, and corporates including Red Hat and Capital One — hope will distinguish the solution is its modular functionality, designed to give enterprises across industries a head start on meeting consumer and regulatory demands.  Among the early companies already using Hyperledger Sawtooth are telecommunications giants Huawei, which is building a decompiler for the software, and T-Mobile which is building an identity platform, along with e-commerce giant Amazon, which now lists Sawtooth among its blockchain partners.  Indeed, Intel venture technical lead and Hyperledger Sawtooth maintainer Dan Middleton positioned the software as a way for enterprises with demands that exceed the capabilities of available public blockchains to capitalize on their benefits.  Middleton told CoinDesk:  ""We feel that if companies really want to adopt blockchain, or a distributed ledger, then we shouldn't forgo the basic blockchain properties in taking something from a public chain to enterprise usage.""  Stepping back, Hyperledger Sawtooth is Hyperledger's second open-source blockchain platform to emerge with an enterprise-ready 1.0 version, following closely on Hyperledger Fabric, which was contributed by IBM and launched last year.  From a development perspective, the launch of 1.0 software solutions is an important step to any code base, as it signifies that the maintainers are committed to the core features, giving coders a sense of confidence that anything they build won't break as a result of future upgrades.  ""For us, it's a big event, both for the Sawtooth team because of stability milestone. But for Hyperledger, it's evidence of a growing community of developers working on blockchain,"" said Kelly Olson, another Sawtooth maintainer and member of the Hyperledger consortium's technical steering committee.  A familiar touch  But beyond the potential importance to developers, there's another key differentiator highlighted by the Sawtooth team in the launch: the innovative method by which computing networks running the software will be able to forge consensus on mission-critical events.  Specifically, Sawtooth marks the business debut of a consensus mechanism called PoET — or proof of elapsed time — a variation on an older system called Byzantine Fault Tolerance that lets users reach consensus, even in an environment where counterparties don't know each other.  By comparison, other permissioned blockchains require that users know and trust each other. In this way, the blockchain platform is designed to resist denial-of-service attacks that become more likely in a more public blockchain, or one in which unknown parties might interact.  Still, compatibility is also being sought with other blockchains of this nature. Notable in the final version is support for the Solidity smart contract language, pioneered by the ethereum blockchain.  Smart contracts can also be written in Go, JavaScript, Python and more.  ""The maintaners aren't promoting an unpermissioned version of Sawtooth,"" said Olson. ""But we're trying to make the resiliency still available.""  Hardware integration  In addition to certain public blockchain features, Hyperledger Sawtooth has become known for the ease with which it can be integrated with hardware security solutions.  And central to Sawtooth's PoET consensus mechanism is a streamlined ability to integrate with hardware security solutions called ""trusted execution environments,"" among which is Intel's newly launched scalable Xeon processor.  The potential hardware integration was originally seen as a controversial solution because it places the security considerations of a decentralized ledger behind the protection of potentially fallible hardware. But the Sawtooth maintainers emphasized this is part of a balancing act between leveraging the strengths of public blockchains with transaction volume and security demands of enterprise companies.  Further, they clarified that while a single company may provide the hardware that creates these trusted execution environments, Sawtooth hasn't restricted that company to Intel.  Olson concluded:  ""Sawtooth is a hardware-agnostic platform. There is no dependence of Intel hardware.""

42428496,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8Hfh,1517316341,$10K Exposed? Bitcoin Bulls Fail to Defend Price Floor,"Bitcoin is looking down after the bulls failed to defend a key level in the early Asian hours, price chart analysis suggests.  Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) fell below $11,000 at 01:44 UTC today and hit an intraday low of $10,805 at 03:29 UTC. The recovery seen in the next few hours ran into offers at $11,063.80, pushing bitcoin (BTC) back to near the intraday lows. The BPI was last seen around $10,840.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has depreciated by 3.47 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source OnChinaFX.  On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, BTC was last seen changing hands at $10,822. So, week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is largely unchanged – indicating a failure on the part of the bulls to capitalize on the sharp recovery from the Jan. 17 low of $9,005.  Comments on social media indicate the investor community is cautiously bearish on bitcoin. The price chart analysis too indicates that prices could suffer a quick drop to sub-$10,000 levels in the next few hours.  4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  BTC has breached the rising trendline.  The relative strength index (RSI) has rolled over from the bullish territory (above 50.00) and is trending lower in favor of the bears.  The directional movement index (DMI) is biased lower and indicates the bearish move could gather pace in the next few hours.  The DMI comprises of the average directional index (ADX) (indicating the strength of the trend), plus the direction indicator (DI+) and minus direction indicator (DI-).  A rising or falling ADX shows a trend is strong. The outlook is bullish when the DI+ is above the DI-, and vice versa.  On the chart above, the DI- (red) moved above the DI+ (green) yesterday after prices fell from $11,570 to $11,279. So the bias is bearish.  Meanwhile, the ADX (black) has bottomed out and is showing signs of life (bearish move is strengthening), adding credence to the breach of the key rising trendline on the price chart.  View  BTC could test $10,350 (former descending trendline support).  A 4-hour close below $10,350 could yield a sell-off to $9,000 levels.  Bearish invalidation would be seen only on a break above $11,690.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

42428488,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8HPh,1517302856,This Token Promises Not to Spam You on Social Media,"If one token's newly announced marketing strategy is any indication, the Federal Trade Commission may soon have more warnings to send to social influencers.  Announced today, Singapore-based marketing company Jet8 is launching an initial coin offering (ICO) designed to scale its system for rewarding regular users who effectively promote brands on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and more. As such, the idea effectively merges a contentious ad model with the red-hot crypto market, itself no stranger to controversy.  But cryptocurrency doesn't actually mark that big of a shift for Jet8.  In an age where elite Instagram models can earn thousands from a single post, the company has made it easier for brands to scale their social reach by enlisting more average users. Users, in turn, are able to leverage the Jet8 app to share photos or posts with branded frames that then get distributed to major social media platforms.  Once Jet8 launches its own cryptocurrency, however, those rewards will take the form of fungible money. And there's little risk to brands because they only have to pay rewards for shares that garner actual reactions.  This design is where the benefit lies.  Today, the company's influencers receive rewards in the form of a virtual currency tracked on its internal ledger system. Jet8 has awarded 4 billion of its virtual tokens to date, points which then must be redeemed at convenience stores in Asia or through an app store.  But with a traditional virtual currency, Jet8 must rely on traditional tactics, negotiating deals with companies to make the tokens redeemable. In this way, the company believes an ethereum-based cryptocurrency can open up the platform to brands.  Shannon Cullum, chief marketing officer for the startup, said that cryptocurrency gives the product more value, stating:  ""The increased transparency, flexibility and scalability, that's the rationale for integrating the blockchain into the project.""  Influencer offerings  To demonstrate the potential of its platform, Jet8 is giving supporters a chance to earn tokens by posting testimonial videos about why they are excited about the token sale. The more engagement these videos receive, the more J8T they will yield.  Cullum himself even kicked off the contest on Instagram.  In contrast to this user-first model, Jet8 has worked under more of an agency approach. In the past, brands would come to it with an idea for a campaign, a target audience and a budget. It would create brand assets for the campaign and message influencers about the opportunity.  Jet8's secret weapon has been its ability to track the success of different posts. It follows them as they go out onto the web, and it tracks which ones generate engagement. Brands can watch the reach stack up as the campaign goes on through a dashboard that the company provides.  The dashboard squares with a larger trend of brands bringing influencer marketing in-house.  For example, Jet8 recently launched an app-as-a-service model called the Full Stack App. A brand can create its own app that works exactly like Jet8's, except it can be customized to look like the brand's own technology, from which it can launch its campaigns directly.  ""The advantage of that model is they will be able to create these communities and in a sense decentralize the whole thing,"" Cullum explained. ""It's the same technology, the same methodology.""  Real rewards  Still, jumpstarting the Jet8 token by decentralizing a network won't necessarily be easy, even with tools that could enable such an expansion.  To start, there's the matter of cultivating a user base. The company will aim to sell $36 million worth of its tokens in an ICO, auctioning off 30 percent of a total 1.5 billion token supply. (Tokens sold in the public sale will go for $0.10 per J8T, the company said.)  Overall, Jet8 expects to raise 70 percent of its ICO goal through a private sale in advance. And while it has declined to disclose investors in the round, it did offer advisory board details. Members include Uriel Peled (Cointree Capital), Eyal Herzog (Bancor) and the founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, Jon Matonis.  Yet, if this token catches on, its hard to imagine that social media won't become an even more intense stream of brand messaging. After all, there's no denying it's already getting weird among major influencers using traditional tools.  Still, Cullum argued that baldly avaricious sharing won't be rewarded.  ""If I post a Coca-Cola asset on my Facebook page and it's just blatant advertising. I probably won't get any likes comments or shares,"" he said.  As such, the Jet8 app and token seeks to guide people to post authentic experience with campaign branding that people would respond to either way.  ""The way we design the assets, it's very much about key moments,"" Cullum said.

42428483,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8HFh,1517295641,JP Morgan Blockchain Spin-Off Raises $2.25 Million,"Smart contract startup Kadena has raised $2.25 million in a pre-A financing private-placement SAFT round for its new blockchain project.  According to the startup, Metastable, Kilowatt Capital, Coinfund and Multicoin Capital all invested in Kadena through a private-placement SAFT round.  The funding goes to support Chainweb, a project focused on scaling and security issues and realized through the combination of multiple peer blockchains to process transactions, rather than the use of one single decentralized blockchain like the one that underlies bitcoin, said Kadena co-founder Stuart Popejoy.  By using multiple chains, users can avoid the network issues which plague other public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum, the former JP Morgan Chase blockchain developer told CoinDesk.  He explained:  ""A Cryptokitties-like application can run on five or six chains of its own, while a massive [initial coin offering] can happen on another chain in the network and they won't slow each other down. And even if you run into an issue where you have congestion, you can provision chains to make up for the load.""  The different chains integrate their Merkle roots with each other, ensuring that while they each act as a unique blockchain, they can still share information and create a consensus among the ledgers.  Unlike other scaling proposals, Chainweb's parallel network model maintains security without using side channels or only using part of a blockchain to process a large number of transactions. Popejoy said Kadena's tests found an extremely high level of security with their proposal, which intends to produce roughly 1,000 different chains eventually.  In addition, each chain will produce Kadena's token, though the exact function that determines how many tokens are released and what timeline they will be released over has not yet been determined, Popejoy said.  That being said, the Chainweb protocol will ensure that the same coin cannot exist on two chains at once.  ""It is a single currency, when you want to move coins from one chain to the next it's a [Simple Payment Verification] so coins are deleted on one chain before being created on the other,"" he continued.  The project began as a way to develop better smart contract language for users, Popejoy said. It integrates with Pact, the smart contracts service already offered by Kadena to enterprise customers.  However, Chainweb will go beyond businesses and become a public network, he said.  Using Chainweb's parallel network model, Kadena hopes to increase volume for a single token up to 10,000 transactions per second while maintaining low transaction fees, according to the press release.

42428499,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8Hjh,1517288474,Bitfury Enters Bitcoin Crime-Fighting Business,"Bitfury isn't waiting for law enforcement to clean up the bitcoin space.  After years of working with government agencies leery of bitcoin's seedy past, the blockchain services firm best known for its bitcoin transaction processing business has decided to take matters into its own hands. Launched today, a number of tools collectively identified as Crystal are intended to make it easy for users to identify and investigate criminal activity on the world's largest blockchain.  But that's not to say that the end goal of Crystal is philanthropic.  Developed over a two-year period with feedback from former senior-level government officials, the platform was ultimately created to help bitcoin once and for all move past its association with black market transactions.  The next time potential Bitfury customers balk at getting involved with the cryptocurrency, the CEO of Bitfury Group, Valery Vavilov hopes Crystal will provide a solution.  Vavilov told CoinDesk:  ""The industry needs some very user-friendly tools so that you can track bitcoin transactions and see if this bitcoin address that you're getting money from is green or black.""  Beginning today, a free demo license of the Crystal software will be made available to qualified individuals, with pricing for web and enterprise subscriptions to be released in March.  The core of the toolkit is a detailed risk scoring solution that helps law enforcement agents and investigators trace suspicious transactions to a final address, or a point of withdrawal. By tracking the relationships between so-called ""bad actors,"" Crystal will generate a score of the likelihood a particular address is related to illegal activity.  The results of the data analysis are then presented in a visual graph that can be integrated with other software tools and used to prepare legal reports as part of larger investigations.  Other tools enable the autonomous tracking of bitcoin addresses over time, custom reports that can be sent based on predetermined criteria or triggered by transactions between groups and advanced services that include previously revealed technology for ""untangling"" transactions that have been sent through laundering software, called mixers.  ""We are analyzing the web, we are analyzing the forums, we are analyzing different kinds of sources, and combining this information and getting some kind of result if this transaction is risky or not,"" said Vavilov.  Untangling from the competition  Overall, Bitfury's entrance into the bitcoin security space marks the latest expansion for the company, founded in 2012 as a bitcoin mining startup.  As part of a larger push to gain industry adoption of blockchain technology, Bitfury last year entered the blockchain industry more broadly, with the launch of Exonum, its own blockchain infrastructure aimed at enterprise users.  Now, to further distinguish Bitfury's enterprise offering, Crystal Pro will be deployable in a customer's in-house architecture, a service designed to extend beyond simply tracking bitcoin transactions and into providing an additional security layer for bitcoin companies.  The expansion is important, as a niche industry surrounding blockchain analytics has emerged over the past couple years.  Among the most notable competitors offering users a way to investigate the bitcoin blockchain are Elliptic, which has raised $5 million, Chainalysis, which has raised $1.6 million, and Skry, which was last year acquired by Bloq.  ""The bottom line is it is very critical for the blockchain and all of this technology to really advance,"" said Bitfury global chief communications officer and former White House deputy press secretary Jamie Smith.  She added:  ""And if bad people are doing bad things, then nobody really benefits that's not in anyone's interest.""  The justice league  The origin of Crystal goes back to about 2015, when Bitfury was working to help overcome the reluctance of financial institutions and government agencies who were curious about the cryptocurrency.  At the time, Bitfury had just helped kick off the first Blockchain Summit in 2014 at bitcoin supporter and billionaire Richard Branson's personal retreat, Necker Island.  Gathered at the event were numerous blockchain entrepreneurs, several people from Bitfury — and former 15-year veteran of the U.S. Department of Justice, Jason Weinstein, who played a crucial role in inspiring Crystal.  According to Smith, it was at Necker Island where the seeds were first sown for the Blockchain Alliance to explore how private companies could join in the public fight against criminal activity.  Weinstein, who now directs the alliance is also a strategic advisor to Bitfury confirmed Smith's story.  He reflected:  ""I’ve often said that bitcoin is friendlier to cops than it is to crooks, and that criminals should run, not walk, away from using bitcoin. With Crystal, they should be running away even faster.""  Disclaimer: Bitfury global communications officer Jamie Smith is a member of CoinDesk's advisory board.
