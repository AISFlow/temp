It could be anything from videos, JPG images, artworks, or music, to name a few. They are bought and sold online, often using crypto coins, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos. Each NFT has unique identification codes and metadata. Even though they&apos;ve been around starting around 2014, NFTs are now acquiring a reputation since they are becoming an undeniably famous method for purchasing and selling digital artwork. Assortments of variables have added to the ascent of NFTs, including the connection with the metaverse and celebrities hopping on the NFT bandwagon. NFT sales have taken off, with some notable ones rounding up millions of dollars. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), The Sandbox, and CryptoPunks are only a couple of the undertakings that have transformed the NFT industry, both imaginatively and monetarily. As of 2022, sales of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs have totaled over US$1 billion, and celebrities have purchased these non-fungible tokens. Despite being among the first NFTs, CryptoPunks were not initially highly coveted. However, their prices began to skyrocket in 2021 as the broader NFT space expanded.

42395538,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxc3N,1650411500,First Mover Asia: Is Germany Really the Most Crypto-Friendly Jurisdiction? Maybe Not; Bitcoin Gains,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin traded higher alongside U.S. stocks, reaching $41,360.  Insights: Germany might not be as crypto-friendly as its top ranking implies.  Technician's take: Bitcoin's recovery phase remains intact, albeit within a wide trading range.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.     Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $41,386 +1.4%  Ether (ETH): $3,102 +2%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector EOS EOS +8.1% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL +5.8% Smart Contract Platform Polkadot DOT +3.7% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Bitcoin Cash BCH −0.5% Currency Stellar XLM −0.3% Smart Contract Platform  Bitcoin Price Rises for Second Day on Hopes for Soft Landing  By Bradley Keoun and Angelique Chen  Bitcoin (BTC) continued its recovery from a five-week low of around $38,700 on Monday.  Recently, the largest cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at $41,300, still well off the high around $48,000 a few weeks ago.  “The macro landscape is looking positive, in my opinion,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock in a newsletter.  Sotiriou thinks the economy will have a soft landing despite many analysts forecasting a recession. He is bullish on bitcoin and equities even though the U.S. Federal Reserve might jack up interest rates by 0.5 percentage point next month – double the 0.25 percentage-point increases seen in recent years.  Last week, crypto funds suffered outflows for the second straight week, with some $97 million of redemptions, possibly due to ""bitcoin becoming increasingly interest-rate sensitive.""  According to Glassnode, a large amount of bitcoin supply has been accumulated between the $38,000 and $45,000 price range, as reported by CoinDesk's Damanick Dantes in Market Wrap. That suggests price-insensitive traders hold much of bitcoin's supply above the $40,000 price level.  ""Traders have still yet to make high conviction bets to the upside or downside,"" according to analysts from the investment research firm FundStrat.  Coin Metrics, a blockchain analysis firm, noted that Bitcoin is approaching the halfway point between the original blockchain's third and fourth reward halvings. (They happen every 210,000 data blocks, or roughly every four years; the next one is scheduled to happen on May 4, 2024.)  ""Halvings are the core feature of Bitcoin’s programmatic monetary policy,"" Coin Metrics wrote.  In traditional markets, U.S. stocks rose as analysts noted that investors had become too bearish, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield rose to 2.94%, the highest since 2018.  Elsewhere in crypto, CoinDesk's Tracy Wang reported that the prolific decentralized finance (DeFi) developer Andre Cronje appears to be back in crypto after abruptly quitting the industry last month.  Markets  S&P 500: +1.6%  DJIA: +1.5%  Nasdaq: +2.2%  Gold: $1,952 -0.4%  Insights  No, Germany Isn’t the World’s Most Crypto-Friendly Country  By Sam Reynolds  What’s the first thing you associate ""EU"" with when it comes to business? Devastatingly high taxes and a fierce bureaucracy.  So it's of some surprise when Germany recently took top spot away from Singapore as the world’s most crypto-friendly jurisdiction, according to a ranking by CoinCub.  The rationale? No taxation on crypto if you sell it after a year of holding. If you sell it (over 600 euros, or $648) prior to that one-year point, you are taxed under the usual capital gains regime.  To be sure, this is a very good thing for long-term HODLERs. If you are long bitcoin and want to stack sats, this tax regime will treat you very well.  However, this doesn’t work very well for decentralized finance (DeFi). Decentralized exchanges, yield farming, liquidity mining, all of this relies on rapid trades and transactions. It's what underpins this fancy new machine, which has over $100 billion in value currently locked in.  So a DeFi trader in Germany is going to have a nasty tax bill come tax time. Figuring out the tax liability is difficult, when the average month of a DeFi trader is a complex and intricate web. Crypto derivatives trading – which pumps through hundreds of billions of dollars a day in volume – is also subject to the usual capital gains tax, too. Germany’s crypto friendliness quickly slips away if you look at it under this rubric.  Crypto has naturally gravitated to hubs like Singapore because of the lack of capital gains tax. Singapore is an island city with no natural resources, so in order to jump-start its development as a hub it created a tax-friendly regime to encourage trade.  With no capital gains tax there’s no need to worry about the length of holding when experimenting with new protocols. You’re just able to trade.  Granted, Singapore has made some moves that would be considered ""anti-crypto,"" but this still doesn’t mean the country should be considered crypto unfriendly.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) discourages crypto trading by the general public because it knows that if enough people get rekt after leveraging their retirement savings, they will complain to politicians who will ask for more oversight and control – this oversight and control just isn’t in the DNA of a financial hub like Singapore.  But despite this discouragement, the lack of capital gains tax still exists and anyone that wants to trade can go right ahead. Singapore also discourages other behavior like drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco, and accompanies both with hefty vice taxes. No such vice tax exists for crypto.     Technician's take  Bitcoin Stabilizes Above $40K; Resistance at $43K-$46K  By Damanick Dantes  Bitcoin (BTC) returned above $40,000, which is the midpoint of its three-month long price range. Still, the cryptocurrency faces initial resistance at $43,500, which could stall the current upside in price.  BTC was trading around $41,200 during the New York trading day, and was up 2% over the past 24 hours.  The relative strength index (RSI) on intraday charts is approaching overbought levels, similar to what occurred in late-March, which preceded a pullback in price. On the daily chart, however, the RSI is neutral, which means buyers could remain active at support.  For now, BTC continues to hold support above $37,500 – a key level that has kept the recovery phase intact. Further, a series of higher price lows since Jan. 24 indicates a slowdown in selling pressure, albeit with 20% price swings.  Momentum signals on the weekly chart are still positive, which could point to additional upside toward the $46,710 resistance level over the intermediate term.

While this is going on, speculations abound as to why the network is now seeing this rate of accelerated growth compared to when the market was still in a bull trend.

53430,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=232272,1650407456,Could Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge Rollups Transform and Improve Network Performance?,"Due to its popularity and the number of decentralized apps (dApps), Ethereum has experienced network congestion. This move has limited scalability, high fees, and slow transactions. Layer 2 (L2) protocols, which are platforms that operate on top of the underlying blockchain, have been one answer to these challenges. One sort of L2 solution is zero-knowledge rollups, which are aimed to provide improved transaction speeds and cheap costs. The other top solution is optimistic rollups parallel to the main Ethereum chain on layer 2. This feature can improve the scalability of the network by not requiring any computation. Instead, after a transaction, it will propose a new state to Mainnet. The main issue with Ethereum is how developers and users will choose the most advanced technology for their app. Convenience usually wins unless the technology is better. This article will discuss how optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups transform and improve network performance. Let&apos;s dive in: What are Rollups? A rollup is an Ethereum-based scaling solution that allows users to perform transactions outside the network&apos;s Layer 1. It will enable the key to maintain its security while scaling the network. Because just a portion of the data from rollup transactions must fit within Ethereum blocks, moving transaction execution off-chain enables a more significant number of transactions to be executed.

With the 60-day public comment period coming to an end on May 11, the U.S. regulator will invite representatives of the company and others who have a stake in the decision to a public roundtable, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the event hasn’t yet been announced. The open discussion will invite public commentary from proponents and critics without carrying the force of a hearing.  CFTC spokesman Steven Adamske declined to comment on the plan, and an FTX official couldn't be reached for comment.  Chairman Rostin Behnam has said his agency is taking a cautious approach to the application from FTX.US to allow its trading platform to directly clear derivatives that are backed by margin. He suggested the application could be the first of many, and if approved could have major implications. The industry, though, has been optimistic about the tone Benham struck at a recent congressional hearing.  “This proposal could end up leading to more efficient trading execution, less risk in the system,” Behnam told lawmakers last month at the House Agriculture Committee, adding that he’s required to foster “responsible innovation” and FTX’s idea wouldn’t seem to violate commodities laws.  The CFTC held more than two dozen roundtables when it was trying to establish an array of new rules after the Dodd-Frank Act sought to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. This time, the agency is weighing the key crypto matter with a new slate of commissioners – four members having been sworn in during March and April after recent Senate confirmations.  The agency has already received dozens of comment letters, such as one from the founders of BlockTower Capital, which argued that FTX’s idea “will reduce the over-reliance on the current gatekeepers to trading markets.” The comment period, however, runs for three more weeks, and the proposal is expected to have critics among more established exchanges.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/19/ftx-plan-said-to-face-cftc-roundtable-next-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abaf7f7633db6ca77911d696ceeb269d31ff9c43-3936x2624.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, payments are just the beginning, and there are many more trade-fi verticals to be conquered in the future. Smart contracts, notably on Ethereum, have opened up a whole new world of decentralized finance, enabling crypto users to access various financial service verticals directly on-chain, in a permissionless and trustless manner, the same way Bitcoin payments are processed. Despite the fact that other chains may have gained the lead in DeFi development, the Bitcoin community has not rested on its laurels and has continued to push forward with the implementation of DeFi dApps on the blockchain. We dug deep into this emerging ecosystem, and here are some significant findings that not many might be aware of. Bitcoin dApps are being implemented on the second layer Peer-to-peer payments have been the sole focus of the Bitcoin network since its creation.

This is because so many factors can influence it. Indeed, the environmental impact of Bitcoin is hard to quantify. Moreover, many of the concerns are exaggerated, based on faulty assumptions and misunderstandings of the protocol&apos;s operation. If you are a Bitcoiner, you most likely feel the same way about the Bitcoin protocol. Exaggerated Power Consumption of The Bitcoin Protocol The power consumption of the Bitcoin protocol is vast. Still, it is comparable to the energy consumption of about a dozen utility-scale nuclear reactors in the U.S., which provides 20 percent of its electricity. While the amount of energy bitcoin uses is small in comparison to large countries, the energy used by this digital currency is a significant source of carbon emissions. Bitcoin users also expend large amounts of energy and computing power to create the &apos;blockchain&apos; of bitcoin transactions. It is impossible to quantify the exact amount of energy used by the Bitcoin protocol. However, its estimated power usage is comparable to other industrialized financial systems. Bitcoin&apos;s energy consumption is not as high as some economists believe. However, the value of its cryptocurrency investment is a good indicator of its environmental impact.

Most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperformed bitcoin, suggesting a greater appetite for risk among traders. For example, THORChain's RUNE token rallied by 11% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 2% rise in BTC over the same period. Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens such as AAVE and EOS rose more than 7% on Tuesday.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Sentiment is also starting to improve among crypto traders, evidenced by a slight uptick in the bitcoin Fear & Greed Index on Tuesday. Still, some buyers remain on the sidelines as BTC trades in a tight range between $32,000 and $46,000.  Stocks were also higher on Tuesday as the 10-year Treasury yield rose toward 2.9%, a level not seen since late 2018. Gold, a traditional safe haven asset, traded lower over the past 24 hours, indicating a slight risk-on tone in global markets.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $41322, +1.25%    ●Ether (ETH): $3098, +2.75%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4462, +1.61%    ●Gold: $1950 per troy ounce, −1.67%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.91%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin's value zone  A large amount of bitcoin supply has been accumulated between the $38,000 and $45,000 price range, according to blockchain data compiled by Glassnode. Typically, price ""value"" zones, areas with a large amount of trading activity, precede strong breakouts or breakdowns in price.  ""Despite an additional two months of sideways consolidation, a large proportion of the market appears unwilling to spend and sell their coins, even if their coins are held at a loss,"" Glassnode wrote in a blog post. That suggests price-insensitive traders hold much of bitcoin's supply above the $40,000 price level.  So far, long-term price momentum has deteriorated, so it remains to be seen if traders will continue to find attractive buying points between $35,000 and $42,000. From a technical perspective, a breakout or breakdown of the current price range is needed to confirm a shift in trend.  The chart below shows a volume profile of bitcoin's year-long price range. Currently, the midpoint indicates short-term support at $38,590. High-volume nodes around $32,000 and $50,000 define the most recent price range, which typically coincides with prolonged periods of accumulation or distribution.  The recent decline in buy volume relative to sell volume, however, could indicate a lack of conviction among bitcoin buyers. If a breakdown of the current range occurs, secondary support is seen at $27,000 and $23,500.  Altcoin roundup  Terra’s LUNA surges 11% as UST becomes third-largest stablecoin: Terra’s LUNA outperformed the wider crypto market, rising by as much as 11% over the past 24 hours.

42394227,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaTOl,1650395623,Elon Musk Shouldn't Lead Twitter,"Elon Musk, the climate activist, space entrepreneur and maker of electric vehicles, is apparently in a bidding war for Twitter (TWTR). My advice: Walk away.  Last month, Musk purchased about 10% of the microblogging company’s free-floating stock, making him the largest shareholder, according to a securities filing. What followed hasn’t been exactly clear: Twitter, the company, offered him a place on the board but also took steps to limit his power and instituted a “poison pill” that would dilute everyone’s shares and prevent a “hostile takeover.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It’s not clear why a man that already has Twitter’s influence would want to own it. As part of his campaign to win popular favor over the platform, Musk has put forward a number of apparent improvements he’d like to see. Like any good populist, Musk wants to give Twitter denizens what they think they want: an edit button, longer tweets, DOGE tipping (although, admittedly, the audience for DOGE improvements might be small).  Crypto, to the extent that there’s any such coherent cohort, has both a dog in the race and a perspective. Twitter is absolutely invaluable to the industry, as it is to other niche interests. Over and above other social or communicative platforms, Twitter is where news breaks, where reputations are made (and lost) and where coins go to market. There are other centralized platforms in crypto’s comms stack – Discord, Slack, even Gmail – but the “bird app” flies above.  See also: It's Time to Talk About Crypto Twitter | Opinion  Musk, at one time the wealthiest man on record, could do much to bolster the platform. Twitter is everyone’s megaphone – it has spurred revolutions, fostered social movements and, most recently, may have changed the course of a war. It’s quite seriously a world-historical medium, with its own emergent genre and, very frequently, genuinely fun. But, like anywhere else large groups meet and continually interact, Twitter can be nasty and brutish – and not just because the posting format is so short.  Crypto scams  Twitter is inundated with spam. Sadly, much of this foul talk comes from crypto. Any major player in the “digital assets industry” will have their dedicated following of bots that post sometimes hundreds of messages under every tweet they cast. Some scammers have the gaul to impersonate you. It’s a problem that has spread beyond crypto to other popular figures. Scroll through the replies to any “viral” tweet and you’ll find scam links and phishing schemes, the worst “advertisements” for the worst coins.  Once, a Canadian videographer Dan Olson who recently locked-in a reputation as a smart crypto skeptic with his hour-long “documentary,” “Line Goes Up,” subtweeted a review I published here, dear “The Node” reader, only to find his suspicions confirmed that what crypto calls “a community” is just an army of shills and bots. It was a bad look. Of the thousands of replies to Olson, he suspected only 10 were “actual humans.” And that’s being “generous,” he said.  “I haven't felt the need to reply to much of anything because the crypto ecosystem's reality speaks for itself,” Olson wrote.  Add to this the nefarious campaign that other crypto critics Bennett Tomlin and “Cas Piancey” are astudiously documenting where crypto shills buyout or take over large Twitter accounts (>100,000 followers) to advertise their projects. For the inattentive, simply having a large Twitter account tweet platitudes about “Floki Coin” or “Floki Doge Coin” or “Dick Butt Coin” can imbue those fly-by-night rug-pulls with air of distinction and importance.  This trend literally rose to the level of the White House a few years back when a ne’er-do-well teenager took over the Twitter accounts of multiple celebrities, politicians and even this media company to post a classic giveaway scam. “I am giving back to my fans. All Bitcoin sent to my address below will be sent back doubled,” the Florida hacker wrote, on his way to racking up 30 felony charges.  Not all scams are criminal offenses (though they may offend other sensibilities), which might be part of the reason Twitter has had such a difficult go at cracking down on this activity. And, being fair, it’s not just crypto implicated here but also other quasi-Ponzis like multilevel marketing (MLM) and pyramid schemes. Give people an open platform and they’ll probably use it to extort others.  Of all the things Musk fanboys are hoping he does if/when he takes over as Big Boss of Twitter could win big simply by cleaning Twitter of this mess. Banish the bots, maybe the blue checks.  Open platforms  Apparently motivating Musk is a sense that Twitter has gone astray as a public communications platform – it reneged on its promise to be the “free speech wing of the free speech party.” The company, like all other social media firms, currently keeps its algorithms in a black box. It’s also not exactly forthcoming or consistent with explanations for banning accounts. This is to ask, why certain voices are banished and others boosted?  Before it came to light that Musk bought a large portion of Twitter, he raised the possibility of creating an alternative social media platform. It’s telling that he didn’t.  Put simply, there is no alternative to Twitter: People use the social platforms where the most popular and influential figures gather because they want a shot of actually influencing “the discourse” or watching as it unfolds. Platforms like Mastodon and even the Donald Trump-backed “Truth” have historically struggled to gain an audience – and often result in echo chambers of opinion.  Crypto, too, has largely failed at creating a viable alternative. Many people are put off by the idea that their posts will truly live forever on a blockchain and may resent that all of their interactions are monetized (even if just through microtransactions).  See also: Why Everyone Wants an Invite to Clubhouse Crypto  Musk might also follow through on former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s “Blue Sky” dream to open up the protocol’s algorithm. This would allow people to write their own front-end websites on top of Twitter and customize their content feeds.  He might also defend existing laws like Section 230 that ensure platforms remain open by shielding them from responsibility for what users post. Without such a protection, companies would certainly “censor” even more dissent or dangerous voices if they faced the threat of more lawsuits. Arguably, open protocols do in practice what the Communications and Decency Act does in theory: create spaces where all are free to post, and remove central arbiters from having to make content decisions (though Twitter is still free to “censor” because that form of political speech is protected by the First Amendment).  It’s all the more important to have these laws that stand for generations considering that, though dominant now, there’s nothing inherent in Twitter that means it will stave off competition forever.  Musk ain’t the man  There are clear moves Musk could make if he ran Twitter to make it a better experience, many deeply involved with the crypto industry. But I reiterate the call that he shouldn’t. Without giving credence to conspiracies that the real power brokers of America in finance, media and government are working together to block his ascent, it’s enough to say that Twitter’s problems are its own making and it will take a community – not an individual – to fix.  Last week, ex-Reddit CEO ​​Yishan Wong weighed in on the Musk-Twitter story with the sage wisdom only a former executive of a modern-day communications giant could offer. He, too, said Musk should avoid the headache, and put forward the common-sense view that for-profit companies like Twitter and Facebook (now Meta) only “censor” as far as their bottom line is concerned.  Instead, they feel compelled to act, to moderate public debate, because “ideas really can – at certain times and places – become lightning rods for actual, physical, kinetic mob behavior,” Wong said. Perhaps this is blaming the victims, but it seems incontrovertible that when groups of people are forced to interact, often coming into a conversation midway with little context, will jump to conclusions and turn speech into weapons.  Wong said Twitter users should instead feel responsible for the platform from which they derive so much value and just be civil. Musk – who has been sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for market manipulation related to his tweets and who, in turn, asked at times that agency put on their “reasonableness pants” and, though deniable, perform fellatio on him – is not the man for the job.  Musk craves popularity, controversy and seems incapable of helping himself. Worse, his political commitments are variable (like most business-minded individuals, he uses or abuses governments often over Twitter based on what he perceives to benefit him). He seems willing to take sides, contrarian that he is, often against whatever is the “current thing.”  Instead, we Twitter users should use this moment to reflect and improve our behavior. Crypto, the source of so many of Twitter’s problems, also provides a blueprint by advocating for permissionless protocols. There’s a convincing argument that it be turned over to the people either as a public utility or through what Nathan Schneider calls “exit to community,” where stockholders sell their influence to the public.

Bitcoin SOPR Still Some Distance Above The &apos;One&apos; Level As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC SOPR hints there may be some ways to go still before a bottom forms. The &apos;spent output profit ratio&apos; (or SOPR in brief) is an indicator that tells us whether investors are selling at a profit or a loss right now. The metric works by evaluating the history of each coin on the chain to see which price it was last moved at. If this price was less than the current price (that is, the selling price), then the coin sold at a profit. On the other hand, the last price being more than the current one would imply the investor realized a loss on this coin.

It was a simple tennis game and won plaudits at the Brookhaven National Laboratory&apos;s open house. Higginbottom&apos;s game slowly morphed into a number of other games, and the video-gaming industry started booming. Virtual gaming started in the 1960s with games such as Spacewar, which focused on solo gameplay. However, by the 1970s, the trend shifted towards the incorporation of a social component to the competitive experience of gaming, fuelled by the explosion of arcade gaming. Arcade gaming was instrumental in that it allowed players competing for bragging rights at the same game to do so in the same setting. Virtual games thus built on this popularity, evolving to enable players to interact with each other primarily through competition and collaboration. This new level of interaction inevitably attracted more gamers, and developers started embedding multiplayer game logic at the core of their products. The Dawn of P2E In 1984 the Islands of Kesmai, allowing up to 100 people to play simultaneously, was released, paving the way for multiplayer-driven virtual games. The collapsing prices of computer networking in the 1990s and the increasing adoption of personal computers further accelerated the prevalence of multiplayer-driven virtual games.

42395533,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxbyS,1650394049,DeFi Developer Andre Cronje Teases New Regulation-Focused Crypto Projects,"Prolific decentralized finance (DeFi) developer Andre Cronje appears to be back in crypto after abruptly quitting the industry last month.  Before DeFi degens rejoice, Cronje says he’s not interested in pioneering new tokenomic models or launching triple-digit yield farms. Instead, he’s set his sights on a tamer area – regulated crypto.  In a blog post published Tuesday, Cronje announced that he and his unnamed collaborators were working on several projects focused on crypto compliance and regulation. The list includes areas such as compliant custody products, risk reporting and state-supported national blockchains.  “Instead of trying to fight regulatory bodies because of crypto regulation, we should be trying to engage and educate on regulated crypto,” wrote Cronje, who added that on-boarding institutions would be one of his main goals.  Degen to defender  Cronje’s new focus is a far cry from his previous DeFi projects, which include platforms such as Solidly and Yearn Finance, among dozens of others.  While his projects are deployed across several different layer-1 blockchains, Cronje had a reputation for building protocols that allowed DeFi participants to take greater risks for higher yield and introducing complex tokenomic models.  On March 6, Cronje’s collaborator Anton Nell tweeted that the pair would be “closing the chapter of contributing to the defi/crypto space,” an announcement that sent the tokens of several DeFi protocols tumbling.  Since then, Cronje has stayed out of the limelight, leading many to speculate whether he would ever return to crypto.  Cronje’s new interest in regulation appears to reflect his new (and less idealistic) outlook on the entire industry.  In a previous blog post published on Monday – his first since going on hiatus – Cronje unleashed veiled criticism of the DeFi market, saying crypto was “repeating” the mistakes of previous monetary policymakers.  “I often feel that a lot of what is being built in crypto is being built by people that read a Wikipedia article on bonds, or seigniorage, or debt instruments and then thought to themselves, ‘they can do this better,’” Cronje wrote.  The DeFi movement began with a group of high-minded crypto developers who wanted to create a new, trustless financial system that solved many of the problems they saw in the legacy financial system.  Now, Cronje is not so sure crypto can build it better, saying the complexities of monetary policy “exist for a reason.” He also cited disdain for crypto culture’s focus on greed and ego, as the DeFi sector in the past two years minted a new class of crypto wealth.  Cronje, ironically himself one of the most prolific builders in crypto, appears to have learned this lesson, writing, “There is an irony in having come full circle.”  Crypto regulation vs. regulated crypto  The solution, Cronje concluded, is greater regulation “not as a mechanism to prevent, but as a mechanism to protect.”  In his Tuesday post, Cronje called crypto regulation “simply infeasible,” calling out public blockchains as having no domain, and therefore “should be guided by Maritime Law.”  Cronje, however, called regulated crypto (which includes entities such as exchanges, publicly listed crypto funds and other infrastructure components of the legacy financial system) “very feasible.”  The shift toward greater compliance in the DeFi market also comes as crypto exchange Uniswap battles a class-action lawsuit and the sector continues to be beset by nine-figure hacks with alarming frequency.  “It’s like a child trying to stick their finger into an electric outlet; you stop them, before they can learn why they shouldn’t,” Cronje wrote. “One day they will understand, but not today.”  Cronje didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | UNI | YFI,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/19/defi-developer-andre-cronje-teases-new-regulation-focused-crypto-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a165b605041ce4513f0bae8eaab8d4fd22b8771-2238x1428.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The first crypto by market cap managed to trace back its weekend losses and returned to the $40,000 area.

The general sentiment in the market seems optimistic as BTC&apos;s price was able to push back the bears&apos; fresh assault and prevent further losses. The $38,000 to $39,000 area was full of bid orders, as NewsBTC reported yesterday, which proved a critical zone for the rebound. The current price action seems to be trending upwards in volatility after a long period of stagnation for BTC&apos;s price. As seen below, data from Arcane Research indicates that low volatility levels could be brewing Bitcoin for a fresh rally or a reclaim of its previous highs. The research firm noted that Bitcoin&apos;s 30-day volatility reached a multi-year low. The last time this metric stood at its current levels was in November 2020. At that time, Bitcoin broke out of its bear market price action from the $3,000 to $16,000 range and into uncharted territory. The decrease in volatility seems to have hinted at this price movement and could potentially be indicative of BTC&apos;s future performance as it rebounds back to $40,000.

Across the industry, crypto funds had $97 million in net outflows in the seven days through Apr. 15, according to CoinShares. Of that, 88% came from European funds in a shift from the prior week when the majority of the $134 million in outflows came from U.S. funds. The $134 million in outflows was the most since January.  “We have witnessed bitcoin becoming increasingly interest-rate ‘sensitive’ over the course of 2022 in a similar way to other stores of value,"" CoinShares wrote in its report.  So-called ""short"" bitcoin investment products – such as exchange-traded products that provide an inverse to the cryptocurrency's performance – saw $1.8 million in outflows last week after a few weeks of inflows.  Bitcoin-related products saw outflows of $73 million, claiming the majority of the outflows. Trading volume of bitcoin funds was at half of the yearly average at $651 million, echoing the shrinking overall bitcoin trading volume. It was 32% off the year’s weekly average.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has traded at around $40,000 since early April. It went up to over $41,000 on Apr. 13, but fell back to $40,000 later in the week.  Funds focused on ethereum (ETH) saw $27 million in outflows, more than the previous week’s $15.3 million in outflows.

The letter, seen by CoinDesk and signed by academics, lobby groups and senior executives from companies such as Ledger, Aave and Blockchain.com, says current proposals to identify crypto users, known as the travel rule, endanger privacy and innovation in the EU.  “The proposals from the European Parliament, by leading to the public disclosure of all transactions and digital asset wallet addresses, will put every digital asset owner at risk” and “risk derailing years of preparatory work and the future of Web 3” in Europe, said the letter, dated April 13.  The laws were first proposed by the European Commission in July 2021 to implement standards set by global regulator the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which noted in a report that many jurisdictions still haven't applied. But lawmakers and governments have since added extra constraints, removing a threshold of 1,000 euros ($1,080) under which transaction participants wouldn’t need to be named.  With respect to a separate law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), the letter also calls for lawmakers and governments to exempt decentralized organizations and algorithmic stablecoins from regulatory obligations, and to return to FATF’s original plans for the travel rule.  The draft anti-money laundering laws were passed by lawmakers in a March 31 vote, after regulators warned that even small crypto payments could be used to fund crimes such as terrorism and child pornography. But governments must agree on the final text before it passes into law.

In what was termed the second-largest Defi attack, the hackers stole about 120,000ETH, valued at over $320 million. Defi hacking is one of the biggest problems facing the Defi space, with projects losing millions and billions to such attacks. It is when criminals take advantage of smart contracts to steal funds. The most basic definition of hacking is when an individual looks for breaches in digital devices, exploiting the network&apos;s weaknesses. The attackers may manipulate the smart contracts into committing errors that benefit them. In general, hacking takes different forms, thus giving the different types of Defi hacks. Let&apos;s look at the types of these hacks and their frequency. Flashloan Attack One of the major types of Defi hacks is flashloan attacks, which mainly occur on Defi lending platforms. A flashloan is a type of uncollateralized loan in Defi lending, which must be paid in the same transaction as the borrow transaction. It requires no checks or limits. However, hackers may try to take advantage of these flashloan attacks to benefit. In such hacks, the attacker takes a flashloan but uses various tricks so that they make a short, quick and profitable transaction. As a type of hack, flashloan attacks involve multiple applications, hence are complex to carry out.

NFTs are social media tools that solve a common problem-&apos;secondary sales.&apos; Artists and content creators can now monetize their audience in traditional ways. For example, artists such as Beeple and 3LAU are developing new business models to help NFT owners generate income from their content. Moreover, musicians like Kings of Leon have monetized their fans through traditional methods. Entrepreneurs such as Tom Bilyeu, host of the popular Impact Theory podcast, are developing new ways to benefit from NFTs. NFTs Are A New Way To Monetize Digital Artworks The newest trend in monetization is NFTs or networked tokens. It allows artists to sell their digital artworks directly from their creators. This makes it easy to distribute and store them without needing a physical asset. Hence, making NFTs a great way to promote art. The concept behind NFTs is that the art assets traded on the NFT network are verified using blockchain technology. This records transactions and provides proof of ownership to buyers. The digital art world is experiencing a booming market for digital assets. NFTs enable artists, influencers, and sports franchises to monetize these products easily.

42421198,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIhh,1650382874,Sara Baumann: NFTs Let Me Quit My Job,"One day in September, while working full-time as an occupational therapist at a hospital in Texas, Sara Baumann was in a patient’s room when her Apple watch started pinging like crazy.  “Of course, you can’t scroll through an Apple Watch very quickly to gather information,” she says. So she went downstairs and called her husband to ask what was happening. He picked up the phone and started crying.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  “Sara, Gary [Vaynerchuck] just bought all three of your art pieces,” Baumann recalls him saying. The rest of her genesis non-fungible token (NFT) collection, 10 paintings of women carrying weapons ranging from grenades to flamethrowers, then sold out in 45 seconds.  Baumann immediately asked whether she could quit her job – she cared deeply about her patients and colleagues, but art was her passion, and she’d always dreamed of doing it full-time. Her husband advised her to wait. Still, realizing that now was her time to “capitalize on the momentum,” Baumann put her head down and started working hard on her next NFT collection, one that she calls more “purpose-built for the space.”  That collection became Women and Weapons, a 10,000-piece profile picture project (PFP) featuring women with various skin tones, human-powered weapons (like boxing wraps and nunchucks), and nods to famous women from history, like Queen Isabella of Spain and Hurrem, the Ottoman Sultan’s wife who led with her husband in “almost equal caliber.” She drew all the women by hand, then used an algorithm to mismash their various traits to generate each unique image.  After about a six weeks of working nine- to 10-hour hospital shifts, then coming home to draw for an additional five hours, Baumann finally minted Women and Weapons in October 2021. They sold out in under four hours.  “The rest has kind of been history,” she says. Cliché, but true – Baumann was finally able to leave her hospital job in January, and has become the driving artistic voice of a community centered on questioning the double standards between men and women through jarring, lively portraits of women who boldly look viewers in the eye, challenging them with protruding tongues or hands full of ninja stars.  “People might pass a movie poster of a man holding a weapon and think nothing of it,” Baumann says. “Why is it that as soon as you're seeing a woman holding a weapon you have an issue with it?”  Read more: Jeff Wilser - How ‘World of Women’ Became a Celebrity NFT Phenom  These double standards apply in the NFT industry, where a notorious 2021 Art Tactic report showed women artists accounted for just 5% of NFT art sales. Baumann spoke with CoinDesk about how she hopes to challenge this status quo with her collection, the disturbing 1940s advertisements that inspired her work and how she’s using Women and Weapons to provide a non-violent “weapon” for women – education.  Before Women and Weapons, you painted your smaller genesis collection – but that was before you got into NFTs. How did you initially try and sell them?  It was mostly through Etsy. I tried to start my own website on, I think, Shopify, and was trying to market myself on Facebook and Instagram. It would be a post in the morning before I went to work and then a post in the evening, whenever I would get home. That's all I had time to do. My husband, recognizing that the collection meant a lot to me, urged me to mint my artwork as NFTs. It took a lot of time for me to research and really understand the space, especially given that I didn't have a ton of time to be researching.  I saw the tweet about you getting your big break from Gary Vaynerchuck. How did that happen?  Occasionally on Saturdays, he will post that he's looking for a new one-of-one artist to collect from. In my case, he had posted that he was looking for one-of-one artists who had unsold pieces to collect. I posted in his comments, “I'd love for you to be my first collector.” I attached some of my images in my link.  So he really helped launch your career in NFTs.  He not only helped me out, but is also helping a lot of other women as well. Not just artists, but also female businesspeople. For example, he has Avery Akkineni, who's the president of VaynerNFT. She’s the most incredible woman on planet Earth. He's been very supportive of a lot of women getting into Web 3, educating them, making sure that they have the opportunity to have high visibility roles.  There's that statistic going around about how 5% of art sales in the NFT space go to women artists. When you saw that were you surprised? Or were you more like, this makes sense based on what I've seen?  I think a little bit of both – a little bit of surprise, in that I didn’t anticipate the number would be so low. At the same time, I was, like, OK, this is fuel, let's go. This statistic is making me recognize there's a need for female representation in the space, but also a need for increased education about the space. In early to mid-2021 it was very much a boys’ club. A lot of women did feel very excluded.  We're still trying to achieve pay equality, and equality regarding female leaders in business, tech, law – so many different areas. The Web 3 space is such a brand-new frontier. We need to bring as many women as we possibly can in so that they don't miss this opportunity. Seeing what it did for me – the fact that I'm able to achieve my dreams of being a full-time artist – I want to invite women in not just to buy NFTs, not just to start their own NFT project, but to execute whatever superpower they have in Web 3 so that they can have a sustainable career and achieve financial independence.  What made you ultimately quit the hospital to go into Women and Weapons full-time?  First, I continued trying to work in the hospital at a PRN status, which essentially means as needed. I was working one to two days, usually weekends, until about January. My last day going into the hospital, I recognized that the whole time I was there I was thinking, ‘I have so much to do, I have so many emails to get back to, I've so many things that I need to accomplish.’  Of course, having a Middle Eastern mother, she was very much like, [putting on her mother’s accent] ‘Sara, you better not quit your job, you don't know how long this lasts.’ After enough months of working PRN and her recognizing that Women and Weapons really needed me full-time, she goes, [accent again] ‘Sara, I think you need to quit your job and maybe do Women and Weapons full-time.’ Wow, OK. Finally I get the green light from my mother.  In designing the collection, how did you come up with the women’s different traits?  First, I will say that designing an NFT collection is no easy feat. You have to make sure that everything matches up. But one of the things I wanted to encapsulate in the traits was having as much representation as possible, given that there are constraints in a generative collection. I was inspired by my manager, Carolyn, who has vitiligo, a skin condition that removes the pigmentation from your skin.  I created the Carolyn body, which represents women with vitiligo. I tried to represent a variety of hairstyles, hair textures, hair colors, skin colors, eye colors and I also wanted to choose names for the body traits that represented notable women throughout history. Not all of them are that – I have one named Lavenza, which is Frankenstein's wife.  I also wanted to choose weaponry that required manual power. We have a lot of brass knuckles, boxers’ wraps, nunchucks. It’s not firepower – it's more about the strength in the individual. That's what powers the weapon.  But your genesis collection has firepower.  Yes, yes. I wanted to choose weapons from different time periods – like the 1940s era. When women went into the workforce, it was surrounding the war.  My very first piece is the woman holding the grenade with the flowers coming out of it. I saw many ads from the 1940s and 1950s that put women down. There’s one shoe ad with a woman lying next to the shoes, and it says, ‘Keep her where she belongs.’ They're honestly super-upsetting, and a big part of why I wanted to portray women as powerful during that era. There's another ad of a man spanking his wife – he has her over his lap on a chair – and he's spanking her because she bought the wrong brand of coffee. I wanted to portray a woman of that advertising era holding that grenade in an almost satirical manner, but also removing the violence from it by adding the flowers. She's the one that really sparked my flame.  Do you get people who take issue with the possibility that your collection is promoting violence?  Art is meant to elicit a response. Would people have stopped and had a conversation or probed if it was a woman with cotton candy in her hand? Probably not. A big reason why I created the collection was to start conversations around equity, representation and double standards. I'm doing that by having something jarring. People often message me asking, ‘Why Women and Weapons, why not respect and equality?’ To which I answer them, ‘This is why. I want the opportunity to have this kind of a conversation with you.’  How did you choose which charity to donate 5% of your initial and secondary Women and Weapons sales to?  Sustainable change is important for me – so is the recognition that for a woman, education can be her weapon, especially in underserved nations where women often don't have that opportunity. Even gaining a semblance of an education can increase the likelihood for a woman to gain independence and begin her own career, which is part of why I chose the Malala Fund. She’s opening doors for women and children around the world to have that opportunity to go to school.  Do you have a favorite weapon that you chose to depict in the collection?  It’s not necessarily akin to Persian daggers, but the gold daggers are probably the closest to Persian daggers that I could get. Obviously, I'm Iranian. I love anything that's gold, so the gold weapons are my favorite. But the golden daggers are my absolute favorite, and I think that's heavily because of my cultural appreciation. If you look at some of the Ottoman daggers, they're very ornate and very beautiful. Not only were they used for power and status, but they were also art pieces.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/19/sara-baumann-nfts-let-me-quit-my-job,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa89eccc2bd43f6e940d5e3daf1712c14d662de2-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42395531,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxbxT,1650382752,"Framework Ventures Launches $400M Fund to Back Web 3 Gaming, DeFi","Crypto investment firm Framework Ventures has reached $1.4 billion in total assets under management after securing $400 million for its third venture capital fund. Half of the capital will go toward blockchain gaming investments with Web 3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) as secondary areas of interest.  After emerging as one of the primary beneficiaries of 2020’s “DeFi Summer,” Framework’s new focus on blockchain gaming is notable.  “We think Web 3 gaming is the sector that has the most potential for growth within the wider blockchain industry,” Framework co-founder Michael Anderson told CoinDesk in a statement.  Framework initially focused on DeFi because when the first fund launched in 2019, financial solutions had the best product-market fit for blockchains, Anderson told CoinDesk in an interview. However, subsequent innovations in layer 2 and non-Ethereum blockchains have shifted crypto excitement toward blockchain gaming.  “[Gaming] has that same sort of Spidey-sense feeling where it feels like gaming is really about to take off based on the amount of energy, people focused on it and just the infrastructure that’s enabling it,” he said.  The Framework motto is “go where the entrepreneurs go,” Anderson added, and he sees entrepreneurs increasingly heading into the gaming space.  That said, gamers have so far proved to be stiff competition for crypto adherents, railing against non-fungible token (NFT) plans from some of the industry’s top studios.

The digital asset pullback at the beginning of 2022 hasn’t dulled the hunger for new funds. Sequoia Capital and Bain Capital each recently committed nearly $600 million to crypto investments.  Framework was founded in 2019 by former Snapchat project manager Anderson and Vance Spencer, who handled business operations for Netflix in Japan. Capital for Framework funds largely comes from a small set of institutional investors.  Framework was an early DeFi advocate and has invested in the likes of oracle network Chainlink, liquidity protocol Aave, data indexing protocol The Graph and liquidity provider Tokenmak. Framework isn’t new to the blockchain gaming space, having previously backed play-to-earn game developer Illuvium.  “Founders understand our cultural influence in the space because our affiliate, Framework Labs, has spent the last three years building alongside them, running nodes, participating in on-chain governance, building tools, staking and more,” said Spencer in the press release. “We believe we’re well-positioned to outperform our competitors, including the Sand Hill set that is only now coming into crypto and Web 3.”  UPDATE (April 19, 17:09 UTC): Adds quotes from interview with Framework co-founder Michael Anderson.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LINK | SPONSORED,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/19/framework-ventures-launches-400m-fund-to-back-gaming-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b135d1bd6e8eb4b0cd88dfa19f2bfc75477bf93-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We want to help users unlock more liquidity and better leverage their assets without having to exit their positions.”  Hedge offers interest-free loans that provide users with instant liquidity without creating a taxable event with ongoing interest payments. Users can deposit and borrow against their Solana (SOL) tokens, and Hedge provides the loans in USH, its dollar-pegged stablecoin.

That means that citizens of crisis-hit countries like Greece and Argentina could potentially see their access to bitcoin limited alongside restrictions on withdrawing cash from ATMs or accessing foreign currency.  “Laws and regulations for foreign exchange and capital flow management measures should be reviewed and amended if necessary to cover crypto assets,"" even if currencies like bitcoin don't formally count as financial assets or foreign currency, the IMF said in a financial stability report published Tuesday.  “The war in Ukraine has brought to the forefront some of the challenges that regulators face in terms of applying sanctions and capital flow management measures,” it added, citing the risk that crypto-based evasion will become “more widespread.”  Though the IMF concedes that making big ruble transfers on crypto exchanges is “impractical,"" it warns some of those seeking to evade sanctions may turn to less scrupulous providers or use other privacy techniques like mixers.  Crypto mining also offers the chance for emerging market countries to effectively exchange energy for bitcoin, the IMF said, adding to concerns that states' ability to halt outflows during financial turbulence could be undermined.  In remarks to reporters after the publication of the report, IMF officials admitted virtual assets probably aren't being used to circumvent the financial restrictions on Russia.  “The evidence to date suggests there is not much going on in terms of undermining sanctions via crypto assets,” said Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets department, citing data on prices and volumes of Tether stablecoin transactions. “Of course it’s something that we’re watching very very closely.""  The report follows an IMF warning in October that underregulated crypto could cause instability and fraud. Central bankers such as European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde have previously said that crypto is being used to evade financial sanctions imposed on Russia, despite little evidence.

Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Delta One has raised a $9.1 million seed round led by Alameda Research and DeFi developer collective Ship Capital. The funding will go toward the protocol’s core development and ecosystem expansion.  The Delta One protocol offers users an automated, low-risk way to earn yield by using a ""delta neutral"" trading strategy that reduces volatility.  ""You have this market neutral exposure, so you can ‘set and forget’ your position. You don’t need to worry about ‘Oh, the price is constantly changing.’ It’s not really reflecting the price too much,” Delta One co-founder Paul Sengh told CoinDesk in an interview.  Other participants in the funding round included Solana Ventures, Solana co-founder Raj Gokal, investment firms Electric Capital and AlleyCorp and Race Capital co-founders Chris McCann and Alfred Chuang.  Delta One was founded by Paul and DJ Sengh in October 2021 during the Solana Ignition Hackathon.  “Delta-neutral farming is a technique that many hedge funds love to use, but it can require spending hours each day crunching numbers and tracking positions when done manually by retail investors,” said DJ Sengh in the press release. “We believe democratizing these strategies through structured products will be a pivotal part of onboarding the next billion users of DeFi.”  Delta One is working to expand its ecosystem by partnering with projects that could build on the protocol’s vaults, which includes teams creating new lending markets, reserve currencies and novel options strategies.  Delta One is considering creating a stablecoin to help purchasers earn sustainable yield across the vaults without having to enter the site.

42394232,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaTjH,1650374573,The End of NFT Rug Pulls?,"“Scams” has become a synonym for NFTs lately.  With marketplaces overwhelmed by fraudulent projects, many collectors of non-fungible tokens have suffered from maybe the most notorious method of all, rug pulls, where the creators of a digital asset ditch the project and abscond with investors' funds.  An environment filled with FOMO (“fear of missing out”), inexperienced buyers and mischievous individuals trying to take advantage of them, has hurt the credibility of those who are trying to help this sector grow.  On April 10, out of nowhere, the team behind a play-to-earn game called “CryptoFighters Alliance” posted a thread on Twitter about a new token standard they created: ERC-721R. In just three days they managed to generate a lot of stir, receiving over 1,330 organic retweets and 3,000 likes, with a mix of praise and criticism.  Meanix is a 21-year-old self-described “all-out NFTs fanatic, halfway between blockchain and music.” He welcomes reader feedback on Twitter or Instagram.  The offer of a refund guaranteed by the ERC-721R standard could prove to be a new starting point for this market, offering greater security to buyers and greater legitimacy to creators.  But is it worth the hype? Let’s find out.  What is the CryptoFighters Alliance?  First, some context.  CryptoFighters Alliance was launched in 2018, before Web 3 became a thing, as the team boasts, but has flown under the radar since then. What looks to have been a poorly performing project, neglected by the team from 2018 until the middle of 2021, is now rising from the dead, reanimated by their newest invention: ERC-721R.  On their communication channels, the CryptoFighters team emphasize the fact that they’ve been around for many years now and have proof of their longevity. And people are buying it. But is their early year of release enough to give the project credibility or is this new standard just a marketing stunt? It’s hard to tell. With a clearly visible gap of a couple of years in their activity, one can argue that the team behind CryptoFighters was not involved enough.  Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean ERC-721R is not valuable. With the developer behind it fully doxxed and with some high-profile individuals such as NFT influencer Zeneca.eth praising the initiative, this could be a new beginning for CryptoFighters Alliance and the entire non-fungible token market.  Not everyone was impressed, however. The Twitter account known as Popeye, who has over 149,000 followers, claimed that ERC-721R “has so many fundamental flaws”.  With some trying to get their hands on as many ERC-721R NFTs as possible, FOMO-ing in on the idea that whoever uses this new standard first will become the alpha dog, scrutiny of the standard is warranted.  What are ERCs?  Before moving forward, for those of you who don’t know what ERCs are yet, here’s a quick summary.  ERC is an acronym for Ethereum Requests for Comments. ERCs are proposals made by the community of developers that build applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone can make a smart contract, but the ERCs have the purpose of increasing standardization, allowing predictable communication between the ecosystem’s applications.  Some of the most popular ERCs include ERC-20, the standard for powering fungible tokens that can be exchanged within the Ethereum network, and ERC-721, the standard for creating NFTs.  What is ERC-721R?  ERC-721R is the latest development on top of the ERC-721 standard for NFTs, one that incorporates the fee-saving capabilities of ERC-721A, its predecessor, as well as an additional security feature.  According to the standard’s official website, ERC-721R “adds trustless refunds to NFT smart contracts allowing minters to return the NFTs minted at a cost within a given refund period.” Supposedly this will prevent quick rug pulls, a common type of scam.  How does ERC-721R work?  ERC-721R is a template that contains a mechanism that locks the funds transferred to a smart contract for a fixed number of days, called the “refund period.” During that period, all minters – meaning the primary buyers who purchase NFTs directly from their creators – can get their money back, while the owner of the smart contract can’t withdraw any or most of the funds from the wallet.  On the surface, ERC-721R sounds like a dream for any NFT collector, but let’s go back to the fundamental flaws Popeye was talking about.  In the same tweet as the one mentioned before, Popeye underlined the possibility that some people might “max mint” and initiate a refund “the second they can’t sell their remaining tokens above floor price,” the lowest price for an item from a collection. In theory, this could prove to be incredibly harmful for numerous genuine projects early on, putting a lot more risk on the shoulders of entrepreneurs and artists.  On the other side of this argument, it needs to be mentioned that the smart contract owners can set the refund price lower than the mint price, which could lead to buyers not getting their full investment back anyway. This option would still give collectors a sense of stability and relief because, in the worst case scenario, they don’t lose it all, but it also protects genuine projects from flippers and potentially large unjustified refund rates.  Also, at the time of writing, ERC-721R is in beta testing, so the standard gives no option to the creators to withdraw any percentage of the funds from the smart contract during the refund period.  Nevertheless, according to ERC-721R’s GitHub code repository, the standard should see more complex implementations in the future, such as:  Vesting (the creator will be able to release a certain percentage of the funds in the smart contract each month)  Cliffs (10% of the funds released immediately for the creator and the rest released at a later date)  Advantages of ERC-721R for creators  As far as sellers are concerned, the main advantage of using ERC-721R would be the increased credibility, allowing them to build confidence in the market. Also, since the new standard guarantees that the creators take more responsibility, we might see potential buyers leaning towards ERC-721R projects more in the future.  The refund mechanism also creates a new dynamic while still active because the floor price of the collection is unlikely to fall below the minting price. Until the refund period ends, or a large number of the original holders sell their NFTs, no minter will choose to sell the token below mint price if the refund price is equal and guaranteed.  Finally, the redemption period and other features of the NFTs can be chosen independently by the creators. ERC-721R is just a template and, as mentioned earlier, you can follow it as written, or tweak it to your liking.  Advantages of ERC-721R for buyers  As a collector you can now get a refund within a given timeframe for the NFTs bought. So, for all buyers, ERC-721R should be the proof of security, offering a better protection against scams. It’s essentially a lifeline for anyone investing in this space.  You can still be lied to, though!  As @prishalness, a good friend of mine who’s also a developer, has pointed out to me, creators can claim they are using ERC-721R, but the smart contract developer could still implement a secondary withdrawal feature for example, one that bypasses the refund period protection.  For your safety, DYOR – do your own research – and dive deeper into the team’s background before jumping into any project.  ERC-721 standards comparison  With Prishalness' help, I created a chart to help readers understand the differences between ERC-721 standards easily and make more educated decisions when setting out to purchase NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.  Final thoughts  In its current state, ERC-721R seems to be a cool idea with potential to destroy a project, but it could be a tweak or two away from becoming industry standard.  As Elie Steinbock, the developer behind the ERC-721R standard, has said, “The reality is we have refunds in [Web 2], and it works great for businesses that use it […] Because [the] vast majority of people don’t request [a] refund”.  The market demands increased accountability on creators’ part and greater security for buyers. It looks like ERC-721R might turn out to benefit both creators, giving them credibility, and investors, giving them better protection. But only time will tell how effective the new standard will be against scammers and if creators will adopt it massively.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin bounce stalls, dollar breaks multi-decade bearish trend line.  Featured Story: The fast-growing popularity of the TerraUSD stablecoin comes with some risk.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research, VanEck  Tigran Gambaryan, vice president of global intelligence and investigations, Binance  Joshua Ellul, director, Centre for Distributed Ledger Technology  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  While bitcoin has held vital support, the cryptocurrency does not appear to be out of the woods yet, given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar.  The top cryptocurrency by market value traded near $40,700 at press time, having printed a high of $41,250 during the Asian trading hours. On Monday, buyers held the three-day chart 200-period moving average, staving off a major technical breakdown.  The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against majors, rose to 101 early today, refreshing two-year highs and taking the month-to-date gain to 2.5%. The global reserve currency has risen 12% since May 2021, marking its best stretch since its run-up in late 2014 through early 2015, per data provided by charting platform TradingView.  The DXY may see further gains, as the monthly chart shows the two-decade bearish trendline has been breached to the upside.  ""We’ve been warning that USD strength is one of the biggest headwinds for markets, including BTC and crypto. As BTC struggles to keep its head above $40K, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) just broke 100 for the first time in almost two years,"" analysts at Delphi Digital wrote in a note published Monday. ""The greenback is now on the verge of a multi-decade breakout as two of its major currency pairs (EUR and JPY) are both vulnerable of technical breakdowns of their own. The EUR and JPY make up ~70% of the DXY index.""  ""Looking back over the last 10 years, we can see how BTC’s price tends to trend in the opposite direction of DXY momentum. In other words, when the dollar is gaining momentum, BTC underperforms (and vice versa),"" Delphi's analysts added.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, traded flat at around $3,050, having tested dip demand under the psychological support of $3,000 yesterday. The cryptocurrency has seen increased demand for December call options in recent weeks.  ""Ethereum is caught between two powerful colliding forces: (declining on-chain activity + market correlation) vs. (institutional adoption + Web3),"" Ilan Solot, partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email. ""The latter will prove a secular shift, while the former is merely a cyclical dynamic. These cyclical forces are coiling ETH ever tighter into a spring.""  While top cryptocurrencies traded sideways, Terra's LUNA and privacy-focused monero (XMR) chalked up double-digit gains. Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST replaced Binance USD (BUSD) as the third-largest stablecoin by circulation during the later hours of Monday. Monero is set to implement a hard fork in July to improve network security and fee changes, developers confirmed in a GitHub post.

But that can change the bigger that stablecoin's market cap gets.

The Paris-based international organization vowed to step up monitoring of its members, which include the U.S., European Union and China, with more frequent assessments focusing on where illicit funding risks are highest.  Nine percent of jurisdictions are not compliant with norms requiring virtual asset service providers (VASP), such as wallet providers and exchanges, to ensure funds aren’t being used to launder money or finance terrorism, the report said.  Also, 37% are merely partially compliant, putting the crypto sector near the bottom of the league table alongside risky non-financial businesses such as law, accounting and real estate.  International money-laundering norms were updated in 2018 to make allowance for virtual assets, which some have feared could present a loophole to laws regarding sanctions and other financial restrictions.  Those standards are currently being implemented in jurisdictions such as the EU, which is extending the FATF rules in ways which critics say could diminish privacy and stifle innovation.

The same applies to any withdrawal. Unlike conventional platforms, players don&apos;t need to wait for days to cash out their profits. They can simply select their preferred cryptocurrency and wait a few minutes until the transaction is completed, with a much lower fee than if the user were to send the money via a bank.

42374897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw3W6f,1650369070,Crypto Options Traders Adopt New Strategies to Profit From DeFi-Led Volatility Gyrations,"Directional traders betting on bullish or bearish price trends once dominated the crypto market. Since last year, another type, known as volatility traders, has emerged. These traders bet on a rise or drop in implied or expected price volatility over a specific period.  These entities are increasingly employing strategies to profit from market information that is public; notably, the weekly automated options strategies that are auctioned by decentralized option vaults (DOVs). Every Friday at 11:00 Coordinated Universal Time (7 a.m. ET), the vaults allow anyone willing to deposit their coins there to earn double-digit annualized returns.  These vaults sell higher strike, or out-of-the-money (OTM) calls, and lower strike OTM puts, driving implied volatility lower each Friday. Sophisticated traders are virtually front-running the drop in implied volatility. The strategy is similar to running a typical short position in the spot or futures market to benefit from an expected decline in prices.  ""DOV auctions drive down volatility and [options] premium prices,"" Two Prime's DeFi options explainer published on April 8 said. ""Since these auction times and mechanics are public information, volatility sellers across short-term tenors, like Two Prime, can profit from short-selling [volatility] in front of these auctions and buying during and shortly after the auction event.""  Options are hedging instruments that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put conveys the right to sell. Demand for hedges is high when uncertainty about future price action is high. Therefore, implied volatility and options price rises with increased demand, while options selling lowers both.  Decentralized option vaults have simplified the otherwise complicated options trading for retail investors. All users need to do is deposit their coins in the vaults, which take care of complexities like selecting the appropriate strike price for selling OTM calls and puts. The premium collected from selling options represents the yield from the trade and is distributed among users in proportion to their deposits.  DOVs have seen explosive growth in a year to become a significant part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) options ecosystem, now worth nearly $1 billion as per total value locked, data source DefiLlama shows. According to Two Prime, the DOV-powered weekly covered call and covered put strategies are two of the most popular trades and currently add over $100 million of notional exposure to the market, driving the implied volatility and options prices lower.  The chart above shows that on crypto options exchange Deribit's ether implied volatility index (ETH DVOL) tends to drop in hours leading up to the weekly auctions held each Friday and rises following the conclusion of auctions.  ""In 2022, the Deribit Implied Volatility Index, a measure of implied volatility on BTC and ETH options, has trended lower into the auctions period,"" Two Prime said. ""For 100% of occurrences 4 to 7 hours leading up to the auction, volatility has fallen as short open interest pushes [options] premiums lower.""  The pattern has created a window of opportunity for savvy traders to sell volatility via short call or put positions ahead of the auction and square off the trades at relatively cheap prices brought by the auctions-induced decline in the implied volatility.  ""The strategy has been quite popular,"" Robbie Liu, senior researcher at Babel Finance, said. ""It was very profitable initially, but with time, more and more traders are doing this. So, profitability has been diminishing quickly.""  Vol selling is a risky business  Traders writing or selling options in a bid to profit from an impending drop in the implied volatility are exposed to sudden price swings.  Traders typically sell volatility (via short put or call) when the implied volatility is too high relative to its lifetime average and historical volatility. On the contrary, traders buy volatility (via long call or put) when the implied volatility is cheap compared to historical standards.  However, while implied volatility is moving away from the mean, there is no guarantee when it will do so, and there is no limit as to how high it can go. In other words, the implied volatility can stay elevated longer than volatility sellers can stay solvent.  Besides, a call option seller is obliged to sell the asset to the buyer if the latter decides to exercise the option to purchase at an agreed-upon price.  So, in theory, the seller is exposed to unlimited losses and the buyer can make an unlimited profit as the market can virtually rally to infinity. Similarly, a put seller's account can be wiped out in a falling market.  ""Selling option premium creates convex risk/reward profiles that often surpass simple long/short futures or spot trading strategies. Back-tested versions of these strategies have performed well in some environments but have also experienced significant drawdowns when markets move outside the expected range,"" Two Prime noted.

The platform is in talks with new and existing investors, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  The Sandbox is a platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to buy, sell, trade and own digital assets in a virtual world. Assets are bought and sold in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and can represent plots of land, cars, art and other property.  Among its recent users was global bank HSBC, which last month bought a plot of land in The Sandbox. The bank planned to develop that virtual parcel of land to engage with sports, e-sports and gaming fans on the platform.  SAND, the platform's native token, was priced at $2.82 at the time of writing and boasts a market capitalization of $3.27 billion, according to data by CoinMarketCap.  Last November, The Sandbox, which is majority-owned by blockchain gaming firm Animoca Brands, raised $93 million in a Series B funding round that was led by SoftBank.

The uncertainty of buyers from 7 March brought intrigue to the market and called into question the positive scenario. For 4 weeks, buyers have been trying to begin a global correction of the fall wave from May 2021. This fall wave is moving within a wedge and is doomed to a sharp contrasting reversal of the XLM price. However, will buyers be able to realize such a reversal from the current price range? During the growth wave on 7 March, buyers could not even touch the mark of $0.25. This is the first local critical point within the global wedge. https://www.tradingview.com/x/dDzEZRAs/ The trading week on 4 April was a week of counter-attacks by sellers. But, both the local growth wave and the local fall wave occur at catastrophically low volumes. This fact adds a manipulative factor and does not allow us to believe the candles, which are literally drawn on the chart. At the time of writing, buyers have been able to stop the XLM price from falling and there is a high probability of a local rebound to the $0.25 range. If buyers are unable to take control of this range during this attack, we will expect another fall wave with a final target of $0.14. It is in this range that it is quite hasty to buy XLM cryptocurrency with a global target of $0.4.

Several Asian countries have opened the way for cryptocurrency adoption. Others have enacted laws to restrict or outrightly ban cryptocurrencies due to fraud and money laundering concerns. Despite the potential benefits, cryptocurrency regulation has been slow to move in Asia. Hong Kong&apos;s regulatory sandbox framework and Singapore&apos;s licensing regime are examples of soft regulatory approaches. The Conflicting Reactions — Pakistan, India, Singapore, and Thailand As a country that has gained independence from the British empire, Pakistan faces the challenges of foreign investment. While the economy has not shown signs of significant growth in recent years, it is still one of the top 3 crypto holders globally. However, alongside their Central bank, their government is making moves to ban crypto transactions. Despite recent developments, India is still one of the leading jurisdictions globally when it comes to regulating crypto. India is actively encouraging the use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

42374893,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw3W49,1650360482,Privacy Focused Monero Plans Hard Fork in July; XMR Surges 11% on ‘Monerun’,"Privacy protocol Monero will undergo a tentative hard fork in July which would see improved network security and fee changes, developers confirmed in a GitHub post. A testnet deployment is expected in May.  No separate coin will be issued after the mainnet hard fork at a block height of 2,668,888, which is expected to be in July. Hard forks refer to a change to a blockchain protocol that renders older versions invalid.  Monero is a privacy-centric protocol that masks the wallet addresses of users making it difficult for others to trace and track transactions. This is unlike bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies, where wallet addresses and transactional behavior can be analyzed to determine the identity of their users.  What happens after V15?  July’s hard fork will be Monero’s fifteenth software version (V15). The previous two versions went live in October 2020 and introduced marginal upgrades.  V15 would see an increase in Monero’s ring size from 11 to 16 alongside fixes to its multiple signature (multisig) mechanism. As per developer documents, multisig refers to a transaction which needs multiple signatures before it can be submitted to the Monero network and executed, while ring size refers to the total number of signers in a ring signature.  A ring signature is a type of digital signature in which a group of possible signers is merged together to produce a single, distinctive signature that can authorize a transaction.  The V15 upgrade would also introduce “bulletproof+,” an upgrade to the bulletproof technology deployed on Monero in 2018 which ensures that the information stored within a confidential transaction doesn't contain any false information.  Did “Monerun” contribute to XMR surge  XMR, the native tokens of Monero, surged some 11% in the past 24 hours as developers confirmed the July hard fork.  Prices spiked to as much as $277 on Monday night, breaking over a major resistance level at $240. Prices slumped to the $257 level at the time of writing.  However, a Bloomberg report pegged a separate catalyst driving demand for the tokens on a seemingly coordinated effort from Monero community members on Reddit.  “April 18th. We're withdrawing XMR from exchanges. Any exchange that hasn't disabled withdraws (which many of them have already), we're pulling our funds,” a popular post titled “The Monerun” from last week stated. The date also marked eight years since Monero was initially launched.  Community members allege Monero's obfuscated ledger has allowed crypto exchanges to misrepresent their reserves and sell XMR “that they don't actually have.” The bank run of sorts entices community members to pull their holdings from exchanges. This is in a bid to test if the exchanges actually hold XMR or not.  Exchanges Binance, Bitfinex and HitBTC did not return requests for comment on the ""Monerun"" allegations. The three attract some of the highest XMR trading volumes among all other crypto exchanges.",POSITIVE,XMR,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | XMR | FORKS,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/19/privacy-focused-monero-plans-hard-fork-in-july-xmr-surges-11-on-monerun,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a98548bee4a08fdba00df01b64f6832aef742ed5-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the latest estimates suggest, the number of crypto wallets related to gaming witnessed an astounding increase from 29,563 at the start of 2021 to a whopping 754,000 in the third quarter of 2021. With this impressive growth rate, it is no surprise that savvy crypto investors have started to focus on the next big thing in the crypto market: play to earn gaming. Axie Infinity, for example, touched an astonishing market cap of $7.8 billion, which some experts believe led to a frenzy for P2E games. Other P2E games, such as The Sandbox, saw an upsurge in activity, reaching millions of users globally. So far, most of these popular P2E titles are based on the gold standard of smart contracts, Ethereum. However, similarly to the DeFi space, users and investors alike have started to voice their concerns about Ethereum&apos;s limitations, namely scalability and high transaction fees. To tackle these issues, P2E game developers turned their attention to Ethereum alternatives that can truly support the growth of this nascent industry.

42420976,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAopx,1650354514,UK Crypto Industry Hopes for More Clarity From Planned Stablecoin Rules,"The U.K.’s crypto industry is hopeful the nation’s forthcoming stablecoin regulations will clear up “gray areas” for issuers.  Last Monday, the U.K.’s Treasury, the government's finance arm, announced it would regulate stablecoins under its payments framework as a first step in a multi-stage process to establish a robust crypto regulatory regime.  This means stablecoin issuers would have to comply with the 2017 payment service regulations, which would require them to register with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and follow rules on providing payment services, as well as meet specific requirements for payment transactions.  For Kene Ezeji-Okoye, co-founder of Millicent, a U.K. stablecoin provider, the move could clear up “gray areas” in how companies like Millicent can remain compliant with U.K. law. The company’s model fits under the FCA’s e-money system but because it also plans to hold custody of users’ cryptographic keys, Millicent could be classified as a crypto asset company as well.  E-money systems have to follow the electronic money regulations, while crypto asset providers have to register with the FCA, the U.K.'s financial regulator, and comply with its anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.  Read more: UK Aims to Become Global Crypto Hub, Exchequer Says  A welcomed move  Many companies welcome the U.K. government's ambition to be a crypto hub.  “The increased use of stablecoins warrants the need for policymakers and regulators to establish the proper regulatory framework, and we applaud the U.K. for leading on this front,” a spokesperson for stablecoin provider Gemini said in a statement.  Similarly, a spokesperson for fellow stablecoin issuer Tether said the U.K. could become “one of the first countries” to issue clear guidance on this type of digital asset.  “We applaud [Rishi Sunak, U.K. chancellor of the exchequer] for recognizing the importance of rigorous regulation in the digital currency space,” said Simon Cohen, managing associate at Ontier LLP, a U.K.-based crypto law firm.  Regulators also welcome the move.  In 2019, the FCA published a report on crypto that said crypto firms with digital assets for cross-border payments could be subject to payment services regulations, but the tokens themselves wouldn’t be regulated. The Treasury’s announcement means this will change.  “We welcome the announcement of plans to develop a new regulatory regime for stablecoins and crypto activities, and we will continue to work closely with the government ahead of its consultation,” said Sarah Pritchard, executive director of markets at the FCA, in a statement. Pritchard referenced the fact that the government will consult on the wider regulation of the crypto asset sector later this year.  Stablecoins and the UK  The Treasury released its results on its 2021 consultation on stablecoins alongside its stablecoin announcement on April 4. The report said there was broad agreement that stablecoins backed by a single currency should be subject to e-money requirements, though it acknowledged that not all business models can meet those standards.  The Treasury’s plan is to not only amend the existing payments regulation, but also the 2011 electronic money regulations to factor in stablecoins. This should ensure companies are registered with the FCA and will require them to comply with record-keeping and safeguarding rules.  The detailed requirements for stablecoins have not been introduced yet and will be developed with the help of the U.K.’s Bank of England and Payment Systems Regulator, said Alpay Soytürk, chief regulatory officer at Spectrum Markets, a pan-European trading venue for securitized derivatives with offices in London, in a statement.  There was a general agreement in the U.K. government consultation report that systemic stablecoin issuers and wallets should be subject to regulation by the Bank of England. For example, if a firm providing custody meets the requirements of the Banking Act, the firm would be considered as systemic and be regulated by the FCA and the Bank of England.  Other regulations that need to be amended include the Financial Services Act 2013, Soytürk said. The act focuses on financial services and markets.  The consultation report said U.K. regulation should capture all stablecoins that include fiat currencies, such as a single currency stablecoin or stablecoins backed with a basket of currencies.  In its consultation, the government proposed that algorithmic stablecoins, or those that may be linked to assets other than fiat, should not be regulated at all.  An algorithmic stablecoin is one that in theory can keep its peg to fiat using only software and rules, meaning it is not necessarily backed by any collateral. Instead, the token’s programming, or smart contract, can increase supply if the price is going down or reduce it if the price increases.  “Where it's going to become more difficult is with the algorithmic stablecoins, because obviously they're a very different type of entity because they don't touch the traditional banking sector - they're decentralized,” said Ryan Shea, crypto economist at Trakx, a crypto trading platform headquartered in Paris and London.  He told CoinDesk that it would be difficult for regulators to apply existing rules to algorithmic stablecoins.  The U.K. government plans on establishing an FCA authorization and supervision regime for stablecoins that could be used as a means of payment, it said in its consultation report.  Crypto and the U.K.  U.K. regulators still have work to do. The 2022 report by YouGov, a research and data analytics group, showed that crypto adoption in Great Britain was low compared with a number of other markets, most notably those in the Middle East and Asia Pacific.  “Although adoption is projected to grow in Great Britain in the midterm, the primary barriers to growth stem from security and regulatory concerns,” Emma McInnes, global head of Financial Services at YouGov, told CoinDesk in an interview. “With recent announcements made by the U.K. government regarding regulation of businesses exposed to crypto assets, it remains to be seen whether these will be sufficient to provide consumer reassurance to allay these concerns.”  “Indeed, we have already seen some companies moving their crypto services operations from the U.K. to other markets, to ensure they can continue offering crypto services to Britons but from outside of the new U.K. regulatory regime,” McInnes said.  Read more: The UK Wants to Regulate Crypto: Here's What That Could Look Like  What is missing?  The lack of clarity around the U.K’s latest announcements leaves the crypto community wanting more to feel confident about operating in the country.  In its response to its recent consultation, the Treasury said the regulatory framework for crypto assets and its classifications should be designed with flexibility, since static definitions could “quickly” become outdated.  “[We are] really waiting to see what the U.K. says is the definition of a stablecoin and which stablecoins are allowed to be used for payments because under the current system, some stablecoins like the ones that we're using, do fall under the e-money regulation so can already be used for payments,” Ezeji-Okoye said.  The U.K. government said in its consultation results it was considering whether it should also have a new definition for “payment crypto asset.” This would include any cryptographically secured digital representation of monetary value that is backed by one or more fiat currencies and/or is issued and used as a means of making payments.  “The big focus for me is to make sure that we're clear with the definitions that are too broad in nature, that might be confusing for people in the U.K.,” Ian Taylor, executive director at CryptoUK, a trade body, said in an interview with CoinDesk.

The potential for DeFi is immense, but some traditional financial institutions may not fully integrate the technology into their processes. This article will outline some DeFi technology trends to keep an eye on. Defi is the future of financial transactions, so it&apos;s important to stay abreast of this growing technology. Blockchain Bridges Blockchain bridges are a vital part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, connecting different chains. They monitor both networks simultaneously and &apos;pick up&apos; the tokens in one network and &apos;issue&apos; them in the other. The teams behind blockchain bridge projects have a deep understanding of this technology, with world-class fintech and cloud engineering backgrounds. The teams can combine consulting, design, and engineering at scale. Before, only one chain can exchange assets from one with another. Hence, it was not possible to use ETH in Solana Dapps without transferring it through exchanges. A cross-chain bridge, on the other hand, provides this interoperability. The WBTC bridge is the largest blockchain bridge, with over $12 billion in TVL. However, hardline decentralization advocates may argue that WBTC is less secure than decentralized bridges. However, there are several other benefits of bridging assets. Blockchain bridges allow users to use tokens on different networks without switching platforms.

LUNA pushed past the $80-$82 mark, a pivot support level, to as much as $92.07 during early Asian hours. Profit-taking saw prices fall to $89 at writing time, another support level for the token. The move comes after a nearly 37% drop in the first two weeks of April following lifetime highs of $120 earlier this month.  LUNA is a governance token for money market protocol Terra. The spike comes as Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST toppled Binance USD (BUSD) to become the third-largest stablecoin by circulation, during the later hours of Monday.  Terra also became the largest buyer of Convex’s CVX token over the past 30 days with over $17 million in purchases, according to research firm Delphi Digital.  Convex is a protocol that allows users to earn fees without locking their CRV, the token of the decentralized lending project Curve. Fees earned on Terra’s deposits are distributed among Terra users.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies, usually the U.S. dollar, with each token backed by an equivalent amount of fiat in reserve. Algorithmic stablecoins like UST take this one step ahead and can be backed by a basket of assets, such as bitcoin (BTC), without depending on any centralized third party to hold those assets.  In February, major crypto funds led by Jump Crypto invested $1 billion in the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a Singapore-based nonprofit that aims to maintain UST’s peg by purchasing several assets as reserve backing.  LFG has since purchased bitcoin, Avalanche’s AVAX, other stablecoins, data shows, with Terra also donating 10 million LUNA, worth $890 million at current prices, last week.
