42414585,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBUnN,1674518073,Porsche NFT Collection Fails to Gain Traction as Mint Kicks Into Gear,"German carmaker Porsche released its first non-fungible token (NFT) collection on Monday, though the project isn’t racing towards high resale prices as fans may have speculated.  The 7,500-edition collection, which pays homage to the brand’s iconic 911 sports car, opened minting for allowlist holders at 9 a.m. ET on Monday in four waves of one hour each. After the initial allowlist mint ended, the mint was released to the general public with an open-ended stop time. Collectors were allowed to mint up to three virtual 911 Porsches at 0.911 ETH each, roughly $1,490.  The next phases of the mint process allow holders to choose one of three “paths” to follow and customize the design and rarity of their NFTs.  In the hours after the mint initially opened, sales of the collection appeared to stall. At the time of writing on Monday evening, only 1,198 NFTs – about 16% of the total collection – had been sold through Porsche’s official website.  Sales on the secondary market also appeared idle. At the time of writing, the collection’s floor price was 0.89 ETH, or about $1,450 – meaning, the collection was selling for $50 cheaper on secondary marketplaces such as OpenSea while the mint was ongoing.  Porsche announced its buzzy NFT endeavor at Miami Art Week in December with much anticipation. The company partnered with German digital collectible company Fanzone’s subsidiary Road2Dreams to distribute the tokens.  Some Twitter users pushed back against the collection, noting its expensive mint price and sales strategy that appeared misaligned with the ethos of Web3.  Porsche and Road2Dreams did not immediately respond to CoinDesk for comment.  Dave Krugman, artist and founder of NFT creative agency Allships, shared his thoughts about the collection’s mint price on Twitter, calling it out touch with its target Web3 community. He told CoinDesk that larger Web2 brands entering the Web3 space must act for the long term when releasing NFTs.  “When you begin your journey in this space by extracting millions of dollars from the community, you are setting impossibly high expectations, cutting out 99% of market participants and overvaluing your assets before you have proven you can back up their valuation,” said Krugman.  “If you can start from the bottom up, you build an organic community of committed advocates with aligned incentives.”",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Cam Thompson, Rosie Perper",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/23/porsche-nft-collection-fails-to-gain-traction-as-mint-kicks-into-gear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91dda4d48bef0ebfb991f31190249d4182f50312-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414584,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBUi4,1674515837,FBI: North Korean Hackers Behind $100M Horizon Bridge Theft,"A pair of North Korean hacker groups were behind the June theft of $100 million in crypto assets from Horizon Bridge, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said in a Monday statement.  Horizon Bridge, a service enabling crypto assets to be traded between the Harmony blockchain and other blockchains, was drained of ether (ETH), tether (USDT) and wrapped bitcoin (wBTC). The FBI said that the hackers – “cyber actors associated with the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea]” – relied on a malware campaign known as “TraderTraitor” in the Harmony attack.  Two weeks ago, a privacy protocol, Railgun, was used to launder more than $60 million in ETH stolen during last year’s theft, according to the FBI. A portion of it was sent to other service providers and changed to bitcoin. Some of the funds were frozen, and others were moved to addresses identified in the agency’s statement.  At least one industry research firm had already partially come to the same conclusion on the identity of the attackers last year, identifying Lazarus and North Korea.  U.S. authorities said that North Korea’s thefts of crypto and laundering of the assets are used “to support North Korea’s ballistic missile and Weapons of Mass Destruction programs,” according to the statement.  Lazarus Group had previously been accused of stealing more than $600 million of cryptocurrency from the Axie Infinity-linked Ronin bridge.

7948867,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517169,1674514813,Ethereum Closes Near Its Next Profit Take Region As Bullish Momentum Continues,"The Ethereum price has been propelling itself considerably ever since Bitcoin crossed the $20,000 price mark. Over the last 24 hours, ETH has slightly moved down on its chart, depicting consolidated price action. Last week helped the Ethereum price move up by 6%. The coin finally broke past its consolidation at the $1,500 price level and has been moving north ever since. The technical outlook of the coin has pointed towards continued bullishness on the chart. Accumulation has increased substantially ever since Ethereum breached the $1,500 price level. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could See Another 30% Rally The chance of a price reversal cannot be ruled out just yet, as ETH was overbought and overvalued. Currently, Ethereum has secured $1,600 as the support level. The next price correction could help traders with buying opportunities. A price correction might not occur over the immediate trading sessions as demand for the coin remains quite high on the chart. Ethereum’s price might continue on the upside before the coin retraces. The market capitalization of Ethereum increased, which also reflected that the buying sentiment remained high. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ETH was exchanging hands at $1,620 at the time of writing. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $1,690; it even corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. A move above $1,690 will help Ethereum touch the $1,700 price mark. The $1,700 price mark is crucial, as touching or breaching this mark could mean continued bullish momentum for the crypto. ETH could even soar to $2,000 if the $1,700 price mark is crossed. This region will act as a profit-take region for traders. On the flip side, if the bullish momentum slows down, the first fall would be at $1,600 and then at $1,520. The amount of Ethereum traded in the last session was red, signifying a downtick in buying. Technical Analysis The altcoin was still in the overbought zone, which also means that Ethereum broke a multi-month record in terms of accumulation. The Relative Strength Index was parked a little below the 80-mark, which still signified heavy buying strength and bullishness. If demand stays at this level, bullish momentum will not fade out anytime soon. ETH was also trading above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating that buyers were driving the price momentum. On the contrary, the 200-SMA line crossed the 20-SMA line, which implies that the coin might be headed for southbound price movement. As accumulation has remained at a record high for the coin, chances of a price pullback still remain for the altcoin. The Awesome Oscillator, which signifies price direction, displayed red histograms, which meant that these were sell signals for the altcoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Technicals Suggest DOGE Must Clear $0.920 For Another Rally Sell signals can be accompanied by a fall in price. Ethereum may briefly fall in price before resuming its upward trend. The Directional Movement Index was still positive, as the +DI line (blue) was above the -DI line (orange). The Average Directional Index (red) shot past 40, which suggested that price direction would gain further strength, which will push ETH to break past its nearest price ceiling of $1,700.

Genesis’ lending arm halted withdrawals on Nov. 18, 2022, after what its lawyers described as “a run on the bank” in the wake of FTX’s collapse earlier that month. Two months later, on Jan. 19, Genesis Global Holdco – the holding company of Genesis Global Capital – and two of its subsidiaries, Genesis Asia Pacific (GAP) and Genesis Global Capital (GGC), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York.  Genesis’ lawyers – from the New York-based law firm Cleary Gottleib – told bankruptcy court Judge Sean H. Lane at a hearing on Monday they expect to reach an agreement with the creditors by the end of the week.  “We have a timeline and an approach to get through this case as quickly as possible,” Genesis attorney Sean O’Neal told the judge. “We really want to avoid getting involved in a prolonged case with litigation that effectively destroys value that would otherwise be available for the creditors.”  Another lawyer for Genesis, Jane VanLare, told the court that one thing the crypto lender is considering is a sale of itself to generate funds to pay back creditors.  “We do intend to conduct a marketing and sale process and/or raise additional capital,” VanLare said. “If the process does not result in the sale of a business, the equity interest in GGH, which is the Holdco entity, will be distributed to the debtors’ creditors.”  According to a declaration filed by Genesis interim CEO Derar Islim, the company has more than $5 billion in liabilities – a sum considerably larger than its assets which, according to a presentation to the court on Monday, include approximately $150 million in unencumbered cash, $500 million in digital assets, $385 million in brokerage accounts and $505 million in outstanding loans to third parties. Also among the assets are large sums owed by its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG) – a $575 million loan maturing in May and a $1.1 billion promissory note due in 2032.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Gemini has been swept up in the bankruptcy of crypto lender Genesis Global Capital and has been unable to pay out funds to its Earn account holders. Gemini's founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, have engaged in a Twitter war with Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis, over the $900 million owed to Earn customers. (DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.)  “It was our hope to avoid further reductions after this summer, however, persistent negative macroeconomic conditions and unprecedented fraud perpetuated by bad actors in our industry have left us with no other choice but to revise our outlook and further reduce headcount,” wrote Cameron Winklevoss, the president and co-founder of Gemini, in the internal message.  Gemini had previously cut 10% of its staff in June, followed by more layoffs in July, according to TechCrunch. Gemini’s headcount was down overall from 1,100 at the start of 2022 to between 650 and 700 people near the end of the year, according to The Information.  Many large crypto companies, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, Blockchain.com and ConsenSys, have cut staff in recent weeks amid the ongoing crypto winter. CoinDesk estimates nearly 27,000 jobs have been lost across the industry since April of last year.  Gemini declined to comment on this story.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at around $22,950, up 2.3% for the day. BTC moved sideways earlier Monday and briefly reached as high as $23,158 in early afternoon trading hours (ET) before retreating. According to data from CoinShares, short-bitcoin investment products saw inflows of $25.5 million last week, the largest amount since last July, when $51 million went into those products in one week.  Equities closed up amid continued hopes that the U.S. central bank will ratchet back its hawkish monetary policy. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 2% while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were up 1.1% and 0.7%, respectively.  Ether (ETH): ETH followed BTC’s pattern, rising 0.4% to recently to trade at $1,630. Ethereum's Shanghai hard fork will begin this spring. Developers said they had successfully created a copy of the blockchain – known as a “shadow fork” – to provide a testing environment.  FTX’s FTT Token: FTT has rallied nearly 150% this month as a bull revival in the broader market triggered a short squeeze in the battered cryptocurrency. Data tracked by Kaiko Research shows a balanced order book in Binance's FTT-BUSD market, with the number of buy orders for 20,000 FTT or more now matching similar-sized sell orders. FTT previously crashed 96% in November, hitting a low of 81 cents as its parent exchange went bust. As of publication time, FTT was trading at $2.2, up 8% for the day, according to data from CoinGecko.  Axie Infinity (AXS): Play-to-earn giant Axie Infinity's AXS cryptocurrency is rallying despite the impending unlocking of millions of dollars worth of tokens. AXS was trading as high as a four-month high of $13.94 earlier Monday before it had settled back to around $12.6 as of publication time. It was up 13% in the past 24 hours.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin’s Surge Moves Both Short- and Long-Term Holders Into Profitability  By Glenn Williams Jr.  The Long Term Holder MVRV (market value to realized valued) ratio has risen above 1.0 for the first time in six months, indicating that the cost basis for long-term holders is now below the spot price of bitcoin.  Clearly, investors getting long (buying and owning an asset expected to appreciate over time) on BTC at a lower cost basis following a prolonged decline in BTC's price is driving this trend. But with over 97.5% of short-term supply now in profit, will newer BTC investors cash in on the move higher or maintain their positions, ultimately becoming long-term holders themselves? And what is the significance of either move?  Evidence from January 2018, April 2021 and November 2021 indicates that an increase in short-term supply in profit above 97.5% preceded sharp price downturns. Are markets now headed in that direction?  Investors may also wish to scrutinize the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) and the amount of bitcoin being sent to exchanges, among other indicators. The SSR declines as investors send more stablecoins to exchanges relative to BTC. This trend indicates more capital being sent to exchanges for the purposes of acquiring more bitcoin. A similar metric to remember is the exchange reserve balance of stablecoins, because an increase indicates increased buying pressure.  Read the full technical take here.

Price action on BTCUSD the weekly timeframe, according to the Relative Strength Index, has reached a critical line that separates bear market from bull market. Any higher, and crypto could experience a full blown breakout. Let’s take a look. What The Relative Strength Tells Us About Cryptocurrencies The Relative Strength Index is a popular technical indicator used in cryptocurrencies, originally created by J. Welles Wilder in the 1970s. The tool measures momentum through the “velocity and magnitude of price movements,” according to Wikipedia. Readings above 70 can indicate overbought conditions, and falling below 30 suggests an oversold market. In rare instances, the RSI will remain overheated depicting an especially powerful trend. Most of the time it remains somewhere between 30 and 70 while prices consolidate or move sideways. Related Reading: Overbought Or Ready To Rip? Bitcoin Daily RSI Reaches Explosive Levels On higher timeframes, moving past the middle-zone on the RSI can send lower timeframes through the roof — or through the floor. In the case of BTCUSD weekly charts, the RSI suggests this exact line in the sand is currently separating what could be a full breakout into a bull market – or a harsh rejection. Breaching this level on the RSI led to bullish rallies | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Reaches Critical Line In The Sand Between Bear & Bull Market Looking back throughout the history of Bitcoin, pushing above roughly 55-56 on the RSI has in the past led to extraordinarily bullish moves. Falling below it lead to the the deadliest declines and bear markets. Even worse, as BTCUSD weekly finds itself at the key trigger level, rejection has resulted in some brutal moves. In 2014 a rejection from there kicked off the second phase of the bear market. In 2015, a bull market attempt was harshly rejected back to bear market lows. Related Reading: “Parabolic” Signal That Triggered Past Bitcoin Bull Runs Reappears The latest instance in 2020 a bull market was rejected and combined with the onset of COVID, resulted in the Black Thursday collapse. Considering the importance of the level and the fact some of the worst rejections ever have taken place when the RSI reached such a reading, it is no surprise investors remain skeptical and cautious. If Bitcoin can make it above the current zone on the Relative Strength Index, the bull market could be back on in a flash. Currently, BTCUSD daily charts show a wildly elevated RSI, well into overbought conditions. However, extended phases of daily RSI levels support bull market behavior, and could indicate that the weekly RSI and further higher timeframes might also approach overbought levels at some point in the future.

The over-the-counter trading desk’s wallet transferred out 75,000 ETH to various crypto exchanges on Jan. 19. A CoinDesk analysis shows that’s the fifth-biggest single-day movement ever.  Read more: Genesis’ Crypto Trading Arm Is Moving Money Around, a Sign of Normality Amid Sibling’s Bankruptcy  The days with a bigger ETH outflow from the wallet – which all took place last year – coincided with major milestones for Genesis. Here are the bigger days for the wallet, which has an address beginning with 0xd62:  On Aug 15, Genesis transferred out 94,595 ETH: Two days later then-CEO Michael Moro exited the company and 20% of its 260-person workforce was eliminated.  On Sept. 30, Genesis transferred out 82,556 ETH: Co-Head of Sales and Trading Matt Ballensweig had announced his decision to leave two days before.  On Oct. 25, Genesis transferred 108,974 ETH: This was several days after Chief Risk Officer Michael Patchen exited the company after only three months in the job.  On Nov. 9, Genesis transferred out 86,220 ETH: As FTX was collapsing, Digital Currency Group, the parent of both Genesis and CoinDesk, gave an equity infusion of $140 million to Genesis Global Trading two days later. In the middle of November, Genesis’ lending division, Genesis Global Capital, suspended customer redemptions and new loan originations.  Last week’s bankruptcy filing by Genesis Global Capital, the lending business, raised doubts about its future, but the movement of money suggests its related entity, trading firm Genesis Global Trading, continues to operate.

42414583,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBBUcl,1674508741,VC Firm Pantera's 2023 Crypto Forecast Says the Future Is DeFi,"Crypto-focused venture capital firm Pantera Capital, which has about $3.8 billion in assets under management, has summed up its 2023 forecast, and the future is decentralized finance (DeFi).  The bear market that emerged early last year was worsened by a wave of headline-grabbing exploits and bankruptcies, including the implosion of multibillion-dollar centralized exchange FTX and last week’s filing by crypto lender Genesis, a sister company of CoinDesk’s.  “Pantera has managed blockchain funds through three previous ‘crypto winters’,” noted Pantera CEO and co-Chief Investment Officer Dan Morehead in the forward of his investor letter, titled “The Year Ahead.”  “Each one had supposedly catastrophic events. For example, when Mt. Gox went down, it represented 85% market share – much larger than FTX today,” Morehead continued. “Blockchain is going to change the world. It will certainly survive these issues.”  2023 crypto market outlook  “Looking forward, I think it seems fairly evident that the historical arc of the world’s financial rails will end up as blockchain-based systems using smart contracts. The real questions are how we get there and what needs to happen to get there,” wrote Pantera co-Chief Investment Officer Joey Krug in a section of the letter.  He noted that scalability systems have brought transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain to under 10 cents. He expects that future upgrades to Ethereum and protocol extensions for layer 2 scalability systems will further push transaction fees down to around 1 cent, which would help decentralized exchanges compete with the larger centralized exchanges.  Krug sees the “end state” of crypto as a world where the “average person will have apps on their phone that give them access to DeFi, where they’ll be able to engage in financial transactions without banks/brokers, with lower fees, global liquidity and markets operating 24/7.” However, Krug wrote, achieving this end state requires solutions to a number of current problems that break down into two categories: increasing liquidity in DeFi and making DeFi easier to use, particularly for those new to crypto.  Regarding liquidity, Krug said it’s important to get more institutional capital into DeFi in the form of more federal- or state-regulated custodians that directly support using Ethereum. Another method would be to aggregate liquidity across multiple chains, layer 2s and liquidity pools on those chains, which would allow apps to essentially scan for the best price and execution after users submit a trade. Such aggregation, however, would require building secure cross-chain bridges – which might seem like a lofty goal after the wave of exploits to such bridges in 2022.  As for usability issues in DeFi, Krug said they have gotten better but there is still room for improvement with crypto wallets in particular. Simplified user experience, or UX, design, elimination of trading fees having to be paid in ether (ETH) regardless of the asset being traded and better fiat on-ramps are all listed as important improvements.  Pantera Capital General Partner Paul Veradittakit outlined his 2023 predictions in a CoinDesk article in December, and forecast increased investments in DeFi, Ethereum scalability technology and non-fungible tokens (NFT).

Bitcoin Puell Multiple 365-Day Rate Of Change Has Shot Up As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, this could be one of the first indications of the return of the bull market. The “Puell Multiple” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the daily Bitcoin mining revenue (in USD) and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, miners are making more income than the yearly average right now. On the other hand, values below the threshold imply the revenues of these chain validators is less than usual. As miner revenues shift, these holders become more or less likely to sell BTC (depending on which way of the break-even mark the ratio has swung in), which is a factor that can affect the price of the crypto. Thus, when the Puell Multiple is greater than 1, BTC may be considered overvalued, while being lesser than this value might suggest the coin is undervalued. The relevant indicator here is not the Puell Multiple itself but its rate of change (RoC). The RoC displays the speed at which any metric changes its value over a defined period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Whales Go On $1.4B Buying Spree In particular, the 365-day RoC of the Puell Multiple is of interest in the current discussion. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator over the course of the different Bitcoin cycles: Looks like the value of the metric has spiked in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant In the above graph, the quant has marked the relevant zones for the Bitcoin Puell Multiple 365-day RoC. It seems like tops have taken place in the crypto price whenever the metric has touched the red line, while mid-cycle highs have been set around the orange line. And it would appear that bear markets have lasted while the indicator has been around the green line. It also looks like transitions to and from bear markets have generally followed the dotted line historically. Related Reading: Bearish Indicator: Are Big Players No Longer Interested In Bitcoin? Recently, as Bitcoin has sharply rallied, miner revenues have also shot up, leading to the Puell Multiple also observing a rise. As the chart displays, the 365-day RoC of the indicator has naturally seen some rapid rise in recent days. With this spike, the metric has finally crossed above the dotted line, which could mean, if the past pattern is anything to go by, that the bear market may be coming to an end, and the crypto might have started transitioning towards a bullish trend. The analyst notes, however, that it will still take some more price action before this breakout can be fully confirmed.

According to analytics firm Glassnode, as of time of writing the percentage of short-term profiting BTC holders increased to 97.5%, its highest level since November. Bitcoin has also been profitable for long-term BTC holders, according to Glassnode.  ""Long-term"" is considered over 155 days while ""short-term"" is less than 155 days.     The Long Term Holder MVRV (market value to realized valued) ratio has risen above 1.0 for the first time in six months, indicating that the cost basis for long-term holders is now below the spot price of bitcoin.  Clearly, investors getting long (buying and owning an asset expected to appreciate over time) on BTC at a lower cost basis following a prolonged decline in BTC's price is driving this trend. But with over 97.5% of short-term supply now in profit, will newer BTC investors cash in on the move higher or maintain their positions, ultimately becoming long-term holders themselves? And what is the significance of either move?  Evidence from January 2018, April 2021 and November 2021 indicates that an increase in short-term supply in profit above 97.5% preceded sharp downturns in price. Are markets now headed in that direction?  Investors may also wish to scrutinize the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) and the amount of bitcoin being sent to exchanges, among other indicators.  The SSR declines as investors send more stablecoins to exchanges relative to BTC. This trend indicates more capital being sent to exchanges for the purposes of acquiring more bitcoin. A similar metric to remember is the exchange reserve balance of stablecoins, because an increase indicates increased buying pressure.  The SSR has increased slightly since Jan. 9, while the exchange balance for stablecoins has declined, which may be concerning to investors.  The opposite holds true for the bitcoin exchange reserve balance. Bullish investors would not want to see bitcoin exchange balances rise because such an increase would suggest more investors are sending BTC to exchanges for the purpose of selling.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/23/crypto-markets-analysis-bitcoins-surge-moves-both-short-and-long-term-holders-into-profitability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83087f6cbd67c294583015c48cfe9abde266f64a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Investors should be aware that while WGMI has jumped by a triple-digit percentage in less than one month, the fund was also crushed in 2022, cratering 83% last year from $26.20 a share to $4.47 a share. In Monday's afternoon trading, WGMI was sitting at $8.65 after touching $9.06 earlier. Even with the recent upswing, the ETF remains about 68% lower for the past 12 months.

The new system, Buterin noted, would differ from the privacy-focused functionalities provided by crypto mixers such as Tornado Cash, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in August 2022 for its alleged use in laundering virtual currency stolen by North Korean hackers.

7941700,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517175,1674504033,"Why Bitcoin Has The Momentum To Run Beyond 23,000","The price of Bitcoin keeps smashing resistance levels while reclaiming previously lost territory. Unlike other rallies into the current area, this price action might suggest a persistent trend and a new dawn for the industry following months of collapsing companies and bankruptcies. Related Reading: Is Litecoin (LTC) Expecting A Pullback Before Soaring Again? As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $22,800 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous week, the cryptocurrency records a 10% profit. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market capitalization are experiencing similar price action with substantial profits over this period. Is Bitcoin Finally At Bottom Levels? According to an analyst at Jarvis Labs, the current Bitcoin rally results from a long period of consolidation below the 200-Day Moving Average (MA). This moving average is one of BTC’s most important levels operating as critical support during the bearish cycles. As Bitcoin reclaims the 200-day MA at around $19,520, the analyst wants to see a consolidation above this level. The rally might extend if the cryptocurrency can hold above it, pushing BTC into further highs, solidifying “a flip of the 200-day MA from resistance to support.” As seen in the chart below, during the 2019 bear market, BTC saw a long consolidation below its 200-day MA before reclaiming these levels later in the year. According to the analyst, the longer the consolidation, the better the improvement for BTC’s overall market structure as other moving averages rise. The above does not imply that Bitcoin will continuously trend to the upside, back to its all-time high of $69,000. Instead, it suggests that BTC’s market health is improving, with the foundation for further gains increasing. This new status quo makes any potential decline an opportunity for optimistic investors. The Jarvis Labs analyst wrote: (…) And while there is still a reasonably high probability that early January price levels will be revisited again at some point in 2023, there is also a strong piece of data which suggests any such retest would present a prime buying opportunity. Accumulation Levels Hint At 2019 Like BTC Bottom In addition to this period of consolidation below the 200-day MA, which hints at a 2019-like bottom, BTC has seen “persistent accumulation.” The image below shows that Bitcoin investors have been “moderately accumulating” (Blue dots in the chart below) more of the cryptocurrency. Similar to the 2018-2019 bear market, this accumulation period preceded market rallies. In the coming months, Bitcoin should see more aggressive accumulation (Red dots in the chart below) to support another bullish season. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) remains the biggest obstacle to a Bitcoin rally. The financial institution is hiking interest rates to reduce inflation while hurting financial markets.

He is proposing a stealth address system as a possible fix. Vitalik Buterin’s idea radically differs from what Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer, and similar platforms offer. Instead of the sender having control, it would be the recipient in charge. This is crucially important because, in ordinary settings, the asset receiver would desire to keep transactions, financial or otherwise, private and away from the public’s prying eyes. Related Reading: The Blockchain that Brings Privacy to the Masses By default, transactions in Ethereum and other public blockchains can be traced. This characteristic is available for all users, despite the basic levels of encryptions concealing the identity of the sender and receivers. Ethereum Price on January 23| Source: ETHUSDT on KuCoin, Trading View Vitalik Buterin Talks Stealth Addresses To counter the openness in Ethereum and cushion the privacy of asset receivers, stealth addresses would be created by the sender or receiver. However, the receiver will be the one in charge. At any point in the transfer cycle, the receiver will be free to create a spending key which he can then use to create a “stealth meta-address.” This address is then sent to the sender, who does a small computation and creates a stealth address that belongs to the recipient. The recipient will always be in charge if they send assets to this address. Additional cryptographic data will be published on-chain to affirm that the receiver controls the stealth address. A key blinding mechanism is added to break the public link between the sending and receiving addresses due to the additional cryptographic data sent on-chain. Related Reading: Newly Discovered Monero (XMR) Glitch Will Negatively Affect Transaction’s Privacy Vitalik also proposes the integration of ZK-SNARKs to boost privacy further when using stealth addresses. Integrating ZK SNARKs would increase the difficulty of linking transactors, a benefit for the receiving address seeking more privacy. Different from Tornado Cash Vitalik explains in his research blog that the stealth address system provides a different kind of privacy offered by Tornado Cash. The co-founder notes that Tornado Cash is only suitable for individuals who want to send assets to their addresses. While Tornado Cash is widely popular and used by thousands to obscure ETH and ERC-20 transactions, it cannot hide the receiving address of assets complying with the ERC-721 standard, mainly NFTs. In early August 2022, the United States Treasury Department barred U.S. citizens from using the mixer. The Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said the Tornado Cash creators had failed to add adequate controls to prevent the tool from being used to launder money. Treasury alleged that North Korean hackers and other agents had used the tool to launder billions of dollars since 2019.

Overall, if legislation is passed, it could be a “big positive” for the industry, Dowling said.  “Having some clear rules of the road and rebuilding trust is going to be imperative,” Dowling said. She said stablecoin issuers may have to have ""one-to-one"" backing for their coins and no leverage. Legislation may help the U.S. as it looks to keep up with other countries and could even set a regulatory standard, she said.  “If we start with our regulatory foundations, we can then increase the dialogue so that we make sure that on a global level, everyone's part of the conversation,” she said.  If rules of the road aren't implemented in the U.S., it will push businesses and innovators offshore, she said.  “Regardless of whether you are pro or con on crypto … there's a sense among a number of members of Congress that something must be done,” she said.

Altcoins such as Cardano (ADA) have moved significantly in price breaking multiple resistance and climbing higher highs while ignoring a retrace. In today’s news, ADA has once again proven its potential to be small but mighty as the token appeared in the top trending crypto list on the crypto analytics platform StockTwits, surpassing Bitcoin (BTC), which comes second below ADA. ADA Obtains First Position In Top Trending Crypto List In a series of tweets shared by StockTwits, the crypto analytics platform ranked ADA as the most trending cryptocurrency on the platform, noting; “Cardano is also trending #1 on Stocktwits!.” At the time, ADA had a trading price of $0.3774, up by 11%, and a change of $0.0382. Aside from its position on StockTwits, ADA still appears to have significant potential as it still ranks higher on other platforms such CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap, competing with the other big dogs like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the rest. Related Reading: XRP Vs. Cardano (ADA), Which Is The Better Investment In 2023? CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap rank ADA as the eighth cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization, having a 1.2% dominance in the global crypto market cap. Notably, ranking second below ADA on StockTwits was BTC having a trading price of $23,195, up by 8.47% at the time, with a change of $1,810.42. Other cryptocurrencies at the bottom of the top 10 trending currencies include XRP and KRL, obtaining the ninth and tenth positions, respectively. The Crypto Market Price Outlook The bullish movement wasn’t only favorable to ADA but also to other altcoins that appear in the list of largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance coin BNB, and Ripple (XRP) have so far been a part of the uptrend. The top coin, Bitcoin, has made some significant movement since the beginning of the year, increasing by over 30% in the last 20 days and currently trading above $22,000. ETH and SOL have also been in a bullish trend since the beginning, with both up by 25% and 67%, respectively, in the last 14 days. ETH currently trades at $1613, while SOL is at $24.11 at the time of writing. Related Reading: BTC, ETH, DOGE, and ADA Are Undervalued, Report Indicates XRP began the year shakily, but the token had increased nearly 30% in the last 20 days and is currently with a trading price of $0.42 and still up by 2.7% in the past 24 hours. BNB, after surviving massive FUD late last year, has also increased 10% in the previous 14 days and currently trades above the $300 region. Overall, ADA is still one of the top gainers among the crypto tokens listed. Cardano has surged above 40% in the last 30 days. The sustained bullish trend shows the token still has higher highs to climb through before coming close to its peak and beyond.

Gemini's founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, have engaged in a Twitter war with Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis, over the $900 million owed to Earn customers. (DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.)  “It was our hope to avoid further reductions after this summer, however, persistent negative macroeconomic conditions and unprecedented fraud perpetuated by bad actors in our industry have left us with no other choice but to revise our outlook and further reduce headcount,” wrote Cameron Winklevoss, the president and co-founder of Gemini, in the internal message.

The amendments to the package, which is designed to ensure that traditional institutions issue enough capital to sustain lending levels, are set to be voted on by EU Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Tuesday. The text seen by CoinDesk asks the European Commission to propose a bill by June 2023, and says banks should apply a 1,250% risk weight to crypto exposures until the end of 2024.  Under global banking rules set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, that is the maximum possible deemed level of risk. It would, in practice, mean banks cannot gain any leverage, and must issue one euro of capital for each euro of crypto held.  “The existing prudential rules are not designed to adequately capture the risks inherent to cryptoassets,” says an explanatory text accompanying the proposed law. “This is even more urgent in light of the recent adverse developments in cryptoasset markets.”  The commission’s more detailed legal proposal, called for by the end of 2024, would have to offer a fine-grained analysis of the risks of different crypto assets, as well as liquidity requirements. Banks should also disclose their crypto exposure and risk management policies, the proposals said.

42411056,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBEWT,1674494198,The World's Best Crypto Policies: How They Do It in 37 Nations,"Crypto, in a sense, is a grand experiment that has no geographic borders. Bitcoin does not belong to the United States, China, Russia or to any company, government, or king. Bitcoin just is. That’s part of the appeal.  Crypto regulation, however, is a different beast. The laws stop at borders. Politics matter. Most countries are still struggling with how to handle this curious invention – tech that doesn’t cleanly fit into any one legal box. So regulation is its own sort of global experiment. Because every country is more or less doing its own thing, we can cast our eyes around the globe to see what’s working and what’s not.  This is piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Policy Week.""  As a thought exercise, what if we could cherry-pick the smartest bits of crypto regulation from around the planet? What could we emulate in the United States?  A few caveats: First, the U.S. has some unique regulatory challenges that make it trickier to crack. “We have a fragmented regulatory system. We don’t have a unitary regulator the way some jurisdictions do, which allows them to more easily respond to innovations that do not fit neatly into pre-existing product buckets,” says Timothy G. Massad, a nonresident Senior Fellow at Brookings who studies crypto regulation.  Read more: Jesse Hamilton - After FTX: How Congress Is Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto  This means that it might be unrealistic, from a practical perspective, to actually cobble together some sort of “greatest hits” of international policy. “A Frankensteining [or patching together of legislation] probably wouldn’t ever come to fruition,” says Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation and co-host of CoinDesk’s “Money Reimagined” podcast. And while Warren doesn’t think we could actually cobble together any global legislation, she does allow that, “I love the blue sky thinking, and I love the concept.”  So that’s the spirit of this experiment – more of an idea-sparker than a true road map. And it’s also true that nearly every expert I spoke with emphasized that there isn’t yet a silver bullet – from any country – that solves regulation. “It’s too early to tell,” says Michael Piwowar, executive director of the Center for Financial Markets at the Milken Institute. “We’re in the early innings.”  But aren’t early innings the best time to speculate, to challenge our perspectives and to have a little fun? (Crypto is also the only topic on the planet where “global regulatory policy” can somehow be seen as “fun.”)  So let’s take a quick look at what the experts think of the regulatory globe:  Japan  Warren likes Japan’s approach to non-fungible tokens (NFT). “I think the process is really thoughtful. I think they’re consulting the right stakeholders, they’re looking at creators,” says Warren.  Japan is experimenting in how to set up good regulation, says Ananya Kumar, associate director of digital currencies at The Atlantic Center, an organization that tracks international crypto regulation. “The Bank of Japan is basically setting up associations that will help them clarify what the crypto activities are, and what the economic function of those activities are,” says Kumar.  It’s also true that Japan has some history with crypto regulation. After the dramatic Mt. Gox exchange hack in 2015, the country established consumer safeguards, which is why JP Koning, writing for CoinDesk, argues that “Japan was the safest place to be an FTX customer.”  The European Union  “MiCA [the European Union’s upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets policy] is by no means a perfect piece of legislation, but one of the things that they did do right was focus on central custodial intermediaries,” says Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association. “I think that’s very positive.”  Massad also likes “pieces of MiCA,” specifically its approach to stablecoins. “I wouldn’t take it word for word,” says Massad, but “they’re bringing the stablecoin activity within the regulatory perimeter … as opposed to what we’re [in the United States] doing, which is trying to keep it out of traditional banking and otherwise leaving it to be regulated by state law.”  Read more: Jeff Wilser - 'What Was Gary Gensler Really Doing?': Rep. Tom Emmer on FTX, the SEC and What's Next for Crypto in Congress  The United Kingdom  Massad says that both the EU and the U.K. have a basic legal framework for electronic money. While it’s imperfect, it’s at least “a starting point and you can build from that.”  So why does that matter? “We [in the United States] need a basic e-money law. We don’t have one. We don’t have a good framework for regulating payments, generally,” says Massad, which is why regulation is subject to state laws “that have been on the books since the telegraph era.” So drafting an electronic-money legal framework, says Massad, would be a “precursor to dealing with the challenges crypto poses.”  Mexico  Kumar likes that Mexico is “looking at creating regulatory sandboxes” to more safely experiment with policy solutions. Kumar explains that “regularly sandboxes are an interesting way for countries to work with the private sector, form public/private partnerships, clarify the big questions about crypto, clarify the assumptions about crypto and then get to the business of regulating.”  She notes that sandboxing is controversial (here’s a primer), but says it provides a “contained environment to perform experiments.” In the case of Mexico, says Kumar, regulators have “gone back and forth on what should be the role of traditional financial institutions in crypto. Should they be allowed to trade in them? Hold them? Issue stablecoins?” They hope to find the answers in these regulatory sandboxes.  Canada  If regulatory sandboxes still seem a bit confusing, consider the case of Canada. Kumar points to Canada’s use of a sandbox to help figure out how to regulate exchanges. “Wealthsimple became the first exchange to get licensed in Canada, coming out of that regulation sandbox,” says Kumar. Or as the Canadian Securities Administrators explain on its website, the regulatory sandbox allows firms to “test their products, services and applications throughout the Canadian market on a time limited basis.”  Singapore  “Any time a country provides a framework for centralized custodial intermediaries to register with the government, and to be regulated, that tends to provide a pretty good environment,” says Smith of the Blockchain Association.  Or as Piwowar puts it, for fintech regulation in general, Singapore “sort of wants to be the London of Asia. They want to be the safe regulatory environment that gives a foray into Asia.” Piwowar notes that Singapore has a chief fintech officer (Sopnendu Mohanty), which is a signal to entrepreneurs that the nation is open for business. For someone who wants to set up a company “they made it one-stop shopping,” says Piwowar, “which is very different than in the United States.”  Switzerland  The Swiss approach is similar to Singapore, says Piwowar – which is why you have so many crypto companies and foundations based out of Zurich and Zug.  Then again, as a bit of added nuance, Sheila Warren suspects the crypto-friendly reputation of Switzerland is beginning to fade. Their model of making it easy to set up shop was “very, very smart at the time,” says Warren. So what’s the hitch? “We’re so far beyond that,” she says. “Now we’re talking about the activities that need to be regulated.” She considers the Swiss foundation model to be “the best-in-class at the time” and says it still remains useful, but cautions that it’s “for a particular kind of thing.”  Finland (Helsinki, specifically)  “If I’m really, really frank, the places getting it right are the places that are going slower,” says Warren. “This is such a complicated area.”  She cites Helsinki as an example of thoughtful experimentation that could later pave the way for sound policy. “I actually think what Helsinki thought about in terms of data and data trust and data government, is really important and really interesting, and people don’t ever talk about it,” says Warren.  Warren knows that she’s biased – she was part of the World Economic Forum team that led the project – but says that Helsinki piloted a “blueprint for data policy” as a way to think creatively about how to organize public data in a way that preserves privacy. Helsinki was “contemplating a time when blockchain is part of the architecture of a system,” says Warren, “and I think that’s forward-thinking. That’s what I’m looking for.”  Read more: Ben Schiller - 'We Haven’t Seen Anything Yet’: Introducing CoinDesk’s ‘Policy Week’  Thailand  Ananya Kumar describes Thailand’s new regulations as “more comprehensive than the rules in the U.S. and others,” and likes that they “have the beginnings of consumer protection regulation.” She says “consumer protection is really, really hard” but credits Thailand for the attempt.  She also appreciates the way Thailand has handled stablecoins because the country considers them “an e-money payment.” She added, “It’s legal, they allow for it, there’s a regulatory body that controls it and you can use it in payment.”  United Arab Emirates  “They’re experimenting, and they’re trying new things,” says Michael Piwowar, referring to Dubai’s launch of VARA, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. “They want to be the leader not only in the Middle East, but also as a launching-off point for Africa and other places in the region,” says Piwowar. The UAE has set up zones that have common law jurisdictions, he adds, and “both Abu Dhabi and Dubai have been very successful at attracting businesses in financial services in general, and fintech in particular, and are now moving towards virtual assets.”  The Bahamas  As for the Bahamas, Warren says with a laugh, given the FTX fiasco, “Boom, done, let’s go home.

In his writing, Buterin notes that assuring privacy remains a big challenge for the ecosystem, and that “improving this state of affairs is an important problem.”  Stealth addresses are generated by wallets and muddle public key addresses in order to transact in a private way. To access these private transactions, one must use a special key called the ""spending key.”  Privacy has been a big concern for the Ethereum ecosystem, given that transacting on the blockchain is public. There are already some privacy mechanisms. One notable example, Tornado Cash, has limits, Buterin noted, saying it can only hide “mainstream fungible assets such as ETH [ether] or major ERC-20s.”  Stealth addresses would provide a mechanism to also add privacy protections to non-fungible tokens (NFT) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain names.  Toni Wahrstätter, an Ethereum researcher who also reviewed Buterin’s blog post, told CoinDesk: “Stealth addresses have great potential to be used in every transaction in which the interaction between two parties should not be revealed to the public.”  Wahrstätter emphasized the need for the stealth address system for the expansion of everyday crypto use: “In particular, think of donations or simply payroll checks,” highlighting that users may not want others to see their personal transactions on a public blockchain.  “For example, when I buy a coffee at the supermarket, I might not want the supermarket to know my employer, how much I earn and what I spend it on,"" Wahrstätter added. ""Stealth addresses are yet another, quite straightforward tool to increase the overall privacy in the network.”  Read more: Ethereum Upgrade Could Make It Harder to Lose All Your Crypto",POSITIVE,ETH | ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ENS,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/23/ethereums-buterin-proposes-stealth-addresses-to-enhance-privacy-protections,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c5ccebfbdfa943cbcc9155ea330e539806ad7bb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move followed the alleged co-mingling of assets at failed crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) and its sister trading firm Alameda Research, a dynamic that drove potentially billions of dollars worth of losses for customers. In addition, state-regulated firms will be required to disclose to customers how they account for customers' crypto by maintaining proper books and records, according to the release . The demise of FTX and the slew of bankruptcies that followed shortly thereafter have drawn increased regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry. Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda, admitted that she conspired with others to use billions of dollars of customers' funds from FTX while misleading lenders about the true nature of the companies' financial relationship. Hence why the NYDFS is demanding that firms separate customers' crypto assets from their own. Also, a so-called virtual currency provider ""is expected to clearly disclose to each customer the general terms and conditions associated with its products,"" the regulator said.

42388190,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR8b4P,1674493097,Checks VV Rouses the NFT Community From a Sleepy Winter,"When Jack Butcher created the Checks VV non-fungible token (NFT) collection earlier this month, his intention wasn't to earn lots of money or spark movement in the NFT space reeling from the effects of a prolonged crypto winter. The former advertising professional, who recently founded a creative agency called Visualize Value, welcomed a new baby with his wife in the leadup to the launch of his 16,031-edition NFT project on Jan. 3.  The project, inspired by the ubiquitous blue checkmarks used on social media to denote a verified account, has since ballooned in popularity, doing 1,820 ETH (about $2.9 million) in secondary sales on OpenSea at the time of writing. It has even spawned a number of derivative projects made by the NFT community, propelling the project to meme status.  ""It's just been nuts,"" Butcher told CoinDesk. ""The timing of this is so crazy but you can't control it.""  The Nashville-based artist began thinking about the project in 2021 at the height of NFT mania. ""When we were in the crazy hype cycle of NFTs in 2021, I was so interested in the technology because I'd been making art on the internet for two or three years prior and NFTs created a market that pretty much didn't exist.""  In March 2021, he released an artwork called ""NFTs Explained,"" which satirically depicts the difference between a JPEG and an NFT with a verified blue checkmark to denote authenticity. ""I've been stewing on that for some time,"" he said. That project sparked the idea for Checks VV, which Butcher says is an introspective on the evolution of authenticity on the internet.  'This artwork may or may not be notable.'  The concept of blue checkmarks representing verification was first introduced on Twitter in 2009 as a way to prevent notable figures such as politicians, brands and celebrities from being falsely impersonated online. Since then, the marking has become something of a status symbol across other platforms like Instagram and TikTok, denoting accounts with heightened authority and cultural significance.  Following Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition in October, the blue checkmark was put in the crosshairs and given new meaning. In the past, influencers and journalists had to apply for verification and prove their credentials in order to receive the coveted blue badge. In November 2022, the platform relaunched its Twitter Blue subscription, offering blue checkmarks to anyone that was willing to pay a monthly fee of $8.  The move was met with backlash from users who believed that offering verification for a fee defeated its purpose. Dozens of fake accounts impersonating influential figures began to pop up, wreaking havoc on the platform. Twitter Blue was paused and then was reinstated in December with additional safeguards in place, though the damage had been done. Many accounts that had long been verified on the platform, including those of journalists and policymakers, now came with a disclaimer attached to their blue mark: ""This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.""  ""Twitter has been the environment and the host for NFT culture,"" Butcher said. ""The notability that a checkmark denotes in the old world versus the new world is really where the idea came from.""  Checks VV fashions the verification checkmark into a colorful 8x10 grid. Auctioned off as an open edition, the piece symbolized that all that was needed to buy a checkmark was $8.  ""The intent of this piece is to capture a moment in time – the shifting context in which the process of verification takes place, in a society dominated by electronic culture and communication,"" Butcher wrote in his blurb about the project. ""The coveted checkmark that was previously a badge bestowed by institutions, is now a symbol that merely means the holder can afford it and is prepared to pay for it.""  ""If no one is verified, everyone is verified. If no one is notable, everyone is notable.""  Butcher said that the project has been perceived as both a critique of centralized authority and as a commentary on the degradation of veracity on the internet. But neither interpretation is necessarily the right or wrong one, he explained: ""People interpret it differently because the symbol is so ubiquitous.""  Creating a cultural movement  Despite its stylistic simplicity, the project has continued to gain popularity following its launch. According to OpenSea, the project's floor price peaked on Jan. 17 at 0.38 ETH, or about $600 – a 7,400% increase from its starting price of $8. Some Checks with notable edition numbers have even sold for way above the floor price. On Jan. 20, Checks 1 sold for 11.111 wrapped ETH (roughly $18,000 as of writing).  The NFT community has been quick to embrace the project and its cultural significance, modeling a number of derivative projects after the project's motifs. Blank Check, an open edition project created by jehoseph.eth, depicts the verified symbol on a blank bank check, while Checks Mate, a fixed mint, positioned the check mark on a chess board.  ""I absolutely love it,"" Butcher said of the memefied collections based on his creation. ""I'd like to think that a couple of years ago, some of the things that I made during the one-of-one season had an impact or made the rounds. But never did anything get remixed to this degree.""  He credits many factors to the success of his project, including his already-existing network of supporters of his Visualize Value agency and the continued evolution of his idea through derivative projects.  ""People feel like they own a part of [Checks] by making something new,"" he said. ""It has made the whole thing that much more compelling.""  In addition, he touted his transparency regarding his artistic process along with the simplicity of the project's mint mechanics.  ""I think one thing that people underestimate about the lower cost open edition, or just more accessible ways to get your art out there, is that it builds a distribution channel like nothing you've ever experienced before,"" he said.  ""It maybe feels more in line with the ethos of Web3 that has maybe been in conflict with a lot of that behavior in the space for so long,"" he added. ""The sort of utopian narrative of Web3 has been a little disconnected from the reality of it.""  Expanding the Checks ecosystem  In the weeks since the project launched, Butcher has been working to expand the premise of the original pieces and continue to build its cultural legacy.  ""The question we are trying to answer is: Are checks more desirable if they are harder to get?"" he wrote on Twitter on Jan. 8. ""We can find out by incentivizing a reduction in supply.""  Loosely inspired by Damian Hirst's NFT project The Currency, Butcher has decided to introduce a burn mechanic that allows holders to remove their edition from circulation and trade it in for an on-chain original featuring unique art and a smaller number of checks. Burning two original NFTs featuring 80 checks will turn them into a 40-check NFT. Then, burning two 40-check NFTs would create an original 20-check NFT, and so forth. At the end of the experiment, there is a possible supply of three black check marks – which would require the burning of 4,096 original editions to create.  ""The option you have as a holder is to determine the journey that your piece goes through,"" Butcher explained. ""The speculation is that people will have to coordinate to make that happen because obviously, it'd be a Herculean amount of effort and spending to get to accrue that many NFTs to burn.""  So far, Butcher said that Check collectors are figuring out creative ways to move the project forward.  ""People have been reaching out about getting access to their contracts to set up trustless [decentralized autonomous organizations] to pool checks together,"" he said.  On a higher level, the gamification of the project is a reflection of its source material, exploring the exclusivity of the blue checkmark and the status achieved when obtaining it.  ""The idea is to make art that reflects the behavior of the crowd,"" Butcher explained. ""[Blue checkmarks] used to be so elusive and such a divider and I think that represents the spirit of Web3, crypto and NFTs that resonate with me – this idea of ownership, authorship, provenance.""  ""A decentralized network can say something is notable, not an institution,"" he concluded.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/23/checks-vv-rouses-the-nft-community-from-a-sleepy-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a775ecbe4c00288ed690d820e6b819ae32775fa4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The use of cryptocurrencies pegged to the U.S. dollar is expected to rise again this year, four regional crypto industry leaders said during the first Spanish-language Twitter Space hosted by CoinDesk en Español.  “In Latin America, the countries with the highest levels of inflation are the ones that run the fastest towards cryptocurrencies,” said ​ Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Ledn, a Canada-based lending platform with more than 125,000 users, half of whom are based in Latin American countries. “In 2023 stablecoin adoption will hike because inflation is going to be much higher amid macroeconomic turbulence,” he added.  The World Bank late last year said it expected 2022 inflation in Latin America to close out at 14.6%. While the institution anticipates the rate to slip to 9.5% in 2023, that level remains elevated. According to a recent report published by JPMorgan, inflation in Latin America will remain above most central banks’ comfort zones this year. The region accounts for some of the world’s highest inflation rates.  “We have seen a huge increase in the use of stablecoins, which grew from 2021 to 2022,” said Daniel Vogel, co-founder and CEO of Bitso, a crypto platform that operates in Latin America with more than six million users. He projected that the usage of stablecoins in the region will increase not only as a store of value but also as a tool for transactions.  In a study entitled ""New Payments Index 2022,"" Mastercard showed that more than a third of Latin Americans said they have made an everyday purchase with a stablecoin, compared to just 11% of those responding worldwide.  “It wasn’t a bad year for adoption at all,” Sebastián Serrano, co-founder and CEO of Ripio, a digital asset platform with more than 4.5 million users. “We saw a lot of institutional adoption, and much more stablecoin trading volume in 2022 than in 2021, a lot of corporate accounts and big projects done.”  Latin America was the seventh-biggest crypto market, according to Chainalysis' 2022 annual report, and five countries in the region were part of the Top 30 ranking.  Mariano Di Pietrantonio, co-founder and head of strategy at Maker Growth, a team dedicated to the expansion of MakerDAO, said that a lot of progress is being made in licenses for the issuance of stablecoins worldwide.  “I think that one of the star products in 2023 will be stablecoins pegged to currencies from emerging markets such as Latin America and North Africa, because they are very large markets that are precisely the ones that use stablecoins daily without speculative purposes,” he predicted.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Marina Lammertyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/23/latin-american-stablecoin-adoption-expected-to-grow-amid-high-inflation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f0a76184ff536660760fd19b12ab9531a9f9ea20-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7931759,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517148,1674489621,Is Litecoin (LTC) Expecting A Pullback Before Soaring Again?,"The Litecoin price has shown bullish sentiment over the past week once it bounced off the $81 resistance zone. Over the last 24 hours, the altcoin jumped by 2%, and in the past week, the LTC price gained close to 6%. As Bitcoin continues to trot upwards and is now eyeing the $23,000 price mark, other altcoins have reflected the same price sentiments. The technical outlook of the Litecoin price has depicted that accumulation shot past the overbought region just when Litecoin breached the $81 price region. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Whales Go On $1.4B Buying Spree Demand for the coin remained steady between the $81 and $88 price levels, respectively. As Litecoin traveled above the $88 price zone, the coin started to display a price correction. Going by the indicators, Litecoin continues to remain heavily bullish on its chart, with another chance of a price retracement. Bullish momentum has gained strength since it moved past the $86 price mark, which is why a move to the $90 mark was swift and easy for Litecoin. Historically, the $93 resistance mark has acted as a pullback region for the coin. LTC might reach the $93 level over the next trading session if Bitcoin continues to surge. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LTC was trading at $91 at the time of this writing. Over the past couple of weeks, Litecoin has pierced through several resistance levels. The coin faced stiff resistance at $81 and has been rallying since crossing that level. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $93; this will act as a crucial price mark because LTC can experience a pullback before it tries to breach the $106 resistance mark. On the other hand, if Litecoin fails to remain above the $88 support line, it would lead to sellers exceeding buyers, causing the altcoin to fall to $80 and then $71. The amount of LTC traded in the last session was red, which signified that there was a fall in the number of buyers. Technical Analysis LTC hovered around the overvalued zone, which indicated that there would be another price correction before it started to trade upwards again. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stood at the 70 mark, which indicated that the asset was overbought. A fall from the overvalued zone can drag the price of the asset below $88. Litecoin continued to depict extreme bullishness as the price was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line. This meant that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. The coin was also above the 50-SMA and 200-SMA lines. However, the 50-SMA was above the 20-SMA, which is a sign of impending bearishness and indicates a price pullback. Buy signals for the asset started to show a decline, which meant that buyers might start to exit the market over the next few trading sessions. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates price momentum and reversal; it displayed receding green signal bars, which meant incoming bearish price action.

During an online launch, Dr. Chintan Vaishnav, dission director of AIM, thanked 5ire's leadership for working ""actively with ATL to do this blockchain module.""  The Indian government's partnership with 5ire is significant since the startup gained attention for raising $100 million in July to become, in the company's words, ""[the] world's first blockchain unicorn with sustainability at its core"" as it looked to align itself with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).  Since 5ire's product (its mainnet) has not been launched yet, developments around the organization remain of interest. The company said in July it raised the $100 million from U.K.-based conglomerate Sram and Mram in a Series A funding round.

In remarks made to lawmakers Monday, Panetta indicated the putative central bank digital currency won’t allow restrictions to be placed on how funds can be spent.  “The digital euro would never be programmable money,” he told members the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. “Central banks issue money, not vouchers.”  The ECB is currently one of around 100 central banks investigating a central bank digital currency, and is due to consider whether to go ahead later this year. Some observers have touted as an advantage the ability to limit onward use of a digital currency – for example as food stamps that can be spent only on essential goods, or paying taxes automatically. Others, including euro area finance ministers, are opposed, saying the ability to be programmed would override the function of money as a fully fungible asset.  There could be a single digital euro app to provide a “homogeneous look and feel” across the 20 nations using the currency, and it could also be integrated into existing proprietary banking apps, Panetta said.  Panetta also said the digital euro may not run on decentralized technology that underpins crypto assets such as bitcoin (BTC).  ""The views of many experts is that blockchain technology may not have sufficient power to be used to run such a huge system,"" he said. ""We are still discussing this.""  Panetta's statement generated an immediate backlash from lawmakers influential in the crypto field.

The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) reiterated its requirements for record-keeping as a number of crypto entities, including Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange, is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.  Former FTX management is alleged to have misappropriated customer funds, including to prop up the exchange's sister trading firm Alameda Research ahead of its collapse.

42411053,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBEMY,1674487092,'We Haven’t Seen Anything Yet’: Introducing CoinDesk’s ‘Policy Week’,"The fall of FTX changed the game for crypto in Washington, D.C.  As CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton writes today, Congress is ready to clamp down on the industry. Members there are shocked by the size of the crypto exchange's collapse, comparing it to the fall of the Enron energy company, and they’re embarrassed at being taken in by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and his political contributions.  For two years, SBF was crypto’s number one proxy in D.C., an educator and schmoozer who charmed everyone with his youth and scruffy look. He was the source, along with his FTX colleagues, of political funding for one in three members of Congress (196 senators and representatives), according to a CoinDesk investigation. That makes the impact of FTX’s fall in the Congress all the more powerful, Hamilton writes.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week.”  Many legislators gave their FTX money back or donated it to charity. Chastened by the failure, many of those 196 are markedly more critical of crypto.  They chide Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, for allegedly taking meetings with SBF but not interceding on FTX (and businesses like it). The pressure is on the regulator to use all the tools at his disposal to enforce securities law, with implications for exchanges that, according to the logic of Gensler’s statements on tokens, have been dealing in unregistered securities.  While some crypto lawyers complain about a lack of “regulatory clarity,” others point to Gensler’s repeated statements that “most tokens are securities.” If the SEC does start enforcement actions, then Gensler can reasonably tell the crypto industry, “I told you so.”  No bipartisanship  FTX’s collapse has led to a noticeable uptick in partisanship. During the bull run, there was some ideological comity on digital asset issues. Now Republicans and Democrats are split on the meaning of FTX and SBF and how to regulate crypto.  On one side: Democrats (some, not all) say SBF’s misdeeds are a function of crypto, highlighting its supposed laxness and irresponsibility. How else do you explain the rise of a hugely rich and powerful man-child? “The collapse of one of the largest crypto platforms shows how much of the industry appears to be smoke and mirrors,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.), a longtime crypto critic and standard bearer for this wing, has said. On the other side is the idea that SBF is an old-fashioned fraud, the sort seen many times before – and, therefore, not a function of crypto. “Sam Bankman-Fraud and his colleagues are as old as finance. This is about centralization. They controlled everything,” Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the new House Majority Whip and firm crypto champion, tells CoinDesk’s Jeff Wilser in an interview for “Policy Week” today.  In this analysis, decentralization (rather than the conglomerate FTX was trying to build) is the way forward, because it obviates undue financial centralization and power.  “What we’re talking about is decentralization,” says Emmer. “That’s what blockchain and crypto rides on. That’s what it’s all about. Open, permissionless, transparent.”  Republicans “blame crypto’s problems on humans,” Hamilton says, “while cautioning against slowing down innovative technology.”  Democrats say crypto is an “untamed beast that steals people’s life savings and doesn’t seem useful for anything,” he added.  House action  The focus from the House of Representatives side, led by Patrick McHenry (R-N.C. ), chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, will be on “market structure guardrails” and “stablecoin guardrails,” Emmer says.  Ron Hammond, director of government relations at the Blockchain Association, expects action within weeks. “It‘s going to come a lot sooner than folks think,” he tells Jesse Hamilton.  Meanwhile, U.S. regulators are gearing up to take on the crypto industry, armed with the rules and resources they already have and angling Congress for more. Gary Gensler is under pressure to wield a mightier stick (and explain meetings he had with SBF). That’s likely to lead to a higher volume of enforcement actions, some lawyers have told CoinDesk, perhaps even against some of the industry’s biggest players.  Joshua Ashley Klayman, a New York digital assets attorney who has worked closely with the SEC, told CoinDesk that, while the volume of SEC enforcement has been increasing, it hasn’t included actions against the big kahunas of the space. “In terms of SEC enforcement, if people think we’ve seen it all, I think we haven’t seen anything yet. I think it’s just getting started because while we’ve heard repeatedly from Chair Gensler and others about potential enforcement against digital asset trading platforms, we haven’t really seen that enforcement,” she says. “SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said the ‘runway is getting shorter’ for platforms to come in and register. And if the runway’s getting shorter, then presumably eventually the runway is going to run out.”  The SEC is likely interested in exchanges for the important reason that they are where crypto touches retail, setting off investor protection concerns the SEC is obliged to consider.  The same sort of discussions are being held in many places around the world. The influence of FTX and SBF runs wide, befitting a company that wanted to bestride the world. We’ll publish reports from the European Union, South Korea, Japan, India, Singapore, Hong Kong and several other places as part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, which starts today and runs through Jan. 27.

The 16.16 million ETH figure consists of over 13.28% of the total Ether supply and represents $26.13 billion at current prices. As per the data, out of the 16 million ETH staked, about 11.408 million ETH have been staked through staking services providers such as Lido, Coinbase, and Kraken, among others – representing 70.86% of the total staked on the Beacon chain. According to the data, Lido dominates ETH staking with 29.3%, Coinbase controls 12.8%, while Kraken holds 7.6%, and Binance controls 6.3% of total staked. BeaconScan data shows that the number of active validators stands at about 503,702 while Nansen data shows that the number of unique staking depositors is about 93,800. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears $1,600 Level – Is The $2K Mark Hittable This Week? The Upcoming Shanghai Upgrade The rising number of staked ETH is an indication of the promising signals of Ethereum adoption and security. However, this may create pressure on the network’s core developers to speed up work to enable withdrawals to maintain balance on the network. While the staked funds are locked up within the network and get accrued yield, it will be impossible to withdraw until the network’s Shanghai upgrade, which is expected to take place in March. Many participants are expected to withdraw their staked ETH after the Shanghai upgrade. However, the withdrawals are anticipated to happen in stages and validators are to be rewarded for re-staking. The mechanism is expected to ensure a balance in the chain. The increasing amounts of staked ETHs are important as it makes it more difficult for an individual actor to attack the Ethereum chain. But since the majority of staked ETH currently belongs to large wallets, the phenomenon has drawn concerns that the chain is becoming too centralized. Developers are reported to be working on making the Ethereum network less centralized as some staking providers such as Lido appear dominating in ETH staking. Related Reading: If Any Crypto Will Reach $1 Trillion, It’s Ethereum, Not Bitcoin: Dragonfly Capital The amount of staked ETH has risen 16.68% since the Merge upgrade in September when Ethereum transitioned to today’s favorite staking system (proof-of-stake consensus mechanism) from its old proof-of-work energy-intensive crypto mining process.

While this shows a slight reduction in interest among traders, ETH’s price analysis shows a bullish market, which has been favoring the buyers as the price currently sees significant improvements. The buyers have been able to recover the price above $1,600. The recovery has been slow as there is still selling pressure within the market. The bulls and bearish are trying to capitalize on opportunities in the market.

42411251,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVcX,1674486247,What If Regulators Wrote Rules for Crypto?,"Regulators are in no hurry to write rules for crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have brought a combined total of more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto-asset market participants. Yet, neither agency has issued a single crypto-specific rule, and it is unlikely that they will change course any time soon. But what if the agencies decided to do so? What sorts of rules could they write using their existing regulatory authorities?  The SEC  Federal securities laws are principally designed to reduce information asymmetries between the issuers of securities and the investing public. When a firm elects to raise capital from investors by selling a security, the laws require the firm to make investor disclosures to minimize the informational disadvantage of outside investors. Additionally, the laws require exchanges, brokers, dealers and investment advisers who provide access to securities or securities-related advice to register with the SEC and adopt policies and procedures designed to protect investors.  This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week. Michael Selig is counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher.  The framers of the federal securities laws didn't have programmable crypto assets in mind when they drafted the laws. But the SEC has the statutory authority to issue rules that would make it possible for crypto assets and crypto intermediaries to operate within the contours of federal securities laws. The agency could start by writing rules to establish a workable framework for crypto-asset security issuances and exchanges.  Issuances  Crypto assets are network assets. Unlike firms, networks are generative. The value of a network derives from the applications, organizations and projects built on the network by its users. The developer of a network may opt to issue the network’s native crypto asset when publicly available information about the network is scarce to encourage users to join the network. Once a critical mass of users has joined and is participating in a network, the developer may no longer have an informational advantage relative to the users. At this point, investors in the crypto asset may not require the protections of federal securities laws.  It is unlawful to offer or sell a security without registering the offering or sale with the SEC, absent an exemption. The definition of the term “security” includes a list of financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, notes and investment contracts. Crypto assets most typically come within scope of federal securities laws when sold as part of an investment contract.  The term investment contract originates from “blue sky” laws designed to govern offerings of written contracts under which a person invests money with a promoter who promises to use the money to generate profits for the investor. In a 1946 opinion (giving rise to the so-called Howey Test), the U.S. Supreme Court defined the term “investment contract” for purposes of federal securities laws as a contract, transaction or scheme whereby an investor invests money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.  There is little mention of investment contracts in the SEC rules because before crypto assets came along, nobody knowingly intended to issue them. For decades, the SEC has brought lawsuits asserting that a contract, transaction or scheme should remedially be classified as an investment contract because it has the economic substance of a security. After the SEC started to bring these lawsuits against crypto-asset issuers, some crypto projects embraced the investment contract designation and attempted to issue these instruments in compliance with federal securities laws.  Read more: Mike Selig - 2023: The Year of Regulation vs. Decentralization  Lack of clarity  Crypto-asset issuers experimented with investment contract offerings under various exemptions from SEC registration, and one even registered an investment contract with the SEC. Others exclusively sold offshore in jurisdictions where crypto assets aren't regulated as securities. These issuers may have anticipated that the SEC would eventually write rules to make it possible for crypto assets to operate within the SEC’s regulatory perimeter. But the rules haven’t come, and these crypto-asset securities were left without a clear path to non-security status or liquid secondary markets in the United States.  Nonetheless, the SEC has recognized that crypto assets may evolve to shed their investment contract skin over time. In 2018, the then-current director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance expressed the view that a crypto asset may initially be offered or sold as part of an investment contract but may later be resold as a non-security. The following year, the SEC staff released a “framework” on crypto assets, indicating that, in some instances, a crypto asset “previously sold as a security should be reevaluated at the time of later offers or sales” to determine whether it remains a security.  This view is also expressed in SEC enforcement action settlement orders, which require the issuer to register a crypto asset as a security but provide that the issuer may later terminate the registration on the basis that the crypto asset is no longer a security. At least one issuer followed this approach by offering a crypto asset as a security and then later filing an exit report declaring the crypto asset to no longer be a security.  Another crypto project recently declared its crypto asset to have “morphed” from a security into software. But the SEC hasn't issued rules codifying an exemption from registration for decentralized network assets or a procedure for offering a crypto asset as a security and later determining that the crypto asset is no longer a security. Issuers that choose to take this approach remain at risk of an SEC lawsuit.  The SEC wouldn't need legislative authorization to exempt from the registration requirement offers and sales of network assets. The agency has broad authority to promulgate rules exempting transactions, securities and persons from registration. The SEC could, for example, condition such an exemption upon the issuer making periodic disclosures of material nonpublic information until the issuer reasonably has no informational advantage relative to users of the network.  SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has twice proposed rules that would create a “safe harbor” for certain crypto-asset issuers. Issuers that choose to rely on the safe harbor would be exempt from registering their crypto-asset offerings for a three-year period. Issuers that develop a sufficiently decentralized network within this time could declare the crypto assets to be non-securities. Peirce’s safe harbor offers a sensible framework that would protect investors while encouraging innovation.  Exchanges  State financial-services agencies were the first regulators to begin licensing crypto exchanges. These agencies reasoned that crypto assets are a type of monetary value and crypto exchanges are therefore money transmitters. The purpose of money-transmitter laws is to protect customer deposits from misappropriation and misuse and prevent money laundering. These laws are far less comprehensive than those applicable to securities exchanges. As a result, incumbent crypto exchanges are not designed to support crypto asset securities trading. Yet, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said that many such platforms are required to register with the SEC as a “national securities exchange.”  Despite Gensler’s call to action, there are no SEC-registered crypto exchanges today. This is because the standard crypto exchange operating model is the product of money-transmitter law requirements and isn't workable for a securities exchange. Moreover, significant SEC exemptive relief would be needed for any securities exchange to list crypto assets under current SEC rules.  Many SEC requirements present roadblocks for potential registrants. For example, securities exchanges may offer trading only in registered securities. Very few crypto assets available today are registered, and some of the most popular are non-securities. Additionally, securities exchanges are open only during defined hours and close on national holidays, whereas crypto assets trade in global markets that never close.  Read more: Most Influential 2022 - The ‘Good Cop and Bad Cop’ of US Crypto Regulations  Among the most critical issues is that retail investors cannot trade and hold securities directly on securities exchanges as is typical with crypto exchanges. Instead, they are required to place orders and hold assets with an SEC-registered broker-dealer, which acts as an exchange “member.” Broker-dealers are permitted to trade and hold crypto-asset securities if they were offered and sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or exemption. Broker-dealers, however, effectively cannot trade or custody non-security crypto assets.  The SEC has broad authority to issue rules exempting crypto exchanges, brokers and dealers from the requirements of federal securities laws. Targeted amendments to the SEC’s national securities exchange and broker-dealer rules would make it possible for crypto-asset securities to trade more broadly and in a manner that comports with federal securities laws.  The SEC could conditionally exempt national securities exchanges and broker-dealers that solely offer crypto assets from SEC requirements that are incompatible with current market structure if there would be no investor harm. It could also permit these intermediaries to offer non-security crypto assets and crypto-asset securities that weren't registered or offered under an exemption, provided that the intermediary does so in accordance with SEC requirements.  The CFTC  The CFTC’s authorizing statute chiefly governs the trading of derivative instruments, such as futures and swaps. The CFTC has declared certain crypto assets to be commodities subject to its general anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority, but it generally lacks the authority to issue rules providing oversight for commodity spot markets.  Nonetheless, the CFTC has jurisdiction over offerings of margined, leveraged or financed commodity spot trading to retail investors. Outside the U.S., most crypto exchanges allow retail investors to trade crypto assets on margin. Within the U.S., crypto exchanges must register with the CFTC as a futures exchange to offer crypto-asset margin trading to retail investors. Additionally, a CFTC-registered futures commission merchant must provide the margin, and these transactions must be cleared by a CFTC-registered clearinghouse. The CFTC issued interpretive guidance clarifying the circumstances under which an exchange can qualify for the narrow “actual delivery” exemption from these requirements, but few, if any, have managed to find a way to do so.  The CFTC could take the pen on a lighter touch set of rules for crypto exchanges that offer margin trading but don't offer futures or other types of derivatives. As CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham has pointed out, the agency has the authority to do so. Many crypto exchanges wish to offer margin trading in the U.S. but are intimidated by the requirements that they register with the CFTC as a futures exchange, offer margin through a futures commission merchant and integrate with a clearinghouse.  Moreover, these exchanges would likely require significant no-action relief from the agency to offer margin trading under current CFTC rules. A new set of rules for crypto-asset margin exchanges would allow these platforms to innovate and grow responsibly under the CFTC’s regulatory umbrella.  ***  It is a shame that the SEC and CFTC are unlikely to write new rules for crypto-asset markets any time soon because there is a lot they could accomplish using their existing authority. But calls from policymakers to regulate through rulemaking rather than through enforcement offer a glimmer of hope for the future.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Michael Selig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/23/sec-cftc-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48cda2ea9c58c59c893425048453d167aed00619-5224x3483.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fundraising closed in October, Tribes founder and CEO Hish Bouabdallah told CoinDesk during an interview last week, putting the round deep into a crypto bear market that put pressure on the investment landscape but ahead of the industry-shaking implosion of centralized exchange FTX. The strengthening of Web3 infrastructure to attract more Web2 natives and general users has emerged as a trend in the post-FTX investment environment.  “Web3 primitives for co-ownership and collective action are transformative, but few people can make sense of the existing products and processes required,” Bouabdallah said in a statement provided to CoinDesk. “In order to realize the full promise of Web3, nailing collective action is absolutely essential. Our approach to embed it directly into group chat makes these powerful and newly possible Web3 actions understandable and accessible to the masses.”  Tribes group wallets let people co-own and manage digital assets while communicating directly through the wallet rather than through an outside messaging service such as Discord or Twitter. The use cases include decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – token-gated communities built around as shared mission – or something as simple as family members wanting to co-contribute to the joint ownership of property. Wallets can send, receive and hold digital assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), memberships and currencies. Sending or spending assets from the group requires a group vote for approval.  Available in the Apple (AAPL) and Google app stores, Tribes app users connect through their Coinbase Wallet.

The shadow fork occurred at 10:40 coordinated universal time (5:40 a.m. ET), according to Parithosh Jayathi, DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation.  In the hours since the fork happened, there were some glitches with Ethereum's nodes that use Geth clients, according to Marius Van Der Wijden, a software developer at the Ethereum Foundation. A client is a software that is used by nodes that operate the blockchain, and Geth is Ethereum's most popular client.  Van Der Wijden told CoinDesk that Ethereum developers are working on syncing Geth clients back up with the rest of the network.  In preparation for Shanghai, which will unlock staked ether (ETH) withdrawals, the protocol will be undergoing a series of test forks that copy the data from the main network (mainnet) to a testing environment.  A shadow fork is a smaller test fork that focuses on some of the changes that need to happen before Shanghai eventually occurs on the main protocol. Ethereum used several shadow forks for testing ahead of last year’s big shift to a proof-of-stake network, known as the Merge.  During this latest shadow fork, developers focused on creating a testing environment for staked ETH withdrawals as well as improvements to reduce gas costs.  This shadow fork brings the much anticipated Shanghai upgrade closer to the Ethereum mainnet, expected in March 2023.  The public testnet for Shanghai will also go live in the coming days. Ethereum developers launched a “Shangdong” testnet for Shanghai in November 2022, but deprecated it so that they could start a newer enhanced testnet.

42421075,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRcj,1674483240,"'What Was Gary Gensler Really Doing?': Rep. Tom Emmer on FTX, the SEC and What's Next for Crypto in Congress","Just two letters. That was the tweet, gm, tweeted Representative Tom Emmer on Dec. 6, 2021, instantly endearing himself to Crypto Twitter. For those unaware, “gm,” short for “good morning,” was widely used as a cheery greeting during the bull run – morning or night – in something of an inside joke.  This interview is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week.  How did Emmer learn to speak crypto?  “I’m a white-haired, 61-year-old guy whose pop culture references end in 1988,” Emmer says. The “gm” idea came from a staffer.  But in a deeper sense, the tweet suggested that the Minnesota Republican – who is now the House Majority Whip – understands crypto and has emerged as one of the space’s most powerful advocates. The Blockchain Association’s Kristin Smith referred to him as a “steadfast crypto champion.” He held the first cryptocurrency town hall. He introduced the bipartisan Securities Clarity Act “to provide a path to regulatory certainty for digital assets”; he’s co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus; and the Minnesota Reformer dubbed him the “Crypto King of Congress.”  So why is he so bullish on crypto? “It’s not about crypto,” says Emmer, clarifying that it’s about what crypto is facilitating – the movement towards Web3, or what he prefers to call the “ownership economy.”  “That goes to everything I believe in,” he says, “which is restoring the individual’s right to make his or her decisions about what they want to do in the marketplace. Or who they want to do it with. Or how they want to get that done. And they don’t have to have a middleman.” Ultimately, this is about “restoring liberty and choice to individuals.”  These words are awfully abstract, so Emmer gives a quick hypothetical example. It’s worth printing in full: “You’ve got some aspiring entertainer who, right now, puts her content on a YouTube platform. And guess what? She derives no income from that whatsoever. No value. Unless she sells ads directly to that website.  “In the new world that we’re going to, she can put her content out there as a non-fungible token … that others will pay something to experience or use, and that will go directly to her. Maybe it’s pennies, but you might have the next Aretha Franklin, who all of the sudden has a seven-figure number of views at a penny or two each, and you see where this goes. I think that’s exciting. I think that’s fair. And you don’t need intermediaries for all these things.”  For those who follow the space closely, Emmer’s example is not particularly groundbreaking. It’s standard stuff. This is the now-familiar “directly empower creators” argument that Web3 enthusiasts have long championed. But in a way that’s exactly the point, and it’s astonishing: Emmer is not some hoodie-wearing founder on a crypto panel; he’s the Majority Whip and one of the most influential power brokers in the United States.  And he speaks crypto.  For this we can partially blame CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey. When Emmer first joined Congress in 2015, a staffer gave him the book “The Age of Cryptocurrency,” co-written by Casey and Paul Vigna (both then of the Wall Street Journal). Emmer devoured the book and asked for more. He says that even though he’s a “61-year-old fart who likes to read books the old-fashioned way,” he has seven kids (ages 33 to 21) so he’s always “watching the new stuff they’re dealing with.”  Now Emmer wants to ensure that this “new stuff” of crypto is not smothered by regulation. What happens next with congressional legislation is perhaps crypto’s most burning question of 2023 and Emmer is at the tip of the policy spear. But he demurred from sharing his strategy because “I’m not going to step on [incoming chair of the Financial Services Committee] Patrick McHenry’s toes.”  But he did give us a few nuggets. “I think you’re going to see a lot of bipartisan work to get to the bottom of why the [Securities and Exchange Commission] wasn’t doing his job,” he says, referring to the FTX meltdown. “What was [Chair] Gary Gensler and company really doing?” He describes Gensler as “very arrogant” and speaking “from the mountaintop,” and then “we find out that they’re working with a fraudster that bilked the people out of billions of dollars … Republicans and Democrats are going to be involved with that.”  As for legislation? “We’re going to focus obviously on legislation, and I think it’s going to be to place key guardrails around the industry,” says Emmer. “Market structure guardrails. Stablecoin guardrails. Things like that.”  He’s happy to share what legislation he does not want to see. “The bill … that they were trying to roll out last fall is not the answer,” says Emmer, referring to the Digital Commodity Consumer Protection Act. And as for Senator Maxine Waters’ (D-Calif.) stablecoin bill? “That’s a hard no,” says Emmer. “The United States government should not be in the digital dollar business. The U.S. Treasury or the Federal Reserve – neither one of them should be in the banking business for private citizens.”  Emmer can read the room. He knows the FTX meltdown has made crypto a tougher sell to his colleagues in Congress, and he’s not happy about it. “That crook, Sam Bankman-Fraud, has turned us back a couple of chapters,” says Emmer, who used the word “fraud” or “fraudster” nine times in our conversation, clearly trying to separate the sins of Sam Bankman-Fried from any inherent problems with crypto.  The critique of this approach, of course, is that the loosey-goosey world of crypto enables and emboldens bad actors like Bankman-Fried, and he is symptomatic of a much larger problem. And that consumers need more protection. And that FTX is less of an outlier and more of a systemic failure. Or as the Senate’s chief crypto cryptic, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), tweeted on Nov. 9, “The collapse of one of the largest crypto platforms shows how much of the industry appears to be smoke and mirrors.”  Emmer directly responds to this line of thinking. “The senator from Massachusetts, who shall go unnamed, is arguing that this is a problem with crypto itself,” Emmer says. “No. Sam Bankman-Fraud and his colleagues are as old as finance. This is about centralization. They controlled everything.”  The roots of the problem, says Emmer, is that Bankman-Fried was incentivized to set up shop in the Bahamas, which let FTX’s execs hide their shenanigans. For this he partly blames, well, Sen. Warren. “They [FTX] manipulated this thing from offshore because of people like the senator from Massachusetts, who will not get anything of substance done so that we can have this investment, this innovation, right here in this country. It’s [a crypto legal framework] got to be in the Caribbean, for goodness sake, when stuff should have been here all along.”  In other words, the dithering of Congress meant that companies sought refuge in the Bahamas, and when that happens all bets are off. So the trick to preventing a future FTX, argues Emmer, is not smothering regulation, it’s an embrace of transparency and decentralization. “What we’re talking about is decentralization,” says Emmer. “That’s what blockchain and crypto rides on. That’s what it’s all about. Open, permissionless, transparent. Anyone can see what’s going on in the blockchain. It literally is the answer, the antidote, to Sam Bankman-Fraud and all of the scammers that have come before.”  Emmer then leans into his critique of Sen. Warren, who he still declines to refer to by name. “It’s all about power, I think, for the senator from Massachusetts,” says Emmer. “She likes the way things are. She’s afraid of people taking back control of their own situation. She wants government to be involved in all of it. Because guess what? That gives her power and authority over the very people she claims to want to champion.”  So because of this negativity and the FTX fiasco, says Emmer, he needs to “go back to with certain members of Congress … and re-educate them that Sam Bankman-Fraud is just your classic, manipulate … scam that existed with cash.” This should be addressed “within the regulatory mechanism of our government, and it needs more oversight. And by the way, you have the laws in place. If people like Gary Gensler would do his damn job, we might not have some of these issues.”  And in the meantime, Emmer remains optimistic about crypto or Web3 or “the owner economy” in general and private wallets in particular. “I love them. I love them. I don’t care if you’re a Republican or Democrat, you should never take those away. It’s about the privacy. It’s about the ability to self-direct. It’s about the ability to take the government out of my life when I want the government out of my damn life.”  For better or worse, Emmer does not personally own any private wallets that HODL crypto. He has accepted donations from crypto organizations and companies – including a U.S. unit of FTX, according to a CoinDesk report, making him among the one in three members of Congress who accepted FTX contributions. However, he says he has never purchased any cryptocurrency. “I made that decision a few years ago,” says Emmer, because it could be politically damaging. “This place [Congress] is such a hellhole … If I suddenly have crypto that I’m invested in, people will [say], “Oh, he’s not interested in the policy, he’s making something off this.”  This means that he, personally, has been bullish on crypto since 2015 but he missed the bull run.  As he says now, “My wife is still mad at me.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/23/rep-tom-emmer-crypto-and-web3-the-ownership-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2667f11b25c9fbdab055c66d4c02a430a27f1f34-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the market's ability to absorb large offers at stable prices remains weak, meaning the price could suddenly reverse.  FTT has rallied nearly 150% this month as a bull revival in the broader market triggered a short squeeze in the battered cryptocurrency. FTT crashed 96% in November, hitting a low of 81 cents as its parent exchange, headed by Sam Bankman Fried, went bust.  Data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko Research shows a balanced order book in Binance's FTT-BUSD market, with the number of buy orders for 20,000 FTT or more now matching similar-sized sell orders. BUSD is a stablecoin developed in partnership between Binance and Paxos and is backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars, according to its official website.  ""When looking at the transaction-level data, we can see that price takers have been placing large market buy orders at the same pace as market sell orders – so it looks fairly balanced right now at current levels,"" Clara Medalie, research director at Kaiko Research, told CoinDesk.  Price takers are entities that remove liquidity from the order book by taking available orders. Price makers create orders and wait for them to be filled, injecting liquidity into the market.  Medalie added that ""overall liquidity remains very thin, so if a wave of selling starts, then it could push prices back down.""  Liquidity is often measured by a metric called the 2% market depth – a collection of the buy and sell orders within 2% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices. The greater the depth, the less likely that an influx of large buy or sell orders can influence the going market price.  FTT's 2% market depth in Binance's FTT-BUSD pair remains flat at around 100,000 FTT. That's equivalent to just about $210,000, as of this morning, Kaiko tweeted. Before FTX's crash, the 2% depth stood well above 6 million FTT.  The low-liquidity malaise is also evident from tepid trading volumes.  ""On the price taker side, trade volume is very low apart from a few spikes into the 8-10 million range. Low liquidity has likely made it a lot easier for FTT's price to surge by a few opportunistic buyers, which then draws in traders trying to offload their FTT,"" Kaiko said in a tweet thread.",NEUTRAL,FTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | FTT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/23/ftt-order-flow-fairly-balanced-after-150-rally-but-liquidity-remains-thin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7549041cb6a900f9c70ccd03857c0568510546b-1284x678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Targeting crucial crime facilitators such as crypto exchanges is becoming a key priority in the battle against cybercrime,"" Europol said, citing transactions in multiple crypto currencies including bitcoin (BTC), dash (DASH) and litecoin (LTC), as well as U.S. dollars and Russian rubles.  The company's CEO, financial director and market director were all arrested in Spain, as well as one additional individual in Cyprus and one in the U.S., Europol said, after the U.S. Department of Justice announced it had shut down the Hong Kong platform and taken founder Anatoly Legkodymov into custody in Miami.

Last Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network formally labeled the company a “primary money-laundering concern,” a designation that usually cuts off a business off from the global financial system.

42411259,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVt4,1674481471,Can Banks Issue Stablecoins?,"Stablecoin regulation is one of the most controversial topics in cryptocurrency. Recent reports from U.S. regulators as well as the Biden Administration have warned that stablecoins could threaten financial stability, although many are skeptical of that claim. Previous proposals sought to regulate transparency, issuance, and licensing of stablecoins, although no legislation has yet been passed.  This debate, however, may be missing an important point: The issuance of redeemable notes by private banks, in paper or electronic form, appears to already be legal in the United States.  Thomas Hogan is a senior fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research. He was formerly the chief economist for the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, & Urban Affairs. This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week.”  Private banknotes were widely used as a medium of exchange for the majority of U.S. history. Prior to the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913, banks issued paper notes redeemable for the equivalent amount of some asset, usually gold. Even after the end of the gold standard in 1933, notes issued by national banks continued to circulate, dwindling to around $20 million in circulation by 1970.  Private banknote issuance is common practice in several countries today. In Hong Kong, Scotland and Northern Ireland, for example, private banks issue paper notes redeemable for their own local currencies. Private bank-issued currency is legal in dozens of countries around the world.  See also: What Is a Stablecoin?  Electronic stablecoins are the modern analog to paper banknotes. Stablecoins are crypto tokens whose value is tied to some other asset, such as the U.S. dollar. The total market value of the top four U.S. dollar-linked stablecoins is currently around $135 billion, which although quite large, is modest compared to the U.S. monetary base of about $5.4 trillion.  Most stablecoins are redeemable on demand, just like deposits in a checking or savings account. Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, promises redeemability in U.S. dollars. Some stablecoins, such as the dai (DAI) token, require more than 100% collateralization to help ensure token holders’ funds are secure even if the collateral value falls.  Legal authority  In 2001, U.S. Department of the Treasury economist Kurt Schuler found that the issuance of private banknotes is technically legal in the United States. The tax on state-chartered notes, which effectively prohibited the practice, was repealed in 1976. The laws preventing issuance by nationally chartered banks were repealed in 1994, although a semi-annual tax (totaling 1% per year on the value of notes in circulation) would still apply.  If Schuler is correct, then no law or regulation currently restricts the issuance of private banknotes. A white paper from the Clearing House, a bank association, supports this view, noting that stablecoin-related activities “clearly fall within the existing legal authority of banks.” Further, they write, “no legislative change is required to permit banks to issue digitized deposits” in the form of stablecoins. In 2012, I calculated that U.S. banks could earn billions in profits by issuing their own private notes.  For regulatory purposes, redeemable stablecoins would presumably be treated like banknotes or other non-interest-bearing liabilities. They would not be subject to reserve requirements, which apply only to transaction accounts and were lowered to zero in 2020. Prior to 1994, national banknotes were required to be fully collateralized, but that requirement is no longer in effect.  See also: Circle CEO: US Stablecoin Legislation Is ‘Lowest-Hanging Fruit’  Bank-issued stablecoins would also not be subject to insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which applies only to specific types of accounts, such as checking and savings accounts.  State-chartered banks would likely enjoy more regulatory flexibility in issuing stablecoins. States such as New York have deterred the crypto industry with restrictive regulatory regimes, but others including Wyoming have welcomed cryptocurrencies, and might provide a regulatory environment amenable to stablecoins.  Another question is whether anti-money laundering (AML) laws, such as know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, would apply to bank-issued stablecoins. Some might argue that holding a stablecoin is like having a bank deposit, but a more accurate comparison is to personal or cashier’s checks, which require only the check writer to have an account at the issuing bank. Signed checks can be passed on to other users who eventually redeem them. AML and KYC laws do not apply to intermediate holders of the check, only the check writer and possibly the redeemer. This standard should apply to stablecoins as well.  The Clearing House’s white paper points out other areas where compliance might be necessary, such as with Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, but none that would prohibit stablecoin issuance.  Limited oversight  In the short term, regulators have only limited authority to increase regulatory scrutiny of bank liabilities. Some regulatory changes, such as increasing reserve requirements, can be made immediately. However, changing regulations specifically to alter the treatment of stablecoin liabilities may require new rules to be created through the official notice-and-comment process, which often takes years to complete.  Prior legislative proposals sought to clarify the legal requirements for issuing stablecoins. Sen. Bill Hagerty’s Stablecoin Transparency Act, Sen. Pat Toomey’s Stablecoin TRUST Act and the Responsible Financial Innovation Act by Sens. Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand would each have required stablecoins issued by depository institutions to be fully collateralized and redeemable for U.S. dollars.  See also: The Niche Application of Stablecoins Is Not a Bad Thing / Opinion  While it may be good policy to require that stablecoins be backed by liquid assets, future proposals should acknowledge the current legal status of stablecoin issuance, rather than creating unnecessary or redundant issuance regimes.  As the law currently stands, no legislation appears to be necessary for banks to issue stablecoins. The practice is not legally prohibited. If Congress or regulatory agencies wish to prohibit the issuance of stablecoins by U.S. banks, they must pass new laws or regulations to do so. Congress can help clarify the current legal ambiguity and ensure that safe, transparent stablecoin issuance continues to be allowed.",NEUTRAL,USDT,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Thomas Hogan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/23/can-banks-issue-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f606a7600acb8dbe58842daa46e074c225163575-5149x3432.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411253,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVfq,1674481222,Privacy Is a Human Right – and the 118th Congress Must Defend It,"As the 118th U.S. Congress begins, the stakes surrounding our privacy rights have never been higher. For decades, lawmakers have utterly failed to defend everyday people – much less those who are most vulnerable online – from dangerous encroachments into our digital privacy. Just last week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) revealed a massive surveillance dragnet of people who use services like Western Union to send remittances.  Now, both sides of the aisle begin 2023 having painted a target on the backs of privacy-preserving software projects and those who build them. This attitude poses a real danger not only in the U.S., but for people across the globe. It’s time for software projects that value privacy to get organized.  Lia Holland is the campaigns and communications director, and and Eseohe Ojo is a campaigner, at Fight for the Future. This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week.”  This is why our organization, Fight for the Future, has released a letter signed by 40+ open-source, decentralized and/or privacy-preserving projects that asks lawmakers to protect a pro-privacy future. Signatories on this letter include Tor, The Blockchain Association, Nym, Protocol Labs, Proton, Zcash, Tutanota and Mysterium.  We have four simple asks:  Constitutional and human rights protections, both on- and offline  The first ask to Congress is straightforward: Do more to protect our constitutional and human right to privacy. The right to privacy has always been a foundational principle of the U.S. There are express or implied rights to privacy in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth amendments to the Constitution. Even the legal victory that established a constitutionally protected right to code was about encryption, meaning it was about privacy. Unfortunately, that decision did not settle the law.  Threats to the right to code and the right to privacy are inextricably entwined, especially as more of our lives move into digital spaces where our rights are ignored and invasive surveillance is the default.  See also: Elizabeth Warren's New Financial Surveillance Bill Is a Disaster for Privacy and Civil Liberties / Opinion  To seriously and vigorously defend these rights, many in Congress would need to shift their thinking on the simple act of writing code – to recognize that this freedom is core to the technologies that empower democracy and must be defended. That also means our representatives must analyze the potential impacts of new laws and regulatory action on First Amendment protections when drafting new legislation. This should be the rule, not the exception.  Champions of the right to privacy and the First Amendment must stridently oppose any actions that criminalize building and using privacy tools or the simple act of writing or running code. Proactively, lawmakers should consult those most impacted and consider new legislative shields to defend our rights against the corrosive powers of short-termism, political theater and poorly drafted bills, as well as from Big Tech and Finance’s lobbying pressure.  Support the decentralization of power  Secondly, Congress should be unwavering in its efforts to address power imbalances and support decentralization of power. The argument of the surveillance state is simple: safety demands sacrifice. If you aren’t doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about. This thinking is deeply flawed because surveillance concentrates power – and surveillance states and human rights abuses go hand in hand.  From East Germany pre-reunification to current-day Russia or Saudi Arabia, to communities across the U.S. and U.K., the dangers of surveillance are clear. We’ve seen the results in the news, in history books and in dystopian fiction like “1984.” The more you are surveilled, the more power state and corporate actors have over your life.  This issue compounds as decisions about our basic digital infrastructure and online safety are made unilaterally by out-of-touch billionaires. Surveillance capitalism pervades our digital economy, causing market forces to constantly erode user privacy by design.  See also: Chelsea Manning: Crypto’s Privacy Problem Depends on Improving Its Technology  It’s beyond time for Congress to invest in creating more resilient digital infrastructure, where power is decentralized and decisions are made by users, not the market or Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. There are a host of strong legislative actions that would break Big Tech’s monopolistic and oppressive stranglehold on the internet.  Lawmakers should also be analyzing regulations for their potential to unintentionally entrench Big Tech by, for example, making compliance so expensive or business so risky that only the largest players can afford to exist.  Solutions and paradigm shifts often come from the margins, and the open source software community’s experimentation in community-owned and governed alternatives to Big Tech should be encouraged and embraced for the liberatory activity it is.  Champion privacy technologies  Another obvious action Congress should take is championing privacy technologies, such as end-to-end encryption (E2EE). Although our situation is dire, all is not lost when it comes to our digital privacy. Open-source developers and activists have done wonders for the human right to privacy by creating and promoting access to tools like end-to-end encryption and zero-knowledge proofs.  Privacy innovations can restore trust in our communications and financial activity. Yet, many prominent lawmakers are reacting to these tools with condemnation. They find surveillance appealing as it proposes a convenient, if facile, way to combat real problems such as illegal activity, tax avoidance and sanctions dodging: surveil everyone at all times.  See also: Zero-Knowledge Cryptography in 2023: The Year Privacy Becomes Practical / Opinion  It’s not worth it. This backsliding on our constitutional rights puts open source development of privacy tools in danger. Proposed legislation has effectively required that software developers put surveillance tools in their projects if they could ever possibly be used to host or transact in cryptocurrencies.  These moves from Washington, D.C., have shocked the open-source software community, and chilled the creation and use of human rights preserving tech. Instead, lawmakers must reverse course on pressuring companies not to implement or to break end-to-end encryption and other privacy-preserving technologies, and speak out when the FBI and Attorney General try to paint privacy as nothing more than a shield for criminality.  Pass data privacy laws  The final demand is the passage of long-overdue data privacy legislation. Even as Congress undermines privacy in practice, a nonpartisan majority of lawmakers understand that privacy is important to their constituents. Many conservatives, especially libertarians, want to protect private spaces from government intrusion and censorious corporate spying. Meanwhile, marginalized communities, which often lean left in their politics, need private spaces to protect themselves from authority figures who would harm or deplatform them to score cheap political victories.  Various forms of digital privacy legislation, including some that are well-intended but deeply flawed, have swirled around the U.S. Capitol for years. There has been no groundswell of support for these bills, and none have come close to passing. It’s time to change that and show Congress’ commitment to protecting constituents from surveillance, identity theft, discrimination and harassment.  Lawmakers need to work with key stakeholders including marginalized communities, anti-surveillance civil society organizations and open-source developers of privacy tools to craft a new privacy standard for everyone that includes severe crackdowns on the titanic government and commercial surveillance operations that have infected our internet.  See also: Why Crypto Should Support the American Data Privacy and Protection Act / Opinion  As these demands make abundantly clear, the value of privacy and privacy tools is not abstract. The essential nature of protecting our data is easily illustrated by any basic analysis of real-world threats to activists, journalists, abuse survivors and everyday people around the world. At home, the “penumbra” rights to privacy based on landmark U.S. Supreme Court cases are now being rolled back. Roe was overturned, and the threat to same-sex marriage established in Obergefell was severe enough that Congress passed the Respect for Marriage Act. Today, more – not less – marginalized people are at risk of being criminalized by surveillance-enhanced state laws and state police action.  The U.S.’ role in protecting and preserving human rights around the world should rank among the greatest prides of democracy. Traditionally, the U.S. has used diplomatic pressure to promote freedom of association, organization and access to information. All of these freedoms rely on privacy as a backstop against arrests and violent crackdowns.  It’s not just diplomatic pressure that allows the advancement of human rights, it’s privacy tools that are often created and run in the U.S. In October, for example, over 18,000 people in the U.S. ran Tor Snowflake to help internet users facing censorship in countries such as Russia and Iran privately circumvent it. Tor was created by MIT graduates and U.S. Naval Research Lab personnel to prevent tracking, surveillance and censorship worldwide.  Failure to protect the right to privacy will hurt democracy and, particularly, marginalized communities both in the U.S. and abroad. A growing number of technology and thought leaders are urgently calling on the U.S. Congress to return to the principles of the Constitution, as well as their own innate understanding of the harm surveillance has wrought among their core constituencies.  Everyday people should never be treated as criminals, guilty until government and corporate invasions into their privacy prove them innocent – and the time for our legislators to take action is now.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Lia Holland,  Eseohe Ojo",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/23/digital-privacy-rights-protection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb91f522b50463896027288e6037d9a39f937ae2-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411049,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBECd,1674480698,After FTX: How Congress Is Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto,"If familiarity breeds contempt, the crypto industry should strap on a helmet in these opening days of the 118th U.S. Congress because lawmakers know the digital assets sector a lot better than they once did.  The shine is off the bitcoin, and those pre-partisan days of educational hand-holding by industry boosters have been strangled by current events. In a potentially momentous session in which U.S. lawmakers could shape how virtual assets are used around the world, crypto’s drama will overshadow all of it, starting with hearings focusing on the FTX failure.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week.  Before FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried was charged in an epic fraud that two of his former lieutenants said he orchestrated, he was Washington’s favorite proxy for the crypto world. As one of the industry’s chief ambassadors on Capitol Hill, the approachable CEO spent an awful lot of time with lawmakers, so his unmasking as an alleged villain is that much more damaging for the industry.  Not only that, he and other top FTX officials were a shocking wellspring of campaign funding in the last election cycle, giving directly to no fewer than one in three members of Congress, a recent CoinDesk analysis showed (and indirectly to many more). Now it’s up to those 196 senators and representatives to explain what they’ve done with those contributions from Bankman-Fried and others.  In the room where it happens (to borrow the earworm from ""Hamilton"") there’s a stench of crypto’s misdeeds. And the industry won’t have to wait long before getting the first sense of where it now stands in Washington.  “It‘s going to come a lot sooner than folks think,” said Ron Hammond, director of government relations at the Blockchain Association, who expects the relevant committees to get back into investigating the FTX debacle within the next few weeks. “They’re ready to hit the ground running.” Crypto is among topics getting the most immediate attention in the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee. The industry is finally earning the priority status it desperately wanted, but for the wrong reasons.  Headline-conscious lawmakers – many of them recipients of those FTX dollars – will get some early messaging off their chests before legislating begins in earnest. And the political party divide will become starker, dulling the conspicuous joy the industry once felt from how nonpartisan the work was.  The new Republican line: Blame crypto’s missteps on the humans. Don’t indict the innovative technology!  From Democrats: Crypto is an untamed beast that steals people’s life savings and doesn’t seem useful for anything.  ""The collapse of FTX definitely has an impact on the way people in the Congress think about this,” Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) told CoinDesk TV earlier this month.  U.S. lawmakers have so far produced no significant laws to establish crypto oversight, despite a number of legislative efforts last year that fizzled out. To change that in this newly divided Congress, the Republicans will have to acknowledge their House majority is razor-thin, and they’ll need some cross-party partnership to move anything in the next two years.  “Nothing is going to happen unless it’s bipartisan,” said Parker Hamilton Poling, a former executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee who was once chief of staff for Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the new chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.  “Nothing spurs legislation like a crisis.""  McHenry is “very eager to engage” with Democrats on crypto issues, and Poling – now a partner at Harbinger Strategies – said the congressman will have to figure out some common ground with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), because any legislation “is going to take some effort on both sides.”  See also: Congress' FTX Problem: 1 in 3 Members Got Cash From Crypto Exchange's Bosses  Brown made some noise late last year with remarks that put him in the crypto-suspicious category, though he also penned a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying he was serious about sitting down to figure out a whole-government approach to regulating the sector.  Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, thinks this will be the “Crypto Congress” because the industry’s need for oversight “hits the trifecta of interest, understanding and urgency with lawmakers,” she said. “Crypto will become an unavoidable issue for members of Congress, and when it comes to crypto policy there is something for everyone.”  Stablecoin bill possibility  So far, the strongest legislative progress has been on overseeing stablecoins such as Tether's USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC, which are pegged to the U.S. dollar as a means of keeping their values steady. Regulators universally agree stablecoins, the lifeblood of crypto trading and decentralized contracts, need unimpeachable reserves and disclosures to avoid threatening the wider financial system.  Lawmakers from both parties also agree, and they were ironing out the final details on a House bill when the clock ran out last year.  “The stablecoin effort is very much still alive,” Poling said. “They were very close, and they might pick that back up.”  Because that work was “almost to the finish line,” Himes, a member of the House committee that worked on the stablecoin bill last year, is predicting Congress can get it done.  ""Where we've really got some momentum is on the question of stablecoins, and that may be the place to start, with tens of billions of dollars of stablecoins trading every day,"" he said.  Hammond cautioned that the industry shouldn’t expect it to happen at a lightning fast pace. He said he’ll be looking for any legislation in the latter part of 2023.  Where we've really got some momentum is on the question of stablecoins.  Crypto lobbyists are pinning a lot of hope on McHenry’s brand-new crypto subcommittee and its leader, Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), who is seen as a good negotiator with a deep financial knowledge.  The Senate and House agriculture committees have also been active in trying to come up with bills, often focused on giving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) new powers to regulate crypto – including the spot market for crypto commodities such as bitcoin.  A fundamental question still looms over the industry: What makes a crypto token a security or a commodity? Congress’ answer would likely require a bill that cuts across the financial and agricultural committees in both chambers, and would call for a lot of different lawmakers to come together.  Some previous bills have tried to solve the problem, such as a wide-reaching, bipartisan proposal last year from Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) While it was a conversation starter – as designed – its ideas remain theoretical, and neither lawmaker has the heft to push it through even one of the several committees that would need to approve it.  On that score, the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act from the leaders of the Senate Agriculture Committee enjoys more of an advantage, but it hasn’t achieved liftoff. One of that bill’s most prominent champions was Bankman-Fried, now sitting in his parents’ Palo Alto house wearing an ankle monitor. His aggressive lobbying on its behalf may have left a black mark on the effort. Decentralized finance (DeFi) advocates worried an early version of the bill would stomp on their business model, though that language seemed fluid late last year. The bill’s authors have said they still intend to get the effort to the Senate floor.  Old legislation would have to be reintroduced in this new session, and the recent consensus among lawmakers and regulators is that FTX justifies a rethinking of how Congress is approaching the industry. Wherever the negotiations range, they’ll have to clear the bottleneck of Brown’s Senate Banking Committee, which Hammond said is “going to be the hold-up for most things.”  See also: The Revolving Door Is Good for Bitcoin  And the burning crypto question – security or commodity – remains ""sort of in a vapor lock,"" Himes said, with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler jamming the debate with his assertion that his agency already has all the authority it needs to get the industry in line and he just needs to keep punishing the companies into compliance. Lawmakers need to decide whether he’s right or whether new powers need to be authorized, Himes said.  Despite crypto’s reputational mess, the industry’s current self-inflicted crisis could have a silver lining: Major financial legislation tends to rise from smoldering ruins. In the vein of the Enron failure (which drove new accounting laws) and the 2008 housing meltdown (which spurred the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010), Bankman-Fried’s unintentional legacy could be legislative.  “Nothing spurs legislation like a crisis,” Hammond said. “FTX could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.”",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/23/after-ftx-how-congress-is-gearing-up-to-regulate-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4713433876435bccec27914bebe1cf5320ab450-3600x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7924850,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517136,1674479427,Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Whales Go On $1.4B Buying Spree,"On-chain data shows Bitcoin whales have accumulated $1.4 billion in the asset during the last two weeks, a sign that could be bullish for the coin. Bitcoin Whales Added 70,000 BTC To Their Holdings In Two Weeks As pointed out by an analyst on Twitter, BTC whales have been showing accumulation behavior recently. The relevant indicator here is the “Bitcoin Supply Distribution,” which is a metric from on-chain analytics firm Santiment that tells us which wallet groups in the market are holding what amount of the crypto right now. Wallets are divided into these groups based on the total number of coins they are holding currently. For example, the 10-100 coins cohort includes all wallets that are carrying a balance of at least 10 and at most 100 BTC. The Supply Distribution metric for this specific group would then show the combined number of coins that are present in these wallets at the moment. Related Reading: This Metric Suggests Bitcoin Could Be In Danger Of Another Selloff In the context of the topic at hand, the wallet group of interest is the 1,000-10,000 coins group. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for this Bitcoin cohort over the past month: The value of the metric seems to have observed some rise in recent days | Source: Ali on Twitter The 1,000-10,000 coins wallet group is an important cohort for BTC as it includes addresses belonging to the whales. Since the balances of these investors are huge (the lower and upper bounds of the range convert to $22.9 million and $229 million, respectively, at the current exchange rate), movements from this cohort may sometimes have visible effects on the price of the crypto. As can be seen in the above graph, the amount of Bitcoin being held by the whales was going down during December, suggesting that these humongous holders were selling their coins then. At the start of this year, however, the metric bottomed out and since then this cohort has shown net accumulation behavior. Interestingly, while this buying from the whales has taken place, the price of the crypto has observed a sharp rally. Around five days ago, this BTC rally saw its first significant pullback and from the chart, it’s visible that these investors participated in some selling around it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Keeps Pushing, Why BTC Price Increase Isn’t Over Yet In the last few days, however, the 1,000-10,000 BTC wallet group has again done some buying as their Supply Distribution curve has once more spiked up. Following this latest accumulation, BTC has again caught a sharp uptrend as the price of the coin has now surged to almost $23,000. In all, these whales have added more than $1.4 billion worth of coins to their holdings in the last couple of weeks, taking their total holdings to 4.62 million BTC ($105.8 billion).

Mean reversion is a theory used in finance that suggests asset prices tend to revert to their long-term mean or average level.  According to Bernstein, the mean reversion of crypto still has room to run, and so the broker advises caution about being bearish at current levels. Bitcoin in its entire history has never had two consecutive years of negative returns, it added.  Although the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and the bankruptcy filing of crypto lender Genesis has been negative, “the potential overhang on the liquid crypto markets has receded,” the report said. Much of the expected selling pressure has been in illiquid private crypto assets, it said.  The risk of an immediate sell-off in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has also receded as creditors and Digital Currency Group, which owns Grayscale, Genesis and CoinDesk, negotiate a settlement, and with all the relevant situations now under court settlement, the “public crypto markets seem to have felt some relief from any forced selling narratives.”  It is unlikely, however that this is the start of a sustained rally, because this is more “capital internal to crypto (sidelined stablecoins) being deployed,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote. “We have not yet seen any new capital allocations to sustain this rally.”  Regulatory news from Hong Kong, which is looking to allow crypto trading licenses for some assets, has also contributed to positive sentiment in the crypto market, the note added.

On Feb 2023 dYdX will unlock a massive amount of dYdX ( DYDX-USD ) tokens for investors and employees, which makes dYdX token a hard pass, a sell, or even maybe a short candidate in our book. The supply will double very soon, on February 2nd. Then by next year it will 5X which will dilute the value of each token even more. We can't fully recommend shorting this token because we don't know with certainty what the investors and employees will do with their liquid tokens. But, we will explore the possibilities and probabilities in this article and let our readers make up their minds on that possible path. Our base case is a game theory optimal decision by the collective group of investors to sell ~50% of their total token interest and keep the rest for 10 + years. dYdX has some of the worst tokenomics in the whole of crypto. In our six years of crypto, we have witnessed many projects implode due to bad tokenomics all the while being decent projects to say the least. On many occasions we have used these events to make a profit. dYdX has the second largest inflation in all of crypto and, us being economists, just can't fight the obvious supply and demand imbalance and likely price destruction via dilution or sell pressure that is about to occur. What is dYdX? dYdX is a decentralized exchange, also referred to as a ""dex,"" that offers perpetual futures contracts on its semi-decentralized exchange, which are comparable to other centralized exchanges such as Binance, or the previous FTX exchange (R.I.P). Using dYdX, traders can short-sell tokens, increase exposure by longing with leverage, or earn interest/rewards on deposited tokens. The long term objective of the protocol is to create a fully decentralized derivatives exchange where no one person or entity, not even the development team, can have control over the protocol's core functions. The exchange is named after the differential equation for derivatives notation in calculus ""dY/dX"" also known as Leibniz's notation. The exchange was founded in 2017 and went live in 2019. dYdX token's initial coin offering ((ICO)) was on September 9th 2021. dYdX was minted as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain along with the initial dYdX protocol running on Ethereum. Now, dYdX protocol is operated on the Layer-2 (L2) StarkEx network which has lower fees and faster transactions for users, relative to L1 Ethereum while still benefiting from Ethereum's security as all other ETH L2 chains do. But, recently dYdX announced intentions to build ""dYdX V4 as a standalone blockchain based on the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint Proof-of-stake consensus protocol."" Side note : dYdX platform users might be eligible for StarkEx token airdrop if there ever becomes one, as it is a major project without a token and dYdX is the biggest platform to use StarkEx technology. But, I digress, away from air-drop hacking my fellow crypto degens . dYdX token utility and the lack thereof The token dYdX has two uses as of now. First, it is a governance token which gives the holder the right to participate in the governance of the protocol and the future changes and budget allocations. Second use for the token is discount utility. Token holders get discounts on trading and can also stake their tokens to earn interest. Tokens which have some sort of utility, can be classified as utility tokens and have a better chance of passing the "" The Howey Test "" and not being classified as securities. dydx.exchange/ Popular misconception is that the dYdX token holders are entitled to profit sharing from the platform fees similar to a shareholder in a traditional exchange. As of now, that is not the case, nor are there any plans to make it so, as this would most likely make the token be then classified as a security according to the Howey Test, and entangle the exchange which is domiciled in San Francisco, California, in a slew of legal issues at least in the US. Even if the revenue was shared with the token holders the exchange is paying out more in rewards than is making in revenue. Additionally, the daily average users count is only 1,650, which doesn't scream popular. messari.io/report/state-of-dydx-q3-2022 Funding and Token Supply According to CrunchBase, the total funding amount was $87M over 4 funding rounds. crunchbase.com/organization/dydx On the DefiLlama chart below, we can see the market capitalization during Series B &C funding rounds, release of the dYdX token on August 3rd 2021, as well as the trading competition. Current market capitalization sits around $200M, but we can see in the chart below it has been as high as ~$1.3B during the height of the 2021 bull market. defillama.com/protocol/dydx?showMcapChart=true Total and circulating supply of dYdX token dydx.community/dashboard According to the dYdX website there were a total of 1 billion dYdX minted, which are to be distributed over a five year period, starting on August 3rd 2021. Current circulating supply is 144,108,083 according to the dYdX community dashboard above . Token allocation breakdown 50.00% of the supply will go to the community (500,000,000 DYDX) 25.00% will be used as trading rewards (250,000,000 DYDX) 7.50% will be set aside for retroactive mining rewards (75,000,000 DYDX) 7.50% will be assigned for liquidity provider rewards (75,000,000 DYDX) 5.00% will go to a community treasury (50,000,000 DYDX) 2.50% will be dedicated to users staking USDC to a liquidity staking pool (25,000,000 DYDX) 2.50% - to users staking dYdX to a safety staking pool (25,000,000 DYDX) 27.73% will be set aside for investors (277,295,070 DYDX) 15.27% will go to founders, employees, advisors, and consultants (152,704,930 DYDX) 7.00% will be kept for future employees and consultants of dYdX (70,000,000 DYDX) docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/start-here/dydx-allocations Can more dYdX tokens be minted? Yes, five years after launch, a maximum inflation rate of 2% per year can be implemented to give the community and developers resources to continue contributing to the dYdX protocol. In 2026 dYdX community can decide via governance vote using their tokens voting power, what the maximum supply of new tokens to be minted would be, up to 2%. docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/start-here/dydx-allocations Incoming Liquid Supply Tsunami February 02 2023, marks a massive unlock period that starts off with a bang and continues to add fuel to the fire every 30 days. Unlock dashboard (token.unlocks.app/dydx) This means that on Feb 2, 2023, the supply goes from 144,110, 278 plus additional 150M to a total liquid supply of 290,000,000. And if the current market value of $207.5M would be divided by the new diluted supply of 290M, it would imply a token price of ~ $0.70 (207.5/290), which is about 50% lower than price of $1.44 at the time of writing. But wait - there's more. Daily trading rewards unlock every month and adds ~3.8 Million tokens of liquid supply 1.1 million liquidity provider rewards once a month Liquidity module : 378,788 each month Safety module : 378,788 each month Monthly total: 5.6 million And that's not all. The liquid supply keeps increasing by ~40M extra tokens every 30 days on top of the 5.6M monthly. So by this time next year on Jan 16, 2024 the total liquid supply will be 711,363,637. 711,363,637 / 144,108,083 = ~5. See chart below for the unlock cliff coming in February and the influx of tokens that follows, reaching 1 billion by 2026. dydx Unlock schedule (token.unlocks.app/dydx) So over the next 12 months the liquid supply will be 5 X from today . Are you interested in that much dilution? Because we are not . By this time next year the dilution adjusted token price by today's market cap. is about $0.3 ($207M/711dYdX= $0.29 dYdX), which coincidentally is about the average cost investors paid for their tokens. Game theory Game theory arguments suggest that it would be in the best interest of the investors to at least recoup their initial $87 million, while they can. This would imply a sell pressure of about half the unlock amount. This action would bring the risk down to 0 while still allowing them to bet on the long term success of the project. Rule #1 of investing is: DON'T LOSE MONEY. We will come back to the rule#1 when we discuss dYdX's biggest investor. Why investors might not sell despite the incentives Some investors won't sell no matter what the game theoretic incentives suggest for a few reasons: 1. Reputation Institutional reputation - is everything in the investment world, and if the VC gets a reputation as a fund that just dumps as soon as they can, they will shut themselves out of the future opportunities as they would be labeled as a bad partner. (However, this doesn't mean they can't sell a little bit as part of their risk management strategy.) 2. Liquidity Investors that sell large amounts, don't use regular exchanges like us plebs to transact. They often find a buyer and make the transaction privately off the public exchange. Public markets in crypto do not have deep liquidity that institutional investors require to transact. If they were to sell a large amount on the open market, the price would free fall. And a free fall price is not in their interest; unless, they also have a short leveraged derivative position. 3. Philosophy Some investors have a very strict investment philosophy in early industries and companies. These investors often don't sell for a minimum of 10 years or sometimes the hold duration is forever. This might seem like a crazy condition to lock yourself into but, if we look at successful giant tech companies, in almost every scenario holding for 10+ years is the best and most profitable decision even if 80-90% of the portfolio companies go to zero. The few winners in the portfolio that are Google, Amazon, or Tesla pay for all the losses and still give a massive profit to those that held long term. (However, this doesn't mean they can't sell a little bit as part of their risk management strategy.) Because of the reasons discussed (Reputation, Liquidity, Philosophy), we are uncertain how investors will act during the unlock, but we suspect that some will take the opportunity to cash out and color up. Cash out their dYdX tokens at a profit of 100-500% and buy currently depressed blue chip coins like ETH and BTC or even Coinbase shares ( COIN ) in the case of Brian Armstrong the CEO of Coinbase, a noteworthy investor in dYdX. Long term we still project a likely game theoretic outcome since the unlock will continue for the rest of 2023 and on. The risk/reward only gets worse for current holders and those that get the unlock in early February as the supply tends towards 1 billion tokens and quintuples in the next 12 months alone, to over 700M. Our call is to sell dYdX tokens and not look back. At least until you can get in at the VC price of $0.3 per token. Why some investors should sell With their $87M investment the VC investors secured 27.73% of the total supply, a whopping 277,295,070 dYdX tokens. With some high level differential multivariate calculus below, we can see that their per token average price comes out to ~ $0.31/dYdX. Complex math >> $87,000,000 / 277,295,070 dYdX = ~ $0.31/dYdX Most of the investors listed have a personal or firm philosophy on taking profit. Most of them subscribe to a long term investment philosophy as tech investors should. In order to adhere to rule #1 of investing and to play with house money, so to speak, the investors will need to sell at least $87M in value to recoup their initial investment. dYdX has a who's who of a crypto investors list. Most notably Andreessen Horowitz (a.k.a. A16Z), Polychain, Paradigm (the largest investor at $65M), and sadly also the now blown up hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital (a.k.a. 3AC). dydx investors list (crunchbase.com/organization/dydx/investor_financials) The noteworthy investors above are known for long term holding. A16Z has an insanely impressive IPO or acquisition exit list . 3AC is now bankrupt, so their dYdX assets will most likely be liquidated to pay creditors. 3AC gives us one forced selling domino in the sell pressure that may manifest once the tokens are unlocked. 4 rounds of investors (crunchbase.com/organization/dydx/investor_financials) Matt Huang, a co-founder of Paradigm, said on twitter that the venture capital company wrote down its entire stake in the collapsed FTX exchange. A total of $290 million was invested by Paradigm in a collection of companies run by former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. As the biggest investor in dYdX Paradigm might need to find some liquidity via their dYdX token unlock, in order to clean the pie off their face from the FTX debacle. Therefore, we will assign a non-zero probability that they will sell some and maybe a lot of their dYdX tokens once they unlock. Will employees sell? Unlike investors who may have a long term investment philosophy or reputations to maintain, the employees are not held to a similar standard. We believe it is a prudent financial decision to diversify one's wealth from a single source. The employee's current income/salary is dYdX dependent, their future investments should not be also dependent on dYdX. There are many risk factors in both investing in, and work for, a crypto project. It would be prudent risk mitigation to have a diversified portfolio of crypto or other assets, so we will assume that at least some employees understand the risk and are going to act rationally with the knowledge of incoming inflation to cash out some of their risk. Final words Will the unlocked tokens hit the open market and add sell pressure? We don't know for sure how the employees and investors will act with their unlocked tokens, but the risk is too high to bet against human nature and game theory, so that is why we have liquidated our dYdX position in 2022 and do not plan to add any in 2023. Fully diluted token value after the big February unlock is $0.70, which is 50% lower than today's price, and gives us a fair margin of error even if the investors have diamond hands, that the market will reprice the token based on market capitalization dilution alone. Some investors have gone bankrupt like 3AC and their tokens might hit the market as creditors get what they are owed; which might be one and only domino needed to kick off the run for the exit. The biggest investor has taken a huge hit lately and might be a motivated seller if the LPs start asking tough questions about their lack of due diligence with the recent FTX disaster. We strongly believe that the risk of holding or buying dYdX tokens is too high given the dilution and lack of utility or value the token represents currently. If and when dYdX is able to share exchange profits with the token holders we will be willing to consider investing, but until that time, we do not see the value in this governance/discount token to justify the doubling of the market capitalization with abhorrent tokenomics. Lastly, there is a large short elephant in the room. Any one of the investors or employees could open a short leveraged derivative position and dump their newly unlocked tokens on the open market to make a massive profit on their derivative position. Something like this might not fly in traditional markets, but in crypto this sort of manipulation isn't far-fetched, nor illegal.",NEGATIVE,ICO,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4571591-bear-case-for-dydx-token?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7923294.jpeg

Voting on the proposal, which was floated by OxPlasma Labs, ended Sunday night with about 20 million tokens cast in favor of the move. “Our proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain has passed the 'Temperature Check' with 20M votes 'YES' and 6,495 $UNI voters (the biggest number for the whole Uniswap Governance History),” Plasma tweeted.  Uniswap, like other decentralized exchanges (DEXs), relies on smart contracts to match trades and supply liquidity between traders. It locks up over $3.4 billion worth of various tokens across five blockchains, with V3, the latest iteration, commanding $2.6 billion of that figure, according to DefiLlama.  Plasma said the move is warranted because BNB Chain, a blockchain closely linked to the centralized crypto exchange Binance, has a large and growing user base, providing a potential new market, as well as high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a suitable platform for Uniswap’s DEX services.  “Deploying to BNB Chain could help Uniswap to tap into the growing popularity of DeFi (decentralized finance) in the Binance ecosystem,” developers wrote in that proposal. “BNB Chain offers unique features such as staking and cross-chain support that could enhance Uniswap v3’s functionality.”  Among several other benefits, Plasma added a move to BNB Chain could attract at least $1 billion in additional liquidity from the BNB Chain ecosystem as well as “1-2 million new users.”  Plasma is expected to float a final proposal outlining the move in the coming weeks.",POSITIVE,UNI | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | UNI | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/23/uniswap-poll-shows-80-support-decentralized-crypto-exchanges-move-to-bnb-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7cb697e8f66775d5ebc70087f60688d11a9ec8e2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7922085,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517120,1674475253,Coinbase Exec Accuses Binance Of Crypto Price Manipulation,"The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance was in the crossfire of critics for a long time after the FTX collapse. In particular, there was harsh criticism because of an opaque proof of reserves issued by the auditing firm Mazars, which paused the cooperation with the exchange shortly thereafter. Over the turn of the year, however, the criticism has become quieter and Binance has disappeared from the spotlight as DCG and Genesis became the crypto industry’s biggest headache. But Conor Grogan, Head of Product Business Operations at Coinbase, presented new serious allegations against Binance today. In a Twitter thread, Grogan wrote that there is a “pattern of Binance front-running over 18+ months.” He found Binance-connected wallets which were buying $900.000 RARI seconds before the listing and dumped them minutes after. He also found an incident where around 78,000 ERNs were bought between June 17th and 21st and sold immediately after the listing was announced. The same thing was done with TORN, where “hundreds of thousands were bought and sold right after the announcement.” Related Reading: Bearish Indicator: Are Big Players No Longer Interested In Bitcoin? Another example is the purchase of RAMP, worth more than $500,000, of over multiple days, “before sending it to Binance minutes after the listing announcement. Assuming they sold it was a ~100K payday.” Grogan explained: I found all of these via looking at the original wallet’s OKX deposit address and looking at the other counterparty wallets. Not great opsec by them. I just started digging in so there might be more examples. According to the Coinbase exec, the front-running could have a variety of causes. Most likely, according to Grogan, is insider MNPI (Material Nonpublic Information) which is operated by a rogue employee who is connected to the listing team and has details of new asset announcements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Keeps Pushing, Why BTC Price Increase Isn’t Over Yet Another explanation could be a trader finding a leak in an API or test trade exchange. In any case, regulators and law enforcement agencies are likely to be very interested in the case, as evidenced by the recent cases against Coinbase for insider trading. Bitcoin Price Manipulated By A Singe Entity At Binance? Notably, rumors surfaced last week that the entire Bitcoin move from $17,000 to $21,000 was initiated by an entity at Binance. First, an anonymous trader pointed to the move being fueled by a BUSD stablecoin whale, citing the BTC Spot CVDs (Cumulative Volume Delta). On January 15, he shared the following chart and wrote: Whole move from 17k to 21k was made by someone on Binance aggressively buying Bitcoin with BUSD. Other exchanges started to buy around 19.5k with USDT + USD. Green CVD includes all exchanges with Binance USDT as well, yellow CVD – only BUSD. Yesterday, the trader wrote that both CVDs are showing a Bitcoin bearish divergences since yesterday. “Green line – spot CVD with all stablecoins including our loved one BUSD, blue line – perps CVD with all stablecoins as well. Looks like passive seller won this time,” the trader said. However, the trader also clarified that while he was the first to report the huge BTC buying with BUSD on Binance, he never mentioned the words “cartel” or “manipulation.” At press time, the Bitcoin price was once again attacking the $23,000 level.

Polygon-Ethereum Bridge Dominant As of January 23, there were $2.18 billion of assets locked in the Ethereum-Polygon ERC-20 Bridge, almost twice the value of assets locked between the Ethereum and Arbitrum bridge which, at the time of writing, stood at $1.36 billion. Another Plasma bridge, connecting Ethereum and Polygon, is also the third most active, locking over $894 million as of press time. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Consolidates Below $1,650 As The Bulls Aim Another Rally The Arbitrum: L1 Custom Gateway, Arbitrum: L1 ERC20 Gateway, the Optimism: Gateway; and the Polygon (Matic): Ether Bridge connectors locked significant amounts of tokens. Meanwhile, dYdX: L2 Perpetual Smart Contract; Synthetix: L2 Deposit Escrow; and AnySwap: Fantom Bridge were the other links that capped the top 10 most active. Bridges are essential for ETH. Since the blockchain is not inherently interoperable, unlike most competing blockchains designed using the Cosmos Core, bridges are indispensable for a functional ecosystem benefiting end users. Most protocols strive to connect their ecosystems to ETH. As of late January 2023, the pioneer smart contracting platform was the most active layer-1, dominating DeFi and NFT activity. There is also a large community of gaming and the metaverse taking advantage of Ethereum’s first mover advantage and vibrant community. The platform’s native token, ETH, is the second most valuable, commanding a market capitalization of $199,974,616,120. According to trackers, each coin changes hands at $1,633.95 when writing. Bridges Bring Interoperability By linking to Ethereum, the community benefits from the resulting interoperability and connectivity. It is especially so because ETH is, by default, not interoperable. Therefore, while billions of assets are locked in DeFi and NFT platforms, other ecosystems that might be active and trying to link their communities may only succeed with secure bridges. Besides moving value between blockchains, Bridges are also beneficial in transferring vital data. Through data fluidity, developers in Ethereum or other connecting platforms can unlock new features and use cases. Secure bridges can effectively expand the design space for what protocols offer. Besides, it will be possible for users to leverage strengths in other networks that might be absent in Ethereum. Related Reading: If Any Crypto Will Reach $1 Trillion, It’s Ethereum, Not Bitcoin: Dragonfly Capital Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism are all ETH layer-2 protocols. They are purposely designed to take advantage of Ethereum’s mainnet properties but offer relatively low fees and high scalability. Therefore, this means protocols deploying on Arbitrum and Optimism, taking advantage of these platforms’ rollups, or Polygon’s sidechain would technically access ETH dApps. This interoperability would, in essence, also drive mainnet activity since users won’t have to make drastic changes. For example, they can still connect to the compatible layer-2 platform using MetaMask as they go about their DeFi, gaming, or metaverse activities.

The ARB is also seeking to tighten the rules for social media influencers who promote crypto.  “This is a wonderful example of an industry that sees the harm that could be done in its name, and steps up to self-regulate the issues without being forced to do so by government,” Gail Schimmel, chief executive officer of the ARB, said in an emailed statement.  Crypto ads “must expressly and clearly state that investing in crypto assets may result in the loss of capital as the value is variable and can go up as well as down,” said the updated ARB guidance.  Social media influencers and ambassadors should only share factual information rather than offer advice on trading or promising guaranteed returns, it added.  The country is the latest to seek to ensure crypto publicity is fair and honest. The U.K. is also proposing legislation to constrain crypto promotions.

Bitcoin Reserves Dropping On-chain data shows that exchange, digital asset banks, and miner BTC reserves are relatively lower. Over the past weeks, the spot price of BTC has soared over 40%, bottoming at around $15,300 registered in Q4 2022. Bitcoin has now risen to retest $23,300, reaching a new Q1 2023 high. As history shows, the spike in Bitcoin prices should be at the back of solid support, mainly from heavyweights, including miners and digital asset banks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $23,000 As Crypto Market Cap Revisits $1 Trillion Mark Bitcoin miners tend to have big reserves of BTC at any point in time since they need to liquidate from time to time, meeting operation costs. In recent months, following the drop in Bitcoin prices coupled with a high hash rate potentially making mining success harder, their reserves have declined. Looking at Bitcoin Miners’ and Digital Asset Banks’ Reserves According to streams, BTC reserves fell from 1.847 million on January 12 to 1.836 million on January 2023. During this time, the price of Bitcoin has been on a bullish run, questioning whether the pump is on an empty tank. It should be noted that miners tend to offload their coins when unsure of the price trajectory in weeks and months ahead. Their selling deluge punctures the upside momentum and might even push the coin lower. However, when miners are confident about what lies ahead, they accumulate, expecting the shift in trend to result in tidy profits on their end. Therefore, the current divergence between miner reserves and prices could be a bearish signal. Besides miners, digital asset bank reserves are declining. Digital asset bank reserves refer to BTC held by these regulated institutions. Over the past few months, following the collapse of FTX, Alameda Research, and the effects it had on other players, including DCG and Genesis Global, their activity has been near non-existent. The contraction means institutions are playing safe and may not be willing to accumulate and store their coins in these ramps. During the last bull cycle, from 2020 to 2021, there was noticeable activity amongst digital asset banks, pointing to possible interest from institutions. Related Reading: This Bitcoin On-Chain Reading Confirms The Rally Is Getting Started Although traders and optimists might interpret the recent bounce in crypto prices as a net positive for BTC, the absence of leads, judging from institutional activity, may question whether the current rally would last longer. There might be a regulatory angle affecting digital asset banks’ involvement. Government agencies are asking whether crypto venture capitals and service providers did adequate due diligence before exposure to crypto in the last bull cycle. At the same time, some digital asset banks are reducing their crypto exposure, affecting activity.

42388200,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR8bkV,1674460262,Crypto Gaming Token AXS Surges 40% Ahead of $64M Token Unlock,"Play-to-earn giant Axie Infinity's AXS cryptocurrency is rallying despite the impending unlocking of millions of dollars worth of tokens.  AXS has gained over 40% in the past 24 hours, reaching a four-month high of $13.94, according to CoinDesk data.  The dollar value locked in the number of open contracts in perpetual futures tied to AXS has soared by 156% to $104 million in the past 24 hours, per Coinalyze. An increase in open interest alongside a price rally indicates an influx of new money on the bullish side.  Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as ""axies,"" which are digitized as non-fungible tokens (NFT). Axie infinity shards or AXS is a governance token ofthe Axie Infinity game.  The latest positive market action may seem confounding, as some 4.8 million AXS tokens ($64 million at the current price of $13.31) – the equivalent of 1.8% of the cryptocurrency's total supply of 270 million – will be freed up later Monday, according to data source TokenUnlocks.  Unlocks are considered bearish catalysts that free up liquidity and open doors for investors to lock in profits. Tokens are locked up to prevent the big bag holders – usually early investors or even the project's team members – from selling their coins all at once and causing price dumps.  According to Felix Hartmann, managing partner at crypto investment firm Hartmann Capital, the confounding rally results from the hope that the Axie team will announce a positive catalyst to counteract the bearish impact of the token unlock.  ""Over the last 12 months crypto teams have started building a track record for saving big announcements for unlock days. It's happened so consistently that people now expect a bullish catalyst around unlocks,"" Hartmann told CoinDesk.  Substack publication Unlocks Calendar recently made a similar observation.  ""As we experience positive market momentum, teams with upcoming unlocks will release good news that they withheld for months when the market was dead,"" Unlocks Calendar tweeted on Jan. 14. ""The goal would be riding positive market moves to pump the price just before unlocks.""  AXS is one of the several cryptocurrencies gaining ground ahead of the token unlock. Decentralized perpetuals-focused exchange dYdX's cryptocurrency has jumped 64% this month, outperforming market leaders bitcoin and ether, despite a looming unlock on Feb. 2. APT, the native cryptocurrency of layer 1 blockchain Aptos, also rallied 40% in the week leading up to its token unlock that took place on Jan. 12. The cryptocurrency's price has doubled to $13 since then.  ""The market has become so reflexive that people buy in anticipation of unlock news,"" Hartmann said, calling the new trend of releasing good news along with the token unlocks unethical.  ""I view this new trend as fairly unethical as you are creating a buzz to help your investors unload on retail [investors] who are unaware of things like unlocks,"" Hartmann told CoinDesk.  Some observers have long argued that the impact of unlocks accentuate the prevailing market trend. ""Large unlocks of tokens are a complex event that interface with market psychology. Simply put, large unlocks can be bullish catalysts in bulls, and bearish catalysts in bears. They unlock liquidity to continue the prevailing trend,"" Chris Burniske, co-founder of New York-based crypto-focused venture firm Placeholder, tweeted in April 2021, explaining the bullish reactions to token unlocks that took place in early 2021.  Back then, a bull frenzy had gripped the market with bitcoin hitting new record highs almost every other week. The market has seen a bull revival this month, with leading cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether rallying 35% each.  AXS has gained over 100% this month, topping the 200-day simple moving average for the first time since 2020. The bull revival is yet to rekindle interest in the gaming platform.  Data from the gaming statistics website ActivePlayer shows Axie has had 432,001 live players count in the past 30 days, the lowest since October 2020. The gaming platform consistently had more than 2 million players between September 2021 and May 2022.",POSITIVE,AXS,AXS | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/23/crypto-gaming-token-axs-surges-40-ahead-of-64-million-token-unlock,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2dfff586a94bbc3bc7a42a591464e08c6b94c2b-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Several developers reported the error on GitHub but said all nodes were restarted automatically.  Block-producing nodes were temporarily affected, a Telegram broadcast message shows. Nodes are network stakeholders that maintain and process transactions on any blockchain and are very essential to any network’s upkeep.  “There was a brief period of degradation,” Rick McCracken, a developer building staking tools for Cardano, tweeted. “Most nodes impacted had gracefully recovered. No network restart was required.”  Blockchain nodes have previously gone offline on networks such as Solana, with one such instance causing the entire Solana network to be disrupted for over seven hours in May, as CoinDesk reported. In a separate instance in 2021, Solana validators had to restart the network to troubleshoot a network stoppage.  Reasons for node failure can range from an overload of transactional activity to faulty code. However, a quick fix may indicate strong fundamentals for the affected network. The Cardano community is cheering the quick revival, calling it evidence of Cardano being a better blockchain than Solana, which took several hours to restore the network when it faced multiple outages in 2022.  ""The real takeaway for me is how impressively resilient the cardano network is. Something took down ~60% of nodes and the network recovered in a few minutes, and continued producing blocks throughout,"" Pi Lanningham, chief technology officer of Cardano-based decentralized exchange SundaeSwap, tweeted.

Layer 1 blockchain Aptos’ APT token is up 250% in just 14 days even as the broader crypto market grapples with bankruptcies, lawsuits and a decline in overall sentiment.  The token commands a market capitalization of over $2.3 billion on Monday, making Aptos the 30th-most valued network based on current token supply, with a fully diluted valuation of $14 billion based on their total supply.  The price was just shy of $14 on Monday, up from last week’s $7 and over 300% from November’s $3 lows, per CoinDesk data. The move was primarily led by spot tokens because the APT futures market remained relatively muted.  Non-fungible token markets on Aptos appear to have contributed to that growth. Data from Aptos NFT marketplace Topaz show collections such as Aptomingos – a set of comic flamingos – and Aptos Monkeys attracted tens of thousands in trading volume in the past 24 hours, with the minimum prices of several NFT projects rising in the past week.  Some popular traders on Crypto Twitter expect interest in Aptos NFTs to surge in the coming days. Flipping NFTs – a term for quick buying and selling of an asset – built on the network have steadily become trendy among opportunistic traders, several tweets by various community members suggest.  The Aptos mainnet was launched on Oct.18 to reasonable scrutiny and technical difficulties. Some criticized the way APT tokens were distributed: Investors and the Aptos Foundation received almost half the 1 billion tokens issued, leading to concerns that investors and the foundation could potentially liquidate their tokens, which would trigger a negative market reaction.  The team, for its part, defended the token distributions citing adequate lockup periods put in place to prevent any large investor from dumping their holdings en masse. ""Our goal when we designed the tokenomics was to create something that fairly represents the community,"" Aptos CEO Mo Shaikh told CoinDesk in an interview.

Binance said in the statement emailed to CoinDesk that Signature had told the company that it “would no longer support “any of its crypto exchange customers with buying and selling amounts of less than 100,000 USD as of February 1, 2023,” and that this would be true for “all Signature’s crypto exchange clients.”  “As a result, some individual users” might not be able to use SWIFT bank transfers to purchase or sell digital assets “with/for USD” for smaller amounts.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  A Weekend Bitcoin Spurt Past $23K  By James Rubin  Bitcoin continued its recent buoyancy over the weekend, rising over $23,000 at one point – BTC's first time above the threshold since early August – before retreating late Sunday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading above $22,750, roughly flat for the last 24 hours but up more than 8% during the past week. Bitcoin has risen roughly 37% this year as investors dismiss various crypto industry headwinds, most recently Genesis Global Holdco LLC filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, although in an email to CoinDesk Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, said the rise was typical for first quarters and noted ""a long consolidation period that saw shorts accumulating.""  ""The market has risen, partially fueled the short squeeze,"" DiPasquale wrote, adding that ""bitcoin and several altcoins are overheated and due for a correction. ""We wouldn’t be surprised to see bitcoin testing $20,000 in the coming days.""  ""For the week ahead, market participants should be mindful of downside risks and potentially seek to take profits.""  Ether followed a similar weekend path and was recently changing hands near $1,640, up about 1% from Saturday, same time. The second-largest crypto in market value is up approximately 4.5% for the past week and 35% since Dec. 31.  Most other major cryptos assumed a light green hue, although AXS, the token of the Axie Infinity gaming platform, and YGG, the native crypto of play-to-earn gaming guild Yield Guild Games, were up more than 38% and 18%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a measure of leading cryptos' market performance, was up slightly.  Cryptos' weekend rise followed a positive Friday for equity indexes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, jumped 2.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Traditional asset markets have looked optimistically at mounting evidence that inflation is waning without casting the economy into a steep recession, and are hopeful that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be ratcheting back its next interest rate hike to 25 basis points (bps) from its more recent diet of 75 and 50 bps increases.  Meanwhile, Signature Bank will not handle crypto transactions larger than $100,000, according to a Bloomberg report that cited a statement from exchange giant Binance. In a statement to Bloomberg, Binance said that Signature, which has been looking to reduce its exposure to crypto markets, would ""no longer support any crypto exchange customers with buying and well amounts less than 100,000 USD as of February 1, 2023."" Binance said that this would be ""the case for all Signature's crypto exchange clients"" and noted that some users might ""not be able to use SWIFT bank transfers to buy or sell crypto with/for USD"" is smaller amounts.

But given the recent “issues” in the space, Signature will reduce that amount to under 20% and potentially under 15% eventually, Signature's Joe DePaolo said at an investor conference hosted by investment bank Goldman Sachs.  Despite his cautious outlook for the week, BitBull's DiPasquale was more sanguine about the crypto ""market's appetite for risk.""  ""This is a positive sign for an eventual recovery, but we believe that may need more time and could materialize by end of the year,"" he wrote.

While layoffs were to be expected at the computing giant as it follows the rest of its peers, they have impacted a specific segment of the company, which might impact exactly what the future idea of the metaverse looks like.  As Windows Central reports, Microsoft has laid off its entire mixed reality team, which was behind its virtual reality, augmented reality and HoloLens – its enterprise-focused augmented reality headset – efforts. This includes AltSpace VR, Microsoft’s social VR platform which competes with Horizon Worlds.  Microsoft called its augmented and virtual reality efforts ""mixed reality,"" and given the company’s size and scale, it probably had the best shot of making this a new computing paradigm. Microsoft Teams, used widely for collaboration, was fully integrated into the HoloLens as of December.  But the metaverse proved to be a struggle for Microsoft.  While Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) has gone for the retail side of virtual reality and the metaverse, Microsoft has gone for enterprise users. The premiere enterprise client for the HoloLens was supposed to be the U.S. Army, but Congress isn’t so hot on the idea because test results have been mixed, which has led to limited funding. The head of HoloLens at Microsoft left around the middle of the year.  If you’re bullish on the idea that the metaverse includes some sort of headset for virtualized reality, this isn’t very good for that thesis.  The struggle to catch on  VR/AR is far from new, but found new energy when venture capitalists invented the term ""metaverse"" (to be sure, the metaverse doesn’t necessarily need to include VR or AR).  In the gaming world, VR has struggled to evolve past its status as a niche product. Headset sales have been growing since their widespread introduction in 2016, but this growth has slowed. In late December, consultancy IDC published a new forecast for AR/VR headsets that shows slowing growth for the medium.  Enterprise should have been where VR/AR – and thus the metaverse – succeeded. But this doesn’t really seem to have caught on either. Microsoft chose to axe these teams when it needed to reduce spending because executives, privy to nonpublic numbers and discussions with potential customers, apparently didn’t see the value the medium.  The unmentioned issue here is Apple’s presence. Apple has the potential ability to make a market for a product that others have tried to do and struggled. Remember, the iPhone wasn’t the first smartphone. Palm, Microsoft and Nokia had internet-connected PDAs and phones out before Apple entered the arena. But all of these were largely forgettable compared to the iPhone.  Apple still plans to enter the metaverse in 2024-2025 with a mixed-reality headset, according to a report from Bloomberg. Its original plan of building AR glasses has been postponed due to technical challenges, but the company is still committed.  By the time Apple enters the market, perhaps in 2025, VR/AR would have been around for a decade. Any other medium with such limited performance would be labeled a niche and the market would move on, not giving it much attention. The question is, can Apple change this where the likes of Microsoft and HTC have struggled?  The idea of the metaverse with a headset displaying a virtualized form of reality is counting on this.
