42412930,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6wUg,1675898248,Coinbase's CEO Cites 'Rumors' the SEC May Ban Crypto Staking for Retail Customers,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says he's heard rumors the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would like to ban retail investors from engaging in cryptocurrency staking, the income-generating technique at the core of running blockchains including Ethereum.  ""I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen,"" he tweeted Wednesday.  The SEC declined to comment.  While Armstrong's suspicions may come as a surprise to many in the industry, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has previously stated that cryptocurrencies that allow staking could be classified as securities as defined by the Howey test – even though ether has been designated as a commodity by the SEC's sister regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  Read more: SEC Warns That Retirement Accounts’ Crypto Stakes May Be Unregistered Securities  After a congressional hearing in September 2022, Gensler told reporters that, while he wasn't referring to any token in particular, staking was ""another indica that, under the Howey test, the investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts of others.""  A significant amount of money is staked. The value of staked assets was about $42 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, with annualized staking rewards of $3 billion, according to a report from Staked, a noncustodial staking service provider. That figure was not limited to just retail investors.  Alison Mangiero, the executive director of the Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) told CoinDesk that her organization opposes any assertion that staking constitutes an unregistered security.  ""Staking tends to get misconstrued with unrelated activities like lending, but staking is fundamentally a way for anyone to join in providing security for proof-of-stake networks,"" Mangiero said. ""The existence of staking service providers allows everyday Americans to participate in staking, which democratizes network consensus and validation and is core to the continued growth of the global decentralized internet. Any regulatory action that runs counter to this misunderstands the nature of staking, and hinders America's ongoing efforts to foster domestic technological innovation.""

The firm’s research arm published a blog post on Wednesday showing that 13,000 Ordinals were minted or “inscribed” between their debut on Dec. 14 and Feb. 7.  In a few short weeks, the sudden influx of JPEGs and other media files onto Bitcoin has consumed 526 megabytes (MB) of block space and cost creators 6.77 bitcoin (roughly $155,000 at the time of publication), according to the post.  When plotted out graphically, the total number of Ordinals transactions to date shows a steep “hockey stick” curve, indicating NFT activity on Bitcoin has gone exponential.  The surging popularity of Ordinals has drawn the ire of prominent Bitcoiners such as Rene Pickhardt, who accused the Ordinals crowd of “spamming” the most dominant blockchain with oversized JPEGs.  Critics like Pickhardt have some data to back their view.

One thing investors can agree on about Bitcoin: it is very volatile. I've invested in single-inverse ETFs since they have existed. It's nice to have one for this purpose. I initalize my coverage of BITI with a Buy rating. Anything with Bitcoin is a trading call, but I like the reward/risk tradeoff here. By Rob Isbitts On 2/6/23, I took a small position within my ""go anywhere"" personal account to buy some shares of ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), an 8-month-old ETF that dares to bet against Bitcoin (BTC-USD), even for tactical purposes. As with anything I write for Seeking Alpha, my articles (and I suspect those of many other folks) are to discuss what we see. My BITI purchase in small size is simply an acknowledgement that the recent move in the now-iconic cryptocurrency from $17,000 to nearly $24,000 in 4 weeks was more likely a trading frenzy move, and not the start of a secular Bitcoin bull market. Any investor should realize by now that Bitcoin's price acts like it has a mind of its own. And in a market starved for good long-term ideas, angling in to try to grab a piece of a potential retracement of a move of 40% in 4 weeks is, if nothing else, a good reward/risk tradeoff. As they say on Wall Street, trees don't grow to the sky. Especially trees you can't touch, as is the case with Bitcoin. Strategy BITI shorts Bitcoin futures. It is managed by ProShares, a longtime market leader and innovator in providing inverse ETFs. ETF Grades Offense/Defense: Defense Segment: Inverse Sub-Segment: Bitcoin Technical Ratings Short-Term (next 3 months): N/A (limited data) Long-Term (next 12 months): N/A (limited data) Rating scale: A = Excellent, B = Good, C = Fair, D = Weak, F = Poor For a detailed description of MII's proprietary technical rating system, see disclosures at bottom of this report. Holding Analysis BITI is simply a short position in Bitcoin futures. That single position is backed by US Treasury Bills. This aims to provide the opposite return of Bitcoin futures. Strengths ProShares has been a very helpful firm over the years to those of us who like to express our market views and pursue profits by owning ETFs that go up when a part of the market does, and also by owning ETFs that go up when that same part of the market goes down. Importantly, I prefer to do the vast majority of my investing on the short side of the market not by using levered ETFs, but by owning transparent, straightforward, unlevered securities. Just as with many ETFs before it that deliver that -1X exposure to the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Russell 2000 Smallcap, High Yield Bonds and more, BITI leaves an investor just one click away from being able to profit from a decline in Bitcoin. Importantly, there are multiple ETFs that also allow an investor to take the other side of that trade, rather than owning Bitcoin directly. Weaknesses Anyone buying an ETF linked in any way to Bitcoin should understand what they are getting themselves into: a probable wild ride which on any given day can see your investment change in value by 5-10% without breaking a sweat (even if the investor does). Bitcoin is as much a revolution and a mission for many investors as it is an ""investment."" That means that at any moment, the crowd can again whip itself up into a frenzy, and take down a chunk of your investment. It is reminiscent of an old Henry Winkler movie, ""Night Shift,"" in which his character bears no resemblance to his classic Fonzi character from ""Happy Days."" Winkler's character works the night shift, and is shown throughout the movie going up the subway himself to return home, with a throng of New York City workers rushing past him on their way to start their work day. Shorting Bitcoin might feel like that sometimes. In addition, BITI is not a very big ETF, at $100mm in AUM. That size should not be a big issue, given the single holding other than the T-Bill collateral for those short Bitcoin futures. But it is worth mentioning here. Opportunities I look at every investing decision the same way: 1. Is the reward potential greater than the potential for major loss? 2. Does this ETF fit in alongside the rest of my portfolio holdings? On question 1, my answer is yes, given the latest sharp upward move in Bitcoin, and my broader view that risk assets at best need a break, and at worst are poised to break down, following a vibrant start to 2023. However, in the case of BITI and some other notoriously volatile ETFs I have opined on for Seeking Alpha, position size is absolutely everything. As an example, if I were to normally take, say, a 10% position in a single inverse ETF, I would be inclined to take a small fraction of that with something as volatile as BITI. If the tactical position works out, there's a nice profit to be made. But if the decision ultimately fails, the loss is limited, since the position size was. I fear that this is a part of investing that many do not sufficiently account for when managing their own assets. There is a lot of emphasis on ""what should I buy now"" and much less on ""what should I surround it with."" I am hoping to continue to provide some insight on portfolio construction to this audience as time goes on. And that essentially answers question 2 from above. BITI can be viewed in isolation, but it is truly a powerful tactical opportunity when it is used to allocate a relatively small portion of a portfolio to something ((BITI)) that could rally 50% if it simply returns to where it was during the first week of 2023. Threats Have you heard of Bitcoin?! But seriously, the threat of Bitcoin when contemplating a time frame of months or even weeks, not years, is two-fold: owning it is a threat. And so it shorting it. If you play in this sandbox, you are likely to get some sand in your face along the way. Again, my modest venture into BITI is more about an attempt to find tactical value in an indecisive market for stocks and bonds, rather than as a major statement about where Bitcoin, crypto and the blockchain are going over the next decade. BITI is simply an ETF that allows investors to try to make money whenever Bitcoin falls in value. Conclusions ETF Quality Opinion I wrote a piece for another publication a while back entitled ""How Bitcoin could go to $10,000, not $100,000."" Bitcoin stood at around $34,000 when that article published on January 24, 2022. It has since dropped as low as about $16,000, and the recent price surge in early 2023 has been one of Bitcoin's most impressive moves in some time. But as the guy who penned that article, allowing for the potential for Bitcoin to ultimately fall to new multi-year lows, albeit with plenty of wild price changes along the way, BITI is an ETF I'm glad to have access to. ETF Investment Opinion I am a big believer in the future of blockchain technology. But as cryptocurrencies go, they still operate like trading and sentiment-monitoring vehicles to me. So at a moment like this, and with my usual willingness to ""take big risks with small amounts of money"" (that's me quoting me), I place a Buy on BITI here. Modern Income Investor's proprietary technical rating system was created by the firm's founder, Rob Isbitts, a chartist for more than 40 years. The ratings emphasize risk management, and the belief that while any investment can appreciate in price at any time, each investment carries a different level of potential for major loss. The balance of reward and risk is calculated each night for thousands of securities, using a formula that analyzes price trend, strength of that trend and key price levels. It analyzes data over multiple time frames to produce a short-term rating (looking 3 months out) and a long-term rating (looking 12 months out).",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4576530-biti-short-bitcoin-without-leverage-buy-rating-in-small-size?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9087824.jpeg
42393842,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQxY3,1675895552,Crypto Markets Analysis: Ether Pulls Even With Bitcoin in Year-to-Date Performance,"Ether has matched bitcoin in year-to-date performance because ETH’s’ supply continues to decline.  The two largest cryptocurrencies by market value have each gained about 38% this year, spearheading a wider cryptocurrency market upsweep. A week ago, BTC was outpacing ETH by about 6 percentage points. The shift reflects a 1.4% rise in ETH’s price and concurrent 3.1% drop in BTC.  The change also comes as the ether supply has tumbled by 17,800 year to date. Many investors view ETH as a deflationary asset that will weather upward price pressure better than other digital assets and traditional currencies.  The correlation between the two assets has continued to decline as well. While the correlation coefficient between BTC and ETH is usually above .90, it now sits at .41.  Correlation coefficients range between 1 and -1, with the former implying a strong pricing relationship, and the latter indicating an inverse one.  The falling correlation may stem from the following intertwining factors.  Investors may have seen BTC’s outperformance and ETH’s underperformance as overdone.  As they saw this disconnect, some investors likely identified the opportunity to go long ETH, while BTC investors either stood pat or sold off.  The confluence of those two factors caused the deterioration of the BTC and ETH correlation to accelerate.  Investors should now watch whether the decreased correlation declines further or reverts to historic norms, although with the spread recently evaporating, the latter is likelier to occur.  And investors may also want to watch the net position change for ETH. An increased amount of ether leaving centralized exchanges would signal that holders of the asset are less inclined to sell at the moment.

42412913,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6whm,1675893787,Cross-Chain Protocol Stargate Finance’s Token Surges by Double Digits on Trader Joe Partnership,"​Cross-chain bridge protocol Stargate Finance’s native STG token surged 13% over the past 24 hours following its announced plan to team up with Avalanche-based decentralized exchange Trader Joe to unlock omnichain fungible tokens.  STG has recently climbed from roughly 60 cents a day ago to 92 cents. According to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, it has risen about 50% in the past seven days and 150% this year, outperforming most altcoins in the current broader digital asset rally.  The partnership with Trader Joe means that Stargate will support the increasingly popular JOE token, without requiring Trader Joe to maintain a liquidity pool on the platform. On Monday, Trader Joe announced its integration with LayerZero, making JOE a multichain token to be natively sent between blockchains.  STG’s climb also follows the Stargate DAO’s passage of a proposal to reissue the token and airdrop it to all STG holders. The decentralized autonomous organization's community had been raising concerns about protocol-owned liquidity (POL) and STG holder security stemming from its entanglement with Alameda Research, the trading arm of disgraced crypto exchange FTX.  The Stargate DAO stated in the proposal that Alameda purchased 10% of the total STG supply from the Stargate Community sale on March 17, 2022, and then committed to lock up all these tokens until March 2025. But following FTX’s meltdown, recent on-chain transfers from known Alameda wallets revealed that ""Alameda does not have full control of its wallets and that a malicious actor or hacker is misappropriating Alameda’s funds,” the Stargate DAO said.  “Without a token re-issuance, a malicious actor with access to Alameda’s private keys could claim the Stargate tokens from the contract as they vest and misappropriate them as they seem to have with other funds,” the proposal read. Stargate will reissue STG tokens on March 15.  In addition, a short squeeze over the past 48 hours has pushed STG’s price higher. Data sourced from crypto futures data platform Coinglass showed that traders liquidated some $342,000 of STG short positions versus around $126,000 of STG long positions.  Elsewhere in markets  Layer 1 blockchain NEAR Protocol’s NEAR token also rose by double-digits over the past 24 hours. NEAR was recently changing hands at $2.72, a 9% gain since Tuesday, same time. The price pump followed the protocol’s announcement that it was collaborating with New York University to start a Web 3 learning workshop. SAND, the token of metaverse game The Sandbox, was down 2%, its recent momentum fading from its announcement the Saudi Arabia Digital Government Authority would be partnering with the platform.  Meanwhile, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, bitcoin and ether, were recently down roughly a percentage point to hold their most recent support.

Emergent Fidelity Technologies is the holding company controlled by former FTX executives Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice seized those shares of Robinhood stock, worth nearly $500 million at the time.  ""The proposed share purchase underscores the confidence the Board of Directors and management team have in our business,"" the company wrote in its press release.  On the earnings call with analysts, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said “we think this repurchase will be accretive over time and remove a distraction for shareholders.” He noted that the company's balance sheet is strong with over $6 billion in cash.  Tenev added that because it was an unusual situation, he couldn’t predict how long the purchase of its shares will take, but that it would keep investors updated on its progress.  It wasn’t immediately clear who Robinhood would be buying the shares from.  The ownership of the stock is in dispute as the fraud case against Bankman-Fried continues to unfold.  Emergent Fidelity, which was co-founded by FTX founders Bankman-Fried and Wang, bought the shares but promised them as collateral for a loan from crypto lender BlockFi. The lender, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year, has filed to lay claim to the value of the shares.  FTX has likewise claimed the shares as part of its own bankruptcy process, as has Bankman-Fried in his own ongoing legal issues.  While Emergent Fidelity did not file for bankruptcy alongside the other FTX entities in November, the holding company did file for bankruptcy protection this year.

The tokens – Vaiot's VAI, SingularityNET's AGIX, Fetch.ai's FET, DeepBrain Chain's (DBC) and GNY – are all up at least 70% in value in the past week, outperforming the CoinDesk Market Index – which barely budged, decreasing 0.68% over the same period. The leader of that pack, AGIX, had the largest jump at over 160%. CoinDesk reviewed the trends through data platform SigDev.  AI tokens are garnering massive interest from the crypto space, and their growth in both price and search traffic is one signal showing traders trying to capitalize on the flurry of AI-related headlines that have captured the zeitgeist because of ChatGPT.

42412910,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6wfu,1675887195,MakerDAO Contributors Propose First Native Liquidity Market Focused on DAI Stablecoin,"Leading MakerDAO community participants have proposed creating a liquidity market called Spark Protocol for lending and borrowing crypto assets focused on DAI, Maker’s $5 billion stablecoin, according to a proposal posted on Wednesday in Maker’s governance forum.  The first product will be Spark Lend, which will allow users to borrow DAI at a set DAI Savings Rate, which currently stands at 1%. According to the proposal, Spark Lend will support highly liquid decentralized assets as collateral such as ETH, DAI and wrapped derivatives of staked ETH (wstETH) and BTC (wBTC). Future features will include fixed-term yield products and the inclusion of Maker’s own synthetic liquid staking derivative (LSD) called EtherDAI.  Spark aims to launch in April by opening a DAI lending vault on Maker with a $200 million debt ceiling, according to the proposal.  Spark would use the smart contract system of Aave v3, the recently upgraded third version of the DeFi lending giant. In exchange, the developer team Phoenix Labs intends to send 10% of the protocol’s profits earned on the Spark Protocol’s DAI market in the next two years to Aave DAO.  Implementing the Spark Protocol is subject to a vote by the Maker community.  A milestone for Maker  MakerDAO is one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and also issues the $5 billion DAI stablecoin backed by some $7 billion of assets in its treasury. Aave is a top lending protocol, with $7.2 billion of total value locked on the platform. Both protocols are managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) through voting, where those that hold governance tokens can favor and oppose proposals.  The proposal marks a milestone for Maker as Spark is set to be the first native Maker-based lending interface that any crypto user can interact with, including by connecting their crypto wallets and borrowing directly from Maker, according to a statement sent by email.  Spark aims to bring extra revenue to Maker by its users’ lending and borrowing activity. Maker has been seeking to boost revenue streams by allocating a part of its $7 billion in reserve assets to various yield-generating strategies such as partnering with crypto exchange Coinbase’s (COIN) custody platform and investing in U.S. government bonds. Maker distributes a part of the extra revenue among DAI holders by offering a 1% annual reward, which is called the DAI Savings Rate.  The proposal builds on Maker founder Rune Christensen’s ambitious-yet-controversial “Endgame plan,” which is essentially poised to break up MakerDAO’s management structure into smaller blocks called SubDAOs.  Read more: MakerDAO Members Support Founder's 'Endgame' Plan to Break Up into MetaDAOs, $2.1B of Transfers  The team behind the Spark Protocol proposal is Phoenix Labs, a recently created company that includes leading figures in the MakerDAO developer community and focuses on building new products on top of the Maker protocol.  “As part of the Endgame plan, multiple competitive SubDAOs are being formed next year with associated tokens that are linked to cash flows from the SubDAO products,” Sam MacPherson, the chief technology officer of Phoenix Lab and a renowned Maker contributor, tweeted.  The Spark protocol will be fully owned by the Maker community. “Once the Creator subDAO model is established, Spark Protocol can be transitioned to one of them,” according to the proposal.",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MKR | DAI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/08/makerdao-contributors-propose-first-native-liquidity-market-focused-on-dai-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a0e006cb42f0c01af1c1ee4d2de218264708e8f-4011x2687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412900,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6wXU,1675885701,Kraken’s Head Of Strategy: Our Business Felt Crypto Winter's Chill,"Even Kraken, one of the largest centralized crypto exchanges by trading volume, hasn’t been immune to the global economy’s shifting trends, said Thomas Perfumo, its head of strategy.  “We’re not insulated from the broader macro and economic environment,” Perfumo told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday, adding that crypto winter “definitely had an effect on the business.”  Earlier this month, Kraken closed its Abu Dhabi office, less than a year after it had obtained a local license to operate in the emirate. In December the exchange said it was leaving Japan by the end of January.  Perfumo said Kraken’s Abu Dhabi and Japan offices were small parts of the business. Now the company is looking to “hunker down and focus on the big core parts.” Instead of opening a large number of regional offices, Kraken is limiting the “depth of our services,” he said.  “So in some cases we might not offer access or funding with the local currency,” he said. “However, you might be in a particular region where if you have access to bitcoin you can still deposit that bitcoin to Kraken and use some of our other services where it applies.”  The San Francisco-based exchange, founded in 2011, serves millions of users in over 200 countries, according to CoinMarketCap.  Kraken is looking to expand in Europe and North America, according to Perfumo, who added the firm is looking to provide “as much possible global access” to the exchange’s services where they’re applicable. Currently, the exchange is open to U.S. residents except those in New York and Washington State.  Kraken, and other industry players, continue to navigate crypto’s slump. In November the exchange cut back 30% of its staff, or roughly 1,100 employees, because of the crypto industry’s market downturn.  Perfumo said Kraken is now looking to “focus and narrow its scope to parts of the business that are likely to drive the greatest amount of impact.”  It also wants to help rebuild “trust and reputation within the industry.” Kraken “specifically has had no material exposure to all of the volatility in the industry when it came to centralized firms collapsing throughout 2022.”  “We’re focused on that long-term vision to increase and to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency, and we’re focused on delivering a great client experience in the meantime,” Perfumo said. He added Kraken is “constantly focused on earning our clients trust every single day, day in day out, through things like proof of reserves, even before it mattered.”  Read more: Crypto Exchange Kraken to End Japan Operations",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/08/krakens-head-of-strategy-our-business-felt-crypto-winters-chill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48a705adc932bc485920efcd8095e3874c128e02-3600x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The collection of player cards will include 22 National Football League players from the two teams that will be in the year’s largest football event on Sunday. From Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes to Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, gamers can take their famed player cards into the esports game when it officially launches on mobile later this year.  Billy Schautz, executive producer of NFL Rivals, told CoinDesk that Web3 technologies provide a unique experience for football fans to interact with their favorite players in the game.  “Ahead of the biggest day in sports, the Rivals team is excited to give fans the opportunity to get their hands on Super Bowl LVII Rivals player cards, to build their team rosters with and use as their players in the game,” said Schautz.  However, crypto and the Super Bowl aren’t necessarily on the best terms right now. While last year’s event could've been called the “Crypto Bowl” because of the many cryptocurrency advertisements that aired, Fox Sports said Tuesday the network would not be broadcasting any crypto commercials this year. It isn't cheap to buy Super Bowl ad time and the crypto sector was hit hard by layoffs, bankruptcies and wintry market conditions, especially after the collapse of the FTX exchange – a prominent crypto advertiser last year.  Nonetheless, Mythical aims to garner hype around its upcoming game with new player cards. The presale opens to holders of the unique Rarity League collection on Thursday, followed by a public sale Friday. The 1,000-unit collection of NFTs for the Super Bowl players are sold in a pack of three and retail for $49.

42411231,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKQB,1675883122,Crypto AI Needs a Showcase to Know What's Real,"JPMorgan seems to have confirmed what everyone already knows: The emergent world of artificial intelligence (AI) is the top trend of 2023. In a recently released survey of 835 institutional traders, some 53% cited AI and machine learning when discussing the technologies most likely to reshape finance over the next three years. The tech behind Web3 – namely blockchain and distributed ledgers – ranked third, down a peg from last year when JPMorgan had AI and crypto tied for second in its annual ""The e-Trading Edit"" report.  There are several ways that AI is already influencing the markets. As Barron’s reported, AI-related stocks have ripped in a way reminiscent of crypto’s legendary bull runs. But that doesn’t mean crypto isn’t also having its fun. CryptoSlate composed an index of 73 AI-linked cryptos representing some $4.63 billion in value. The total index is up 87% in the past seven days alone, with some specific tokens seeing triple digital returns.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Much of this recent action was kick-started by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a chat platform some are convinced could pass the Turing Test, designed to measure whether a machine can be taken for as a human. The tool is impressive – it can write smart contracts, compose poetry and is threatening Google’s monopoly on search. Last month Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI to bring its technologies into its industry-defining software suite.  But look no further than Google’s response to OpenAI to see some of the challenges AI has yet to surmise. Today, in a livestream from Paris, Google showcased its own AI chatbot called Bard (based on its proprietary software LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications), which among many things also “hallucinated” that James Webb Space Telescope took the first photo of an exoplanet (an honor earned by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in 2004). Investors were seemingly less than impressed.  Bard is expected to be rolled out across Google’s technology suite within weeks, possibly in much-used apps including Google Maps and search. The threat of AI has reportedly scrambled Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin back into action after stepping back from daily activities years ago. And while there are technical hiccups to overcome, it seems possible artificial intelligence could lead to a new age of innovation.  See also: Is Artificial Intelligence the New Frontier for VC Investments?  The opportunity is apparent in crypto, too. The Alethea image generator is using a token to offset costs of NFTs and offer user incentives.

Platforms like these could one day create cheaper or less privacy-intrusive AI platforms and help share in the wealth created by the next big technological shift – rather than Microsoft and Google reaping all the rewards.  But the soaring prices of AI crypto tokens is a worrying indicator, a reminder that crypto’s primary use case today is speculation. “There is a risk that this whole ‘new trend’ is going to end up in an empty hype, as there are many speculators that would seek to make use of short-term price pumps,” financial market consultant Valentina Drofa told CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa.

Eddy Alexandre, 51, of Valley Stream, N.Y., was arrested in May 2022 and charged with wire fraud and commodities fraud, to which he initially pleaded not guilty. Court records show that Alexandre will change his plea in a new hearing set for Friday afternoon. Inner City Press first reported the news.  According to prosecutors, Alexandre – who, before starting EminiFX, was a long-time cybersecurity engineer – lured investors into his scheme by promising to double their money within five months, promising 5% weekly returns he allegedly generated through a secretive robo-advising technology.  However, Alexandre allegedly invested only a small portion of user funds and spent the rest on either himself – putting millions of dollars in his personal bank account and splashing out on a new BMW – or on business-related expenses, including renting an office and hiring lawyers, prosecutors said.  Authorities say he kept the charade going by providing investors with fake account statements showing their investments were growing between 5% and 10% each week.

42414503,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB8FJz,1675881343,Bitcoin’s Newfound NFT Hype Attracts Interest of BSV Developer Twetch,"The recent fervor surrounding Ordinals NFTs on Bitcoin is already attracting developers interested in building an ecosystem for the meme-themed art – now including Twetch, the team behind a “pay-to-earn” social network built on the rival Bitcoin SV blockchain (BSV).  Twetch’s existing social network on BSV allows users to earn money for their content. The platform also includes a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, a BSV wallet and several other features like a chat function and a job board.  “When we saw the Ordinals stuff come out, we were just excited to hop onto the ‘NFTs on BTC’ train,” Twetch co-founder Billy Rose told CoinDesk in an interview. “We've been doing data on the blockchain for about five years now, so we're just ready to go.”  Bitcoin blocks have been chock-full of quirky JPEGs, audio files and text over the past two weeks, thanks to last month’s successful (albeit controversial) launch of the Ordinals protocol, which stores NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain.  The trend has received mixed reviews from longtime Bitcoin supporters, many of whom have long derided the NFT craze on Ethereum and other blockchains as a distraction from Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of a decentralized network primarily for financial transactions.  Twetch’s sudden interest might provide another cause for consternation among Bitcoiners, given BSV’s self-marketing as the original Bitcoin and its association with Craig Wright – the Australian computer scientist who has claimed without definitive proof to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin.  Even Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor has reservations about Twetch’s association with BSV because of the links to Wright and his questionable evidence. But he welcomed the interest.  “I hope they see the light and start building on Bitcoin,” Rodarmor told CoinDesk. “And if they make a great wallet, that's all for the best.”  Read more: Bitcoin Community Erupts in Existential Debate Over NFT Project Ordinals  Ordinals: Hype or hope?  The Ethereum community has already laid out a successful “blueprint” for a vibrant NFT ecosystem: a browser-based wallet like MetaMask, a marquee brand like Bored Apes and an NFT marketplace like OpenSea.  Twetch’s founders aim to replicate Ethereum’s success by borrowing that blueprint to build a similar NFT model on Bitcoin, especially now that Ordinals has become the dominant blockchain’s shiny new object.  “Ethereum laid the road map out for us – OpenSea, Bored Ape and MetaMask,” Rose explained. “Those are the ultimate tools for using NFTs, working with NFTs, storing them, having true ownership of them and the ability to transfer and trade.”  It’s not clear if the Ordinals craze is just another flash in the pan or a more enduring development.  Twetch’s co-founders are banking on the latter. In fact, Twetch is already exploring raising capital to build its NFT ecosystem on Bitcoin.  “We're just looking for people who want to help … whether that's an investor or customer partnership,” Twetch CEO and co-founder Josh Petty told CoinDesk in an interview. “If anybody can align with having fun on Bitcoin, then we would love to talk to them.”  The case of Satoshi Dice  This wouldn’t be the first time a startup has capitalized on a fun viral trend in the Bitcoin community. Over a decade ago, in April 2012, Erik Voorhees (who later founded cryptocurrency exchange, ShapeShift) launched a clever little gambling game called Satoshi Dice.  Players would send bitcoin to a Satoshi Dice address based on the odds and payout they were seeking (lower odds yielded a higher payout and vice versa). If a player won, a bitcoin payment was immediately sent back to their wallet address.  The game quickly became a smash hit in the Bitcoin community, and by early May 2012 Satoshi Dice was generating more bitcoin transactions than all other use cases combined.  “Amazingly, in the period starting from Bitcoin’s genesis up through early 2014, more than half of all Bitcoin transactions were going to or from Satoshi Dice,” Voorhees told CoinDesk. “This also means the game was paying more than half of all mining fees on the network during those years. It was certainly a killer app.”  In an environment where Bitcoin’s subsidy – the amount of bitcoin awarded to a miner for successfully mining a new transaction block – is progressively shrinking, high transaction fees will become increasingly attractive to miners.  If Ordinals and Twetch were to generate anything similar to the success Satoshi Dice enjoyed between 2012 and 2014, mining fees could increase – and network security would theoretically improve. Hard-line Bitcoiners might have to hold their noses.  “I'm best friends with the Riot Blockchain guys and they're doing really well because they're so big, but anybody lesser is having a hard time right now,” said Petty. (Riot Blockchain is one of the largest public Bitcoin mining companies in the world.) So when they see the fees go up, what I predict is there'll be more miners that start to become pro-Ordinals, because they're [currently] not making a lot of money.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | BSV,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | BSV,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/08/bitcoins-newfound-nft-hype-attracts-interest-of-bsv-developer-twetch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/411f303a98fa29d11f728e3b98ee346f3560c804-1823x677.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411235,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKdP,1675880118,"Bitcoin, Markets and the Symmetry of Information","You’ve probably heard the story of the market for “lemons” – not the fruit, I’m talking about low-quality consumer durables. In his seminal paper, economist George Akerlof showed that information asymmetry as to which second-hand cars are good and which are “lemons” (with sellers knowing more than the buyers) ended up lowering the price and driving out the good cars, because owners of these would not sell at an unfairly low price. This, in theory, should push the price down even further and eventually kill the market.  The thesis has received a lot of pushback over the years, especially from people who correctly point out that the market for second-hand cars is far from dead, but it does raise an important thought experiment: What does the person I’m buying from know that I don’t know?  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Akerlof’s co-Nobel Prize winner Michael Spence extended this to the job market, introducing the theory of signaling and the over-reliance on credentials. Many have looked at how this impacts the stock and bond markets, and information asymmetry is one of the main preoccupations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Asset issuers almost always know more than their target market and, when trading, sellers have different motivations (and presumably different sets of information) than buyers.  Not so with bitcoin and similar crypto assets.  With bitcoin, there is no management meeting behind closed doors to make decisions that will affect future revenue. With bitcoin, nothing gets altered without everyone knowing about it right away, and no code changes get through unless there is widespread consensus.  In this sense, bitcoin is a commodity. Wheat is wheat, gold is gold: We all know what they are and accept that their properties will not change anytime soon. With bitcoin, as with wheat and gold, you know exactly what you are getting.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Shifting Crypto's Center of Gravity  This matters for regulation. The SEC is right in thinking that some crypto assets should be treated like securities (such as tokens linked to projects heavily dependent on a small leadership team that hopes to extract profit from its efforts). But bitcoin has no leadership team – some may argue that the core developers are leaders, but they serve the community and do not maintain the network. What’s more, rules around financial disclosures are designed to level investors’ access to relevant information. It’s hard to imagine a more open book than decentralized blockchain networks.  Information symmetry also matters a lot for market structure. Take lending, for example. In traditional finance, borrowers have a more detailed idea of what they plan to do with the solicited funds, and this may be different than what they tell the lender, who compensates for this lack of transparency by requiring a ton of paperwork and/or applying math to credit profiles. Even when collateral is required, there is uncertainty: is that house, yacht or painting really worth its stated valuation? The compensation for this risk shows up in the interest rate to be applied.  With crypto lending, beyond counterparty risk (painfully relevant these days), there is no information asymmetry. Open-source code can be confirmed, rightful ownership of digital bearer assets is relatively simple to ascertain and their market value is easy to determine 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year.  Crypto collateral can be more volatile than the more traditional kind (although these days not necessarily). But this can be compensated for by high loan-to-value ratios. And the relative ease with which this collateral can be transferred, even programmatically via smart contract escrow should certain conditions be triggered, removes another layer of uncertainty as well as hassle.  This is a huge point. Lending based on high-quality crypto collateral has the potential to be safer, more efficient and more open than that based on traditional assets, largely because of information symmetry. What went wrong last year was lapses in risk and collateral management, often due to a lack of experience and/or oversight. We can hope that lessons have been learned and standards raised. Regulation can play a part as well, by requiring crypto lenders to publish loan-to-value and collateral handling policies.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Code vs. Values: The Crypto Twist on ‘Trust’  Stepping back, we can start to glimpse how market infrastructure could evolve were it able to focus more on liquidity and service, and less on compliance requirements designed to compensate for unequal information access. As well as enabling regulators to dedicate more freed-up resources to go after intentional crime, assets with embedded full disclosure could end up lowering transaction costs and enhancing capital efficiency for savers and builders.  I am by no means suggesting that networks such as Bitcoin are the solution to all the information asymmetry problems out there. I do believe, however, that the transparency, decentralization and open-source nature of some distributed systems can change how certain market-based activities are carried out, by removing layers and adding new types of simplicity.  These new systems could also end up influencing economic theory by showing that not all markets need to involve intangible expectations, and that the pricing in of these expectations does not always need to rely on thick veils of trust. At a time when the “market economy” is increasingly becoming the “information economy,” transparency and verifiability are taking on ever more important roles in defining the habits of transaction.  Obviously, these are sweeping statements, and the crypto market does have its share of lemons. Some projects are run by small teams who can change token characteristics, some blockchains are not decentralized, some assets are not reliably backed and some tokens are based on untested incentives. But established networks such as Bitcoin do offer an alternative way of thinking about the “credible disclosure” problem, with limited technology and human risk.  So, to give Bitcoin its place in the market slang fruit basket, I thought about the opposite of a lemon. Many economists use “peach,” but they bruise easily, wrinkle quickly and I don’t much like them. I’m going to go with “grapes.” They are sweet while lemons are sour, open to the air while lemons are wrapped in protection, and firmly anchored to the vine while lemons are pretty easy to pluck.  I don’t really see this catching on since the concept of “lemons” never made it over into the digital age anyway. In an age that generates and collects more information than we know what to do with, ironically markets today are hindered by information asymmetry as much as ever as much as ever. For the first time, we now have a technology that reliably embeds simple asset information in the asset itself. The subset of assets for which this simplicity is sufficient is small for now – but its impact is already being felt in market services being built today. And its evolution could end up shaping the structure and expectations of the market services of tomorrow.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/08/bitcoin-fixes-the-asymmetry-of-information-problem-in-markets-coindesk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/799384d3e5862b3c2b97f85a560ef7ffd68c2b82-5205x3470.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411243,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glML0Y,1675878211,Bitcoin's 'Golden Cross' Explained,"This week, Glenn Williams Jr. addresses one of the hotter debates in cryptocurrencies at the moment: How traders should feel about bitcoin and ether possibly achieving a “golden cross,” a popular indicator from technical analysis.  Then, Todd Groth, head of index research at CoinDesk Indices, addresses how hugely bullish a wide range of assets have gotten, and where the Federal Reserve fits into this.  – Nick Baker  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The ‘Golden Cross’ Sounds Important for Crypto Traders, But Is It?  Many in the crypto investing realm are excitedly worked up as bitcoin (BTC) nears the vaunted “golden cross.” For those unfamiliar with this price-charting technique, a golden cross happens when a shorter-term moving average (often the 50-day) crosses above a longer-term one (frequently the 200-day).  It’s a fairly common indicator used often by technical analysts, viewed as an indication of a newly forming bull market. As a technician myself, moving average crossovers are certainly something that I pay attention to. Why is it thought-provoking? It puts the current moment into a bigger-picture perspective, prompting you to ask, “What has changed in the short-term to accelerate price movement and is that something I expect to carry on?”  But how good is it as a forecasting tool? It’s one thing to identify a moving-average crossover and state, “This is bullish.” It's something entirely different to see if it actually has been.  As I examine the history of bitcoin, what stands out to me most is just how few times a golden cross has occurred. Since Jan. 1, 2015, there are just six instances when the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossed above the 200-day EMA. (Exponential moving averages give higher weight to more recent prices, whereas simple moving averages equally weight all data points. The use of one versus the other is a matter of personal preference.) It’s even more rare for Ethereum’s ETH, which has experienced just three golden crosses since 2017.  But both are close to doing it again, with BTC 2.4% away from one and ETH 2.1%. The point in looking at them now is to determine whether the assets are approaching something worth paying attention to, or whether it's simply something to talk about. The results are interesting.  Following prior 50-day/200-day golden crosses, BTC went on to gain 4.4% in the ensuing seven days and surged 9.6% in 30 days. You can’t look at those returns in isolation, though. What does BTC do on average across all seven- and 30-day periods? Worse than just after golden crosses, adding 1.6% and 7.5%, respectively, it turns out. There is, in fact, an edge historically when those moving averages cross.  The best 30-day return happened when BTC soared 67% in April and May 2019 following a golden cross. The worst period was the 18.2% loss in May and June 2018.  For ETH (the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, trailing only BTC), golden crosses have not been a bullish indicator. Average seven- and 30-day results were losses of 2% and 8%, respectively. A buy-and-hold strategy has made a lot more sense for ETH than simply getting long the asset based on a moving-average crossover. That statement is informed strongly by ETH’s average performance across all seven- and 30-day spans: gains of 1.5% and 7.3%, respectively.  Surprisingly to me, golden crosses have also been quite rare in more traditional asset classes. For instance, I looked at three big U.S. stock market indexes: the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite. The S&P 500 has seen three golden crosses since the beginning of 2015, while the other two benchmarks had five. Each posted positive 30-day returns in the aftermath. The Nasdaq led the way at 1.5% while the S&P 500 returned 1.15% and the Dow was up 1.13%. I’d argue that none of those returns are worth getting overly excited about.  Taking a step back, though, it is striking that for four of the five assets reviewed (all but ETH), gains were positive 30 days following a golden cross. Over time I think it makes sense to apply the same process to a wider range of cryptocurrencies to identify patterns, if they do indeed exist.  In candor, I wrestle with the significance of the golden cross for crypto given debates around causation versus correlation. I’m also of the opinion that the traditional 50-day/200-day moving average timeframe may have more applicability in traditional finance than in this new frontier of digital assets. Time and testing will be the judge of that. And, finally, I have to question whether the rarity of crosses means that it deserves additional attention – or none at all. I think the truth is somewhere in the middle, with the overarching message being that no single indicator should be viewed in a vacuum.  – Glenn C. Williams Jr., CMT  What's the Deal With This Rally?  Following the bloodbath of 2022, those not paralyzed by shell shock appear to be extremely bullish and loving it. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), our broad benchmark of the cryptocurrency market, is up 40% in 2023. Bitcoin (BTC) up 37%. Even Solana’s SOL has surged almost 150%, rebounding after falling hard in the aftermath of supporter Sam Bankman-Fried’s downfall.  It’s not just crypto. Tesla (TSLA) shares are up almost 100% from their lows of a month ago. Meme-stock favorite Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) soared so much even as the company faces a potential bankruptcy that the company announced it would sell equity to raise needed money. Ryan Cohen, a meme-stock investor, is making moves again with Nordstrom (JWM) and Alibaba (BABA). Cathie Wood boldly states her ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is “the new Nasdaq” after rising 40% in January (while underperforming the Nasdaq-100 by almost 80% on a five-year time horizon). What’s going on here?!?  It feels like markets have regressed to an optimistic, 2021-style mindset due to the U.S. Federal Reserve slowing the pace of interest-rate hikes. The front end of the U.S. yield curve shows this. Just look at the yield difference between six- and 12-month Treasury bills; they are pricing in a Fed rate cut in the third or fourth quarters of this year. (The longer-term yields are now higher than shorter-term ones, leading me to make that observation.)  After last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which resulted in only a 25 basis point rate increase, traders interpreted Chairman Jerome Powell’s relatively balanced comments as an indication the central bank will soon slow its efforts to tame inflation via hikes – fueling the continued buying spree in markets for anything and everything not bolted down.  So-called “bond king” and Doubleline Capital Chief Investment Officer Jeffrey Gundlach has noted that the Fed has historically set its policy rate based on following the two-year Treasury yield on a lagged basis. With the two-year yield crossing the effective federal funds rate, we see that this leading indicator of future rate expectations is calling for cuts. But the real question is the immediacy and timing of any reductions. So, how soon is now?  Digging into the last two rate-hiking cycles (see below), we can see that the two-year yield was under the fed funds rate for a year during the 2016-2019 cycle and two years during the 2004-2008 cycle. These two periods suggest higher rates for longer than the six months priced into the market.  Inflation expectations (as derived from Treasurys including inflation-linked TIPS) are coming down from their 2021-2022 peak, but are still above the average levels seen following the 2008 financial crisis. This is great news, but it should be taken with a grain of salt as the Fed itself holds a sizable portion of the TIPS market (estimated at 25% in 2022, according to Jim Bianco), which may distort the signal sent by this indicator. Add in the unexpectedly strong jobs report last Friday, mixed in with lingering concerns over the effectiveness of the Phillips Curve, and you’ve got conditions of substantial uncertainty that could force the Fed to wait and see before cutting rates to minimize the chance of a policy error.  Put another way, we may be nearing the Fed’s peak squeeze pressure on the economy, but are still uncertain how long the squeeze will last. So far the economy appears to be resilient and in good spirits, but the inflationary temperament remains. The Fed doesn’t appear to have as strong of a read on the economic pulse as it once did, which is muddled by market distortions and supply chain reverberations caused by the coronavirus pandemic. We can only hope the Fed decisively catches the economy if the patient suddenly collapses.  - Todd Groth, CFA, head of index research at CoinDesk Indices  Takeaways  From CoinDesk’s Nick Baker, here’s some recent news worth reading:  NO DOLLARS: News that Binance was shutting off deposits and withdrawals in U.S. dollars caused quite the stir. The crypto exchange didn’t specify why it was doing this, but crypto businesses have long struggled to maintain ties to conventional banks. And regulators are signaling reluctance about linking crypto to the traditional financial system. For instance, the Federal Reserve recently denied crypto bank Custodia’s application for Fed system membership.  NICE STAKE: In September the Ethereum Merge, as is well known by now, brought in a new era for that major crypto ecosystem, shifting it to being run by a proof-of-stake (PoS) system from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) technique that Bitcoin pioneered. There was a shortcoming, however: You can stake your ETH, but you can’t currently get it back by unstaking it. But that deficiency is looking more likely to go away soon, following a successful test this week of withdrawing staked ETH.  POUND SAND: As headlines proclaim the potential arrival of a “Britcoin,” the Bank of England wants there to be no confusion: if it issues a digital pound, it will be nothing like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “Indeed, nothing could be further from the truth,"" Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said.  BOWLED OVER: If you watched the Super Bowl a year ago, crypto’s presence was unavoidable. There was that Larry David commercial for FTX, plus more from other crypto companies.

January saw a broad rebound in token prices across the layer 1 blockchain landscape alongside improved fundamental metrics. January price action finally brought some relief to metaverse investors as token prices soared across the board. Small-caps stood out amid the January digital assets rally, as emerging markets powered crypto gains to start the year strong. Digital assets rallied sharply in January after the Bitcoin price registered the most severe oversold condition ever. Risk appetite rebounded as inflation fell, the dollar fell, and bonds rallied. For the month, the Nasdaq composite rose 11%, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) +39%, and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) +33%. Small-cap crypto assets rallied even more. We noted last month that Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility was abnormally low and likely to mean revert. We highlighted four positive and four negative catalysts. Two of our four negative catalysts appear off the table for now, with the Genesis standalone bankruptcy and CFIUS approving Binance’s ( BNB-USD ) acquisition of $1B of Voyager customer assets. On the positive side, we had been expecting momentum in the Middle East, which materialized in the form of the largest ever Bitcoin mining project in the region (250MW, $400M0, a joint venture involving publicly traded Marathon Digital ( MARA ) in Abu Dhabi). We expect Saudi to follow later this year as crypto licenses may be granted alongside the setup of special economic zones . We also recently highlighted the high correlation between RMB strength and the Bitcoin price , which has persisted amidst China’s economic rebound. US-based investors seem keenly aware that money supply growth has stagnated stateside. However, global money supply has re-accelerated, driven by Asia, home to six of the top 10 countries on Chainalysis’ crypto adoption index. Indeed, Bitcoin price returns in January were much more robust during Asia trading hours than U.S. or European, perhaps evidence that liquidity in the region is finding Bitcoin and other digital assets.

Smart Contract Platforms January saw a broad rebound in token prices across the layer 1 blockchain landscape alongside improved fundamental metrics. Compared to the month of December, important indicators of blockchain usage and profitability, such as Daily Active Addresses and Monthly Revenues were up 11% and 44.7% across all blockchains we track. The top price performers of the month included Aptos , Solana ( SOL-USD ) , and Near ( NEAR-USD ), whose trailing 30-Day returns were 419%, 144%, and 88%, respectively. Amongst the winners, Solana and Near saw significant month-to-month increases in usership, with Solana's Daily Active Addresses up 45% while Near’s were up 38%. Price increases also came amid several sustained short squeezes, particularly in Aptos and Solana, which saw the short interest costs approach nearly 100% and 300%, respectively, on an annual basis. The weakest performers included Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ) , Ethereum, and BNB, whose gains were 42%, 33%, and 25%, respectively. The price action in Cosmos can be attributed to community disappointment amid the lack of progress toward implementing its value accrual mechanism called ICS (interchain security). On the other hand, Ethereum’s price action likely relates to improved risk appetite pushing participants further out the risk curve. Ethereum Daily Active Addresses fell 10% during the month. Binance’s BNB token also underperformed as lackluster fee growth (2%) and a 23% drop in Daily Active Addresses marked it as one of the only L1 protocols without improving on-chain fundamentals for the month of January. In terms of aggregate fees, Ethereum has continued to dominate the market since the Merge (September 15, 2022). In the month following the merge, Ethereum took an average share of 75% of all layer 1 blockchain fees; in January 2023, ETH accounted for 86% of fees. This paradigm not only reflects Ethereum's strength but also shows the relative economic decline of competing L1s due to the cheapness of Ethereum block space and the rise of Ethereum L2s. Binance was a distant second in January with 12% of all fees, while Solana took third place with 0.84% of all fees. Layer 1 Monthly Fee Growth Source: Artemis as of 1/31/2023.

When assessing L1 blockchains, it is important to consider if each chain generates more from transaction fees than it emits in inflationary token issuance. If blockchains were considered businesses, transaction fees would constitute revenues, whereas inflationary issuance would be expenses. This is because the main purpose of inflationary issuance is to pay validators for providing security. Thus, transaction fees, less issuance, would approximate profits. Two smart contract blockchains can currently be considered profitable – Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH). On the other hand, none of the other major chains are even close to covering their security costs at current usage rates. While Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) and Cosmos are technically Layer-0s whose tokens accrue value by means other than transaction revenue, the other noteworthy smart contract blockchains are far from covering their costs. The closest smart contract platform to achieving profitability is Fantom ( FTM-USD ), whose security budget exceeds its revenue by ~$31.5M per year. Likewise, if we were to consider ROE (which we define as trailing 100-day fees, annualized, divided by current market cap), Fantom would also be the least unprofitable of the bunch, followed by Cardano ( ADA-USD ). Cardano’s relatively less negative ROE may explain why it maintains a high market capitalization, ~$13.5B, compared to its relatively small userbase, around 70k Daily Active Addresses. To extend the ROE argument further, it would appear that Cardano and Fantom are two chains that are nearest to profitability. As a result, they merit increased scrutiny as they could be “sleeper” picks for 2023 if either starts to gain momentum in user traction.

Metaverse January price action finally brought some relief to metaverse investors as token prices soared across the board. Decentraland’s MANA ( MANA-USD ) had the best monthly performance of the top virtual world tokens, notching a 150% gain in January, while APE ( APE-USD ) and SAND ( SAND-USD ) appreciated 60% and 92%, respectively. MANA’s lower, fully diluted valuation likely explains its outperformance as it is currently valued 25% lower than SAND despite a roughly equal number of daily users. Gaming tokens also rallied with the rest of the crypto market, with Treasure DAO’s MAGIC ( MAGIC-USD ) recording a 153% gain in January. Treasure DAO has built a gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum . Their token’s performance can be attributed to growing investor interest in dapps built on Ethereum scaling solutions and the DAO announcing that it would release 10 new games in 2023. In previous newsletters, we highlighted that Yuga Labs would likely release new developments to prevent APE stakers from dumping their token rewards, and in January, they did that. In the middle of the month, Yuga Labs allowed Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club holders to claim a “Sewer Pass,” which granted them access to a new mini-game coined “Dookey Dash.” Sewer Pass holders can play the game until February 8th, when the “Summoning” occurs. Few details have been released on the “Summoning,” but users anticipate they will likely be rewarded with an NFT that will have an important role in the Otherside metaverse. Since the Sewer Pass is tradable, holders could speculate on the value of the Summoning reward, and some have opted not to play and sold their Sewer Pass, which currently has a floor price of $3,800 on OpenSea. Yuga Labs also announced that their second metaverse demo or “trip” would be held in March. NFT markets had an exceptional month, with trading volume up 41% month-over-month and multiple bullish announcements in the space. Last month it was announced that the DeGods and Y00ts NFT collections would migrate to Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), and we speculated that more successful collections would launch projects on different blockchains. This month, Doodles announced they would launch their second collection, Doodles 2, on Flow and cited that the ease of wallet creation and additional on-chain customizability warranted the decision. Setting up a self-custody wallet has repeatedly been identified as a major pain point for attracting Web2 users. With this move, Doodles hopes to garner wider adoption from non-crypto native users like the NBA Top Shot collection did, which has generated over $1 billion in trade volume. Other notable NFT announcements included PROOF Collective, the brand behind the Moonbird collection, signing a deal with Hollywood’s United Talent Agency to help push the Moonbird brand into new markets, according to the project's founder, Kevin Rose. As the month ended, Blockworks reported that Amazon ( AMZN ) would launch a digital assets enterprise and release at least one NFT collection in collaboration with an artist in the spring. Finally, if you will be watching the upcoming NFL Super Bowl, be on the lookout for the Digi Daigaku commercial, as viewers will be able to scan a QR code in the commercial to mint a free Digi Dragon NFT.

42411239,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKnK,1675876868,A Pragmatic View of ChatGPT in a Web3 World,"ChatGPT has stolen the headlines as one of the most impressive technology releases of 2022. Initially unveiled to highlight the capabilities of the upcoming GPT-4, ChatGPT quickly transcended the boundaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) space to become a pop culture phenomenon. For the first time in history, we are seeing AI actively discussed all the way from mainstream media outlets to dinner conversations. The fact that an obscure area of AI was going to cause this revolution was unfathomable just a year ago.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock.  ChatGPT is the latest in a family of large generative language models (LLM) that are clearly transforming the nature of content creation, application development and user experience. The speculations of how ChatGPT and the upcoming GPT-4 type technologies might impact different industries have run high and wild and Web3 is not the exception.  The hype about the possibilities of ChatGPT have certainly found its way to the Web3 space. In recent weeks, crypto media outlets have openly discussed the role that ChatGPT can play in ending Google’s dominance, completely automating smart contract development and making Web3 the dominant architecture paradigm. A different perspective becomes apparent once you look into the specific capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT and match it to the current state of Web3 technologies.  Inside ChatGPT  For all the hype around ChatGPT, there has been very little discussion about the specific capabilities and differentiators of the model. ChatGPT represents a major evolution in OpenAI’s GPT family of models but that evolution has materialized in a very specific dimension. The main difference between ChatGPT and its predecessors is that the former is key at following instructions. Models like GPT-3 were able to perform a handful of language tasks such as summarization, question answering or text completion based on carefully curated prompts.  Read more: Here’s Why Artificial Intelligence Focused Cryptocurrencies Are Vastly Outperforming Bitcoin  However, GPT-3 exhibited major limitations following more generic instructions. In early 2022, OpenAI quietly unveiled InstructGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3 that uses a technique called reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to better follow human intents. OpenAI had published the research behind RLHF back in 2017 and went mostly unnoticed until InstructGPT was created. InstructGPT is the crown jewel at the center of ChatGPT and one of the key differentiators with its predecessors. These days, when you are using the OpenAI API by default it uses InstructGPT.  The AI community recently started referring to models such as ChatGPT with the term ""foundation models."" Quoted by Stanford University, this term refers to the unique characteristic of these models to be fine-tuned for specific scenarios. For instance, OpenAI created Codex, a new fine-tuned version of GPT-3 to generate programming language code that is powering programs such as GitHub CoPilot. Codex is also integrated into ChatGPT.  Now that we understand the core capabilities and differentiators of ChatGPT, we can extrapolate those to our Web3 universe and start dreaming about the potential.  ChatGPT in a Web3 world  The foundation model revolution with platforms such as ChatGPT is going to deeply influence how software is created and experienced across the entire technology market. Web3 also represents a new paradigm for distributed computing, so the combination with foundation models like ChatGPT offers a blank canvas full of opportunities. Some of those opportunities are already possible with today’s technologies.  Language-based explorers  Explorers are the search experience in Web3 and the core building block for human interactions with blockchains. However, the user experience of blockchain explorers is designed for domain experts. Imagine an explorer powered by a fine-tuned version of ChatGPT for blockchain activity. In that experience, a normal user could ask questions such as “Any large institutions transferring funds to Binance?,” “When was the last time something similar happened?” or “Are there any interesting patterns in the recent transaction activity?” Search is one of the experiences that might be reimagined with technologies like ChatGPT, and explorers could be a perfect candidate.  Smart contract development assistants  Programming smart contracts remains a highly sophisticated task for developers. ChatGPT components such as Codex are able to generate Solidity code from language descriptions. Imagine a smart contract assistant in which a developer can type something like “What’s the solidity code to request a flashloan in Aave?” and it will generate the corresponding smart contract code snippet.  Read more: Jesus Rodriquez - The Coming Convergence of NFTs and Artificial Intelligence  Smart contract security testing  Smart contract audits are slow, expensive and tedious processes that are nonetheless necessary. A large majority of the auditing process relies on executing tests that are quite often not obvious to smart contract developers. Imagine having a fine-tuned version of ChatGPT for smart contract audits that could take a language input such as “” and run a battery of tests in a given smart contract.  Intelligence NFTs  Arguably one of the most obvious applications of models such as ChatGPT is to enable a new generation of non-fungible tokens (NFT) that incorporate conversational intelligence. Imagine a version of your favorite NFT collection that allows you to ask questions about the creator’s inspiration or specific artistic details.  Conversational wallets  Wallets are the main entry point for interactions with decentralized applications (dapp) in the Web3 world. Just as the user experience in Web2 applications is being reimagined with foundational models such as ChatGPT as a fundamental construct, we can think of a similar trend for crypto wallets. Imagine a wallet experience in which a user can simply express its intentions to perform a transaction, request information or execute specific tasks simply using natural language. Conversation is going to be one of the most interesting trends in Web3 user experience in the next few years.  Web3 in a ChatGPT world  Foundational models such as ChatGPT will, undoubtedly, enable a new generation of capabilities in decentralized applications, but Web3 can play an interesting role in the infrastructure powering these models. Auditability is one of the key concerns around the emergence of models like ChatGPT. Understanding the causes of harmful, fake, unbiased or unfair content has been at the center of the debate for the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT and similar models. Distributed ledgers are the perfect technology to enable trustless transparency and auditability for models such as ChatGPT.  Pre-training and fine-tuning is another aspect in which Web3 platforms can contribute to models like ChatGPT. The computational requirements for pre-training or fine-tuning foundation models results are prohibited for most organizations. Decentralized computation networks such as blockchains can enable scalable computation economies that can facilitate the pre-training or fine-tuning of models like ChatGPT.  Not just ChatGPT  ChatGPT and the upcoming GPT-4 release represent some of the most overhyped technologies of the last few decades. While it might be easy to get caught up in the hype, the transformational impact of these models is real and it definitely applies to Web3. One thing to understand is that ChatGPT won’t stand alone in this area much longer.  Companies such as Google with its model LaMDA, DeepMind with Sparrow, Anthropic with Claude and Stability AI with an open-source version of ChatGPT are likely to become relevant players in this market in a next few months. In the Web3 world, these models will power new experiences for how to author and interact with smart contracts, dapps, Wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, NFTs and pretty much every area of the ecosystem.

42414509,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB8Fv8,1675874523,Deutsche Bank in Talks to Invest in 2 German Crypto Firms: Bloomberg,"The asset management group of German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG is in talks to invest in two German crypto companies as part of its growth strategy, according to a Bloomberg report.  People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Stefan Hoops, the CEO of the division, known as DWS Group, has entered into negotiations to buy a minority stake in Deutsche Digital Assets, a provider of exchange-traded products, as well as trading firm Tradias, which is owned by leading securities trading bank and market maker Bankhaus Scheich.

An earlier version of the story had Genesis Global Trading as the top creditor, which was incorrectly included by Coin Cloud in its initial filing.  Coin Cloud, which operates more than 4,000 bitcoin ATMs across the U.S. and Brazil, has filed for bankruptcy protection with estimated liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million.  The Las Vegas-based firm has assets of between $50 million and $100 million and as many as 10,000 creditors, according to a filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada dated Feb. 7.  The company's largest unsecured creditor is Genesis Global Capital, which lent just over $100 million to Coin Cloud last year, according to a separate filing. Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  Genesis also discussed injecting equity into the ATM operator, Bloomberg reported in November.

42411230,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKMs,1675873798,Aspiring Crypto Bank’s Plight Shows Binance’s Issues Are Just Part of the Story,"Two weeks ago, Caitlin Long-founded Custodia Bank (formerly Avanti Bank), which is not yet in operation, learned the U.S. Federal Reserve Board had denied its application for membership, which would have formalized an association with the general reputation of the U.S. central bank.  Then, this week Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trading volume, confirmed it was temporarily suspending U.S. dollar bank transfers as of Feb. 8. Almost none of Binance’s customers make U.S. dollar bank transfers, and Binance’s U.S. division is not affected by the suspension. So there may not be cause for concern.  But add a lawsuit filed against Signature Bank and then add crypto bank Juno halting and then restarting services after a vendor shut down operations – and suddenly there is plenty of online chatter about banks and crypto.  Now we can cue the public outcry.  It makes sense, in a way: Binance is one of the most recognizable brands in crypto, lawsuits against banks are big and flashy (especially when connected to FTX) and Juno offers FDIC-protected checking accounts.  Binance has had plenty of run-ins with U.S. regulators, so are we really surprised it is struggling with a U.S. banking relationship? The Signature lawsuit is just a lawsuit, and Matt Damon, Stephen Curry and Tom Brady know lots of people who have been sued in crypto, don’t they? And Juno is a crypto bank that offers interest on its FDIC-insured accounts, so is it shocking that something hurt its operational flow given how bad 2022 was?  No, not really. Where this does get surprising is when you add in Custodia. The news of its rejection by the Federal Reserve Board was more worthy of a reaction than all of these other stories combined.  Custodia does crypto banking differently: So what’s the problem?  At risk of sounding like Adam Neumann, Custodia is trying to do banking differently. The goal of Custodia (when it finally launches) is to act as a compliant bridge between digital assets and the U.S. dollar payments system. With that in mind, consider the Federal Reserve’s following statement in defense of its rejection of Custodia’s application:  “The firm's novel business model and proposed focus on crypto-assets presented significant safety and soundness risks. The Board has previously made clear that such crypto activities are highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.”  OK – that seems somewhat reasonable.  The “previously made clear” is a reference to a multi-agency joint statement from Jan. 3 that cited crypto’s many risks to the banking system including fraud, scams and inaccurate disclosures by crypto companies. The statement also cited other things including legal uncertainties related to custody practices, market volatility, stablecoin run risk, contagion risk and – my personal favorite – “risk of open, public, and/or decentralized networks or similar systems.”  Where it becomes unreasonable is when you consider Custodia’s stated strategy and mission and this sentence from the Fed’s rejection:  “It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system.”  But mitigating or controlling that risk is exactly what Custodia is trying to do. Custodia is a Wyoming-chartered Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI), which means it is a bank mostly engaged in the custody of assets, with its main focus on keeping assets safe and settling transactions efficiently. Very critically due to this designation as a SPDI, Custodia would be required to maintain unencumbered liquid assets (e.g., cash, U.S. Treasurys) valued at 100% or more of its deposits. For every dollar of deposits from its customers, Custodia would have at least one dollar in reserve.  Full reserves make a difference  What that means is, unlike almost all banks Custodia doesn’t need Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance – which protects a customer’s bank deposits from bank failures.  Although that sounds petrifying, it isn’t. The reason most banks need FDIC insurance is because they aren’t required to hold a dollar in reserve for every dollar of deposits. Almost all banks, certainly the biggest ones, practice fractional reserve banking where only a fraction of bank deposits are required to be available at all times for customer withdrawal. If that sounds petrifying, it’s because it sort of is. As we’ve learned, at our peril, it all works really well until it doesn’t.  If things get really bad and a bank is in trouble, customers will run to the bank to pull their money out. In fractional reserve banking, there might not be enough money available to be withdrawn. This triggers a bank run. Bank runs are bad.  Guess what? You can’t have a bank run if the assets are there. It really is that simple.  Without Custodia in this mix of bank-related crypto news, I’m not sure this piece of the news cycle would have anything worth paying close attention to for long. A lot of crypto is predicated on trading, gambling and “number-go-up technology” butting up against nebulous financial securities laws – so skittishness around Binance, Signature and Juno doesn’t raise eyebrows on its own.  Skittishness around a fully reserved bank that just so happens to service crypto businesses does.  This isn’t an advertisement for Custodia. It isn’t even an advertisement for full-reserve banking requirements. As a bitcoiner, I’m not likely to get close to advertising banks at all.  But I am advocating for more common-sense regulations. Why is this conversation even necessary? Crypto is not illegal, so a fully reserved, chartered bank looking to provide financial services to crypto companies should not be blocked from doing so.  Unless, of course, there is something else going on at the Federal Reserve or other agencies that makes them skittish to see, hear or read the word “crypto.”",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/08/aspiring-crypto-banks-plight-shows-binances-issues-are-just-part-of-the-story,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec79368400cb393da99b4b97f87e244d848e2a83-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414496,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB8Eo9,1675872730,Craig Wright Loses Bitcoin Copyright Claim in UK Court,"The file format of the Bitcoin blockchain can’t be protected by copyright, a U.K. judge has found, ruling against self-proclaimed inventor Craig Wright.  Wright, who says he wrote the 2008 Bitcoin white paper under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakomoto, had sought to argue he should be able to block the operation of Bitcoin and the system that forked from it, Bitcoin Cash, because they breach his intellectual property rights.  Wright's claim was made against a host of defendants associated with Bitcoin, including several units of crypto exchange Coinbase. Wright claims the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision blockchain he created from another Bitcoin fork is the authentic blockchain behind the bitcoin cryptocurrency.  In a Tuesday ruling, Judge James Mellor said the file format of Bitcoin – the sequence of a header and list of transactions that together form a block – can’t be treated like a literary work because Wright can’t show how they were first recorded, a test known in copyright law as ""fixation.""  “I do not see any prospect of the law as currently stated and understood in the case law allowing copyright protection of subject matter which is not expressed or fixed anywhere,” Mellor said in a ruling for the High Court of England and Wales.  “It remains the case that no relevant 'work' has been identified containing content which defines the structure of the Bitcoin File Format,” although Wright and the two Wright-associated investment companies making the claim had been given “ample opportunity” to do so, Mellor added.  Claims concerning copyright to the 2008 white paper and whether Wright is really the author will be the subject of later rulings, the judge said.  Last week the U.K. Court of Appeal ruled that a claim by Wright's Tulip Trading against 16 Bitcoin developers should go to trial in London.  In a case heard in Oslo last year, multiple witnesses offered forensic evidence that documents supplied by Wright purporting to back up his claim to be Nakomoto contain discrepancies, such as fonts that weren’t available at the time.

42414510,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB8G0R,1675872226,"Hermès Wins Trademark Lawsuit Against MetaBirkins NFTs, Setting Powerful Precedent for NFT Creators","After several days of deliberation, the nine-person jury in the copyright infringement trial between Hèrmes and non-fungible token (NFT) artist Mason Rothschild ruled Wednesday in favor of the French luxury brand.  The Hermès lawsuit involved Rothschild's MetaBirkins NFT collection. The jury awarded $133,000 in damages to Hermès, determining that Rothschild did, in fact, profit off Hermès' goodwill by producing NFTs based on the design house's Birkin bags.  The jury also decided the NFTs were not protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as Rothschild's lawyers had argued during the trial.  The case sets an important precedent for NFT creators and builds the framework for intellectual property (IP) law as it relates to digital creations. Down the line, creators like Rothschild might have to be more careful creating NFTs with other brands' IP to avoid future trademark lawsuits.  David Leichtman, Leichtman Law managing partner, told CoinDesk TV on Tuesday that the case wasn’t necessarily about Mason Rothschild’s use of the protected Birkin brand. Rather, it was about whether he intended to mislead consumers into believing the MetaBirkin NFTs were associated with Hermès’ flagship product.  “The question is, were [consumers] really going to be confused by the MetaBirkins, whether or not the relevant consuming audience for Hermès products would be confused by the defendant’s works,” said Leichtman.  Hermès filed suit against Rothschild in January 2022 after the Los Angeles-based artist released an NFT collection titled MetaBirkins based on the brand’s iconic Birkin handbag. In the filing, the fashion house claimed that Rothschild was ""stealing the goodwill in Hermès' famous intellectual property to create and sell his own line of products,"" which could create confusion among its consumer base.  Rothschild argued that his project was simply art that provided a larger commentary on the fashion industry, and that his artistic expression was protected by the First Amendment.  After a year of battling over trademark infringement allegations, the Hermès vs. Metabirkins lawsuit came to trial beginning Jan. 30.  Trying the case relied heavily upon the Rogers v. Grimaldi standard, also known as the Rogers test, which examines the balance between artistic expression and trademark infringement.  Over the course of the trial, Hermès and Rothschild brought in experts on trademark law and NFTs to provide testimonies that focused on consumer confusion as well as brand dilution.  In closing arguments on Monday, Hermès’ lawyer Oren Warshavsky reiterated that Rothschild’s MetaBirkin NFTs not only misled consumers into believing the two brands were related, but that the use of the Birkin name in the NFT collection weakened the Hermès’ brand.  After the verdict was released, Rothschild posted a Twitter thread about the precedent that the case will set for artists in the future in regards to creativity and IP.  ""Take nine people off the street right now and ask them to tell you what art is but the kicker is whatever they say will now become the undisputed truth,"" said Rothschild in a tweet. Later in the thread he continued, ""What happened today was wrong. What happened today will continue to happen if we don’t continue to fight. This is far from over.""

His remarks come as the collapse of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) late last year spurred calls for increased transparency in the space. In December 2022, auditing firm Mazars published a proof-of-reserves report on Binance and subsequently halted such reporting for crypto clients given the lack of understanding by the public. Binance is also using tools such as the Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves, a Binance spokesperson told Seeking Alpha in an emailed statement, ""because it provides our customers additional reassurance that their assets exist on the blockchain and are safely under the control of the exchange."" ""We will also continue to work to provide other technical solutions, such as zk-SNARKs, that will further demonstrate our healthy financial position,"" the spokesperson added. In the crypto industry, hiring an auditor for a firm's assets and liabilities is tough because of certain complications such as price volatility. It's a non-traditional space where big accountants aren't used to auditing. “It’ll take a longer time,” Foong told Bloomberg . “It shows you the limitations of the more traditional industries because there is a learning curve. Number one, it’s not their core competence. And number two, obviously there’s a lot of scrutiny if they get it wrong.” In December 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly increased its scrutiny of crypto firms' audited proof of reserves amid the fallout from FTX .",NEUTRAL,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3933589-binance-signals-full-audit-of-crypto-exchange-wont-happen-for-a-while-report?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9057472.jpeg

The exchange joins Binance, Bitpanda and Société Générale’s Forge unit in registering under what is one of the most sophisticated crypto regimes in the European Union.  In France, registration involves checks that the company has competent and reputable management and complies with money laundering norms.  Bitstamp, based in Luxembourg, London and New York, has already registered in Spain and Italy. The European crypto sector is currently awaiting the arrival of the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, MiCA, which imposes tough reserve and investor information requirements on crypto services such as wallets and exchanges.  Under proposals currently being discussed by French lawmakers in the wake of the FTX collapse, unregistered companies serving the French market would have to separate client assets and manage conflicts of interest – a tougher requirement intended to bridge the transition to MiCA.  In a statement emailed to CoinDesk, the global CEO of Bitstamp, Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux, said the company is ""very proud"" of its new status as a virtual asset provider in France.  ""France represents one of the most important markets for Bitstamp in Europe,"" Graftieaux said.

Davies and co-founder Su Zhu “have refused to meaningfully engage,” said a filing.

42410844,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1rb,1675861200,Will the SEC Convince a Court It’s Right to Label These Tokens as Securities?,"Lawyers have challenged a potentially consequential move from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to build a list of crypto tokens it considers unregistered securities.  Nine tokens – most of which traded at Coinbase (COIN) – were featured by the regulator in an insider-trading case against a former manager at the company. Many believe that maneuver has importance well beyond the enforcement action, because the cryptocurrency industry has been eager to settle the question of which digital assets may be regulated by the SEC as securities and which may be commodities regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The SEC appeared to be slowly answering that question token by token.  Now the regulator will have to defend the assertion in federal court that the nine tokens tied to the case should be considered securities, because lawyers for the ex-Coinbase employee, Ishan Wahi, filed an argument this week that the tokens weren’t securities and the agency shouldn’t be using one person’s enforcement action to decide “how major questions of law that loom over entire industries should be resolved.”  The SEC “is trying to seize broad regulatory jurisdiction over a massive new industry via an enforcement action against a 32-year-old former Coinbase employee and his kid brother,” the filing said.  The basis of their motion to dismiss the SEC’s charges is that the tokens – including Flexa’s AMP, RLY, POWR and LCX – don’t qualify under the legal definitions of securities.  “The term ‘investment contract’ requires – as the statute says – a contract,” the lawyers wrote. “But here there are no contracts, written or implied.”  The court filing contends that the tokens’ investors weren’t throwing their money into an “enterprise,” but just buying assets from a third party.  “The tokens’ value is driven by market forces, not managerial efforts – as evidenced by the fact that the tokens are almost all functional (i.e., they can operate without any centralized intermediary) and that each experiences wide price fluctuations, regardless of the status of the underlying platform,” according to the motion.  However, crypto commentator Bennett Tomlin noted on Twitter that the argument is “weak” that the tokens don’t rely on the entities behind them, suggesting, for instance, that “LCX very much relies on LCX dot-com.”  Another project, Rally, shut down its entire sidechain last week, stranding users’ non-fungible tokens, though the RLY token itself seemed unaffected.  A spokesman for the SEC didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did spokespeople from Coinbase.  “In the absence of a concrete digital asset securities regulatory framework from the SEC, we remain confident that Coinbase’s rigorous review process keeps securities off Coinbase’s platform,” the company’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, wrote in a blog post last year after the SEC’s action.  Patrick Daugherty, a lawyer who worked at the SEC and now represents crypto clients at Foley and Lardner in Chicago, called the latest filing an “exceptionally fine articulation of lawyerly objections to the progressive-left power grab that we are sadly witnessing in current SEC leadership.”  “One can only hope that the new chairman of the House Financial Services Committee will get some control over this wayward federal agency and that lower federal courts will recognize abuse of power when it’s pointed out to them,” said Daugherty, who also teaches about crypto at Cornell University’s law school.  As of last month, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) is running the House committee that oversees the SEC, and he’s made it clear that he’s planning heavy criticism for the way SEC Chair Gary Gensler is running the agency.  However, Kevin Werbach, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, isn’t convinced that this case will provide a significant legal framework for the SEC’s security definitions and may just be about proving one person’s violation of securities laws.  “I wouldn’t expect Wahi, which addresses the issue only indirectly, to be the central case in this area,” Werbach said in an email, saying the legal fight against Ripple will have the greatest weight. “The pending Ripple case, which has been very aggressively litigated, will either further reinforce the SEC’s position or throw a monkey wrench in the whole operation.”  Still, lawyers representing the crypto industry have been carefully studying any assertions from the agency that a crypto asset falls into the securities bucket. That situation rose again recently when the SEC labeled FTX’s exchange token, FTT, as a security, creating wider concerns that similar tokens issued by platforms such as Binance would be considered securities by that same logic.  The assertion shouldn’t surprise anyone who has tuned in to Gensler’s remarks.  “Of the nearly 10,000 tokens in the crypto market, I believe the vast majority are securities,” he said last year. The only digital asset his agency freely admits doesn’t fall into that category is bitcoin.

42414508,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB8FfD,1675861200,Crypto Classification Seeks to Make Industry More Welcoming to TradFi Participants,"Cryptocurrency data provider CoinGecko and 21.co, the parent firm of investment product provider 21Shares, are rolling out a classification system for crypto assets, the latest in a growing number of efforts to map the taxonomy of the industry and make it more accessible for participants in traditional finance (TradFi).  The Global Crypto Classification Standard, announced Wednesday, categorizes digital assets according to three levels. It joins a classification system called datonomy, constructed by financial services behemoths Goldman Sachs (GS) and MSCI (MSCI) with data provider Coin Metrics, and the Digital Assets Classification Standard (DACS) from CoinDesk Indices that classifies the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization into use case and technology and then into industry and sector.  The core of this trend is an attempt to impose structure on apparent chaos, and help guide conventional investors as they consider stashing money into crypto. There is a huge array of crypto assets, many of which have virtually nothing in common with each other, making the industry an intimidating one to enter.  “It is crucial as there are still many misconceptions regarding crypto from traditional finance institutions,” a 21.co spokesperson told CoinDesk. “The term ‘cryptocurrency,’ widely used, is a misnomer as crypto assets can vary dramatically in nature, both as it relates to the asset (token) itself and the protocol behind it.”  Understanding distinctions  The Global Crypto Classification Standard, for example, categorizes assets on three levels. The first deals with networks and protocols, be they cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, monero, etc), smart contract platforms (for example, Ethereum or Solana), decentralized apps (such as Aave, Uniswap) and so on. The second groups assets by industry and sector, including centralized finance, decentralized finance (DeFi), metaverse, identity and infrastructure. The third level deals identifies the nature of the assets: a cryptocurrency, a native currency of a particular network, a stablecoin, a derivative token, or a governance or utility token, and so on.  In short, the aim is to help companies and investors answer some basic questions about a network or protocol: What does it do? What type of token is associated with it? To what asset class does it belong?  Having the answers helps TradFi firms know what to expect when they enter a new asset class. It allows them to create index-linked products such as exchange-traded funds (ETF), which helps to attract investors who prefer passive rather than active exposure to an asset or basket of assets.  On Tuesday, for example, digital asset management platform HeightZero used CoinDesk Indices’ Large Cap Select Index, which provides a weighted performance of the largest digital assets, to offer crypto exposure to its clients in the financial advisory and wealth management spheres.  Read more: Digital Asset Management Platform HeightZero Taps CoinDesk Indices to Offer Crypto Basket to Financial Advisers  The value such products offer is illustrated by last year’s collapse of crypto exchange FTX and lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital. All of those operated as centralized platforms. In contrast, many DeFi lending protocols continued with business as normal, offering an alternative investment opportunity if only it can be identified.  That’s what products such as these are looking to provide.

42411224,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMJzj,1675859400,Contentious Uniswap Vote Highlights the Opaqueness of Decentralized Governance,"When Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) invested in the decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap, it earned a massive trove of the project’s UNI tokens – crypto assets that double as votes in the exchange’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  The venture capital firm’s ownership of those tokens – and the votes it controls – are suddenly at the center of a crypto debate over how decentralized Uniswap really is. On Twitter and elsewhere, some industry observers and stakeholders in the project are asking whether there is a potential conflict of interest given a16z’s stakes in multiple projects that might benefit from a business relationship with Uniswap.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Last week, in a community poll that was viewed as crucial in a cut-throat race between crypto infrastructure platforms, the Uniswap DAO selected a crypto “bridge” called Wormhole as a key part of its infrastructure for a planned expansion to Binance’s BNB blockchain.  Unlike official, “on-chain” DAO votes that can automatically execute blockchain code when they pass, this one, hosted on the website Snapshot.org, was a more informal “temperature check.”  A16z didn’t cast a vote in the “temperature check” poll, and its absence from the tally may have cost LayerZero, one of its portfolio companies, the highly coveted spot. (A16z later clarified that it would have voted for LayerZero, but that it was unable to participate for technical reasons.)  Now an official vote is pending on whether to ratify Wormhole’s selection, and a16z has voted against it. A key question is whether the firm should be allowed to derail or delay Uniswap’s effort to move forward with its expansion to prevent LayerZero’s competitor from gaining an advantage.  So far, a16z has used 15 million UNI tokens to vote against the proposal – not enough to block it from passing. In other words, the entire issue might be moot in this case.  But the issue raises the question of how things might have played out differently if a16z had made full use of its voting powers.  The venture firm’s 15 million UNI represents just a fraction of its total holdings. A representative for a16z tells CoinDesk that it has “delegated” over 40 million additional tokens to third parties – many of whom voted against a16z in this week’s vote. Theoretically, a16z could, in future votes, reclaim those UNI tokens, and the votes, for itself.  If a16z loses this week’s Uniswap vote – which currently seems likely – it will not prove that the Uniswap DAO has lived up to its “decentralized” governance ethos. Instead, it will only prove that a16z has chosen to exercise self-restraint rather than draw attention to the full weight of its influence within Uniswap’s decentralized ecosystem. Moreover, the example of a16z and Uniswap underscores how little we know about how power is distributed in the pseudonymous world of decentralized governance.  A16z’s Uniswap DAO vote mishap  Uniswap DAO is currently facing a time crunch: If it doesn’t deploy Uniswap V3 onto Binance’s BNB blockchain before Apr. 1, its business license will expire, and other companies will be allowed to clone its code to launch competitors.  To move onto BNB Chain, Uniswap DAO first needed to vote to select a bridge platform – a piece of infrastructure that allows users to communicate from one chain to another and, in Uniswap's case, form the backbone of its governance apparatus.  Uniswap DAO’s governance process frequently feels more procedural than anything else, with most proposals garnering limited community discussion and near-unanimous approval.  “One of the largest issues in governance is voter apathy,” said David Shuttleworth, director of token engineering at Binance’s VC arm, Binance Labs. “Maybe you get 10% turnout, and a lot of those votes are not highly contested.”  Against this backdrop, the Uniswap-BNB bridge vote was uncharacteristically contentious.  “I think a lot of the community believes rightly or wrongly that the bridge protocol that Uniswap uses for BNB Chain will be adopted by other systems,” Robert Leshner, the founder of the crypto lending platform Compound, told CoinDesk. Given its perceived importance, the race drew a wave of attention as competitors and stakeholders debated the security and flexibility of competing bridge platforms on Uniswap community forums.  The Wormhole bridge won the vote, earning 62% versus a16z-backed LayerZero’s 38%.  But a16z complicated the tally at the last minute, stating in a community forum post just before polls closed that it was unable to participate due to vague technical constraints having to do with a custody service that it uses to hold its UNI.  “We’re unable to vote in the current Snapshot due to infrastructure limitations with the custodian on short notice,” wrote Porter Smith, an a16z partner. A representative for a16z would not clarify the technical constraints any further for CoinDesk.  “To be totally unambiguous, we at a16z would have voted 15m tokens toward LayerZero if we were technically able to,” said Eddy Lazzarin, a16z’s head of engineering, in another Uniswap forum post the day after the vote closed. “So, for the purposes of a ‘temperature check,’ please count us this way.”  A16z recently led a $135 million investment round into LayerZero.  Uniswap's governance policies explicitly define the process by which polls like this one are supposed to operate. In accordance with those rules, the Uniswap Foundation – a non-profit organization tasked with managing the day-to-day operations of Uniswap’s governance machine (among other things) – said in a forum post that a16z’s uncast votes would not be counted.  A16z votes its bags  The a16z drama grew more intense when the official “on-chain” vote to bring Uniswap to BNB Chain opened to voters on Feb. 2.  A16z is the largest voting entity on Uniswap, and its 15 million UNI tokens, voted “against” the proposal, were enough, for a brief period last weekend, to tilt the vote nearly 70% against the BNB Chain deployment.  A16z representatives say the firm’s votes were cast against the proposal because of concerns about Wormhole’s security.  “We do not believe Wormhole offers the most secure or decentralized bridging option,” an a16z representative said in a forum post explaining the decision. (Wormhole did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.) Also – despite supporting LayerZero in the previous vote – a16z said that it now believed the DAO should hold off on selecting a bridge partner until a “formal assessment is completed.”  Not everyone was convinced by a16z’s rationale. To some, it seemed as if the VC firm was willing to hold Uniswap’s expansion objectives hostage in order to achieve a favorable outcome for LayerZero, its portfolio company.  These allegations highlight a key tension in the governance of decentralized protocols: Should DAO voters elect in favor of their self-interest or should they optimize solely for the protocol that they are governing?  Leshner, currently the third-largest voter in the Wormhole BNB vote, said he voted “yes” on the BNB Chain proposal even though he believes that LayerZero is superior to Wormhole. He is, alongside a16z, a LayerZero investor.  “I just want to see the thing deployed and not go through this extended governance period,” Leshner told CoinDesk. “I think what's most important is Uniswap being deployed onto BNB Chain period, full stop, and there's already a solution that's proposed and ready to go.”  How much power does a16z have?  Crypto Twitter seized on the a16z controversy for what the situation implied about the role of big money in the governance of a core, “decentralized” crypto pillar.  “Uniswap controlled by a16z?” tweeted Chanpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance. (Binance is, ironically enough, reportedly the second-largest UNI holder, though an Ethereum address associated with the exchange has never voted on a Uniswap proposal.).  A representative for a16z told CoinDesk that it delegates a large amount of its UNI votes to independent third parties. It does this, the representative says, to ensure that Uniswap’s governance system remains decentralized. Among the third parties named by the representative were organizations like GFXLabs – which voted against a16z and in favor of launching Uniswap onto BNB Chain using Wormhole.  But the delegation defense leads to another question: How many UNI tokens does a16z hold in total?  According to a tweet from Lazzarin, a16z’s head of engineering, “We delegate ~40m votes to outside groups (with no conditions on how they vote).” Lazzarin did not specify the full size of a16z’s UNI holdings and neither did the representative that spoke to CoinDesk. But based on Lazzarin’s tweets, a16z owns at least 55 million UNI in all, counting the tokens it has delegated. The a16z representative told CoinDesk that its agreements with delegates theoretically allow the firm to re-claim its delegated tokens should it so choose.  With 55 million UNI, a16z would have had enough votes to throw any previous Uniswap proposal in its favor. (Just 65 million UNI have been cast so far in the Uniswap-BNB vote, and the largest-ever Uniswap DAO vote received 85 million votes in total.)  Just as a16z does not disclose the full size of its Uniswap holdings, neither do other parties. It is impossible to know who, exactly, has influence within Uniswap’s governance ecosystem. And this is unlikely to change. A person familiar with Uniswap Foundation leadership told CoinDesk that anonymity is a core feature of crypto culture, so it’s hard to imagine that the DAO would ever force all UNI holders to disclose who they are.  As the DAO space matures and protocol governance decisions become more contentious and lucrative, one expects that the money behind protocols like Uniswap will come under further scrutiny.",NEGATIVE,UNI | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | UNI | BNB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/08/contentious-uniswap-vote-highlights-the-opaqueness-of-decentralized-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8902011be59dfd03cdb0063039684a8af8becc39-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Toronto-based firm was able to pay for the plant with cash, so avoided taking on debt or diluting existing shareholders' equity, CEO Michel Amar said in a Wednesday press release. In March 2021, the company said it would pay $4.25 million in cash and stock. It hadn't responded to requests about the final price by publication time.  By securing a power generation asset, Digihost can better control its energy costs and sell power to the grid at times of peak demand. However, input costs will depend on the variable cost of natural gas.  The plant is capable of generating 60 MW, bringing the firm's energy capacity to 100 MW, or about 2 exahash/second (EH/s) of mining computing power. The initial power generation run rate will be about 50 MW, it said in a January statement.  Environmental groups have filed a lawsuit over the approval of the power plant sale. They argue that the plant will work 24/7, thus ""increasing its greenhouse gas emissions up to 3,500% even as the rest of New York works to drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.""  Digihost ""believes that year round, the plant will continue to provide electrical power to the grid on demand in order to meet customers needs during extreme weather conditions and will also continue to run the plant as a peaker plant,"" according to the January statement.

42414513,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB8FkW,1675852490,FTX Lawyers Sullivan & Cromwell Bill $7.5M for First 19 Days' Bankruptcy Work,"Law firm Sullivan & Cromwell billed $7.5 million for work on the FTX bankruptcy case in November, a period covering just 19 days, a Tuesday court filing shows.  The firm – whose appointment raised qualms from U.S. lawmakers as well as the Department of Justice, the U.S. Trustee involved in the FTX bankruptcy and even FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried – had more than 150 staffers working on filings, investigating hacks and reestablishing corporate governance arrangements for a network of over 100 entities.  “The services performed by S&C during the Fee Period represent one of the most complicated, multi-disciplinary exercises by any law firm in any area of law,” said the filing, which covers fees and expenses from Nov. 12 to Nov. 30.  A total of over 6,500 hours were worked by 32 partners, 85 associates and 34 nonlegal staff, the filing said. Hourly rates are as high as $2,165. The company said charges for senior staff already represent a discount, and the firm is seeking payment of only 80% of a $9.5 million total.  Read more: New FTX CEO Charged Crypto Exchange $690K Last Year: Hearing  Bankman-Fried, a bipartisan group of senators, and the U.S. Trustee are among those who have raised conflict-of-interest concerns about the firm’s involvement. (The U.S. Trustee is a branch of the Department of Justice dealing with bankruptcy matters). They cited the fact that S&C did $8.5 million of work for the company in the 16 months prior to bankruptcy, and that its former partner Ryne Miller is now FTX general counsel.  John J. Ray III, who took over as chief executive officer on Nov. 11, has said S&C is a “one of the leading law firms in the world” in relevant areas and that retaining it is in the best interest of FTX and its stakeholders.  The fee statement shows the drain that bankruptcy proceedings will represent on the estate of the corporate group as it seeks to reorganize and restore funds to creditors. That may prove especially complicated and costly if allegations concerning poor governance and weak cybersecurity controls under Bankman-Fried are true.  Later Wednesday, bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey will decide whether to appoint an independent examiner for the case, which FTX has warned could cost as much as $100 million and duplicate Sullivan & Cromwell’s work.  A spokesperson for S&C did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The jurisdiction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) published its long-awaited crypto regulations, which sets licensing and authorization requirements for virtual asset companies and issuers looking to operate in Dubai.

Regulators in other jurisdictions like Japan have also taken steps to prohibit privacy-enhancing crypto. The European Union is also considering prohibiting tokens that hinder traceability.

42412932,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl70dw,1675846898,"Three Arrows’ Founder Refused to Comply With Subpoena, Stonewalling Probe, Court Told","Kyle Davies refused to comply with a court subpoena for the books and records of his former crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, a New York court was told in a Tuesday night filing.  Davies was accused of stonewalling a probe into the company, which managed as much as $3 billion in assets before collapsing last year, while “shamelessly” promoting new crypto ventures.  Davies and co-founder Su Zhu “have refused to meaningfully engage,” said a filing on behalf of Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer, who now represent the bankrupt company. Davies and Zhu “have made only selective and piecemeal disclosures” and “refusal to cooperate violates their duties owed to Three Arrows,” it added.  Farmer and Crumpler attempted to serve a court-approved subpoena to Davies via Twitter on Jan. 5, but were ignored despite Davies’ active social media presence, the document said.  “He has not even attempted to reach out to undersigned counsel to voice an objection or concern with the topics of the subpoena,” the filing said. “This is not a question of partial compliance, but of no compliance whatsoever.”  “All the while, Mr. Davies has continued to post on his Twitter account, openly ignoring the Court’s directives and enjoying media attention while he continues to thwart efforts by the Foreign Representatives to gain access to documents and information,” the filing said.  Three Arrows’ collapse in June heralded a new crypto winter. Companies with exposure such as Voyager Digital, Celsius and Genesis Asia Pacific (which, like CoinDesk, is part of the Digital Currency Group) have since filed for bankruptcy, and Three Arrows’ new management takes a dim view of reports that Zhu and Davies are now apparently already looking to new ventures.  “Shamelessly, while ducking his obligations to his failed company, Mr. Davies has been recently active in an effort to raise tens of millions to start a new crypto exchange called ‘GTX,’” the filing said.  Farmer and Crumpler are seeking to compel Davies to comply with the subpoena, a request due to be considered at a March 2 hearing.  Counsel for Davies and Zhu did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment. In a January interview with CNBC, Davies said he had been “contactable the entire time” and “cooperating the whole way,” and denied that he was in Indonesia due to its weak extradition laws with the U.S.  Read more: Three Arrow Capital's Zhu, Davies Subpoenaed in US Bankruptcy Case",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/08/three-arrows-founder-refused-to-comply-with-subpoena-stonewalling-probe-court-told,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a81ea42f6032f06a59915732e16c87b91bae969d-5322x3934.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393919,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc4PV,1675846800,UK Crypto Firms and Regulator Blame Each Other for Industry Exodus,"A majority of crypto companies that once tried to register with the U.K.’s financial regulator have had to shut down or move their business out of the country. Many of those that left are still serving customers in the country from elsewhere.  New proposed rules could put a stop to that because planned requirements promise to mandate all crypto companies – local and foreign – to be registered and set up locally if they want to serve U.K. customers. But until those rules kick in and set clear standards, the country’s financial regulator and the crypto firms vying for its approval are doomed to be locked in a metaphorical tug of war.  Since January 2020 crypto exchanges and custody providers operating in the U.K. have needed to register with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and comply with its anti-money laundering rules to be able to serve U.K clients. The regulator this year revealed it had received 300 applications from prospective crypto firms, but only 41 had managed to win approval so far.  Although the idea was to restrict unregistered firms from serving local clients, some companies that moved abroad are still providing services to U.K. customers. The exodus suggests crypto companies would prefer to operate in a more relaxed regulatory environment rather than comply with the Financial Conduct Authority’s strict disclosure and reporting requirements. Despite the FCA’s stated goals, they are able to do so.  But some of the companies that didn’t end up receiving full approval with the FCA argue the registration process was made difficult by long wait times, a lack of feedback and – as some described – unfair treatment by the regulator.  “Some companies have actually very sadly told me that they've sort of given up in the process and gone elsewhere,” Lisa Cameron, chair of a cross-party parliamentary group for crypto in the U.K., told CoinDesk in a January interview. “Those companies are large companies who want to do the right thing and want to engage in a very constructive way.”  CoinDesk spoke to 17 crypto companies, lawyers, consultants and lobbyists about the FCA’s crypto registration regime. Representatives from exchanges Exmo, GlobalBlock, CEX and Bittylicious confirmed to CoinDesk that their companies had decided to serve U.K. clients from elsewhere after failing to register with the FCA.  The FCA has said it’s not to blame. Many firms that failed the registration process did not provide sufficient evidence they had robust anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing systems in place, FCA Director of Payments and Digital Assets Matthew Long said during an interview with Barron’s Live on Jan. 19.  “We work with crypto firms throughout the process to make sure they understand our expectations and provide feedback on their application,” the FCA said in a December email to CoinDesk. “Thirty-nine crypto firms have already gained registration, which shows these standards are achievable.”  Of the 300 applications the FCA received, 195 were either refused (following a full assessment) or withdrawn, while 29 were rejected before they were assessed, the regulator said in late January. In a few instances, the FCA even reported applicants to law enforcement agencies over suspicion of criminal activity.  Louise Abbott, a partner at Keystone Law, said she had worked with several clients that had been scammed by at least five crypto companies that tried and failed to register with the FCA.  “Many applications are rejected for authorization by the FCA but, as their letter states, that is because a large number of entities cannot get themselves with the regulatory regime – this doesn’t mean there is criminal activity, but the exposure is significantly higher,” Abbott said in an email to CoinDesk.  On Jan. 26, the FCA published tips and advice on its website detailing what it expects from companies if they are to win the regulator’s approval. Firms must show a detailed business plan that focuses on compliance oversight and risk mitigation, and have policies, systems and controls in place to appropriately manage and mitigate risk.  It could get worse for crypto firms because the government’s proposed rules – open to public comment till April – would make it mandatory for companies that successfully registered with the FCA to apply for new authorization and go through more thorough checks.  Read more: UK’s FCA Issues Advice for Crypto Firms After Only 41 of 300 Applicants Win Regulatory Approval  Shortcomings  Firms that now serve U.K. clients from elsewhere told CoinDesk the FCA may have been struggling with staffing issues that caused delays in the vetting process.  Lawyers Jill Lorimer from Kingsley Napley and Asim Arshad from Mackrell Solicitors – who have handled company applications for a total of more than 10 exchanges – said it took over a year to process some company applications. The process should have taken around three months, according to Philip Creed, director at FSCOM, a compliance consulting firm, who has worked with 20 crypto companies. Recently, lawmakers have also begun scrutinizing FCA staffing and resources.  Richard Kay, chief compliance officer of Exmo, a firm that did not successfully register with the FCA, and Benoit Marzouk, CEO of Bitcoin Point, which did, confirmed to CoinDesk they experienced delays in processing their applications.  Representatives of two other crypto firms said they had multiple case officers from the FCA handling their registration, possibly due to staffing problems.  “We have seen multiple occasions where [a] firm has not had the same case officer throughout the process. On some occasions three or four case officers have been involved. This is difficult for the FCA and firms to manage, as when a new case officer is appointed, they are having to get up to speed,” Creed said.  This is a normal occurrence for the FCA and “can always have a knock-on effect on the time taken to get to a stage when there is an outcome in place,” James Alleyne, legal director at law firm Kingsley Napley, who previously worked at the FCA told CoinDesk in an interview in January.  The FCA has been hiring more people for its crypto team lately, but the industry seems to also be “poaching many of their people,” Cameron said at the November Financial Times crypto event. Compliance hiring tripled for some crypto companies early last year as more regulations came into the space off the back of a crypto bull market.  Spokespeople from two companies who spoke to CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from the FCA, said the regulator was not always reasonable in the way it assessed crypto registration applications, and in some cases came across as hostile.  Seven crypto professionals, including Lorimer, Kay and Adam Jackson, director of policy at FinTech lobby group Innovate Finance, told CoinDesk that when the FCA started its registration regime, the regulator was simply not ready for the barrage of applications that came its way.  Two company representatives who spoke to CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from the FCA, said the regulator was not always reasonable in assessing crypto applications. They said that the FCA was looking for excuses to get crypto firms to leave because they were not ready to oversee the sector when they started the registration regime.  Crypto companies also felt the FCA did not provide adequate feedback during the application process when applying, Cameron said in early January.  Exodus  After trying and failing to register with the FCA, some companies had no choice but to shut down or move operations to another country. Thanks to a regulatory loophole, some of these firms are still serving U.K. customers.  “Many firms have set up somewhere else and on occasion are still offering services to U.K. customers,” said Creed.  Crypto exchange Bittylicious dropped out of the FCA’s temporary registration regime (TRR), which was designed to let companies continue operations in the U.K. while working towards full approval, and moved to the Isle of Man, according to its CEO Marc Warne.  ""Indeed, we do serve all clients around the world apart from sanctioned countries from the Isle of Man, including U.K. customers,"" Warne said in a written statement to CoinDesk.  Warne said in November that his company would consider moving back to the U.K. if he felt like regulators were “assessing crypto companies from a neutral perspective” instead of assuming they are guilty of wrongdoing.  U.K.-based CEX.IO, which dropped off the TRR regime on May 31, 2022 is serving its U.K. customers through its British Virgin Islands subsidiary, said Jonathan Wykes, managing director for U.K. and Europe at CEX.IO in a statement last year.  Binance, which tried to register with the FCA, withdrew its application in June 2021 partway through the process. The FCA said in August that the exchange had complied with its requirements but “was not capable of being effectively supervised.”  Daniel Trinder, Binance’s vice president of government affairs in Europe, told U.K. lawmakers in November that the company still served people based in the U.K. via binance.com.  Read more: FCA Said Binance Had Complied With Its Requirements, But Was 'Not Capable' of Being Supervised  Operating in a gray area  Existing rules do not prevent firms from providing services to U.K. customers from abroad, where regulators may have a more relaxed approach.  “The money laundering regulations are not clear on … whether having customers based in the U.K. is enough to require registration,” Creed said.  The FCA’s guidance could be interpreted as the requirement for registration falling only on firms that have a physical presence in the country, according to Creed.  “This means firms without a U.K. presence could legally be allowed to offer their services to U.K. residents,” Creed said, adding that he believes firms offering services to local customers should be required to register with the FCA.  But the ambiguity could be damaging to customers, Abbott said.  “Taking FTX as an example, that business did not need to be regulated here in the U.K. As such, there are no powers to ensure regulatory or corporate compliance/control, so the risk of fraud or criminal activity is increased,” she added.  The long-awaited consultation published on Feb. 1 proposes laws that will force companies that serve U.K. clients from abroad to register with the FCA and potentially set up a local subsidiary.  Read more: UK Crypto Firms to Get Broad Laws – May Need New Authorization  Meanwhile, the FCA has in some cases allowed companies some room to adjust to its requirements. Maria Stankevich, chief business development officer of Exmo, told CoinDesk last year that the FCA let the company serve its existing U.K. clients from its Lithuania branch, but it was not allowed to reach out to new ones.  Exmo applied for registration as a U.K.-based firm with clients from all over the world, but was told to reapply with a company that serves only the U.K., Kay said.  GlobalBlock, which left the TRR regime in May 2022, has an office and some staff in London, but mainly serves its U.K. clients from its entity in Lithuania, a spokesperson said. In February, the company issued a statement saying that after 20 months of limited communication, the FCA had issued the company a warning which suggested it was going to refuse its application at the time.  “We are naturally disappointed with the FCA process as it is being currently applied,” said Rufus Round, the then-CEO of the company, in the February statement.  GlobalBlock is planning on reapplying with the FCA in early 2023, a spokesperson said.  The FCA said it does not comment on individual cases.  It takes two  Although industry players feel the FCA could have handled the registration regime better, some argue that companies should have been more prepared.  Though the FCA had to engage with complex crypto businesses, firms had to get to grips with a registration regime that was more rigorous than they expected it to be, Lorimer said.  Creed and Jackson said that crypto firms were not ready to apply for FCA approval. He said that some companies needed to do more business-wide risk assessments to highlight areas they are vulnerable and fill those gaps.  A few companies said that after their experience with the FCA they were not willing to try again unless they saw serious change.  “But in life, if you give up when things get tough you're never going to succeed,” Exmo’s Kay said about applying to register with the FCA. The company confirmed in November that they submitted their second application two months prior but have heard nothing. As of Feb.1, the company was not registered with the FCA.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/08/uk-crypto-firms-and-regulator-blame-each-other-for-industry-exodus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e9a184c0494019130612a0bf216c2c99b116c8e-5540x3152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410883,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs2BR,1675842933,Here’s Why Artificial Intelligence Focused Cryptocurrencies Are Vastly Outperforming Bitcoin,"Crypto markets are known to be fueled by narratives, and artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest trend.  Prominent traders on Crypto Twitter are heralding AI-based tokens as the sector that might lead the next bull market cycle. They may be right so far: Such tokens are up an average of 80% in the past week alone, CryptoSlate data shows.  Among the biggest gainers have been tokens for platforms such as Alethea's artificial liquid intelligence (ALI), fetch.ai (FET) and SingularityNET (AGIX), which have surged as much as 220%, as CoinDesk previously reported.  The tokens of AI-based upstarts like Image Generation AI (IMGNAI) have more than tripled over a two-week period. The protocol allows users to generate artwork using text disruptions on social platforms such as Discord.  One-time popular tokens from 2018 and 2021, such as Big Data Protocol (BDP) and Measurable Data (MDT), seem to have jumped on the hype with tweets that seem to remind investors of how they utilize AI technology within their blockchain applications.  BDP has surged 2,100% in the past week, CoinGecko data shows, while MDT has jumped 150%. Both protocols use their tokens to commoditize data, allowing providers and buyers to exchange data securely and anonymously.  Crypto majors such as bitcoin and ether have paled in comparison, rising just 30% each in the past month despite fundamental catalysts. However, the market capitalization of major tokens is upward of $300 billion, meaning they require significant amounts of investment and public interest for prices to surge multifold within a few weeks.  Why are AI tokens surging?  AI broadly refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and act like humans. Popular applications for this technology have so far been limited to chatbots, self-driving cars, optimizing search in online marketplaces and image-generation software – but futuristic usecases envision wholly autonomous cities, cyborg humankind and interstellar travel.  Much of the recent surge in AI tokens emerged after the public launch of chatbot ChatGPT and image generation software Dall-E in mid-2022. Both are traditional software that do not use cryptocurrencies or blockchain and were launched by OpenAI, which recently raised $10 billion from Microsoft at a $29 billion valuation.  Such institutional interest has helped create a compelling argument for crypto traders to bet on AI-focused tokens as the next growth sector.  ""The growth opportunity around the AI and Web3 space combines early interest, potential and hype,” states Ravindra Kumar, founder of crypto wallet Frontier. “While it's true that there may be some hype surrounding AI intervention in the crypto space, we are seeing the emergence of innovative and compelling use cases.’  Aditya Khanduri, head of marketing at Biconomy, takes a milder approach: “I believe that the current AI trend is still pretty speculative, leading to a jump for tokens like OCEAN, ALI, AGIX. Some of the tokens with more buzz and followings have pumped and it's less about the actual tech behind it.”  “This is because the current AI tokens and Web3 projects may not yet know what these decentralized AI tools look like. There's a lot of unanswered challenges and lots to be figured out,” Khanduri told CoinDesk in a recent chat.  The likes of Khanduri say token-based usage while scaling AI software is a hard problem to solve.  “Say an AI tool gets to 250 million users. Then what will its infra look like? How will people use it? How will the data be trained? Where does the token fit in? Can you even have a way to reward people for their data if you used it to train your models?” he said.  Meanwhile, some market watchers remain cautious about the AI token hype.  “Once the market starts livening up a bit, all sorts of new trends come out of the woodwork. And they are not all as solid as they might look,” financial market consultant Valentina Drofa told CoinDesk.  “There is a risk that this whole ‘new trend’ is going to end up in an empty hype, as there are many speculators that would seek to make use of short-term price pumps,” Drofa added, referring to the recent multifold gains put up by some tokens.  “The industry at large will end up dealing with the long-term fallout and another hit to its image. Such cycles are becoming rather tiresome and sad to observe again and again,” she stated.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/08/heres-why-artificial-intelligence-focused-cryptocurrencies-are-vastly-outperforming-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75e1d5a8a5152257dff02ed0bf2c7a3e6f5c47df-1024x1024.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393911,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc3kT,1675825200,Unpacking India's CBDC Pilots as Country Prepares for Digital Rupee,"India wants to launch its central bank digital currency at a national level by the end of 2023, but early into its pilot, the Reserve Bank of India has identified challenges, several people familiar with the matter said.  India launched two CBDC pilots last year. The first, a wholesale CBDC effort (CBDC-W), began on Nov. 1 with the participation of nine banks. The other, a retail CBDC (CBDC-R) pilot, launched on Dec. 1 in four cities – Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru and Bhubaneswar. Initially, four banks, including the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank and IDFC First Bank participated.  It has ""now been extended to 15 cities with Chandigarh as the newest addition,"" a senior official told CoinDesk. ""More than 50,000 customers and 10,000 small and big merchants have been onboarded now,"" including Reliance Retail, the nation's largest retail chain.  The CBDC-R is meant for the private sector and Indian citizens. The wholesale CBDCs are restricted to financial institutions and are meant to improve the efficiency of interbank payments. While the government told parliament India will issue a CBDC-R within the financial year 2022-23, it’s not completely clear when it will be implemented.  India’s charge towards CBDCs isn’t exactly unique. Internationally, 105 countries, representing over 95% of global GDP, are exploring a CBDC, according to the Atlantic Council’s Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker.  Some nations have collaborated to explore different use cases of CBDCs under the guidance of the Bank for international Settlements (BIS).  The central banks of Israel, Norway and Sweden have teamed up to explore how CBDCs can be used for international retail and remittance payments. China, Thailand, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates are attempting something similar in Project mBridge. Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Africa came together in Project Dunbar.  India has not entered into any CBDC project with any country so far but has indicated it will occur in the future. ""Collaboration with stakeholders including with BIS on developing common global standards for facilitating easy cross-border transactions, will be a way forward,"" a central bank document said.  India’s current key motivations appear to be divided between what has been publicly stated and its private geopolitical preparations.  Publicly, the RBI has said the CBDC will provide an additional option to the currently available forms of money that is easier, faster and cheaper to use than existing payment rails, along with the transactional benefits of other forms of digital money.  Privately, as an emerging economy, one of the world’s largest populations in 2023, and the fifth largest in terms of GDP, India’s geopolitical motivation is to counter the dollarization of the global economy.“  In the context of the internationalization of the Indian rupee, an Indian CBDC will make it easier for the nation to get international acceptance because it is digital,” said an official working on the CBDC efforts. “For emerging markets, it is a good weapon to have so that in future when we are looking for internationalization this can be one good help.”  The primary challenge for India’s CBDC project is marketing it to the nation’s populace. Indians are grappling with several questions around CBDCs, including distinguishing between wholesale and retail CBDCs, the digital rupee and eRupees, and whether a blockchain is even involved.  This ambiguity extends to a lack of understanding around India’s public policy goal for a CBDC. Even Nandan Nilekani, the prime architect of India’s biometrics-based unique identity program and the co-founder of tech firm Infosys, has sought clarity about it.  The broad objective of India’s CBDC has been to “modernize the current physical (cash) currency system,” according to a senior official working on the CBDC efforts. But what that actually means has not been detailed for the general public. India’s government has begun launching “awareness” campaigns warning citizens about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies at large, contrasting those with the still-developing CBDC projects.  The narrative  India’s government has turned to the country’s media platforms to explain what the CBDCs are, and what they may be used for.  In the past few weeks, India’s news networks, particularly government-run and business channels, have focused on explaining CBDCs and their potential role within India’s economy.  This is a shift from earlier this year when news organizations were more focused on advertising crypto exchanges and content focused on trading.  The shift may be because the Advertising Council of India released guidelines for crypto-related advertisements, requiring disclaimers calling crypto products “highly risky” and unregulated.India’s central bank is now “pushing for education around CBDCs,” an official working on the CBDC efforts told CoinDesk.  “Nobody expected RBI to launch the pilot so quickly,” said the official. “So, they [media and financial experts] are talking about it now because they are surprised.”  Why CBDCs  India already has a ubiquitous cashless movement: the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). UPI allows citizens to pay for groceries and other goods using a QR code linked to their bank account, which automatically transfers money from their bank accounts to a merchant's account.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das said a CBDC will remove the need for a bank intermediary, adding that “it’s important to clarify this point because a lot of people are asking what is different between UPI and CBDC.”  “UPI is bank money. This is central bank’s money,” said a person familiar with the RBI’s work on awareness around CBDCs. ”This will have all the features of physical currency without the risks. It's different from UPI because this is a currency system, not a payments system.”  Cash presents risks of tangible money to steal, more money laundering and counterfeiting.  RBI Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar said a CBDC could maintain cash-like anonymity, which is not available in UPI.  “What exactly will happen will depend on how things evolve,” Sankar said. “But anonymity is a basic feature of currency and we’ll have to do that. And to that extent, it is again different from UPI,” which is not anonymous because it carries a digital footprint.  The CBDC also doesn’t require any time for settlement between the banks of the buyer and seller, unlike UPI.  One of the central bank’s “key motivations for exploring the issuance of CBDC” is to “foster financial inclusion,” a central bank document said.  At the moment, using a CBDC requires a bank account. If the bank and city are currently involved in the pilot, your bank, in coordination with the RBI, can create a digital wallet for you and transfer cash to it. Then one can start using the CBDC to transact. The RBI will maintain a ledger of the transactions. The entire process will remove the settlement mechanism between banks, adding efficiency to the payment system, said an official working on the CBDC efforts.  Although this aspect still needs to be tested, a citizen won’t necessarily need a bank account to use the CBDC, the official said. Citizens who don’t have bank accounts cannot use UPI.  “The entity authorized by the RBI to open digital wallets for people in rural areas will do the necessary KYC (Know your customer) checks. One need not have a bank account to have a digital wallet. This will happen in the future depending on each pilot,” said the official.  While the CBDC could bank the unbanked, the problem is Indians prefer to keep their savings at home.  A 2017 World Bank report revealed that more than 80% of Indian adults have bank accounts, but a survey conducted by an entity under India’s Finance Ministry found that most respondents (52%) prefer to keep their savings at home.  The money you take out from your bank account to put in your CBDC wallet will not accrue interest like money in your bank account does, according to a person aware of the current thinking of the RBI.  One of the major advantages of the CBDC is that it will “drastically” reduce operational costs by reducing the annual recurring expense of physical currency.  At the moment, UPI is free to drive the government’s objective of a digital India and a cashless society. But the operational cost of UPI may exceed 8400 crores INR ($1 billion) annually, based on an estimate from WHO. The Payments Council of India estimates the annual loss to be around $664 million. The government has stated that this loss would be absorbed by savings from the nation using less cash.  India spends approximately $600 million to print cash alone and even more to manage it. And 14% of India’s $3.18 trillion GDP is cash in circulation. India is exploring whether it can lower this component.  It’s still to be seen whether the reduction in cost will be worth the advantages on offer.  The central bank will bear the cost of the CBDC infrastructure, said a person familiar with the matter. The financial considerations would involve the central bank taking responsibility for the digital vault of millions of Indians.  The CBDC has the potential to replace UPI, but the RBI does not “envisage a picture without UPI,” according to a senior official working on the CBDC efforts.  “As of now, it looks like they will complement each other. The CBDC will target the physical cash component. If the comfort increases and people refuse UPI, then so be it. Let the competition be there,” the senior official said.  It’s unclear whether the nation will provide any incentive for citizens to adopt CBDCs amid the UPI success and whether it will even come to that.  Technology  In parliament, Finance Minister Pankaj Chaudhary said the CBDC, currently in the trial phase, has components based on blockchain technology.  “It’s part DLT [distributed ledger technology] and part API [Application Programming Interface],” said the senior official. “We are testing various technologies. Maybe we will see other technologies that can cater to India’s population. It’s not a challenge, but we are trying to find the best possible technology.”  The API is not linked to any blockchain, which means India’s CBDC and its association with blockchain remain opaque.  “It’s a closed user group and we are trying with limited numbers to check the tech and every aspect, right from creation to usage, and this is working well. Gradually, it will be expanded to other cities and more users,” said the same senior official.  Use cases  One of the crypto industry's idealized use cases is as a currency, letting people buy and sell goods or services as they would with cash. But that had risks that came to the fore with the crypto contagion involving Terra, hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and the FTX exchange.  Now, the central bank espouses CBDCs as a mechanism that provides the public with uses that any private virtual currency can provide, but without the associated risks of the broader crypto industry.  The exact uses for the CBDCs are still to be determined.  One of the officials working on the CBDC efforts told CoinDesk that the retail CBDC could be programmed for specific uses. For example, any tokens distributed as part of a government subsidy project could only be spent on goods for that project.  “We are looking at various other use cases like offline payments and programmability. And based on the outcome of our experimentations, we will have the best CBDC with the best features,” said the official.  International race  The central bank and the government want India’s soon-to-be world’s largest population to adopt CBDCs for reasons beyond the possible technological advantages.  A CBDC has often been thought of as a geopolitical weapon that could give one nation an advantage over the other or even change the global financial order. China’s early exploration of the CBDC is a looming threat. An Oxford University law faculty paper has discussed this at length. Deutsche Bank has stated CBDCs could challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance. Former U.S. government officials and academics even conducted a “war game"" exercise examining the possible role a CBDC issued by China could play in geopolitical strife.  Nineteen of the G-20 countries, the 19 nations with the largest economies plus the European Union bloc, are exploring a CBDC, with 16 already in the development or pilot stage.  India took charge of the G-20 presidency on Dec. 1, 2022, and a series of meetings have already taken place with the Indian central bank's entourage extending to over 20 people, according to a government official involved in the proceedings. India is looking to coordinate global crypto rule-making, which involves several contours of the CBDC framework.  Cross-border payments  It’s also not clear how or by how much CBDCs will help in the cross-border payments space.  India began pushing for CBDC coordination during its G-20 presidency regarding international remittances, said people familiar with the matter.  CBDCs could eliminate the high costs, slow speed, limited access and insufficient transparency in international remittances for Indians, says the RBI.  India is the world’s largest recipient of remittances, receiving $100 billion in 2022, according to a World Bank report.  The RBI concept note called for central banks to incorporate cross-border considerations in their CBDC design from the start and coordinate internationally” to help “overcome key challenges relating to time zone, exchange rate differences, as well as legal and regulatory requirements across jurisdictions.”  India has stated in the note that “​​security has to be the prime design concern while designing CBDCs,” but simultaneously declared a timeline stating it will issue a CBDC within the financial year 2022-23.

While Powell suggested that the Fed was winning its fight to tame inflation, he was clear that the time was not yet right to declare victory, and that more rate hikes are a possibility if the job market doesn’t weaken.  “The reality is if we continue to get strong labor market reports or higher inflation reports, it might be the case that we have to raise rates more,” the Associated Press quotes Powell as saying in a talk at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. “There’s been an expectation that it’ll go away quickly and painlessly. I don’t think that’s at all guaranteed.”  Powell said that the Fed will need to “see whether we’ve done enough” after more rate increases.  Meanwhile, crypto markets were relieved after CoinDesk reported that Genesis and its parent Digital Currency Group (DCG) have reached an initial agreement with its main creditors, meaning a long, messy court battle is unlikely. DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  Speaking on CoinDesk TV, Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of digital asset investment adviser Lumida Wealth Management, said that after this deal DCG still has a “continued headache” but “doesn’t have a noose around its neck.”  “It’s going to continue to drain cash for them, but there’s a viable business on the other side of this,” he said.

Insights  Why the Venture Capital Industry Won't Miss Alameda Research  The empire of Sam Bankman Fried was the center of the crypto universe for most of 2020-2022, and an active participant in the crypto venture capital community. What sort of impact will its demise have on the industry? Will its presence be missed, or is the VC sector better off without the embattled firm?  It’s the latter, say analysts.  For a while, during the bull run, it seemed like Alameda was attached to most of the hot crypto deals getting closed. Data from PitchBook shows that the former fund closed 38 deals in 2022, which is impressive considering that there are only 52 weeks in the year.  But Alameda Research is no more – bankrupt, along with FTX, in an epic collapse that’s one for the history books.  Certainly, the market seemed to care a lot about this as it happened. The last two months of 2022 were a crypto winter as dark as any in history, with prices in free fall with seemingly no end in sight. Come January, and things are thawing out: Bitcoin is up around 40% in the first month of the year.  ""We believe there is plenty of dry powder among crypto-native and crypto-focused VC funds to more than compensate for the fundraising gap left by Alameda and FTX,” Robert Le, a senior emerging technology analyst at PitchBook, told CoinDesk in an email.  Le thinks that the other major funds that PitchBook counts on its top 10 list of investors active in the crypto space will pick up the slack, such as a16z, Dragonfly and Pantera Capital.  Perhaps a fair question is, does the VC world want another Alameda? Although the firm closed 38 deals it wasn’t the biggest investor. That goes to Coinbase Ventures, as PitchBook puts its deal count at 121. Despite this, Coinbase Ventures just doesn’t have the same profile Alameda had. Its management team, for example, is lesser known than Alameda’s high-profile executives.  “The void left by Alameda shouldn't necessarily be completely filled by the market. It is possible their investments supported projects, which otherwise would not have had any traction, that increased the noise in an ecosystem geared towards delivering the next phase of thoughtful innovation,” Cumberland venture capital co-lead Nate George said.  Peering through Alameda’s investments via CryptoRank, and one can see what George means. There are dozens of now highly illiquid, worthless tokens that had investors lining up because Alameda led the round and it had Bankman-Fried’s blessing.  If there’s one sliver of good news for creditors, it’s that Alameda’s collection of portfolio companies is up around 57% in the last month, per CryptoRank data, compared to a loss of 78% during the last year.  It’s not a huge deal to sell off token holdings, Mark Pfeiffer, an insolvency lawyer at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, explained to CoinDesk in an email. These ownership interests would just be another line item likely sold off during bankruptcy.  The exception to that would be FTT, FTX’s native token, which at one time accounted for a material portion worth billions on Alameda’s balance sheet. It’s up nearly 120% in the last month, and has become re-listed on major exchanges like Binance, KuCoin and Gate.io (at the height of the FTX crisis it was de-listed from most exchanges). FTT, now a security in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, isn’t something that can be sold as easily.  “It will be difficult, but not impossible, for the debtors to sell the tokens to monetize them,” Pfeiffer said.  CoinGecko data shows that while there’s been a surge in pricing for FTT and a major uptick in volume, the spread percentage is relatively high on most exchanges, and the depth shallow. It appears to just be a fun thing to punt around on-chain and not something of material value.  That’s OK, though. Alameda’s creditors have plenty of other altcoins they can sell.

The median participant is projecting a terminal federal funds rate between 5% and 5.25% and not anticipating any cuts late in the year. Market expectations remained more constructive with a peek in rates in June or July at the lower range of 4.75% to 5%. A healthy labor market, as seen in Friday's strong January jobs report, is a large driver of Chair Powell's key, non-housing services inflation metric. ""We got to be honest with ourselves. We'll see more persistent inflation in that sector which will take longer to get down."" - Chair Powell. There is a just ton of news driving sentiment in the digital asset space. On the regulation front Congressman Patrick McHenry, an active digital asset proponent, now has control of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Pro-crypto amici lawyers are making headlines against the SEC in the courts with the LBRY Credits ( LBC-USD ), Ripple/XRP ( XRP-USD ) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) litigations. And the contagion from the implosion last May of top algorithmic-style stablecoin LUNA (LUNA-USD) is currently still creating large waves with the Genesis bankruptcy filing and the pressure it puts on its parent, and sector behemoth, the Digital Currency Group. But despite all the news, Federal Reserve monetary policy should remain the main influencer of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) price in the medium-term. In the graphic below note the close correlation between the interest rate and liquidity sensitive Nasdaq Composite and the Bitcoin price. Since the beginning of Fed tightening early last year, there has been a strong inverse correlation between the technology and digital assets sectors and increases in interest rates and interest rate expectations. Also note from the graphic, there can be a sharp divergence from the correlation around large events like the FTX bankruptcy in November, but that the general linkage still dominates. Data by YCharts The markets liked Chair Powell's press conference last week and the Nasdaq closed up over 2% on Wednesday with Bitcoin immediately rallying another $700. On the surface there was some dovish pivot to the language in the statements as well as an open recognition that the inflation outlook had substantially improved. But this dovish narrative belies a growing problem; the Fed forecast implies meaningfully higher rates, and for longer, than market participants currently anticipate. Consider the following inquiry at the press conference from Simon Rabinovitch with The Economist that highlights the ""higher"" discrepancy: Rabinovitch - May I ask a further question about the language around ongoing increases that, of course, implies at least two further rate rises? If you look at fed fund and futures pricing, the implication is that you'll raise rates one more time and then pause. Are you concerned about that divergence or do you think if everything breaks right, is that a plausible outcome? Powell - I'm not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is largely due to the market's expectation that inflation will move down more quickly. Chair Powell’s Press Conference , federalreseve.gov, 2/1/23 During the Q&A Powell also recognized the ""for longer"" discrepancy and emphasized market expectations for cuts this year may be misplaced. Again, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SEP, and I mean, there are many different forecasts, but generally, it's a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly. And in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year. Of course, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster, that's a different thing. You know, if that happens inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we'll be seeing that and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy. Chair Powell’s Press Conference , federalreseve.gov, 2/1/23 (link above) We will get the next Summary of Economic Projections from the Fed with the March FOMC meeting materials. But, looking back to the December SEP's dot plot, the median participant is projecting a terminal federal funds rate between 5% and 5.25%. It is important to note that the dot plot also indicates the expectations for year end. So the participants are not anticipating cuts later in the year. SEP ""Dot Plot"" 12/22 (federalreserve.gov) Over the past year the Fed has continually adjusted its policy outlook to be increasingly tight as the ""inflation is transitory"" narrative proved incorrect. As of December the Fed continued to meaningfully raise their expectations for the terminal rate. Note the dotted lines in the graphic below represent the prior SEP from September of '22. It would be reasonable for the March data to show Fed expectations have again moved up. SEP ""Bar Chart"" Quarter Over Quarter 12/22 (federalreserve.gov) Despite Powell's case for meaningful additional tightening that is maintained into 2024, the Thursday following the FOMC meeting did not indicate much of a change in market expectations. Looking to the CME FedWatch Tool , market expectations remained more constructive with a peek in rates in June or July at the lower range of 4.75% to 5%. Note the January Employment Situation from the BLS that was reported Friday did cause a rise in rate expectations. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 517,000 during the month, a large beat of the forecast that had called for less than a 200,000 rise. However, it is likely the Fed outlook will also equally incorporate this unexpected strength, and the prior divergence between the Fed and markets remains. Why The Divergence? A Key Inflation Metric Is Labor Market Dependent Put simply, investors expect the return of the entrenched dovish monetary policy that has characterized the post-2008 Fed. From 2009-2021 the effective federal funds rate remained below 2.5% and quantitative easing has taken the Federal Reserve's balance sheet from $1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, with no periods of substantial normalization beyond the relatively small 2018 decrease of about 15%. Both business leaders and the business media have raised concerns that Fed policy may now be overly restrictive. And there is a growing belief that the Fed should and will pivot. Recall from November when Elon Musk tweeted that Fed policy amplifies the probability of a ""severe recession"". A similar example from the recent press conference comes in a question by Steve Liesman of CNBC. ...the three-month annualized PCE is 2.1 percent. And you've achieved this without going to your 5.1 percent funds rate, which is what you have penciled in for this year. And you've also achieved it without the one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year. I'm wondering if you've considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong.... Chair Powell’s Press Conference , federalreseve.gov, 2/1/23 (link above) Powell himself recognizes the recent reversal in the headline PCE trend. But thinks there is more risk in doing too little rather than going too far. The inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases.... I continue to think that it's very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually were close but didn't get the job done, inflation springs back and we have to go back in. And now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. Chair Powell’s Press Conference , federalreseve.gov, 2/1/23 (link above) Keeping expectations well anchored is a principle for Powell and the Fed. And participants are looking closely within inflation data to insure price increases don't become entrenched in any of the large components. Relating back to Liesman's question about apparent strong progress toward lowering inflation with no damage to the labor market, Powell explained his fears. ...we have a sector that represents 56 percent of the core inflation index where we don't see [dis]inflation yet. So, we don't see it. It's not happening yet. The inflation in the core services [ex]housing is still running at 4 percent on a 6- and 12-month basis. In the other two sectors [goods, housing services] representing, you know, less than 50 percent, you actually, I think, now have a story that is credible, that's coming together, although you don't actually see [dis]inflation yet in housing services, but it's in the pipeline, right? So, for the third sector, we don't see anything here. So, I think it would be premature, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that we've really got this. ...the core non-housing services as I mentioned earlier, it's a very diverse sector... we think [majority] are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the labor market in a way, but some of the other sectors are not. ...research would show [core non-housing services] is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be important. we're just telling you that we don't see inflation moving down yet in that large sector. ...we got to be honest with ourselves. ...we'll see more persistent inflation in that sector which will take longer to get down. Chair Powell’s Press Conference , federalreseve.gov, 2/1/23 (link above) [author edited transcript] The coming months are likely characterized by this resolutely hawkish and careful FOMC that is highly accepting of a weaker labor front. This scenario will be a headwind for interest rate and liquidity sensitive assets like Bitcoin. Consider Trading Around Core Bitcoin Holdings Going forward toward the 2024 halving, I expect periods of lower average volatility, a possible retest of the $16k bottom and eventually significant gains, though not the parabolic price appreciation seen during the bull runs. My wide target range for the price through the March '24 halving event is between $35k and $45k. This is based on prior cycles' price action during the corresponding period in the cycle and average mining costs, including an expected 40% increase in total network hash rate over the timespan. Each investor's particular investing style, risk profile and time horizon differ. But current technical analysis points to a majority probability of a short-term correction. Digital assets may also struggle short-term as market expectations shift in the coming months to align with the Fed's more hawkish plans to ensure inflation will return to the mandated levels. This is especially likely if we continue to see a healthy labor market, as in Friday's strong January jobs report, which recall from above is a large driver of Powell's key, non-housing services inflation metric. Put differently, caution is warranted following the recent run, and a buy the dip opportunity may present in the next few months. One temporary option for those looking to stay invested, avoid timing and basically maintain their HODL stance in the sector is to change allocation plans for any new funds, as well as redirecting recent gains from higher beta and leveraged exposures. Consider shifting from the Bitcoin miners, Coinbase ( COIN ), MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) to more direct exposures like the futures-based ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The Grayscale product is particularly interesting because its current, meaningful discount to NAV may reverse from pending litigation upside or a future redemptions plan. The Grayscale Trust has the added advantage over the ProShares product in that it is holding Bitcoin on-chain rather than through cash-settled derivatives. My new marketplace service is coming soon. Complete Crypto Analytics is launching in the near future and will provide model allocations for Bitcoin and Bitcoin adjacent names such as GBTC and the miners.
