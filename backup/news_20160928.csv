42427086,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7Ph,1475090797,US Central Bank Chair: Blockchain Could Have 'Significant' Impact,"During an appearance before a House of Representatives committee hearing today, Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen remarked that the US central bank is “trying to understand” financial technologies like cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  Yellen was speaking before the Committee on Financial Services, during which she was asked by Rep. Mick Mulvaney about the Fed’s position on cryptocurrencies and whether it investigating internal applications of blockchain.  While Yellen said that the Fed wasn’t doing so, she did indicate that the US central bank was pursuing lines of inquiry within the broader context of fintech. However, she did remark that blockchain tech could have a major impact on payments and banking in the future.  She told committee members:  “It could have very significant implications for the payments system and the conduct of business. We want to foster innovation. I think innovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society.”  Yellen went on to say that “we’re simply trying to understand the nature” of fintech, adding that the Fed wasn’t currently pursuing any kind of rule-making process at this time. The comments come more than two years after Yellen first indicated that the Fed wouldn't move to regulate bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The remarks come amid growing momentum around blockchain in Washington, DC. This week saw the formation of a congressional caucus dedicated to the technology, as well as the establishment of an information hub co-founded by the Chamber of Digital Commerce and DC-based incubator 1776.  A recording of Yellen’s testimony can be found below – comments begin at the 2:29:18 mark.

42427084,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7Hh,1475088316,IBM: Banks Expect Commercial Blockchains By 2017,"Banks and financial firms are planning to release commercial-grade blockchain services within the next two years, two surveys published today by IBM show.  In total, 200 banks and financial markets operators, respectively, were surveyed about the current status of their work with the technology, and 15% of banks interviewed indicated that they see commercial-scale services coming online sometime before the end of 2017.  Of the financial markets operators asked the same question, 14% suggested that they would have their own services online by that date.  ""In effect, 2017 looks to be the year banking on blockchains shifts from zero to sixty,"" the company said of the results.  The bulk of those surveyed see commercial-grade products hitting the market sometime by 2020. In the case of banks, 51% percent anticipate releases within that time period, with 34% anticipating that they would do so after 2020.  That data was mirrored among financial markets stakeholders, the surveys show.  Fifty-six percent said they expect to have services online by 2020, with the remaining 30% suggesting that they might release something after that time.

42427093,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7hh,1475086060,"In Formal Verification Push, Ethereum Seeks Smart Contract Certainty","There's a new blockchain buzzword arriving in time for fall – formal verification.  The phrase (used to describe the application of mathematics to verify software programs) has so far been evoked sparsely in the press. But if conversation at ethereum's developer summit last week was any indication, it could play an increasing role given the security questions that still surround smart contracts and blockchains more broadly.  As evidenced by multiple talks dedicated to the subject at Devcon2, the idea that new assurances could be given to ethereum coders is being widely embraced by its development community. Already, the concept is being proposed as a way to inspire confidence in everything from the ethereum protocol itself to its experimental proof-of-stake blockchain.  That this has come to pass is perhaps no surprise given the sudden collapse of The DAO this summer, to date the largest smart contract yet launched on the decentralized application development platform.  But while formal verification may sound complex, the concept can perhaps be summed up succinctly as applied to ethereum – coders currently use a largely new language (solidity) to write smart contracts, writing commands that are then translated into bytecode for use by the ethereum virtual machine (EVM) and disseminated to the network's nodes for execution.  In a sense, formal verification can be seen as a more objective way to ensure that when different component parts of the network receive these instructions, they execute them as intended on behalf of users.  Grant Passmore, co-founder of Aesthetic Integration, is one entrepreneur who sees an opportunity in helping assist in this effort, using Devcon2 to launch Imandra Contracts, a formal verification platform for blockchain smart contracts.  At the event, he evoked the idea that ethereum could serve as a ""paradise"" for formal verification (a widely cited touchpoint in talks) given the aims of its community and the significant responsibilities it wishes to entrust to code.  Passmore told CoinDesk:  ""The ethereum community is in a unique position, where after The DAO, we understand that rigorous engineering is necessary. You can't approach writing a smart contract like a web app.""  Elsewhere, speakers like Cornell's Philip Daian spoke to the interest in the methodology more broadly, telling the audience he believes formal verification could help ethereum solve key issues.  ""It's going to be one critical piece of the overall picture. I'm looking forward to using ethereum to set the standard and show people how it's done,"" he said.  Training wheels  Given the recent emphasis financial firms have placed on exploring smart contracting languages, it was perhaps the concept of applying formal verification to Solidity that was the most frequent topic of discussion.  Developed for the ethereum platform, Solidity has faced criticism for being largely untested and difficult to write, largely because it is so new. Such issues have arguably been amplified due to issues with the language’s compiler, a lack of public libraries and the collapse of The DAO, which was vetted by notable members of its development community.  In this light, Christian Reitweissner, the creator of Solidity, acknowledged that there is a drive to implement formal verification so that errors can more effectively be detected by ethereum coders.  Reitweissner told CoinDesk that smart contract developers could one day use formal verification tools to, for example, determine if there are unforeseen errors in their work. He indicated that such a tool could be used to determine if, in adding two balances, the result extended longer than the field allotted by the compiler.  ""This could happen and the formal verification tool [would] automatically detect that. You can detect it early on and react on that inside the smart contract,"" he explained.  Reitweissner said that the Solidity team has already been exploring how to apply formal verification to its work. As early as last October, there were prototypes for how a toolkit called Why3 could be used for this purpose, though such offerings are not yet available for the full language.  Proving ground  That ethereum could be used to test how formal verification might be applied to finance more broadly was also a heavily discussed topic during the conference.  Passmore, for instance, said Aesthetic Integration has been working on applying formal verification in work with financial institutions since 2014, and that so far, clients have sought to use it in limited areas, like dark pools, where traders require certainty about fairness.  In smart contracts, Passmore suggested he sees ethereum as a community that could drive acceptance further.  ""Many of our banking clients, as we started working with them, we heard they were interested in the space, but that they were worried about the correctness of smart contracts,"" he said.  The advancement of formal verification has also attracted Yoichi Hirai for similar reasons. A formal verification engineer now employed by the Ethereum Foundation, his interest in the concept began as a researcher and in his prior employment at cyber security leader FireEye.  In a talk at the conference, Hirai spoke about his frustration applying formal verification in settings where he did not have access to the source code, or the tasks were perhaps too broad to advance the concept.  ""I found ethereum, I saw the EVM, the yellow paper, the specification, it was only 32 pages and I thought I can actually translate it and write proofs about smart contracts,"" he said.  Ethereum, by contrast, offers what he called a ""smaller specification"" and a ""solvable problem"" for engineers in determining how best to translate Solidity into bytecode.  ""I believe many more formal verification researchers are coming,"" he said.  No silver bullet  Yet despite the enthusiasm, there are steps being taken to caution how much formal verification could achieve. Developer Alex Beregszaszi, who is working on upgrades to the EVM, spoke to the need for a suite of solutions to help developers ensure smart contract code is working as intended.  Passmore, too, noted that it’s difficult to say whether his new system could have caught issues with The DAO as formal verification tools still require human input.  ""You can encode issues that happened with The DAO and check to make sure that you don't have those, but you have to know what to look for,"" he explained.  The limitations were acknowledged by Reitweissner and Passmore, both of whom cautioned developers not to think of formal verification as a “silver bullet”.  Reitweissner, however, sees the methodology as one that will advance as it is more widely used, with developers becoming slowly better at identifying issues and developing repositories where knowledge of common problems can be made accessible  In this way, Passmore believes the ethereum community is succeeding in ""evangelizing"" for the concept, something he believes will ultimately advance blockchain research.  Passmore concluded:  ""Even though this is something that many have never been exposed to, formal verification is what we need. It's a learning curve, but it must be embraced, and that's exciting.""

42427089,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7bh,1475068850,Momentum Grows for Blockchain Action in Washington,"It's been a big week for blockchain on Capitol Hill.  While only Wednesday, the week has already seen the launch of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus (an effort led by Rep Jared Polis and Rep Mick Mulvaney), and the opening of the DC Blockchain Center, an information hub for policymakers.  The two initiatives reflect the growing interest around the technology in the US capitol.  Though interest has existed for some time – Polis himself began accepting bitcoin donations in 2014 – recent developments suggest the groundwork is being laid for more activity in the year ahead.  Polis said of the new legislative effort:  ""It's vital for Americans, businesses and members of Congress to learn about blockchain technology so the US can continue to secure its stance as the global leader of ingenuity.""  2016 has thus far seen a number of events within the DC area aimed at educating policymakers and legislators, and there's even been action within Congress itself, in the form of a non-binding resolution calling for national support for blockchain tech.  Perhaps more notable is that Arizona Congressman David Schweikert has called for the technology to be used to alleviate long-standing issues in the administration of veterans health care.  Building awareness  While legislative proposals like the one submitted by Schweikert are certain to stir interest among some members of Congress, it's unlikely that they or others will gain much traction in the absence of more education and advocacy by industry stakeholders.  In some ways, the Coin Center and Chamber of Digital Commerce initiatives actually complement one another in this light.  Whereas the caucus will work on the floor of Congress itself to build interest among those who might one day vote on pieces of blockchain legislation, the DC Blockchain Center, co-founded by startup incubator 1776, can act as a setting for discussion for those both inside and outside of the legislative process.  ""[The Center is] uniquely positioned to connect the dots for government agencies and drive massive scale success through our connections, resources and mentoring programs,"" 1776 co-founder and CEO Evan Burnfield said of the launch.  Polis remarked earlier this week that the caucus is, in part, a vehicle for spreading that kind of in-depth awareness that would likely predate any significant legislative push.  He said in a statement:  ""It's vital for Americans, businesses, and members of Congress to learn about blockchain technology so the US can continue to secure its stance as the global leader of ingenuity.""

42427087,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7Vh,1475066439,ASX Sets Date for Decision on Blockchain Transition,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) says it intends to decide on whether it will migrate to a blockchain-based settlement system by the end of 2017.  The comments stem from a new address to shareholders from ASX chairman Rick Holliday-Smith today, in which he provided an update on its bid to evaluate whether the technology will eventually underlie its post-trade processes.  In statements, Holliday-Smith provided an update on the work, which it revealed had finished the prototyping stage in mid-August.  Holliday-Smith said:  ""We have successfully completed the distributed ledger prototyping stage and have moved on to building an industrial-strength solution that could be used to replace CHESS – our existing cash equities clearing, settlement and sub-registry system.""  A decision on whether to move forward with the blockchain system, Holliday-Smith said, could be made as soon as the second half of 2017.  Elsewhere, he voiced his belief that blockchain and distributed ledgers stand to significantly improve settlement processes. ASX first announced its intent to explore the technology in early 2016, at which time it unveiled that it would work with the New York-based startup Digital Asset Holdings (DAH) on the initiative.  As previously reported, ASX owns 8.5% of DAH, having invested upwards of $20m in the project to date.

42427098,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7nh,1475064084,CGI Launches Blockchain Lab for Trade Finance,"CGI has launched a lab dedicated to helping its trade finance and supply chain clients harness the efficiencies of blockchain for new and existing products.  The formal launch today at the Sibos finance conference in Geneva is part of the company's rapidly increasing use of Ripple's distributed ledger solutions. But, the lab itself will soon explore the benefits to trade finance more broadly.  As part of the digital sandbox offering, the company will let its clients experiment with how various blockchains interact with its new Digital Intelligent Gateway, which allows for the sending of a wide range of supply chain messages.  CGI's vice president of consulting and one of three project leads for the blockchain laboratory, Kittredge Carswell, said that goal of the laboratory is to build a library of blockchain APIs that all connect back to the legacy platform.  Carswell said:  ""Within that lab, our idea is to bring to proofs-of-concept, pilots developing at the solution level, the application layers and blockchain solutions, with the idea of accelerating those that seem worthy of doing so into commercial products.""  The Trade Innovation Lab is a three-tiered ""sandbox"" that begins with platforms that could include ethereum, BigchainDB, Ripple, Corda and Eris Industries, then works with CGI’s blockchain developers to build messaging workflows via the Intelligent Gateway that can be integrated via APIs to new blockchain applications.  Last year, CGI generated $10bn in revenue, and one of its largest services, according to Carswell, is hosting similar applications built with more traditional technology for its banking clients. The goal of the lab is to build new blockchain applications that streamline inter-company trade finance transactions between CGI's clients and other companies.  Of CGI’s existing clients, Carswell said many are already members of the R3CEV banking consortium and the Hyperledger business blockchain consortium.  Many of those clients and others who aren't currently members are already building blockchain proofs-of-concept and ""want this all to tie together,"" said Carswell.  The building blocks  The laboratory, which has been in development since earlier this year, is the culmination of a number of previous milestones along CGI's path to blockchain integration.  In February of these year, CGI helped coordinate Standard Charter’s integration with Ripple followed months later with its own integration of Ripple into one of its core products, the Intelligent Gateway used for Swift transactions.  Yesterday, CGI announced it is now managing its own Ripple validator node, the third company to do so following MIT and Microsoft.  Caswell said the company's blockchain work is motivated by concerns and interest in the potentially disruptive power of blockchain to the trade finance sector. Of CGI’s 65,000 employees, Carswell said 8,000 are in the trade finance.  He concluded:  ""We want to be riding that wave in as opposed to getting capsized by that wave.""

42427099,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7ph,1475062032,FX Firm Joins Mexican Bitcoin Exchange's $2.5 Million Fundraise,"Bitcoin exchange startup Bitso has raised $2.5m to make it easier for the underbanked in Mexico to gain access to financial services.  Among the investors is Mexico-based foreign exchange, Monex Group, which last year conducted $160bn in transactions in Europe, the US and Latin America.  Bitso's co-founder and president Daniel Vogel told CoinDesk he believes the expertise of Monex and the other investors will help the startup grow from its ""strong footprint"" of users in Mexico to elsewhere in Latin America.  Speaking from the exhibit booth his company won as part of a startup challenge hosted by Swift, Vogel said:  ""We are very interested in the rest of Latin America. There are some places where there's been a significant amount of bitcoin activity in Latin America, but there are other places that are very, very quiet. I think those places are very interesting.""  Other investors included Mexican VC firms Variv Capital and Xochi Ventures, and US investors Digital Currency Group (DCG), FundersClub, Bitcoin Capital and Blockchain Tech Limited. The investment was divided into two tranche's, the most recent of which closed last week.  DCG participated in an earlier, undisclosed seed investment.  Hiring spree  When the first tranche closed in May, the company employed six people, according to Vogel, a number which is about to grow to 15 following an upcoming new hire.  Vogel believes that the investment will go a long way toward meeting Bitso's hiring goal given that being based outside the US allows the company to hire more competitively.  Founded in 2014, the bitcoin exchange offers its customers an exchange to buy and sell bitcoin and ether with Mexican pesos, as well as a way to send remittances exchangeable in fiat currencies via a Ripple gateway it opened in 2014.  Currently customers use their account for everything from paying for online games to facilitating alternative peer-to-peer lending platforms. But based on user data, Vogel said relatively few of those users are making speculative investments.  ""We almost have no speculative players in our exchange,"" said Vogel. ""Most of what we see are people who are using this technology to achieve something.""  Reaching Mexico's unbanked  According to a report earlier this year by Mexico's National Institute of Statistics (INEGI), only about 44% of the nation's population has a bank account.  Though Vogel has identified the remaining 56% of the population as his immediate target market, there are more obstacles to this goal than just letting those people know his company exists.  Following a 2014 report suggesting that the Mexican government would restrict banks from using bitcoin, Mexico's Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) said bitcoin was subject to many of the same restrictions as cash and precious metals.  Over the past year, Vogel said he's met ""several times"" with Mexico's central bank, Banxico, the Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) and the Ministry of Finance (SHCP) with the aim of helping increase regulatory clarity in Mexico.  In June, Mexico released its financial inclusion strategy, or roadmap, which includes a provision to make it easier for startups to comply with KYC regulations and more, according to a World Bank report.  ""A big part of our roadmap as a company has been a sound regulatory strategy,"" said Vogel.  Reaching beyond Mexico  In spite of the increased KYC/AML requirements, Bitso currently counts 20,000 customers and processes on average about $2.5m worth of transactions a week, according to Vogel.  While the company isn't currently disclosing revenue numbers, it charges a percent fee per transaction based on monthly volume. This fluctuates between 1% for volume totaling less than 1 BTC per month and 0.1% for more than 320 BTC per month.  Currently, Bitso users in some countries, including the US are restricted from opening an account. But part of the new investment is geared toward solidifying its presence in Mexico.  As part of that effort, Bitso entered to be selected as one of payments messing platform Swift's Innotribe startups for the financial technology innovator.  After being selected in June, the winners were offered a $10,000 investment and perhaps more importantly, room and board at the Swift conference to exhibit their offerings to the 8,000 international financial sector professionals in attendance.  Vogel concluded:  ""We think this technology has all these really, really interesting properties and when we see people getting loans, connecting with global capital markets, making payments internationally.""  Correction: An original version of this article incorrectly stated that Founders Fund, not FundersClub, was part of Bitso's seed funding round.
