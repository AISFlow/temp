BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Attracts Net Inflows, How About Other ETFs? BlackRock forayed into the Bitcoin ETF space when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved IBIT in January 2024. Dubbed the world’s largest asset manager with a total asset-under-management (AUM) of $9 trillion, BlackRock’s entry into the nascent crypto ETF ecosystem was met with much enthusiasm by investors as it not only brought a degree of sophistication but also exhibited institutional approval toward the industry. Related Reading: BlackRock Calls Bitcoin ‘Hedge Against Global Disorder’, Analyst Sets $600,000 Target Yesterday, the asset manager’s regulated financial product pulled $15.8 million in daily net inflows, a first since August 26, 2024. The net inflow of funds into IBIT was strong enough to push the wider US spot Bitcoin ETF market into green territory, with a combined net inflow of $12.8 million. IBIT’s three weeks of no net daily inflows consisted of 11 days with zero flows, while two days – August 29, and September 9 – saw net daily outflows to $13.5 million and $9.1 million, respectively. Looking at the performance of other spot Bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale’s GBTC product witnessed a net daily outflow of $20.8 million. At the same time, Fidelity’s FBTC, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, and VanEck’s HODL experienced a net daily inflow of $5.1 million, $5 million, and $4.9 million, respectively. According to data from cryptocurrency ETF tracker SoSoValue, BlackRock’s IBIT reigns supreme among US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, with an enviable cumulative net inflow of $20.9 billion since the product’s inception early this year. FBTC follows this with $10.1 billion, Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB with $2.6 billion, and Bitwise’s BITB with $2.2 billion. In contrast, GBTC has witnessed a cumulative net outflow of $20 billion. Analysts blame the product’s exorbitant fee of 1.5% as a major reason for GBTC’s performance to date. For comparison, IBIT has a fee of 0.21%. Spot Ethereum ETFs Continue Their Lackluster Performance While spot Bitcoin ETFs ended the day with a combined net inflow of $12.8 million, spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a combined net outflow of $9.4 million. Akin to its Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF (ETHE) witnessed a net daily outflow of $13.8 million, followed by Bitwise’s ETHW with a $2.1 million net outflow. Only Grayscale’s mini Ethereum ETF (ETH) successfully attracted net inflows worth $2.3 million.

Central banks create base money, which is multiplied through fractional reserve banking, increasing broad money (M2), driving BTC prices higher. The US debt situation will likely lead to more base money creation, boosting M2 and BTC prices, potentially reaching $120,000 by February. Risks include insufficient lending stimulation from rate cuts and significant sell-walls at key price points like $100,000, impacting BTC's upward trajectory. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a proxy for global fiat liquidity. This is probably the most consistently true thing with regards to its price. One look at the chart below tells you almost everything you need to know about how well this relationship has held up for the last 14 years. Bitcoin and M2, yoy growth (BGeometrics) The chart above uses yoy growth. You can also toggle it to show growth over 7-week periods, which is over 7 times more granular. The relationship between global M2 liquidity and BTC price persists. Bitcoin and M2, 7 weeks growth (BGeometrics) It’s actually startling how well the red areas (negative M2 growth) correspond with mid-cycle drawdowns in BTC. The thesis here is quite simple: the most important factor for the growth of BTC is the increase in fiat liquidity. Global M2 means all the fiat currencies that have been multiplied, via fractional reserve banking, from a supply of base money. Here’s a quick overview of how it works. Fiat Overview The central bank — this can be the Fed (US dollar), ECB (euro), BoJ (yen), BoE (British pound), or the PBoC (Chinese yuan or renminbi) — issues base money in the form of banknotes and bank reserves. This is also called M0. Base money dollars are banknotes and bank reserves at the Fed, just as base money yen are banknotes and bank reserves at the BoJ. M0 is multiplied via fractional reserve banking. As consumers deposit base money (such as cash) in a bank, the bank can lend this out and create more money out of the base money. The created money is deposited in other bank accounts and then loaned out again to create even more money. The net aggregate of money creation from a set of base money is collectively called broad money. Though M2 isn’t strictly broad money, the two concepts are monotonically correlated. Note that technically two avenues of money creation exist here. The first is that the central bank can create base money out of nothing. This is as simple as entering a new entry for bank reserves (which is base money) for a particular bank (this is what happens when a bank is getting bailed out) or the US Treasury’s account (this is what happens when the Fed is the only buyer of US debt). The second avenue of money creation is the aforementioned fractional reserve banking which creates broad money or M2. M2 is what most people are dealing with on a day-to-day basis. Unless you get paid in physical cash, you are receiving broad money. When you buy a house or car with an asset backed loan, you are doing it with broad money because the bank is lending broad money into existence from a pile of base money that it holds (its bank reserves at the Fed). This mechanism is true all over the world with all major fiat currencies. So now we just have to look for whether global M2 is set to go through dramatic increases soon. In general, M2 increases can occur when more base money is created and the money multiplier of fractional reserve banking persists. Think of this as creating more M2 because more base money now exists to be multiplied. Now, M2 can also increase without base money increasing at all if there is more lending going on. What causes more lending? Lower interest rates! What is the Fed about to do? Lower the Fed Funds Rate! Both the BoE and ECB have already cut rates. While the BoJ is raising rates, this is largely to fight off the inflation that has been raging in Japan, which came as a consequence of excessive money creation from doing negative rates and yield curve controls. This Is Great For Bitcoin If the relationship between fiat liquidity and the price of BTC persists, then BTC has some incredibly strong tailwinds as we head into the first US rate cut in a few years. Fiat liquidity is about to surge to all-time highs, and the yoy M2 growth is headed for a much higher spike. This has always been accompanied with the BTC surging to new highs. Therefore, I do expect BTC to break through its ATH of around $73,000 and touch $120,000 by February. This would mean a 2x from today’s price. Previous surges in M2 growth rates have led to BTC increasing by a factor far larger than 2x. What is probably even better than rate cuts is the burgeoning US debt. At this rate, $1 trillion is added to the debt every 100 days . Unless something drastically changes, 100 days is going to eventually turn into 50 and then 30 days. This is just the nature of compound interest. The tax revenue for the US Federal Government was less than $4.5 trillion for fiscal year 2023. When 100 days adds $1 trillion, the US is very close to the point where a whole year’s tax revenue will not be enough for a whole year’s increase in the debt. The only way to make up the difference is to literally make the base money by creating bank reserves for the US Treasury account so that the Federal government can pay the interest on the debt. This obviously triggers the first way more M2 is created: when more M0 is created and then multiplied by the banking sector. After all, the interest payments go out into the real economy, into the hands of people who hold US government debt securities. All of this extra USD M2 of course increases global M2, which has, traditionally, flowed into BTC. With the debt situation reaching a point of exponential compounding, I think it is only a matter of time before BTC reaches the price targets I am putting out. Risks One important risk I could see playing out is that the rate cuts aren’t actually that stimulating in terms of lending activity. Many people have mortgages locked in between 3-4% from 2020 to 2021. These people will need rates to come all the way down before they will have any need to refinance at lower rates. This would mean less M2 growth, which undermines the thesis. Another risk is what can probably best be described as “sell walls.” A lot of people are wondering why the Halving-induced supply shock has yet to materialize. The only absolutely correct answer for this is the supply and demand dynamic. There are simply more sellers than buyers, and this is pushing the price down. The best representation of this would be whales selling into rallies. Even with corporations buying BTC as a treasury reserve asset and even with the buying pressure from the spot ETFs , there are still wallets with tremendous amounts of BTC that are able to keep the price lower because they are looking to exit their positions. Thus, many points along the path to $100,000 will likely be met with selling. I expect $100,000 to be a gigantic sell-wall because of the psychological significance of this number. Likewise, the previous ATH before $73,000 and the current ATH are all possible sell-walls. These things must be considered if you are trading BTC. Conclusion I think BTC remains one of the most compelling opportunities today, with very high upside over the next few months. It is not a flight to safety . It has flunked that test, at least in the near term. However, it is a supercharged proxy for M2 liquidity, and M2 liquidity is about to explode higher.

Many analysts and investors remain confident about a potential surge in the coming months, with some projecting significant price gains once XRP consolidates above current levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Monthly Downtrend: Can DOGE Reach $12? One top analyst and former asset manager, Amdtrades, shares this optimistic outlook, predicting a price increase above $1.26 shortly. Despite the confidence, uncertainty lingers across the broader market. The next few days will be crucial in determining the overall direction of XRP and the crypto market. Analysts believe that how XRP performs during this period could either fuel bullish sentiment or lead to further consolidation. Investors are closely watching these developments, as XRP’s movement could set the tone for market trends in the coming months. XRP Could Surge To $1.26 In Weeks XRP has recently demonstrated notable resilience compared to other altcoins. It has held firm above key liquidity areas and signaled a positive outlook for the months ahead. Many analysts and investors are beginning to notice the potential for a substantial price surge shortly. One prominent crypto analyst, Amdtrades, with nine years of experience as an asset manager and derivatives trader, recently shared his technical analysis on X, highlighting XRP’s strong positioning. In his analysis, Amdtrades showcased a weekly XRP chart that clearly outlines a defined uptrend. This uptrend has been consistently respected by the price, suggesting solid monthly support that could serve as the foundation for further upward momentum in this market cycle. Amdtrades views XRP as one of the safest investments for those seeking a 100% return on investment (ROI) in the crypto space. He has identified several key price targets for XRP, specifically around $1.18 and $1.26, which he anticipates will be reached in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Faces Serious Risk After Failing To Close Above Key Level – Details According to his analysis, if XRP continues to hold above current levels and successfully clears out local supply near $0.70, an aggressive surge toward these targets is highly likely. Such a breakout would not only validate XRP’s uptrend but also position the cryptocurrency for even higher price levels as bullish sentiment strengthens. As the market faces uncertainty, XRP remains a strong contender for those looking to capitalize on its strength and potential upside in the near term. Price Action Details XRP is currently trading at $0.587 after several days of volatility, following a 19% surge from local lows. The altcoin has struggled to break past this price level, but it remains above a critical support area. XRP is trading above the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.563, which has acted as a key indicator of short-term strength. This level was tested as support yesterday, confirming XRP’s recent stability despite volatile market conditions. For bulls to maintain momentum, XRP must break above the $0.60 mark, confirming a higher high and signaling a move toward higher supply levels. Breaking this resistance would suggest the continuation of a bullish trend and potentially lead to a stronger recovery for the altcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Long-Term Holders Locking Consistent Gains: A Sign Of Stability? On the other hand, if XRP fails to maintain support above the 4H 200 EMA, it could face a deeper correction. A breakdown would likely lead the price to test local demand around the $0.545 level, putting short-term bullish hopes in jeopardy. Maintaining support at current levels is essential for a sustainable rally.

Unclear regulations could stifle widespread adoption of the technology.  Moody's noted Helium {{HNT}} as an example that has shown promising developments within the sector.  The DePIN sector, which stands for decentralized physical infrastructure, could help existing networks scale and innovate, but several risks including unclear regulations could stifle growth, said the Wall Street credit ratings agency Moody's Ratings on Tuesday in its inaugural report about the sector.  ""By linking together established pieces of a system’s backbone with the building blocks of distributed ledger technology (DLT), DePIN has potential to improve network reliability and efficiency while lowering operational costs and optimizing resources and industry collaboration,"" the authors of the report said.  ""However, there are significant obstacles to widespread adoption, including regulatory and interoperability issues, cybersecurity risks and the need for substantial investments in infrastructure and skills,"" they said.  Incumbent network operators – telecommunication companies, utilities and transportation, to name a few – face ever-growing user demand that require capital-heavy infrastructure developments, the report said. Leveraging decentralized models could help them alleviate some of the pressure and stay relevant as artificial intelligence and internet-of-things (IoT) disrupt old business models, the report added.  Part of DePIN's allure is issuing their own digital tokens, which can help projects incentivize participation and network expansion. Today's unclear global regulatory landscape, however, makes compliance problematic and could stifle the sector's growth. Connecting existing infrastructure with blockchain rails could also open new attack vectors, creating cybersecurity risks.  DePIN combines blockchain technology with real-world networks such as telecommunications, file storage and computing capacity. The sector has become one of the hottest corners in the digital asset space this year. The fact that a well-known Wall Street traditional finance name like Moody's Ratings covers DePIN underscores the increased attention the sector is attracting.  ""The motivation behind writing on DePIN is to bring attention to a realistic need for industries to reassess infrastructure management strategies in a world increasingly driven by digital transformation,"" Rajeev Bamra, SVP and Head of Strategy of Digital Economy at Moody’s Ratings, told CoinDesk in an email.  The sector's increasing mindshare is reflected in rising venture capital funding, with investors allocating $583 million in private investments to DePIN projects this year so far, already surpassing the previous record year of 2022, according to a report by digital asset market maker Wintermute.  The Moody's report cited Helium {{HNT}}, a blockchain-based decentralized wireless network that gives users token incentives to deploy and maintain wireless internet hotspots, as an example that has shown promising developments. The project has attracted more than 350,000 participants and acquired more than 100,000 subscribers, the report noted.

33695847,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642532,1726603218,Analyst Identifies $0.75 As Most Crucial Target For XRP Price In The Campaign For $1,"The XRP price has experienced a notable surge in recent days amidst the wider backdrop of the crypto industry. At the time of writing, many cryptocurrencies are starting to reverse their seven-day gains due to Bitcoin’s failure to break above $60,000 on Monday. However, XRP continues to stand firm, registering a 2.23% gain in the past 24 hours. This positive price movement has sparked discussions within the crypto community about the potential for a significant breakthrough. Analyst Identifies $0.75 As A Crucial Target EGRAG CRYPTO’s highlight of the $0.75 price mark for XRP is based on an XRP/USD price chart on the weekly candlestick timeframe, which he shared on social media platform X. Interestingly, the latest highlight comes as an update to his XRP analysis from January 2024. This analysis focuses on XRP’s price structural formation, sentiment status, MACRO range, and psychological zone, all in critical price zones. The most notable are the MACRO range, which starts at $0.71, and the psychological zone at $0.932. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $0.1 Is A ‘Gift’, Falling Wedge Breaking Bullish To Send Price To $0.2 According to crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto, the key resistance level for XRP is $0.75, which could make or break its journey to $1. As EGRAG noted, all these levels can be shattered with just one strong daily candle, with emphasis on $0.75. For XRP, the $0.75 mark is within the MACRO range. Interestingly, XRP is yet to break above $0.75 this year, with its highest point so far being $0.718. Should the cryptocurrency manage to close above this level on a weekly timeframe, it could pave the way for a more substantial price rally. Will The XRP Price Sustain A Rally To $1? At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $0.5851 and is still on 8.4% gains in seven days. Based on the recent update, EGRAG noted that the move towards $1 is still in play, as XRP is poised for a massive breakout. Although EGRAG only noted the $0.75 price as the most crucial for a breakthrough, there exist other resistance levels that serve as forerunners. Looking at the XRP price chart, XRP has been trading below $0.62 since March. Interestingly, the cryptocurrency has retested this price level at least six times since then and has failed to break above. Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation In Full Swing As $1.3 Billion Exits Exchanges, $75,000 Next? From a technical perspective, $0.62 has emerged as a pivotal price point, acting as a short-term hurdle that XRP bulls must conquer before setting their sights on the more significant $0.75 resistance. A clear break above these levels would signal increasing buyer strength and potentially open the door for a campaign to $1. From a fundamental point of view, the XRP price is starting to campaign to the $1 mark in light of recent events in the XRP ecosystem. One such event is Grayscale’s recent unveiling of the first XRP trust in the US. This move has prompted speculation that an XRP ETF will hit the market soon. Another noteworthy development is the relisting of XRP on the European version of Robinhood.

42417229,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXHzB,1726601409,"SEC Charges 3 Individuals, 5 Companies With Operating Pig Butchering Scams","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed suit against three individuals and five companies for allegedly operating pig butchering scams – a type of confidence-enabled investment scam in which fraudsters befriend victims over text-based social media apps, gain their trust and convince them to invest large amounts of money in fictitious crypto platforms before stealing their funds and disappearing.  The two lawsuits filed Tuesday are the SEC’s first enforcement actions alleging this type of crypto scam, and come one day before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee is set to hold a hearing on pig butchering scams.  “Relationship investment scams, including those involving crypto asset investments, pose a risk of catastrophic harm to retail investors, and the threat is increasing rapidly as these scams become more popular with fraudsters,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement in a press statement. “In these two cases, we allege that fraudsters created fake crypto ecosystems that displayed false information to investors. Our allegations serve as a reminder to the public to be on heightened alert about potential scams involving investment opportunities promoted by strangers on social media.”  The SEC’s lawsuit against purported crypto trading platform NanoBit alleges that participants in the scheme – including three U.S. residents named in the suit, 28-year-old Jiajie Liu of Los Angeles, California, 29-year-old Fei Liao of San Gabriel, California, and 26-year-old Hua Zhao of Flushing, New York – engaged in a coordinated scheme to defraud at least 18 investors of nearly $1 million in crypto assets and fiat currency.  Liao, Zhao, and Liu allegedly pretended to be finance industry professionals in WhatsApp groups and enticed would-be investors to put their money into NanoBit’s platform. Though the platform seemed to show investors their assets were making money, when they tried to withdraw they couldn’t – and the fraudsters disappeared.  The SEC’s other lawsuit filed Tuesday, against another fake crypto trading platform referred to as CoinW6, alleges that unnamed participants in the scheme defrauded at least 11 investors out of $2.2 million between July 2022 and December 2023.  Instead of pretending to be finance professionals, however, scheme participants in the CoinW6 scheme allegedly took the guise of “young, attractive professionals” pretending to stumble across a victim’s social media profile before attempting to strike up a romantic relationship with them.  As is the case in many pig butchering operations, the CoinW6 fraudsters allegedly spent weeks developing romantic relationships over text before mentioning cryptocurrency. After getting their claws firmly into the victims, who at this point believed their romantic connections to be genuine, the fraudsters would introduce the idea of investing into CoinW6.  According to the complaint, the online interface would show victims that their investments were making significant returns, and the scammers would pressure them into putting more and more money into the platform – sometimes “even recommending that investors withdraw funds from retirement accounts or borrow money from friends and family to generate larger returns on CoinW6” – often by pretending to withdraw romantically.

33694447,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642631,1726599644,"Your October Top Picks Ethereum, Starknet and Mpeppe","As we enter the final quarter of 2024, the cryptocurrency market is shifting gears, presenting both challenges and opportunities. After a rough August and a bearish start to September, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are struggling to find stable ground. While BTC has dipped below key support levels, other altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Starknet (STRK), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are catching the attention of savvy investors as top picks for October. Starknet and Ethereum: Layer 2 Scaling Solutions on the Rise Ethereum (ETH) has long been the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 applications, but its scaling challenges have prompted the rise of Layer 2 solutions, such as Starknet (STRK). Starknet has gained traction as a scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH), improving transaction speeds and lowering fees through zero-knowledge rollups (zk-rollups), making it one of the most promising projects in the Layer 2 space. In recent weeks, Starknet (STRK) has been one of the best performers in the market. Despite the overall market downturn, Starknet (STRK) rallied with a 15.5% increase in the past week. This surge was primarily driven by the release of over 1.26 million STRK tokens by Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin, signaling strong confidence in the project’s future. Additionally, the upcoming staking mechanism for STRK, set to launch after a community vote in October 2024, has fueled investor enthusiasm. Ethereum (ETH) continues to be the dominant force in the blockchain space, but with scaling issues persisting, Layer 2 solutions like Starknet (STRK) are providing much-needed relief. Investors see Starknet (STRK) as a long-term play, and the token’s recent performance is a testament to its growing importance in the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem. The Rise of Mpeppe in the GambleFi Sector While Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) are focused on scaling and infrastructure, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captured attention in a completely different sector—GambleFi. As the online gambling industry continues to grow, the demand for decentralized platforms offering transparency, security, and fairness has skyrocketed. This is where Mpeppe (MPEPE) shines. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a token designed specifically for decentralized gambling platforms. It provides users with the ability to engage in gambling activities with the added benefits of blockchain technology, such as reduced fees, faster transactions, and provably fair gaming. The token is currently priced at $0.0021, making it an attractive entry point for investors looking for a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. Unlike traditional gambling platforms, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers unique incentives for token holders. By holding and staking Mpeppe (MPEPE), users can earn rewards and participate in governance decisions, making it an integral part of the platform’s ecosystem. As GambleFi continues to grow, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned to capture a significant share of the market, especially with the rising trend of decentralized casinos. Why These Three Tokens Are Top Picks for October So, why are Ethereum (ETH), Starknet (STRK), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) the top picks for October 2024? Each token represents a different segment of the market, offering unique value propositions: Ethereum (ETH): As the foundation of DeFi and Web3, Ethereum (ETH) remains a long-term investment with significant growth potential. While its scalability issues are well-documented, the continued development of Layer 2 solutions like Starknet (STRK) ensures that Ethereum remains relevant and competitive. Starknet (STRK): Starknet’s role as a scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH) cannot be overstated. With its zk-rollup technology and upcoming staking mechanism, Starknet (STRK) is becoming a critical piece of Ethereum (ETH)’s future.

Mpeppe (MPEPE): For those looking to diversify into emerging sectors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers exposure to the fast-growing GambleFi industry. Its low price and strong use case within decentralized gambling platforms make it a potential high-reward investment, especially as more users adopt decentralized gambling solutions. Conclusion In conclusion, while the broader market faces challenges, Ethereum (ETH), Starknet (STRK), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer promising opportunities for investors in October. Each token has a unique value proposition, whether it’s scaling Ethereum (ETH), improving transaction efficiency, or revolutionizing the gambling industry. For those looking to navigate the current market volatility, these three tokens are worth watching.

42417230,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXHy9,1726599264,"Forget Meme Coins, Crypto Utility Is Already Here","Memecoins have always been a feature of crypto, but only recently has the sector grown to become a dominant theme in the ecosystem. Memecoin launchpad “Pump.fun” reached over $100 million in revenue after just 217 days of going live, a record for the crypto industry. Since Pump.fun hit that milestone, the sector has cooled off. As the dust settles, lively debate has broken out as crypto natives lament what memecoins do to the industry’s image.  University College Dublin lecturer Paul Dylan-Ennis told The Block: “It's all the worst elements of our industry condensed into one epilepsy-inducing website.”  More than 99% of the memecoins launched on Pump.fun are dead within the first week. Nonetheless, users have launched around 2 million coins. Memecoins listed on CoinGecko boast a collective market cap of $40 billion. This is six times larger than tokens (not tokenized assets) categorized in the Real World Asset (RWA) sector at $6.6 billion, which involves the tokenization of everything from U.S. Treasuries to insurance.  Ignore The Nonsense, Crypto Utility Is Right In Front of You  Many crypto natives find these figures disheartening, leading to a palpable growth in the cohort of so-called “crypto nihilists” within the industry – people who think we are doing nothing here but slinging memes. However, while the crazy corners of crypto rage on, the serious part of the industry makes great strides.  Stablecoin market cap recently hit $175 billion, as demand for crypto’s greatest product grows. The utility and significance of USD-pegged stablecoins is often lost on crypto natives in Western countries. However, stablecoins have proven to be crucial products for people in emerging markets, whether they are avoiding hyperinflation of their native currency, or avoiding predatory remittance fees.  Meanwhile, infrastructure for crypto payments continues to develop. Mastercard recently partnered with Mercuryo, enabling users to spend their self-custodied crypto at more than 100 million merchants.PayPal and Venmo just integrated Ethereum Naming Service, enabling their users to transfer crypto by using readable names instead of traditional wallet addresses.  The Helium Network, a decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) project going after big telcos, has seen 113,000 people sign up to itsmobile service. That is 113,000 people who have ditched the likes of Verizon for a crypto alternative.  Crypto is also integrating itself into our lives through messaging apps. Telegram, with nearly 1 billion monthly active users, integrated The Open Network (TON), allowing users to transfer crypto as easily as sending a text. LINE, an Asian messaging app with over 230 million monthly active users, is following a similar plan with Kaia.  Both TON and Kaia are focused on building out mini apps that will enable crypto usage within Telegram and LINE. TADA, a major ride-hailing app in Southeast-Asian, just launched “TADA Mini” which enables users to book rides through Telegram and pay using TON or USDT. Kaia Wave, an incentive program starting in Q4, is offering up to $1.2 million in support for developers building out mini apps on LINE.  If that were not enough, there is every indication that the $12 billion in tokenized assets on-chain is only the beginning for the RWA sector. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, a tokenized investment fund focused on U.S. Treasuries and repo agreements, reached over $500 million in capital deployed this summer. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink frequently reiterates the vision to “tokenize all assets”, with BUIDL’s launch in March being just the start.  Memecoins Rarely Capture Headlines  Memecoins have stirred a lively debate within crypto circles, but “Dogwifhat” does not capture wider attention and make crypto look bad to outsiders. FTX defrauding customers and collapsing makes crypto look bad. $6 billion in DeFi exploits and hacks makes crypto look bad. VC-backed projects extracting millions and then exiting makes crypto look bad. Memecoins can make crypto look silly, but there are greater issues that damage the crypto’s image.  Fortunately, such issues are balanced out by positive fundamental developments in the space. It is easy to fall into the trap of crypto nihilism, particularly when the silliest sectors of the industry steal our attention away from real progress. Memecoin madness likely continues to be a feature of crypto, but it will be drowned as the industry ushers in a new era of real world crypto utility.

42417218,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXHqv,1726599009,"Brian Armstrong, ETF Experts Shoot Down 'Paper Bitcoin' Rumors","Rumors concerning Coinbase and BlackRock were scuttled by industry experts this week.  Crypto analyst Tyler Durden had accused the exchange of allowing BlackRock to borrow bitcoin without providing collateral, which would allow for market manipulation.  Rumors alleging Coinbase (COIN) was issuing bitcoin IOUs to BlackRock were quickly shut down by industry experts as well as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on Monday.  Over the weekend, well-followed X crypto analyst ""Tyler Durden"" accused Coinbase of allowing BlackRock – the issuer behind the largest spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund – to borrow bitcoin without providing collateral, which would allow manipulation of the market and profit from the resulting price swings.  Durden’s allegations came following a post from Tron founder Justin Sun on X, who described Coinbase’s new wrapped bitcoin product (cbBTC) as “trust me” given it lacked Proof of Reserves or audits and could freeze balances at any time.  “Any U.S. government subpoena could seize all your BTC,"" Sun wrote. ""There's no better representation of central bank Bitcoin than this. It's a dark day for BTC.""  In response to both allegations, Coinbase's Armstrong explained that the ETFs are minted and burned and settled on chain within one business day and that institutional clients have the option to use trade financing and over-the-counter options before the trades are fully settled.  Durden later deleted his tweet.  “I don’t believe these rumors and conspiracy theories for one second,” James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg, told CoinDesk. “It’s another in the long line of bad takes on ETFs.”  Seyffart reiterated the need for more issuers, including BlackRock, to share digital wallet addresses with the public to increase transparency. Crypto-native spot bitcoin ETF issuer Bitwise has done so for both its bitcoin and spot ethereum funds and was applauded for it by industry experts.  Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas criticized the bitcoin community for blaming the ETFs for the recent selling pressure in the market, “instead of looking in the mirror.”  “[People] who invest in BTC are generally skeptical of [the government] and institutions (which I get),” he wrote in a post on X. However, he said that BlackRock “isn’t playing around” and that the asset manager would “flip out” if Coinbase was “screwing around with their bitcoin.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/17/brian-armstrong-etf-experts-shoot-down-paper-bitcoin-rumors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f8e845d301c236d4f4687a125d984bf99f2fe55-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42417227,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXI0D,1726598988,Key Opinion Leaders Are Bad for the Crypto Industry,"This week, as Token2049 kicked off in Singapore, a crypto YouTuber going by “Professor Crypto” proudly announced he had received the Best Content Creator award at something called the “KOL Awards.” KOL stands for “Key Opinion Leader,” a term used in marketing for hiring influencers in a particular niche market, and that’s been a controversial (and overused) strategy for growing crypto.  But Professor Crypto’s announcement seemed odd: almost no crypto professionals or major players had ever heard of him, and he seemed to have a very limited track record. Within a day, thanks to sleuths including the legendary ZachXBT, it became clear that “Professor Crypto” had engaged in massive astroturfing, including thousands of purchased followers and bot-generated engagement on social media. Just a day after announcing a supposedly major award, Professor Crypto had deleted posts, blocked detractors, and seems to be in a bit of an image crisis spiral.  While not all “Key Opinion Leaders” are as outright fraudulent as Professor Crypto appears to have been, his sham exemplifies their risk. The KOL business model, based on paid and frequently undisclosed endorsements, motivates them to create engagement at any cost. Honesty seems like a much lower priority – and it’s the entire crypto industry that’s paying the price.  Why it’s time to K.O. the KOLs  Sometimes that price is quite literal. In early July this year, the Polkadot network releaseda treasury report revealing that it had spent more than $87 million dollars in the first half of the year. That’s a lot of money, but what really got people worked up was that almost half of it, $37 million, went to “Outreach” efforts including advertising, sponsorships, events – and “influencers.”  Influencers in crypto are exactly what you think they’d be in other industries – YouTubers, TikTokers and the like who have managed to attract big followings, and who take direct payments for coverage (or more accurately, promotion) of projects or tokens. Most infamously, the YouTuber BitBoy (born Ben Armstrong) was caughttaking payouts to pump tokens, without disclosing those relationships.  KOLs represent a breakdown of coordination: between influencers and their audiences, and more importantly, between influencers and the entire industry  In part because of the legacy of figures like BitBoy, influencers in crypto have recently pushed to rebrand themselves as “Key Opinion Leaders.” That sounds a lot classier – but it’s the same old wine in new bottles. Despite the rebrand, the way they work hasn’t changed much: Key Opinion Leaders are also paid to say positive things, rather than to seek out the truth.  That’s why the pile of Polkadot money going to influencers upset people. It gives the impression that the crypto industry is more about appearance and salesmanship than substance (and in fact, Polkadot’s development budget went down during the same period).  What is a key opinion leader, really?  Key Opinion Leaders and similar figures can have a negative impact because their business model, which awkwardly straddles journalism and public relations, creates deep conflicts of interest. They are not, in short, primarily motivated to do what is best for their audience.  Journalists broadly depend on readers for revenue, so their business goal is to produce high-quality, trustworthy information. To support that goal, news organizations are generally very careful to insulate reporters from financial details, like who’s buying ads. That information could influence their coverage to be more positive, or more negative, than the facts support.  At the other end of the spectrum are PR spokespeople or copywriters who are openly affiliated with a project and speak on its behalf. They get paid directly by projects – and that’s fine, because the relationship is clear and open. They’re representing a company or project’s perspective, so you know they’re going to put the best possible spin on statements, and should be regarded with fair skepticism.  The problem with Key Opinion Leaders is that they’re paid spokespeople who look like journalists. They have their own shows or platforms, and they cover a wide variety of topics – but they choose at least some of what they talk about, and what they say, based on where their money is coming from.  Legally, influencers are supposed to disclose paid relationships, but that has not always been the case. BitBoy is far from the first crypto talking head to be caught taking money to promote projects without disclosing that relationship. Perhaps worse, Armstrong has also been caught “pumping and dumping” – that is, hyping up a token, then selling his holdings into the price bump caused by his own coverage. Tokens are often given to “Key Opinion Leaders” as incentives, making the “pump and dump” practically inherent to their business model.  That’s the real core of the KOL misdirect – audiences think they’re getting objective advice from experts. But what they’re really getting is an advertisement disguised as journalism. And that’s where the trouble really starts.  The thought-terminating KOL death spiral  In the Ethereum space, we talk a lot about crypto as a coordination tool – specifically, as a way to coordinate people to work towards shared goals. But KOLs represent a breakdown of coordination: between influencers and their audiences, and more importantly, between influencers and the entire industry.  A KOL’s goal is to get well-paid for talking positively about a thing, while what their audience wants is the truth about that thing, whether it’s positive or not. In short, KOLs are antagonistic to their audience’s interests, whether the audience realizes that or not.  Even more than that, though, I think KOLs are antagonistic to the success of the entire cryptocurrency project. Honest builders should all want information going out to the public to be accurate, because it leads to sustainable adoption and trust of the entire sector.  It’s understandable that projects are individually motivated to pay KOLs to say only nice things about *their* project. But the end result is that everyone is just paying to have nice things said about them – and nobody is telling the plain truth.  That means many would-be crypto adopters wind up led down dark alleys and robbed at metaphorical gunpoint by bad actors like Bitboy. “Professor Crypto” was just a particularly egregious example of a KOL who clearly didn’t care about crypto’s long-term success at all.  Not only the new users, but investors and projects feel trapped and forced to use KOL marketing when the poser detection alarms go off instantly when we see the garbage content KOLs put out. This has resulted in many builders and investors becoming jaded about our own sector, leading to feelings of isolation and desperation.  It’s a race to the bottom that everybody loses.  This town deserves a better class of influencer  You can’t grow a new financial system if the most prominent publicly available information about it is a bunch of Pepsi commercials. That’s one reason we’re doing things differently as we prepare to launch Last Network, a sustainable incentives EVM chain.  Instead of paying social media talking heads to chatter about Last, we’re building a coalition of industry and community figures whose track record, ethics, and ideas align with ours. On the industry side, we’re blackmailing inviting friends we’ve made through many years of building to build trust and help us get the word out. As our community continues to grow in the lead-up to launch, we’ll also encourage regular old crypto lunatics who are obsessed with Last to help educate and welcome others into our ecosystem.  We’ll have more details about those programs soon – and we hope others will follow in our footsteps. More projects unplugging from the KOL cycle would be good for the entire crypto industry: At the very least, it would have saved Polkadot some money and Professor Crypto from whatever upcoming run-ins he has with various three-letter agencies.

33693764,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642562,1726597857,"Shiba Inu Whale Action Hints At Explosive 7,000% Growth","Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had a tough market in the last six months, losing more than half of its value. At $0.0000138 now, the token is down 70% from its March high of $0.000045. Such a plunge is steep and stressful for investors who bought during its peak. Yet a faint glow of hope seems to emanate from the market as it sees a modest 6.5% gain over the last week. Related Reading: Avalanche Revenue Nosedives Over 40% In Q2 – Impact On AVAX Price Crypto analyst LuckSide thinks that SHIB will experience a huge rally in the coming months, considering mostly whale activity as an encouraging reason. Meanwhile, based on an examination by crypto analyst Dexter, and CoinCodex, development may be slightly below par, so SHIB will not be able to boast high short-term returns, but the long-term value is really massive. By the middle of October, according to CoinCodex, SHIB may fall down by -0.51% at best and reach $0.00001330. Whale Activity: The Main Catalyst One of the most impressive developments in the Shiba Inu market is the drastic increase in whales’ activity. In a mere two days, whales accumulated over 3 trillion SHIB tokens, which shows that these large holders and other major investors have regained interest in this asset. Whales have also withdrawn over $4 million worth of SHIB from exchanges; this, in most cases, is an indicator that confidence remains high in the long-term prospects of the meme coin. LuckSide believes this accumulation will spur a strong price rally. He projects that eventually, SHIB can go up to $0.001, marking an increase of 7,145% from the present day. Despite this prediction, LuckSide claims that whales’ movements usually herald a considerable market shift. He also believes the man in the street will buy in if Shiba Inu can succeed in breaching its significant resistance level of $0.000016, which is just 16% higher than its price today. Bearish Sentiment Persists Still, not all digits indicate an upward trend. The current market for Shiba Inu, in the Fear & Greed Index is dim at 33 (Fear). CoinCodex also made some predictions regarding SHIB and it indeed agrees with the conservative point of view: by October 17, 2024, a minute drop of -0.51% is forecasted, and may get down to $0.00001330. Shiba Inu has failed to maintain the momentum after several successive positive movements. The coin had green days only 50% in the last month, and the price volatility remained at 4.49%. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $92,000 ‘Bounce’ In 3 Months, Analyst Predicts Data from CoinCodex and other websites do not consider this as a good buy, primarily due to easy money makers. Broader market hesitancy is reflected in the softened price action that makes the short-term prospects unattractive. Long-Term Potential Still In Play While the short-term future of SHIB is unsure, some analysts still hold hope that the coin will experience a long term upside. For example, crypto trader Dexter says Shiba Inu easily reaches the threshold of $0.00015, which is a 10-fold increase. LuckSide’s model is much more aggressive than Dexter’s model; however, this is much less – but still gives room for optimistic investors to stay and wait. According to him, meme coins like SHIB usually have episodic surges, most especially when whales begin rallying.

42417222,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXHu1,1726597615,FTX’s Accounting Firm Prager Metis to Pay SEC $1.95M to Settle Negligence Allegations,"International accounting firm Prager Metis has agreed to pay $745,000 to settle misconduct allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tied to its bungled audit of FTX before its collapse in November 2022.  The settlement, announced Tuesday, also included a resolution to a second SEC investigation into Prager Metis, which accused the firm of violating auditor independence rules in the audits of over 200 companies between 2017 and 2020. Prager Metis agreed to pay $1.2 million in civil penalties and pre-judgment interest to settle those charges. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC’s complaint accused the accounting firm of negligence-based fraud. In the two audit reports Prager Metis produced for FTX in 2021 and 2022, the SEC alleges that the firm falsely represented that the audits were compliant with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), when in fact, the firm “fail[ed] to comply with GAAS in multiple aspects of the audit.”  According to the SEC, Prager Metis essentially got in over its head with FTX, “not adequately assessing whether it had the competency and resources to undertake the audit” of the crypto exchange.  Read more: Meet the Metaverse Nightclub-Loving Audit Firm that Presided Over FTX’s Financials  “In its rush to accept FTX as an audit client, Prager Metis assembled an engagement team that collectively lacked the competence, experience, and knowledge to appropriately conduct the audits,” the complaint stated. “From this initial failure flowed a series of other auditing failures … The most significant deficiency was Prager Metis’s failure to understand FTX’s relationship with Alameda Research LLC and the pivotal role Alameda played in FTX’s business.”  In addition to the monetary penalties, Prager Metis agreed to permanent injunctions and remedial actions, including retaining an independent consultant to review and evaluate its auditing and quality control policies, as well as “certain restrictions on accepting new audit clients.”  “Because Prager’s audits of FTX were conducted without due care, for example, FTX investors lacked crucial protections when making their investment decisions. Ultimately, they were defrauded out of billions of dollars by FTX and bore the consequences when FTX collapsed,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, in a press statement.  “By limiting Prager’s ability to take on new business and by requiring it to retain an independent compliance consultant, today’s resolutions not only enhance investor protection, they also serve as a warning to audit professionals that are not appropriately meeting their gatekeeping obligations,” Grewal added.

42417238,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXI6P,1726596170,Will Ether’s Supply Crunch Lead to Higher Prices in Q4?,"Many crypto users and investors haven’t been thrilled with Ethereum’s token (Ether) performance over the last two years. With many positive drivers, like successful technology upgrades, scaling solutions, restaking, and the recently approved spot Ether ETFs, most expected these factors to significantly increase demand for the largest smart contract platform’s token. But ether’s price hasn’t delivered.  Can we really point the finger at Ethereum, though? Not really. The overall market has recently been choppy. Sentiment is shaky with mixed expectations – despite rate cuts and regulatory support, the market seems distracted by recession fears, rumors of large Bitcoin sales by Mt. Gox creditors and the U.S. government, and the market’s failure to benefit from the positive economic backdrop. Other looming uncertainties such as the fear of an economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions have only further waned the appetite of investors.  But if we look behind the gloom, there’s another story. Ether’s price might be falling, but its liquid supply is shrinking. If demand picks up next quarter, we could see a supply crunch that pushes prices higher. Here’s why:  The increase in exchange reserves is hardly a glut  Media outlets like FXStreet and AMBCrypto were quick to mention the “significant” supply glut in ether exchange reserves, warning it could ramp up selling pressure and drive prices further down.  This is because a glut (or an oversupply in the market) can put downward pressure on prices, potentially causing a sell-off if enough investors panic and start dumping their crypto holdings to cut losses. We saw this when the German government shook the market by suddenly selling its $3 billion worth of seized bitcoin just a few months ago.  But if we zoom out, this “glut” is less than 1% of exchange reserves, and in reality, these reserves still remain near their all-time lows – 18.7 million ETH, or 15% of the total supply.  Spot ether reserves are even less and now at an all-time low of around 8.4 million ETH. Any inflow is quickly matched by outflows, so any selling pressure is likely being absorbed. The recent uptick in Ether reserves is mainly on derivative exchanges, where Ether is being used as collateral for long/ short positions.  Ether’s 78% gains ($2,282 to $4,066) from January to March have almost been wiped out (now $2,321), yet ether exchange reserves have still fallen by 10% since the start of the year. This is unusual given that reserves and prices are usually inversely correlated; perhaps suggesting that investor confidence in Ether’s long-term value potential remains strong.  Ether staking deposits continue to climb  Even though the price of Ether has dropped 42% from its all-time-high, staking deposits continue to climb, increasing by nearly 20% since the start of the year. Over 34.5 million ETH ($81.3 billion) are currently staked or 28.8% of the total supply, which is an all-time high.  Investors seem either hungry for higher returns by restaking on platforms like EigenLayer (and more recently, Symbiotic) or are happy with a lower risk / lower reward option through traditional staking options and protocols. Either way, dollar values are down, Ether amounts are up.  Demand for staking and restaking seems unfazed by Ether’s declining prices. If this trend persists, it will continue to remove more Ether from the available liquid supply.    Big underperformance  Ether’s price underperformance compared to Bitcoin and Solana has been substantial, with the disappointing launch of the ether spot ETFs (which has mostly seen net outflows) further dampening sentiment.  It wasn’t until months after BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF filing that the crypto market saw growth in the form of a year-end rally. Since then, Bitcoin has risen 114%, Solana has surged 564%, but Ethereum has only risen 27%.  Solana’s token performance and network growth have been impressive lately, with transaction volumes rising by 50% since the start of the year and recently reaching an all-time high of 3.9 million active addresses. But its market share (3.02%) is still just a fraction of Ethereum’s (13.56%) in the current $2.05 trillion crypto market. It is also worth mentioning that most of Solana’s impressive activity has been dominated by memecoins. Is this really sustainable in the long run?  Year-end rally?  After a long period of underperformance, negative sentiment around Ether might be nearing its bottom. An uptick in Ethereum ETF inflows could be just the catalyst needed to trigger the supply crunch and upside shocks in Ether’s price.  With a favourable economic backdrop of falling rates and looser liquidity, regulatory support, not to mention, the growing institutional interest in crypto ETF products (including some of the most conservative traditional investors such as state pension funds), a new wave of institutional inflows seems likely.  Meanwhile, the crypto market has failed to price in these positive fundamentals, so the opportunity is there for a sharp catch-up rally.  If we combine a new wave of inflows with Ether’s shrinking liquid supply, any upside shocks in Ether’s price will be sharp and quick.

Whales Of These Altcoins Have Been Moving Into Self-Custody Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed the trend in the Top Exchange/Non-Exchange Wallet Holdings for three altcoins: Polygon (MATIC), Injective (INJ), and Render (RENDER). Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Succumb To Fear As BTC Erases $60,000 Weekend Recovery The “Top Exchange/Non-Exchange Wallet Holdings” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the balance of the ten largest wallets associated with centralized exchanges and that of the ten largest self-custodial addresses. The ten largest wallets of either type would naturally belong to the whales, the largest of the entities in the sector. In fact, these addresses wouldn’t be just any ordinary whales, but rather investors that are humongous even by whale standards. As such, the Top Exchange/Non-Exchange Wallet Holdings tells us about how the supply held by the exchange-related mega whales compares against the ones keeping their coins in cold wallets. Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in this indicator for the altcoins over the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the Top Exchange/Non-Exchange Wallet Holdings has registered sharp plunges for all three of these altcoins in the last two years, with Polygon seeing the latest one. The plunge in question had come for MATIC on the 9th of this month, with the mega whales moving a pretty significant amount to self-custody. In the days since then, the indicator has continued to decline for the altcoin, although the scale of the drawdown has been nowhere near what was witnessed during the aforementioned plummet. Render’s mega whales made a massive transfer towards cold wallets back on the 21st of July, and the ratio has since maintained at low levels. INJ’s plunge was much earlier, back on August 21st of last year, but the large hands have continued to gradually offload more supply from exchanges since then. Related Reading: Ethereum In Danger: Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Crash To $1,800 Generally, investors keep their coins in the custody of exchanges whenever they plan to participate in trading activities in the near term. Thus, the exchange supply of any asset may be considered as a reflection of its potential sell supply. In this view, the shift that the mega whales of these altcoins have shown towards self-custody can be a bullish sign. The indicator may be to monitor in the near future, however, as any reversals would imply that the mega whales want to sell again and, hence, that a bearish outcome may be waiting for the coins instead. Render Price At the time of writing, Render is floating around $4.8, down 8% over the past week.

33691666,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642611,1726592424,Key Reasons Why Sui Investors Are Buying New Casino ICO Mpeppe (MPEPE),"The cryptocurrency market is always on the lookout for new opportunities, and Sui (SUI) has been a standout in recent months, attracting a large number of investors with its strong performance and technological advancements. However, despite Sui’s stellar growth, many of its investors are now looking at another promising token — Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new casino-focused ICO. There are several reasons why Sui investors are jumping on the Mpeppe bandwagon, and in this article, we’ll explore those factors and why Mpeppe might be the next big thing. Sui’s Strong Market Performance Before diving into why Sui (SUI) investors are flocking to Mpeppe (MPEPE), it’s essential to understand why Sui has been such an attractive asset in the first place. Sui has been performing exceptionally well, largely due to its third-generation blockchain technology. Sui’s blockchain architecture is designed to handle a high volume of transactions, making it one of the fastest and most efficient platforms available. Recently, Sui (SUI) has benefited from the launch of the Grayscale Sui Trust, which has increased its exposure to traditional financial markets. This move has attracted more institutional investors to Sui, driving up its price and market cap. With a current market capitalization exceeding $3 billion and trading volumes up 70%, Sui is positioned for continued growth. Mpeppe’s Casino Ecosystem: A High-Reward Opportunity While Sui (SUI) has proven itself as a robust investment, many of its investors are diversifying their portfolios by adding Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new gambling-focused cryptocurrency. Mpeppe is an ICO that is gaining traction because it taps into the growing decentralized casino market. Its platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging smart contracts to ensure transparency, fairness, and security in online gambling. Sui investors, known for seeking high-tech blockchain solutions, are naturally drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) because it aligns with their interest in decentralized systems. The potential for Mpeppe to deliver massive returns, with some analysts predicting 150x gains, makes it an enticing option for those who have already profited from Sui’s performance. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) priced at just $0.0021, early investors stand to benefit greatly if the token lives up to its hype. The Appeal of Diversification for Sui Holders Investors in Sui (SUI) have seen significant returns, but many understand that diversification is key to managing risk and maximizing potential gains. Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides an opportunity for Sui (SUI) holders to diversify into a completely different sector — the decentralized gambling space. As Sui focuses on blockchain infrastructure, Mpeppe targets the growing demand for transparent and decentralized gambling platforms. The unique combination of a utility-driven platform and the explosive potential of a meme coin has made Mpeppe particularly appealing to Sui (SUI) investors. Many Sui (SUI) holders are buying Mpeppe to hedge their portfolios, looking to balance the more stable growth of Sui with the, high-risk profile of Mpeppe. This strategic diversification could help investors maximize their returns while minimizing potential losses. A Community-Driven Push Another reason why Sui (SUI) investors are flocking to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the strength of the community around both tokens. Sui (SUI) has built a loyal and active community that thrives on collaboration, innovation, and technological progress. Likewise, Mpeppe has cultivated a strong following among gambling enthusiasts and meme coin investors, who see the token as the next big opportunity in decentralized finance. Sui’s community values technological advancements, and the seamless integration of Ethereum smart contracts within Mpeppe’s platform appeals to their desire for innovation. Many Sui holders see the potential in Mpeppe not only as a speculative investment but also as a project that can bring real value to the decentralized gambling space. Timing the Market: Sui and Mpeppe’s Growth Potential Timing is everything in the cryptocurrency market, and Sui (SUI) investors are making strategic moves by entering Mpeppe (MPEPE) at the ICO stage. Sui (SUI) has already experienced strong growth in 2024, with some predicting it could see further gains of up to 200%. However, as the broader market shifts, investors are looking for the next big opportunity, and Mpeppe presents just that. As Sui (SUI) continues to grow, its holders are wisely reallocating a portion of their profits into Mpeppe to capture the upside potential of a new and emerging token. This proactive approach to market timing allows Sui investors to stay ahead of the curve while enjoying the benefits of a diversified portfolio. The Future of Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) The future looks bright for both Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Sui’s technological innovations and the launch of its Grayscale Trust are expected to drive further institutional interest, pushing its price even higher. Meanwhile, Mpeppe is poised to take advantage of the growing demand for decentralized gambling, with its transparent and secure platform offering a unique value proposition. For Sui holders, investing in Mpeppe is more than just a speculative bet — it’s a calculated move to diversify into a sector with immense growth potential. As both tokens continue to gain traction, investors who hold positions in both Sui and Mpeppe could see substantial returns in the months to come. Conclusion Sui (SUI) investors are known for their strategic approach to the market, and their interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a testament to the token’s potential. By diversifying their portfolios with Mpeppe, Sui holders are positioning themselves to benefit from the explosive growth of decentralized gambling while maintaining their exposure to Sui’s technological innovations. As both tokens continue to dominate the market, investors who get in early on Mpeppe could see massive returns alongside their gains from Sui.

42417233,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXI1F,1726592260,U.S. Treasury Sanctions Cambodian Tycoon With Ties to Pig Butchering Scams,"One of Cambodia’s wealthiest businessmen has been hit with U.S. sanctions for allegedly playing a role in serious human rights abuses – including human trafficking and torture – tied to a pig butchering scam operation headquartered in the Southeast Asian country.  Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) announced the sanctions against Ly Yong Phat and several of his businesses, including conglomerate LYP Group and four of his hotels in Cambodia. One of Ly’s sanctioned hotels, the O-Smach Resort, is notorious for its use as a compound for human trafficking victims brought from across Asia and forced to work in pig butchering scam operations.  In placing Ly on the Specially Designated Nationals list, the U.S. is barring all U.S. persons – including citizens overseas and residents living in America – from transacting with him in any way. This could have a serious impact on his business activities, sanctions experts said.  “Because many sanctions authorities authorize the imposition of sanctions on non-US persons – not ordinarily subject to US jurisdiction – for engaging in material transactions with an SDN, many non-US persons will now refuse to transact with Ly, irrespective of jurisdictional considerations,” said Brendan Hanifin, a Chicago-based partner at law firm Ropes & Gray. “Given the primacy of the U.S. dollar in international financial transactions, the practical effect of the SDN designation will be to cut off Ly’s access to most of the global financial system.”  Zachary Goldman, a partner at law firm WilmerHale and co-chair of the firm’s Blockchain and Cryptocurrency practice, said that the sanctions on Ly and his companies extends to all transactions that transit through the U.S. – including dollar-denominated transactions clearing through a U.S. financial institution, even when there are no Americans involved in the transaction.  Many banks, even those outside of the U.S., will not deal with OFAC-sanctioned persons, Goldman added.  Because the sanctions against Ly and his companies will drastically curtail their ability to transact with international counterparties, as well as to access capital, Hanfin said the SDN designation is likely “equivalent to a corporate death sentence.”  In addition to his business operations, Ly is a senator in the Cambodian People’s Party and an advisor to the country’s Prime Minister, Hun Manet. Before Hun Manet was elected Prime Minister, Ly was an adviser to his father, the former Prime Minister Hun Sen.  Victims are lured to O-Smach and similar compounds with the promise of employment opportunities, OFAC alleged, but once they arrive they have their phones and passports confiscated and are forced to carry out pig-butchering scams – a type of confidence-enabled investment scam in which the scammer seemingly befriends the victim over text using a fictitious identity and then entices them to invest large amounts of money into a fake cryptocurrency investment platform. According to a recent report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, pig butchering scams cost victims nearly $4 billion in 2023.  Read more: Investors Lost a Record-High $5.6B to Crypto Scams in 2023, FBI Says  If they try to escape or call for help, victims have reported “being beaten, abused with electric shocks, made to pay a hefty ransom or threatened with being sold to other online scams,” according to the Treasury Department’s Thursday press release. According to reports, at least two victims have jumped to their death from buildings at the O-Smach Resort.

Significant BTC sell orders between $61,000 and $62,500 may cap further rally, Binance order book shows.  ""A lot of the focus will be around positioning into tomorrow’s highly anticipated Fed event risk,"" LMAX Group's Joel Kruger said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} surged to $61,000 Tuesday during the early hours of the U.S session as cryptocurrencies rose ahead of tomorrow's key Federal Reserve meeting, at which the central bank is universally expected to cut its benchmark fed funds rate for the first time in four years.  The largest and oldest cryptocurrency led the digital asset market higher, hitting its highest price since in three weeks at $61,330 before giving up some of the gains. It recently changed hands slightly below the $61,000 level, still up more than 5% over the past 24 hours.  The broad-market crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index, meanwhile, advanced 3% to 1,880, as most altcoin majors including ether {{ETH}}, solana {{SOL}}, Ripple's XRP {{XRP}}, Cardano's ADA {{ADA}} and Avalanche's AVAX {{AVAX}} underperformed BTC with more modest 2%-4% gains.  Despite the rally, bitcoin continues to trade in a fairly tight range and seems unlikely to break out before Wednesday's meeting of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  The BTC-USDT order book data on Binance, the most liquid trading pair on the largest spot crypto exchange by volume, shows significant sell orders between $61,000 and $62,500, pushing against the idea of a further price increase in the short term.  ""Looking ahead, a lot of the focus will be around positioning into tomorrow’s highly anticipated Fed event risk,"" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group in a Tuesday market update.  The market is still uncertain on whether the Fed will cut 25 basis points or opt for a larger 50 basis point move. A bit more than 24 hours prior to the central bank's decision, investors have priced in a 63% probability for the more sizable cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  ""Investors are welcoming the prospect of a larger, more investor friendly Fed rate cut at tomorrow’s meeting, and yield differentials have moved out of the U.S. dollar’s favor as a consequence, added Kruger.  The dynamics are not necessarily that straightforward, as the prospect of larger cuts could cause a panicky reaction for risk asset prices, K33 Research analysts noted. ""Similar large cuts occurred during the 2001 and 2007 recessions, often signaling heightened recession risks in the U.S,"" K33 Research said in a Tuesday report.  However, those historical comparisons could be misleading, as real rates are at their peak with inflation coming down over the past months allowing a speedier pace of cuts, the report added. Market participants currently see the fed funds rate as 125 basis points lower by the end of the year.

Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), are maintaining their position that a chance remains for a bill to clear Congress before the year is out.  That long-odds scenario would require some delicate maneuvering to get crypto matters attached to must-move legislation in the so-called lame-duck session of Congress after the elections but before the new members arrive for next year's session.  ""I really do think we're going to get something done in the lame duck,"" Lummis said at an event Tuesday hosted by Georgetown University's Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. She said an effort still being pushed at the Senate Agricultural Committee could win a bipartisan handshake, then get amended in late-year negotiations to add other necessary details.  If the pursuit of wide-ranging U.S. regulation is delayed into the next congressional session, it'll probably be further pushed into late 2025, Lummis said. ""We just can't wait anymore,"" she said. ""Europe is way ahead of us.""  McHenry, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee who is set to retire after this session, led the strongest crypto legislative effort to date when he got a comprehensive digital assets bill through the House of Representatives this year. He said that effort – backed by 71 House Democrats, including several of the party's leaders – showed ""substantial momentum"" for a crypto bill.  He said legislation would probably have to be linked to a spending package that needs congressional approval this year. But he acknowledged that it might not work.  ""There are seeds that you plant that may not grow in your timeframe,"" McHenry said, adding that the crypto sector now has ""policy footprints that I've left in the sand"" if the debate drags into another session. ""Somebody else's name may be on it when it's signed into law.""  Lummis also reiterated her view that the U.S. should start building a Bitcoin strategic reserve with a four-year buying program that she argues will turn into trillions in value in 20 years of holding onto the {{BTC}}.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/17/us-republican-lawmakers-say-crypto-legislation-not-yet-off-the-table-for-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e3daa6eb8f4e105981a4d3bec6958a4622424c3-3483x1959.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Pix in Brazil and SPEI in Mexico are payment systems established by the central bank of each country.  Circle has connected its USDC stablecoin with payment systems in Brazil and Mexico for corporate customers through integrations with leading banks, the company said Tuesday.  Circle said it now allows businesses to access USDC directly from local financial institutions in Brazil through PIX, a payments system created by the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) in 2020 that has nearly 160 million users. In Mexico it is connected to SPEI, a system powered by the country’s central bank, Banco de México.  Circle's announcement in Latin America comes as the company expands its stablecoins to other networks. Earlier Tuesday, Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, said the company plans to bring USDC to the layer-1 blockchain Sui Network (SUI).  Circle's USDC, the second-largest stablecoin behind Tether's USDT, has a market cap of $35.50 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $6.51 billion, according to CoinDesk price data.  Last week, investment firm Castle Island Ventures and hedge fund group Brevan Howard in a report said stablecoins are increasingly used for everyday finances such as savings, currency conversion and cross-border payments in emerging markets, including Brazil.

33689571,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642462,1726587047,Shiba Inu Competitor FLOKI Forms Falling Wedge That Could Trigger 54% Breakout,"After going on an incredible run back in 2023, top Shiba Inu competitor FLOKI has swam into the mainstream of crypto investments. Its break toward the $1 billion market cap level solidified its position as one of the leading meme coins in the space. Although FLOKI has struggled in the market after its initial bullish run, falling more than 50% from its 2023 peaks, it is still a favorite among investors, and analysts, who expect the meme coin to see bullish momentum going forward. Shiba Inu Competitor Gears Up For Breakout Crypto analyst CobraVanguard has predicted a bullish run-up for the FLOKI price. According to CobraVanguard, the Shiba Inu competitor is forming one of the most bullish patterns on its chart and that is known as a Falling Wedge pattern. This pattern itself is usually formed during a descending market, making the breakout the most important part. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $0.1 Is A ‘Gift’, Falling Wedge Breaking Bullish To Send Price To $0.2 This Falling Wedge pattern identified on the FLOKI chart by the crypto analyst has been forming for the better part of five months now. It began with the initial run-up back in April before taking form back in the month of June when the downtrend began. Naturally, as the FLOKI price fell further, the falling wedge pattern took shape. At this point, a breakout is likely given how long the downtrend has lasted and the recovery in the crypto market. As the analyst highlights, if this breakout does happen, then the FLOKI price could fly from here, rising around 54% to reach the $0.000195 target. However, if the Falling Wedge pattern does continue to form, then the continuation would bring bearish tidings for the Shiba Inu competitor. This could send the downtrend deeper, pushing it as low as $0.000084 before another breakout occurs. Bullishness For FLOKI Continues CobraVanguard is not the only crypto analyst that foresees a breakout for the FLOKI price soon. Another analyst, Cryptollica, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share similar sentiments for the Shiba Inu competitor. The crypto analyst compared it to Dogecoin, currently the largest meme coin by market cap, predicting that the FLOKI price will fly.

However, Cryptollica’s predictions are not as conservative as CobraVanguard’s, predicting that the meme coin’s price will rise above $0.04. This is an over 400% increase in the FLOKI price compared to the former’s 54% forecast to $0.000195. FLOKI/DOGE 🍭🎙#floki 🍈 pic.twitter.com/37DRY5niz5 — Cryptollica⚡️ (@Cryptollica) September 13, 2024 Nevertheless, both predictions maintain the same sentiment and that is that the Shiba Inu competitor is ready for a breakout. With meme coins expected to lead the bull run this time around, it would be no surprise if FLOKI were one of the leaders.

33688853,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642575,1726585204,Long-Term Dogecoin Whale Purchases Their Rivals Shiba Inu and Mpeppe Currently At $0.0021,"The meme coin landscape has seen its fair share of ups and downs, but the loyalty and excitement within the community remain stronger than ever. Recently, a significant development shook the cryptocurrency world: a long-term Dogecoin (DOGE) whale, who has been a staunch supporter of DOGE since its inception, made a surprising move by diversifying their holdings to include Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). This strategic purchase has raised eyebrows, especially as Mpeppe is currently priced at just $0.0021. Let’s explore why this whale decided to invest in their rivals and what this means for the meme coin ecosystem. The Rise of Dogecoin Whales Dogecoin (DOGE) has been the go-to meme coin for years, with a community of loyal investors who continue to believe in its potential. Dogecoin (DOGE) whales, in particular, hold large portions of the coin, and their market movements can significantly impact DOGE’s price. In 2021, DOGE saw astronomical gains, thanks in large part to the influence of whales and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Now, as Dogecoin (DOGE) faces increased competition from other meme coins, some long-term whales are beginning to diversify their portfolios. One such whale recently made a bold move by purchasing large quantities of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), signaling a shift in the meme coin market. Shiba Inu: Dogecoin’s Main Rival Shiba Inu (SHIB), often dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” has emerged as one of Dogecoin (DOGE)’s main competitors. Since its launch in 2020, SHIB has built a strong following, thanks to its decentralized ecosystem and innovative projects like ShibaSwap. With plans to introduce a non-fungible token (NFT) platform and decentralized governance, Shiba Inu (SHIB) offers more than just meme value. This long-term Dogecoin (DOGE) whale saw the potential in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and decided to invest heavily in the project. SHIB’s low price and promising roadmap make it an attractive option for those looking to diversify within the meme coin space. As more Dogecoin (DOGE) whales begin to explore other meme coins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) stands to gain significantly. Mpeppe: The Newcomer With Massive Potential Mpeppe (MPEPE), a relatively new player in the meme coin world, has caught the attention of not only retail investors but also institutional whales. Priced at just $0.0021 during its presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique decentralized gambling platform powered by AI technology. This platform ensures fairness and transparency, which sets it apart from other meme coins that are purely speculative in nature. By investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE), the long-time Dogecoin (DOGE) whale is signaling confidence in this newcomer’s potential. Analysts predict that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could experience a 150x price increase once its platform is fully launched, making it one of the most promising projects in the meme coin space. Why Are Dogecoin Whales Diversifying? The decision by a Dogecoin (DOGE) whale to purchase Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights a growing trend in the cryptocurrency world: diversification. While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a popular and well-loved meme coin, investors are beginning to realize the importance of spreading risk across multiple projects. With Shiba Inu (SHIB) expanding its ecosystem and Mpeppe (MPEPE) bringing innovation to the gambling industry, these two coins offer unique opportunities for long-term growth. For Dogecoin (DOGE) whales, diversifying into SHIB and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a way to hedge against market volatility while still staying within the meme coin market. As more whales follow suit, we could see a significant increase in demand for both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe, driving their prices higher. Conclusion The recent move by a long-term Dogecoin (DOGE) whale to invest in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a testament to the growing maturity of the meme coin market. As investors look for new opportunities beyond Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer promising alternatives. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) still in its presale phase at $0.0021, now could be the perfect time for investors to get in before this coin experiences its predicted 150x gains. As the meme coin market evolves, it’s clear that diversification is key to long-term success.

The Tether-issued stablecoin's supply rose to $118 billion from $65 billion while main rivals struggled.  Tether's USDT, the largest stablecoin, is not only growing larger, it's also cementing its dominant position and now accounts for almost 75% of stablecoin market value, up from 55% two years ago, data by blockchain data analytics platform Token Terminal shows.  USDT supply nearly doubled in the period, growing to $118.6 billion of the $160 billion stablecoin market from around $65 billion, according to Token Terminal. It's the third-largest cryptocurrency overall, trailing just bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}}. The No. 2 stablecoin, Circle's USDC, is less than a third of its size.  Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies whose price is meant to be pegged to a real-world asset such as a national currency or gold, are key pieces of plumbing for the crypto market, serving as a bridge between fiat money and digital assets. They are increasingly popular for non-crypto activities in emerging regions like Latin America and Southeast Asia, with uses ranging from saving in dollars, payments and cross-border transactions, a fresh report by venture capital firm Castle Island and hedge fund Brevan Howard Digital said.  Tether holds over $97 billion of U.S. Treasuries and repurchase agreements in its reserves as of second-quarter 2024, managed by New York-based global financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. Tether earns roughly $400 million a month in revenue from yields on those assets, Token Terminal estimated.  Read more: Tether Hires PayPal Government Affairs Ace as U.S. Scrutiny Unresolved  USDT users said they use the token due to its network effects, user trust, liquidity and its track record relative to other stablecoins, a survey in the report pointed out.  It's also been helped by competitors' woes.  USDC was hit by the failure of one of its reserve partners, Silicon Valley Bank, during the U.S. regional banking crisis of March 2023. While the token quickly regained its price peg, the event drove investors to rivals, mostly USDT. The token's market cap has dwindled to $35 billion from $50 billion in two years.

Howard Winklevoss, father of the famous crypto twins, is donating $4 million in bitcoin {BTC} in a first-of-its-kind donation to Grove City College, where he developed an interest for sound money and the Austrian school of economics that also later influenced Satoshi.  His cryptocurrency donation is the first bitcoin gift the college has received and will fund new business programs, Grove City said in a press release on Tuesday.  Winklevoss said his 'eureka' moment, when crypto first caught his attention, occurred when he realized that bitcoin was non-government, digital money with a fixed supply. ""In short, sound money that works like email.""  He first learned about the principle of sound money at Grove City College while studying under Hans Sennholz, a free-market, Austrian-School economist and professor who studied under Ludwig von Mises. ""Connecting the dots between this economic school of thought and what Satoshi created turned the light bulb on in my head,"" Winklevoss said.  He bought his first bitcoin in 2013, and later invested in ether {{ETH}} and a few other crypto projects that looked like they were also solving interesting problems.  When asked if the twins were responsible for getting their dad into crypto, Tyler Winklevoss said the short answer is yes. ""When Cameron and I first discovered bitcoin back in 2012, no one called it crypto, it was just bitcoin,"" he said. ""There was no Ethereum white paper yet, we told our dad about bitcoin shortly after first learning about it, so we were definitely responsible for getting him into bitcoin.""  But reflecting on his father's gift to Grove City College, it was probably in some ways the other way around, Tyler said, and really our dad who got us into bitcoin. ""I say this because he first discovered the principle of sound money when he studied at Grove City College in the 1960’s and was heavily influenced by the Austrian school of economics that was being taught there. This school of thought also clearly influenced Satoshi.""  He talked about these ideas all the time at home and this influenced us at an early age, reminisced Tyler, and this helped us understand the importance and value of bitcoin when we discovered it.  ""For the Austrian school the best form of money was gold, but there are issues with gold such as portability and security,"" Tyler said, adding that it ""tends to become centralized and moves via IOU's when used as global money, so it loses its decentralized nature.""  ""Satoshi took the best money traits from gold and codified them into digital money,"" Tyler noted, adding that ""bitcoin is not only an asset, but also a network, so it is much easier to send around the world, as easy as an email. This solves the portability problem.""  Their father was very influenced by his time at Grove City College and hence his desire to give back, his son said.  Winklevoss senior has enjoyed a highly successful career in academia and business. After teaching actuarial science as a professor for over ten years at Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he entered the private sector. He was responsible for founding multiple ventures, including Winklevoss Consultants and Winklevoss Technologies, which was acquired by Constellation Software for $125 million in 2023.  ""Our dad is the first startup tech entrepreneur we ever knew,"" Tyler said, ""he was launching software businesses in the seventies. We grew up in a startup environment and this heavily influenced us to create startups ourselves. So in the end, we have Grove City College to thank at least in part for our interest in bitcoin.""  Howard Winklevoss cited his father, Grove City College, and his wife Carol as the biggest influences on his career as a professor and a businessman.  The twin's mother is also an advocate of digital assets. She believes that crypto is the future of money and beyond, and according to Tyler has been their biggest supporter from day one.  The school of business will be officially named the 'Winklevoss School of Business' at a ceremony at the Staley Hall of Arts and Letters in November.

42407619,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0CAR,1726582918,Donald Trump Is Now a DeFi Enthusiast. Here’s Why It Matters,"As the 2024 U.S. presidential election looms, Donald Trump’s venture into crypto – something he once called a “scam” – testifies to the undeniable permanence of crypto as mainstream. Announcing World Liberty Financial, a new DeFi protocol, Trump is positioning himself at the intersection of cryptocurrency and politics. This move by a presidential candidate would seem unimaginable and far-fetched just a few months ago. Today, it’s a powerful indicator that crypto is embedded into our economic and political fabric.  World Liberty Financial, unveiled on September 16, promises a decentralized borrowing and lending platform built on Aave and Ethereum, along with dollar-pegged stablecoins to maintain U.S. dollar dominance in international trade. Yet concerns over the project’s legitimacy and conflicts abound. The initially floated 70% insider token allocation raised eyebrows, suggesting that this venture might be more about financial gain than technological innovation. However, according to Trump’s team, the insider token allocation has since been reduced to 20%, with 63% being sold in a public sale.  Technically, it is Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr., alongside the puzzling designation of 18-year-old Barron Trump as “Chief DeFi Visionary,” who are leading this initiative. Behind the scenes, Chase Herro – a figure with a controversial past and history of dubious ventures – emerges as the project’s real architect. The whitepaper, seen by CoinDesk, shows early iterations copied the code base of Dough Finance, which lost $1.8 million in a flash attack in July. Technical development is believed to be entirely outsourced to third parties, leaving an even higher chance of hacks, like those the FBI warns are being carried out by North Korea.  Lacking technical validity, World Liberty Financial’s hasty launch looks like a calculated move to capitalize on crypto hype. The timing of the announcement, just two months before a national election, adds a layer of political calculation to what is already controversial. But that a polarizing figure like Trump is publicly embracing DeFi – whether he really understands the technology or not – can’t be overlooked.  Cryptocurrency isn’t just a fleeting trend but a defining force, first in modern finance and now in politics. In July 2024 Trump edited the official Republican Party platform to promote defending Americans’ “right to mine Bitcoin” and “self-custody of their digital assets” as well as transacting “free from government surveillance and control.” Betting a political platform on Bitcoin – as Trump is doing – implies confidence that enough of the populace cares about these issues. Crypto has entered mainstream politics.  In the past, politicians and regulators were hesitant or outright hostile towards crypto. Trump himself is no exception, telling the public in 2019 that he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money.”  Reporters have linked Trump’s change of heart to the aggressive attendance of wealthy cryptocurrency executives at fundraisers, who lavished Trump’s campaign with hefty donations. But there are enough other high-profile figures who’ve shown support for digital finance to signal growing belief in its potential: Grammy Award-winning Billie Eilish, tennis star Serena Williams, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and even the U.S. House of Representatives, which approved a bill to create a legal framework for digital assets despite warnings from the SEC.  Crypto is a mainstay, not merely a speculative bubble. What was once a fringe technology is now influencing major political and financial decisions. Enough people know about it – and believe in it – that the genie cannot go back in the bottle. Executives at large institutions are endorsing it. Regulators are creating policies about it to enable broader adoption safely. And now politicians are campaigning about it, and even using it: both Trump and Harris accept crypto donations.  Trump’s engagement with DeFi highlights that we’ve reached a key tipping point. Digital assets are finally looked at for their benefits and not just their risks. How we think about money, investments, and governance is changing as cryptocurrency embeds itself further into the modern political and economic fabric. Trump’s venture may fail, as many crypto projects do, but it undeniably marks a new chapter in our journey.  Blockchain is not just a technology “of the future.” It’s a real driving force of the present. A few years ago, it would be unthinkable for crypto to be a polarizing issue in a presidential election, let alone for a presidential candidate to launch a project. This crossover of DeFi initiatives with the highest level of politics indicates crypto is a permanent fixture in our financial ecosystem, whose impact will be indisputable and long-lasting.

33687297,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642501,1726581608,FTM Rockets 17% Amid Growing Interest In Fantom Ecosystem,"Fantom (FTM) has been soaring 17% over the past week, on a quite decent trend, with strong support recorded in the area of $0.47-$0.48, data from IntoTheBlock indicates. This suggests that the price jump may be connected to increased demand and growing network interest. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $92,000 ‘Bounce’ In 3 Months, Analyst Predicts Approximately 1,560 addresses bought 242.56 million FTM tokens in this range, thereby providing a firm base for the recent run. Crypto trader Mister Crypto mentioned the network’s ongoing development, saying, “It’s one of my major holdings, and I believe it will eventually see a massive leg up.” The trading volumes show growing interest; CoinMarketCap notes that they jumped over 150% last week. Rising Total Value Locked by $2 billion is driving expansion of the DeFi ecosystem. Will FTM, however, be able to overcome crucial resistance? Let’s dig deeper into numbers. Fantom IOMAP chart. Source: IntoTheBlock DApp Volumes Triple Overnight The Fantom ecosystem is also performing well and more so in the dApp space. According to the report by DappRadar, volumes rose from $3.4 million to $9 million within just 24 hours, showing how relevant the network was in decentralized applications. DeFi activity on Fantom has also increased much as data from DeFiLlama indicate that TVL of the network stands at $77 billion. This boom attracts not only traders but also developers and makes Fantom a strong player in the DeFi area. While these developments are promising, the actual test would be if FTM can break through its long-standing resistance level. FTM Hits Major Resistance FTM had been retesting a resistance point of $0.52 for weeks, and, with multiple pushes to break through, it has failed on many occasions, causing each failure to result in a bearish reversal, although there are signs that FTM might finally break this trend. FTM’s CMF has also flipped positive, indicating strong buying pressure. OBV is rising accompanied by an increase in trading volume. Confirmation of the trend will be coming if OBV breaks above its “smoothing line.” Breaching $0.52 will open the way for further rally to the 1.618 level at $0.63. 13. Fantom $FTM This is not a shiny new coin, but an OG coin with a lot of development behind the scenes. It’s one of my major holdings, and I believe it will eventually see a massive leg up. It might take some time, but I think it will happen eventually. pic.twitter.com/hFiGts2X2N — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) September 10, 2024 What’s In Store For Fantom? Mister Crypto shares some optimism about the future for Fantom, saying that all the silent development work is going on in the background. He believes that though FTM may take some time to take off, the network is in for huge long-term growth. The most exciting new development lies in the Sonic upgrade, which should roll out around the end of 2024. Related Reading: Avalanche Revenue Nosedives Over 40% In Q2 – Impact On AVAX Price It means Sonic will bring a new Fantom Virtual Machine, an optimized Lachesis consensus mechanism, and advanced database storage. These upgrades will help improve the network speed and scalability. All these upgrades can make the network more appealing to developers and investors alike. Looking ahead, Fantom’s strong on-chain support combined with some technical upgrades on the horizon keeps it primed and ready to display excellent growth going forward. Despite this, a push above the $0.52 resistance level remains an immediate necessity, the outlook long-term does indeed look hopeful with the Sonic upgrade and growth of DeFi.

42407618,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0CKM,1726580750,"Don’t Believe the Hype, the First Rate Cut Isn’t a Market Disaster","Fear sells. Lately, it seems like every time I open a finance-dedicated website or turn on similarly oriented news networks, there’s nothing but negativity. The bulk of the articles at the top of the page, or the stories being told to me by the anchors, deal with the next pending disaster for the economy and stocks.  Such is the state of the latest doomsday narrative. Federal Reserve officials have endorsed cutting interest rates when they meet next week. It would be the first change to monetary policy since our central bank stopped raising rates more than a year ago. The negative nellies are saying get out of stocks before the announcement date. They believe the shift will cause a massive drop because all the big gains have been made.  But there’s an old saying on Wall Street: the pessimists sound smart, but the optimists make money. The statement refers to the arguments made by both bull and bear investors. Because, quite often, the naysayers come up with fantastic, intricated stories to pitch their case, instead of focusing on the data. As a result, they don’t pay attention to the positive catalysts and miss out on the rallies.  Based on the data I’ve surveyed, the stock market doesn’t tank after our central bank begins lowering interest rates. In fact, the opposite is true: stocks keep going up. The gains tend to track in-line with the long-term average. That will support a steady long-term rally for risk assets including the S&P 500 Index and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.  But don’t take my word for it, let’s look at what the data’s telling us.  That will support a steady long-term rally for risk assets including the S&P 500 Index and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether  Before we go any further, I want to make sure you understand the relationship between cryptocurrencies and stocks. In the eyes of momentum investors like hedge funds, both are viewed as risk assets. So, they’ll tend to move in similar directions up and down.  You see, to money managers, safety assets are things like corporate bonds and Treasuries. They’re backed up by physical assets or the word of the U.S. government. That’s important because in the event of a bankruptcy, bond holders recover money before anyone else while the 14th amendment implies our government isn’t allowed to default on debt (it has yet to do so).  But stocks and cryptocurrencies are a bit different. If a company defaults, stockholders are last in line to receive money, so they’re probably out of luck. And cryptocurrencies don’t have the backing of Uncle Sam, meaning there's potential you could lose all of your investment. Now, that doesn’t mean either scenario will play out, but it tells us institutions view either investment in a similar light. Take a look at the returns from 2018 through 2024 to see what I mean.  So, as the saying goes, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. If we want to understand how scenarios like monetary policy decisions affect the stock market, we need to study the numbers over an extended period of time. That way, we wind up with a decent sample set that spans different economic environments. Then we can get a better sense of the long-term trend.  A great way to see this is by looking at the S&P 500’s average annual return. We’re able to pull the data going back to 1928, giving us almost 100 years’ worth of numbers.  The first thing that grabs me in the chart above are the swings higher and lower. The green bars are years with gains while the red bars show losses. Some of the wins have been amazing, with gains of more than 44% in 1933 and 45% in 1954. Likewise, the stumbles are equally fantastic, with the S&P having lost over 47% in 1931 and more than 38% in 1937.  But the second, and more important item that stands out, is the wins outnumber the losses. Since 1928, I count 65 that were up. As a result, the long-term trend tells us that the S&P 500 Index averages about a 9.5% total return (dividends included) per year. That’s impressive when we consider the size of some of the losses.  However, we want to take the process a step further. We want to drill down on instances at the end of monetary-policy tightening cycles, when the Fed starts cutting interest rates once more. Now, for this exercise, I went back 50 years. I started in the early 1970’s when our central bank was battling high inflation. Back then, interest rates had to rise to more than 20% to bring the problem back under control.  But, by stretching back that far, I was able to come across nine different cycles when the Fed was cutting interest rates. The following table details the S&P 500’s total return (dividends included) once easing started…  On the left, you’ll notice the month and year when the first rate cut happened. Given the meeting can fall on various days during any given month the Federal Open Market Committee meets, I ran the results from the end of each month when the announcement was made. I then ran the returns for the 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month periods afterward.  Then, at the bottom, I show the average return for all of the periods. I also calculated the success rate, or the number of times the returns were positive.  So, looking at the tallies, we can see that there is one time frame when there’s a negative return after the Fed starts cutting. In the three month period after, the S&P 500 tends to lose just under 1%. However, a negative outcome has only happened in four out of the nine instances, giving us a 56% success rate.  The more compelling results are across the other time frames. As you’ll notice, over six months, the market returns 2.3% and over 12 months it returns 6.8%. That’s just below the long-term average of 9.5%.  But what really stands out is the result we see 2 years after the rate cut cycle starts. At that point, the market gains appear to accelerate, generating an average gain of 26.5%, or about 13.2% annualized. Not only that but it has happened in seven out of our nine examples.  So, like I said at the start, fear sells. We’re all more inclined to read about what might hurt our wealth than what will help it. And the negative nellies know it. They understand that if they pitch the doomsday scenario, more people will be inclined to click or listen.  But based on the numbers we just looked at, we know otherwise. The first rate cut doesn’t mean risk assets gains are over. Instead, if others panic, we can use the consequent selloff for our gain. Because history tells us that over the next couple of years, investments like stocks and cryptocurrencies will produce above average returns.

Countries have been describing blockchain and tokenization as the future; experiments have been conducted by the U.K. and Bank for International Settlements.  According to a survey done by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) most respondents believe that a substantial level of tokenization will arrive in three plus years.  The survey consisted of a range of market participants and ""92% believe that financial markets will experience a substantial degree of tokenization at some point, although all said that it is at least three years away"". OMFIF surveyed 26 institutions including treasuries, banks and asset managers across Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.  Countries around the world have been describing blockchain and tokenization as the future. According to think tank OMFIF's survey, 42% of respondents agree blockchain will become the dominant form of financial market infrastructure. Tokenization is the digitization of real world assets.  Tuesday morning UK Finance announced that it had completed an experimental phase of a tokenization, central bank digital currency (CBDC) and ledger platform. Banks like Barclays, Citi UK, HSBC and Natwest alongside seven UK Finance members participated in the experiment.  On Monday, the Bank for International Settlements, considered to be the central bank of central banks, said that 40 handpicked firms had joined it to explore tokenization.  OMFIF also found that 65% of its respondents believed that bonds were the most likely to be tokenized. Bonds are already being tokenized on the blockchain. As of 31 July this year, 14 blockchain bonds have been issued totaling $1.2 billion, which is almost equivalent to 2023 when 16 bonds were issued with a value of $1.7 billion.  Wholesale CBDCs - digital tokens issued by central banks to be used by institutions solely - have also been widely tested.  ""Our survey finds that market participants clearly prefer wholesale central bank digital currencies over other forms of tokenized cash, "" the report said. ""However, effective adoption will depend on robust regulation.""

42407602,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0Ba4,1726578000,A New Prediction Market Raises $3M in Pre-Seed Round Led by 1confirmation,"Limitless Labs, a fledgling entrant to the booming prediction market business, raised $3 million in a pre-seed round led by early stage venture fund 1confirmation.  Paper Ventures, Collider and Public Works participated in the round, said CJ Hetherington, co-founder and CEO of Limitless Labs, the company building the market on top of Base, the layer-2 blockchain network created by crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN).  The raise comes at a time when election betting, particularly the kind denominated in cryptocurrency, is all the rage, led by Polymarket, which has amassed nearly $1 billion of wagers on the outcome of the U.S. presidential race. But Hetherington said Limitless, whose eight-person team has been building its markets for about six months, isn't focused on the election.  One of its specialties is markets that expire quickly, typically concerning the price of a stock or cryptocurrency at the end of a trading day. On Monday, for example, its largest market by volume asked traders to bet whether Coinbase's stock would close above $175 at 4 p.m. Eastern time. Hetherington likened these to the zero day to expiration (0DTE) options popular in traditional finance.  ""People love the daily markets because they don't have to lock up their money for a long period of time to get some mediocre returns,"" Hetherington said. And the turnover keeps traders coming back.  ""The average trader we have on the platform right now is spending around four hours per week,"" Hetherington said. ""So the retention is really, really high. I mean, like 38% of users that come on the first day come after the seventh day, according to our recent data.""  Limitless remains a pipsqueak compared to Polymarket. A Limitless representative said it is processing more than $200,000 in daily transactions, whereas daily volume on Polymarket is in the tens of millions according to Dune Analytics data. Limitless has no external market-makers yet. ""We are about to start those conversations,"" Hetherington said.  Its other differentiator (for now) is user-generated markets. Users with large enough social media followings can suggest markets. If a suggestion makes the Limitless homepage and generates trades, the user can earn rewards, calculated as a single-digit percentage of the volume.  ""A lot of the most popular markets on our platform were not created by us,"" Hetherington said. ""They were created by members of our community, and they've been earning money.""  At least one other prediction market, Hedgehog Markets, has something similar in the works.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,838.51 +0.82%  Bitcoin (BTC): $59,071.10 +0.46%  Ether (ETH): $2,310.05 +0.23%  S&P 500: 5,633.09 +0.13%  Gold: $2,575.42 -0.32%  Nikkei 225: 36,203.22 -1.03%  Top Stories  Bitcoin returned to $59,000 in the European morning, a gain of around 0.7% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, added just under 0.65%. Traders are looking to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday, when officials are expected to announce their first interest-rate cut in four years. The 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices show traders see a 65% probability of a 50 basis-point cut to the 4.7%-5% range. As recently as Monday, the probability was sitting around 50% and a month ago it was only 25%.  BlackRock's bitcoin ETF (IBIT) registered its first inflows for three weeks on Monday, netting gains of $15.8 million, according to data from SoSoValue. Across the board, U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $12.9 million, with a handful of funds' small gains offset by $20.75 million flowing out of Grayscale's GBTC. IBIT is largest of the 12 funds, with assets worth $20.92 billion, but flows have been close to zero since Aug. 26. The three-week period also coincided with BTC falling from over $64,000 to below $55,000. While IBIT's Monday gains were fairly minor, they may still be a positive sign for BTC bulls seeing the sector's largest ETF returning to positive flows.  World Liberty Financial crypto project, which has been promoted by Donald Trump, will launch a governance token, WLFI, team members said during a Spaces stream on X. WLFI will be non-transferable and won't provide any economic rights, the team said. They said they only want token buyers who are seeking to be participants in governance, not those after an economic return. Some 63% of the token will be sold to the public, with 17% reserved for user rewards and 20% going to the team. As of now, the token will be sold only to accredited investors under what is known as a Regulation D exemption from the SEC. Regulation D exemptions allow companies to raise capital without registering securities with the SEC, primarily by offering securities to accredited investors.  Chart of the Day  The chart illustrates the decline in the ETH/BTC price ratio, now at its lowest level since April 2021.  It demonstrates the preference investors have toward bitcoin over ether, exemplified by the significant inflows enjoyed by BTC ETFs compared to the outflows experienced by their ETH counterparts.  Some traders say this shift indicates a broader market favoring bitcoin's perceived stability over ether's riskier, high-yield potential.  - Jamie Crawley  Trending Posts  DYdX to Debut Perpetual Futures on Prediction Markets as DEX Seeks to Raise Profile  UK Finance, Member Banks See Benefits During Experimental Phase of a Tokenization, CBDC Platform  Another Bitcoin Miner Adopts MicroStrategy's Playbook of Buying BTC in Open Market",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,"Jamie Crawley, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/17/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-reclaims-59k-as-traders-anticipate-50-bps-fed-rate-cut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcaa94de08fd9a85dfbab889ad27af67e0368e14-1964x726.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Once dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” SHIB enjoyed its time in the spotlight, gaining millions of loyal supporters and a significant market cap. However, despite these successes, Shiba Inu (SHIB) now faces increasing pressure from new tokens, particularly those with more utility and real-world applications. A key example is GoodEgg (GEGG), a new AI-powered social dating platform that is turning heads in the crypto space. Recently, a prominent Shiba Inu (SHIB) shark, who amassed considerable wealth through early SHIB investments, has publicly endorsed GoodEgg (GEGG). The shark predicts that early investors who bought GEGG at $0.00015 will likely double their fortune as the market responds positively to the token’s innovative approach and growing popularity. Why SHIB Investors Are Moving Toward GEGG While Shiba Inu (SHIB) still ranks among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, its momentum has slowed considerably. Analysts argue that the speculative nature of SHIB and its limited real-world use cases have led some investors to seek alternatives. In contrast, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique blend of AI-driven technology and social interaction, creating a platform where users can earn tokens while engaging in dating and social activities. The AI social dating feature sets GEGG apart from typical memecoins, providing users with real-world utility and financial incentives. As a result, many SHIB investors, including major holders like the aforementioned SHIB shark, are diversifying their portfolios by adding GEGG. The shift has created a buzz in the market, with analysts suggesting that GEGG has the potential to outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the long term. The Growing Popularity of GEGG Since its launch, GoodEgg (GEGG) has quickly gained traction, particularly among early investors. In its second presale stage, GEGG raised over $438,328, selling 58% of the tokens available in the round. The token’s price is currently set at $0.00015, with analysts predicting a substantial increase as demand continues to grow. With its AI-driven platform and focus on real-world social interaction, GEGG has attracted a diverse group of investors, including those who were initially loyal to Shiba Inu (SHIB). Market sentiment has responded positively to GEGG’s presale performance, with many investors recognizing the potential for significant returns. The integration of AI into social and dating platforms provides GEGG with a clear advantage over Shiba Inu (SHIB), which has struggled to introduce new use cases beyond its initial hype as a memecoin. Could GEGG Overtake SHIB? While Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a popular choice for many, its market position could be challenged by tokens like GoodEgg (GEGG). With more investors shifting their focus to tokens that offer tangible benefits, GEGG’s utility-driven model has captured the attention of the crypto community. Some analysts believe that GEGG could eventually surpass SHIB in both value and market cap, particularly if it continues to attract high-profile investors and deliver on its promises of innovation. The endorsement from the Shiba Inu (SHIB) shark further solidifies GEGG’s credibility and market potential. Early GEGG investors who entered the presale at $0.00015 are already seeing the possibility of doubling their investment as market enthusiasm grows. This trend could continue, with more SHIB holders opting to diversify their portfolios with GEGG in the coming months. Good Egg’s (GEGG) Surge In conclusion, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as a serious contender in the memecoin space, offering a unique combination of AI technology and real-world social utility. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had its moment in the spotlight, the emergence of tokens like GEGG is creating new opportunities for investors. As market sentiment continues to favor utility-driven tokens, GEGG is poised to steal the show, with early investors likely to see significant returns.

The prediction market could offer DeFi a unique opportunity to regain attention, d'Haussy added.  SINGAPORE — Perpetuals-focused decentralized cryptocurrency exchange dYdX will soon enter the prediction markets sector, allowing users to place leveraged bets on the outcome of binary events, as it looks to divert attention from centralized trading venues.  ""DYdX will launch perpetual futures on prediction markets,"" dYdX Foundation CEO Charles d'Haussy said in an interview, explaining that decentralized finance (DeFi) needs to offer something special to differentiate itself from centralized venues.  ""The prediction market could offer DeFi a unique opportunity to regain attention,"" d'Haussy said, adding that the DEX is also looking at foreign currency and indexes markets.  Prediction markets allow investors to place bets on the outcome of specific events, ranging from sports, financial asset prices, political events and even the weather, using financial incentives. Perpetuals are futures-like derivatives contracts without an expiry date, allowing market participants to hold positions as long as they see fit.  Augur, launched in 2018 on Ethereum, was perhaps the first to enter the crypto-based prediction market. However, it failed to gain traction due to a lack of liquidity and high fees on the Ethereum blockchain. Today, PolyMarket is the leader in on-chain prediction markets. August trading volume on the platform exceeded $450 million. DYdX's trading volume was $21.2 billion, according to DefiLlama  DYdX's impending foray into prediction markets is a part of the dYdX Unlimited upgrade, which is expected later this year. The program, touted as the dYdX blockhain's most significant to date, will introduce features like a permissionless listing of markets and a master liquidity pool called MegaVault.  The platform's users can propose to list any market on the dYdX chain. The protocol actively maintains price and market parameters,"" Haussy said, explaining permissionless listing. The community is currently experimenting with an FX trading pair tied to the Turkish lira (TRY).  Users who debut new markets will need to deposit a governance-determined amount of stablecoin USDC into the MegaVault, which will then quote orders on that market, facilitating instant liquidity.  The vault will source liquidity from users, who will get a share of the vault's profits plus a share of the protocol's revenue determined by governance. More importantly, users only need to deposit USDC into the vault, and the vault will decide where to provide liquidity. In esssence, it's a passive income strategy, d'Haussy explained.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/17/dydx-to-debut-perpetual-futures-on-prediction-markets-as-dex-seeks-to-raise-profile,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dde5e552299879a8109b2edb57a0a651f76a1fe1-1206x678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This development suggests that the flagship crypto might soon experience significant downward pressure. Binance Top Traders Are Shorting BTC Martinez revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that 51.41% of the top traders on Binance are shorting Bitcoin. This indicates that these traders expect the flagship crypto to experience a price decline despite its recent recovery above $60,000. Indeed, BTC started this week with a price correction, dropping to $58,000. Related Reading: Glassnode Founders Say Bitcoin Crash To $37,000 Wouldn’t Be A Bad Thing, Here’s Why This bearish outlook for Bitcoin suggests that the rise to $60,000 was a relief bounce rather than a bullish reversal. In a recent analysis, Martinez also revealed that the flagship crypto was still in a downtrend. He alluded to the Bitcoin market value to realized value (MVRV) momentum, which he claimed shows that the flagship crypto has been in a downtrend since breaking below $66,750 in June. He added that the trend hasn’t shifted yet. With Bitcoin still in a downtrend, the crypto risks suffering further declines. Martinez highlighted the $58,100 price level as crucial, noting that a break below could lead to a drop towards $55,000. On the other hand, he stated that Bitcoin could rebound to the mid or upper levels at $60,200 or $62,000 if it holds the lower boundary of the parallel channel. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Jelle recently highlighted $65,000 as the price level Bitcoin must reclaim to enjoy a bullish reversal. However, reaching that price level is difficult for now, especially with uncertainty around the imminent rate cuts and the US presidential elections. Bitcoin bulls look to be waiting to see how the market reacts to the Fed’s interest rate decision that will be announced on September 18. It is also worth mentioning that September is historically a bearish month for Bitcoin. This isn’t expected to be different as investors look to October as the month they will return to the market. Bitcoin Could Still Drop To As Low As $15,000 Renowned economist Peter Schiff has warned that Bitcoin could still drop to as low as $15,000. He highlighted what he believes to be a triple top on Bitcoin’s chart. The expert added that the chart is worse if the flagship crypto is priced in gold. At the minimum, the economist expects BTC to drop to the upward trend line at about $42,000, but he doubts it will hold that support line. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $0.1 Is A ‘Gift’, Falling Wedge Breaking Bullish To Send Price To $0.2 As such, he predicts that Bitcoin will retest the longer-term support between $15,000 and $20,000. While it remains to be seen whether that happens, Schiff is known to be a Bitcoin bear and has consistently advocated for Gold over the flagship crypto. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $58,200, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

33680800,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642409,1726565421,Bearish Signal For Ethereum: Funding Rates Hit New 2024 Lows—Is A Rally Still Possible?,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is experiencing increasing bearish sentiment in its futures market, according to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC. The analyst reported on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform that Ethereum’s futures market has shown its lowest funding rates of 2024. This trend indicates that traders in the perpetual futures market are currently less optimistic about Ethereum’s short-term price movements. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Massive Outflows from Derivatives: What Does This Mean For ETH? Ethereum Declining Funding Rates And Market Implications According to ShayanBTC, the 50-day moving average of Ethereum’s funding rates has been on a consistent downward trend, indicating a persistent bearish outlook among futures traders. For context, funding rates in perpetual futures contracts are payments made between long and short traders based on the difference between perpetual futures and spot prices. When funding rates are positive, it implies that long traders pay short traders, suggesting bullish sentiment. Conversely, negative funding rates mean short traders pay long traders, signaling a more bearish market stance. In the case of Ethereum, the current negative trend in funding rates highlights a lack of buying interest in the perpetual futures market. Shayan noted: For Ethereum to recover and reach higher price levels, demand in the perpetual futures market must increase. If the current trend of negative funding rates continues, it is likely that Ethereum will experience further price declines in the mid-term. Is A Rally Still Possible? The impact of these bearish funding rates has been quite evident in Ethereum’s recent performance. So far, the cryptocurrency has experienced a consistent decline, dropping by 4.9% in the past 24 hours alone. This decline has dragged Ethereum’s price below the $2,300 mark, compounding its losses over the past month to more than 10%. The persistent bearishness is partly attributed to the “lack of buying interest” in the futures market, as noted by the CryptoQuant analyst. Despite the negative sentiment in the futures market, some analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s potential for a rebound. One such analyst, Koroush AK, expressed a more positive outlook, suggesting that Ethereum is due for a significant bounce. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts $4,000 Mid-Term Target for Ethereum, Declares End to ETH Correction Koroush pointed to higher time frames, highlighting the 100-week moving average and the key psychological support level at $2,000 as potential catalysts for a recovery.

Negative rates can result in short liquidation cascades, where short positions are forced to close, leading to a sharp price reversal.

42407614,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0C0W,1726561922,"Bhutan, Tiny Country With $3B GDP, Holds Over $780M in Bitcoin","Bhutan, a Himalayan nation with fewer than 1 million people, has accumulated over $780 million in bitcoin, representing nearly a third of its GDP, through mining operations run by state-owned Druk Holdings.  The mining operations are linked to Bitdeer, which has been expanding mining facilities in the country and aiming for a 600 megawatt capacity by 2025.  Bhutan's investment in digital assets is part of a broader strategy by Druk Holdings to diversify revenue streams, with recent wallet activity showing both deposits and withdrawals, including significant transactions with exchanges like Kraken.  A picturesque landlocked nation between India and China has amassed bitcoin {{BTC}} holdings worth over $780 million in the past few years, nearly one-third of its gross domestic product (GDP) and the fourth-largest state-owned stash, according to on-chain analytics tool Arkham.  Bhutan, nestled in the Himalayas, considers its fewer than 900,000 citizens’ happiness a better measure of the country's well-being than money. It is the second nation after El Salvador to officially hold BTC, in this case as part of the state-owned Druk Holdings fund.  ""Bhutan has constructed Bitcoin mining facilities in multiple locations, with the largest being on the site of the now-defunct Education City project,"" Arkham said in an X post. ""Unlike most governments, Bhutan’s BTC does not come from law enforcement asset seizures, but from Bitcoin mining operations, which have ramped up dramatically since early 2023.""  These mines are likely related to mining giant Bitdeer (BTDR). In 2023, the Singapore-based company said it would work with the Bhutan government to establish cryptocurrency mining operations in Southeast Asia and raised over $500 million for the venture. Shortly afterward, Bitdeer said it had built a 100 megawatt (MW) facility in the first phase of the company's project.  In April 2024, Bitdeer said it was working on expanding Bhutan's mining capacity to 600MW in 2025.  Bhutan, which is smaller than Switzerland, has little economic diversification and nascent private sector development. It relies on hydropower, tourism and agriculture for revenue. Gross domestic product, the value of all finished goods and services made in the country, was just under $3 billion in 2022, about half that of the Maldives.  But Druk is pushing into various sectors to expand the country’s coffers. Its site shows “digital assets” as one of the primary focus areas in a technology-driven investment strategy, including hydropower projects and metaverses.  The Druk wallets tracked by Arkham show brisk deposit and withdrawal activity in the past few weeks. It has received up to 2 BTC from Foundry, another miner, and other unidentified Bitcoin addresses several times over the past week.  It has periodically sent bitcoin to other addresses and sometimes to crypto exchanges: A transaction from early July shows a tranche of over $25 million worth of BTC was sent to crypto exchange Kraken, where it was likely sold.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | ARKM,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/17/bhutan-tiny-country-with-3b-gdp-holds-over-780m-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/850c38128aa8b785d3e9dcb693fdf3c390bde105-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33678565,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642396,1726560047,Ethereum-Bitcoin Ratio Breaks 0.04 Barrier: Could Altcoins Be At Risk?,"Today’s Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) trading pair slid below 0.04, a level last seen in April 2021. The declining ETH/BTC ratio could have multiple implications for the wider altcoin market. Altcoins Might Suffer Due To Weak Ethereum One of the key indicators to gauge the resiliency of the altcoin market is the ETH/BTC ratio. The ratio essentially tracks the relative price strength of Ethereum against Bitcoin and is widely considered a metric that could indicate the future potential price action of altcoins. As of September 16, 2024, the ETH/BTC ratio sits at 0.039, a level it last touched 3 years ago in April 2021. In fact, after hitting a high of 0.088 in December 2021, the ETH/BTC ratio has been on a long-lasting decline, barring the occasional dead cat bounce, before further eroding in value. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Nosedives Over 5%, Pressure Mounts on Bulls Regarding altcoin price action, a surging ETH/BTC ratio indicates that Ethereum is performing well against Bitcoin. Conversely, a declining ratio suggests that Bitcoin outperforms Ethereum and other altcoins, which could trigger a shift in confidence away from Ethereum toward Bitcoin. As a result, the wider crypto market might witness a sell-off in altcoins as capital seeks more stable and better-performing assets. Currently, Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) sits at 57.78%, and it can be observed that the metric has been on a steady uptrend since November 2022. An increase in BTC.D further solidifies a weakening altcoin market, hinting that liquidity is exiting small-cap tokens, which might lead to volatile price action and quick price drawdowns. It’s worth highlighting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Ethereum exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) didn’t quite turn out to be as significant an event for ETH price as it did for BTC. Data from crypto ETF tracker SoSoValue shows that the cumulative net outflow for US Ethereum ETFs is $581 million, while the net inflow for US Bitcoin ETFs is $17.3 billion. Can Ethereum Price Change Its Momentum? Ethereum is exchanging hands at $2,282, a price level it last touched in January 2024. Notably, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap briefly touched the $3,900 mark, before losing all its gains. Most recently, it was reported that 112,000 ETH was moved to crypto exchanges in one day, suggesting that investors might not be too keen on holding ETH while its price relative to Bitcoin weakens. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Triangle Formation Hints At A Double Bottom: Breakout and New ATH? Some experts opine that now might be a good time to convert BTC holdings to ETH as they see a potential 180% surge in the battered ETH/BTC ratio. The continual selling pressure on Ethereum has also moved ETH to oversold territory, giving hope to ETH holders that the digital asset has likely bottomed and might soon see a strong price recovery.

42407597,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0BQ9,1726555774,Bitcoin Holds Above $58K as Odds of Big Fed Rate Cuts Jump to 67%,"Bitcoin remains stable around $58,480 with slight movements in other cryptocurrencies like XRP, SUI, and FTM.  The market anticipates the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cut on September 18, which is expected to influence risk assets positively, with a 67% probability of a 50 bps rate cut.  Former President Donald Trump's associated project, World Liberty Financial, announced the launch of a governance token exclusively for U.S. accredited investors.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and broader crypto markets have changed little in the past 24 hours as traders await a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday, where officials are expected to announce their first rate cuts in four years.  Bitcoin is trading below $58,500 at $58,480 and is relatively flat. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the largest digital assets, is up slightly, trading above 1,800.  Daily inflows into the bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) came in at $12.9 million, with most going to BlackRock’s IBIT.  The Fed is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut on Sept. 18, kicking off the so-called easing cycle, which has historically supported risk assets, including bitcoin.  As of Asian morning hours Tuesday, the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices show traders see a 67% probability of big 50 bps rate cut to the 4.7%-5% range. This is a bump from Monday’s 50% implied probability and a large jump from the 25% probability from a month ago.  On Polymarket, traders are giving a 57% chance of a 50+ bps decrease and a 41% chance of a 25 bps decrease.  Elsewhere, the market remains fairly flat. Notable movers include XRP up 3.5%, SUI up 2.5%, and Fantom’s FTM, up 10.5% on continued positive market sentiment from its upcoming re-brand to Sonic.  Trump’s World Liberty Financial to launch WLFI token  On a livestream spanning over two hours, the team behind World Liberty Financial, a project endorsed by former President Donald Trump and his family, confirmed that it was launching a governance token – but only for accredited U.S. investors.  The team emphasized that the token is for governance participation, not economic gain, and did not share a specific launch date during their X Spaces stream.  During the livestream Trump did not mention the token itself or give an endorsement, but rather shared his general views on crypto policy, most of which was a repeat of what he shared during prior public appearances such as at the recent Bitcoin Conference in Nashville.  Figure Markets launches exchange with real estate-backed yield  Crypto exchange Figure Markets is launching on the sidelines of Token2049 in Singapore. Figure, which was founded by SoFi co-founder Mike Cagney, has a unique way of generating yield for those that keep their crypto on the exchange.  Figure says it will be able to offer returns of up to 8% for non-USD and stablecoin balances by leveraging a fund backed by real-world assets, such as home equity loans, according to a release.  Traders on the exchange deposit funds into Figure Markets, which are pooled and lent to Figure Technologies to issue secured home equity loans, a release explains. Borrowers pay interest on these loans, creating a spread that covers costs and provides returns to investors, who benefit from dual recourse protections, daily liquidity, and interest payments that accrue based on the length of their investment.  While Real World Assets (RWAs) are a growing part of crypto, there are very few applications in the industry that attempt to derive yield from them to finance their operations.  In 2023, before the launch of Figure, Cagney withdrew the company’s bid for a U.S. federal bank charter after regulatory scrutiny, opting to focus on partnerships with established banks instead.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Shaurya Malwa, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/17/bitcoin-holds-above-58k-as-odds-of-big-fed-rate-cuts-jump-to-67,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c7cc940bb8d37d1d28af672e7a55271883cfde9-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price is now trading below $135 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $132 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $132 resistance zone. Solana Price Holds Support Solana price started a fresh decline from the $140 resistance zone like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL declined below the $135 and $132 support levels. It even tested $128. A low was formed at $128.85 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $130 level. The price even tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $139.83 swing high to the $128.85 low. Solana is now trading below $132 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $132 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $132 level. The next major resistance is near the $135 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $139.83 swing high to the $128.85 low. A successful close above the $132 and $135 resistance levels could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $140.

Initial support on the downside is near the $130 level. The first major support is near the $128 level. A break below the $128 level might send the price toward the $120 zone.

BTC has seen a $58,000 level during the past day. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Pointing At ‘Fear’ Now The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Ethereum In Danger: Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Crash To $1,800 Market sentiment can be helpful to follow as it can reflect the cryptocurrency’s price. It sometimes plays a role in the asset’s trajectory, which may be unexpected to many investors. The Fear & Greed Index uses data from the following five factors to estimate the average sentiment among investors: volatility, trading volume momentum, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Based on these factors, the metric represents this mentality as a score between zero and hundred. The index having a value greater than 53 implies the presence of greed among the investors, while under 47 suggests fear in the market. The values in between these two cutoffs suggest a net-neutral mentality. Now, here is what the latest Bitcoin market sentiment has looked like from the perspective of the indicator: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 39, which suggests that the majority of the investors in the market are slightly fearful at the moment. This is a notable change from yesterday, when the index had a value of 51, and the holders had been sharing a neutral mentality. The chart below shows a record of all the changes in the index over the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index saw a sharp improvement over the weekend, caused by the recovery that the asset price had enjoyed beyond the $60,000 mark. However, the cryptocurrency has kicked off the new week with a plunge back towards $58,000, which may be why the sentiment has also seen a reset to the fear region. That said, while the index is back in the fear zone, it’s not yet at the 31 value it was at before the earlier recovery. This fact, however, may not be a good sign for the asset. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to move against the expectations of the majority. The probability of a contrary move occurring has only increased the more the investors have become sure of a direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Spikes After Mild Price Jump: Crowd Too Excited Too Quickly? Thus, when the Fear & Greed Index assumes low values (signifying a special sentiment called the extreme fear), bottoms can be probable to occur. Similarly, it being high (extreme greed) can signal tops. With the Bitcoin market being only slightly fearful right now, it seems the pullback in the cryptocurrency hasn’t been enough to deal a heavy blow to investor morale. Naturally, a pullback can still occur for the coin, but it may be less likely if sentiment worsens further. BTC Price Bitcoin has dropped more than 3% over the past day, which has taken its price to $58,100.

ETH is consolidating losses and might struggle to recover above $2,350. Ethereum started another decline below $2,350 and $2,320. The price is trading below $2,310 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,360 resistance to start a recovery wave in the near term. Ethereum Price Starts Consolidation Ethereum price failed to clear the $2,450 resistance and started another decline like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,400 and $2,350 support levels to enter a bearish zone. The price even dived below the $2,320 level. A low was formed at $2,253 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the $2,285 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,466 swing high to the $2,253 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,310 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,300 level. There is also a declining channel forming with resistance at $2,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $2,340 level. The next key resistance is near $2,360 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,466 swing high to the $2,253 low. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,360 on the same chart. An upside break above the $2,360 resistance might call for more gains. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,420 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,465 level. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,360 resistance, it could start another decline in the near term. Initial support on the downside is near $2,265. The first major support sits near the $2,250 zone. A clear move below the $2,250 support might push the price toward $2,200. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,150 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,120.

In a recent post uploaded on X, renowned crypto analyst Javon Marks has laid out an optimistic scenario for Ethereum, suggesting a potential price surge similar to a pattern witnessed in 2023. Related Reading: Ethereum To $4K Again? Analyst Predicts Bull Run As Key Metric Approaches Critical Level Key Level To Watch For A Rally To $8,100? According to Marks, Ethereum is poised to replicate a previous pattern that led to a more than 160% surge. In the post on X, he states, “ETH looks to have replicated a pattern from 2023 that led into an over +165% climb, and it’s looking to be ‘GO TIME’ again.” Marks has set a target price of $4,723.5, adding that a break above this price mark could bring in the possibility of Ethereum reaching above $8,100. This projection suggests a near doubling of Ethereum’s current price if this trend materializes. $ETH (Ethereum) looks to have replicated a pattern from 2023 that led into an over +165% climb and it’s looking to be “GO TIME 🏁” again! 2023 looks to have been the blueprint for another massive upside that can be soon transpiring in this crypto market. Target is at $4,723.5… pic.twitter.com/a1ePw6wpF3 — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) September 15, 2024 Despite this optimistic forecast, Ethereum’s recent market performance has shown bearish tendencies. In the past 24 hours alone, ETH has declined by 4.5%, causing its price to fall below the $2,400 mark—a level it briefly traded above over the weekend. Ethereum Price: On The Flip Side While Javon Marks’ analysis points towards a bullish future for Ethereum, other market analysts have outlined the critical support zones that Ethereum must hold to prevent further decline. Ali, another well-known crypto analyst, has highlighted a crucial support range between $2,290 and $2,360. This zone, according to Ali, is significant as it is where roughly 1.90 million addresses hold around 52.30 million ETH. Ali warns that if Ethereum fails to maintain this support, a sell-off could ensue, potentially driving the price toward the $1,800 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Nosedives Over 5%, Pressure Mounts on Bulls Notably, a breach below this range would be quite detrimental to the ETH market as it would not only trigger a significant amount of liquidations but also invalidate the bullish predictions and lead to a further downtrend, marking a substantial shift in the market sentiment.

The token will be non-transferable offered only to accredited investors under an SEC Regulation D exemption as the team cited regulatory uncertainty in the U.S.  Team members behind the World Liberty Financial crypto project, which has been promoted by former President Donald Trump and his sons, confirmed during an X Spaces live audio stream that they will launch a governance token WLFI.  WLFI will be non-transferable and won't provide any economic rights, the team said on the stream. They said they only want token buyers who are seeking to be participants in governance, not those after an economic return.  Some 63% of the token will be sold to the public, with 17% reserved for user rewards and 20% going to the team. CoinDesk reported some details of the project last week, citing a draft white paper.  As of now, the token will be sold only to accredited investors under what is known as a Regulation D exemption from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulation D exemptions allow companies to raise capital without registering securities with the SEC, primarily by offering securities to accredited investors or in small, private offerings.  “Our goal is to build projects that are easy and simple to use and where you don’t need to phone a friend to get a walkthrough,” Zak Folkman, one of the project’s founders, said during the stream.  The team didn’t share a launch date for the token during the nearly two-and-a-half-hour stream, which brought in over 100,000 listeners.  Polymarket betting  A Polymarket contract asking if Trump will launch a coin before the election peaked at over 80% for the Yes side during the live stream, but sank to as low as 22% as the stream ended.  Earlier in the discussion, various members of the Trump family joined the discussion to share their views on crypto.  Donald Trump Jr. talked about how he sees DeFi as, “what our founding fathers intended for the country,” as it brings back fairness to the financial system.  “Venture Capitalists are flipping sides over crypto,” he said, noting endorsements from the likes of David Sacks and Elon Musk.  Eric Trump said on the session that DeFi needed to be easier to use for regular people, noting the extreme difficulties he encountered when ""looping Ethereum on Aave,"" a decentralized lending platform.  While former President Donald Trump joined the X Spaces session for the first 40 minutes, he didn’t discuss the project and instead shared his views on crypto public policy developments.  ""Crypto's one of those things we have to do, whether we like it or not,"" Trump said.  Another Polymarket contract asking users to bet on what Trump would say during the stream had markets for “Solana”, “Memecoin”, “Milady” and “Doge” but the former president failed to mention any of these.

The attack took $6 million from the project’s pools and is under investigation. However, on-chain investigators suspect it could be linked to North Korean hackers and be part of a larger-scale scheme. Related Reading: Glassnode Founders Say Bitcoin Crash To $37,000 Wouldn’t Be A Bad Thing, Here’s Why Hackers Drain $6 Million From DeFi Protocol On Monday morning, cyber security platform Cyvers Alerts informed the community about the ongoing attack on DeFi borrowing protocol Delta Primes. The initial report revealed that Cyvers’ system had detected multiple suspicious transactions involving the project on the Arbitrum chain. The transactions suggested the DeFi protocol’s team had lost the private key, initially losing $4.5 million from the DPUSDC, DPARB, and DPBTCb pools. The suspicious draining address immediately swapped the USDC for Ethereum (ETH). In the next hour, Cyvers detailed that the attackers had seemingly changed the proxy, pointing to a malicious address. Other reports explained that “this malicious contract can inflate the deposited amount of the hacker on all pools.” The attackers drained another $1.48 million from the pools before Delta Prime’s team regained control. Two hours after the initial reports, the DeFi platform addressed the incident. Per the post, DeltaPrime Blue, on the Arbritum chain, was attacked and drained for $5.98 million. The team confirmed that the attack was due to a compromised private key, with the cause still being investigated. Delta Prime’s team also assured users that DetalPrime Red, on Avalanche, was safe from this attack, detailing that the “implementation here is covered solely by multisigs and cold wallets (as it should be).” Additionally, the post claimed that the risk was already contained, reassuring its community that the DeFi protocol’s insurance pool would cover potential losses: The risk is contained, we’re working on asset-retrieval and the insurance pool will cover any potential losses where possible / necessary. Additionally, we’re looking into other ways to reduce user losses to a minimum. Are North Korean Hackers Responsible? Despite the quick response, some users expressed their concerns about the incident. When questioned about it, the team explained that there were no timelocks for DeltaPrime Blue: This is exactly what timelocks are for. The switch from this hot & non-timelocked owner to a cold timelocked owner should have been done on Arbitrum like it was on Avalanche (and like other initial owners on Arbi) One community member criticized the team for not having the same security measures on DeltaPrime Blue and Red, stating there was no excuse for the mistake. Moreover, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT suggested that the attack could be linked to a larger-scale problem. A month ago, Zach assisted another team with another crypto hack. The investigation unveiled that over 25 projects within the space had unknowingly hired multiple IT workers from North Korea using fake identities as developers. Related Reading: Solana Losses Ground, Drops Below $137 As Bearish Momentum Builds Today, the crypto detective revealed that the DeFi protocol was among the teams he alerted about the North Korean IT workers in August. He also noted that the method used for Delta Prime’s exploit was similar to the hack he originally assisted. As of this writing, Delta Prime’s team has not addressed the possible link. However, it stated that they would focus on getting the funds back and that “the event isn’t over yet.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",NEGATIVE,ETH | USDC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | USDC,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/defi-platform-delta-primes-loses-6-million-in-security-breach-is-north-korea-involved/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/33669084.jpeg

33667006,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642363,1726531245,Bitcoin Alert: Analyst Predicts New ‘Blood Monday’ With 0.50% Fed Rate Cut Looming,"As Bitcoin (BTC) grapples with a challenging market environment, it has struggled to regain momentum, hovering around the $53,000 and $60,000 levels for six consecutive weeks. After losing the crucial $70,000 threshold on August 1, the largest cryptocurrency remains at risk of further declines, particularly with the upcoming Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting on September 18, where a 0.50% rate cut could significantly impact its price. BTC’s Future Hangs In Balance Recent insights from crypto analyst Doctor Profit suggest that the market is closely divided, with equal chances—50%—of a 0.25% or 0.50% rate cut. However, Doctor Profit is confident that the Fed will opt for the larger cut, citing a need for decisive action in the current economic climate. He notes, “A 0.25% cut is simply too little for where we are now.” Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Trims Gains, Can This Key Support Hold Losses? The analyst argues that failing to implement a 0.50% cut could lead to market turmoil reminiscent of the “Blood Monday” experienced on August 5, which saw Bitcoin plummet to lows of $48,900, resulting in a nearly 25% price drop. According to Doctor Profit, this could include acknowledging the Fed’s past strategies and an optimistic outlook for the economy, potentially paving the way for future rate cuts. Given these potential scenarios, the analyst warns of the potential for market manipulation and “scam wicks” that could mislead investors on both sides of the trade. In addition, geopolitical tensions, particularly regarding the Israel-Lebanon situation, add another layer of complexity and may exacerbate market fears and volatility. Despite the short-term risks, Doctor Profit remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, particularly through the end of Q3 2025. The analyst believes that any short-term panic will ultimately be countered by a return to expansive monetary policy, as seen in the recent influx of USDT and other cash injections into the market. He highlights that once the rate cuts are implemented, the Fed’s money printing will likely resume, providing a foundation for recovery. Bitcoin Price Analysis Looking deeper into the current price action, analyst Ali Martinez recently noted that Bitcoin trades within a parallel channel on the hourly chart. Martinez contends that Bitcoin could bounce back to the middle or upper levels if the lower border holds, targeting $60,200 or $62,000. However, Martinez warns that a break below the support level of $58,100 could lead to a drop towards $55,000. Related Reading: Solana Losses Ground, Drops Below $137 As Bearish Momentum Builds Zooming out to a broader perspective, Martinez also highlights concerning trends in Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Momentum. Since breaking below the $66,750 mark in June, Bitcoin has been in a downtrend, and this negative trend has yet to show signs of reversal. To invalidate this indicator, BTC needs to break above this level and reclaim it as support, which could signal the continuation of an expected rally towards the all-time high of $73,700 reached in March this year. When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $58,440, recording losses of over 3% in the 24-hour.
