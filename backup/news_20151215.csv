42426585,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuFxh,1450217767,Two Board Members Exit as Bitcoin Foundation Seeks Funding,"Bitcoin Foundation board members Jim Harper and Olivier Janssens have resigned and been removed from the trade organization, respectively, following a disagreement over the future of the advocacy group.  At an 11am EST meeting today, long-standing disagreements among Bitcoin Foundation board members came to a head over a vote on whether the organization should be disbanded. Both Harper and Janssens voted to shut down the foundation.  In a statementhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/the-bitcoin-foundation-board-and-the-future/, Bitcoin Foundation vice chairman and BTCC CEO Bobby Lee said the organization accepted the resignation of Jim Harper following the vote, a decision Harper confirmed to CoinDesk calling it ""non-acrimonious"".  More contentious was a vote to remove long-controversial board member Olivier Janssens initiated by Lee. The vote was seconded by chairman Brock Pierce as well as remaining board members Elizabeth McCauley and Meyer ""Micky"" Malka.  In statements, Janssens indicated that he expressed his willingness for the foundation to continue, provided it had a plan and a direction for its future, objections shared by Harper.  ""They wanted everyone to start raising money, so they could come up with a plan. I said I'm not comfortable to raise money UNTIL we have a plan,"" Janssens wrote in a Reddit post.  The dismissals by the board members follow the publication of meeting minutes from 20th October which suggested the Bitcoin Foundation has only enough funding to continue until next March, and that recent conference efforts had drawn little revenue.  According to the minuteshttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/bitcoin-foundation-board-meeting-minutes-10-20-15/, the board discussed the prospect of fundraising to continue efforts, and that board members were to be tasked with collecting money from the community as part of the effort.  In comments to CoinDesk, Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton, praised both departing members, but said he feels the organization will now be better positioned for success:  ""It's key for the vision of the board to align, so while it would be ideal if the opinions coincided, ultimately it will hopefully place the foundation in a stronger position with a board that is aligned.""  In a statement, Pierce said he supported Lee’s version of the events ""wholeheartedly"". Malka and McCauley also confirmed their support for the public statement.  Pot boils over  Janssens had long found himself at odds with more prominent members of the organization over his outspoken demeanor as well as his past attempts to inform the community of financial issues at the foundation without the support of other board members.  ""I was a thorn in the eye of the Foundation since the beginning, and they waited for the right time to remove me. The truth is that the foundation is pretty much dead. They will try to keep it going just for the name and ego, but they have no support left with the community,"" he wrote.  On social media, Janssens drew support for his actions, including from former Bitcoin Foundation chairman and organization founder Peter Vessenes, who suggested that he felt shutting down the group was in the best interest of those who had donated to its efforts.  ""I voted for you, Olivier, and floated the idea that we should shut down and just return donations pro-rata to members some time ago; the ones left active on the board are the ones who didn't want to do that,"" he wrote.  In statements to CoinDesk, Harper, who had long served as the organization's global policy counsel, voiced his belief that the foundation ""lacks vision"", but that this was not necessarily the fault of its new chairman, Brock Pierce, or director, Bruce Fenton.  ""The foundation has not had a vision. I think it was poorly organized, and in hindsight, it was erratic. Not enough has changed,"" he said. ""But, I think the community still needs a good advocacy group for the users.""  Path forward  While those involved were in agreement about the day's events, the next steps for the Bitcoin Foundation were less clear.  For now, it must now continue to maintain operations without its full seven board members. In addition to Janssens and Harper, one seat, previously reserved for founders and then reallocated for international affiliates, remains unfilled.  In his statement, Lee stated that the foundation would immediately seek to continue efforts such as its DevCore conference, the most recent of which was held at Draper University in San Mateo, California, in October.  ""In recent months the ED [executive director] has cut costs to a very minimal rate while our foundation also been able to add value to the ecosystem with events like DevCore, the launch of media and speaker engagement programs and other initiatives,"" Lee wrote.  Adding to the questions about the future of the foundation is that Malka and McCauley are approaching the end of their two-year term limit on 31st December.  Fenton, however, stated that the board is ""reviewing the election progress"" and that it may consider appointing members for ""all or some"" of the open seats.  Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Malka's vote was submitted by proxy. It was instead submitted via email.

42426579,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuFhh,1450208418,Kenyan Court Upholds Bid to Keep Bitcoin Startup Off M-Pesa,"A Kenyan High Court judge has ruled that M-Pesa operator Safaricom will not be required to grant access to bitcoin startup BitPesa amid an ongoing legal dispute.  The move comes after the mobile payments firm Lipisha, along with BitPesa, asked the High Court of Kenya for a preliminary order that would enable access while their petition against Safaricom is being considered.  As reported last month, BitPesa lost access to M-Pesa in mid-November when its payments gateway partner Lipisha had its account suspended by Safaricom. BitPesa had used Lipisha as a way to offer M-Pesa as a payment option to Kenyan bitcoin buyers.  Court documents obtained by CoinDesk show that Judge Joseph L Onguto sided with Safaricom in the new ruling, dated 14th December, stating that Safaricom had grounds to suspend Lipisha's account based on the contract between the two companies and concerns it would lose its money transmission license due to BitPesa's work with bitcoin.  Notably, Judge Onguto weighed in on whether BitPesa’s business would fall under the definition of a money transmission company, stating:  ""Suffice however to state now that when [BitPesa] states it is engaged in the business of accepting bitcoin from various countries of the world and exchanging it for local African currencies including but not limited to the Kenya shilling, then in my preliminary view the 2nd Petitioner is engaged in money remittance business.""  Onguto pointed to correspondence submitted to the Court showing that, in the view of the Central Bank of Kenya, BitPesa's use of bitcoin meant that ""it could not use the words 'money remittance' or 'money transfer'"". At the same time, he highlighted a 2014 notice from the central bank stating that it does not regulate virtual currency activity.  ""The petitioners agree, while the respondent does not,"" he said, going on to state that the matter should be explored more thoroughly in a future hearing.  BitPesa declined to comment on Onguto’s comments regarding money transmission, but the company told CoinDesk that it supports the ruling and is working with a firm called Airtel Money to offer services in Kenya as the case proceeds.  ""We are pleased with the High Court's ruling, which permits BitPesa to continue to fight Safaricom's wrongful and unlawful bullying,"" BitPesa said in a statement. ""The Court has not dismissed BitPesa's case, but rather has ruled only that BitPesa is strong enough as a company that it does not require access to M-Pesa to survive during the course of the case.""  The firm said that it is exploring next steps with its legal counsel and declined to comment further. A Safaricom representative was not immediately available when reached.  The ruling comes as the Central Bank of Kenya released a new advisory regarding digital currencies like bitcoin, stating that they are not considered legal tender – a publication that BitPesa suggested could emerge as a result of the case.  The central bank stated that ""no entity is currently licensed to offer money remittance services and products in Kenya using virtual currency such as bitcoin"".  ""CBK reiterates that bitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in bitcoin and similar products,"" the central bank said.

42426590,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuG9h,1450207466,Bitcoin Prices Hit Highest Average Since September 2014,"The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) rose to its highest level since September 2014 today, reaching a press time high of $463.56.  The total is the highest observed on the CoinDesk USD BPI since 17th September, 2014, when the price reached a high of $465.57.  At the time, the price of bitcoin had been in decline since July, a move that coincided with the release of the New York BitLicense.  The price of bitcoin has been trending up amidst the latest saga in the media hunt for elusive bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, as well as increased activity on the Coinbase exchange.  According to data from TradeBlock, Coinbase accounted for as much as 80% of USD trade volumes on 14th December, up from between 10% and 20% the day prior.  Coinbase volumes have since returned to around 18% of US trade volumes at press time, with Hong Kong-based Bitfinex capturing the leader-share it has held for much of December.  Prices hit a monthly high of $470.88 on 12th December, three days after the release of articles by Wired and Gizmodo connecting Nakamoto to Australian businessman Craig Wright, in what has became one of the year’s most widely covered bitcoin events.  Coinbase did not respond to requests for comment on the exchange’s uptick in activity.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/15/bitcoin-prices-hit-highest-average-since-september-2014,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f894abab6f674f8290dc445fe9f680a748a89a0-1219x583.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378472,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIi3,1450203009,Australian Central Bank Chief: Questions About Blockchain Remain,"Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Glenn Stevens has issued new comments on blockchain technology as part of a broader conversation on the APAC nation's economic outlook for 2016.  Speaking to The Australian Financial Review, Stevens voiced his belief that the country's banks should investigate the potential benefits of the distributed ledger, which he suggested was the true innovation behind bitcoin.  ""Blockchain is actually the bit about bitcoin that was, I think, the really clever bit,"" Stevens told the news source, adding:  ""In areas where you've got a centralized ledger, the question is whether the distributed way of doing it will end up being more efficient and cheaper.""  The acting head of the country's central bank since 2006, Stevens went on to state that domestic businesses are seeking answers to such questions, a process he called ""important"" and ""fascinating"".  Elsewhere, Stevens advocated for new financial technologies broadly, voicing his belief that regulators should be willing to allow potential innovations to develop.  The comments come as those in the blockchain industry are increasingly viewing the Australian market as one of first likely to adopt the technology, even while local startups struggle to gain access to banking services.  In a panel session at Finnovasia last week, for example, WIP Solutions CEO Alex Edana predicted that Australia would be ""the first market on the blockchain"", due to reports local banks are already collaborating on ways to test the technology.  Stevens' remarks were some of the first from the Australian central bank since 2014, when it issued findings that bitcoin was unlikely to destabilize the domestic payments system.
