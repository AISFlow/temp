42379027,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mmnp,1480545663,A Judge Just Cleared the Way for the IRS to Seek Coinbase Customer Data,"The IRS can now serve bitcoin and ether exchange startup Coinbase with a summons for information about its users, a federal judge ruled today.  In an order dated 30th November, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley sided with a request filed earlier this month by the IRS as part of its bid to investigate alleged tax violations in the US pertaining or connected to digital currency use.  When reached for comment, Coinbase said that it expected the order and that it would release a formal statement.  The company later said:  ""We are aware of, and expected, the court’s ex parte order today. We look forward to opposing the DOJ’s request in court after Coinbase is served with a subpoena. As we previously stated, we remain concerned with our US customers’ legitimate privacy rights in the face of the government’s sweeping request.""  Following the issuance of the court order, the US government celebrated the development.  ""Transactions in virtual currency are taxable just like those in any other property. The John Doe summons is a step designed to help the IRS ensure people doing business in the emerging economy are following the tax laws and meeting their responsibilities,"" IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said.  The IRS is seeking Coinbase user records from between 31st December, 2013 and 31st December, 2015. The startup said after the agency’s initial filing that it would oppose the effort.  Since mid-2015, the IRS has considered bitcoin and other digital currencies as kinds of taxable property. A recent report from the agency’s inspector general, however, blasted the IRS for a failure to develop a cohesive strategy for digital currency taxation – something that tax professionals have criticized it for as well.

42379031,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mmsr,1480534599,Japan Exchange Group Expands Blockchain Trials,"The Japan Exchange Group (JPX) has formed a consortium between several companies within its umbrella to test a blockchain market infrastructure proof-of-concept.  JPX announced today that the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Exchange, alongside the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, would test the prototype collaboratively. In February, JPX announced that it was working with IBM’s Japanese division to test blockchain, using the tech firm’s Fabric blockchain platform as a basis for experimentation.  The newly announced initiative builds on that early partnership. The Tokyo Stock Exchange will jointly develop what JPX called a “test environment” with IBM Japan, after which they and other JPX firms will begin testing. JPX said that the trial is set to begin next spring.  In a statement, JPX said that it would seek to attract other stakeholders – including those that actually conduct trades on the exchanges – to the consortium, with an eye to expand its membership within Japan. JPX said that it would begin soliciting new members at the beginning of 2017.  The firm said:  “We will seek participation from a wide range of Japanese financial institutions in order to gather broad industrial expertise. Members of the consortium will conduct PoC testing and discuss the applicability of DLT to the capital market infrastructure, both from technical and operational perspectives.”  According to JPX, the ecosystem it wants to explore would included roles for securities companies, the exchanges and technology vendors that would actually develop the systems. The group said today that it envisions applications being built on top of Fabric by the exchanges or other institutions that become involved.

42379022,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mmin,1480528202,Illinois Unveils Blockchain Policy in Bid to Attract Industry Innovators,"What started as an early experiment by the state of Illinois to offer insurance services on a blockchain has expanded into a formal state-wide initiative.  Announced today at Blockchain Conference Chicago, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative, a first-of-its-kind consortium comprised not just of companies – but of five government agencies, is a far-reaching measure aimed at not only making it easier for startups to innovate but removing barriers for the government to build with blockchain.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, Bryan Schneider, expanded on his remarks made during the formal announcement today.  Schneider stated:  ""The fact that we've got all these agencies willing to come together and share best practices, share ideas, at some point share what they're hearing, I think is an incredibly powerful engine and shows the degree to which Illinois government is doing its best to break down those barriers.""  In addition to Schneider’s department, founding members of the Illinois Blockchain Initiative are the State Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO), the Department of Insurance (DOI), Cook County's Recorders of Deeds and the the newly formed Department of Innovation & Technology (DoIT).  The moves by the Illinois government to create a more welcoming environment for blockchain companies follows other state efforts that have been met with mixed results. While New York’s Bitlicense (unveiled last year) removed uncertainty, it is also widely blamed for pushing out startups that lacked the resources to stay compliant.  In response, New Jersey and Delaware announced their own initiatives to attract industry business, though only the latter has grown in scope since it was revealed.  Since introducing its work in May, Delaware has gone on to push for the legal classification of blockchain shares, culminating most recently in calls by officials to move proxy voting to a blockchain.  Areas of focus  During Schneider's full remarks, he broke down the initiative into three more specific areas of focus.  The inter-agency consortium's first goal, he said, is to create a welcoming regulatory environment for digital currency and blockchain businesses looking to do business; the second is to invite blockchain companies to open up offices in the state; and the third is to develop specific blockchain prototypes for use by the Illinois government.  As part of a coordinated effort to accelerate the process of integrating blockchain technology, the Department of Innovation and Technology today also released a request for information (RFI) soliciting input and feedback from the blockchain community.  Though the state is hoping to leverage the influence of incumbents such as CME Group (based in Chicago), its chief technology officer, Mike Wons said he hopes the initiative will jump-start a flow of startups — and jobs — to the region.  Wons told CoinDesk:  ""When you look at it it is goin to require a lot of the entrepreneurial startups to come into the environment and help solve the problems. The bigger vendors are the platform providers, but they aren’t necessarily the enablers.""  Early stirrings  Though still in its earliest phases, the multiple agencies involved in the consortium have already reported making progress in identifying a broad range of use cases in which a shared, immutable distributed ledger could simultaneously save tax-payer resources while increasing tax-payer access to services.  Last month, Illinois director of the Department of Insurance, Melissa Dowling, revealed the formation of a working group tasked to develop a blockchain strategy.  At the time, Dowling cited concerns that a lack of unity might slow progress, even as her own department was exploring how blockchain could speed the process by which actuaries determine the financial consequences of an event.  Schneider reiterated her concern, adding that the cross-industry initiative was designed to make sure that didn't happen.  His own Department of Financial and Professional Regulation is currently looking into building blockchain applications that could streamline the transaction of mortgages by giving counterparties access to the same ledger of account.  Schneider said:  ""We don’t have to promulgate a subpoena on a company and say 'Give me all your records,' because we've created a blockchain ledger where everyone agrees that's what's happened.""  Jobs capital  While cryptocurrency and blockchain companies have largely settled into either California or New York, today's news is part of a concerted push by the highest level of the state's government to push that momentum from the coasts to the US heartland.  Building on Chicago's history as a financial center, the state's entrepreneurial-minded governor and founder of the GTCR private equities firm, Bruce Rauner, earlier this year launched the Department of Innovation and Technology (DOIT).  Led by CIO Hardik Bhatt, the department was in part established to help consolidate the state's 420 separate financial reporting systems, according to a State Journal Register report.  But as a founding member of the Illinois blockchain initiative, DOIT is also part of the blockchain consortium's larger push to bring financial technology jobs to the state.  ""Governor Rauner is committed to making Illinois the jobs capital of the Midwest and an important component of that is technological innovation,"" said Schneider.  ""I think to some extent this is about communicating to the world that this is a state and a state government that takes technological innovation seriously.""  Removing business uncertainty  Also announced today, the acting director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, Sean McCarthy, has appointed assistant deputy director of entrepreneurship, innovation and technology, Jennifer O'Rourke as the first blockchain business liaison.  O'Rourke describes her role as a ""facilitator of resources"" for blockchain entrepreneurs, which currently include grants or tax incentives.  O'Rourke says the program could evolve to include other support.  As part of IBI's push to make Illinois more hospitable to blockchain startups, Schneider today is expected to unveil the state’s ""Digital Currency Regulatory Guidance"", intended to make clear how the IDFPR will treat digital currencies in relation to the Illinois’ Transmitters of Money Law.  At the time of publication this guidance had not yet been made public, though the public is expected to be invited to comment on the guidance prior to its formalization.  Schneider concluded:  ""Regulation is a dangerous thing if not done carefully. It can stifle innovation, stifle job creation. So we want to make sure we don’t’ do that. But we also don’t want to leave the regulated community in a constant state of uncertainty.""

42379025,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mmqL,1480524159,IBM Tests Blockchain for Supply Chain With India’s Mahindra Group,"Indian business conglomerate Mahindra Group is working with IBM to develop blockchain-based supply chain applications.  Announced today, the partnership sees the two firms working on a prototype tool for tracking supply chain transactions via blockchain. Mahindra, a major business group in India, has operations in industries ranging from aerospace to automotives, as well as agriculture, finance and technology.  The collaboration comes as India’s business and finance sectors continue exploring the tech. Various banks in the country have been testing blockchain for use in cross-border payments and transaction settlement. Other firms, including IT consultancy Tata, have pursued various proofs-of-concept, while startups working in the bitcoin space have continued to develop products.  For now, Mahindra is testing the waters with the supply chain prototype, but the conglomerate says that it is looking at other applications across its various business lines, including agricultural technology and transportation.  Anish Shah, Mahindra’s group president for strategy, said in a statement:  “This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business.”  The company has been testing blockchain internally as part of a broader push to investigate new technologies. In June, Shah told Indian news source Mint that it was considering the tech for use in supply chain management.

42379039,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mn1f,1480517206,Blockchain Pros Debate 'Looming Challenges' for Smart Contracts,"Just because a repetitive job could be replaced with self-executing code on a blockchain, doesn't mean it should be.  A group of Wall Street insiders and blockchain innovators took to the stage yesterday at the New York Law School in Manhattan to sort through when a smart contract is a bad idea, when it's a good idea and what stands in the way of widespread proliferation of the technology.  ""There are some looming grand challenges,"" said Ari Juels, professor at Cornell Tech and co-director at the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3).  Speaking on a panel about implementing legally sound, secure smart contracts, at an event hosted by the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance Juels broke down the key obstacles into two main categories.  First, he says there's a pull within the industry toward confidentiality. While financial institutions and other players in the space hail the benefits of transparency, they hesitate to put their information on a blockchain.  Key directions Juels sees in the resolution of this apparent dichotomy are two technology solutions.  First, he listed software-based solutions run with zero-knowledge proofs like the zk-SNARK technology upon which Zcash was built. The technology allows counterparties to control how much information they share about themselves as well as who can see that information.  But he also listed a hardware solution. Specifically, Juels said Intel's Software Guard Extensions will help strike the balance between confidentiality and transparency.  Intel's Hyperledger contribution, Sawtooth Lake, is powered by a consensus algorithm called PoET (Proof of Elapsed Time), which is intended to run in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), including Intel SGX.  ""Tools like zero-knowledge proof and SGX can let blockchain users have their cake and eat it too,"" said Juels.  Ensuring accuracy  The other ""looming challenge"" facing smart contract development is accuracy.  According to Joshua Ashley Klayman, who serves as special counsel to the finance and projects group at Morrison Foerster, the problem can be articulated as such: ""How do you make sure the code matches what you think is in the contract?""  While Juels argued for widespread use of bug bounties to find inaccuracies, and so-called escape hatches to prevent a contract from executing in certain circumstances, Klayman said the key to accuracy is simplicity.  ""Typically, we tend to say the simpler the transaction the better,"" said Klayman, who is also a founding member of the firm's blockchain and smart contracts group. ""The less discretion the better.""  But there is also an underlying trait of smart contracts that coincides with what Juels described as the need for accuracy. The smart contract must also be upgradable and interpretable. Juels calls this ""enshrining ambiguity.""  'Code is law' debated  While one of the strengths of a smart contract is its incredible accuracy, that is also one of its weakness, Juels argued.  The extreme example of this is the ""code is law"" philosophy that there should be no natural language counterpart to a blockchain-based smart contract.  In the case of the first large-scale use of such smart contracts, The DAO was unable to fix its own code once it had launched because changing that code amounted to changing the terms the existing users had agreed to. The result was the slow draining of funds as the cryptocurrency community could do little more than watch until more drastic solutions were conceived.  Preston Byrne, COO and general counsel of Monax Industries and a long-time critic of certain implementations of smart contracts, described the ""code is law"" philosophy as ""snazzy marketing nonsense"" spouted by ""non-lawyers"".  Havell Rodrigues, co-founder and CEO of Adjoint, explained how the next generation of smart contracts must give at least a modicum of access to the community using them.  Rodrigues said:  ""You want to make sure that business users, legal users, can ask questions of the smart contract.""  Bad smart contract  The group of blockchain professionals also addressed what not to do when building smart contracts and what not to build.  As a general rule, smart contracts only bring value in proportion to how frequently they’re used. So, single use contracts and rarely used contracts aren’t likely valuable use cases, they said.  Also, a smart contract is only as valuable as the intermediaries it disrupts. Services that are already largely conducted directly between counterpartires are less likely to bring value to the builder.  But not every example of what not to do was based on design principles.  When asked directly by moderator Richard Johnson, of Greenwich Associates, what kinds of smart contracts are a bad idea, Juels said that ""smart contracts actually present a lot of opportunities for crime"".  Specifically, he listed contracts that pay out automatically when an arson is committed and a person is killed as opportunities that shouldn’t be built.  Standard smart contracts  Along the path to widespread smart contract adoption more needs to be accomplished that just overcoming obstacles and avoiding wasted resources.  In a separate address the founder of Enterprise Data Management (EDM) Council Mike Meriton argued that smart contract standards currently being developed would be the final step towards widespread adoption.  Last week, Swift unveiled its own proof-of-concept built with Byrne's Eris software and the Tendermint consensus engine designed in part to show how the ISO20022 standard might function on a blockchain.  Earlier this year, the Bankers Association of Finance and Trade (BAFT) made key hires to expand its own blockchain standards exploration. The following month the European branch of the International Securities Association for Institutional Trade Communication (ISITC) proposed 10 blockchain benchmarks.  While previous standards efforts appear to be focused on blockchain interoperabilty, Meriton says that, generally speaking, the EDM Council’s Financial Business Industry Ontology (FIBO) project has taken aim squarely at smart contracts.  The non-profit trade association with over 200 members is currently in advanced proof-of-concept phase with its FIBO standard which is registered with the Object Management Group. The FIBO standard is based on the actual language of a traditional contract and is designed to ""stand up to heavy-duty processing requirements"" of frequently transacted contracts across platforms.  ""The objective for scaling blockchain is to leverage standards like ISO and FIBO,"" said Meriton. ""There’s tremendous potential.""  The EDM founder said he is currently in conversation with Digital Asset Holdings, Consensys and R3 and earlier this year conducted a test with Wells Fargo, State Street and Deutsche Bank. He expects a series of POC’s built on the standard to be released by the end of 2017.  Meriton concluded:  ""We're sort of having a coming out party with these capabilities as we speak.""

A full quarter of the Hyperledger membership is now based in China, the project’s representatives said today – a reflection of a push to encourage more stakeholders in the country to join and play an active role. According to executive director Brian Behlendorf, the growing ranks are a signal of support for open-source development of the technology.  He said in a statement:  ""The growth and support across the globe is a testament to the need for an open source initiative, like Hyperledger, that accelerates the development of blockchain software and systems to reinvent industries.""

42379030,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mmu7,1480508904,WeChat-Inspired Wallets Are Coming to Ethereum,"Ethereum will soon see its first wallet with a WeChat-like interface.  Expected to launching in alpha in the coming weeks, Status aims to provide a new interface for ethereum, one that more closely resembles popular apps users are accustomed to. Namely, with Status, users can call up and control decentralized applications (dapps) with instant messages from the mobile wallet.  The Android and iOS light client were inspired by the multi-purpose social messaging app WeChat, which, in addition to offering messaging, also allows users to pay for groceries and explore social media updates.  Status co-founder Carl Bennetts explained the idea was to build an interface that the average person will understand, so that they can tap the ""new world"" of crypto-technologies.  Bennetts told CoinDesk:  ""What we came up with was a sort of hybrid between a messenger and a browser, with the idea that you can chat with decentralized applications in the same way that you would chat with your friends.""  Ethereum's popular Mist wallet, funded by the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, has expressed similar vision for making browsing and interaction with so-called dApps easier, although Status is unique in that it makes dApps summonable by instant message.  Entering alpha  It still might be a ways to go before it's ready, however.  The alpha release will be a stripped down version of what Status intends to offer in the long run, intended mostly for developers (like ethereum itself in its current form).  One exciting component, according to Bennetts, is that users can use encrypted chat brought to the table by ethereum's Whisper protocol, which he sees as a needed departure from the client-server model used by most encrypted messaging apps. He also emphasized that Status is among the first apps to use the decentralized chat protocol.  Other features are available so that developers can poke around.  Users can send requests to store ether (although Bennetts mentioned that users shouldn't do this with ""any meaningful amount"" while it’s still in the experimental stages) and browse existing dapps, similar to the Mist browser.  The vision  The mobile wallet is also a sign that developers are beginning to think about more about how users can use the technology down the road.  Although there are other wallets out there, interfaces made for the average person have been far and in between.  One futuristic slide even shows a user hailing a self-driving cab with an instant message and an ether payment.  ""There is no real distinction between a friend and a dapp,"" reads the Status presentation slides from Devcon.  When asked if making smart contracts easier to use could potentially be hazardous given recent bugs and security problems linked with ethereum smart contracts, Bennett nodded to The DAO collapse, arguing that it was an example of developers using ethereum as if it was production-ready when it really wasn’t.  He added that he's optimistic that ethereum smart contract security will continue to progress.  ""Security is going to be taken more and more seriously, and provided that we have some sort of a standard before we throw these dapps out to our userbase and have very intense security orders, I still think ethereum is a better system,"" he said.  But, while security isn't Status's main focus, it does go to show that despite recent ethereum infrastructure issues, developers are continuing work on forward-thinking projects to improve its ecosystem.

42379034,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mmxt,1480498526,R3 Releases Code for Distributed Ledger Tech Corda,"R3CEV, the startup behind the world's largest banking consortium focused on distributed ledger applications, has made the code for its Corda platform freely available.  The open-source release coincides with R3's contribution of the code to the Hyperledger project, the Linux Foundation-led blockchain effort first launched late last year. From here, the code goes to the Hyperledger group for formal acceptance.  Corda  is envisioned as a permissioned distributed ledger enabling the management of legal agreements between financial institutions, with restrictions on which parties can see what types of information.  R3 has posted the codebase and other resources here.  The release perhaps caps a year of experimentation among the dozens of banks that compose the R3 consortium. Since January, groups of R3 banks have explored use cases in the areas of trade finance, digital identity and asset exchange. It also comes as R3 is raising funds from its membership, a process that has seen some of its members part ways with the group.  In a blog post published ahead of the release, R3 CTO Richard Gendal Brown explained that the release followed a debate within the company about at which stage the code for Corda should be published, writing:  ""We've wholeheartedly chosen the latter path: to release early and to work openly.""  Brown went on to express hope that the release would spur outside observers to dig into the code and unearth bugs, saying: ""You will find gaps, issues, problems. But that’s fine: please do share what you find. Even better, submit a fix…!""  R3 is also publishing a draft of its Corda technical paper, with plans to release an update from developer Mike Hearn regarding the work set to be done on the code. The company said it also plans to develop a commercial version of Corda, as well as continue work on other products that will use the open-source platform as a basis.  At the same time, the Corda code will the join ranks of IBM’s Fabric, Intel’s Sawtooth Lake and other platform concepts accepted thus far to the Hyperledger project. According to Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf, the code release is part of the acceptance process, which he said ""shouldn’t take that long"".  Behlendorf described the Corda contribution as ""just the first step"", echoing Brown in expressing hope that other contributors would become involved. He also suggested that the concepts behind Corda might influence further work on other Hyperledger projects.  Behlendorf concluded:  ""That kind of sharing of DNA is something we think is a good idea and something we look forward to.""
