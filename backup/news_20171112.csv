42380060,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LmYf,1510493421,Flimsy Floor? Bitcoin Charts Suggest Price Decline In Play,"The price of bitcoin appears to be stabilizing.  Amid what has been a wild weekend in the crypto markets, BTC is now down just 5 percent in the last 24 hours to a value of $6,102. Yet, that number doesn't tell the whole story, as the cryptocurrency has been in the midst of heavy volatility after hitting a near three-week low below $5,600 earlier today.  As the charts show, the record rally from the September lows below $3,000 now appears to have topped out at $7,850 last week after a decision to abandon a controversial software upgrade triggered an unwinding of trading positions. The move appears to be sparking a migration of funds to alternative protocols, with bitcoin cash emerging as the primary beneficiary – effectively tripling in price since Thursday.  So far, the bitcoin sell-off appears for real as volumes jumped 61 percent yesterday. A high volume sell-off is often considered as a sign of ""panic,"" and the fact that Google search volumes revisited record highs further corroborates this view.  So, the question now is, how low can prices go?  If history is any guide, the current sell-off in bitcoin is likely to run out of steam below $5,000.  Case I: Rally from July low to September high  Bitcoin chart  Case II: Rally from April low to June high  It is quite clear that:  The rally ends with a bearish price RSI divergence.  The sell-off comes to a halt around the 61.8 percent Fib and below the 100-day MA.  Where is the floor?  The current retreat in prices looks similar to Case I and Case II as the rally ended with a bearish price RSI divergence.  Bitcoin chart  The RSI is trending lower and well short of the oversold territory. Thus, there is potential for a continued sell-off.  The sharp recovery from the 50-day MA seen today indicates bitcoin could trade sideways for the next couple of days before resuming the drop.  As historical data shows, the current sell-off is likely to leave a major higher low around the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement ($4,855.59) and below the 100-day MA ($4,818). Over the next few days, the 100-day MA is seen sloping upwards to $5,000-$5,100 range.  View  Prices could trade sideways over the next few days.  The current sell-off could come to a halt around $4,900-$5,000.  Only a multiple 1-hour closes above $6,500 would warrant caution on the part of the aggressive bears.  Price action discussed below could be considered as a sign of a bullish trend reversal:  A solid rebound from near 100-day MA & 61.8% Fibonacci retracement (as history suggests) or  The prices close today around $6,200 and tomorrow's candle ends beyond $6,900.

42380042,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LmH3,1510485615,Assets Will Be Tokens (And It Will Change Finance),"Dr Pavel Kravchenko holds a PhD in technical sciences and is the founder of Distributed Lab.  In this opinion piece, the first of a two-part series, Kravchenko argues that tokenization of assets using blockchains will have more profound effects on the world's markets than simply reducing back-office record-keeping costs.      Would you swallow a random pill that you saw on the counter in the pharmacy? Of course not. You don't know anything about it!  But what if this pill came in a package with details from the manufacturer? And you had a prescription from your doctor? Further, what if you could independently test the pill's chemical composition and make sure it matches the label and prescription? Or (flash forward to 2049), suppose you could verify that the chemical composition of the tablet is suitable for your DNA and confirmed by clinical studies.  Would that pill be more valuable to you? Undeniably. Its value increases depending on how much reliable information about it you have, even though the properties of the pill did not change.  Today, financial assets are too much like that loose pill on the counter. You don't know enough about where it's been, what's in it, or what it will do to you.  But the process we call tokenization is going to make many assets a lot more attractive to a lot more investors, in part by providing an unprecedented level of information.  Why crypto took off  Stepping back, let’s consider the legacy financial system. Quite apart from information asymmetry, there are other forms of friction that discourage investment.  Even though we tend to think the global financial markets are as liquid as possible, that is only actually true for people and organizations already in the ""system"" – i.e. brokers and financial institutions. The end client is forced to go through all the levels of hell in the form of know-your-customer (KYC) and compliance checks at each and every opening of an account, signing of contracts, paying of commissions, etc. This also applies to investments into growing enterprises, access to which is only granted to accredited investors.  Strict regulation of the market for end users has led to demand for alternatives, which has unexpectedly let off steam through the cryptocurrency market. As soon as people started to believe that this market let them not only enter, but also withdraw freely, liquidity surged, cryptocurrency grew by factors of 10, and the number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) rose by more than hundreds per month.  Despite the hype and inevitable disappointment in investing in totally unregulated assets (where the level of fraud constitutes 90 percent, according to the People's Bank of China), it is clear that the democratization of trade leads to a sharp increase in the attractiveness of assets. Every business or nation would, or should, like this to happen in its economy.  Barriers to exchange  As someone who, for a couple of years, was involved in the equities market, I can say red tape is the main reason why a client can change their mind about opening an account.  A secondary issue is by a low usability of trading software – it is necessary either to study up or to entrust the work to a third party.  More fundamental problems – such as the need for trust in intermediaries, poor infrastructure integration, and the speed of settlements – are in third place.  Indirectly, tokenization has created a fashion for extremely simple, convenient systems, where within 20 minutes you can get money on the exchange, trade, and withdraw capital. Of course, there is a risk that it will never be possible to withdraw money, but it is sometimes easier to accept such risk than the infinite dragging-on of undergoing compliance procedures.  The age of tokenization  One way or another, a term appeared in the blockchain space that had been coined, as it were, in the security management process. Balances of accounts on blockchains began to be called ""tokens,"" due to the fact that they were items to be simply and safely transmitted. In essence, tokenization is the process of transforming the storage and management of an asset, when each asset is assigned a digital counterpart.  Ideally, everything that happens in a digital accounting system should have legal implications, just as changes in a real estate register lead to a change in ownership of land. The age of tokenization introduces the important innovation that assets are managed directly by the owner instead of managing assets through issuing orders to a middleman.  The difference in approaches is easily explained by the example of the difference between the banking system and bitcoin. With a bank account, the client sends an instruction to a bank where it is executed by someone, and the client identifies themselves through their login and password. In the case of bitcoin, the transaction initiator uses their digital signature, which in itself is a sufficient condition for the transaction to be executed.  Nothing prevents the use of the same mechanism for traditional asset management. Certainly, this will require a change in infrastructure, but will bring many benefits. It will reduce costs, and increase the speed and security of trades.  Every trading infrastructure includes a depository, an exchange, a clearing house and client software. Tokenization assumes that all these components will be far more integrated. And blockchain technology will allow decentralizing the entire infrastructure, distributing the storage and processing functions between all the parties involved. This decentralization will make the system more resilient, since there will be no single point of failure; it will reduce the need for trust in a central provider; and it will allow instant audits, since multiple parties have real-time access to the ledger.  Unexpected results  In addition to the most obvious benefits from the transition to a digital domain – increased speed, security and convenience of operations, as well as less need for intermediaries – tokenization allows unexpected results.  Among them is the addition of properties of assets that are not initially inherent: the ability to prove the history of ownership, the opportunity to divide assets into the smallest fractions (bitcoin, for example, is divisible to the eighth decimal), and the ability to integrate principles of management into the asset itself. For example, suppose there are several partners in a real estate development who need to vote on a proposed renovation. With a wallet that holds their tokenized property, they can take the vote more efficiently, without having to meet face-to-face or trust a proxy to represent their wishes.  All these things will make a tokenized asset more valuable than a non-tokenized asset with the same fundamentals, just as easy access to reliable information about a pill would give you more confidence to take it.

42380055,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LmXP,1510465554,Confusion and Euphoria As Bitcoin Cash Tops $30 Billion,"""BITCOIN CASH IS BITCOIN NOW.""  Issued by Li Ang, head of China-based bitcoin mining outfit Canoe Pool, the proclamation may not be distinguishable from typical cryptocurrency banter. However, the difference this time around is the context.  No idle statement, Ang's comment comes amid what can only be characterized as one of the biggest migrations of capital yet seen in the nascent asset class. Billions are on the move in the crypto markets, and it's plainly observable where the funds are headed.  After hitting a record high above $800 on Friday, the price of bitcoin cash, the alternative cryptocurrency forked from the bitcoin blockchain in August, has doubled within 24 hours, hitting a high of $1,856 according to figures from data provider CoinMarketCap. At that price, bitcoin cash is now valued at more than $30 billion, passing ethereum for second-place standing in the market.  The move follows the sudden decision this week by a group of businesses and mining pools to suspend an effort to change the rules of the bitcoin software. Called Segwit2x, or simply ""2x"" by some, the effort would have increased bitcoin's block size – one way by which its transaction capacity can be measured.  But while bitcoin's developers and technologists lauded the suspension, miners and entrepreneurs lamented what they described to CoinDesk as a decision that would inspire others to migrate to blockchains more accommodating to their ideas and ideals. And if it was unclear at the time which alternatives would win favor, bitcoin cash is already proving the primary beneficiary.  Early and active in migrating support appears to be bitcoin's miners.  According to data from Fork.lol, at roughly 4:30 UTC on Sunday the total amount of mining power backing the bitcoin cash blockchain surpassed that of the bitcoin blockchain.  When asked about the move Jiang Zhuoer, founder of bitcoin mining pool BTC.Top, said simply that ""2x fans"" are moving both funds and mining hardware to bitcoin cash.  ""BTC is going to die,"" Zhuoer said. Hapio Yang, CEO of mining pool operator ViaBTC, responded similarly, indicating he believes that businesses and investors are now migrating funds to bitcoin cash.  ""I think more and more bitcoin holders are starting to understand what is the real bitcoin,"" he said via WeChat.  Doom sellers  Indeed, spurred by a sudden change in market outlook, bitcoin cash supporters appeared emboldened in their remarks. No doubt part of the equation is the soaring valuation of the protocol, which after debuting at $4 billion in August, hasn't exactly solve some of its more pressing open questions.  Still, Jake Smith, general manager of cryptocurrency web portal Bitcoin.com, owned by investor and block size increase advocate Roger Ver, doubled down on the idea that the new investment dollars represent more than a speculative migration in the market soon to pass.  Smith noted that with the price boost bitcoin cash's value proposition can only now be strengthened by what he categorized as its ultimate performance increases over the bitcoin blockchain.  ""I think a positive feedback loop has been created. This is waking people up to the shaky foundations BTC is built on,"" he said.  Smith went so far as to describe the typical doomsday situation predicted by those supporting larger blocks – that bitcoin's transaction backlog will continue to grow, its transactions will become more expensive, and that these two factors will decrease user experience and force users to migrate.  Other supporters like bitcoin cash developer Juan Garavaglia chalked up the day's price movements to ""better planning"" by those using the protocol.  ""Bitcoin Core is unable to execute, has a poor roadmap [and is] disconnected with market needs,"" Garavaglia said. ""We can execute, we have smooth coordination with key market actors and we address market needs.""  Skeptical voices  If those boasts sound familiar, so too was the rhetoric from those who were more apt to read the bitcoin cash price movements with more incredulity.  Jack Liao, the CEO of Hong Kong-based mining firm LightningASIC, for instance, sought to frame the idea that the bitcoin cash price increase represented any real uptick in interest in the project as ""total bullshit.""  One of the leaders behind the bitcoin gold cryptocurrency, set to launch tomorrow, Liao has been a noted critic of bitcoin's mining operators, in particular, Bitmain – one of the industry's largest sellers of specialized mining chips and the operator of several mining pools.  For those following the scaling debate, Bitmain's conduct has been one of the larger contentious narrative points, and Liao (like others) believes the explosion seen in the bitcoin cash market value is nothing more than an orchestrated bid by the firm (and its supporters) to prop up the market.  ""Many, many investors just see the change in hash rate,"" he said. ""But they cannot support such a big bitcoin cash price.""  Beijing-based over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong reported a similar sentiment in some circles, crediting the price to manipulation by miners and investors who have supported Segwit2x and bitcoin cash in the past. Bitmain and Ver were both signatories of the agreement that sparked the 2x software.  ""They have money, they have hash power, they have everything need to pump the bitcoin cash price,"" he said.  Indeed, one of the more interesting theories at the moment revolves around an unconfirmed PasteBin conversation that seems to foretell yesterday's market move (though this may say more about current paranoia in the industry at large).  Swing states  Still, that's not to say the reaction was broken along partisan lines.  Willy Woo, recently named one of CoinDesk's Top 5 Token Analysts of 2017, sees the price move as perhaps one to watch. In contrast to other alternative cryptocurrencies that he said may lack value propositions, he went so far as to color bitcoin cash as a more nuanced option.  ""It's backed by a lot of money from China controlling its price and supporting its network. If you buy bitcoin cash, you are betting that China wants it to dominate. That's a strategic and geopolitical bet,"" he told CoinDesk.  Bobby Lee, CEO of mining pool and exchange operator BTCC, had a similar reaction. Long a business that supported the Segwit2x proposal to upgrade the blockchain, he reads the price boost in bitcoin cash as an obvious side effect of the decision to block the upgrade.  While he acknowledged that it's yet to be seen whether this weekend's movements amount to anything more than a quick speculative fervor, he still hinted the situation remains one he'll be watching and observing.  Of particular concern for Lee, and others, is the decline in bitcoin's total mining power.  Lee went so far as to suggest that any continuing decline in this metric could cut into an attribute that has traditionally been one of the cryptocurrency's defining characteristics.  Lee concluded:  ""If BTC's hash power continues to fall, then I do think BTC has long-term trouble.""
