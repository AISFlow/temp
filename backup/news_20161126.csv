This article covers 19th to 26th November.  Bitcoin continued to trade at elevated levels this week, repeatedly breaking past $750 and coming within reach of annual highs.  Having traded above $700 since 14th November as strong market sentiment fueled demand, bitcoin prices reached nearly $755 during the week, according to CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures.  While this appreciation allowed the digital currency’s price to come within $30 of the annual high of $781.31 reached in mid-June, bitcoin prices soon fell to as little as $713.13.  Amid declines like these, many market participants have put themselves into position to ""buy the dip,"" said Petar Zivkovski, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.  ""A relatively high amount of new money is coming into the system"" to fuel this speculation, Zivkovski told CoinDesk, adding:  ""This has resulted however in a very high volume of long positions with a high average entry price above $730.""  Rising enthusiasm  Joe Lee, founder of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Magnr, also spoke to the rising enthusiasm surrounding bitcoin.  In addition to bitcoin's near annual highs this week, prices will enjoy their longest stretch above $500 – as long as they remain north of this key level through the end of November, Lee said.  Many market observers have pointed out the important relationship between macroeconomic events and bitcoin prices.  Lee, for example, stated that Magnr’s data supports the idea that there is a very strong correlation between these prices and factors like the US election or changes in Chinese monetary policy.  In recent months, market observers have repeatedly pointed to Chinese capital controls as helping push bitcoin prices higher. If the nation’s monetary policies cause the USD/CNH exchange rate to fall below 7.00, the bitcoin price will break out of its current trading range, BitMEX co-founder and CEO Arthur Hayes told CoinDesk.  Zivkovski also spoke to the importance of macro events, emphasizing that while long positions have piled up, these speculative wagers could potentially trigger a long squeeze, driving prices lower.  ""For price to keep going up, there would need to be a macro-catalyst such as wide-scale adoption of SegWit,"" he said. ""Market dynamics alone indicate that profit-taking is more likely.""  ETH/ETC still falling  While bitcoin prices may need macroeconomic events to rise in value, both ether (ETH) and ether classic (ETC) suffered price declines this week amid continued technical challenges.  Though the former declined 8% week-over-week, the latter fell 15.5%, Poloniex figures reveal.  Ethereum underwent its fourth hard fork, ""Spurious Dragon"", on 22nd November. This latest change in the ethereum protocol empowered developers to delete accounts that had been left all over the network by an unidentified hacker.  Spurious Dragon is ethereum’s third hard fork in four months. While that fact in and of itself may not do much to inspire confidence in the platform's underlying technology, Spurious Dragon ran into a snag on 24th November.  Jacob Eliosoff, cryptocurrency fund manager, explained the situation, saying: “""Neither of the two main clients (Geth and Parity) had implemented the fork's intended logic correctly,"" and both clients became ""buggy"" in different ways.  ""This resulted in a mini-fork of the chain, now reunited, but, from what I've seen, not in a very reassuring way,"" he told CoinDesk.  Eliosoff emphasized that, on one hand, this whole situation revealed ""more amateurism, more cause for caution and investor pullback"".  “On the other hand,"" he added, ""the price hasn't dropped much considering (net ~3%, after bouncing back from a quick plunge), which suggests a decent buffer of opportunistic buyers.""  Classic comes into its own  While ethereum encountered some challenges this week, ethereum classic worked to further define its identity.  Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, commented on the situation.  ""It appears to me that ethereum classic is gravitating towards bitcoin-esque attributes, like immutability at all costs and capped supply,"" he told CoinDesk. ""While I understand the inherent value of these attributes, it positions ethereum classic as more of a competitor with bitcoin, which is an awkward place to be.""  Zivkovkski described ETC as “the ‘anti-establishment’, fully decentralized version of ETH”, stating that it has “managed to carve a niche in an already crowded market”.

42378995,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkMr,1480171510,Ledger Launches Hardware Wallet for the Smart Contract Era,"Ledger, the French company known for its range of bitcoin hardware wallets, has launched a new extension of its product line: the Ledger Blue.  Billed as ""the most advanced hardware wallet on the market today"", the Ledger Blue is a significant departure from the thumbdrive style of Ledger's previous products. With a 320 x 480 pixel screen (along with BlueTooth and near-field communication (NFC) capability), it's a handheld touchscreen device that can run a number of different applications.  In a video call, Ledger CEO Eric Larchevêque talked to CoinDesk about the product’s evolution, design philosophy and target market.  Support for smart contracts  Ledger launched its first product, the Ledger Nano, in December 2014, marketed at the time as a small, secure and low-cost hardware wallet.  Then, earlier this year, the Nano S was released – a line extension that included both a small LED screen and support for other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and litecoin. (Ultimately, it was hailed as a more affordable competitor to the popular Trezor wallet).  The launch of the Blue now comes as as a response to the increasingly complex needs of an ecosystem that now includes smart contracts, token exchanges and other types of asset trading – creating a situation where transactions and contracts can involve multiple parties and variables, each of which the signatory needs to verify.  “Say you want to develop smart contracts on ethereum, at the moment it's hard to validate everything on a small screen,” said Larchevêque. “But the Ledger Blue allows you to build your own application to validate a specific smart contract.""  The amount of screen real estate means that an application can present multiple data fields for inspection before the final confirmation is given, an essential step when a contract will then automatically execute itself.  ""With the blockchain, so much of the security relies on the endpoint – that's why it's really important to know that what you see is what you sign,"" Larchevêque said.  The Blue also includes support for a range of cryptocurrencies: the device’s technical spec currently lists bitcoin, ethereum, Zcash, Dash and Monero, along with the ability to integrate with other wallet providers like Electrum and Mycelium.  According to Ledger’s description of its custom-built Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System, these different currency handling applications are run in isolation from each other and cannot access memory or storage used by another, meaning that cryptographic secrets should remain safe even if one application is compromised.  Tech-savvy targeted  The Ledger Blue is also built with open-source principles in mind both for software and hardware design.  Whereas most smart devices ship with completely sealed enclosures, the Blue's case is held in place magnetically and can be detached.  In a video demonstration, Larchevêque showed the case quickly separating and reattaching to reveal the components inside, a design choice which reflects the assumption that this is a product geared toward technically skilled end users.  ""We already know that crypto asset enthusiasts want to have a powerful, best-in-class hardware wallet. But the new customers we want to reach with this product are enterprise customers … who are already starting to build solutions on the blockchain using our products,"" Larchevêque said.  Some enterprise clients that have already signed up include Monax and Stratumn, two enterprise blockchain platforms which will use the Blue as a hardware endpoint for their services.  With its enterprise SDK included with the product, Ledger is also hoping to attract developers to the platform.  The product, priced at €229 before VAT, is decidedly high-end, but looks to offer a vastly different user experience to anything currently on the market. Once the first units reach consumers, we'll no doubt be hearing a range of feedback on how it compares.  The Ledger Blue is available for pre-order today, with devices expected to ship by December 18th. Customers can get 20% off for Black Friday weekend only with promo code BBF21.
