42377626,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VSh,1410822063,Bitfinex Launches Tradable Bitcoin Mining Contracts,"Bitfinex has entered the bitcoin mining space with the introduction of a new tradable asset tied to hashing power.  The Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange will offer the asset, which it says will be sold in a live beta tranche. The asset, dubbed TH1, represents hashing power in a pool that produces approximately 3,500 Th/s in mining power, according to its announcementhttps://www.bitfinex.com/pages/announcements.  The approach is similar to the way hashing power is sold on exchanges like CEX.io, but differs from other types of contract mining in which customers pay for an amount of hashes over the course of an established period of time.  Bitfinex  said in a statement that it actively sought a different approach to offering mining power, but emphasized that the initiative could change as future tranches are rolled out, noting:  “We have worked for some time to develop what we believe is a superior approach to ‘cloud mining’ that is smartly packaged to offer simplicity and transparency.""  The exchange indicated that, while excited about the offering, it expects to improve the product during its beta stage. The beta will last three months and feature a total tranche size of 100 terahashes, the price of which includes maintenance fees.  Tradable commodity  By creating an asset, Bitfinex joins other exchanges in seeking to turn hashing power into a tradable commodity that can appeal to more investors. In the case of Bitfinex, exchange members will also have the opportunity to borrow and margin trade TH1.  Rewards for TH1 ownership will be based on the time of purchase in relation to the time that blocks are discovered and paid out, the company said.  Bitfinex explained:  “The block chain time stamp on block rewards will be used to determine 'holders of record' at the time that the block was mined. Positions will be aggregated between balances in the Exchange Wallet and trading position in the trading wallet to determine a ‘net position’.”  Bitfinex went on to say that “dividends will be computed as the pro rata share of the block reward less the pool fee”, and those who borrowed or margin traded TH1 will receive dividends as well.  In addition to its latest product, Bitfinex offers three accounts, its basic exchange wallet, deposit wallets that allow users to provide liquidity to traders and trading wallets for leveraged trading.  Advanced bitcoin finance  Assets that generate BTC returns aren't new to the bitcoin exchange marketplace.  China-based bitcoin exchange Huobi recently closed the sale of a fixed-return investment asset. Like similar products offered on the market, these returns are tied to the rewards of a mining operation owned by Huobi. Demand for Huobi's fixed-return asset was strong, with the company reporting that the tranche had sold out within two hours of initial offering.  Offerings like Huobi's and the Bitfinex mining asset point to the continued development of advanced bitcoin-denominated financial instruments.  Yet, the growth in advanced trading options has come at a cost, some say. Recent fluctuations in the price of bitcoin have been connected to these activities, although the platforms that offer margin trading say that it is an important part of the ecosystem that could help lead to long-term stability.

42377616,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VHN,1410809400,"Plan to Launch 1,000 US Bitcoin ATMs Collapses Amid Alleged Misconduct","A previously announced business partnership between BitXatm and CryptVision that would have resulted in the launch of 1,000 bitcoin ATMs in the US has been dissolved.  First revealed on 20th July, the deal made CryptVision the exclusive provider of BitXatm bitcoin ATMs in the US and Canada. At the time, Los Angeles-based CryptVision aimed to establish itself as one of the more prominent bitcoin ATM operators in North America, while Germany-based BitXatm aimed to further its presence outside of Europe.  The news was first detailed in an 8th September blog post published by BitXatm that announced it would withdraw from the partnership, effective immediately, alleging that CryptVision ""never conducted any organized effort to secure new customers as stipulated by the agreement"".  BitXatm wrote:  ""Refusal of CryptVision’s management to act in good faith and respect legal obligations arising from our partnership agreement left BitXatm with no choice but to terminate the collaboration and remove any right of representation from CryptVision.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, CryptVision president Sergey Yesayan was equally critical of the actions of his company's former partner.  ""We have been deeply disappointed with BitX[atm]’s behavior and its demonstrated unwillingness to deal ethically with CryptVision,"" he said.  CryptVision confirmed that it is still seeking to launch a fleet of bitcoin ATMs in North America, while BitXatm has pledged to announce further expansion plans in what it has called a key international market.  Moving past the partnership  Representatives from both parties suggested that, while the split was not amicable, neither intends to pursue legal action.  Catalin Tincu, co-founder of BitXatm, told CoinDesk:  ""Our intention is to put behind this unfortunate event, to take care of our customers and prospects in US. We are not here to tarnish CryptVision reputation, we just present 'the ugly truth' and is not our fault that CryptVision put themselves in such position.""  Tincu went on to claim that while it has ""strong evidence of [CryptVision's] lack of honesty and business ethics"", it is not willing to make the information public at this time. BitXatm has asked potential business partners that may have been in touch with CryptVision to contact it directly.  CryptVision is represented by Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman attorney Marco Santori, who recently joined Blockchain as its global policy council. Santori declined to comment on the partnership or BitXatm's statements, but indicated CryptVision is excited to move on to upcoming business.  Announcements upcoming  Both companies indicated their willingness to move on with their larger plans, albeit independently.  For its part, Yesayan indicated that CryptVision intends to rebrand its company; that it is considering building its own proprietary bitcoin ATMs and expects to have forthcoming announcements. Yesayan claimed the rebranding was necessary, citing a dissatisfaction with how the name may reflect its larger goals. CryptVision's former website is no longer active.  In turn, Tincu told CoinDesk that he is optimistic that BitXatm will be able to move forward with its formal plans for entering the US market, adding:  ""We were contacted by few companies from US interested in taking over what supposed to be CryptVision's part in this partnership, and is very possible for us to conclude this new partnership in upcoming weeks.""

42377627,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VWT,1410802510,Bitcoin Compliance Solutions Startup Vogogo Goes Public,"Vogogo is now trading as a public company on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) under the ticker symbol 'VGO'.  Operated by TMX Group, a Canadian financial services company that oversees the Toronto Stock Exchange among other properties, the TSXV specializes in hosting small-cap stocks and provides early-stage companies the ability to raise funds from the capital markets.  Geoff Gordon, CEO of Vogogo – a Calgary-based payment processing, risk management and regulatory compliance platform – framed the move as a strategic decision that will provide the company with additional access to capital and the ability to execute acquisitions.  Gordon added:  ""More importantly, it helps as far as our reputation with banking partners, our ability to secure new banking partners, our ability to provide a sense of comfort to regulators, which to us is all very important stuff when you want to make a big move in the crypto space.""  The move follows the company's $8.5m funding round in August, and comes as Vogogo is looking to extend its compliance solution to digital currency startups.  Vogogo provides a solution that automates payment processing, regulatory compliance and risk management for cryptocurrency businesses, removing the need for them to build in-house systems.  Reaching out to investors  Apart from providing validation for Vogogo, the stock offering will also provide Canada's retail investors with new exposure to the digital currency industry.  Gordon said:  ""I think there are a lot of people who would like to speculate on bitcoin and altcoins and cryptocoins in general, but they're looking for perhaps an interim way to do that. We're very much a great option in that regard.""  Although the news marks the introduction of Vogogo to the Canadian stock market, legally the move reinstates the trading of shares on behalf of its previous legal entities. Earlier this May, Southtech Capital Corporation and Redfall Technologies amalgamated to form a new corporate entity, a move that formally dissolved both Southtech and Redfall.  Vogogo was originally a product introduced by Redfall Technologies in 2012, while Southtech Capital Corporation was a capital pool company.  Crypto goes public  With its arrival on the TSXV, Vogogo also becomes the latest bitcoin industry company to pursue access to the capital markets and the wider investing public.  Although Gordon indicated he is confident in the decision, other prominent public bitcoin companies have struggled in recent months to hold investor interest.  Bitcoin Shop, which is publicly traded on the OTCQB market, for example, has seen its stock decline from a February high of $5.26 to a press time level of $0.10. Bitcoin Shop's executive team agreed last week to forgo their salaries for the next six months in light of the stock's recent performance.  Although primarily focused on the cryptocurrency space, Vogogo also notably serves businesses in the traditional e-commerce space.  Vogogo joins Vancouver-based bitcoin product and service provider Newnote Financial Corp, which is traded on the Canadian Securities Exchange, as the latest Canadian digital currency company to list its shares on a major domestic exchange.

42377621,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VOv,1410797449,Andreas Antonopoulos Joins E-Commerce Company CoinSimple,"Bitcoin security expert Andreas Antonopoulos has joined e-commerce company CoinSimple as an advisor.  The Hong Kong-based platform enables customers to choose how they process their digital currency payments. They can use BitPay, Coinbase, GoCoin or do it themselves via Armory and Electrum wallets.  This isn't the first time Antonopoulos has worked with the company, CoinSimple confirmed in a statement:  “Andreas has been involved in various roles with CoinSimple since the company’s formation and his role as an advisor will allow him to help shape CoinSimple’s future and core product.""  SaaS beta  CoinSimple argues it can provide the best bitcoin price for its customers, as they can use multiple payment processors simultaneously and shop around for the best offer at any given time.  The platform can also accept more than one cryptocurrency depending on the choice of payment processor and customers can switch between processors automatically if one goes out of action.  CoinSimple  is launching its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product at the Inside Bitcoins conference in London today. The company said additional plugins for e-commerce store functionality will be released at a later date.  Antonopoulos said he is confident in CoinSimple’s platform:  “CoinSimple’s commitment to decentralized solutions for payment processing, including the Do-It-Yourself solution that CoinSimple offers, as well as the strength and the proven execution record of the team, give me the confidence that CoinSimple will bring more consultants and e-commerce merchants to the bitcoin ecosystem.”  Last year, CoinSimple's potential was also recognised by seed-stage funding outfit Seedcoin when the incubator invested 200 BTC in the company during its SF1 round.  Multiple advisor roles  Earlier this month, Antonopoulos announced he was leaving the post of chief security officer at bitcoin wallet and information services company Blockchain. He is now an advisor to the company's board.  In recent years Antonopoulos has advised several bitcoin startups, lectured on cryptocurrencies and published more than two hundred articles on security, cryptography, cloud computing, data centres and a range of other topics.  He currently works at RootEleven, a technology incubator he founded in January 2013, which focuses on cryptocurrencies.

42377630,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VXj,1410786560,United Way Becomes Largest Nonprofit to Accept Bitcoin,"Nonprofit United Way Worldwide announced today that it now accepts donations in bitcoin, becoming the latest charitable institution to adopt the digital currency into its operations.  The US-based organisation claims to be the largest privately held nonprofit in the world, raising more than $5bn annually with more than 2.8 million volunteers, 9.7 million donors and community initiatives, and partnerships with such companies and organisations as the National Football League (NFL), Exxon Mobile, and General Electric.  The move signifies the further alignment of the charity with its mission to mobilize its activity in improving education, helping people achieve financial stability and promoting better health.  Donations made in bitcoin will support United Way’s Innovation Fund, which aims to help change the social sector with projects focused on technology, relationships and efficiency to power the group’s worldwide movement.  The integration of bitcoin is made possible by using merchant tools provided by Coinbase and comes just weeks after the payment processor announced that it has waived all exchange fees for registered 501(c) non-profit organizations.  Bringing potential donors  With at least one million users and 36,000 merchants across the world, Coinbase brings the potential for new donors to United Way: those who may not have donated to the organisation in the past, but are incentivised by the ease of paying with bitcoin.  Moreover, the company makes it economically feasible to send smaller amounts and micro-donations – amounts of $1 or less – since it does not charge transaction fees.  To make a donation in digital currency, users are directed to the organisation's website, where they are provided with a bitcoin address to which funds should be sent.  Additionally, Coinbase customers are given the option to complete the payment from their account. There is a 10-minute window during which the payment should be completed.  Philanthropic goals in the bitcoin community  Despite the chatter among the bitcoin community that it has not delivered on its potential for doing good, bitcoin-powered philanthropic activity has increased significantly this year alone.  Small groups like Sean’s Outpost, the Women’s Annex Foundation and some open-souce software organisations accept bitcoin alongside other cryptocurrencies.  Over the summer, Wikipedia started accepting bitcoin donations, becoming one of the first major non-profits to adopt bitcoin, while BitGive recently became the first IRS tax exempt bitcoin charity.  Now United Way has entered the cryptocurrency arena, and while it may not be the first organisation to seek charitable donations in bitcoin, it is almost certainly the largest.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/15/united-way-becomes-largest-nonprofit-to-accept-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be41ee6d199870a0a1dd2485622ac8b60cebc829-1300x1077.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377628,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72VVD,1410784629,Silk Road 2.0 Hit by 'Sophisticated' DDoS Attack,"Online black market Silk Road 2.0 experienced a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack last week, which forced the site’s administrators to temporarily suspend services.  News of the attack broke on bitcoin forums hours after it started, with the Silk Road team soon confirming the news via its own forums.  For reasons that are less clear, black market Agora has faced outage issues problems of its own in the last few days.  Silk Road remains defiant  Silk Road 2.0 moderator 'Defcon' issued a statement saying that the site was facing a “very sophisticated” DDoS attack using the most advanced methods the site has experienced to date.  The moderator said:  “The dev team is working around the clock to get marketplace service restored, as well as watch the security of our systems closely. Much of the downtime you have seen is intentional on our part: if this is an attempt to locate our servers through packet analysis, we do not want to make it easy for our adversary and would rather be offline while we adapt our defences.”  As the attack continued, Silk Road 2.0 remained offline.  Defcon eventually issued a second update, indicating that the team is trying out different approaches to blocking the inbound DDoS. He stressed that the site is still processing withdrawals, although these have been delayed by the attacks. Silk Road 2.0 is aware that cashflow is very important and the site is therefore prioritising delayed withdrawals, the moderator added.  Defcon ended the update on a defiant note:  “To our adversaries: you cannot stop us. We will overcome every attack.”  Questions persist  Silk Road 2.0 vendors started reporting problems earlier last week, before the site was finally forced to shut down. Despite official updates, the outage prompted a number vendors to raise questions about the impact of the attack.  Silk Road 2.0 was targeted by hackers in the past: last February, the site lost 4,476 BTC to an alleged hack, worth over $2.6m at the time. The attack was blamed on a transaction malleability exploit used by one of the vendors.  The site decided to compensate affected customers and, by late May, it said more than 80% of bitcoins stolen in the alleged heist have been repaid to the victims.  The source and goal of the latest attack remains unclear. Speculation is mounting that the attack was in fact launched by law enforcement in an attempt to ascertain the location of Silk Road 2.0 servers, while other users believe the attack was launched by criminals or competitors.  Following the February hack, Silk Road 2.0 said it would introduce a multi-signature wallet system to replace its previous escrow platform. A multisig system should be less vulnerable to hackers, but has not been fully implemented yet.  Online black market Agora faces outage  Silk Road 2.0 is not the only black market suffering outage issues. While Silk Road 2.0 was struggling to restore services, which it eventually did late on Friday, competing market Agora went offline.  Agora users started reporting intermittent problems on Saturday. The site was out of action over much of the weekend and had still not become available by press time (12:15 BST, Monday).  The reason for the outage remains unclear. Earlier this month, Agora confirmed that it was suffering from availability issues on a regular basis. However, the team offered an extensive explanation into the inner workings of the market and the need for security, saying it considers that more important than around-the-clock availability.  The Agora team said at the time:  ""Our primary goal is to stay hidden from law enforcement agencies and secure from hackers. We implement much more security measures than many others, which causes problems with availability.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/15/silk-road-20-hit-by-sophisticated-ddos-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/736f0c3999d2c5a55eb16e800d6c481b725761c3-1250x834.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
