42376634,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTqF,1381501835,"Remote control, rank craziness and revolution 2.0","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 11th October 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  Bike helmets and bitcoin, the new tools of global shopping  John Law is gratified that bitcoin real life is following art so closely. Following his mention last week that in the ever-running battles between government and substances, King Charles II had tried to ban coffee because it encouraged sedition, we now discover that coffee is back on the menu.  Only this time, it's not a matter of bitcoin being used to evade the long arm of the law, but the equally long tentacles of commercial interests. The Roast Station Project is basically one man, a laptop and a group of local growers in Bali.  You send The Java Nomad your BTC, he sends you your Joe directly, and takes care of converting his stash into acceptable currency for his suppliers. He's embedded with the farmers, so there's no middlemen except him and the postal service.  This is a good fit for a number of reasons. Bitcoin commerce just needs a laptop. The Java Nomad gets to live in Bali and, presumably, wears flip-flops to the office. And, since the tech world consumes a lake of coffee the size of the Baltic every day, the marketing takes care of itself.  It won't have the established commercial coffee companies crying into their Georgian silver, but big changes come from small starts.  The obvious question is: what else can do this? Last week was beef, this week coffee, but it probably won't scale to cars and houses.  Yet think about clothes, electronics, antiques, craft goods. They don't seem to work – it's true that there are some superb markets in far-away places with tons of interesting, affordable and otherwise unobtainable goodies, but the effort in creating and updating catalogues, prices and all the other things for a good online shopping experience – well, you'd need a big team paid in local currency and with all the big company legal and practical overheads.  Hold hard. The Australians have the answer. This week saw the launch – for, it has to be admitted, tourist marketing purposes – of Remote Control Tourists.  These are jolly Melbourne types equipped with head-mounted webcams and microphones: the idea is you sit at home, Skype into their mobile systems, and let them show you the sights, do a bit of exploration for you and generally act as your meat puppets on the other side of the world. (Then you book a holiday – or so the tourist board hopes.)  All it would take to turn them into personal shoppers is a bitcoin wallet. Say you live in North London and want to buy some crazy electronic gizmos from the table markets in Shenzhen – or you live in Shenzhen and fancy the latest street fashions from Camden Market.  Sure, you can bash away at an infinite number of online shops, try and guess whether what you want is what you see, and do it the old fashioned way. Or you order up a Remote Control Shopper and go for a virtual wander in the real world.  You can check stuff out, talk to the locals, get real-time tips on bargains and rip-offs, and then just shove the requisite cybercoinage over the Internet. Job done – and anyone can set themselves up to provide this service with, basically, a smartphone strapped to a bike helmet.  All the pieces are in place for a major worldwide retail revolution. Just remember where you read it first.  Dinosaur Jr.  Worldwide revolutions are not universally popular, but as revolutionaries tend to be smaller, smarter and faster than the things they're pulling apart, the fight back against them can be entertainingly ham-fisted.  Digital d'oh of the week belongs, without a doubt, to Capital One. It's fine for banks to not like bitcoin – if they don't want the business, someone else will – and it's no surprise when they quote real (or imaginary) legal and regulatory issues to justify their unwillingness to have anything to do with cybercurrencies. It's pretty much at the limit of corporate imagination, but they don't keep flocks of highly-trained leathery-winged lawyers roosting in tall offices for nothing.  So, yeah, if you don't want the business of anyone trading bitcoins, Capital One, then that's your shout.  But here's a free clue to help you not look like an utter dolt while doing it: bitcoins are not real coins. They do not come in round metal form with In Turing We Trust stamped around the edges and a jolly BTC symbol on the obverse. If you find one of these, then it's not a bitcoin. It's a medallion. Real bitcoins are – there's a clue in the name – bits. They are digital. Round lumps of metal – yes, even the ones with a QR-code on them – are not bitcoins.  Now, you might think the ability to identify different sorts of money would be a core competency for financial operatives. OK, one can kind of understand that banks didn't manage to work out that sub-prime bundled insurance derivatives weren't real money, even though they invented them, because nobody understood those. But, y'know, coins. Been around for a few thousand years. Surely...  No. As Rob Grey, CEO of Mulligan Mint found out when Capital One closed down his account with no warning.  His crime? He made novelty bitcoin-themed medallions. Not ones you can buy with bitcoin either – he just takes his money the old way. You know. Credit cards. Or he did, until Capital One's sclerotic system identified him as a bitcoin trader and – wham. He's off to PayPal while he sorts out the mess.  At least, that's what everyone thinks happened. Capital One, with the dull perceptions of a stegosaurus falling into a swamp, may or may not have started to realise that something is wrong somewhere. It has not, at the time of writing, managed any sort of reaction. Not even a rustling from the lawyer coop.  So, John Law recommends that as Capital One can't tell novelty medallions from actual money, you pop out, scoop up a few of those delicious gold-foil-wrapped chocolate coin treats from your local sweetie merchant, and pay them in at once.  Just don't call them bitecoins.  This is where the real magic happens  The Silk Road shakedown continues to make sparks fly.  Four 'significant' Silk Road users have been nabbed in Britain, with the UK's Naughtiness Catching Agency (NCA) promising that plenty more will follow.  The FBI has been shown no respect, with its own bitcoin wallet (hope they don't bank with Capital One) coming under sustained payment graffiti, while complaining that since Dread Pirate Roberts kept most of his BTC in an encrypted wallet they can't get at them.  Meanwhile, the community is busy thinking about making Silk Road replacements that are much stronger against attacks, which should surprise nobody (Capital One excepted; it surprises easily).  But one thing that Silk Road did demonstrate is that complexity breeds insecurity: it wasn't the basic idea that was vulnerable to the feds, it was trying to tie up all the loose ends that burned the house down. Which is why it's good to report the week's most significant yet easily overlooked event: the imminence of a new bitcoin payment protocol.  You can and should go and read up on that; it might seem like a dry recitation of cryptographic techniques, but this is the engine-room of the whole enterprise.  The key point is that it's going to get a lot easier and safer for ordinary people to send and receive bitcoins over the Internet.  We'll all be able to be much surer that we're dealing with someone who is who they say they are, get our money back if things go wrong, and be sure that a transaction's gone through properly. It'll be far easier to exchange bitcoin wallet addresses, too.  Ordinary people have most of the money – at least, the sort that you and John Law and the rest of the non super-rich are likely to use. Turning it into bitcoin and spreading the love around is still too hard and weird for most, and that has to be fixed pronto if the idea will spread.  You may remember that one day in the 1990s, ordinary personal computers suddenly learned to speak Internet. Before that, it was the provenance of speccy nerds and wild-eyed techno-hippies: after that, even your parents had email addresses with which to complain that their Windows 95 was playing up and could you pop over and fix it please.  That has to happen for bitcoin. With the new payment protocols, the groundwork is being done to make it so. Of course, it may not – lots of things could and will happen between now and then – but then nobody really expected the Internet of 2013 would ever happen.  Note to Capital One: it has.

42376632,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTcP,1381484426,The first Polish businesses to accept bitcoins,"The number of companies accepting payment for services and goods in bitcoins is steadily rising in Poland. Although still relatively few, these businesses are paving the way for the increased local use of the digital currency.  Meanwhile, Polish state institutions are yet to present a coherent stance on the digital currencies and their role in local financial transactions.  Social media agency faceADDICTED is one of the latest companies to join the ranks of bitcoin proponents in Poland.  Based in the country’s capital city Warsaw, the agency decided to reinforce its online presence by starting to accept bitcoin payments from its clients in May 2013.  faceADDICTED’s diversified brand portfolio in the Polish market includes major players from various industries, such as Coca-Cola, Starbucks Coffee, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Bosch, Ecco and Comedy Central.  Two months later, another local business with a primarily online presence, web design company El Passion, started accepting bitcoins.  The Polish business says it chiefly specializes in information architecture and user interface design for web and mobile applications. El Passion said in a statement on its website:  ""We are strong supporters of the cryptocurrency. There are plenty of reasons to use bitcoin – ease of use, free and nearly instant international transfers, no need for currency exchange and security – just to name a few.”  In addition to this, the web design company says it is also making efforts to promote and foster the wider use of bitcoins in the Polish economy.  To achieve this goal, El Passion is actively engaged in the activities of the Warsaw Bitcoin Meetup Group and is co-organizing meetings and discussions which are open to all willing to participate and discuss the future on the digital currency.  The first of such parties was held in early August at Parking Bar, a trendy spot in downtown Warsaw, which became another place to accept payments in bitcoins.  Meanwhile, with the ranks of local businesses now accepting payments in the digital currency growing, the Polish Ministry of Finance has drafted a policy document which says that, under Polish law, bitcoins cannot be considered a currency. In spite of this, transactions made in bitcoins are nevertheless subject to taxation, according to the ministry.  The policy document, signed by Poland’s Deputy Minister of Finance Wojciech Kowalczyk and released in July 2013, outlines the ministry’s stance on the use of bitcoins in financial transactions carried out in Poland.  The ministry says that, given that bitcoins are currently not universally treated as a currency by Poles, all transactions made in bitcoins are a result of two parties agreeing contractually to use the digital currency in settling their dealings.  This said, the ministry states in the document that ""the rising popularity of the bitcoin in the years 2009-2011 has caused increased interest by various public institutions in this phenomena in Poland, Europe and the world.”  The ministry also admits that the question of the legal status of digital currencies is currently debated not only in Poland, but also in numerous member states of the European Union.  ""It is worth noting that the functioning of digital currencies, including bitcoin, has a global character. As a result, the Ministry of Finance believes that all eventual actions related to digital currencies should be taken at international level, in particular at the European Union level,” the document says.  According to the finance ministry, the state’s absence from the bitcoin market can be considered a negative factor impacting the digital currency’s users in Poland. The policy document says:  ""In the current legal framework, digital currency trading is not subject to control exerted by any [public] institution, and as such, its functioning can create certain risks [for the parties].”  Despite the lack of official recognition of the country’s bitcoin market by Polish state authorities, there are already digital platforms which allow Poles to trade digital currencies.  In its document, the Ministry of Finance refers to one of such platforms, pln.bitcurex.com. Established in 2012, the website is operated by local firm Digital Future, headquartered in the city of Łódź, Poland.  With bitcoin trading becoming increasingly popular in Poland, some established foreign-based platforms are expanding their operations to the local market with Polish-language versions of their websites.  Mt.Gox is already present here with services tailored to the needs of Poland-based customers. In late 2011, the Tokyo-based business acquired local website Bitomat.pl and migrated its users’ accounts into its system, thus becoming a major local player.  Meanwhile, as the digital currency market continues to expand in Poland, local non-governmental organizations are also beginning to appreciate the digital currency in a bid to garner increased funds for their operations.  The local branch of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, a free market think-tank, is very likely the first Poland-based non-profit to start accepting donations in bitcoins.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jaroslaw Adamowski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/11/the-first-polish-businesses-to-accept-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdb328d44dab1da18976952db8ac41d87803c557-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
