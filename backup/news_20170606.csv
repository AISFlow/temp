New filings  from the US Securities and Exchange Commission reveal that Enneking is launching the ""Crypto Asset Fund"", registered in the state of Delaware. CNBC first reported the news.  According to that filing, no equity sales in the fund have been made. The minimum amount required by outside investors to gain a stake is $5,000, the filing notes.  Enneking told CNBC that the fund will be aimed at investing in a broader subset of digital currencies and blockchain assets. He also said that, as it stands, he has been fielding interest from institutional investors looking to gain a stake in the market.

42427615,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWc1h,1496770321,AT&T Awarded Patent for Bitcoin-Powered Subscriber Server,"US telecom giant AT&T has been awarded a patent for a kind of home subscriber server backed by blockchain tech.  A home subscriber server performs authentication and media delivery functions for subscription holders. AT&T’s patent, as reported last year by CoinDesk, was aimed at improving the resiliency of these systems by creating a distributed network of nodes that share information.  AT&T first filed its patent application in April 2015. According to records from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the patent was awarded on 30th May.  At the time of its release, the application was notable for the fact that AT&T hadn’t revealed much of its work with the tech prior. The home subscriber server application was also noteworthy as it revealed that AT&T weighed utilizing the bitcoin blockchain itself versus an implementation of its own.  As explained in the application:  "".... in cases where the decentralized and distributed secure home subscriber server system utilizes the bitcoin blockchain, advantage can be taken of the plethora of nodes contributing and maintaining the security of bitcoin transactions.""  Since that application was first filed, the telecom sought approval for another patent focused in part on in-car payments with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

CoinDesk reported yesterday that Nevada's legislature had cleared the bill, first introduced in March, and sent it to Governor Brian Sandoval for approval. Public records showhttps://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Reports/history.cfm?BillName=SB398 that Gov. Sandoval approved the measure yesterday, enshrining it in state law.  In addition to preventing local governments from taxing the use of a blockchain or smart contract (or requiring a licensure for their use), the bill stipulates ""if a law requires a record to be in writing, submission of a blockchain which electronically contains the record satisfies the law"" – meaning that data from a blockchain can be introduced in ""proceedings"".  The measure enjoyed broad support in the Nevada legislature, public records show. The Senate advanced it by a 21-0 vote in April, followed by the House of Representatives, which also passed it unanimously.  It's the second blockchain-related bill to be signed into law in recent days. On 29th May, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey signed a bill that recognizes the legality of blockchain signatures and smart contracts.

42427604,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWblh,1496759226,Deutsche Börse Reveals Three 'Pillars' of Its Pervasive Blockchain Integration,"One of the largest institutional trading networks in the world has revealed details to CoinDesk about its plan to move the vast majority of its post-trade services to a blockchain.  To maximize the current technological ability of using a shared, distributed ledger, or blockchain, the Frankfurt, Germany-based Deutsche Börse Group decided to focus its efforts solely on post-trade settlement. Following a lengthy analysis of its own internal ecosystem of products that include the Eurex exchange, the Xetra exchange and the Clearstream central securities depository, the conglomerate developed a three-prong plan of attack.  As revealed to CoinDesk, Deutsche Börse has opted to ignore the trading side of its services, for now. It's currently focused almost exclusively on creating a system, using Hyperledger’s open-source Fabric protocol, to transfer securities, move commercial bank money and ensure cross-jurisdictional compliance while doing so.  Dubbed the ""three pillars,"" these projects are being implemented by Ashwin Kumar, Deutsche Börse's global head of product development, who also oversees a wide range of other products.  In conversation with CoinDesk Kumar explained step-by-step how the company, which last year generated €1.1bn in revenue settled on this game plan, along with what’s next for each of the projects.  Kumar said:  ""We came upon basically three major pillars that we felt needed to be addressed in order for this technology to be a viable use case in our ecosystem.""  Three pillars of blockchain  Last year, in an effort to bring it's securities offerings to a blockchain, Deutsche Börse partnered with Germany’s central bank, Deutsche Bundesbank. Originally publisized in November 2016, the first phase of the resulting prototype showed how securities could be transmitted as tokens similar to bitcoin.  Since then, the project has advanced to its second phase, being developed into a production-ready system which Kumar expects will be completed in the next four months. From there, Deutsche Börse plans to initiate the process of formalizing its relationships with early users by granting them credentials to the permissioned, distributed network.  ""There’s a lot of interest,"" said Kumar. ""At the end of the day, to the best of my knowledge, this is the only commercial organization working with a central bank and addressing this.""  The second project, originally revealed this January, is designed to move commercial bank money onto a blockchain.  Built in collaboration with Deutsche Börse Group’s susidiary, Eurex Clearing, the collateralized coin effort called “Collco” is being designed to move the institution's margining requirements, credit risk free payments and delivery-versus-payment asset/value transfer to a blockchain.  Deutsche Börse has completed an early prototype for this product capable of transacting payment for almost any related purpose, including, settlement, custody and collateral management.  ""Most importantly, these coins can then be leveraged by the bank, depending on the credit appetite,"" said Kumar. ""We replicated the commercial bank concept.""  Now that the prototype is complete, the financial firm is in discussions with local German banks and other banks around the world that might be interested in incorporating what is being positioned as a more efficient commercial banking system.  Kumar said:  ""We’ve created a version of what we think is the right mouse trap for getting commercial bank money onto the blockchain.""  The third project currently underway at Deutsche Börse is being conducted in collaboration with the Liquidity Alliance, a group of international central securities depositories founded in January 2013. With membership including Australia’s ASX, Brazil’s Cetip, Spain’s Iberclear and South Africa’s Strate, the alliance is working together to build a prototype that moves securities from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in a compliant way.  For each jurisdiction, the corresponding Liquidity Alliance member is working with the appropriate regulators to integrate a blockchain node in a compliant way. Deutsche Börse is specifically working with the Bundesbank and BaFin, Germany’s federal financial supervisory authority which works mostly with asset managers and investment funds.  ""What we’re doing now is we’re engaging with our local regulators and each other to figure out how we can create a regulatory and legal framework whereby this can become an operational product,” Kumar said.  Still experimenting and learning  Working on these projects are a team of seven full-time blockchain engineers and about 20 employees from the institution's risk departments and elsewhere to work on these pillars from a Frankfurt-based laboratory.  In addition to building out the Hyperledger Fabric platform, the Deutsche Börse team is experimenting with R3’s Corda platform, and are in the early stages of looking into SETL’s blockchain technology.  Initially, Deutsche Börse focused its blockchain efforts on building prototypes centered around the redemption and creation of mutual funds, as well as blockchain proxy voting services which are increasingly proving to be a popular early blockchain use case around the world.  But after several early prototypes were constructed, the firm ""took a step back"" and looked at its entire ecosystem of services from trade to settlement. Unlike blockchain technologies as Medici’s tØ platform which is being built from the ground up so that the trade is the settlement, Deutsche Börse focused exclusively on settlement.  Blockchain technology as it currently exists doesn't meet several criteria Kumar said his company requires for its trading platform. Specifically, he said ""it doesn’t have the latency requirements [and] the scalability requirements, that we need.""  Although, Kumar continued, once the settlement products the institution is working on are adopted by clients, new use cases could be built into a single, integrated network in the future. He concluded:  ""For us, understanding how it can be applied ecosystem-wide, and getting the basic fundamental tenants of what we need in order to do so, is important. From here, we can get them to go out and build applications, whether it’s on the collateral management side, whether its on the commercial bank side, or the settlements side, and tie that all in.""

42427606,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbhh,1496757777,US General Services Administration Plans Blockchain Trial,"The main US agency for governmental logistics is launching a blockchain pilot this summer.  According to Washington, DC's Federal News Radio, the General Services Administration is in the process of researching how it might utilize the tech – a process that will play out over the next couple of months.  The GSA provides logistical support to federal agencies, including transportation and communications services.

He said that the agency is in communication with other parts of the US governmental, as well as so-far-unnamed private-sector businesses, as part of a fact-finding process around blockchain.  According to Herman, the GSA aims to learn about ""those business cases and those needs that the distributed ledger systems that blockchain provides and those technologies provide"".

42427617,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWc3h,1496754003,CoinDesk Research Launches State of Blockchain Q1 Report,"CoinDesk Research's Q1 2017 State of Blockchain report summarizes key trends, data and events in the public and enterprise blockchain sectors in the first quarter of 2017.    Click here to download the slides as a PDF.    The first quarter of 2017 was a big one for the blockchain space.  From the spark of what has become a massive cryptocurrency rally to the emergence of major enterprise efforts like the launch of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the first quarter may ultimately come to be seen as a defining one for the industry.  The first quarter also saw initial coin offerings, or ICOs, continue to gain interest despite unclear regulatory guidance from agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  As showcased in CoinDesk's latest State of Blockchain report, the first quarter of 2017 wasn't all sky-high token valuations and enterprise announcements, however.  Q1 also saw the emergence of all-time highs for bitcoin user transaction fees, while the SEC gave the thumbs-down to two proposed bitcoin ETFs (though one of those decisions is currently under review by the regulator).  Further, the industry saw the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, take on a more active role as a watchdog of the domestic bitcoin exchange ecosystem. This lead to a months-long user balance withdrawal freeze and a shift in the makeup of the world's trading volume.  In the end, though, it was still a blockbuster quarter for the blockchain industry. To get the birds-eye view of what took place, read on for the six major highlights from CoinDesk's newly released report.  1. Cryptocurrencies rally in price  Nearly the entire asset class rallied in the first quarter as the overall market cap gained $7bn to an all-time high of $25bn.  In the months since the end of Q1, the collective market cap of cryptocurrencies has rallied north of $90bn.  In the first quarter, each of the top 10 assets gained value and a wide range of tokens set all-time highs, half with double-digit percentage gains and half with triple gains.  As compared to traditional currencies, bitcoin's rise exceeded that of nearly every major nation, as did precious metals (which are often compared to cryptocurrencies based on limited supply, independence from governments and usage as a hedge against a collapse in traditional financial markets).  The first quarter set the record for the most bitcoin transactions per day (287,098), the largest blocks (0.92 MB) and the most expensive transactions ($0.62).  In June, transaction fees rose to over $5 – see 'Bitcoin's Network is Objectively More Congested Than Ever'.  Other major public blockchains experienced increased usage in the first quarter as well, including ethereum and dash, monero and zcash – a growing sector of 'privacy focused' cryptocurrencies.  The stage has been set for scaling bitcoin both on-chain through proposals like 'SegWit' (which recently went live on litecoin) or increasing fixed maximum block sizes (or hybrids like 'Segwit2Mb') and off-chain through projects like the Lightning Network and Raiden.  3. Regulators significantly impact global markets  The composition of trading shifted in the first quarter as agencies around the globe made decisions impacting cryptocurrency trading structures and treatment.  In January, the People's Bank of China met with the 'Big 3' bitcoin exchanges and other domestic exchanges around the issues of zero exchange fees and AML policies. Global volumes plummeted as OKCoin, Huobi, BTCC and other Chinese exchanges responded by pausing features like withdrawals and margin trading, and increasing fees.  As Chinese trading plunged, a more diverse allocation of worldwide volume emerged and continued into Q2 – see '3 Reasons the Cryptocurrency Exchange Market Is Maturing'.  Other parts of the world saw major regulatory developments – both positive and negative – during that quarter as well.  In March, the SEC rejected the Winklevoss COIN bitcoin ETF, initially proposed almost four years prior. Just weeks later, the SEC rejected another ETF proposal from SolidX, in both cases citing significant unregulated markets.  Across the world, however, Japanese regulators moved to treat bitcoin as a legal payment method, sparking a renewal in interest in the Asian nation.  A Spotlight Study in the Q1 2017 State of Blockchain used a survey distributed in Farsi on Telegram to gauge ""Iranian Blockchain Sentiment"" and found that the largest majority of respondents were using cryptocurrency for cross-border payments.  Notably, the majority of respondents thought the Iranian government would be effective in advancing bitcoin and its community.  As more traditional companies have become involved in blockchain, they have added to the research going into the growing 'permissioned' side of the space.  Enterprise-oriented blockchain projects had an eventful quarter as consortiums grew in size – and pilot projects continued in partnership with major groups and corporations.  In that time, the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project has grown its list of members, proofs-of-concept and frameworks and tools.  The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, launched in February with a combination of major firms and blockchain startups, has the stated goal of interoperability with the public ethereum network.  Decentralized applications (dapps) and token sales continue to draw investor interest as short-term returns have been astronomical for many.  As ethereum's community has grown with more developers coming in (and investors willing to fund them), multiple early projects for different use cases are beginning to appear.  The investor pool is small, however, as only several hundred to thousands of people control the tokens behind several million-dollar market cap projects.  Ethereum dapps are not alone in grouping around use cases, as other broad 'sectors' have only become more apparent over time, like privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, dapp platforms, interoperability-based protocols (like Cosmos and Polkadot) and storage-based assets (like Sia and Storj).  The first quarter also showcased notable data on ICOs, which totaled about a third of the total venture capital volume seen in the first quarter.  Numerous token sales were launched, scheduled and announced soon after, including gnosis, cosmos, brave, tezos, civic and kik.  At the end of May, cumulative ICO funding passed venture capital for the year – see 'ICO Investments Pass VC Funding in Blockchain Market First'.  As the market has grown, the players in the market have evolved, with specialized legal and advisory services, investment funds, and more, launching to cater to and profit from the trend.  The main Spotlight Study in the Q1 2017 State of Blockchain was the ""Bitcoin and Ethereum Sentiment Survey"".  The survey revealed that the community was extremely enthusiastic about most aspects around the 'state of ethereum'. That said, a number were torn – and bordering on the negative – regarding many aspects of the 'state of bitcoin'.  The full survey covers numerous aspects of the protocols and ecosystems, but perhaps just one chart says it all when weighing the overall level of sentiment (at least among this group of respondents) – see 'Enthusiasm for Ethereum Hits an All-Time High'.

42427602,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbnh,1496751039,Blockchain Consortium Draws Enterprise Giants to Revolutionize Digital Identity,"Not yet a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), IBM's blockchain director Jerry Cuomo was already thinking about assisting the effort just moments after being introduced to the group at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference.  ""The need to standardize is key,"" he told CoinDesk, explaining the appeal of DIF, the newest blockchain consortia in an increasing diverse ecosystem.  ""It's a good start,"" he adds.  But while IBM may just be getting up to speed, involved in the effort before launch are enterprise firms like Microsoft and Accenture, along with a long list of startups. These include more well-known names (Civic, Gem, IDEO, Netki), and those seeking to make an impact (Consent and Blockchain Foundary) in the digital identity space.  As explained by Wayne Vaughan, CEO of member startup Tierion, what unites the group is a focus on building open-source software, code that will support all the different blockchain identity work ongoing throughout the world.  ""It's about contributing to common technologies for certain areas, and still being able to run our businesses,"" Vaughan said. ""Take Civic. If people are generating identities and running Civic, if it's only inside Civic that this works, what's the point?”  Instead, this new breed of identity company concentrated on blockchain needs to work together, he argued – at least on the core architecture that more specific identity applications will ride on.  Vaughan continued:  ""Our real competition isn't with each other, but with the big identifiers in the world: Facebook, Apple, Twitter. They control all the identity information that we have.""  More specifically, common areas of work include ensuring interoperability of names and identifiers used in blockchain identity systems; the attestations and reputation data enabling verification of information associated with these identities; and methods for securing the blockchain-based identity data underlying them.  The long-term goal is to use this approach to create tools that enable a college like New York University, for example, to validate to others that someone really graduated from a certain program.  But the result could be that such systems even enable new forms of identification and authentication not yet realized or conceived. For instance, autonomous machine-to-machine payments have been on many industry participants' minds since blockchain for the Internet of Things (IoT) environment got a serious new look after several commercial applications proved viable.  ""These identifiers and names are not just for people,"" Vaughan explained. ""It's for companies and devices. The blockchain provides a root of trust that isn't controlled by any one organization.""  A new domain  What does a blockchain-based identity system look like in practice?  Those involved seem to have a clear idea. The end result, Vaughan hopes, is that there will be a reference implementation that all the companies involved can use to call and query identity-related information. But one that's distributed and decentralized.  If you were to build such a system with today’s tools, Vaughan explains, it's very possible to end up with all your data stored on a cloud platform like Amazon Web Services or Dropbox.  This centralized system, though, is vulnerable to hacks, snooping and other types of compromise. By using a blockchain-based system, however, data could be called and verified (instead of just shared), enabling the selective disclosure and verification of the underlying information in a way that puts control back in the hands of users.  ""It's like name services on the web. Here's the four locations where Wayne's stuff is, no matter if it's running on our version. They can speak the same protocol,"" Vaughan said.  With this new system, Vaughan continued, he might chose to use a string of letters – say 'vaughan.id' – to represent his identity, the same way he might have 'Tierion.com' to represent his business online today. Just as on the internet, this moniker would aim to be broadly accessible, not barred off like early email silos.  Looking forward  So, where is the system in development today?  According to Microsoft’s head of decentralized identity, Daniel Buchner, four working groups are underway so far. Yet, individual companies involved in the working groups are still seeking to build out their existing infrastructure in their preferred way. Blockstack, for example, will continue to use the bitcoin blockchain, while uPort will build on ethereum.  As explained by DIF members, the goal now is to enlist other developers and other standards groups, like the W3C and IETF, which are already active in this area. For now, this means more conversations with key players such as IBM to help the foundation reimagine how identity services could be delivered in the future, in the hope of doing it better than our current system.  ""IBM worked with the US government on social security, and that has become, in the US to this day, the cornerstone of how we share our identity,"" IBM's Cuomo said.  He concluded:  ”It's 2017, we can do better than that.”  Digital identity image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/06/06/blockchain-consortium-draws-enterprise-giants-to-revolutionize-digital-identity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/688881956a6ecef685f07307be6652660c798777-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
