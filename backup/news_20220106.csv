42375561,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8wu1,1641511805,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Stabilizes Near $43K as Layer 1 Tokens Attract Attention,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin stabilized near $43,000 after Wednesday’s sell-off, while traders’ attention turned to layer 1 tokens.  Technician’s take: Oversold signals remain intact for bitcoin, although upside is limited.  Catch the latest episodes ofCoinDesk TVfor insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,073 -1.09%  Ether (ETH): $3,407 -4.097%  Markets  S&P 500: 4,696-0.096%  DJIA: 36,236 -0.47%  Nasdaq: 15,080 -0.13%  Gold: $1,790 -1.09%  Market moves  Bitcoin stabilized at around $43,000 after it fell to nearly $42,000, while a few layer 1 tokens such as Harmony (ONE), Fantom (FTM), Cosmos (ATOM) and NEAR (NEAR) quickly turned to green despite Wednesday’s broader market sell-off.  At the time of writing, bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, was trading at $43,073, down by 1.09% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data.  Data from TradingView and Binance shows that most of the dumping events took place on Wednesday during U.S. trading hours. Notably, the price of the No. 1 cryptocurrency took only a small hit during Asian trading hours on Thursday.  Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel wrote in its newsletter dated Wednesday that bitcoin failed to follow U.S. stocks’ “Santa Rally” in the last week of 2021, potentially because of China’s crypto trading ban. Dec. 31 was the deadline for many Chinese crypto exchanges to stop offering crypto trading services to users from mainland China.  The mild sell-off during trading hours in Asia, a trading session known as bearish for crypto prices in 2021, could indicate that the China-related crypto selling pressure may have ended.  Meanwhile, crypto Twitter shows that many traders have turned their attention to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) trading, with a few layer 1 tokens having logged gains despite a broader crypto sell-off.  According to Messari’s asset screener, ONE, ATOM, FTM and NEAR – all tokens associated with smart-contract platforms – are among some of the biggest winners on Thursday. Prices of Harmony’s ONE token, for example, were up by 10.7% at the time of writing.  Crypto traders continued to bet on the success of layer 1 tokens, as SOL, LUNA and AVAX last year logged impressive price returns. Layer 1 blockchains have been one of the biggest narratives in the crypto industry, especially during the past few years. Their success came as Ethereum, the No. 1 blockchain by the total value of tokens locked in the smart contract, became too congested, leading to an increase in its transactions fees.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Stabilizes After Sell-Off, Resistance Near $45K-$50K  Bitcoin dipped below initial support at $45,000 on Wednesday, but later stabilized at around $42,000, which is near the Dec. 5 crash low. Oversold signals remain intact, which suggests selling pressure could subside.  Given the series of lower price highs since November, support ranges and oversold readings are viewed as countertrends. That lowers the probability of significant buying strength until the downtrend is reversed.  There is strong resistance ahead, which could limit upside moves over the short term. For example, price momentum turned negative on the monthly chart, indicating a possible trend shift from bullish to bearish.  Further, bitcoin remains stuck below key moving averages and is roughly 35% below its all-time high of around $69,000.  The cryptocurrency is down about 8% over the past week as buyers failed to sustain a break above $50,000.

42375554,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8wmT,1641510249,SEC Charges Founder of Crypto Startup Crowd Machine With Fraud,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Craig Sproule of Australia – along with two crypto companies he founded, Crowd Machine Inc. and Metavine Inc. – with defrauding investors.  The SEC said in a statement Thursday that Sproule and Crowd Machine used over $5.8 million in proceeds from an initial coin offering offered between January and April 2018 to invest in gold mining entities in South Africa, which wasn’t disclosed to investors.  The SEC says Sproule initially told investors that proceeds would be used to develop a new technology that would enable Metavine’s existing application-development software to run on a decentralized network of users’ own computers. Sproule claimed to have raised $40.7 million through his companies in the ICO, according to the SEC.  The SEC also alleged that Crowd Machine and Sproule didn’t properly register their offerings and sales of Crowd Machine Compute Tokens (CMCT), and sold the tokens to groups of investors without determining whether the tokens were accredited.  The complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ordered Sproule to pay a $195,047 civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Sproule and Crowd Machine have consented to judgments permanently banning them from participating in future securities offerings. They also agreed to seek the removal of CMCT tokens from crypto trading platforms.  Disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties for Crowd Machine will be determined by the court at a later date, as will disgorgement and prejudgment interest for Metavine.  “As alleged, Sproule and Crowd Machine misled investors about how they were using ICO proceeds, spending funds on an entirely unrelated scheme,” Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit, said in the statement.  “We will continue to hold accountable issuers of digital asset securities who fail to provide fulsome and truthful disclosure to the public,” she added.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/06/sec-charges-founder-of-crypto-startup-crowd-machine-with-fraud,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2670093abd806a5401e22517f008c5439040fbc5-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The video-game retailer hopes the new unit will lead its turnaround efforts to become profitable, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with its plans.  GameStop’s plan calls for it to build an online hub for buying, selling and trading NFTs of virtual video-game goods such as avatar outfits and weapons.

The Grapevine, Texas-based company is also close to signing partnerships with two crypto companies to share technology as well as co-invest in games and in other NFT-related projects, the Wall Street Journal said.  Prices for LRC, the native token of layer 2 protocol Loopring, spiked about 15% on the news. There have been rumors that Loopring is one of the crypto companies that is working with GameStop on its NFT marketplace. That speculation sent LRC’s price soaring in November.

42375558,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8wqF,1641505688,Polygon Under Accidental Attack From Swarm of Sunflower Farmers,"A blockchain normally known for its high throughput has been hobbled today by a surprising foe: a simple blockchain-based agriculture game called Sunflower Farmers.  Since at least Tuesday, Polygon proof-of-stake chain users have been taking to social media to gripe about failed transactions and degraded performance across the blockchain.  However, instead of a complex financial product taxing blockchains like Solana or an NFT drop clogging Ethereum for hours at a time, Sunflower Farmers is a simple resource-gathering game that uses blockchain transactions for in-game actions – a dynamic some have likened to an unintentional distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. A Sunflower Farm team member didn’t respond to a request for comment by press time.  The blockchain-wide slowdown is reminiscent of the early days of CryptoKitties, a 2017 non-fungible token hit that clogged the Ethereum network for weeks at a time with “breeding” and trading-related transactions.  Read more: Cat Fight? Ethereum Users Clash Over CryptoKitties  Both Polygon’s throughput and the strains Sunflower Farm is placing on the blockchain are orders of magnitude larger than 2017′s game-related blockchain clog, however.  A transaction on Polygon now costs roughly 500 gwei, or $0.50, up from fractions of a cent. Additionally, the number of active addresses on Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain has spiked 60% in a single week, with more than 200,000 accounts transacting on the chain. Current speculation is that many of those addresses are “bots.”  “Botting” play-to-earn games – creating accounts that are controlled programmatically to earn in-game rewards – is endemic in the blockchain gaming industry, with titles like Axie Infinity and Alien Worlds struggling to differentiate between players enjoying a game and computers farming digital cash.  Read more: Inside Alien Worlds, the Biggest Game in the Metaverse  Dan Elitzer, a co-founder of Nascent, a crypto investment firm, wrote on Twitter that Polygon’s normally high throughput might be partly to blame for Sunflower’s transaction-heavy mechanics, saying, “If you make global state&computation ~free, people will do stupid shit until it breaks or the price increases enough to make them stop.”  Likewise, one Delphi Labs developer said that the incident is a prime example of why more games should have dedicated, application-specific chains, such as Axie Infinity’s Ronin.

42375548,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8wdf,1641504937,A16z Leads Additional $25M Round for DeFi Credit Protocol Goldfinch,"Decentralized credit protocol Goldfinch has raised $25 million in a Series A extension round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which had led the protocol’s $11 million Series A round last June.  Goldfinch serves as an open marketplace for loans without collateral using a decentralized loan underwriting process. The Goldfinch protocol extends credit lines to lending businesses, which can draw stablecoins from the Goldfinch pool and then deploy the capital to local borrowers.  Goldfinch provides the access to global capital but leaves the loan origination and servicing to the lending businesses.  Investors can deposit crypto into the Goldfinch pool to earn yield. When lending businesses make interest payments back to Goldfinch, the money is disbursed to all of the participating investors.  Goldfinch has grown its outstanding loan volume from $250,000 a year ago to over $38 million. The protocol is serving over 200,000 borrowers in 18 countries. Goldfinch capital is being used for a wide range of uses, including motorcycle taxis in Kenya and small businesses in Brazil.  “By removing the need for crypto collateral and providing a means for passive yield, Goldfinch is dramatically expanding lending to more potential borrowers and capital providers,” wrote a16z General Partner Arianna Simpson in an announcement post.  Other investors in the round included noted hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, crypto investment firm BlockTower and investment management firm Kingsway Capital.

42375559,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8wrV,1641504253,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Sentiment Turns Extremely Bearish,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are stabilizing after a sell-off on Wednesday. Some analysts expect crypto volatility to remain elevated this month, especially as investors reduced their exposure to other assets deemed to be risky such as equities.  Wednesday’s sell-off resulted in $800 million in liquidations, which accelerated price moves. Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading.  Some analysts are watching the recent rise in leverage among bitcoin futures traders, which typically signals more risk in the market.  From a technical perspective, bitcoin could see a countertrend bounce, although upside appears to be limited.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,163, -2.41%  Ether (ETH): $3,418, -5.71%  S&P 500: $4,696, -0.10%  Gold: $1,788, -1.20%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.72%  Bearish sentiment indicator  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, which measures sentiment among market participants, is at its lowest level since July. The low reading indicates market fear and is often seen as a contrarian indicator among crypto traders.  “The Fear and Greed Index hasn’t signaled greed in more than one and a half months - an unusually long period of negative market sentiment,” Arcane Research wrote in a report.  Still, the index can remain in “fear” mode for as long as a month as prices typically move sideways before a decisive move up or down.  Bitcoin drawdown deepens  Bitcoin is roughly 35% below its all-time high of almost $69,000, which was set in November. The drawdown, or percentage decline from peak to trough, is the largest since July. Previous drawdowns have reached levels of nearly 80% and took several months to recover.  For now, drawdowns have been less severe over the past year relative to prior extremes.  The chart below is from financial data provider Koyfin.  Altcoin roundup  Polkadot, Solana among biggest losers: The tokens of Ethereum rivals Avalanche (AVAX), Terra (LUNA) and Solana (SOL) – the so-termed ‘SoLunAvax’ trade – fell by as much as 12% in the past 24 hours. Polkadot (DOT), another Ethereum rival, saw its tokens fall by 14% before seeing a slight revival during Asian trading hours on Thursday. Tokens of those networks have risen several hundred percent in the past year, mainly as investors looked for blockchain alternatives outside of Ethereum, according to CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa. Read more here.  Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) dominance at risk: The scaling of the Ethereum network, which is needed to maintain its dominance, may arrive too late, JPMorgan said in a report. The final phase of the sharding, which is crucial for scaling the network, won’t arrive before next year. Meanwhile, alternative blockchains such as Terra, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana, Fantom, Tron and Polygon have been gaining the most market share in the DeFi sector.  Dip in decentralized exchange volumes: Despite the recent crypto crash, the total value locked in DeFi tokens has remained stable at around 6% below all-time highs, according to data from Messari. “However, the momentum of the decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have lagged behind other explosive DeFi activities,” Messari wrote in a Thursday newsletter. Monthly DEX volumes remain below previous all-time highs since June.

It offers crypto-to-fiat and crypto-to-crypto exchange services, and supports euros, U.S. dollars, bitcoin, ether, litecoin, bitcoin cash, XRP and other assets. It is led by CEO Julian Sawyer, a co-founder and former CEO of Starling Bank, a U.K. digital bank.  Bitstamp has been a proponent of regulation and compliance, and is audited by EY, a Big Four accounting firm. It emphasizes security and claims to have “military-grade storage” of assets. It allows fiat deposits from users by SEPA (single euro payments area) transfer or international bank wire or with a credit card and can be accessed online or through a mobile app. While Bitstamp doesn’t charge fees for cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals, it charges a fee for buying and selling crypto that varies depending on the amount and source (i.e. credit card transfer vs. fiat on platform).  In 2019, the exchange was granted a BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services four years after it applied. That allows Bitstamp to offer its cryptocurrency trading pairs to residents in the state. Last May, it announced plans to expand in the U.S., and in July, it named Robert Zagotta, a former executive at CME Group and crypto industry veteran, as CEO of Bitstamp US.  In 2015, hackers stole nearly 19,000 BTC from the exchange. A confidential document posted to Reddit revealed that hackers distributed files containing malware to targeted Bitstamp employees. The files included malicious scripts that automatically ran upon downloading the file, allowing attackers to compromise particular servers to perform the hack. In response, Bitstamp refunded affected users, and subsequently implemented multi-sig wallets, increased security technology and extended insurance coverage with Paragon International Insurance Brokers to cover employee theft, fraud and other loss. Bitstamp also offers cold storage provided by BitGo and Copper.co.

The bank, which began offering crypto custody and brokerage of bitcoin and ether back in 2019, announced Thursday that it was adding access to fantom (FTM), aave (AAVE), compound (COMP), synthetix (SNX), chainlink (LINK), polygon (MATIC), the graph (GRT), curve (CRV), uniswap (UNI) and yearn finance (YFI).  A bank offering its clients DeFi tokens is another step in the institutional DeFi narrative, now being driven by announcements like the recent launch of Aave Arc, with its whitelisting of regulated entities courtesy of custody firm Fireblocks.  While asset managers such as Bitwise and others have DeFi funds on offer, you’d be hard-pressed to find another traditional bank putting DeFi coins on the bill of fare. (Some of the newer crypto-focused banks in Switzerland such as Sygnum and SEBA Bank have already got DeFi tokens on the menu.)  Crypto cred  Arab Bank Switzerland was established back in 1962 and was the first international affiliate of Arab Bank Group, which held $49 billion in assets as of 2018. The Swiss entity has $5 billion in assets under management, a spokesman said.  As well as custodying BTC and ETH, Arab Bank Switzerland also offers staking on the Tezos blockchain.  Read more: Fireblocks ‘Whitelists’ 30 Trading Firms for Aave’s Institutional DeFi Debut  Romain Braud, the bank’s digital assets director, said offering DeFi tokens to clients was a first step, with a view to more involvement in yield-generating protocols further down the line.  “The idea for now is just for our clients to buy, sell and hold some of the most prominent DeFi tokens,” said Braud in an interview. “But we do believe traditional financial institutions will be replaced in the near future by these protocols, and we want to be part of this change. So, naturally in the future, we want to go deeper into these kinds of decentralized services.”  Braud says Arab Bank Switzerland distinguishes itself from some of the newer crypto banks, because it is part of a well-capitalized group, and also has the Middle East connection.  “We have a lot of legacy clients in the Middle East,” said Braud. “A bank that understands the Middle East, but is also based in Switzerland, is really a good combination for them.”  CORRECTION (Jan. 6, 20:43 UTC): Arab Bank Switzerland was founded in 1962, not 1961.",POSITIVE,BTC | LINK | YFI,BTC | FIAT | LINK | XTZ | YFI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/06/arab-bank-switzerland-is-quietly-offering-clients-defi-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be199a01067a48aa987f0a6b70f0841f0708f6c5-2000x1335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411566,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOsXo,1641496951,Not Everyone Can Afford to Be Satoshi,"In a recent open letter reflecting on his invention of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee first thanked his boss.  “I was very lucky, back in 1990, to be allowed some time to sit and code,” he writes, before entering into a straightforward account of how HTTP, HTML and URLs came to be. These three protocols, about 9,555 lines written in the Objective-C programming language, are the backbone of the web as we know it – the communication tool that has, as Berners-Lee puts it, “changed everything.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Berners-Lee, a trained physicist, was working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland at the time. He was paid a salary for his work, even the time spent noodling. But the web, which has made countless people vast fortunes, didn’t make Berners-Lee a billionaire. A few months ago, he auctioned off an image of the World Wide Web source code as an NFT for $5.4 million – one of the few times Lee has profited directly from the code.  Like other general purpose technologies, from GPS to the internet itself, developed during a particular age of massive government defense and science spending in the back half of the 20th century, the web was essentially gifted to the world as free and open source software (FOSS). Anyone can access and build on it. It’s an age that some web developers pine for, and many still put Berners-Lee up as a model for open source development.  This past weekend, Laurie Voss, a co-founder of npm, a GitHub-acquired company that builds open source tools, did just that. He was making an argument against the funding model that seems to be predominant in Web 3, a buzzword to describe the litany of blockchain-based and non-crypto projects aiming to put user identity and dignity at the center of the internet.  “The whole point of ‘web3′ is supposed to be that it’s democratic and decentralized and everybody benefits from the value they provide to the network. That’s a great idea! It is entirely antithetical to a system where early adopters get outsized returns. We already have that,” Voss tweeted.  In particular, Voss, like many before him, noted the potential conflicts of interest that token-based projects present. Pre-mines, or tokens minted and held in reserve for early investors and project developers, are both incentives to build useful tools that attract users and huge non-cash grants awaiting exit liquidity (read: retail token buyers).  It’s all part of a larger backlash against Web 3, techlash 3.0, and crypto generally. It’s not hard to see how the presence of venture capitalists like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and others, which stand to gain a lot by bullying for crypto adoption, stand counter to the egalitarian roots of crypto.  Read more: What Jack Dorsey’s Beef With ‘Web 3′ Is Really About | David Z. Morris  This all the more evident when Web 3 is compared to bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency developed pseudonymously by Satoshi Nakamoto, who, as far as we know, has never profited from their invention. That was the standard way cypherpunks and many FOSS developers operated – in it for the ideas, for the battle for privacy and digital rights. It’s a romantic ideal, but doable.  “I like the idea of giving away ideas and people who can code giving away code. It enables a collaborative approach where many others can work on it and build on it. This has been a strength of Bitcoin. All the work by all the devs is given away freely and anyone can use the software as they wish,” Bruce Fenton, an early bitcoin adopter and registered broker, said in a text message.  Four years ago this week, Fenton unveiled Ravencoin, a Bitcoin fork with a few modifications for throughput, that is now a billion-dollar digital asset. Fenton said he has never profited from Ravencoin and is now unaffiliated with the free and open source project. Although Fenton managed to pull a Satoshi, he doesn’t necessarily admonish others looking to profit from code.  “FOSS can work with all kinds of models – patronage, partnership with for-profit enterprises or even things like sales. But whenever you are paying real money for a token it is crucial to ask what you are getting for that in return,” he said.  This is a view I tend to agree with. If coders can manage to stay anonymous and walk away from their proceeds, that only strengthens a project. But FOSS is an ideal that’s hard to reach. Coders code and deserve to get paid for their work. Tools like NFTs or even ICOs can be done fairly without compromising on the founding values of crypto. It’s hard, but doable.  Read more: Most Influential (2020) – Filecoin’s Juan Benet  I’ll state bluntly that there is absolutely no point to crypto without decentralization. Having a “founder” that sticks around is an attack vector. Having massive bag holders is unseemly. If a blockchain can be “censored,” it should be. But projects can – and sometimes do – decentralize overtime. Starting from the position that everyone needs to be an ascetic like Satoshi or Berners-Lee puts everyone at a disadvantage.  Not everyone is in Berners-Lee’s position when he coded the web, an employee of a publicly-funded institution building “public goods.” It’s a new age, we have new tools and new funding models. And thanks be. Even Berners-Lee notes the web “is not yet the best it can be.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/06/not-everyone-can-afford-to-be-satoshi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bea725dc222090d7dd7fc0173feac109927a15d5-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This may mean that a bear period similar to then has started. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Continue To Realize Losses As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, Bitcoin short-term holders have continued to realize profits recently, as suggested by the SOPR. This trend may be similar to the one seen in June. The &apos;Spent Output Profit Ratio,&apos; or SOPR in short, is an indicator that measures the profit ratio of the overall market by looking at the price each coin was sold at and comparing it with the price it was bought at. When the value of this metric is above one, it means holders are, on an average, selling at a profit. On the other hand, SOPR values less than one would mean investors are currently dumping their Bitcoin at a loss. The value of the metric when exactly equal to one would imply that the overall BTC market is currently breaking even. A modification of this indicator is the short-term holder (STH) SOPR. This metric accounts for only those coins that were held for less than 155 days before being sold. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH SOPR over the past year: The indicator currently seems to be below one | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH SOPR has remained below one for a while now, showing that these holders have been selling...",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/start-of-bear-period-current-bitcoin-trend-june/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42375544,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8wYd,1641489360,Will DAOs Replace Crypto Venture Capital?,"Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, have recently formed to try to buy the U.S. Constitution and a professionally certified golf course.  Now they are organizing to deploy capital into cryptocurrency startup companies, potentially disrupting the venture capital funding model that has financed waves of new technologies for generations.  Crypto investment-focused DAOs have become the new arena for sourcing deals, meeting company founders and cutting checks – all functions that were typically done by well-heeled venture capitalists who prided themselves on their industry-insider status.  “We’re trying to democratize crypto investing and provide access to those that never had such access,” said Joyce Yang, founder of Global Coin Research, a DAO that “aims to disrupt the VC model.”  DAOs are blockchain-based organizations that are decentralized and unregulated in the traditional sense, often governed by a native crypto token.  In the past year, DAOs have sprung up with weed-like vigor, surpassing 1.6 million in membership in December, up 130-fold from just 13,000 members last January, according to DAO data provider DeepDAO.  But for funding new tech companies, DAOs are a hitherto untested model, partly because venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm have so thoroughly dominated the business of funding entrepreneurs in crypto and other fast-emerging technologies.  Access to deals and founders  Enter “investment DAOs,” which are collectives of crypto-enthused individuals capable of investing their personal capital or directing portions of the DAO’s treasury into early-stage crypto startups.  Typically, membership in an investment-focused DAO involves an upfront buy-in in the form of the DAO’s governance token in exchange for access to private spaces – invite-only Discord chats, Telegram groups or in-person events – where deals can be sourced and checks written.  Take, for example, members of Global Coin Research (GCR), who have cumulatively invested in more than 30 deals, deploying over $25 million into projects such as blockchain interoperability protocol Aurora and Web 3 management platform Coinvise. (In order to participate in a deal, the individual DAO member must be an accredited investor, typically defined as individuals who are legally authorized to purchase securities that aren’t registered with regulatory authorities.)  As of December, GCR estimates its investments have seen average returns over 40-fold for projects that become liquid or marked to market.  “Crypto has allowed micro VCs to really thrive, because the return on investment on blockchain projects can be in the thousands of percent,” said Michael Steinberg, founder of venture capital firm Reciprocal Ventures. Steinberg dubbed investment DAOs as “fundamental recasts” of angel networks or syndicates – loosely organized networks of investors whom early-stage startups have traditionally turned to for funding.  Perhaps the most well-known syndicate is AngelList, which allows accredited investors to participate in deals alongside top venture capital firms such as Tiger Global or Y Combinator.  “The problem with the syndicates is, as a passive investor, you have no access to the founder” of the startup, Steinberg said. “With DAOs, there’s no gating intermediary to block your access.”  Community support  Founders also can benefit from their interaction with the DAO, which includes receiving product feedback and advice from a crypto-native community. For fledgling crypto startups, user adoption and product-market fit are all too familiar challenges they – and their non-crypto counterparts – still face.  Raising funds from investment DAOs “helped us in bootstrapping our own community by on-boarding new members through co-hosting events with GCR,” said Jenil Thakker, founder of Coinvise, who has worked with both GCR and The LAO, another investment DAO. “More broadly, investment DAOs offer access to a much wider network of people that can help projects get early feedback.”  For Coinvise, a DAO infrastructure company, GCR helped the startup with product testing, including using the Coinvise platform to launch its GCR governance token.  “It’s becoming a thing now that founders need a community when they fundraise,” GCR’s Yang told CoinDesk. “A project wants to find a good crypto native team and get their products used. They also want a community to provide feedback.”  According to Thakker, most investment DAOs even offer media, hiring and legal services to support their portfolio companies.  “Offering all these at a traditional venture firm costs money and often is not scalable,” Thakker said.  A hybrid future  As cryptocurrencies have grown to nearly $3 trillion in market capitalization, investor capital has rabidly chased the booming industry’s eye-popping returns, leading to the formation of several prominent investment DAOs with varying flavors. These include Komorebi Collective, which invests in female founders, and FlamingoDAO, which focuses on non-fungible tokens.  The trend raises the question of whether DAOs will encroach on, or one day, replace traditional venture capital.  “It’s possible,” says Reciprocal’s Steinberg. However, “crypto venture capital is a full-time job. VC firms are generally very active, highly engaged, and have lots of time and resources to devote to portfolio companies. We’re all for partnering with DAOs, but some founders need playbooks.”  “I definitely view their power increasing over time,” Third Prime Capital’s Christian Kaczmarczyk told CoinDesk. “The venture firms who work with DAOs will be successful in the long term.”  Other venture capitalists say the DAO venture model is still lagging traditional VCs in terms of operational capabilities and efficiency.  “As far as I’ve seen, projects value DAOs for the strength of their individual members and capacity for useful partnerships, but still overwhelmingly prefer traditional funds to lead rounds,” said Kyle Wang of Valhalla Capital, who says he is also active in some investment DAOs.  But as DAOs gain increasing market share on startup cap tables, a hybrid model appears to be taking shape, combining the community-driven ethos of DAOs with the deep pockets and operational expertise of venture capitalists.  “There’s room for more centralized investors alongside the extremely democratized investment syndicates, similar to how FTX and Coinbase are viewed alongside Uniswap as liquidity venues,” said Evan Feng, head of research at crypto venture firm CoinFund. “There’s room for hybrid approaches as the boundaries between the two camps blur further.”  Investment DAOs also carry with them risks associated with cryptocurrencies, such as regulatory scrutiny, mismanaged DAO treasuries or flaws in little-tested technologies. An individual DAO’s investment track record is also important, helping more established DAOs stand out from the pack.  But in a crypto bull market, it’s the startup founders who ultimately have the power when it comes to the types of investors they work with.  “Entrepreneurs should choose investors which most align with their vision and give them the greatest chance for success,” says Third Prime’s Kaczmarczyk. “If that is a DAO, then so be it.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/06/will-daos-replace-crypto-venture-capital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1577e7815446e4aeab2139ca997f0e41ae370d0-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375545,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8wZt,1641488486,Crypto Miners Are Better Investments Than Bitcoin Even After Sell-Off: Analysts,"Crypto miners are having a tough start to the new year, with their shares extending December’s decline as bitcoin fell below $43,000. However, Wall Street analysts are staying upbeat on the sector’s outlook and still prefer the miners over the cryptocurrencies they produce.  The shares of publicly listed miners such as Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain, Hive Mining and Hut 8 are down about 10% in just the first week of 2022. Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto-Mining & Semiconductor ETF (RIGZ), a miner-heavy exchange-traded fund, has also lost about 10% this week and is priced around the lowest levels since its inception in July, according to TradingView data.  The miners, whose shares are heavily correlated to the price of the coins they produce, are reflecting declines across the crypto market. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell more than 5% Wednesday alone after minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting in December pointed to a possible interest-rate increase in March, which is sooner than many had expected. Ether, the second-largest, slid almost 7%. Both declined further today.  “While market excesses are clearly taking a beating with the anticipated rise in interest rates, we firmly believe current valuations have nothing to do with fundamentals and more due to the lack of institutional buy-in to this relatively obscure new sector,” Christopher Brendler, an analyst at investment bank D.A. Davidson, said in a research note.  The miners are still extremely profitable and gross margins remain “super healthy” despite a rising network hashrate and the sharp decline in bitcoin price, Brendler wrote. “With the stocks at these levels, the miners offer a superior risk/reward to the underlying BTC as we see limited downside from here, barring a complete BTC collapse sub $10K,” he said.  Brendler previously highlighted Core Scientific as his favorite “buy-and-hold” miner and named Marathon Digital as the top mining stock pick heading into 2022.  The Bitcoin network hashrate surged to a record about 210 exahash per second (EH/s) on Jan. 1, according to data analytics firm Glassnode. It fell to about 181 EH/s on Jan. 5, after protesters in Kazakhstan, second only to the U.S. in hashrate, stormed government buildings to complain about surging energy costs, leading the country’s largest telecommunications provider to shut down access to the internet.  Read more: Kazakhstan’s Hashrate Drops as Internet Blackout Persists Amid Nationwide Protests  Bitcoin miners are a “compelling investment alternative” compared with other forms of direct and indirect exposure to the largest cryptocurrency, according to investment bank Cowen. The publicly traded miners are poised to increase their market share of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate to about 36% by the end of the year from 13% currently, Cowen’s analyst Stephen Glagola said.  The miners have cost leadership and production scale, which offer better investment opportunities than volatile bitcoin, Glagola said. He initiated coverage of Stronghold Digital Mining with an outperform rating and a 12-month price target of $22 per share and Iris Energy with an outperform rating and a $31 price target. Stronghold shares are down about 2% and Iris 17% this week.

Autonomy is bringing NFTs to life, the autonomous NFTs (aNFTs) that can do things on behalf of their holder through automation. Autonomous NFTs? Is That Even Possible? The current generation of non-fungible tokens is static and primarily a one-trick pony. Moreover, the industry suffers from tremendous speculation rather than utility. Although that situation slowly changes, there is still little one can do with an NFT. All of that will change in the future, at least where the Autonomy Network is considered.

42411845,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgabe,1641486913,Your First Crypto Wallet: What Is a Crypto Wallet and How to Use It,"Crypto wallets are like online bank accounts for your cryptocurrencies but with a few key differences: cryptocurrency wallets are not backed by government deposit schemes, they only hold cryptocurrencies (no regular money here) and, crucially, you are in control of your funds at all times.  Non-custodial is the term given to cryptocurrency wallets, like MetaMask, Rainbow Wallet or Trust Wallet, that are separate from the accounts you may have on cryptocurrency exchanges. When you hold money on a crypto exchange, like Binance, Kraken or Coinbase, those companies are in control of your cryptocurrencies. But when you move your crypto to a non-custodial wallet, you hold the keys to your wallet.  These wallets are the key to the decentralized web and serve as the primary way to interface with decentralized finance protocols, like lending protocols, decentralized exchanges or non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. Crypto wallets are so foundational to decentralized finance that some people on Twitter or Discord refer to themselves solely by their cryptocurrency wallet addresses – anyone who introduces themselves with a username that starts with “0x” is referring to their Ethereum address.  What is a crypto wallet for?  Unless you’re running a huge company holding so much cryptocurrency that you need the watchful eye of a specialized custodian – a third party that looks after your crypto for you – you’re looking for a non-custodial wallet. These are, as mentioned, wallets to which only you hold the keys. You may have read the adage, “not your keys, not your crypto.” This phrase is commonly used and stresses the importance of looking after your own crypto.  Read more: What Is Crypto Custody?  With non-custodial crypto wallets, your assets are backed by something called a private key. This functions as a password to your crypto wallet. You must shroud this in secrecy and never tell anyone about it. Should you lose your private key, you’ll be able to use something called a secret phrase, or seed phrase. These are strings of 12 or 24 words that function as a backup password. It’s important to hide these in a trusted place, ideally by holding parts of the phrase in different places. No company or individual should ever ask for your seed phrase – those that do are almost always scams looking to steal your funds.  How to choose a crypto wallet  Different blockchains require different wallets. MetaMask, one of the most popular wallets, supports just a handful of networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon (MATIC) and Avalanche (the common denominator is that these chains all support the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)). MetaMask does not support Solana or Bitcoin, however, there are a number of other options including Trust Wallet that do support Bitcoin.  NFT support requires special attention. Most wallets natively support fungible tokens, like ethereum, bitcoin and so on. But non-fungible tokens – crypto art, like Tyler Hobb’s Fidenza or the Bored Ape Yacht Club – are handled a little differently. Marketplaces like OpenSea, although not wallets, will automatically display your Ethereum NFTs if you connect your wallets. Rainbow Wallet displays NFTs within its app.  When choosing a wallet, a good rule of thumb is to check which wallets are recommended by a coin’s community. Solana’s community champions SolFlare and Phantom, while Monero’s sings the praises of Cake Wallet. Bitcoincash.org recommends the Bitcoin.com wallet, among others.  Read More: How to Store Your Bitcoin  Most of these wallets function as either desktop wallets, browser extensions or mobile wallets. Those that function as browser extensions are particularly useful when interfacing with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The websites of Uniswap, Aave, Compound and more each have a “connect wallet” button. This functionality replaces the “log in to Google”/ “enter your email and password” of Web 2.  How to set up a crypto wallet  Setting up a crypto wallet only takes a couple of minutes. To get started with MetaMask, either download the app on your phone or install the browser extension. Then, MetaMask will ask you to set a password to the app, name your wallet, then write down your secret phrase (and then get you to check that you have done so). And that’s it! You can then use your wallet to send or receive funds.  To find out your address, click the name of your wallet and MetaMask will copy it to your clipboard. Other wallets have near-identical setup processes.  Read more: How to Set Up a MetaMask Wallet  What about hardware wallets?  The above is a survey of the popular web wallets, also known as “hot wallets” because you need an internet connection to use them. Hardware wallets, known as “cold wallets”, are physical devices like USB sticks that you plug into your computer and only connect to the internet when they’re docked. This makes them more secure, albeit a little cumbersome to use. Popular brands include Trezor and Ledger. Unlike hot wallets, you’ll need to buy these hardware wallets from the official suppliers. Purchasing them secondhand or from a non-trusted supplier is incredibly risky as devices could be faulty, tampered with or contain malware.  While cold wallets are considered the absolute safest place to store your crypto as they are entirely offline and cannot be hacked, they also pose a similar risk: If you lose the physical drive and/or the private key, you will be unable to access your crypto. That’s it. No password reset feature, no back button, zilch.  And it’s not just new crypto users that fall foul to forgetting their passwords. Former chief technology officer of Ripple Labs, Stefan Thomas, admitted last year he’d forgotten the password to his crypto wallet containing 7,002 bitcoin (worth approximately $300,000,000 as of March 22, 2022). He has just two guesses remaining before his device auto-encrypts his coins and makes them permanently irretrievable.

Tencent has said it will explore digital yuan payment experiences in the Olympic Village when it opens Jan. 27, according to China Daily’s report.

42375555,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8wlD,1641477603,Nas Selling Rights to Two Songs via Crypto Music Startup Royal,"The rapper Nas plans to sell two of his recent tracks through Royal, the crypto-backed music service he invested in late last year.  The songs – “Ultra Black,” off Nas’ 2020 album “King’s Disease,” and “Rare,” from 2021′s “King’s Disease II” – will be available as “limited digital assets” [LDAs], which the company describes as an “extended version of an NFT.”  Royal’s pitch has to do with selling ownership of individual songs via crypto; buy a token attached to a song, and you’ll receive royalties from its use down the line.  It’s led by Justin Blau, better known as the DJ 3LAU. The son of a hedge fund manager, Blau made a name for himself during the EDM wave of the early 2010s. As an investor and entrepreneur, he’s been heavily involved with crypto for the past few years.  Read more: 3LAU Raises $16M to Tokenize Music Royalties for Artists and Fans  Blau described LDAs as hybridizing smart contracts (which are not legal contracts, and guarantee no rights) with traditional contracts for owning music offline.  “We publish a document that says, this is the legal agreement that we’ve developed with a legal team that allows for these rights to travel with the current owner according to the blockchain,” explained Blau. The LDAs are built on Polygon, a low-fee, eco-friendly spinoff of the Ethereum network.  Nas’ LDAs will be available in three tiers – gold, platinum and diamond – each representing different ownership percentages in the songs. Blau said buyers will also get “additional utility” with each tier, though he declined to say what Nas has in store.  Crypto state of mind  Royal raised $55 million in Series A financing this past November in a round led by the venture capital powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with contributions from Coinbase Ventures, Paradigm and musicians Kygo, Logic and The Chainsmokers. Nas, a longtime crypto investor himself (he won big on Coinbase’s direct listing last year), was also part of the round.  Read more: Rap Icon Nas Could Net $100M When Coinbase Lists on Nasdaq  “Nas wanted to be first,” said Naithan Jones, who left a16z last fall to become Royal’s full-time head of growth. Nas was a connection from Jones’ venture capital days; he and his manager, Anthony Saleh, specifically asked to be the first to drop tokens via Royal when the platform went public.  “That really speaks to Nas as an innovator, as a leader, as someone who really sees that there’s an opportunity for artists and fans alike,” said Jones.  Music IP  Nas also has the advantage of owning the masters for these two singles, which streamlines the process of selling legal ownership through Royal. (Jones said he hasn’t ruled out working with artists who don’t own 100% of their own music, but that it was easier to start with “the least encumbered IP.”)  Royal’s drops are still hand-curated, for now – Blau says he’s readying “an artist a week for the next two months, three months” – but the plan is to open the platform to the public, eventually.  Blau said he’s making a conscious effort to get all kinds of musicians on Royal, some of which might have smaller fan bases, or might not be at all familiar with crypto.  “We really want to show that the product works for everyone, not just the biggest artists,” he explained. “One of the biggest barriers to entry for musicians, as they think about entering the Web 3 ecosystem, is they just don’t know what to do – we’re trying to create a toolkit for artists of all types.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/06/nas-selling-rights-to-two-songs-via-crypto-music-startup-royal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb35bb19230e09f07f14664f9dacbf6123b754d0-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410934,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSol,1641477600,What Really Mattered to Crypto Markets in 2021,"Thanks to 2021, most people have at least heard of crypto by now – not just Bitcoin and Ethereum, but altcoins like DOGE and SHIB, as well as terms like NFTs and the metaverse.  In CoinDesk Research’s 2021 Annual Crypto Review, we aim to summarize some of the key themes and metrics that marked the past year’s progress in cryptocurrency markets.  Read the full CoinDesk Research 2021 Annual Crypto Review here.  As with all financial assets, market performance is usually the first thing that comes to mind when considering a “year in review.” Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, posted gains well in excess of traditional macro assets, gaining 60% and 407%, respectively.  While ether, the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain, still has a way to go before traditional investors begin to form their investment thesis, bitcoin cemented itself in the minds of all professional investors, as it eclipsed $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2021. What’s more, bitcoin also remained uncorrelated with all macro assets, which could make for an interesting value proposition for the asset as managers look to approach their portfolio construction in 2022. That said, bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 ticked up in the fourth quarter, suggesting that investors are trading bitcoin and equities together as risk-on assets.  Bitcoin adoption and tech development  Outside of market performance, 2021 was a big year for Bitcoin from an adoption and technological standpoint. In June, El Salvador announced that bitcoin would become legal tender; that declaration came to fruition in September when a law that stipulated that bitcoin must be accepted as a form of payment everywhere in the country went into effect.  With that came multiple bitcoin purchases by the government, carried out from the president’s cellphone. Meanwhile, a free $30 worth of bitcoin was sent to Salvadorans who signed up to use Chivo, the country’s official bitcoin wallet, and a commitment was made to use the Lightning Network, the commerce layer for Bitcoin (read more here), to enable a more frictionless bitcoin economy. The amount of bitcoin committed to the Lightning Network grew incredibly fast in 2021, injecting renewed life into the digital cash use case for Bitcoin.  2021 also marked the year of an important technological upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol known as Taproot (read more here). Taproot is a bundle of three upgrades that improves network security, privacy and scalability. Taproot is the most significant upgrade to the Bitcoin network since the activation of the block capacity enhancement of Segregated Witness in 2017. Taproot was a reminder that Bitcoin is a technology that can change in order to improve usability and user experience. Taproot’s success in the future will stand as a demonstration that Bitcoin can adapt.  The rise of Ethereum  With ether’s superior asset price performance compared with bitcoin, it’s no surprise that bitcoin dominance, the measure of BTC market capitalization compared with the market capitalization of all digital assets, fell during 2021 from 70.2% to 40.1%. ETH is not the sole reason for bitcoin shedding its dominance; rather, crypto projects have sprung up with many different use cases that are not competing directly with Bitcoin.  Ethereum has had major catalysts from EIP 1559 to the impending transition to proof-of-stake. Both events play important roles not only in the growth of Ethereum as a technology, but also in developing a narrative for Ethereum’s native asset. EIP 1559 solidified ether’s role as “gas” within the ecosystem, demanding that the asset be used and burned in exchange for building on or interacting with the network. The “Merge” to proof-of-stake is an attempt to create a secure, more scalable smart contract network without the need for miners and significant energy consumption.  Ethereum was the catalyst for the initial coin offering boom and bust in 2017/8 and out of the embers came the first wave of decentralized finance (DeFi). During 2019 and 2020, Ethereum-based projects such as Aave (formerly Lend), Compound and Uniswap found their footing. Using the crypto bull market and liquidity mining (token incentives) as fuel, DeFi projects were able to acquire billions of dollars in liquidity for efficient decentralized lending and trading markets.  Ethereum can also credit a sizable portion of its upswing to the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which brought the protocol into the mainstream. NFTs are unique tokens that can act as digital representations of physical items or digitally native items whose proof of ownership can be verified on a public blockchain. As such, NFTs attempt to stand in as the first iteration of digital ownership of collectibles on a blockchain. OpenSea was the darling of the NFT sector in 2021, bringing a digital art marketplace to retail investors.  Capital investment in crypto and DLT companies  Inside the world of institutions and regulation, capital poured into blockchain and crypto companies. According to data from Blockdata, $23 billion of funding reached these companies in 2021, which is more than the total amount raised from 2017 to 2020. We even saw a $1 billion capital raise in December for crypto financial services firm NYDIG, and crypto exchange FTX raised more than $1 billion across two funding rounds.  Crypto regulation  From a regulatory perspective, governments across the world are taking crypto seriously. We have seen China ban bitcoin mining and crypto trading outright. India and Nigeria have tried to do the same. The Bank of England said in a Financial Stability Report that the growth of crypto assets poses a potential threat as it becomes increasingly linked to wider financial networks.  The word “crypto” even echoed in the halls of Congress as a $1 trillion infrastructure bill was held up in part due to a crypto tax-reporting provision. Regulators’ involvement in and discussion of crypto is indicative of the widespread belief that crypto is here to stay and therefore should be regulated to “keep citizens safe.”  Overall, 2021 was an extraordinary year for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.

The San Francisco-based company, which provides financing and payments services for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), received $20 million in Stellar USDC from SDF and $20 million in fiat from PFG, Tribal’s chief strategy officer Mohamed Elkasstawi told CoinDesk.  The integration of USDC into the Tribal ecosystem is intended to provide SMBs with “cheaper, easier and faster access to capital,” Elkasstawi said, noting that Tribal’s customers will not be provided financing in crypto.  According to Elkasstawi, SMBs based in emerging markets have difficulty accessing capital, with interest rates ranging from 20% to 200% a year, while crypto offers “much easier access to capital,” with rates between 10% and 50%.  Elkasstawi added that stablecoins are growing at a rapid pace but are mainly used in the crypto space, rather than in traditional finance. “One of the great use cases of blockchain is cheaper access to capital. In order to reach that use case, we are building the infrastructure to connect the crypto industry with traditional finance,” he said.  Tribal provides SMBs with payment methods such as physical and virtual business credit cards, short-term financing, local and international wires and a management platform to control expenses, according to Elkasstawi.  The company plans to launch crypto-related products in 2022, Elkasstawi said, without revealing details. In December 2021, it launched a cross-border B2B payment service between Mexico and the U.S. in partnership with SDF and Latin American crypto exchange Bitso.  According to Duane Good, chief operating officer of Tribal, the round will help Tribal fund SMBs’ receivables in the markets where it operates – Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru. In Latin America, the company plans to expand into Argentina, and the company is also considering expanding into Africa, Europe and South Asia in the future, Elkasstawi added.  In April 2021, Tribal closed a combined Series A and debt round totaling $34.3 million, in which SDF contributed $3 million, the company said in a statement.  “World Bank data shows SMBs in emerging markets create seven out of 10 jobs, yet the lack of access to financing is regularly cited as a major barrier to SMB growth,” said Denelle Dixon, CEO and executive director of SDF, in a statement. “Tribal’s rapid expansion is another indicator of how much SMBs in emerging market economies want and need additional financial services options.”",POSITIVE,USDC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | USDC,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/06/b2b-payments-platform-tribal-raises-debt-round-including-20m-in-stellar-usdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7811868fe83d53ed13acfdd1e69ff17831cd6cb2-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411570,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOsre,1641477000,An Advisor’s Guide to Altcoin Investing,"While 2021 was certainly the year of bitcoin, investors with a particular type of risk appetite are diversifying their crypto portfolios with altcoins.  The term “altcoin” is short for “alternative coin” and refers to cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. Ether is perhaps the most popular altcoin, though crypto insiders quickly bring up other names like the bitcoin copycat litecoin, the stablecoin tether and, of course, dogecoin, the meme coin popularized by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  In total, there are more than 15,000 cryptocurrencies, according to the crypto market data website CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin makes up about 40% of the market, and ether makes up roughly another 20%. That leaves the remaining market share – some 40% – composed of other altcoins.  Just like purchasing individual stocks, investing in altcoins requires research and knowing the crypto market well. Ahead are some insights from crypto industry insiders that explain what factors to consider when investing in altcoins.  Altcoins and regulation  One of the first questions that inevitably pops up when discussing altcoins is that of regulation.  In a recent panel at DeFiCon, a blockchain event in Brooklyn, N.Y., American Blockchain Initiative CEO and founder Alex Allaire explained that regulation is a top priority for legislators and governmental agencies alike.  “More awareness comes with more scrutiny,” he said, noting that government officials have begun to prioritize cryptocurrency discussions more now that bitcoin and alts have reached a level of widespread familiarity.  From a national security perspective, there’s real urgency to decide on clear guidelines for stablecoins in particular, Conor Carney, legislative director for Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY.), said during the same panel discussion.  Stablecoins are altcoins that are pegged to a form of fiat currency (commonly the U.S. dollar) and work all over the world. According to Carney, stablecoins could provide a way for the U.S. dollar to retain its global trading power as more countries around the world create digital forms of their national currencies, known as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).  Yet stablecoin regulation is a hot-button issue that will definitely affect public sentiment. Both Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have been critical of stablecoins in the past. Last summer, Powell said the U.S. wouldn’t need stablecoins if the country instead opted for a CBDC.  But Carney argued against Powell’s stance: Other countries are developing their own CBDC at a faster rate than the U.S., which could be an issue for both national security and global trade, he said.  “The United States, given the way we finance our budget every year with a deficit, is very reliant upon the U.S. dollar being the global reserve currency,” Carney said. “The only way for that to happen considering there are other nations, including China, who are moving forward with CBDCs at a faster pace, is to make sure that stablecoins and the private issuers that are issuing them in the United States with U.S.-backed assets are the reserve assets for those currencies.”  The U.S. stands to lose a lot of its global influence, Carney said, if it doesn’t invest in the development of stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars or assets that are denominated in U.S. dollars.  Altcoin investors therefore might argue that now is the perfect time to look into buying stablecoins such as tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC.  Reading market sentiment  If sentiment is low around a particular altcoin you’re interested in, that may be a good sign, argues Light Node Media co-founder and CEO, Nelson Merchan Jr.  The principle of “buy low, sell high” applies to altcoins just like it does in the traditional stock market. According to Merchan, when buzz hits social media about a new blockchain project or altcoin, you should do your due diligence while the project has its 15 minutes of fame and wait to buy when the sentiment is down.  “When the market is really hot, you see a lot of buzz and a lot of hype that enables you to come up with a list of the most promising ones,” Merchan says.  Use every newsworthy altcoin headline as a sign to stop to think about the future. Imagine a world in six months or a few years that needs or wants a particular project, altcoin or blockchain solution.  For instance, blockchain privacy and data sovereignty is a burgeoning area of need, Merchan says. Investors could consider buying utility tokens of projects they believe have legs and lasting value. Or on the gaming side, you can look at which decentralized finance (DeFi) gaming communities might be taking off in the foreseeable future and then buy altcoins for that system.  “When the market corrects, similar to how it did in the last few weeks, a lot of these gaming, crypto protocols dropped 40% to 50%, so that significantly drops the sentiment, and then people slowly stop talking about or most of them,” Merchan says. “So the whole idea is, where is the narrative for gaming? Has it hit a peak? Is it going to? Will it bounce back or recover? Or are we going to see a pretty significant bear run?”  Use case and community strength  Finally, any good crypto project demonstrates its worth by the engagement of its community. After all, the number of buyers and sellers is what drives liquidity in any market, and the same holds true for altcoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  The way to measure community-wide adoption of an altcoin is to evaluate what industry insiders refer to as “use case,” or the ways you can use, apply, redeem and exchange your crypto.  Meme coins are perhaps the most obvious altcoin example of community buy-in. When most meme coins drop, they are worth little or nothing and, ironically, have little to no use case. But through social media and celebrity influencers, their value may rise and create new uses for them where there were never any before. Dogecoin is a perfect example of that phenomena.  Ryan Fochtman, a strategic partnerships manager at MoneyMade, says he dabbles in altcoins in his off-hours from work. Using a portion of his personal portfolio devoted to what he considers his play money, Fochtman buys into coins with a healthy understanding that they may not bring a return on investment. But when they do, it’s because of community buy-in, he says.  “There’s this new wave of technology using these alternative coins and crypto in general to buy everyday items,” says Fochtman. “Now AMC accepts crypto for tickets now. The more use cases that we can get out of these coins is going to be just a better overall fun space and bring them more mainstream.”  And that’s not even counting the metaverse and virtual real estate projects like Decentraland. Utility tokens for Decentraland are surging in value as corporate brands such as Adidas and Nike express interest in buying digital land.  “I really like the whole Decentraland and meta-universe that everyone’s been talking about,” Fochtman says. A big part of Fochtman’s due diligence is trying to think ahead and consider which coins are going to be the most used by people.  “I think the whole crypto space is just evolving and becoming more and more intelligent,” Fochtman says. “I think that these altcoins are just going to be a part of it all.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/06/an-advisors-guide-to-altcoin-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3044192dbf98c5ec03b5e14472b01f2d274f95d7-3977x2983.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411565,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOsUV,1641477000,Lessons I’ve Learned About Crypto as an Advisor,"In my previous articles for this newsletter, I’ve highlighted many of the conversations you will have to have with clients and prospects as you add crypto and digital assets to your practice.  This article is going to be a little more personal. I’ll be taking you down some of the roads I’ve traveled in my crypto journey, so that you can learn from some of my mistakes and successes and impart that knowledge and experience to your practice.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Where I’ve been  Let’s start with my personal journey into crypto. It all began in the fall of 2017, when my partner talked me into buying some crypto for the first time. I opened a Coinbase account, with all the frustrations that come with the know-your-customer (KYC)/anti-money-laundering (AML) process. I was then shocked to learn there was more than just bitcoin. In my naivete, I first purchased ether, with the rationale that bitcoin had already run to over $5,000, so surely this other cryptocurrency I knew nothing about would see the same growth.  Since crypto is a 24/7/365 market, I checked my Coinbase account approximately every 15 seconds. I’d wake up in the middle of the night and check. First thing in the morning, I’d check prices. Waiting at a red light, time to check prices. I had no idea what I invested in, or why the price was moving, but I liked that it was easy.  My next step was trading crypto on a few exchanges. In this scenario, I had to again go through KYC, but these exchanges weren’t based in the U.S. I was trading any number of cryptocurrencies, most of which I knew nothing about, against bitcoin, with the goal to accumulate more bitcoin.  Since I knew very little about all these cryptocurrencies, or about trading any sort of asset, I started joining Telegram groups – now commonly referred to as “pump-and-dump groups.” I actually wasn’t aware that I was part of something that nefarious. I would read the updates, again, at all times of day and night, and try to make the appropriate trades.  I was usually either late to the trade, and ended up buying near the top, or was too greedy to get out at the appropriate time, giving back all of my gains. Through this process, I did learn trading techniques like support and resistance, relative strength index (RSI), stop loss, take profit.  Seeing all those cryptocurrencies I was trading was the impetus to send me down the proverbial rabbit hole, learning all I could about Bitcoin, blockchain technology, custody, and many of the developments we would later refer to as decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3. This is when I really got hooked on this technology.  While my partner and I tried to determine how we could make money consulting, we found that I was better at educating people about crypto, blockchain and digital assets, and we started our YouTube channel in mid-2019. We focused on helping people more easily understand the technology and the new systems that were being built, with a bent on how crypto, DeFi, and blockchain would affect finances, businesses and lives.  Since that time, I have tried several different wallets, investing in at least 100 different tokens, yield farming and NFTs. Some I have done as a matter of better understanding the process, protocol or opportunity. Some I have researched and really liked the mid- to long-term growth possibilities. And some I have just “aped in” to try to make some quick money.  I have bought too late and sold too early … and then sold too late. I’ve definitely been a victim of a “fear of missing out” (FOMO), and continue to struggle with that. I’ve been scammed, nearly scammed and hacked.  I’ve also had some great successes in terms of gains from investments, and gains from knowledge and understanding, along with the growth of the network I’ve been able to grow and maintain.  From all that experience, good and bad, I’ve broken out a few items to keep in mind when investing in crypto and when advising others.  1. Don’t look for quick bucks.  I tried trading thinking I could make money quickly, exploiting others who weren’t as smart as I am. They’re smarter, and they are waiting for people like me.  Those who are good at trading crypto, or any other asset, have a different skill and a different motive than investors. Most of us are not going to be able to time any market and will get hurt in the process. Best to leave the trading – and the trading sites, social media feeds and YouTube channels – to those who are part of that profit motive.  2. Get educated.  The best way to invest, and to help others invest in a new technology and infrastructure, is to understand it. Once I better understood how bitcoin works and how a few other cryptocurrencies work, I was able to resist many of the temptations to ape into certain tokens or to sell prematurely because of what seemed like bad news.  3. Have an investing plan.  This is the crux of why advisors need to learn about crypto – so that they can help clients develop a plan. Everyone is going to have a different risk tolerance, set of goals and needs and lifestyle.  I had to have some plans in place for the amount of money I would risk on a project I was researching, versus one I really saw a long-term benefit in. I also decided when I would feel like my investment theses had been overturned. This is based on my comfort level with the technology, my own risk appetite and the time I had to devote.  For example, I decided that I would put a few hundred dollars into a new project that had a good team, but hadn’t had the smart contracts audited. I wouldn’t rush to pull my money out if the value went down quickly if I believed in the team. I will sell part when I’ve doubled my money and let the rest ride.  For more established protocols, I’m willing to invest more, but expect a lower return. I also have an idea what should affect the value and know what can cause that value to drop.  4. I’m not going to catch everything.  When I started learning about crypto, it was all crypto. Then crypto branched into DeFi as well. Then we added non-fungible tokens and now decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).  Each new strain has added more multimillionaires, seemingly overnight, and from inauspicious beginnings. The proverbial DoorDash delivery person into an eight-figure crypto venture capitalist within weeks.  I have to be comfortable with the fact that each of these subgroups of crypto is actually an entire investing ecosystem unto itself, with experts, value drivers, scammers and profit motives. I can’t possibly be an excellent investor in all these areas, and so I shouldn’t try to invest in them all. This is such a hard lesson, watching so many others become instantly set for life.  5. Security and safety are key.  The nature of cryptocurrency, with its self-custody, makes the security of my assets a priority for me. I’ve chosen to keep more of my assets in some digital form – crypto or stablecoins – so that I can earn more.  I have had to really work to create a security and safety plan, along with an estate plan. Since so much of our wealth is tied to crypto, I’ve had to also educate my wife about how to access our assets and how to keep them safe.  This is going to be an incredibly important conversation and a source of value you’re going to be able to offer clients.  6. Conviction is also important.  So many times in the past few years, I wish I had the conviction to stay with certain tokens and investments through a downturn. I’ve realized that all those people who turn into millionaires seemingly overnight due to a meteoric rise in the value of their crypto assets usually had to suffer through some time when it seemed their investment was worthless.  I did the research and found projects I liked investing in, but too often, I decided to bail when it seemed it wouldn’t take off. Often I was also following my FOMO, and moving those funds to the hot crypto investment. Many times I would lose on both sides.  As part of my investment theses, I’ve marked the few projects I have conviction in, whether they are going up or down. The only way I’ll sell those early is if something materially changes my thesis or the valuation I see of the investment.  Summary  I realize that this article sounds like one long cautionary tale, but the point is to really to look at crypto, DeFi and digital asset investments as you would just about any other investment you choose to make. Do your research. Form a plan. Stick to your plan. Trust yourself.  As the advisor, you’ll have to help clients with their education and research. You’ll also have to create and follow plans best suited for both your clients’ crypto and overall portfolios.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Adam Blumberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/06/lessons-ive-learned-about-crypto-as-an-advisor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/043d69233df5a14aaeea3a5accb63cd5f12adc48-4536x3027.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bank of America, in a note on Thursday, cited increasing signs of revenue diversification beyond just retail crypto trading, a trend that it thinks will accelerate this year.  The bank forecasts subscription and services revenue will increase to 16% of Coinbase’s total revenue in 2023 from 12% in the third quarter of 2021.  The trend will be driven by a combination of offerings such as staking, earn campaign, Coinbase’s non-fungible token platform and decentralized finance products such as DeFi yield, the report said.  Scaling of these non-trading revenue streams could also lead to increased interest in the stock from institutional investors, Bank of America noted.  Uncertainty around regulation remains a potential risk, but Coinbase’s “technology/innovation and brand are positive differentiators,” the report added.

42411864,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgiV0,1641475773,Why Use Bitcoin?,"Satoshi Nakamoto originally created bitcoin as an alternative, decentralized payment method. Unlike international bank transfers, it was low-cost and almost instantaneous.  You’ve probably heard that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and all the hype around them as being the “future of finance.” The primary philosophy behind Bitcoin was to create an electronic payment system that would not rely on a third party or central authority for confirmation, settlement or issuance.  In addition to eliminating third parties, bitcoin transactions were touted as being irreversible, immutable and relatively cheaper than traditional payment options. Compared to fiat currencies that are controlled by the government, Bitcoin is public and operates independently of any state entity. Transactions are digitally verified through a type of ledger technology known as a blockchain that isn’t bound to one central server, but rather to a global network of computers. This makes bitcoin transactions significantly less vulnerable to fraud or chargebacks.  Imagine waking up one morning to a closed PayPal account because the company claims there has been some fraudulent activity involving your account. That cannot happen in a decentralized setting because your funds are not controlled by a centralized entity. Similarly, the government of your country cannot shut down the blockchain because it is not hosted on a single server or in a single location.  These features are particularly beneficial to online merchants and allow consumers to enjoy a wider selection of domestic and international markets without worrying about high fees or geographical restrictions. Moreover, bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, meaning they offer users some degree of anonymity when trading or exchanging funds.  Bitcoin for cross border remittance  To an extent, Bitcoin also addresses the problems with the current model of remittance, particularly the issues of price and speed. Traditional remittance services typically charge exorbitant fees and transfers may take several days to get to their destinations. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not only faster, but also much cheaper. This is because the Bitcoin network does not rely on any intermediary to confirm transactions. There is a network of voluntary contributors all over the world that are running their computing equipment 24/7 to confirm bitcoin transactions.  It takes about 10 minutes for a BTC payment to be confirmed. This can be lower or higher, depending on how congested the Bitcoin network is. The more people using the network at any given time, the longer it takes to process a transaction and vice versa. You can think of it like traffic on a motorway. The busier it is, the longer it takes for each car to reach its destination.  Bitcoin has proven to be a more efficient and cheaper way to transfer money across borders. For instance, according to the World Bank, the global average cost of sending a $200 remittance in the third quarter of 2020 was 6.82%. That can become quite significant for higher figures. Whereas, the average transaction fee of the Bitcoin network is currently around $2.67. That is why countries like El Salvador have made the cryptocurrency a legally recognized form of money.  In general, Bitcoin is decentralized and gives people the freedom to exchange value without relying on intermediaries. And thanks to the institutional boom of 2020 and 2021, many traditional companies now accept bitcoin as payments.  A store of value  Away from its use as a medium of exchange, bitcoin has earned itself the title of “digital gold” because of its scarcity and potential use as an economic or inflation hedge – a type of asset purchased to protect against an economic crisis or decreasing currency value (respectively.)  Just like gold, which has a finite supply, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million tokens. So far, 18.9 million Bitcoin tokens have been mined. For this reason, many traders, institutional investors, and small-time savers have woken up to the potential gains from bitcoin’s price appreciation because there are only 2.1 million left to enter circulation.  It’s estimated there are just over 20 million millionaires in the world, meaning there’s just enough for each to own a single BTC, notwithstanding the rest of the world’s population.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,"Noelle Acheson, Hoa Nguyen, John Biggs",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/why-use-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18b6ae4ff3e13f2329886f43394ada97c75cdc57-1885x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375557,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8woz,1641475514,Crypto Crime Hit All-Time High of $14B in 2021 as Prices Climbed: Chainalysis,"Crypto crime accounted for a record-setting $14 billion worth of blockchain transactions in 2021, according to a new report from blockchain research firm Chainalysis. The value of illicit transactions in 2021 was nearly double 2020′s figure of $7.8 billion in criminal blockchain activity.  But despite the precipitous rise in criminal activity by total volume, 2021′s figures are significant for another reason: When examined as a percentage of overall crypto transactions last year, criminal activity hit an all-time low.  The crypto market exploded in 2021, and total transaction volume grew by more than 550% to reach $15.8 trillion. According to Chainalysis’ report, criminal activity accounted for 0.15% of all blockchain transactions last year – down 75% from 2020 and down nearly 96% from 2019.  “We had an explosion in the amount of on-chain activity [in 2021],” Kim Grauer, Chainalysis’ head of research, told CoinDesk. “It’s just that the amount of crime didn’t grow as fast as the amount of legitimate use cases.”  Rug pulls and DeFi scams  Grauer and her team attribute the growth in volume of both scams and legitimate crypto transactions to the explosion in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Scams accounted for the lion’s share of crime in 2021, rising 82% to reach $7.8 billion. According to Chainalysis’ report, nearly $3 million of that total came from rug pulls, which are an increasingly popular crypto scam where developers build legitimate-looking projects, load their pockets and then disappear.  Read more: After ‘Stealing’ $16M, This Teen Hacker Seems Intent on Testing ‘Code Is Law’ in the Courts  Aside from rug pulls, Grauer told CoinDesk that DeFi platforms were used for money laundering and were targeted by hackers for large-scale theft.  “DeFi services were hacked at rates that we’ve never seen before. Not only are people using DeFi to carry out crime, they’re also targeting DeFi for crime,” Grauer said, adding:  “DeFi platform protocols are hacked very often because it’s a new industry and a lot of the code is open-source, so people can look at the code and see vulnerabilities.”  In 2021, $2.2 billion worth of crypto was stolen from DeFi protocols – accounting for about two-thirds of all crypto stolen last year, and a 516% increase from 2020′s figures.  Does law enforcement deter?  Last year saw an uptick in law enforcement actions taken against bad actors in the crypto sector, as government agencies turn their attention to crypto crime.  The Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation Unit reported seizing $3.5 billion in crypto last year, $1 billion of which was tied to the darknet marketplace Silk Road.  The U.S. Department of Justice successfully recovered most of the bitcoin ransom from last year’s ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline.  Read more: Teenage Suspect in $16M DeFi Hack Wanted for Arrest in Canada  Similar trends were seen in government agencies around the world: Australian police busted more than 300 crime syndicates in 2021 and seized “over $48 million in various worldwide currencies and cryptocurrencies,” and law enforcement in the U.K. seized millions in crypto from criminals.  “We’ve seen law enforcement stepping in and stepping up to take on the challenge of tracking down crypto crime across the board,” Grauer told CoinDesk.  “There have been major law enforcement actions that have put a deterrent signal out to people,” she said. “Maybe what felt like a crime you might have been able to get away with in the past – maybe you’re a little bit more reluctant now.”  The year ahead  Law enforcement actions against malicious crypto actors show no signs of slowing: IRS Criminal Investigation Chief Jim Lee told reporters in November that he expected the trend of crypto seizures to continue in 2022.  And as government agencies continue to sign contracts with blockchain research providers like Chainalysis and Coinbase, they are increasingly building the skills and adding the tools needed to go after blockchain criminals.  Grauer noted, however, that bad actors are usually faster than law enforcement in adapting to new technologies.  “Criminals are quick to learn about a new potential solution to laundering money, and then lean in and take advantage of that,” Grauer said.  Despite law enforcement beefing up, scamming isn’t going anywhere.  “When you have a lot of competing new projects, it’s impossible to do your due diligence on all of them,” Grauer explained. “People are treating [investing] like a roulette table, and so I think that means there will be a lot of opportunities for people to get scammed.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/crypto-crime-hit-an-all-time-high-of-14b-in-2021-as-prices-climbed-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7e72c809f45c24d9a14897fb422b91e9773afac-5180x3453.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the development of blockchain technology, a number of Web3.0 related projects have emerged. According to the Web3 Index compiled by web3index.org (a website that tracks protocol usage across the entire Web3 stack), in the past 30 days, the revenue and other comprehensive indexes of Pocket Network, Arweave, and Livepeer ranked among the top relative to other projects. Pocket Network is currently the Number 1 middleware, with its 30-day revenue more than 30 times that of Arweave. In November, the fees paid by developers increased by 208%. In the Web1.0 era, the transmission of information was one-way, without interaction on the user&apos;s side. Web2.0 gave users the right to edit, use, and interact with information. However, privacy protection remained an issue, and the value of user participation wasn&apos;t explored.

The final phase of the sharding, which is crucial for scaling the network, won’t arrive before next year, the bank’s strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in the note published on Wednesday.  Full scaling is at least a year away and the risk is that during that time, the Ethereum network will continue to lose market share to competing networks, the bank warned.  Alternative blockchains such as Terra, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana, Fantom, Tron and Polygon have been gaining the most market share in the DeFi market, and those competitors have received a lot of funding and have set up incentives to increase usage in their own systems, JPMorgan said.  The risk with Ethereum is that by the time sharding is implemented other ecosystems would have grown by so much that activity won’t return en masse to the Ethereum network, the bank noted.  Ethereum’s share of total value locked in DeFi has fallen from almost 100% at the start of 2021 to around 70% and will likely drop further before sharding is implemented in 2023, the report added.  Last month, Bank of America said that smart contract Avalanche is a credible alternative to Ethereum for DeFi projects, non-fungible tokens, gaming and other assets.

Didar Bekbau, a co-founder of Kazakh mining firm Xive, tweeted yesterday: “no internet, no mining,” and Norway-based researcher Jaran Mellerud confirmed to CoinDesk that it is next to impossible to mine without the internet.  Top mining pools had lost an average of 10% of their hashrate in 24 hours as of 6 a.m. UTC, according to data from pool BTC.com. The hashrate measures computing power on the bitcoin mining network.  Kazakhstan is second only to the U.S. in bitcoin mining hashrate, with about one-fifth of the global total according to August data from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.  “It looks like the internet connection is down in all of Kazakhstan,” Alan Dordjiev, head of the Kazakh National Association of Blockchain and Data Center Industry, told CoinDesk on Thursday. “Therefore none of the farms are able to connect to the mining pools.”  Bitmain’s platform BitFuFu said at around 3 a.m. UTC today that mines in Kazakhstan were facing disruptions with network connectivity and electricity and that it was trying to connect to local staff.  Internet watchdog NetBlocks reported that internet connectivity in Kazakhstan is still almost nonexistent. Connectivity was initially lost at around noon UTC Wednesday. “Metrics indicate a simultaneous loss of connectivity affecting multiple providers, which could indicate the use of a centralized kill-switch,” NetBlocks told CoinDesk in a Twitter message.  The internet was briefly and partially restored during Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s speech a few hours later, according to NetBlocks, when he asked Russia and its allies to help Kazakhstan tackle what he called a “terrorist threat.”  Protests erupted in the southern city of Zhanaozhen over a hike in the price of liquefied petroleum gas, commonly used to power cars, which took effect over the weekend.  Kazakhstan’s electricity grid has been under strain in the last few months. That’s in part because of increased demand from crypto miners, but also because of failures of coal plants and other infrastructure-related issues.  The protests spread to Almaty, the former capital and largest city by population, and devolved into the worst riots the country has seen since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, according to international media. Yesterday, protesters reportedly broke into the mayor’s building amid widespread looting.  Dozens of protesters and 12 police officers have been killed, the Associated Press reported.

42396264,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1yTW,1641458841,"Polkadot, Solana Biggest Losers Among Top Cryptos","Top cryptocurrencies saw deep losses in the past 24 hours as bitcoin (BTC) fell to as low as $42,700 after losing a major support level of $46,500, causing a sell-off in the broader altcoin market.  Among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, tokens of Ethereum rivals Avalanche (AVAX), Terra (LUNA) and Solana (SOL) – the so-termed ‘SoLunAvax’ trade – fell as much as 12% in the past 24 hours. Polkadot (DOT), another Ethereum rival, saw its tokens fall by 14% before seeing a slight revival during Asian trading hours on Thursday.  Tokens of those networks have risen several hundred percent in the past year, mainly as investors looked for blockchain alternatives outside of Ethereum.  DOT found support at the $25 price level, one that has previously acted as resistance, and gained $1.26 at the time of writing. Falling under these prices could mean a drop to just over $20, where the next support exists.  SOL fell from the support level of $167 to $144 during Asian trading hours on Thursday, temporarily reaching prices last seen in October. The $130-$140 range remains crucial for SOL, according to the charts. If it falls below that range, SOL could drop to $78 if previous resistance levels are considered.  LUNA, which surged from $50 at the start of December to a high of $103 later in the month, continued the downtrend it has experienced during the past two weeks. Prices were at support levels of $75 during Asian trading hours on Thursday, and dropping below the support could trigger a fall to nearly $50.  Crypto markets seemed to stabilize at the time of writing as BTC prices hovered above the $43,000 level. Readings on the relative strength index (RSI) – a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of price changes – dropped under the 30 level on several top cryptos, suggesting most assets were oversold after the sell-off and could see a brief upward rally.  The price drop was caused by the over $800 million in crypto liquidations, as reported. Slightly over 87% of these liquidations were on short positions, or from traders who bet on falling prices.  Liquidations occur when traders borrow funds from exchanges to bet on crypto prices using a relatively small initial capital, one that is forfeited when prices reach a predetermined liquidation level. Over $317 million worth of liquidations occurred on BTC-tracked futures products in the past 24 hours alone.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOT | SOL,BTC | DOT | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/06/polkadot-solana-biggest-losers-among-top-cryptos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dba52f3e1e517d14523351be37b8214308e0535-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin fell to as low as $42,500 in Asian trading hours on Thursday morning after trading above $47,000 on Wednesday. Traders took on $317 million worth of losses on bitcoin-tracked futures alone, with 87% of those positions betting on upward price movements.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.  A drop in bitcoin prices led to altcoin markets seeing deep cuts. More than 200,000 positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with a bulk of the losses coming during the U.S. trading hours.  Over 87% of the $800 million in liquidations occurred on long positions, which are futures contracts in which traders bet on a price rise. Crypto exchange OKEx saw $241 million in liquidations, the most among major exchanges, while traders on the Binance exchange took on $236 million in losses.  Futures on ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, saw over $164 million in liquidations. Altcoin traders saw relatively smaller losses, with Solana (SOL) and XRP traders seeing $18 million and $16 million in losses respectively.  Open interest – the total number of unsettled futures or derivatives – across crypto futures fell 8% following the move, implying traders exited their positions seeing weakening market conditions.  Wednesday’s plunge came shortly after the release of the minutes of the December meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).

The date and witness list for the hearing are still undetermined, but it could take place as early as the end of January, The Block reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The Oversight and Investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee is drawing up a list of witnesses. They will be questioned about the energy use of proof-of-work mining, the type of mining used for bitcoin, according to the report.  In 2021, as bitcoin’s carbon footprint was taking up headlines, U.S. companies continued to pour millions of dollars into bitcoin mining infrastructure. Chinese miners fleeing a regulatory crackdown also made investments in the U.S., which is now the world’s largest bitcoin miner. Mining firms plan to continue expanding their capacity over the next year.  In December, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to New York-based miner Greenidge’s CEO, expressing concerns about the firm’s environmental impact.

42396258,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1yNc,1641440892,Singapore Tycoons’ Sons Plan Private NFT Club: Report,"A son of a Singapore financier and a son of the family that started Mewah International Inc., an edible oils company, have founded ARC, a private, NFT-based social networking app that will be open to anyone who owns their non-fungible token, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. They plan to eventually create an “ARC metaverse,” a huge virtual community that includes a gaming element.  Kiat Lim, 28, the son of financier Peter Lim, and Elroy Cheo, 37, of the family that started Mewah, told Bloomberg that ARC’s app-based community will connect people from Taiwan to South Korea and Australia to network, collaborate on projects and share stories.  The next step will be to host exclusive member events, and then create the ARC metaverse with the gaming element. ARC will charge an annual subscription fee to those who choose not to own ARC’s NFTs.  “We are a networking ecosystem that encompasses online and offline experiences, and pushing online boundaries,” Lim told Bloomberg.  The scions are among the latest of the well-to-do who are jumping into the NFT phenomenon. Paris Hilton in April launched her first NFT drop on Nifty Gateway, for which she has collaborated with Blake Kathryn, an acclaimed digital artist.  Lim and Cheo began work on their startup before the coronavirus pandemic started. The app works only on iPhones now, but an Android version is being tested.  “ARC” partly expresses the founders’ goal to bridge the real and virtual worlds and the transition to Web 3.  “We want to create a community that Asia has never seen before,” Cheo told Bloomberg. “We saw the world change a lot, especially after Covid. People in this target segment now all want a sense of belonging.”  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA,Greg Ahlstrand,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/singapore-tycoons-sons-plan-private-nft-club-that-will-become-an-arc-to-the-metaverse-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59e8f86be8106513323fe3c977d1f4e8844c1adc-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396263,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1yRY,1641433813,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Falls Below $44K After Fed Minutes Release,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin slipped to below $44,000 after Fed minutes release, altcoins followed.  Technician’s take: BTC broke below $45K support intraday; short-term oversold indicators intact.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC) $43,423 -5.87%  Ether (ETH) $3,528 -7.4%  Markets  S&P 500: 4,700 -1.94%  DJIA: 36,407 -1.07%  Nasdaq: 15.100 -3.34%  Gold: $1,810 -0.19%  Market Moves  Bitcoin fell below $44,000, after a Federal Reserve official in the U.S. implied a high level of discomfort with high inflation during the Fed’s meeting in December, according to minutes of the meeting that were released on Wednesday.  At the time of writing, bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, was trading at $43,423, down by 5.87% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data.  Data from TradingView and Coinbase shows that after minutes were released at 19:00 UTC on Wednesday, bitcoin fell 2.73% to $44,500 on the hourly chart.  “Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated,” according to the Dec. 14-15 meeting minutes. “Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate.”  As CoinDesk reported previously, bitcoin and traditional risk assets would potentially face price pressure if the minutes signal an internal debate on raising rates and starting the balance sheet contraction along with the end of asset purchases in March.  Even though bitcoin is viewed by some as a hedge against inflation, it is also an emerging technology, and so it is sensitive to a tightened monetary policy – similar to the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.  S&P 500 and Nasdaq both slipped after the Fed minutes release, while U.S. Treasurys also sold off as yields on 10-year Treasurys rose.  Other cryptocurrencies also followed the sell-off. Ether was down by 2.51% to $3,644.44 in the hour after the minutes release, based on the hourly chart on TradingView. The loss came after the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose as high as almost $3,900 during early U.S. trading hours on Wednesday.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin below $45K Support  BTC has broken below $45,000, which was the bottom of a monthlong price range. It remains to be seen if buyers will enter on the dip given persistent oversold signals on the daily chart.  For now, upside momentum continues to slow, which means short-term buying could be limited at below $50,000. There is strong resistance ahead, which defined a downtrend from the November all-time high of around $69,000. Sellers remain in control.  Lower support is seen at around $40,000-$42,000, a range bitcoin hit during its crash in early December.  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here are the most recent episodes of “First Mover” on CoinDesk TV:  Risk and Opportunity for Algorithmic Stablecoin, The Case for BlockbusterDAO  “First Mover” hosts spoke to Harvard Business School professor Marco Di Maggio about the risk and opportunity for algorithmic stablecoins.
