42387618,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlvQj,1550607313,Countdown Restarts Today for SEC Decision on CBOE-VanEck Bitcoin ETF,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may make an initial decision on not one, but two different bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETFs) proposals by April 5.  A bitcoin ETF proposal submitted (for a second time) by VanEck, SolidX and the Cboe BZX Exchange is expected to be formally published in the Federal Register Wednesday, kicking off the initial 45-day clock for approval, rejection or extension. The proposal was first posted on the SEC's website on Feb. 13.  Once the proposal is officially published, the general public will have three weeks from Feb. 20 (meaning until March 13) to file their initial responses to it. Then the SEC will have another three weeks, until April 5, to make a decision or give itself an extension.  At the moment, the proposal appears in the Public Inspection section of the Federal Register website, meaning it has not yet been officially published. As the current page notes, ""only official editions of the Federal Register provide legal notice to the public and judicial notice to the courts,"" while the most recent version of the proposal itself says that it is scheduled to be published Wednesday.  The VanEck/SolidX proposal will join one filed by Bitwise Investment Management and NYSE Arca, which was published in the Federal Register on Feb. 15, meaning the SEC has until the beginning of April to decide on it or postpone the decision.  The VanEck/SolidX proposal was previously filed last year, and was widely expected to be the first proposal to be approved by the U.S. securities regulator. However, this proposal was withdrawn during the longest U.S. government shutdown in history and re-filed at the end of January.  If approved, an ETF could potentially bring new liquidity into a bitcoin market that is starting to show signs of recovery. However, it's important to remember that the SEC can give itself up to three extensions on any rule change proposal, meaning it could still be months before a final decision is reached on either ETF.  Early feedback  While the formal comment period has not officially opened yet, the VanEck/SolidX proposal is already receiving feedback.  The filing's first response, listed as from Sam Ahn at Hana Trading, asks how the companies are defining bitcoin's intrinsic value. The question of intrinsic value is important for investors who may consider buying into the ETF, Ahn explains.  Ahn's response links to seven previous responses on different ETF proposals, all of which also question bitcoin's intrinsic value.  Gabor Gurbacs, VanEck's digital asset strategy lead, declined to comment on this response.  Correction (03:50 UTC, Feb. 20, 2019): This article previously said the Bitwise proposal was filed last year. The VanEck/SolidX proposal was first filed in 2018.

42430222,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpChh,1550605498,Funds in Short Positions on Bitcoin Drop to 6-Month Low,"The amount of money allocated to short bets against bitcoin fell to a more than 6-month low during Tuesday’s trading session, data from the popular cryptocurrency trading platform Bitfinex reveals.  At 13:00 UTC today, the total funding in BTC shorts, or positions that would profit from a decline in the price of the underlying bitcoin asset, fell beyond the recent low of 18,992 BTC set this past November to reach 18,888 BTC - the lowest amount seen since Aug. 4, 2018.  The development comes a day after bitcoin’s price increased 8 percent, which likely trapped investors with a bearish outlook on the wrong side of the market, causing them to cover a large number of short positions.  Current figures show a 28 percent drop in the amount of funds in bitcoin shorts since the beginning of the day yesterday.  Interestingly, bullish bets on Bitfinex, known as “longs,” have also witnessed a sharp decline in the past 48 hours.  Data from Bitfinex further reveals the amount of BTC/USD longs have dropped by a similar 29 percent from yesterday’s high, which is likely a sign of investors are deleveraging, or taking profit after bitcoin’s near 18 percent price increase over the past 11 days.  As it stands, the ratio of long to short positions is 1.42 to 1, meaning there are 1.42 BTC in a long position per every 1 BTC is a short position on Bitfinex. The ratio is a slight decline from the most recent high of 1.54 to 1 set on Feb. 15.  As previous analysis from CoinDesk notes, an unusually high long/short ratio can be a sign of an impending ""long squeeze,"" or rapid covering of long positions which increases the rate at which price declines. However, the current ratio of 1.42 is lower than both the ratio of 1.8 to 1 set in August and the all-time high ratio of 3.74 to 1 set in February of 2018.

42430215,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCRh,1550598324,Judge Appoints Law Firms to Represent QuadrigaCX Customers,"Canadian law firms Miller Thomson and Cox & Palmer will represent as many as 115,000 customers of Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX in the coming weeks.  Nova Scotia Supreme Court Judge Michael Wood ruled Tuesday that the firms would get the nod after nearly a week's worth of deliberations.  The firms vied for the position against fellow Canadian law firms Bennett Jones/McInnes Cooper and Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt/Patterson Law during a hearing last week in Halifax.  In his ruling, Wood explained that both Miller Thomson and Cox & Palmer have ""extensive insolvency and [Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act] experience,"" while Miller Thomson also has experience with cryptocurrency-related proceedings.  He also noted that the firms' proposal was ""thought out carefully with a view to minimizing costs.""  Miller Thomson is now tasked with collecting information about each of the possible creditors, including contact information and claim amounts. While the firms will not be immediately filing a class-action lawsuit due to a stay of proceedings granted at the beginning of the month, they can lay the groundwork for any future lawsuit.  The stay of proceedings is currently set to expire on March 7, with a hearing planned for March 5 to update the court on what progress Quadriga and its court-appointed monitor, Ernst & Young (EY), have made in their attempts to recover or otherwise raise $196 million – the total amount the exchange owes its users, according to various court filings.  It is possible that Quadriga and EY will file for an extension to the stay, though it is unclear whether Judge Wood will approve it.  Background  QuadrigaCX first hinted at signs of trouble last month, when it announced its founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, died of complications from Crohn's disease in December 2018.  The exchange later explained that Cotten was the only individual to know the private keys to Quadriga's cold storage wallets, meaning no one could access $136 million in cryptocurrencies stored offline.  The exchange filed for creditor protection, giving it a brief reprieve to try to recover its missing cryptocurrencies, unlock a further $53 million in fiat held by payment processors and possibly even sell its trading platform.  So far, Quadriga has not had any success in recovering the frozen crypto, and even lost another 100 bitcoin earlier this month when it ""inadvertently"" sent them to cold wallets it cannot access. The exchange did not explain how this happened.  While blockchain analysis has hinted at some of the wallet addresses the exchange is using, neither Quadriga nor EY has confirmed which addresses actually belong to Quadriga.

42430207,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCHh,1550597425,Ethereum Mining Pool Receives Mysterious $300K Blockchain Payout,"Ethereum mining pool Sparkpool received a payout of over 2,000 ETH (worth $300,000) just for mining one block on the ethereum blockchain Tuesday – a figure that's about 600 times the network's standard block reward.  Miners who secure blocks are programmed to be awarded 3 ETH (about $500) for every new transaction block added to the ethereum blockchain. On top of this, there is also a small payout attached to transactions incentivizing miners to validate and include new transactions into a mined block.  Yet, with only 210 validated transactions, Sparkpool received 2,103.1485 ETH at block number 7,238,290, according to data from ethereum block explorer Blockscout.  As highlighted on Twitter by Jimmy Zhong – co-founder of decentralized application platform IOST – the strange activity could be seen as a random fluke, with one ethereum user (or perhaps multiple) accidentally attaching abnormally high transaction fees to their payments.  Alternatively, it could be seen as a sign of goodwill from an anonymous supporter of the ethereum mining community, which in recent days has been divided over a contentious proposal to change which type of mining chips can be employed by miners seeking to compete for rewards.  Others suggested it could be a less altruistic attempt to ""wash"" money through the ethereum blockchain, obfuscating that it might have been illegitimately acquired.  But if past crypto history is any indicator, the likelihood of an innocent human error is not as outlandish as one might assume. Back in July 2014, one bitcoin user attached 30 bitcoins worth of transaction fees to a 38 bitcoin transaction due to an accidental error in typing, an error that despite enhancements in UX, is not altogether uncommon in the industry at large.

42430204,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCBh,1550589931,BitGo Offering $100 Million in Crypto Insurance Through Lloyd's of London,"Crypto security company BitGo is making good on plans to facilitate insurance for digital assets by providing $100 million of cover against theft or the loss of cryptographic keys via the Lloyd’s of London insurance market.  The announcement comes in the wake of the QuadrigaCX debacle, where the exchange announced it could not access its cold storage wallets following the death of its founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, as he was the only company employee to know its private keys.  Custodial assets held in BitGo business wallets or in its qualified custodian arm, BitGo Trust Company, will be covered against third-party hacks or the theft of private keys; insider theft by employees of private keys; and physical loss or damage of private keys, the company said.  BitGo said last year that it was looking to secure insurance for its customers' assets.  In an unusual move, BitGo named one of the Lloyd’s underwriters involved - AmTrust. The cold storage of crypto assets is a natural fit for the so-called specie insurance market, which provides cover for things like vaulted bullion, art and other treasures.  BitGo’s Lost Key Cover is being offered by Digital Asset Services, an insurance provider overseen by U.K. regulator the Financial Conduct Authority.  Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, said in a statement that ""this is the most complete insurance offering in the industry,"" adding:  ""It is not always easy for some clients to understand under what circumstances their investments are insured and to what extent their loss would be covered. We are changing that by being more transparent than any other company about the terms of our coverage. Transparency and accuracy is essential for building trust in the market.""

42430206,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCDh,1550588438,2 Crypto Startups Unveil Security Token Issuance and Trading Service,"Two crypto startups want to streamline the process of issuing and trading security tokens by providing an all-in-one solution.  Securitize, a Coinbase-backed security token startup, is partnering with OTCXN, a blockchain infrastructure company to develop and offer a digital security offering service. Under the arrangement announced Tuesday, the two companies will help other firms tokenize and sell securities by combining Securitize's securities compliance platform with OTCXN's custodial ledger system.  Carlos Domingo, CEO and co-founder of Securitize, told CoinDesk that his firm would create and facilitate the sale the tokens in compliance with the relevant security laws in each client's jurisdiction.  OTCXN founder and CEO Rosario Ingargiola added that Securitize would create the security tokens on the ethereum blockchain using the ERC-20 standard and handle the initial issuance. A smart contract would be used to enforce investor compliance procedures.  Ingargiola's company would then provide infrastructure to support secondary market trading of the token, he told CoinDesk.  However, the security tokens themselves would not be traded. Instead, another token representing the securities would be transacted.  Trading without custody  Custodians, such as Kingdom Trust or Prime Trust, would store the security tokens using their specific systems, which may include cold wallets. A digital representation would be the actual object traded on OTCXN's system, he explained.  ""Under the OTCXN model, issuers and investors are able to trade these assets with anyone on the network, no matter what blockchain they are natively issued on, what custodian they use or what exchange client orders are sitting on,"" Ingargiola said, adding:  ""The blockchain ledgers that are part of the solution we provide to custodians are really just another kind of ledger system which becomes, for assets digitized and being transacted on our network, the real-time golden source of truth. Transactions settle atomically in real-time, on-chain, with finality and cryptographic provability.""  While these digital representations may be what is traded on OTCXN's system, Domingo added that ""you [still] own the security.""  Echoing that point, Ingargiola said: ""You don’t have to trust us since we are not the custodian of any assets, nor the counterparty to any trades.""  That being said, the companies are not quite ready to issue security tokens just yet. While OTCXN has its infrastructure solutions up and running, it has not issued any security tokens with Securitize, as the firms are still waiting on regulatory approvals in a number of jurisdictions. There was no immediate timeline on when the companies might receive these approvals.  OTCXN is simultaneously looking to partner with specific broker-dealers or companies with alternative trading system licenses, he said.

42430211,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCLh,1550586638,Crypto Trader Cumberland Upgrades from Skype to Wall Street Interface,"Cryptocurrency market maker Cumberland is modernizing the way it handles over-the-counter (OTC) trades with counterparties.  Announced Tuesday, the unit of financial trading giant DRW has unveiled a so-called single-dealer platform called Marea, allowing institutional investors to interact with Cumberland through a screen-based interface, rather than negotiating trades by phone or Skype.  As such, the new portal brings Cumberland in line with the way OTC trading has been conducted on Wall Street for more than a decade in traditional asset classes like stocks.  “This is a single-dealer platform and a way for our counterparties to interact with our markets, execute, trade and also view their trading history via a platform,"" Bobby Cho, Cumberland's global head of trading, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We looked at what other asset classes have done in the past, and that was an evolution from voice to chat to kind of on screens.”  To start, the new OTC platform will handle trading of 10 popular cryptocurrencies and also interacts with back-office reporting, ably handled via a tie-up with trade reporting specialists MG Stover.  The initial 10 market pairs include zcash, stellar lumens and the U.S. dollar-linked stablecoin TrueUSD, and then the plan is to offer the other coins Cumberland trades, said Cho.  “We are hoping to expand that into all the coins that we trade here, so upwards of about 40 coins, and then expand across the different settlement fiat currencies we also settle in – dollars, Swiss francs, euros, GBP and other currencies like that,” he said.  ""So it's a little bit different from exchanges where you are set to what the exchange offers you from just an order book perspective. In the future, we hope this opens up our counterparties to trade any asset that we allow against either any fiat currency or any other crypto that we offer.""  Research and back office  Also to be added to the portal is the research Cumberland began producing in-house last year, Cho said.  Meanwhile, Marea integrates with back-office trade reporting and reconciliation of positions at the end of the day, said Cho, “whether that’s through a spreadsheet that’s downloadable or through the user interface.”  His team wasn’t going to attempt to build a “full-stack solution for front and back office in a silo,"" noted Cho.  To help with the process, third party fund administrators were brought on board, such as MG Stover, which currently services over 80 crypto-dedicated hedge funds.  Matt Stover, CEO of MG Stover, said this involves simple concepts like getting a trade confirmation that is time-stamped with the right quantity and making sure funds have proper books and record.  “We take best practices from the private fund administration space and apply these to digital assets,"" he said.

New York's trueDigital, which was founded last March, has hired Thomas Kim away from Bridgewater Associates to be its chief executive. Notably, trueDigital is the firm that built a blockchain payments system for Signature Bank. While JPMorgan stole headlines last week for its ""JPM Coin,"" Signature said its similar Signet system is already processing millions of dollars a day.  Kim told CoinDesk his focus will be on expanding the work done for Signature Bank to other clients.  ""I personally believe the market is signaling tremendous opportunities to bring traditional and digital markets together, and trueDigital is on the forefront of this trend with its payment platform and crypto derivatives,"" Kim said. ""A lot of the bigger organizations are getting realistic about their capabilities, but the need for these solutions is not going down.""  Sunil Hirani, trueDigital's founder and now-former CEO, told CoinDesk that the partnership with Signature Bank has been going well. ""We needed to bring in someone like Thomas, with his experience and leadership, so we can take it to the next level,"" Hirani said.  Kim worked for the Connecticut-based Bridgewater, known for its unique and at-times-troubled company culture, as a manager within the firm's investment engine department for the past seven years. Prior to that he was the CEO of fintech company UNX LLC, which was acquired in 2012, and as a managing director at Lehman Brothers until it collapsed in late 2008.  The trueDigital-built Signet system was launched by Signature Bank last December. It's said to be based on a fork of ethereum and allows clients to send funds, or “Signets,” directly to each other. Notably, the solution was approvedhttps://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1812041.htm by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and secured coverage from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Bitcoin derivative exchange  Kim will also supervise the upcoming launch of trueDigital's exchange for bitcoin swaps, which is expected later this year. The company is waiting for approvals from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Hirani said. Derivatives based on other cryptocurrencies will be added later on, Kim said.  The company also offers over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin and ether pricing indices.  Despite the prolonged bear market, Kim said he is optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency:  ""I see many market movements by the institutions trying to figure out how they can include crypto derivatives in their portfolios.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced the news Monday, stating that via the Seoul Innovation Growth Fund, which launched last year, it will invest across various sectors in order to help startups that currently struggle to gain Series A or seed funding, CoinDesk Korea reports.  For 2019, it plans to invest 13.25 billion won ($11.75 million) in the first half and 8.4 billion won ($7.45 million) in the second half.  The investment in the first half will be divided across five segments: 2 billion won ($1.77 million) each will go to Fourth Industrial Revolution, Smart City and cultural content projects, 2.25 billion won ($2 million) into startup support and 3 billion won ($2.66 million) into rehabilitation support.  Blockchain projects are likely to be supported as one of the ""23 revolutionary technologies"" through the Fourth Industrial Revolution or Smart City allocations of the fund, the report indicates.  The city government also said that the average initial investment of South Korean startups needs to be increased from about $1.1 million currently, as compared to $7 million in London and $6.5 million in Silicon Valley.  ""Innovative start-up investment will be the cornerstone of corporate growth ... in our society,” Jo In-dong, head of the economic policy department within the Seoul Metropolitan Government, was quoted as saying.

42430209,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCJh,1550574003,Coinbase Acquires Blockchain-Tracking Startup Neutrino for Undisclosed Price,"Coinbase has acquired blockchain analytics startup Neutrino as part of a wider push to offer more diverse crypto assets across borders.  “This is particularly important as we work with regulators and agencies in different countries to bring new assets there,” Coinbase’s director of engineering and product, Varun Srinivasan, told CoinDesk. He added that Neutrino would help Coinbase identify “which new tokens are gaining value and gaining traction in the space.”  Neutrino’s eight employees will move into Coinbase’s London office this week, retaining their distinction as a separate entity in order to continue serving external clients. Srinivasan said this acquisition will help Coinbase research new assets while simultaneously ensuring the cryptocurrency exchange can identify undesirable activity, like theft, without handing over internal information to external companies. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.  The move comes just a few weeks after Israeli blockchain analytics firm Whitestream identified a Coinbase account that was funneling bitcoin donations to the Palestinian military-political group Hamas, which the U.S. government deems a terrorist organization. Coinbase declined to comment on this incident and Srinivasan said the Neutrino acquisition was already in the works for some time.  Broadly speaking about the benefits of owning an in-house analytics platform, Srinivasan said: “We are beefing up our abilities to do compliance and to work with regulators on issues across the space.”  Neutrino CEO Giancarlo Russo said in a statement that the acquisition was an “important milestone"" for innovation in Italy, where it is based, adding:  “We decided to join Coinbase because we’re totally aligned with the company’s mission of building an open financial system and we share the same commitment to regulation, compliance and security in the cryptocurrency space.""  Compared to its competitors, such as Whitestream and Chainalysis, Srinivasan said the Neutrino team was working much faster to include features for cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin. Plus, Neutrino’s European connections could help Coinbase gain a foothold in that region.  “They’ve done a really good job of building up in the European market,” Srinivasan said. “But we want to bring them to the American market and the international market and introduce them to companies that are doing all kinds of things with crypto that need blockchain intelligence.”  Srinivasan prefers the term “blockchain intelligence,” rather than analytics because it includes the aim to predict trends based on data insights, among other applications.  Rising sector  Blockchain analytics is becoming an increasingly important part of the broader cryptocurrency landscape.  Jonathan Levin, co-founder of the rival blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, told CoinDesk his company is now working with 100 clients across the industry, including exchanges.  While Coinbase was busy acquiring Neutrino, Chainalysis raised a $30 million Series B and opened a new office in London, preparing to expand even further into the European market now that the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive is expected to inspire new compliance requirements in several countries.  “Our revenue in 2018 quadrupled,” Levin told CoinDesk, declining to specify how much Chainalysis earned. “We’ve definitely seen an increase in demand across the board. And that’s because we’ve seen greater clarity in regulation, in APAC [the Asia-Pacific region] and in Europe.”  Coinbase has a significant amount of historical data that could help differentiate Neutrino from younger analytics startups. Overall, Srinivasan said Coinbase is looking to become the “Google of crypto” with “many different products” across the sector.  Srinivasan also added that several other acquisitions are still in the works related to smart contracts and diversifying crypto-asset offerings.  “If we see a really great team that’s built a really great product, like Neutrino, for example, you’ll see us go out and talk to them and try to bring them into the Coinbase family to extend the suite of products that we have,” Srinivasan said.

42381583,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLef,1550570458,Bitcoin Price Crosses Key Long-Term Hurdle For First Time in 4 Months,"Correction (14:45 UTC, Feb. 19, 2019): This article previously incorrectly stated that the 100-day MA was last crossed last May. The article has been correct with the correct date, Oct. 15.  View:  Bitcoin has passed through the 100-day moving average for the first time in 127 days.  The primary lower-high trend is yet to be challenged, but the move indicates a willingness by the bulls to test the upper range of the ascending triangle.  Total growing (bullish) volume on the 4-hour chart is at its highest point in over 10 days.  However, price action has stalled Tuesday, as indecision brings the possibility of a pullback.  Bitcoin (BTC) has shot through established resistances for a second time this month, passing a key long-term moving average before finally hitting a point of exhaustion on the new daily open.  Price action crossed over the 100-day moving average (MA) at around $3,850 late Monday night (UTC), backed by a larger-than-average increase in total growing volume, a welcome sign for the bulls. The night's action also saw the cryptocurrency pass $3,950 briefly before pulling back slightly.  The last time bitcoin was above the 100-day MA was back on Oct. 15, 2018, around four months ago.  Still, there is a long way to go before converting the trend from bearish to bullish, as can be seen by the lower-high structure on the daily chart.  At press time, BTC is trading at $3,860, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. That's up 4.36 percent on the day.  Daily chart  However, bullish momentum has wavered since crossing the 100-day MA and price action has all but stalled as indecision took over post breakout.  Yet the move also represents greater conviction on the bullish front to test the upper trendline of the ascending triangle where the $4,075 resistance level has presented an issue since Dec. 20, according to Coinbase data.  Interestingly, the volume bars and their respective peaks are beginning to even up, creating a parabolic curve that could provide the bulls with encouragement to push to greater heights, as per volume analysis theory.  4-hour chart  However, as can be seen on BTC's previous topside wick, there is significant drawdown potential, as exhaustion marks an opportunity for the bears to regain control and trigger a sell-off similar to what happened back in November 2018.

A Reuters report on Monday, citing anonymous government sources, said that companies and industry groups “that could become stakeholders in a blockchain deployment process” have been invited to provide recommendations on the strategy.  Whether proposed recommendations would result in any new legislation is unclear at the moment.  Germany’s capital and largest city, Berlin, hosts around 170 blockchain startups, and the country is seeing “great interest” in exploring blockchain technology across various sectors, including automobile, pharma, energy and public sector administration, the report adds.  Europe’s strongest economy, Germany has issued positive statements on blockchain tech previously. Back in June, president of the German Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), Felix Hufeld, said that blockchain technology is “revolutionary” and its applications could turn the entire financial sector “upside down.”  In fact, interest in the tech has been growing across the EU. Just last week, Luxembourg passed a bill providing a legal framework for securities issued over blockchains. And last December, the Italian government published a list of 30 experts brought together to develop its blockchain strategy.  On a regional level, the European Parliament recently called for measures to boost blockchain adoption in trade and business. Moreover, seven EU member nations – France, Italy, Spain, Malta, Cyprus, Portugal and Spain – came together in December, to promote the use of blockchain tech to boost government services and economic well-being.

42381578,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nLZd,1550549448,Mining Giant Bitmain Posts $500 Million Loss in IPO Financial Filing,"Mining hardware giant Bitmain lost about $500 million in the third quarter of 2018 amid an overall bearish market for cryptocurrency, CoinDesk has learned.  The Beijing-based company recently provided an update on its financial results to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx), which is reviewing Bitmain's application for an initial public offering (IPO) first filed in September.  The update showed Bitmain earned around $500 million in the first nine months of last year, on slightly over $3 billion of revenues, according to a source familiar with the situation. The filing, which is not public, does not break down the results by quarter.  However, Bitmain previously disclosed it had grossed profits of $1 billion in the first half of 2018. Subtracting that from a $500 million profit for the first nine months leaves it with a net loss of roughly $500 million for the third quarter.  The company had also previously reported $2.8 billion of revenues for the first half, so the $3 billion figure for the first nine months works out to third-quarter revenues of just about $200 million.  (Bitmain only needs to provide the nine-month figures at this stage under HKEx rules, which say that listing applicants can be no more than six months behind on reporting.)  These are the first precise figures to show the company's reversal of fortune following the significant growth in revenues and profits over the past several years documented in the IPO application filed in late September.  When contacted by CoinDesk, Bitmain declined to comment for this article, citing its pending IPO application. After publication, the Chinese media outlet Caijing quoted an unnamed representative for Bitmain denying the report. “The rumors are not true, and we will make announcements in due course in accordance with the requirements of relevant laws and regulations,” the spokesperson said, according to a translated version of the Caijing article.  However, Bitmain had already signaled it had fallen on harder times with layoffs and office closures around the world beginning at the end of the last year that affected almost every unit of the company. Its main businesses are manufacturing mining equipment and operating mining farms and pools – activities that have broadly suffered from the slump in crypto prices.  Hit to portfolio  Further, the update provided to HKEx showed Bitmain's crypto holdings dropped in value from more than $800 million as of June 30 to less than $700 million at the end of the third quarter, the source said. This decline of more than $100 million over three months reflected the overall drop in market prices over that period.  The company's IPO application, filed in late September, indicated that Bitmain mainly held bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, litecoin and dash, although it did not provide a breakdown of how much it held of each asset.  Since Sept. 30, all of the cryptos mentioned in that filing declined by more than 50 percent, according to CoinMarketCap.  In particular, the price of bitcoin cash, which forked off the original bitcoin network in 2017 with Bitmain's support, declined by over 70 percent.  The nine-month financial update will not be revealed to the public unless Bitmain can proceed to a listing hearing with approvals from the HKEx before the six-month window closes on Mar. 26, the source said.  And it remains an open question whether that will happen, since, as previously reported, the HKEx is hesitant to approve applications from cryptocurrency mining equipment makers due to uncertainties about the sustainability of their profits.  UPDATE (19, February 16:10 UTC): This article has been updated to include a subsequent statement from Bitmain in Chinese media.
