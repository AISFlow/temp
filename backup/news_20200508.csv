42383636,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqbN,1588969136,"Market Wrap: Interest in Bitcoin Rises as Prices Near $10K, but Can It Continue?","The clock is ticking down to the expected halving event on Monday and bitcoin is capturing the interest of investors who may not normally follow the cryptocurrency markets.      At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was trading up less than 1 percent over 24 hours at $9,966 and above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, bullish technical indicators. The cryptocurrency has spent much of its U.S. trading hours with a $9,900 handle on spot exchanges like Coinbase, a small retreat after briefly breaking above the $10,000 barrier Thursday.      “Most of the people I know are buying bitcoin and gold as a hedge against global recession. Most likely this trend will continue to grow strong,” said Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital.      A boost above the $10,000 price level is certainly a big draw if you are interested in bitcoin. What’s more, conversations about the bitcoin reward halving, expected Monday, May 11, have increased in the past week. Kogan believes bitcoin prices can push up to as much as $12,000 before the halving, an every-four-years event that this time will lower bitcoin’s generation of new cryptocurrency from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC.      Read More: Bitcoin Halving 2020 Explained      Additionally, investor Paul Tudor Jones II, who manages $38 billion in assets, published an outlook and change to one of his fund’s strategies to reflect trading in bitcoin futures on Thursday.      “Paul Tudor Jones has written quite a knowledgeable piece on bitcoin. Adoption on Wall Street-fueled halving-FOMO is my bet,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter crypto trader.      “It’s clearly lots of casual investors coming in and picking it up. I’m even getting friends and contacts asking me again,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.      However, in his note, Jones revealed his fund’s strategy is around bitcoin derivatives, likely on advanced futures platforms like CME, not purchasing spot bitcoin on exchanges like Coinbase. “We have set the initial maximum exposure guideline for purchasing bitcoin futures to a low single digit exposure percentage,” Jones wrote in his outlook titled “The Great Monetary Inflation.”      Indeed, derivatives such as futures are seeing an uptick, and Swissquote’s Thomas expects an interesting dynamic in the coming weeks. As more investors have conversations on bitcoin’s place in an uncertain global economy, professional traders active in the crypto derivatives market are hedging their bets with both futures and options.      Read More: The Men Who Stare at Charts      The crypto options market is experiencing record highs – over $1 billion – but there are more bearish bets in the form of put options than bullish calls. “Looking at bitcoin options we can see that puts are more expensive than calls,” said Thomas. “This implies that more people are picking up downside protection.”      “New money is driving us higher ahead of the halving and professionals will push us lower afterwards,” he added. “Medium term, still very much bullish, just short term we’re in for a rough ride.”    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mostly in the green on Friday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, less than a percent in 24 hours, trading at $213 as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).

42383634,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqV5,1588967480,3 Straight Record Days Drive CME Bitcoin Futures Open Interest to All-Time High,"Open interest for CME bitcoin futures made a new all-time high of just under $500 million on Friday, the third consecutive day of open interest records this week. Significant growth in CME futures demonstrates the intensifying contest between the stalwart institutional trading platform and crypto-native derivatives exchanges like BitMEX.      Over the past month, CME’s bitcoin futures market has grown faster than nearly every other bitcoin futures market on a percentage and real growth basis.      Soaring CME open interest coincides with news that prominent American hedge funds are interested in investing in bitcoin futures. As of April, Renaissance Technology’s flagship Medallion fund is considering trading bitcoin futures on CME. On Thursday, Paul Tudor Jones II of the Tudor Investment Corp. also told investors he is keen to invest in bitcoin futures.      “The recent massive growth in regulated futures markets suggests growing institutional interest in bitcoin as an emerging macro hedge against money printing and geopolitical uncertainties,” said Qiao Wang, director of product at Messari and former quantitative trader at Tower Research.      See also: Most Bitcoin Buyers Are in the Money Ahead of the Halving, Data Suggests      CME competitors in the U.S. have had trouble keeping pace, however. CBOE, for example, finally discontinued its bitcoin futures product in June 2019 after suffering mediocre trading volume for over two years.      Bakkt, another competitor that launched physically settled bitcoin futures in late 2019 as an alternative to cash-settled CME contracts, claims less than 5% of the U.S. bitcoin futures market. The company has lost two CEOs within six months.      For all intents and purposes, the American bitcoin futures market is the CME, and it’s growing faster than almost every other market.      “The recent growth of open interest in our bitcoin futures contract demonstrates market participants are increasingly turning to CME Group to express views and manage their risk amid ongoing global uncertainty,"" said Tim McCourt, CME Group Global Head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Products. ""We are committed to continuing to provide our customers with the risk management tools and robust liquidity they need to navigate this challenging environment.""

New Zealand’s monetary authority is looking for a “Head of Money and Cash,” a new position that will, according to a May 5 job posting, be “focused on the future of money.” The new role will be a digital currency specialist who can speak to trends reshaping financial infrastructure – “online payments and digital currencies” – and provide “thought leadership around the future of cash and money.”      What the job entails is up for debate, but that seems to be the point. This “Cash Czar” will oversee an entire division of wonks pondering physical cash security, infrastructure and other monied areas “from a holistic and policy perspective.”      “This is a time of change for both the Reserve Bank and the global market transforming the demand and use of physical cash,” RBNZ wrote in the job description. “New and emerging forms of digital payments are here to stay and the method in which people pay for things is changing rapidly.”      That theme of change has only accelerated through COVID-19, with more businesses becoming weary of physical banknote exchange and digital payments, already on the rise in some countries, taking on even greater importance.

42383627,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqSZ,1588965133,"Most Bitcoin Buyers Are in the Money Ahead of the Halving, Data Suggests","With bitcoin more than doubling in price since “Black Thursday” nearly two months ago, nearly 85% — or 25.79 million — of addresses holding the cryptocurrency are now “in the money,” according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock. However, the current state of the bitcoin market is warning of a post-halving price pullback.      The number one cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $10,000 at press time - up nearly 160% from the low of $3,867 registered on March 12, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price.      An address is said to be in the money if the current price of bitcoin is higher than the price at which the coin was purchased or sent to the address.      While 85% of the addresses are in the money, 10.8%, or 3.28 million addresses are out of the money or have acquired coins at an average price higher than the current market price. The remaining 4.1% (1.24 million) are at the money, meaning the average price they acquired their bitcoin is around current market levels.      Such a structure may not bode well for the cryptocurrency in the near term. With the majority of addresses already in a state of profit, some observers expect selling pressure to emerge over the weekend or following the mining reward halving expected on May 11.      “We anticipate a number of investors will take advantage of rising prices ahead and into the halving to realize gains in the short term,"" said Ed Hindi, CIO of Tyr Capital Arbitrage SP, which focuses on liquidity provision and arbitrage within the cryptocurrency markets.      See also: Money Reimagined: Picasso Up, Main Street Down      Meanwhile, market intelligence firm Glassnode tweeted on Thursday that more than 80% of the current bitcoin supply is profitable and significant increases to BTC's price in anticipation of the halving could trigger some to realize gains in the short term.    Increased retail participation    A post-halving drop looks quite possible because the retail participation has gone up over the past few months. The number of addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC began increasing exponentially from February and recently rose to a record high of 3,014,888, according to Glassnode data.      The address growth continued even while bitcoin’s prices slid from $10,000 to the $3,867 seen in the first half of March. Put simply, some investors look to have acquired coins at below $5,000 are now sitting on more than 100% returns.      Gains of that magnitude may lead more than a few small traders to lock in profits at current prices.    Halving priced in by large traders    The potential bullish impact of the reward halving on bitcoin’s price has been extensively discussed over the past few months. At the same time, the participation from large traders, popularly known as whales, and macro traders and institutions has gone up.      The number of addresses holding at least 10,000 bitcoin recently rose to the highest since August. The metric has increased by over 10% since early March.      Open interest, or open positions, in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange jumped to a record high of $489 million on Thursday. The CME open interest is widely considered as a proxy for macro traders or institutions.      See also: Open Positions on Bitcoin Options Pass $1B for First Time      Thus it appears large traders have priced in halving at least to some extent and may book profits following the halving, pushing prices lower.      “As institutional investors have got involved, we believe the longstanding and well documented buy the rumor and sell the fact trading strategy will be a key driver of short-term price action,” said Hindi.    Pullback would be temporary    While the cryptocurrency could come under pressure after halving, analysts are confident the dip would be short-lived.      This is because the current macro environment may likely bolster bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against inflation. Not only is bitcoin’s pace of supply expansion scheduled to drop by 50% next week, the supply cut is happening at a time when the major central banks are pumping unprecedented amounts of liquidity into the system to counter the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy.      “If inflation reigns going forward, bitcoin will go off the dial. I am currently amassing BTC,” said Clem Chambers, founder and CEO of financial markets website ADVFN.com.      Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto trading firm GSR, said the general retail and traditional financial communities are severely under-allocated versus traditional asset classes.      As of now, Renaissance Technology and legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones II are the only known traditional market bigwigs to have forayed into cryptocurrencies.      See also: Bitcoin Breaches $10K for First Time Since February      Thus, there are plenty of interested investors still waiting on the sidelines who could enter the market on price dips.      Historical data also support the argument that post-halving dip would be short-lived. Bitcoin fell by nearly 30% in the four weeks following its second halving, which took place on July 9, 2016.

Standardization of money came relatively late to the world. One of the lessons of history is that with globalization comes a tendency for a particular currency to become the number one dominant currency for transactions, for trade, for international reserves. A great question to ask is: globalization enters this phase of crisis: will there be some other transition from the dollar to another currency? Or could we see a reversion to a multipolar, multi currency world?” Niall Ferguson    On the first episode of Money Reimagined, we looked at the strange paradox of the U.S. dollar. On the one hand, massive stimulus fueled by ""money printer go brrr"" should suggest for inflation. At the same time, however, there is no denying the dollar is stronger than ever, rising in value compared to other currencies in spite of that inflation potential.      There is a sense among many, however, that this strength is relative, temporary and, above all, unsustainable. In a world where a global dollar-based monetary system does not serve the interest of the world, what replaces it?      This episode is about the sovereign contenders - in other words, the currencies that would work through existing power structures and paradigms but replace the dollar with something else.      We look first at the euro. Created in the wake of the Cold War to bind a newly reborn Europe in shared identity and economic destiny, it entered the COVID-19 crisis in a beleaguered state. Brexit had taken the most valuable economy out of the union and flagging economies within it created significant fragility. What’s more, Europe simply doesn’t have the monetary tools available to a country like the United States. Peter Zeihan, the geopolitical strategist and author of ""Disunited Nations,"" explained it like this:      “There’s nothing that the Europeans can do in terms of stimulus spending without raising debt. Even if they decided to do something like QE - which last time took years - they would now have to have the debate over who gets how much. The Europeans are having a hard time raising the capital necessary for dealing with this crisis, whereas the US can just flip a switch.”      CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey pointed out the European Union is also dealing with questions of political validity, with COVID-19 exacerbating a fundamental issue.      “The capacity of the EU to act in unison and the common interest the EU is supposed to represent kind of fell apart. All of a sudden, borders got shutdown and it was each nation to him or herself. So the EU’s validity to manage this has been challenged. COVID is a force for decentralizing power. From a currency perspective, the value of these currencies are political questions. Therefore the EU’s political validity is being questions right now. I’m not sure that’s going to be a very positive environment for the euro.”      The next contender profiled is the Libra project. While much of the initial conversation about the libra currency focused on the past transgressions and potential political illegitimacy of its founding organization of Facebook, for economists and system thinkers, the most powerful idea contained in the project was the idea of a global currency standard backed by a basket of the world’s fiat rather than pegged to any single currency. In many ways, this harkened back to John Maynard Keynes’ Bretton Woods proposal for a bancor - separate from the individual currencies of nations around the world. Indeed, in many ways, the most interesting impact of Libra initially was getting global central bankers like Mark Carney to propose their own ""synthetic hegemonic currencies.""      Finally, we look at China’s digital currency or DCEP. Is it an unbelievable surveillance honeypot? An attempt to front run the West on a key technological innovation? A method of extending economic spheres of influence? Or is it all of the above?      Listen to Money Reimagined - Episode 2 to find out.

Transcript      Announcer:      Welcome back to The Breakdown: Money Re-Imagined, a special podcast micro series in the run up to Consensus:Distributed, a free to attend virtual event from May 11th through the 15th hosted by CoinDesk. Money Re-Imagined is about the battle for the future of money and the post COVID-19 world and it's a hell of a story. This episode is sponsored by ErisX, the Stellar Development Foundation and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. Here's your host NLW.      NLW:      Welcome back to the breakdown. So on the first episode of this special money reimagined series, we looked at this strange, almost schizophrenia narratives around the U S dollar. On the one hand: money printer go BRRRRRRRR massive stimulus and increasingly exotic forms of QE would suggest for future inflation right? On the other however, in practice the dollar has gotten nothing but stronger and become even more in demand during the crisis.The goal of that episode was to maybe piece through and figure out how these two things, how these two narratives might not be mutually exclusive.      NLW:      On this episode, however, we are turning our attention and instead we'll be looking at the contenders in this battle for the future of money. These are the insurgents that would replace the dollar in the global order and in particular in this episode, the insurgents who would replace it in an inside the system formal way. So before we fully dive in, let's get some historical context from Niall Ferguson. He's a historian and senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution and the author of works like The Ascent of Money. It wasn't always a foregone conclusion that the world would be organized around a single dominant standard like the U S dollar. In fact, as Ferguson argues here, this was a byproduct of globalization.      Niall Ferguson:      Some of the greatest theorists about money... Hayek, for example, Friedman, thought it better for the to be multiple competing currencies rather than a single global standard. And there were plenty of periods in history when that was the case. There were multiple currencies in, for example, 17th century Europe, and there were in fact many different forms of payment across the United States in the 19th century. Standardization of money came relatively late to the world. It began with the British gold standard, which by around 1900 was a global standard pegging currencies to a specific quantity of gold. I think one of the lessons of history is that with globalization comes a tendency for a particular currency to become the number one dominant currency for transactions, for trade, for international reserves. In the 19th century, it was the British pound. In the 20th century, it became the U S dollar.      Niall Ferguson:      And a great question to ask is globalization enters phase of crisis. Will there be some other transition from the dollar to another currency or could we see a reversion to a multipolar, multicurrency world of the salt that we've seen in previous eras.      NLW:      ""A unipolar monetary order"" was a byproduct of globalization. Globalization is being unwound right now and unwound in an accelerated fashion, thanks to COVID-19 so when it comes to the U S dollar system, does this mean an unraveling too, and if so, who might be stepping up? That's really the whole point of today's episode. Let's look first to the Euro. If the Genesis of the global dollar standard that we're on now was the end of world war two and the Bretton Woods conference, the Euro came about as Europe tried to Reforge both a shared identity and a shared economic destiny after the fall of the Soviet union. Agreed upon in principle in the Maastrichtt treaty in 1992, the Euro would come into being real form.      NLW:      About a decade later. It quickly became the second most widely used reserve currency after the U S dollar, but as Europe and the Euro came into the COVID-19 crisis, both were on kind of shaky ground. Brexit had taken the most valuable economy out of the European union and flagging economies within the union created pretty significant fragility. In this clip, we revisit comments from the geopolitical strategist and author of Disunited nations, Peter Zeihan.      Peter Zeihan:      The degree to which the United States is the sole... Sole store of value in the global system was already pretty extreme in the last few years, and it's only gone up during the crisis because there's nothing that the Europeans can do in terms of stimulus spending without actually raising debt. Even if they decide to do something like QE like the United States has done, they don't have to have to have the debate, which last time took years over who gets how much of whatever the stimulus spending happens to be and no one wants to throw money... Any more money than they have to in the black hole that has become Greece, Italy, despite the death rate and how tragic that is has had 30 years to clean up their banking sector, they've actually gone the wrong direction and no one in Europe wants to be responsible for paying for that.      Peter Zeihan:      So aside from some German debt, because there's actually a shortage of high quality debt in Europe, the Europeans are having a hard time raising the capital that is necessary to deal with this crisis, whereas the U S can just flip a switch and that's what we've done. If the Euro continues to exist, it will exist over a shriveled demographically spent economy that is no longer capable of exports. That's not a functional bloc and that's their best case scenario. More likely, this whole thing just breaks up. And the United States basically absorbs a huge amount of capital from Europe.      NLW:      CoinDesk chief content officer, Michael Casey takes this argument around the Euro farther saying in some ways it's inherently a question of political validity.      Michael Casey:      So the, the Euro is actually a really interesting way to think about some of the other questions. Those of us who are interested in cryptocurrencies and new currency designs go about perceiving things because in of itself, right. It was a really interesting experiment. It's an entirely different way of thinking about issuance of a sovereign currency because it's a Federation of otherwise sovereign Nation States who are yes, are bound with some level of political unity but within the EU, but are otherwise independent but have this one common currency. And that disconnect between sort of the local political power and the reduced political power at the EU level... And the common currency is actually at the heart of the Euro crisis that we saw maybe 10 years ago. The capacity of the EU to act in unison and the common interest that the EU was supposed to represent kind of fell apart, right?      Michael Casey:      Everybody was each to their own, Italy was unto its own Spain with central. All of a sudden borders got shut down. It was all each nation to him or herself as the pandemic took hold. So that is kind of validity as an entity to manage this I think has been challenged somewhat. COVID-19 is a force for decentralizing power. It's pushing interest down to the local level. And so I think from a currency perspective, the value of these currencies are political questions. Therefore the EU's own sort of political validity is being challenged right now. I'm not sure that's going to be a very positive environment for the Euro.      NLW:      Of course, the contenders in the battle for the future of money aren't just other sovereign currencies that exist today, like the beleaguered Euro. Coming up after the break, we turn our attention to something more digital and potentially even more disruptive.

Libra Announcement Video:      So why is it simple to send one of these in an instant but not money? What if we made money truly global, stable and secure? What if everyone was invited to the global economy with access to the same financial opportunities? Introducing Libra, a new global payment system designed for the digital world, backed by the belief that money should be fast for Opai and Lagos. Simple for Saul's family business in Manila. And secure for Betsabe when sending money home to Mexico City. It's powered by blockchain, making it safe and accessible no matter who you are or where you're from....      NLW:      In July of 2019 Facebook stunned the financial world with the announcement of Libra. Libra was a new global money to be governed by an association of corporations and nonprofits. Importantly, and disruptively Libra wouldn't get it stability from a peg to a single fiat currency, but instead would be backed by a basket of fiat currencies. Now, much of the ensuing attention focused on questions of Facebook's legitimacy in leading the project. They had outstanding and unresolved criticism around data practices and in the U S in particular, there were huge issues with the government vis-a-vis the 2016 elections. For economists and systems thinkers however, it was this basket of currencies idea that was the most interesting thing. For some, it looked like a modern day version of the Bancor, a global pan-national currency, first proposed by John Maynard Keynes at Bretton Woods. Macro researcher. Luke Grommen provides a quick synopsis of that proposal      Luke Grommen:      At the end of world war II at Bretton Woods, there were two options. John Maynard Keynes proposed something called the Bancor, which was a neutral settlement asset that floated in all currencies and would have basically prevented systemic deficits and surpluses from building up over time that we have since seen. Because we didn't go with the Bancor. We went with a proposal from the United States as voiced by Harry Dexter White, which was the dollar is the center of the system. The dollar's pegged to gold at $35 an ounce and everything else is then tied to the dollar and it provided the U S what De Gaulle called ""exorbitant privilege"".      NLW:      When Facebook proposed the structure for its Libra, it sparked conversations at the highest level of global central bankers about whether the dollar system was to the continued benefit of the world. In this clip, Ferguson again discusses a similar sounding proposal from the then bank of England governor Mark Carney for what he called a quote, synthetic hegemonic currency.      Niall Ferguson:      Mark Carney gave a brilliant paper at the Jackson Hole Federal Reserve conference last summer in 2019 in which he argued that it was inherently unstable for the United States dollar to be ""world money"" for a variety of reasons. One of which being that that puts the position of the Federal Reserve into being essentially the world's central bank when it's mandated just to be the U S national central bank. Carney argued that we should be looking at ways of creating some surrogate digital currency linked potentially to more than one of the existing currencies. This bore more than a passing resemblance to what Facebook was trying to do with Libra, which was going to be a digital currency linked to existing currencies that would be held in a Swiss based reserve. We are, I think in other words, in an era of experimentation,      NLW:      ""An era of experimentation"". As it turns out that experimentation would not be limited to the wide eye dreams of tech companies. If U S regulators reacted to Libra with scorn at their past transgressions and the established monetary order took it as a moment to discuss a highly theoretical new non sovereign currency system. There was one party that reacted to Libra as a direct competitive threat. Coming up after the break, why one of the most speedy and significant responses to Libra came from China      Announcer:      Support for this podcast and this message come from Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund.

For more information, visit grayscale.co/coindesk.      NLW:      Even before the discussion of Libra and central bank digital currencies, China had built up a comparatively advanced system of mobile money. Niall Ferguson puts it in the context of how robust the Chinese corporate mobile money system is as compared to the experiments we were just discussing.      Niall Ferguson:      In fact, the most advanced of these experiments since Carney's paper is just a sketch and Libra is still at the launchpad stages in China where the Chinese technology companies have created a new kind of payment system, payment platforms like Alipay and it's 10cent equivalent, which are no longer just confined to China but are being adopted in more and more emerging markets.      NLW:      The relationship between private companies and the Chinese state of course, something very different from that of governments and companies in the West, but still if the Chinese communist party enjoyed the ability to surveil transactions through relationships with Ali pay and WeChatPay a digital currency would be something completely different. And on a whole different level, castle Island ventures, Nick Carter puts the opportunity for them pretty bluntly.      Nic Carter:      You know, China has grasped that if you control someone's finances and more generally someone's credit relationships that you effectively control that individual and you have full transparency into what they're doing and what their life is like. And so you have granular discretion to modify their behavior in any way.      NLW:      China began researching a prospective digital currency between 2014 and 2015 in the aftermath of Libra. However, there was a new significance in communications from the People's Bank of China who were dead set on sending a clear signal to the world that they intended to be the first major nation to bring a digital currency to market. Matthew Graham is the CEO of Sino global capital and has been based in China for the better part of seven years. In this clip he discusses how the crypto tech and finance communities in China responded to the increased focus on a Chinese DCEP or digital currency and electronics payment system last year.      Matthew Graham:      You know, I think it's important to understand that there are many different ecosystems and many different constituencies that play into something like that. So I think for some of the crypto OGs in China, it's just a question of what even is this? Is this crypto? Is it not crypto? How do we interact with something like DCEP and people choose to do that in a number of ways. For some people, they saw it as an opportunity to introduce new people to crypto through kind of a halo effect. For other groups of people that I saw it as a business opportunity where they could service many of the companies such as Alibaba and Ping An, which is a huge insurance company that are trying to find ways to integrate blockchain into their business. For companies like 10cent and Alibaba that have huge existing digital payments businesses with Alipay and with Tenpay, which is WeChatPay. I think there's a little bit of an under-covered story, which is that the Chinese government with DCEP is potentially competing with their enormously lucrative digital payments businesses. So there are a lot of moving parts here. There are all kinds of interacting. But the one thing then in common is that there were more eyes on blockchain and on crypto, both in China and internationally as a result of DCEP. And of course, Libra as well.      NLW:      Going into 20, 20 many believe that China's DSF would be one of the most important stories, not only in crypto but in global financial markets as a whole venture capitalist. Catherine Wu put it like this in January of 2020,      Katherine Wu:      I think every major Chinese tech company will launch a blockchain solution and all of their payment platforms will incorporate the Chinese DCEP, which is their digital currency, electric payment system. You know, I've always long thought that the only state backed stable coin or digital currency or whatever you want to call it, that will gain adoption and wide usage would be a China state backed currency instead of something like Libra. And you know, we sort of saw the announcement of DCEP, like sort of, this fall, but I think this reality will gain fruition in 2020.      NLW:      Interestingly, some argued that if anything COVID-19 created even more of a motivation for China to push forward with their DCEP project.      Michael Casey:      China's economy went into a tailspin before everybody else's. It went down into lockdown earlier than others. And the Chinese government needs these rapid growth rates to basically stand-up the political bargain that they've maintained with their population for the, for the last, you know, 30 odd years. We control your lives. Um, you know, we, we have certain constraints on your ability to move capital and to do certain things, but in return we'll give you economic growth and wellbeing and it'll continue to improve your lives. So on that basis, the Chinese have from time to time, just put their foot on the accelerator and thrown massive amounts of stimulus money to build bridges to nowhere and all sorts of ghost cities and everything else and managed to keep the machine going, building up massive amounts of debt in the process. And now they have to come out of this.      Michael Casey:      And so say that that bargain is under threat because of the slow... The massive downturn we will have faced. How do we get out of it? There's two things I think that they do. You know, one is they entered into a currency war. It's just, it's what you do. They desperately need to boost it and the currency is one tool that they have, um, from that is in terms of the value of the Yuan. And the other is that they use all this technology to absolutely fast track, innovation and development both domestically and overseas with all of their various partners using the digital currency as the vehicle through which they integrate all of those relationships.      NLW:      That was CoinDesk's Chief Content Officer Michael Casey, again, on how COVID-19 has created a new context for China's DCEP currency. All right, let's take a moment to gut check on the actors in this battle for the future of money. The Euro is in its own crises as it tries to figure out the politics of individual national healthcare response in the context of a common economic response. This is especially tricky as the ability for the European central bank to engage in the sort of quantitative easing that has become de rigueur in the USA is being challenged in court. Add it up, and you certainly don't see or don't expect a big move into the Euro. What about China? As we've seen, there's no doubt that they're moving aggressively forward with their digital currency project. The problem is that the fancy new digital model is still resting on shaky foundations.      NLW:      First, the world's opinion of Chinese leadership is flagging. Reuters is reporting that an internal report presented to the leaders of the CCP concluded that anti-Chinese sentiment, was at the highest it's been since Tiananmen square. Second, the Yuan to date has been primarily an internal currency. Peter Zeihan explains:      Peter Zeihan:      China's a bit of a black box because they... What data they do share, they tend to lie about. But we know that 99% of the Yuan in circulation is all within the mainland. It's not an internationally traded currency at all.      NLW:      And what about Libra? Well, the basket of currencies approach may have intrigued economists and even a few global central bankers. It created an instant regulatory brick wall in the USA. Libra tried to argue that the US's position in the global order was being maintained by having the USD comprise the largest single stake in the basket.      NLW:      Something like 50% of the basket was intended to be U S dollars. What's more, as they saw their positive message of banking, the unbanked wasn't working. Libra switched pretty aggressively to an argument that if we don't do this, China will. US regulators simply weren't buying it and this is to say nothing of the European countries who immediately called Libra an afront to their monetary sovereignty. By April of 2020, project lead, David Marcus summoned all of his optimism to announce that they had decided to pursue the much less ambitious model of ""individual fiat pegged stable coins"". Instead of allowing anyone to build wallets and applications for the currency, it would be entirely permissioned and within the system instead of the disruptor that would usher in a new non-sovereign modern bancor, they were effectively setting themselves up to compete with tether and USDC and maybe to build the rails and be the consultants for central banks who wanted to make their own digital currencies.      NLW:      From this vantage point, the continued supremacy of the U S dollar in its current form seems assured, but we don't live in a world anymore where the only types of money are those that come from governments or even work through the official channels. The times, '03, January, 2009 ""chancellor on the brink of a second bailout for banks"". These are the words embedded in the Bitcoin Genesis block words that harkened back to the last financial crisis, even as Libra failed to impress. There were those in power who recognized a new force on the scene. Representative Patrick McHenry in his opening remarks at the first Libra hearing.      Representative Patrick McHenry :      Change is here. Digital currencies exist. Blockchain technology is real, and Facebook's entry in this new world is just confirmation, albeit at scale. The world that Satoshi Nakamoto, author of the Bitcoin white paper envisioned and others are building is an unstoppable force. We should not attempt to deter this innovation and governments cannot stop this innovation and those that have tried have already failed.      NLW:      In our next episode of money reimagined, we look more closely at that unstoppable force. Can Bitcoin or any permissionless decentralized cryptocurrency compete in this battle for the future of money?

42383635,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqa7,1588962988,"Blockchain Bites: Paul Tudor Jones, Open Options and Why Bitcoin Looks Strong Heading to the Halving","Yesterday, it came to light that Paul Tudor Jones II, a titan investor, is considering bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. While it's unknown where he intends to make his allocation or how much he'll invest over what period of time through his flagship fund, we do know why. Bitcoin is what gold was in the 1970s, he thinks.      ""I am not a millennial investing in cryptocurrency, which is very popular in that generation, but a baby boomer,"" he said in a letter to investors. ""In a world that craves new safe assets, there may be a growing role for bitcoin.""      Next week as Consensus: Distributed kicks off, Blockchain Bites will be your guide to the event. We'll publish twice daily, providing a detailed schedule of events as well as a daily recap.

In other news, Bixin is launching a $66 million fund of funds, Massive Adoption organizer Jacob Kostecki is getting sued and Filecoin is delivering physical hard drives. Here's the story:    Top Shelf    Industry Head Looking to Hedge Paul Tudor Jones II, a pioneer of the modern hedge fund industry, is ready to bet on bitcoin’s price as an inflation hedge. Jones’ flagship $22 billion Tudor BVI Global Fund has been authorized to hold as much as “a low single-digit percentage exposure percentage"" of its assets in bitcoin futures, according to a note sent to investors this month. It is not clear whether the fund has begun buying futures, what kind (physically delivered or cash-settled), on which exchange it would do so or whether it plans to also trade the underlying commodity.      Bitcoin Halving Interest Doubles (Five Times Over) With fewer than four days left till bitcoin's halving, popular interest in the once-every-four-years event is reaching a fever pitch. Google Trends, a barometer for gauging interest in trending search topics, shows searches for ""halving"" or ""bitcoin halving"" at five times the peak in 2016, when the blockchain underwent its previous halving event. CoinDesk’s First Mover team takes a deeper dive, you can sign up for the newsletter here.      Serious Tensions Micree Ketuan Zhan, the exiled co-founder of Bitmain, has moved to reinstate his position granted the right to recover his status as legal representative of Beijing Bitmain Technology by the Beijing Haidian District Justice Bureau. When Zhan went to the bureau to collect his new registration license, he was met by a cadre of Bitmain executives seeking to block his move. Tensions escalated into a physical brawl, as reported by Chinese daily Caixin and a video circulating on WeChat.      Filecoin Delivers... a Package Filecoin is mailing out hard drives of climate data, world literature or the human genome to kick-start its file-storage network. In a program called Filecoin Discover, the Filecoin Foundation will deliver these tomes to future miners physically, on eight-terabyte hard drives, with instructions on how to link the devices to the Filecoin system to go live this year.      Fund of Funds Bixin, one of the earliest bitcoin miner operators and wallet startups, is dedicating 6,600 bitcoin, worth $66 million, to a new fund of funds. The company will target global quantitative trading funds whose strategies are based on arbitrage, bitcoin futures contracts and trend analysis.      Domination Derivative A new derivative from Bitfinex allows investors to take a position on bitcoin's overall share of the cryptocurrency market. The BTCDOM contract would allow investors to place a perpetual swap (a future without expiry date) based on bitcoin’s dominant value versus the value of other cryptocurrencies.      Contours of Finance HDBank has tapped blockchain network Contour to digitize and streamline trade finance. Contour uses R3’s Corda blockchain tech for the issuance and settlement of trade contracts, a process still done with pen and paper by some firms.      Shifting Trade Finance? Tradeshift, the digital trade finance platform that uses blockchain to make payments instant and transparent, has proposed a scheme to the government of Denmark that may free billions of dollars from supply chains. The plan offers lines of credit – backed up by the Danish government – to big companies to pay their suppliers instantly, as supply chains around the world calcify during the COVID-19 crisis.      ATM Boost Coinstar, the coin counting kiosk maker hosting 3,500 Coinme bitcoin ATMs, is looking to double its bitcoin-capable supermarket locations. Placed in grocery stores and other businesses allowed to remain open during the COVID-19 shutdowns, Coinme reports a 40% bump in transaction volume since February.      Mass' Adoption Class Action The organizer of the canceled Massive Adoption crypto conference, Jacob Kostecki, is being sued over allegations that ticket refunds are too slow. The putative class action lawsuit was filed by a would-be attendee alleging fraud, breach of contract, conversion and unjust enrichment. Storied crypto lawyer David Silver is handling the case pro bono, while Kostecki claims refunds will be paid out by July 31, after announcing delays.      'Massive Fraud' The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued a Miami resident and two Israeli nationals Thursday over two ""massive fraudulent solicitation schemes,"" one of which focused on cryptocurrency services.      Exemption Legislation A key lawmaker in the California Assembly has proposed exempting “digital assets” that are “presumptively not an investment contract” from the state’s definition of corporate securities. Exactly how to treat digital assets under securities law has been a resoundingly inconclusive, and sometimes contradictory, debate in the U.S.      Series A Swiss crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse is raising a $280 million. (The Block)      Keybase Kayfabe? Zoom, the popular-by-necessity video conferencing service, has acquired crypto key directory Keybase in a bid to bring end-to-end encryption to its paying customers.

The price, paid by an anonymous bidder at a Sotheby’s auction for Edvard Munch’s “Scream,” smashed the record price for fine art set when Pablo Picasso’s “Nude, Green Leaves, and Bust” sold for $106.5 million two years earlier.      What was striking when I wrote about this eight years ago, was that the trend in the consumer price index was then extremely soft. The scourge was not inflation but employment-killing deflation. The Federal Reserve had slashed rates to zero and was spending hundreds of billions of freshly created dollars on government bonds in a mostly failing bid to recharge investment and consumer spending and drive CPI inflation up to its target rate of 2%.

An April 9 viral tweet showed that a similarly stark contrast is already playing out in the even harsher crisis of COVID-19. With its unlimited “quantitative easing,” or QE, campaign throwing trillions of dollars not only at Treasury debt but at risky “junk bonds” too, the Fed is handing Wall Street an asset inflation payoff while Main Street stares down the barrel of deflation.      As investor Preston Pysh points out in the first episode of The Breakdown’s “Money Reimagined” limited podcast series, the absence of mainstream inflation seems incongruous, even frustrating, to people – including many in the crypto community – who assume rampant central-bank money printing will destroy consumers’ spending power. They are looking, he says, in the wrong place: QE inflation will manifest not in the prices of everyday things but in assets owned by the wealthiest in society.      Like stocks. And Picassos.      “That’s where I think the ‘money printer go brrrrr’ meme is confusing a lot of people,” Pysh said, referring to a Crypto Twitter favorite inspired by this tweet from investor and Consensus: Distributed speaker Meltem Demirors “Because they are looking at the CPI bucket and you’re not going to see it there.”    The vicious dollar cycle      There’s a lesson here for bitcoin investors but before I get to that, let’s be blunt about society’s core problem. It is not consumer inflation, not for now, at least. It is the failure of a Wall Street-dependent monetary policy framework that socializes the losses and privatizes the profits of wealthy financiers while disenfranchising everyone else. As Pysh explains, the world economy is stuck in a broken cycle that stems from the world’s heavy addiction to dollars.      The reserve-currency dollar’s dominance of global credit markets ensures that during crises, it almost always experiences a self-fulfilling appreciation that helps nobody other than holders of U.S. financial assets. Overseas debtors scramble for greenbacks to make payments in response to skittish creditors’ margin calls, only to face even bigger problems as their depreciating local currencies make their dollar debts even harder to pay. The Fed has no choice but to flood the world with dollars to prevent markets from seizing up.      In the U.S., meanwhile, foreign inflows and the Fed’s emergency measures lead to lower interest rates, which lets the government roll over debts and make stimulus payments despite a dangerously expanding deficit. Washington’s loyalties being what they are, very little of those politically directed bailouts make their way into American consumers’ pockets. What they get – courtesy of the stronger dollar – is lower inflation, or even income-depleting deflation. Right now, burdened with student loans and credit card debt, that’s the last thing they need.    Digital asset inflation    What ordinary people most want, presumably, is a share in that sweet asset inflation that wealthy art collectors and stock investors enjoy.      One strategy for achieving that may lie with a brand new digital asset class, one that barely existed during the previous crisis but which now stands alongside rare art, gold and stocks as a potential beneficiary of the Fed’s unlimited stimulus spending. I’m talking, of course, about cryptocurrencies and, in particular, bitcoin.      Some of the logic behind demand for 19th century expressionist classics at times like this could apply to bitcoin. A key, but not only, reason why the price of rare works of art rises in crises – as well as Manhattan real estate, exclusive yachts, and stocks subject to company buybacks – is because, relative to the ever-increasing supply of stimulus dollars in financial asset owners’ bank accounts, these things are scarce. They have a measurably finite supply. It’s the luxury lifestyle version of Venezuelans dumping unwanted bolivars in return for cans of soup.      Now, for the first time, we have digital scarcity – assets whose supply cannot be randomly increased by someone who controls them even though they exist within the cut-and-paste world of the internet. Scarcity is the real problem that bitcoin solves. In fact, as odd as it might sound in a capitalist society that equates value with productive utility, bitcoin’s core value proposition is really just that it is provably scarce.    Next week’s anticipated halving in bitcoin’s issuance rate, an event no one can stop, reinforces this idea of provable, measurable scarcity. As investment firm Grayscale, a unit of New York-based Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company, puts it, bitcoin is undergoing “quantitative tightening” while central banks are doing “quantitative easinghttps://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Grayscale-Bitcoins-Quantitative-Tightening-vs.-Central-Banks-Quantitative-Easing-April-2020.pdf.”    Early Friday morning UTC, this new store-of-value asset, described by many as “digital gold,” jumped over $10,000 for the first time in two and a half months, though it couldn’t surpass the 2020 high of $10,598 from mid-February. (Notably, prices for physical gold, the world’s traditional scarce-supply safe haven, have regained all their lost ground and are now pushing toward the record highs they reached in 2011.) Either way, bitcoin’s strong gains through April and early May have revived the conversation around why, in this digital era, an asset of this kind holds value.      Bitcoin’s mathematically determined scarcity offers a direct counterpoint to the unbounded QE issuance of fiat currency, whose numbers are now so huge, writes Bloomberg’s Jared Dillian, that money is losing its meaning. And while there are forks of bitcoin that seek to compete with it, the oldest cryptocurrency’s two-third stake of all crypto market cap gives it, much like gold, a cultural status as the digital store of value.      Hugely influential hedge manager Paul Tudor Jones II seems to get the now. But you know what, unlike buying a Munch painting, you don’t need to be as rich as a hedge fund titan and be on an auctioneer’s privileged bidder list to buy bitcoin.    To infinity and beyond    Speaking of how the Fed is quantitatively easing while bitcoin is quantitatively tightening, check out this chart. Under its unlimited, unending asset-buying program – sometimes dubbed “QE Infinity,” the Fed is essentially buying everything its mandate allows it to buy. Between Feb. 26 and April 29, it has added an unprecedented $2.5 trillion to its balance sheet of bonds and other securities. For comparison, the previous most aggressive expansion period, between Sept. 10 and Nov. 12, 2008, when the Fed was backstopping banks and dealing with the swirling fallout from Lehman Brothers’ collapse, it added $1.3 trillion to its balance sheet. The scale now is mind-boggling.    The global town hall    There are signs of surging African interest in bitcoin. In this tweet thread, data scientist Matt Ahlborg uses interactive charts from Useful Tulips, the data visualization site he founded, to highlight sharp recent gains in the value of daily SubSaharan African transactions on peer-to-peer exchanges LocalBitcoins and Paxful. Volumes on those sites – which allow people to exchange bitcoin for fiat currencies directly with each other – reached a record dollar-equivalent volume exceeding $10 million on May 3. Part of that reflects the higher bitcoin price, but the extent and multi-country breadth of the move hints at bigger factors than market impact. Ahlborg declared, “Africa may have already taken over Latin America as the epicenter of utility Bitcoin usage globally. If you aren't paying attention to this market, you are WRONG!”      CoinDesk columnist John Paul Koning suggested Ahlborg’s definition of “utility” could be a stretch, as it might include normal speculation, scams and fraud. Even so, something is making Africans, across multiple countries, trade more bitcoin. Is this crisis related? A response to dollar shortages? I’m inclined to agree with Ahlborg on this: pay attention to Africa.      COVID-19 economic stimulus measures have varied greatly worldwide. Much like public health policy, they have been hastily delivered on a go-on-your-own-way basis because there simply was not time to coordinate internationally. (National coordination was hard enough.) The upside of all this is that in a year or so’s time, economists will have a nice pool of comparative data to measure what works and what doesn’t. When they get around to that, the COVID-19 Economic Stimulus Index developed by Ceyhun Elgin, Gokce Basbug and Abdullah Yalaman, could prove pretty useful. The three economists rapidly pulled together an analysis of 166 countries to produce a database of measures that cover six variables under three categories: fiscal policy, monetary policy, and balance of payment/exchange rate policy.      After a barrage of regulator criticism upon its launch last year, Libra’s leaders vowed to take note. It’s now clear they listened. After last month shifting the corporate consortium’s digital currency model away from its controversial basket-pegged system to one of single-currency stablecoins, Libra this week announced the appointment of a CEO with a resume that’s hard to beat if you need someone who can talk the talk with regulators. Before his appointment, Stuart Levey was Chief Legal Officer at HSBC, which had hired him explicitly to clean up the mess left by its massive money laundering scandal, for which it ended up paying a $1.9 billion fine. It’s pretty clear why HSBC had hired Levey: his previous job was as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence under both the Bush and Obama presidencies. Libra knows where its biggest battles lie.      Correction 5/10/20 1:40 p.m. UTC: This piece originally misspelled the name of the founder of Useful Tulips. The correct spelling is Matt Ahlborg.

42383613,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqDT,1588956321,"Binance Doesn’t Have a Headquarters Because Bitcoin Doesn’t, Says CEO","Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao really doesn't want to tell you where his firm's headquarters is located.      To kick off ConsenSys' Ethereal Summit on Thursday, Unchained Podcast host Laura Shin held a cozy fireside chat with Zhao who, to mark the occasion, was wearing a personalized football shirt emblazoned with the Binance brand.      Scheduled for 45 minutes, Zhao spent most of it explaining how libra and China's digital yuan were unlikely to be competitors to existing stablecoin providers; how Binance's smart chain wouldn't tread on Ethereum's toes – ""that depends on the definition of competing,"" he said – and how Binance had an incentive to keep its newly acquired CoinMarketCap independent from the exchange.      There were only five minutes left on the clock. Zhao was looking confident; he had just batted away a thorny question about an ongoing lawsuit. It was looking like the home stretch.      Then it hit. Shin asked the one question Zhao really didn't want to have to answer, but many want to know: Where is Binance's headquarters?      This seemingly simple question is actually more complex. Until February, Binance was considered to be based in Malta. That changed when the island European nation announced that, no, Binance is not under its jurisdiction. Since then Binance has not said just where, exactly, it is now headquartered.      Little wonder that when asked Zhao reddened; he stammered. He looked off-camera, possibly to an aide. ""Well, I think what this is is the beauty of the blockchain, right, so you don't have to ... like where's the Bitcoin office, because Bitcoin doesn't have an office,"" he said.      The line trailed off, then inspiration hit. ""What kind of horse is a car?"" Zhao asked. Binance has loads of offices, he continued, with staff in 50 countries. It was a new type of organization that doesn't need registered bank accounts and postal addresses.      ""Wherever I sit, is going to be the Binance office. Wherever I need somebody, is going to be the Binance office,"" he said.      See also: Binance Is Not Under Our Jurisdiction, Says Malta Regulator      Zhao may have been hoping the host would move onto something easier. But Shin wasn't finished: ""But even to do things like to handle, you know, taxes for your employees, like, I think you need a registered business entity, so like why are you obfuscating it, why not just be open about it like, you know, the headquarters is registered in this place, why not just say that?""      Zhao glanced away again, possibly at the person behind the camera. Their program had less than two minutes remaining. ""It's not that we don't want to admit it, it's not that we want to obfuscate it or we want to kind of hide it. We're not hiding, we're in the open,"" he said.      Shin interjected: ""What are you saying that you're already some kind of DAO [decentralized autonomous organization]? I mean what are you saying? Because it's not the old way [having a headquarters], it's actually the current way ... I actually don't know what you are or what you're claiming to be.""      Zhao said Binance isn't a traditional company, more a large team of people ""that works together for a common goal."" He added: ""To be honest, if we classified as a DAO, then there's going to be a lot of debate about why we're not a DAO. So I don't want to go there, either.""      ""I mean nobody would call you guys a DAO,"" Shin said, likely disappointed that this wasn't the interview where Zhao made his big reveal.      See also: Binance CEO Says Crypto Exchange Has Applied for a Singapore License      Time was up. For an easy question to close, Shin asked where Zhao was working from during the coronavirus pandemic.      ""I'm in Asia,"" Zhao said. The blank white wall behind him didn't provide any clues about where in Asia he might be. Shin asked if he could say which country – after all, it's the Earth's largest continent.      ""I prefer not to disclose that. I think that's my own privacy,"" he cut in, ending the interview.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | BNB,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/08/binance-doesnt-have-a-headquarters-because-bitcoin-doesnt-says-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a8bcd4a801ec8788b61b098e7151d2827c9029d-1500x911.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383624,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqOn,1588946400,How the COVID-19 Crisis Revived the Digital Dollar Debate,"Lawmakers have used the coronavirus crisis to revive the digital dollar debate. U.S. House and Senate bills proposed in March, which would allow individuals to hold checking accounts directly with the Federal Reserve, have renewed demand for a tech upgrade of the central bank’s issuance system.      Millions of U.S. taxpayers have waited for weeks for promised stimulus payments of up to $1,200 per person as the COVID-19 pandemic ripples into an economic crisis. While some received direct deposits in mid-April, those without bank accounts or a bank account on file with the Internal Revenue Service, who haven’t received a tax refund in recent years or who are married to an immigrant are still expecting that a check will arrive.      Proponents of digital dollars and central bank digital currencies say a digitized monetary system could solve the logistical question of how to quickly disburse large sums to many individuals with varying access to banking services. Others believe it would offer the state too much control.      Read more: Digital Dollars Give the State Too Much Control Over Money      How did we get here? Here’s a breakdown of what the proposed digital dollar is, how the coronavirus pandemic played a part in reigniting the conversation about central bank digital currencies and what it all means for the future of money:    What is a digital dollar?    A ""digital dollar,"" as defined by current congressional bills, is not a decentralized blockchain-based token, but rather a debt notation on a centralized ledger maintained by the Federal Reserve.      A U.S. digital dollar wouldn’t be a central bank digital currency, which itself isn’t exactly a cryptocurrency. It would not be decentralized; on the contrary, it would be issued by the Fed. A centralized database (run by the Fed or another entity) would securely track consumer and business balances, and people could access funds through digital dollar wallets, which would also be managed by the Fed.    How did COVID-19 renew the digital dollar debate?    In the U.S., the need to distribute economic stimulus payments has driven a renewed interest in digital dollars. Lawmakers tried to create a mandate for the Fed to create digital dollars to disburse funds from the country’s$2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package, a complicated challenge since the infrastructure for this doesn’t yet exist.      Read more: From Facebook Lab to Global Stage: Libra's Timeline      Under the current system, Americans have to wait for direct deposits or physical checks to arrive from the U.S. Treasury Dept. Banks can legally withhold funds from stimulus deposits into accounts with negative balances, something the CARES Act doesn’t limit.      At the same time, physical cash can be a petri dish of germs, no less during a global pandemic. The likelihood of COVID-19 being transmitted via banknotes is unclear, but other countries have been cautious. South Korea temporarily took banknotes coming into its central bank out of circulation, while China deep-cleaned its cash with high temperatures and ultraviolet light — an approach that destroyed some notes.      The proposals before Congress in March would have charged the Fed with issuing both digital dollars and digital wallets that would give Americans direct access to the funds.      While those proposals didn’t make it to the final stimulus package act, they opened a window for a broader conversation around a central bank-issued currency, especially as government payments to struggling Americans and small businesses have been delayed by bureaucracy and logistics.      See also: Chris Giancarlo: Don't Rush Digital Dollar During COVID-19      Lawmakers eventually decided to make payments by direct deposit, using the bank account information citizens had used for tax refunds. However, anyone who didn’t have account information on file with the IRS — or didn’t have an account at all — must wait for a physical check to arrive.      It took weeks for the government to begin issuing payments, and some Americans waiting for physical checks may not see funds for months. Those without bank accounts — who may need the cash the most — are likely to experience the longest wait times.      Read more: 4 Ways COVID-19 Will Normalize Digital Currency      The digital dollars U.S. Sens. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) had floated would, in theory, have simplified the process of distributing stimulus payments, but the lack of an established payment system would have presented its own challenges. The technology for a Federal Reserve-issued digital dollar doesn’t exist yet, and many legal questions must be answered before it can be designed.    What are the pros and cons of a CBDC?    The digital dollar debate, and recent actions by China and other nations, are also rekindling the discussions around a central bank digital currency at large.      A central bank-issued digital currency could bring a number of benefits to users, including greater financial inclusion, more efficient payment systems and more options for managing monetary policy, according to the International Monetary Fund.      With the backing of a trusted government, central bank digital currencies may limit the adoption of privately issued currencies like stablecoins, such as Tether, that can be a challenge to regulate, the IMF has said.      See also: How a Flurry of 'Digital Dollar' Proposals Made It to Congress      But CBDCs aren’t without risks. Banks could see their role as financial intermediaries minimized, and central banks could see their balance sheets balloon, the IMF notes. A bloated balance sheet could make it harder for a central bank to manage inflation over time, particularly as the economy improves.      Digital currencies could be costly for central banks to maintain and may ultimately threaten to cost central banks their reputations by involving them in so many steps along the payment chain. Central banks could suddenly become subject to consumer sentiment while having to maintain stringent anti-money laundering practices.    Who else is developing CBDCs?    China continues to signal its commitment to creating a digital version of the yuan. One of its state-owned banks has been testing an interface for a digital yuan. The country is piloting a “DC/EP,” or “digital currency/electronic payment,” in four cities to replace some of its cash supply.      Separately, six central banks joined forces this year to share knowledge as they research the potential for CBDCs. The working group with the Bank for International Settlements includes the European Central Bank and central banks in Sweden, Canada, Switzerland, the U.K., and Japan. Among them, the Bank of Canada said it hasn't found a compelling case to issue a CBDC while the Bank of England has left the door open, saying it sees private companies playing a larger part in the issuance and distribution of money.      Meanwhile, South Korea's central bank in early April launched a 22-month pilot program to assess the implications of moving toward digital cash.    Where does the U.S. digital dollar stand?    The Federal Reserve has publicly talked about digital currencies for over a year, and it has been clear the development of one would be fraught with challenges.      “Unlike social media platforms or ridesharing applications, payment systems cannot be designed as they develop, due to the nexus with consumers' financial security,” Fed governor Lael Brainard said in a December speech.      Read more: Digital Dollars Can Reduce Unemployment, Here's How      “Circumstances where the central bank issues digital currency directly to consumer accounts for general-purpose use would raise profound legal, policy and operational questions,” she said. “That said, it is important to study whether we can do more to provide safer, less expensive, faster, or otherwise more efficient payments.”      The Fed is working on its FedNow Service, a real-time payment service that could enable financial institutions to more quickly and cheaply transfer value than currently possible. While FedNow is not the same as the proposed digital dollar, let alone a CBDC, the service would bring U.S. financial rails one step closer to that vision.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Meena Thiruvengadam,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/08/how-the-covid-19-crisis-revived-the-digital-dollar-debate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/150797c2bca59210c15b42ff6a23fb973e5cdba6-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383629,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqWL,1588944600,Bitcoin in Emerging Markets: Latin America,"In advance of her “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel at Consensus: Distributed on May 11, Leigh Cuen is writing a three-part column on how cryptocurrencies are used in the developing world. The first installment explored bitcoin adoption in the Middle East and the second covered Africa.      Some believe the broader economic crisis might lead to “dollarization” in emerging markets, where people increasingly use global currencies like dollars instead of their local fiat.      It remains unclear how bitcoin will play into that prospective shift, as bitcoin is still too immature to be predominately used as a competing currency. But crypto entrepreneurs are still giving it a try anyway.      The Colombia-based startup Valiu offers Latin Americans access to remittances and bitcoin-backed, synthetic dollar savings accounts. This means you can send fiat across borders and, when you’re not cashing out, the value is denominated in dollars by behind-the-scenes bitcoin derivatives.      Register: Leigh Cuen Hosts “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” on May 11 at Consensus: Distributed      When the startup partnered with the Open Money Initiative for market research, it found demand from members of the Venezuelan diaspora for fiat remittances and dollar-denominated savings spurred by Venezuela’s pre-coronavirus economic collapse.      “We have a trading and risk engine where we buy and sell bitcoin, that’s how we provide the service,” Valiu CEO Simon Chamorro said.      Users can pay in debit, credit or even cash to get into the system, Chamorro added. Bitcoin is then used to transfer value on the backend. “It was an incomplete solution to offer [pesos-to-bolivar] remittances because as soon as they received the money, they had to spend it,” he said. “We knew we needed a dollar solution.”      So far, in 2020, the Valiu mobile app garnered 40,000 downloads and roughly 5,000 monthly active users. Chamorro said there’s also growing demand from Mexico and Argentina because, like Venezuela and Colombia, these nations are experiencing high inflation and are home to many migrant communities.      Indeed, researcher Matt Ahlborg wrote LocalBitcoins users in Argentina set new record highs this week with more than $105,000 in daily volume on LocalBitcoins.    Stablecoin solace    Meanwhile, dollar-denominated stablecoins offer another type of dollarization. Argentinian crypto exchange founder Federico Ogue, CEO of Buenbit and Buendolar, said many users who are buying cryptocurrency for the first time are attracted to dollar-denominated stablecoins, like dai. This is also thanks, in part, to active marketing campaigns supported by the Maker Foundation.      These new clients tend to buy small amounts, Ogue said. Even so, he said there were so many new users during the lockdown that volumes nearly doubled on the peak day in April.      With regards to bitcoin, Ahlborg’s tally of volumes from both Paxful and LocalBitcoins show peer-to-peer trading volumes in Argentina may be growing at a slower rate than other Latin American crypto hubs like Venezuela or Colombia. So far, it appears MakerDAO may be the most widely promoted altcoin project in both Argentina and Brazil. Over in Brazil, the Stellar-based Moeda Marketplace spun up a food market during the coronavirus crisis.      The startup works with agricultural companies like Agro Organic to offer 80 different food products with a two-day delivery time. In the first few weeks of operation, the startup earned $20,000, serving 300 customers. Next, the plan is to expand to several major cities in Brazil.    More coverage of cryptocurrency in Latin America:  Venezuela Isn’t the Crypto Use Case You Want It to Be  MakerDAO Is Helping 60 Kids in Brazil Learn the Basics of Blockchain  What’s Holding Back Bitcoin in Venezuela? This Group Is Investigating  Brazil    Unlike Venezuela and Argentina, which were already embroiled in an economic crisis, Brazil’s economy was relatively stable before the coronavirus hit.      As such, crypto adoption has been much lower in Brazil despite its size. The local stock market provided sufficient investment opportunities for traders, without needing to look abroad. Plus, Binance’s Brazil communications lead, Mayra Siqueira, said bitcoin has a reputation problem in her homeland. Before the pandemic, people overwhelmingly associated cryptocurrency with scams and quick riches.      Siqueira said there are roughly 60 crypto exchanges operating in Brazil, out of which the leading exchange has only opened 1.5 million accounts to date. But awareness is growing, Siqueira said, with Binance onboarding 16% more Brazilian users in Q1 2020 than in Q4 2019.      Now that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is leaning toward “authoritarian” tendencies, she said, more people are looking to bitcoin as a long-term savings option or a way to transact across borders.      “There’s a fear that we might be becoming a dictatorship again,” Siqueira said, referencing the military regime that gripped Brazil for two decades until 1985. “We’re not seeing international investment coming to Brazil any time soon because we’re politically unstable. We’re going to see more crypto adoption because of that.”      In some ways, Moeda is an example of that. The token project leverages global platforms like Binance for small loans and operational liquidity while serving local clients in Brazil.    CoinDesk senior reporter Leigh Cuen hosts the “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel on May 11 at 7:30 p.m. ET at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's first virtual, free conference. Register here.  Cross-border fundraising    Rosine Kadamani, founder of the educational Blockchain Academy in Brazil, described Moeda as Brazil’s first “true initial coin offering” back in 2017. Since then, the startup has worked with small businesses in ways that “represent an interesting gain for all the involved.”      Critics might argue Moeda doesn’t need a token to serve these Brazilian businesses. Regardless, the company appears to be performing like other comparable tech providers in the region. Plus, Moeda CEO Miss Reis was already working with agricultural cooperatives for years before the crisis hit.      Unlike dai adoption, which is promoted by the Maker Foundation, the Stellar Foundation is not affiliated with Moeda in any way. As such, the Brazilian case illustrates that crypto usage in “emerging markets” isn’t uniform at all.      Although some Brazilians have already lost their life savings in ill-advised crypto investments, Siqueira said, that doesn’t mean altcoin projects in emerging markets are inherently exploitative or artificial.    Inflation issues    Sometimes inflation drives crypto adoption, especially when paired with weak banking infrastructure. But Siqueira said Brazilians trust banks more than they do in Argentina, for example. In this case, it’s not that bitcoin users generally distrust local banks. Instead, there’s simply higher demand for accessible and transparent loan services than there is local supply.      So some entrepreneurs take initiative on their own and use altcoins to find international lenders or investors interested in small-to-medium scale opportunities. Digital payments, in general, make it cheaper and easier to transact across borders. So a modest profit can be more attractive to lenders and investors abroad. Someday traditional institutions may be more accessible. As of today, cryptocurrency provides a workaround.      Jorge Farias, a Venezuelan expat and CEO of the Panama-based startup Cryptobuyer, said this year his company plans to establish 20,000 crypto-friendly point-of-sale devices across Venezuela. This bitcoin business also supports altcoins like ether and dai, because it’s profitable for Cryptobuyer to do so. Other bitcoin companies are interested in supporting tokens as well.      “We’re not closing the door on stablecoins. We can also use them as collateral,” Chamorro said of trendy altcoins like dai.      As for Chamorro’s case in Colombia, he said his startup’s $1.25 million raise from Y Combinator in San Francisco went a lot further than it might for competitors because most of his staff lives in Latin America. Across the board, all parties agreed access to education is the crucial factor that enables adoption, not scams.      “Brazil requires more education,” Binance’s Siqueria said. “As soon as we see a better fiat offering in Brazil, we’ll see a lot of growth.”    CoinDesk senior reporter Leigh Cuen hosts the “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel on May 11 at 7:30 p.m. ET at Consensus: Distributed, CoinDesk's first virtual, free conference.

42383623,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqQ3,1588943571,The CoinDesk 50: Brave Browser Delivered and BAT’s a DeFi Darling,"Crypto loves a troublemaker. When the Brave browser debuted in 2016, the Newspaper Association of America(NAA) sent it a cease and desist letter:      “You are hereby notified that Brave’s plan to replace our clients’ paid advertising content with its own advertising violates the law, and the undersigned publishers intend to fully enforce their rights.”      Four years later, Brave is still going strong (while the NAA changed its name). At the end of 2019, the browser had more than 10 million monthly active users.      Brave’s founder, Brendan Eich, previously led Mozilla and watched what the surveillance economy was doing to the internet. As web users will tell you, looking at ads isn’t really the problem; it’s that the ads look back.    This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.    The plan for Brave was to break that model by delivering ads directly to internet users and then rewarding them for their attention when they chose to give it. Thus, the Basic Attention Token (BAT) was born amid the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017. Brave’s modest (for the time) $35 million token sale sold out in seconds.      “Out of all ‘utility’ tokens on Ethereum, BAT is one of the few that backs a finished product – the Brave browser,” Lucas Nuzzi of Coin Metrics told CoinDesk in an email.      Beyond delivering a more private experience with the Brave browser, BAT won acceptance from key market players in the past year. It was one of the first five cryptocurrencies that decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Compound accepted as collateral at launch. It became the second asset, after ether (ETH), that MakerDAO accepted as collateral for generating dai loans.      Delivering on its promise to launch a new ad platform in April 2019 seems to have made a difference. Shortly thereafter, venture capitalists gave Brave a fresh $30 million to keep going. But consumer opt-ins to the ad network have not exploded, perhaps because the returns are small and users have to go through Uphold to get paid. It’s a lot of friction.      “The number of addresses with a balance greater than 0, which is seen by many as a proxy for adoption, is still somewhat flat,” Nuzzi said. That figure has been hovering around 100,000 since the launch of Brave ads last April, with only a slow, gradual increase, according to Coin Metrics data.      Users may not think the rewards have proven to be worth the trouble. Still, the long-tail approach may be a winning, if unsexy, strategy for Brave’s long-term relevance.      Regardless, the ad blocking it launched with still works great.",POSITIVE,BAT | ETH,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/08/the-coindesk-50-brave-browser-delivered-and-bats-a-defi-darling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3dddca08ef986f782e7c71ec3dced3380d6eb205-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Seychelles-based crypto exchange said Wednesday the BTCDOM contract would allow investors to bet on bitcoin's dominance rate – a metric for determining the market's bitcoin value versus the value of other cryptocurrencies.      The first of its kind, BTCDOM is a perpetual swap – a future without expiry date – that relies on a proprietary Bitcoin Dominance Index, comprised of seven of bitcoin's most liquid trading pairs, including those with large-cap coins, such as ether, EOS, litecoin and XRP.      See also: Major Crypto Exchanges Bitfinex and OKEx Hit by Service Denial Attacks      Bitfinex says the contract provides investors with a less-volatile form of exposure compared to a plain-vanilla bitcoin contract because it references bitcoin to a broader basket of digital assets. That means that while the value of the contract obviously changes on the bitcoin price, it takes into consideration the broader performance of the whole asset-class, which remains highly correlated.

42383630,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xqTp,1588940857,Open Positions on Bitcoin Options Pass $1B for First Time,"Open contracts on bitcoin options rose to record highs on Thursday as the cryptocurrency’s price rose into five figures.      Data from major exchanges – Deribit, LedgerX, Bakkt, OKEx, and CME – shows that open interest on options rose above $1 billion, surpassing the previous all-time high of $970 million registered on Feb. 14, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      The metric has increased sharply from the low of $410 million observed in March when the bitcoin market crashed on ""Black Thursday,"" March 12.      Deribit, the world's biggest crypto options exchange by volume, contributed nearly 90% of the total on Thursday as open positions on the Panama-based exchange reached a record high of $903 million.      Global options trading volume also jumped to $213.7 million yesterday, the highest level since the March 12 crash, while bitcoin itself clocked a two-month high of $10,062 on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price index. At press time, bitcoin had dropped back to near $9,830, representing a 1.5% drop on the day, but an over 10% gain on a week-to-date basis.      Options are derivative contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the purchaser the right to buy, while the put option gives the buyer the right to sell.      Open interest refers to the number of options contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment. While open interest represents the number of contracts open at a given point of time, trading volume refers to the number of contracts traded during a specific period.      The surge in open interest looks to have been caused by increased demand for put options, or bearish bets.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      “Post-March crash, put options have been bought for downside protection primarily. As the market has rallied, more interest has entered via increased put accumulation,” said Tony Stewart, a derivatives trader and analyst in Deribit’s Market Insights channel.      Validating Stewart's argument is the one-month put-call skew’s recent rise from -3% to 9.1%. The positive figure indicates that put options are costlier due to drawing greater demand than calls. Similar sentiments are being echoed by the put-call ratio, which rose to a 10-month high of 0.81 on Monday, according to Skew data.      The put bias seen in the options market suggests investors may be hedging for a potential post-halving price drop. Bitcoin is set to undergo its third mining reward halving on Tuesday, following which the reward per block mined will drop to 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.      That the supply-altering event is a long-term bullish development has been extensively discussed by the analyst community for many months. Bitcoin’s price has rallied by nearly 160% since bottoming out at $3,867 in March and has recently decoupled from traditional markets as hype over the event mounts.      Such strong rallies ahead of major events are often followed by price pullbacks. Historical data shows the cryptocurrency suffered a 30% drop in the four weeks following its second reward halving, which took place on July 9, 2016.      “We may see the market drop by 25%-35% from the peak, but we expect it to be followed by a period of range-bound trading over a number of months and then a gradual move back up. The longer-term horizon for bitcoin is extremely bullish but in the short-to-medium term, we think we’ll see a lot of disappointed players out there,” said Ed Hindi, CIO of Tyr Capital Arbitrage SP, which focuses on liquidity provision and arbitrage within the cryptocurrency markets.      See also: Bitcoin Breaches $10K for First Time Since February      Hence, it's not surprising that trades are buying hedges (puts) against long positions in the spot or futures market.      Bitcoin is widely expected to remain bid over the weekend due to ""FOMO"" buying from retail investors. FOMO, or fear of missing out, refers to panic buying in a rising market.      Until the halving has passed, more price rises look likely. “$10,000 has already been breached and the psychological resistance of that has been overcome. We are keeping our eye on $10,500 as the next key level,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

The cryptocurrency is now up 39% year to date, triple the returns for gold, which is seen by many investors in traditional markets as a hedge against inflation. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks is down 11%.      Paul Tudor Jones II, the hedge-fund magnate known for correctly predicting the 1987 stock-market crash, told Bloomberg News Thursday his $38 billion Tudor Investment Corp. is putting money into bitcoin futures.      “I am not a hard-money nor a crypto nut,” Jones told clients in a market outlook note titled, ""The Great Monetary Inflation."" But the ""best profit-maximizing strategy is to own the fastest horse,"" he wrote.      “If I am forced to forecast, my bet is it will be bitcoin,” according to Jones. “The most compelling argument for owning bitcoin is the coming digitization of currency everywhere, accelerated by COVID-19.”      Such growing interest reflects how the size of the cryptocurrency market – and the industry supporting it – has ballooned over the past four years. In 2017, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance reckoned there were about 2,000 people working in the entire digital-asset industry. Fast forward to 2020 and companies like Kraken and Coinbase are hiring hundreds of people at a time.      Trading activity is also up. CryptoCompare released data this week showing the second-highest trading volumes on record was on April 30:      Some $66.2 billion worth of cryptocurrencies changed hands that day, second only to the $75.9 billion traded during March 12's 39% price plunge, when the economic devastation from the coronavirus suddenly became clear to traders in both digital and traditional asset markets.      According to Lewis Harland, founder at analytics site Formal Verification: “Higher volumes in the futures market in terms of open interest point to perhaps a greater interest from institutions.”      There's also been an increase in the number of trading products and instruments offered in the fast-growing market.      Last month, the cryptocurrency derivatives platform FTX introduced a token that allows investors to trade bitcoin volatility.      And, this week, Bitfinex released a perpetual swap giving exposure to bitcoin dominance – essentially the market share occupied by the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, relative to the overall digital-asset market.      21Shares, which sponsors exchange-traded products tracking cryptocurrencies, launched a new token via its Amun arm that rises in value whenever bitcoin's price falls, and vice versa.      If the last two halvings are any indication, next week will see an upswing in volatility, offering rich opportunities for traders to take advantage. In the meantime, many are preparing by creating preferred exposure and using products to hedge or take positions on a specific market move.      Traders will continuously adjust their positions ahead of the big day, and soon enough the price action will separate winners from losers. Some investors think the halving will drive bitcoin a lot higher; others say an event that's been in the works for 11 years is so well-known that it's already baked into the price.      What's beyond dispute is how fast this market is growing. The spike in interest in the halving might just be another reflection of that.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,861 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,999 | 24-Hr Low: $9,961      Trend: Bitcoin bulls are taking a breather so far on Friday, having engineered a rally to two-month highs above $10,000 on Thursday.      At press time, the top cryptocurrency by market value is trading around $9,860, down 0.5% on the day. The bulls failed to keep prices above key resistance at $10,048 during overnight trading. That level marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the drop from the June 2019 high of $13,880 to the March 2020 low of $3,867.      The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, or the golden ratio, is widely tracked by chart analysts and traders. Hence, a move above that hurdle could cause more buyers to join the market.      Observers suggest the pullback seen over the last few hours could be temporary and prices will likely find acceptance above the Fibonacci hurdle ahead of the mining reward halving due on Monday. ""We'll go higher this weekend because of FOMO by retail investors"" said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.      FOMO, or fear of missing out, refers to an emotional reaction that pushes traders to invest in a less disciplined way. As prices rise, more and more investors become concerns they will miss out on the opportunity to buy the asset at attractive prices. That fear forces them to invest in a less-disciplined way and leads to stronger price gains.      Many in the investor community believe bitcoin's imminent halving will put bitcoin on a long-term bull run and are likely to keep buying while heading into the event.      A convincing break above $10,048 would shift the focus to the next major resistance at $10,385. That level is currently housing the trendline falling from December 2017 and June 2019 highs.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Paddy Baker, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/08/first-mover-search-interest-in-bitcoins-halving-reaches-fever-pitch-as-price-hits-10k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4bee5ca91d461284ceedb26dd6261f1942fc086c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Vietnam-based bank is the latest financial institution to join Contour's network with a view to streamlining the issuance of letters of credit with the use of a blockchain and smart contracts, local media reported on Tuesday.      Contour is a blockchain trade platform built on R3's Corda tech and designed to streamline transaction settlement processes. It rebranded from Voltron in late January 2020, naming R3's Asia chief Carl Wegner as CEO in the run-up to a full commercial launch of its digitized letter-of-credit (LoC) service.      A letter of credit refers to a formal letter from a bank that essentially guarantees a buyer's payment to a seller within a specific time frame. If for some reason the transaction fails, the letter obligates the bank to cover the full amount of the purchase.      See also: Nasdaq Is Using R3’s Corda for Managing Digital Assets      Historically, letters of credit have been on paper, which is costly in time and manual processing. Putting the process on a blockchain could streamline the process, allowing letters to be issued in real time in a secure and private manner utilizing process automation provided by smart contracts.      “The focus with our network has always been to establish a neutral platform that all different types of banks and corporates can use for trade finance transactions,"" Wegner said in a statement.

According to a source close to Zhan, who was ousted by his rival co-founder Wu Jihan last October, the former executive was recently granted the right to recover his status as the legal representative of Beijing Bitmain Technology by the Beijing Haidian District Justice Bureau.      On Friday morning local time, as Zhan attended the bureau to collect his new registration license as part of the recovery process, he was surrounded by dozens of men including Bitmain’s Chief Executive Liu Luyao, according to the source, who was at the scene at the time.      According to a report by Chinese news source Caixin on Friday, as officials from the Justice Bureau attempted to hand over the updated license to Zhan as the firm's new legal representative, Liu abruptly took possession of the license, saying, “The business license is company property, how can it fall in to the hands of an individual?""      According to a video circulating on WeChat seen and verified by CoinDesk, the tensions between the two sides later escalated into a physical confrontation. After the Justice Bureau reported the incident to the police, both parties were taken to the local police station.      The confrontation marks the latest development in Bitmain's internal struggle following last year's sudden coup, and deepens the uncertainties surrounding the firm's senior management ahead of a planned initial public offering in the U.S.      Zhan's latest partial legal victory returning his legal representative status followed an another win last month. A legal representative for a Chinese company usually holds broad powers to act on a company's behalf.      In a statement issued by Bitmain on Friday, the company takes its aim at the Justice Bureau, saying the decision to reverse the registration is a ""mistake"" made by the government agency that ""has severely violated the Company Law [of China].""      ""We recognize Liu Luyao as the currently effective legal representative of Beijing Bitmain,"" the firm said. ""During this period, we will not acknowledge any action taken by Zhan Ketuan as a legal representative of Beijing Bitmain and reserve the rights to file legal claims against Zhan and related parties.""      However, the internal fight to control the world's largest bitcoin miner make is far from over.

42431892,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Hrh,1588928400,'Massive Adoption' Conference Organizer Sued After Refund Delays,"The organizer of the canceled Massive Adoption crypto conference, which boasted a potential audience of 1,500, is being sued over allegations that ticket refunds are too slow.      The putative class action lawsuit was filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado by Ashley Gentry, a would-be attendee of Massive Adoption, and alleges fraud, breach of contract, conversion and unjust enrichment. The suit is calling for the organizer, Jacob Kostecki, to refund would-be attendees, as well as punitive damages and the costs of the lawsuit. David Silver, the attorney who filed the lawsuit, told CoinDesk he was doing so pro bono, and would not be accepting payment or fees for the case.      Silver has long been active in the crypto space, and has filed suit against Cryptsy, BitConnect, YouTube and the Tezos Foundation in the past. Crypto exchange Coinbase participated in a settlement connected to the Cryptsy case.      Also read: I Attended a Bitcoin Conference in VR and Still Got Sick      Kostecki originally planned Massive Adoption for November 2019, but rescheduled to late February 2020. He canceled the event by the end of January 2020, however, and promised refunds to customers. An update on his website said he had ""inadequate funding,"" and fewer guests and sponsors than he needed to maintain the event.      A later update on his website, which went down for some time between February 2020 and late April, said, ""Due to a series of local conditions, global markets, operator errors and mistakes the conference was cancelled late January.""      Kostecki said in the update he had begun processing refunds in March, and would continue through July 2020. A countdown clock on the updated site appears to be counting down to Friday, July 31, 2020. Kostecki did not immediately return a request for comment.      Silver told CoinDesk via email that, ""we approached Mr. Kostecki several weeks ago with a simple offer to resolve the debts he has already acknowledged he owes to the would-be Massive Adoption attendees.""      In April 2020, Silver tweeted that he would work with any attendees owed under $1,000 for free to ensure refunds. At the time, Kostecki responded, ""If you believe that this will accelerate the relief to ticket holders instead of hinder it then that is your decision.""      Kostecki declined the offer, Silver said.      In the new update to his website, Kostecki said ""the reaction to Covid-19 has delayed refunds vs internal milestones,"" a claim he has also previously made on Twitter.      See also: Coronavirus Concerns Cause Another Crypto Event to Be Postponed      In his most recent tweet, dated April 26, on an account dedicated to Massive Adoption, Kostecki said, ""Refunds continue being made,"" and that he had been in touch with ""dozens of people"" over the past two months. He maintained that he would meet his July 31 deadline.      The lawsuit is being filed as a putative class action because some of the would-be attendees have small claims, and may not be able to file individual lawsuits, Thursday's filing claimed.      ""We are still willing to work with Mr. Kostecki on formulating a quick and simple resolution, but the fact that we filed the lawsuit shows that Mr. Kostecki’s hollow Twitter promises are not enough,"" Silver said.

42431896,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Hzh,1588924800,Coinstar Plans Massive Expansion of Coinme Bitcoin ATMs as Usage Spikes 40%,"Coinstar, the coin counting kiosk maker hosting 3,500 Coinme bitcoin ATMs, is looking to double its cash-for-bitcoin capable supermarket machines.      The doubling would happen ""within a year,"" Vice President of Product Michael Jack told CoinDesk. He said Coinme bitcoin ATM growth ""both on a per location and overall basis, has been very strong.""      The company already has plans to plug Coinme's exchange API into more kiosks, though Jack did not specify how soon this would happen. Coinstar has a global fleet of nearly 20,000 kiosks, according to its website.      The deliberations come as Coinme lays claim to a veritable accomplishment of the COVID-19 era: It's bringing in new customers, even while other businesses flounder. Coinme CEO Neil Bergquist told CoinDesk that 40% of transactions since late February are by first-timers.      One reason for the surge may be the placement of Coinme bitcoin ATMs almost exclusively in supermarkets and pharmacies, just about the only brick-and-mortar establishments that remained open to consumer foot traffic through COVID-19 lockdowns.      Read more: Bitcoin ATMs Expand Despite Shelter-in-Place Rules      That twist of fate let Coinme ""provide uninterrupted access"" to customers, Bergquist said.      As panicking shoppers flocked to grocery stores in mid-March on lockdown supply runs, some were apparently also bulking up on crypto: Bitcoin transaction volume at Coinme kiosks is up 40% since late February.      Coinme also saw a “slight uptick” in $1,200 transactions – the same dollar amount as coronavirus stimulus checks sent to Americans by the Treasury Dept. – “although we're not seeing a strong correlation,” Bergquist said.      “The recent increase in sales certainly helped remove any concerns around company performance and durability during the pandemic,” Bergquist said.    Cash injection    The news immediately follows Coinme's Thursday announcement that it had raised $10 million in Series A funding from Coinstar, Blockchain.com Ventures, Hard Yaka, Nima Capital and Pantera Capital, who led the ongoing round with $5.5 million. Pantera now controls a seat on the Coinme board of directors.      Even before the spike, Pantera partner Paul Veradittakit said his VC firm likes Coinme’s boots on the ground business model. He said it appeals to consumers curious about bitcoin and who are certainly familiar with the concept of ATMs but perhaps not ready to open an account with an online exchange.      “People aren't there yet in terms of education, people aren't there in terms of technology,” he said. “This is the way to get the mainstream user, the general public, the folks that are going to grocery stores” to buy bitcoin.      Bergquist said Coinme would use the cash to expand its business in Latin America. Because it builds an exchange API rather than an actual machines, Coinme can plug bitcoin buying into just about any compatible device: “kiosks, ATMs, [Point of Sale], and merchants” in Latin American countries, Bergquist said.      “They want to be the backend, they want to be the pipes to make money move around the world in a much more seamless way,” said Veradittakit.

The proposal, introduced Tuesday as an amendment to legislation first submitted by Majority Leader Ian Calderon (D-57), would free “digital assets” that are “presumptively not an investment contract” from the definition of security and all the regulatory baggage that label carries.      Exactly how to separate digital assets from securities law has been a resoundingly inconclusive debate in the U.S., where officials define the vast ecosystem of crypto products in different, sometimes contradictory ways from one agency to the next. Those differences have led to multiple court battles over the applicability of the “Howey test” to digital assets.      Calderon’s legislation tries to end that debate, according to Michael Magee, a legislative aide.      ""It addresses one of the most common instances of ambiguity with cryptocurrency and the law: how to determine if a digital asset is an investment contract, and therefore subject to securities laws,"" Magee said to CoinDesk in an email.      If passed, Calderon's legislation set what appears to be a clear framework for determining whether digital assets are investment contracts – at least on the state level.      The asset must not be acquired in exchange for payment, fiat or otherwise; it must be used on a “fully operational network” for a “consumptive purpose;” and its value “does not rely on the managerial effort of others” (a key feature of the Howey test).      Within that last point, the legislation points to decentralized consensus as evidence of whether a digital asset is independent from an “identifiable person, project team, or management entity” that would otherwise contribute “managerial efforts.” Network-led software changes and proof-of stake voting rights must be present.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/08/california-assembly-considers-exempting-some-digital-assets-from-state-securities-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0da12633c7442f3f249312ba45e9b3561e2db4c-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
