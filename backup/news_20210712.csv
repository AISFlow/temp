In his note, Nance said that investors turned off by COIN’s post-listing slump – shares are down more than 25% from their peak – could start “reengaging in the coming quarters.” Coinbase listed its shares on Nasdaq in April.

42406914,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8VEv,1626122915,Why Crypto Miners Are Expanding Beyond Quebec,"UPDATE (July 13, 2021, 03:25 UTC): After this article was published, Bitfarms said through a spokesperson that it wasn't planning to leave the Quebec province, but rather there is a physical limitation on how much energy it can use for mining due to a 2017-era regulation and so it has expansion plans beyond the province. The headline and subheading have been updated.      With abundant sources of clean, renewable energy, for years Quebec was an ideal place to mine bitcoin. But leading miners there don't see it that way now.      With the Canadian province implementing stricter regulation out of concern for bitcoin’s energy impact, miners are getting ready to leave the country for other sources of power.      Bitfarms, a Nasdaq and TSX-listed company, is one of Canada’s largest bitcoin miners. Currently, all its operations are in Quebec, but not for much longer.      “Because of the rules and the restrictions that they put in place, it’s very limited growth opportunities in Quebec, at least as the policies currently are,” said Bitfarms Chief Mining Officer Ben Gagnon.      Bitfarms, which currently has a market cap of $700 million, saw its revenue increase 200% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period a year earlier. With growth there comes the need for expansion, but for Bitfarms that won’t take place in Quebec.      Back in 2017, as bitcoin's price peaked near $20,000, Quebec was the subject of an increasing amount of interest from Chinese miners. China had cracked down heavily on coal-powered mining, closing down over 100 coal plants in China. The Canadian province has many hydroelectric dams, which makes electricity in the area not just cheap but suitable for a greener future.      “It scared the province and the utilities,” Gagnon said. In 2018, Quebec had to temporarily stop selling power to miners because the province needed to save the electricity for its residents.      Demand hasn’t slowed since then. Earlier this year, the province asked its crypto customers to lower their energy consumption by 95% for up to 300 hours in the winter. Quebec said it needed the power for the heating needs of its residents.      “The measures put in place were aimed at controlling their impact on local demand in Quebec,” a spokesperson for HydroQuebec, the utility, told CoinDesk in an email. “[We] must look at the overall picture and manage its surpluses responsibly in order to align with the aspirations of Quebec society.”      Bitfarms reacted with its feet, seeking alternative locations for its specialist machinery. Expansions to other regions are set to begin this year, Bitfarms confirmed to CoinDesk in an email.      In October, the company signed a deal for a new mining plant in Argentina, CEO Emiliano Grodzki's home country; the plant will start operating in 2022. It will allow Bitfarms to draw up to 210 megawatts of electricity at its own discretion and at a rate of only $0.02 per kWh. For new cryptocurrency miners in Quebec the equivalent rate is as high as $0.15 now. That’s more than enough reason to see the South American country as a future mining haven.    Read more: Bitfarms Plans 210 MW Bitcoin Mining Facility in Argentina    “There’s a good opportunity for us to move in there, take over the entire power plant and build a large-scale mining operation at power costs that are half our power costs in Quebec,” Gagnon said.      Another Canadian cryptocurrency miner, Hive Blockchain Technologies, recently announced a new mining facility in Sweden, increasing the number of operation centers in the Scandinavian country to four as part of the company’s “growth strategy in Sweden.” The country now supplies Hive with 33MW of power and surpasses Quebec, which used to be the company’s biggest supplier of energy, according to data on Hive’s website. Hive did not reply to an email seeking comment.      Bitfarms isn’t going to be slowed down by energy regulators. “This is a race,” CEO Grodzki said. “Our goal needs to be continuously developed, meaning more hashrate, more data centers ...""      Besides reducing power costs, the company is looking to extend the lifespan of its equipment. By moving older equipment to Argentina, it can still be profitable because operation prices are only a fraction of those in Quebec. If left in Canada, the company would have to sell off the older equipment.      “We are not currently in a logic of wanting to attract players in the market,"" Quebec’s spokesperson said.      The region generates a huge surplus of energy that it exports to the U.S. Last year, Quebec exported more power to the U.S. than any other Canadian province.      But for Bitfarms, the future is elsewhere in the world. “There’s only so many rivers that you can dam up,” Gagnon says.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/12/why-crypto-miners-are-expanding-beyond-quebec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa202f3b5dff6bf28a759b8f32e6585944994c39-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was holding above price support at $32,000, with $36,400 seen as the upside target. For the past seven weeks bitcoin has mostly stayed in a range between $30,000 and $40,000.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $32779.6, -3.23%  Ether (ETH) $2014.93, -5.4%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4384.6, +0.34%  Gold: $1806.2, -0.25%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.369%, compared with 1.36% on Friday    ""It is starting to feel like the calm before the storm as muted and quiet activity appears across spot, derivative and on-chain metrics,” the blockchain analysis firm Glassnode wrote Monday in a report.    U.S. CPI report for June could rekindle inflation fears    Many cryptocurrency investors see bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, so the release Tuesday of the June consumer price index reading by the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics should provide a key data point.      The prior month’s report showed a 5% jump in the all-items index, the fastest since 2008, driven by higher prices for used cars and trucks.      On average, analysts expect a 4.9% reading for June, but any acceleration might rekindle speculation the Federal Reserve might need to slow its efforts to stimulate the economy. The U.S. central bank has nearly doubled the size of its balance sheet since early 2020 to more than $8 trillion, and the money-printing is seen as a catalyst for bitcoin’s price gains since then.      “The benchmark crypto has a solid price foundation, considering it’s unlikely we’ll see a reversal in the race to debase,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone wrote Monday in a report. “When measuring the value of an individual currency, the dollar, for example, may be strengthening or weakening versus a basket of like legal tender. Yet, it's the entire fiat-currency market that's declining.”      There’s some speculation that faster inflation in areas where the economy is reheating, such as airfares and lodging, might spread to enduring categories like rents.      “As of yet, this has largely not happened, supporting the Fed’s narrative that such inflationary pressures are transitory,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a July 9 report.      Consumers are apparently starting to believe higher prices might be the new norm: A survey released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found consumers, on average, expect prices to rise 4.8% over the coming year, up from a 4% expectation a month earlier.      Of course, it goes without saying there are a lot of different ways to measure rising consumer prices, and the CPI might not provide the truest picture.    Crypto markets meet Wall Street summer    It’s summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and that might be one explanation for why cryptocurrency markets have been so listless of late.      Glassnode described the bitcoin market as “impressively quiet.”      Trading volumes in the largest cryptocurrency have trended downward, and the digital-asset firm Eqonex speculates it might be, at least in part, because Wall Streeters who have recently nosed into cryptocurrencies are, well, taking a break.      According to the firm’s daily newsletter Monday, “2020 and 2021 marked the arrival of financial institutions into the crypto space. We celebrated, we cheered. But we forgot one thing: The people who work at these giants of finance love a summer holiday.”      Last year’s coronavirus-related lockdowns might play a part. Now that vaccines are rolling out and more people are able to get out and about and travel, some traders might be jumping at the chance to get away – and making up for lost time.      “Bitcoin may trade 24/7/365, but traders do not,” Eqonex writes. “Especially those with lake houses.”    Bitcoin vs. stocks    Bitcoin’s sluggishness comes as U.S. stocks have again climbed to another all-time high. As 2021 pushes deeper into its second half, some analysts might start to evaluate their track records. Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, so naturally the question arises of whether the reward justifies the risk.      The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was led higher on Monday by financial and real-estate stocks, with banks including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs set to report quarterly earnings starting Tuesday.      “The biggest things on people’s minds right now are the start of earnings season and the economic releases on the inflation front,” Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, told Bloomberg News. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield advanced 0.01 percentage point to 1.37%.      At one point earlier this year bitcoin had doubled from its price at the end of 2020. But the cryptocurrency’s recent slide has shaved the year-to-date gain to 14%. Such a performance trails the 17% increase for the S&P 500.      Such track records are key because, despite frequent admonitions that past performance is not a guarantor of future success, many investors allocate money to assets whose prices have been rising recently. Fear of missing out was a powerful driver for bitcoin in 2020, but at the moment it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot to worry about.    Capital outflow in digital asset investment funds    Digital asset investment funds saw a $4 million net capital outflow for the week ended July 9, reversing a net capital inflow of $63 million for the prior week. Trading volume in bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, dropped to $1.58 billion, the lowest since October 2020.      For the week ended July 9, bitcoin-focused funds recorded a $7 million capital outflow, according to a report by digital asset manager CoinShares. The cryptocurrency’s price has been consolidating in a narrow range of $32,000 to $35,000.      For recent weeks, North American funds dedicated to bitcoin have seen constant capital inflows while their European counterparts kept seeing outflows, which indicates “a geographic divergence in sentiment at present,” according to CoinShares.      Last week, Ethererum, Binance and Cardano saw minor inflows, while the largest inflows went into multi-asset investment funds with $1.2 million.    Altcoin Roundup  SNX surge: The price of SNX, the native token of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Synthetix, reached one-month highs above $13 early today. The DeFi token has gained 75% this month, while bitcoin is down 2%. SNX allows market participants to trade Ethereum-based synthetic contracts linked to traditional financial assets, including crude oil as well as stocks like Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Google, and Coinbase. SNX’s move to four-week highs comes as the protocol readies to launch its long-awaited exchange powered by Optimistic Ethereum, an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution aimed at boosting transaction throughput and bringing down fees.  Power Ledger’s Migration: Australia-based blockchain company Power Ledger is to migrate to Solana from Ethereum in search of higher speed and scalability. The firm also cited the lower energy output of Solana's Proof-of-History (POH) and Proof-of-Stake (POS) mechanisms in an announcement Monday.  Polygon Supports Esports Tournaments: Polygon is spending $10,000 to gin up excitement on esports platform Community Gaming. The partnership will kick off with a Polygon-sponsored summer tournament series. Players of SkyWeaver, a free-to-play non-fungible token (NFT) trading card game by Horizon Blockchain Games, will compete for $2,500 in MATIC tokens.

42406908,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8VAz,1626116167,The Bear Case for Bullish Is Spelled E-O-S,"There was a wave of what I’ll call bemusement in crypto circles last Friday when blockchain firm Block.One and investors including Peter Thiel announced they would take the cryptocurrency exchange Bullish public. The listing would take place via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), or a merger with a listed company, at a valuation of $9 billion. There are a number of uncertainties swirling around the plan, not least because the exchange doesn’t exist yet.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    In fact, Bullish was nearly invisible until May of this year, when Block.One announced that it was committing bitcoin and EOS tokens, then worth nearly $10 billion, to create a large liquidity pool for the exchange. The exchange itself is expected to launch later this year – when it will go up against a half-dozen far more established players in the U.S. exchange market, even as exchange activity trends downward as a bear market sets in.      All that is reason enough to question the wisdom of Bullish as an investment. But the real eyebrow-raiser for my money is the involvement of Block.One and its downtrodden smart-contracts platform EOS. Given years of consistently disappointing results from the company and affiliated projects, and a strange push to use EOS in the operation of the otherwise fully centralized Bullish, many crypto longtimers immediately wondered whether building a profitable crypto exchange is the only motive for the SPAC.    The brief, tragic history of Block.One and EOS    Block.One was founded in 2016 as a launchpad for EOS, a would-be “Ethereum killer” that raised a record $4.1 billion via an initial coin offering in the first half of 2018. Like many ICOs, that raise was later deemed an unregistered security offering by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Block.One paid a $24 million fine in 2019 – seen by many at the time as a comically paltry slap on the wrist relative to the amount raised.      Despite its massive war chest, EOS has failed to become even a remotely credible competitor to Ethereum, largely thanks to a failure to address deep design flaws. EOS was conceived by Dan Larimer, a co-founder of Block.One along with CEO Brendan Blumer, using a “delegated proof-of-stake” design that Larimer touted as the next generation of blockchain tech. But that didn’t really pan out: Within months of EOS’ launch, it became clear the voting process for selecting validator nodes was being aggressively gamed by cartels looking to capture block rewards.      That led to a “brain drain” as engaged, grassroots node operators were effectively pushed off the network. The problems also turned off developers: EOS currently hosts only one of the top 25 distributed applications (dapps), according to DappRadar. No EOS dapp has daily volume over $100,000, while Ethereum has at least 25 dapps with daily volume over $1 million. The Binance Smart Chain, Tron and Polygon systems have all attracted more activity than EOS, even though BSC and Polygon launched more recently.      Larimer joined that brain drain in January when he announced his departure from Block.One and EOS to work on “personal projects.” That continued a trend for Larimer, a once-prominent cryptocurrency leader who over time gained a reputation for moving on swiftly from projects he founded. That’s what happened at both BitShares, Larimer’s first big project, and Steem, a decentralized media project. BitShares is now essentially dormant, and Steem has struggled after Larimer’s departure.      Those missteps and failures led to abjectly awful bull market performance by the EOS token, which sank by more than 30% over the past 12 months in BTC terms. Since its peak in May 2018, the token is down nearly 95% versus BTC. Formerly a top 10 token, EOS has sunk to rank 27 by market cap, according to CoinGecko. EOS, remember, is Block.One’s reason for existing.    Block.One, Rewarded    Block.One said in May that the exchange would use “EOSIO and the EOS Public Blockchain to produce a cryptographically validated, provable, and immutable audit trail of all transactions processed on the Bullish platform.”      This has led to some confusion that Bullish will be a decentralized exchange, or DEX – a category that has seen explosive growth over the last year. But Bullish would be just as centralized as Coinbase, with the slight addition of writing receipts to EOS. That could have some transparency benefits, but doesn’t make the exchange meaningfully decentralized.      But the architecture does hint at a possible secondary motivation behind Bullish: Whether it turns out to be a successful exchange or not, Bullish’s use of EOS for recordkeeping will make EOS seem more successful, or at least promising, by creating on-chain transaction volume as well as fees and other revenue. Block.One currently holds just under 6% of all EOS, worth roughly $250 million, according to EOS Authority.      (Transaction costs on EOS are quite a tangle. Some transactions are nominally free, but costs are arguably just moved around into staking requirements and RAM fees for onboarding dapp users. Last year Block.One introduced a pay-as-you-go fee option.)      Those fees and costs would ultimately be paid by Bullish users – to the benefit of Block.one. In other words, Block.One is creating a spin-off that will in essence be its own long-term customer, for a service of unclear utility.    The MicroStrategy Theory    Another compelling angle on Bullish came Friday from Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX co-founder, who in a Twitter thread focused on the $6 billion in crypto reserves that Block.One and other investors have injected into Bullish. Those reserves amount to about two-thirds of the proposed value of the Bullish SPAC.      That led SBF to speculate that, rather than a competitor to Coinbase or Bakkt, “Maybe Bullish is really another MicroStrategy.” In other words, maybe the real investment here is not in any innovation Block.One and Peter Thiel might bring to crypto exchanges, but in Bullish’s crypto reserves. The public listing will, like MicroStrategy stock, be investable by some entities that can’t directly buy crypto, such as (in theory) institutions. As the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has shown , some investors are willing to pay a premium for these crypto-equity workarounds, though the near 50% markup on Bullish’s holdings might be a bit steep. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)      Another key distinction is that while MicroStrategy has been laser-focused on bitcoin, the reserves behind Bullish will be much more of a mixed bag. The $10 billion supplied by Block.One to stand up Bullish in May (which has since declined in value) was over 90% bitcoin, but also included 20 million EOS tokens, or about 2.5% of the total. (It’s unclear whether these funds have already been moved from Block.One’s EOS wallets). As an exchange, Bullish would also wind up holding an assortment of other coins.      So, hey, maybe there’s really demand for a public stock that’s like MicroStrategy but with a jumble of altcoins on top of a barrel of bitcoin! It certainly seems more likely than there being huge demand for yet another centralized exchange.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,David Z.

42406921,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8VJq,1626115832,Condo Management Meets Decentralized Governance,"On June 24, 2021, the Champlain Towers South condo in Florida collapsed, exposing a catastrophic fault line in the way condos are managed. Once the dust had settled and engineering reports determined the material cause of the fatal disaster, news agencies like the New York Times began investigating how the building fell into such disrepair. It discovered a history of mismanagement, including condo board infighting, inexperienced management, deferred maintenance, lax and ineffective safety audits as well as inadequate savings for repairs. Since then, many other condos have been identified as being at risk.    Quinn DuPont is an assistant professor in the UCD Lochlann Quinn School of Business at University College Dublin.    These condos face a classic collective action problem. Many condo boards are unable to find consensus, lack financial and managerial transparency and make poor decisions. While these are hard problems to solve, blockchain governance technologies might offer solutions. Could blockchain prevent future condo collapses?      There are at least three opportunities for blockchain technologies to support the rapidly growing, multi-billion dollar property management software industry: polycentric governance, enhanced voting and secure asset management.    Blockchain for condo governance    Long before the collapse of Champlain Towers South, residents faced a $15 million bill for repairs, but the condo board only had $800,000 in savings. Across the U.S., up to one-third of condos have inadequate savings for essential repairs, in many cases due to inexperienced condo board management (often run by volunteer homeowners) who are unable to come to agreement. Condo boards often struggle to achieve consensus because trust has been compromised and there are few incentives to collaborate. The situation is similar to other collective action problems, like the allocation of fishing, forestry and water rights.      In her Nobel prize winning research, American economist Elinor Ostrom studied “polycentric governance” and discovered there are powerful strategies for governance that avoid the pitfalls of both simple markets and centralized government policies. She found:    a) Decisions made by small, independent organizations are more effective than large, centralized ones  b) Competitive and exclusive property rights are traditional but by no means the only form of ownership (collective, non-rivalrous “toll” use of goods is possible)  c) An evolving set of “rules in use” can support common understanding and agreement and  d) Complex systems can be modeled as game environments with rules for optimal behavior     To test her analysis, Ostrom worked with Roy Gardner and James Walker to develop an economic model with a quadratic payoff function that required participants to allocate tokens between markets. In one experiment, participants had to make decisions using only aggregated information, which led to substantial over-investment. But in a second experiment, where participants could directly communicate with each other, their joint returns were improved. The lesson for condo governance is that if decentralized communication and trust were woven into the fabric of a condo board, consensus may emerge naturally.      You would be forgiven if all this discussion of tokens, markets, games, rules and decentralized decision making sounds suspiciously like the crypto platforms with which readers of CoinDesk are familiar. Indeed, these are precisely the tools being used for next-gen blockchain governance, including decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and the ongoing re-imagination of property with non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      Achieving optimal consensus and engendering – not eliminating – trust will help condo boards agree on decisions, but blockchain can also help make better decisions. Condo boards are usually democratic but when faced with thorny collective action problems simple voting schemes like one person-one vote tend to collapse into mob rule.      Enhanced voting schemes like auctions and delegated or quadratic voting are being actively tested on decentralized blockchains. Auctions are highly efficient for incentivizing predictable behaviors; delegated voting schemes like “liquid democracy” combine the benefits of direct democracy with expert-led decision making; and quadratic voting balances majority-minority interests by making strongly held opinions “expensive.”    Read more: The Changemaker: Glen Weyl Puts His Radical Ideas Into Action    Due to the complexities of tabulating results from these decentralized decision making systems, trusted computation platforms (like blockchain) are needed. So it seems reasonable to think that condo boards at loggerheads could use blockchain platforms to make intelligent, timely decisions. Therefore, right-sized solutions to decision making should focus on supporting condo boards, not government-mandated policies.      Finally, since procurement and bid selection for condo repairs requires huge sums of money to be collectively held and managed, secure and transparent crypto assets are an obvious solution. Savings accounts for condo boards are managed across long time horizons by changing (and untrusted) treasurers that require sustained, collective investment.      While future property management software designed like a decentralized autonomous organization may lack the excitement of boom and bust crypto, it may offer sustainable financial management and a measure of safety.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Quinn DuPont,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/12/condo-management-meets-decentralized-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27deba545588066621797dbe535c9350ccc33cb5-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406917,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8VHs,1626108883,"We Should Sign On to the Web, Not to Websites","I recently moved. This means I've needed to go into a bunch of different accounts and update my physical address. This has involved a lot of bouncing around in my password manager and the odd reset for accounts I hadn't properly logged.      It's aggravating, but I'm pretty good at this. Members of my family have an existential crisis each time they are threatened with needing to keep track of one more password. And if it were possible to know how much time we've all spent logging into websites, it would surely shock each one of us to the core.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The next version of the web needs to have a single sign-on (SSO). The vision should be that you sign into the web itself rather than each website. Imagine: You fire up your browser, do one sign-on and then you're good to go on every website you visit. If you visit a new site, you just give it permission to use the identity you have running already.      How much time would that save?      ""I think blockchain SSO is the future of identity management for the internet. We have this situation where cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has encouraged everyone to get a private public key pair,"" Matthew Gould, the CEO of Unstoppable Domains, which makes crypto-powered web addresses, said in a phone call. ""I think it's a huge opportunity.""      SSO is at the heart of the vision for Web 3.0, putting identity back into the hands of users rather than the centralized services.    Re-orienting identity    Anyone who is a decentralized finance (DeFi) user is already familiar with the concept. You have your MetaMask wallet running in your browser. You can use that to access any of the various DeFi apps. A click or two of verification with your active wallet is all it takes to get inside.      And it's important to think about what's happening here. That website is looking at public data about your wallet that's kept on the Ethereum blockchain. That's data that you generate and you can see as easily as that app can. This is a completely different framework from the web as we know it.      On Web 2.0, the sign-on is controlled by the website and as soon as you start using it you're generating data in their servers, not your own. You can't edit it. You can't copy it. You can't even see it.    Read more: Self-Sovereign Identity Explained    ""Data portability is an important thing for people to understand, being able to bring your own data to an app,"" Gould said. Case in point: I've used a lot of music apps over the years and wish there were some way I could aggregate all my favorites from each app.      Unfortunately, each time I join a new one I start from zero once again. No doubt I've lost track of dozens of bands I've liked this way.    You own you    There's another upshot of this: In an SSO future, it's harder to kick people off websites. Even if a website does blacklist an identity, it can't take that identity away.      ""It's fundamentally irrevocable and in many ways unblockable,"" Mark Hendrickson, product lead at the developer of a Bitcoin-based decentralized internet, Hiro Systems, wrote in an email. If a pseudonymous Twitter user is known by a handle on Twitter that gets booted, the user is just gone forever. There's no way to really prove you are you on another site. Not so if Twitter were using an external identity; Twitter could boot the user but he or she could still prove who they were on another site.      ""The user is given complete, independent control over their credentials that work over a wide range of sites and apps, as well as control over their public identity as they decide to layer onto those credentials,"" Hendrickson said.      Hiro is the new name of the company previously known as Blockstack, which garnered a patent for its SSO product last year.    Inventions    Of course, there are SSO standards on the web right now. The classic is OAuth, but more and more Google, Facebook and (recently) Apple want to be the chief way to sign into websites. Not only does this give those giants more visibility into your online activities, but it allows them to control what can and can't be built.      A blockchain SSO world cuts out the third parties. ""The key difference with this system over a traditional OAuth solution is we move from a three-party system to a two-party system in terms of privacy and tracking of data,"" Vinny Lingham, the founder of decentralized identity startup Civic, wrote in an email.    Read more: Torus Launches to Bring One-Click Login to Web 3.0    Gould predicts an open-source core at the heart of a few different decentralized SSO standards, and then lots of startups will build applications on top of that core. These applications might do interesting things, like enabling users to prove what age they are or where they live or the fact that they are elite players of Fortnite.      When identity is built in the open, works across the whole internet and no one can stop anyone from building on it, entrepreneurs are likely to get very creative.

42406913,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8VCx,1626090335,Bitcoin Listless as New 'Bearish Crossover' Looms,"Bitcoin continues to be in a lull, with its price locked in a narrow range of $32,000 to $35,000 for more than two weeks. Due to prolonged consolidation, popular indicators like the relative strength index are no longer suggesting directional bias.      However, a chart analysis of long-term moving price averages suggests more bearishness ahead. The cryptocurrency's 100-day simple moving average (SMA) is about to cross below the 200-day SMA for the first time since May 2020.      The so-called bearish crossover comes weeks after the 50- and 200-day SMAs charted the ""death cross."" Bearish crossovers of longer duration averages often lag price action and trap traders on the wrong side of the market.      For instance, bitcoin barely saw any bearish moves following the previous bear cross of 100- and 200-day SMAs in May 2020. A similar bear cross was observed in April 2018, October 2014 and April 2014, coinciding with interim price bottoms. The one observed in November 2019 was followed by a deeper price decline.      That said, the absence of solid follow-through to the repeated defense of the $30,000 support in the past few weeks is a cause for concern.      According to Katie Stockton, founder, and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, a move above the 50-day SMA resistance at $35,621 may bring more buyers, lifting prices above $40,000.      The immediate support is seen at $32,100 (July 8 low) followed by $30,000.

42406882,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8TkR,1626089400,"Which Crypto Firms Will Follow Coinbase, Circle Into the Public Markets?","Crypto firms – some as young as a couple of months old – are turning to the public markets for liquidity. At this stage, it’s anyone’s guess as to which company will announce its intention to list next.      The number of announcements has accelerated after the largest U.S. exchange, Coinbase, went public via a direct listing in April.      Crypto lender BlockFi, cross-border payments network Ripple and crypto exchange Kraken are all considering going public.      Crypto exchange Apifiny, bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt, lending fintech SoFi and cryptocurrency trading platform eToro have set plans to go public.      And stablecoin issuer Circle and Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish both have special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deals in motion.      So who’s next?    Exchanges    The most likely suspects for a new public listing are crypto exchanges that could compete against Coinbase – Gemini, Blockchain.com and FTX, said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau.      Fees on exchanges are still very high and crypto exchanges have yet to experience a race to zero, and every company in the crypto space relies on exchanges for crypto price data.      “The heart of the capital markets system is the exchange,” Lau said.      Going public allows early investors in a company to cash out. It also gives firms the validation of publicly available financials, allows them to issue additional shares to acquire other firms and offers them a global boost to their brands, Lau added.    Compliance    Other firms that would be in a position to go public would be those that can serve clients outside just the crypto space, like blockchain sleuthing firm Chainalysis and digital securities firm Securitize, Lau added.    Read more: Crypto Sleuthing Firm Chainalysis Raises $100M, This Time at $4.2B Valuation    ""Those are the dark horses I would think about,"" Lau said.    Mining    The other crypto vertical that may see more public exits is crypto mining, said Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev.      Following in the footsteps of Riot Blockchain, Hive Blockchain and Marathon Patent Group, these public offerings would include mining firms that are based in the U.S. and see an opportunity to pick up the slack following China’s crypto mining ban or allay environmental concerns.    Read more: Stronghold Digital Mining Raises $105M to Turn Waste Coal Into Bitcoin    “It’s almost better to do it when bitcoin's at $30,000 rather than when it was $60,000 because you get the 50-50 chance of it going up versus down,” Dolev said. “Because stocks are trading on what’s going to happen and not what happened in the past.”    Custody    Crypto security firms that offer custody and multi-party computation (MPC) are another key piece of infrastructure that may be looking to be acquired by larger companies (such as PayPal’s purchase of Curv) or go public via a SPAC, Dolev said.      “Option one for a lot of these companies that need to [exit] and can’t find a good enough price will be the SPAC route,” Dolev said.    Y tho?    The odd part of the recent spate of announcements is that there has been no shortage of capital for crypto startups to tap into in the private markets, said Lisa Ellis, an analyst for the brokerage firm MoffettNathanson.      Going public through a SPAC as a young crypto company raises additional questions because being acquired by a shell company doesn’t require these firms to file a proper S-1.

An OKLink representative told CoinDesk the partnership aims to tackle money laundering, not everyday policing.

42406895,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8TuH,1626089264,Synthetix Rallies as DeFi Protocol Announces Layer 2 Launch,"While bitcoin, the crypto market leader, remains in a deep slumber, some coins continue to see news-driven price moves. One such coin is SNX, the native token of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Synthetix, which allows market participants to trade Ethereum-based synthetic contracts linked to traditional financial assets, including crude oil as well as stocks like Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Google, and Coinbase.      Per Messari data, SNX reached one-month highs above $13 early today and was last seen changing hands near $12.90, up 17% on a 24-hour basis. The DeFi token has gained 75% this month, while bitcoin is down 2%.      SNX's move to four-week highs comes as the protocol readies to launch its long-awaited exchange powered by Optimistic Ethereum, an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution aimed at boosting transaction throughput and bringing down fees.      SNX holders can lock their SNX as collateral to stake the system. Synths are minted against the value of the locked SNX.      ""SNX's upside is in part supported by the latest update from the team in relation to the planned collaboration with Optimism,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Synthetix founder Kain Warwick published a blog post over the weekend, announcing the launch in the week beginning July 26 and calling it one of the most important milestones in the project's history. ""We announced the upcoming launch of Synth trading on L2 (Optimism) which could be a catalyst for significant trading volume growth by the end of this month,"" Jordan Momtazi, Synthetix's core contributor, told CoinDesk.      The new layer 2 exchange will initially support synthetic ether (sETH), synthetic bitcoin (sBTC), and synthetic link (sLINK) and will add more assets, with natural shorts on all Synths, according to the official blog post.      Aside from the layer 2 launch, the impending Thales token airdrop to SNX stakers seems to have fueled the recent price rise.      ""SNX's recent surge is also inspired by the launch of binary options platform Thales, where Synthetix was a seed investor, which came with a sweetener deal for SNX stakers who will get 35% of all Thales tokens,"" Vinokourov added.      The binary options platform Thales secured seed funding from Synthetix in May. As a part of the deal, Thales agreed to distribute 35% of the 100 million Thales token supply to SNX stakers (not holders).      ""35% of tokens will be claimable by SNX stakers with minted debt. An SNX staker's pro-rata share of the global synth debt pool will be the primary scaling factor used for calculating how many of the 35,000,000 Thales tokens a Spartan may be able to claim,"" Synthetix's blog post dated May 20 said. ""15,000,000 are slated for retroactive distribution with linear unlocking, and 20,000,000 will be claimable weekly over 12 months.""      Momtazi said that Thales airdrop will likely happen in August-September, but the distribution will have a ""retrospective and forward-looking portion"" which will reward previous, current, and future SNX stakers.      While SNX is trading higher at press time, bitcoin is trading 1% lower on the day near $33,800. The cryptocurrency remains coiled in the broad range of $30,000 to $40,000.

DeFi has been touted as possessing the ability to usurp financial middlemen through its use of smart contracts to execute code that govern the rules between two counterparties once specific measures, such as time, have been met.    Read more: What Is DeFi?    One way the bank was looking to prepare itself, said Panich, was by investing in DeFi ""very actively"" in order to learn. The bank is also looking to find suitable partners in the sector as well as integrating DeFi into traditional finance.      ""We would like to partner with DeFi protocols to work together to solve the issues in traditional finance to reduce costs of operation, have real-time settlements, eliminate intermediaries as well as have a high level of transparency,"" said Panich.      To that end, the chief investment officer said she believed in a future where traditional financial companies work hand in hand with decentralized ones pointing to traditional's ""huge customer base.""      In that scenario, traditional financial companies would pick up the slack on customer-facing activities such as acquiring customers, providing them with a ""simple, easy to understand, and integrated interface."" DeFi, in turn, would power the back end to reduce transaction and settlement times, lower costs and increase transparency.      ""For this to happen, I think traditional financial companies like us should actively explore, invest and adopt DeFi. And at the same time, DeFi companies should look to work with traditional financial companies to leverage their strengths,"" said Panich.      ""This is why we have invited industry leaders to educate the South East Asia region about new innovations in DeFi and look forward to hearing from them at our second annual REDeFiNE TOMORROW Summit on July 22-23.""    Further development    When asked what trends SCB was seeing in the sector, Panich told CoinDesk she was looking to the promise of continuing development in the infrastructure and cross-chain interoperability among existing protocols.      ""Currently, different blockchains are solving specific problems within their own ecosystem,"" said Panich. ""There are a lot of inefficiencies as assets are being used mostly within the ecosystem and cannot be transferred to be used in another blockchain that easily.""      DeFi has often faced difficulties in getting different protocols to speak to one another as a result of different programming languages and varying consensus rules used. Solving those issues would allow for a more efficient use of assets and information across various blockchains, Panich said.

""Investing in the picks and shovels is always a good idea,"" said Panich. ""DeFi applications have been innovating really fast in the last year, and now the infrastructure needs to be upgraded in order to catch up with all these innovations.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TRADING | ZRX,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/12/venture-arm-of-thailands-oldest-bank-says-defi-will-disrupt-traditional-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52b672d16bb648690eda51430ed65bf1363c86e2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report Sunday by the Australian Financial Review, the company is in discussions with cryptocurrency exchanges in a bid to add functionality for trading the nascent asset class.      Around A$5.9 billion (US$4.4 billion) in the total value of securities is currently held on the SelfWealth platform.      The company plans to add up to 10 cryptos on its platform, including bitcoin and ether, by year's end that will be held in an integrated third-party wallet. SelfWealth will also look to charge a flat percentage fee for every crypto trade it conducts on behalf of clients as is the case amongst its traditional equities trades.      Over two-thirds of its customer base, comprising of traders and investors, hold or plan to invest in digital assets, per the report, signifying an increase in demand among the country's traditional investors.

42406880,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8TgV,1626055404,El Salvador Could Face 'Limitation' on Bitcoin's Use as Medium of Exchange: JPMorgan,"Global investment bank JPMorgan says bitcoin's use in El Salvador's economy faces headwinds, suggesting a potential ""limitation"" on its use case as a medium of exchange may emerge.      In a report by the bank on Thursday and reported by Bloomberg Sunday, JPMorgan said problems could arise due to the fact that much bitcoin is tied up in illiquid entities, 90% of which hasn't changed hands in over a year.      The bank points to daily payment activity in the country, which would represent around 4% of recent on-chain transaction volume and over 1% of the total value of tokens that have transferred between wallets in 12 months.      This represents ""potentially a significant limitation on its potential as a medium of exchange,"" JPMorgan said.      El Salvador's legislature voted and passed its Bitcoin Law on June 8 that will see the country formally adopting the crypto as legal tender on Sept. 7.      Some critics are questioning the move by the country's President Nayib Bukele, who initiated the bill, while others argue it violates their constitutional rights.      JPMorgan also outlined a recent survey showing a majority of Salvadorans viewed the new law as ""not at all correct"" with a further 46% of those polled saying they had no idea what bitcoin was.    Read more: El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law Effective September, E-Wallets to Get $30 Worth of Crypto    And while that may cause complications, JPMorgan said that aside from the illiquid nature of the asset, the biggest concerns facing bitcoin's adoption into the country's economy lay in its volatility and imbalance of demand for bitcoin to U.S. dollars.
