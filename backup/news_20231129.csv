42409298,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGIkV,1701302085,Celo Developer Proposes Mid-January Timeline for Evaluating Closely Watched Layer-2 Move,"The Celo blockchain's primary developer laid out a ""framework"" for choosing a technology provider for its new layer-2 network atop Ethereum, proposing to wrap up the evaluation by mid-January in what has become a surprisingly intense competition between some of the blockchain industry's most prominent teams.  The developer, cLabs, published the ""Framework for selecting an L2 stack"" Wednesday on its discussion forum, inviting community feedback on the document by mid-December, and plans to assess the various suitors over the ensuing month.  The community behind Celo approved the plan to transition to a layer-2 blockchain in July, essentially an acknowledgment that the project was more likely to thrive as a part of the dominant and fast-growing Ethereum ecosystem than remaining as a lesser, standalone network.  Initially, CLabs had named OP Stack from the Optimism ecosystem – the technology underpinning the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase's new layer-2 network, Base – as the default provider for its new layer-2 network. But over the following several months, rival teams Polygon and then Matter Labs, which stands behind the zkSync project, offered competing proposals aiming to woo Celo's business.  Celo ranks as the 27th-biggest blockchain in decentralized finance, with a total value locked, or TVL, of $102 million, according to the website DeFiLlama. That's a tiny fraction of the $26.2 billion in the Ethereum ecosystem, and still well behind Solana's $656 million.  But because the teams are at pains to establish dominant layer-2 ecosystems – with first-mover benefits at stake such as the wherewithal to set industry standards and aggregate liquidity – Celo's choice has evolved into a surprisingly competitive proxy battle.  ""Note that we are selecting codebases and sub-components here, so we feel it is less useful to directly compare metrics like TVL, transaction count, users, except as indicators of what a closer collaboration and/or shared bridge between the two ecosystems could look like in future,"" cLabs wrote. ""This exercise is not to select a 'best L2 stack.' It's to figure out which is the best fit for the specific technical and non-technical needs of the Celo L2 project.""  Priorities laid out in the new CLabs proposed framework include ""simple migration, with minimal downtime,"" preserving low gas fees and Ethereum compatibility.  The document makes no mention of the ongoing debate between optimistic rollups versus ZK rollups, a key design choice that experts say brings important tradeoffs between operating cost and speed.  What's clear is the desire of the cLabs team to get on with it – perhaps a nod to how fast the blockchain landscape is evolving.  ""Our objective is to deliver CEL2 as soon as possible, minimizing implementation risk,"" according to the proposal. ""We favor projects that have been audited and deployed and proven in production, vs. projects whose designs are subject to ongoing change or whose implementations are not yet proven.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/29/celo-developer-proposes-mid-january-timeline-for-evaluating-closely-watched-layer-2-move,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f1a228104d2c5a50f12509cd7748e9cddf4363a-768x432.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20862318,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562981,1701298839,XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Identifies 3 Key Factors That Will Trigger Parabolic Move,"The XRP price keeps being projected to enjoy a massive rally soon enough. Many have continued to speculate when this might happen. A crypto analyst has some answers, as he has highlighted three key indicators that could trigger this rally. Three Determinants For A “Parabolic Move” In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto analyst JD noted that XRP’s monthly was coming. He went on to state three things that “need” to happen if XRP is to see a massive rally. The first factor he highlighted was the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI). He stated that there has to be a bullish cross on the SRSI. Related Reading: MasterCard Coming To XRP? Prominent Developer Teases Major Upgrade The SRSI is a technical indicator that is generally used to forecast market trends. It measures the strengths and weaknesses of the relative strength indicator (RSI). It is from this RSI it also derives its value from. Source: X Still emphasizing the SRSI, JD stated that the second factor is that both SRSI lines must cross above 80. This level refers to an overbought condition in the XRP market. As such, it is unclear why JD considers it bullish, considering that traders usually see an overbought condition as a sell signal with an impending correction in mind. XRP Price To Breakout In 2025 For the third factor, JD alluded to an 8-year trendline break. In the accompanying chart that he shared, one could see that he was projecting XRP to break out in 2025 following 8 years of consolidation. In the chart, he also highlighted how XRP broke out in 2017 after a 4-year consolidation. Some analysts seem to be betting on XRP, enjoying a similar rally to the one that happened back in 2017. The crypto token is known to have seen a 61,000% gain in 280 days and crypto analyst CryptoInsightUK recently shared his thoughts on that happening. Without directly stating if a repeat could happen, he outlined several factors that put XRP in a better position than then. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Pour $346 Million Into Crypto – Here Are The Winners Another crypto analyst who has referred to the 2017 period in his projection is Egrag Crypto. He recently mentioned that $27 is a “plausible target” for XRP’s price with the 2017 surge in mind. He didn’t, however, mention when exactly XRP could attain such heights. More recently, Egrag stated that XRP is on the “brink of a bullish cross.” Many analysts continue to give their opinion on what price level XRP could hit, with some stating that XRP could rise to as high as $10,000. It remains to be seen how much of these bullish projections will be actualized. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.61, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The court also expanded crypto investment firm Galaxy's mandate to assist FTX in the sales of its trust assets, according to a Tuesday court filing. FTX tapped Galaxy earlier this year to manage the estate's vast digital asset holdings.

20860551,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563092,1701295224,Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Bloomberg Analyst Reiterates 90% Chance Of January ETF Approval,"Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, is currently in an upward accumulation phase, inching closer to surpassing its current yearly high of $38,390. This upward trend is further fueled by the anticipation surrounding the approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin ETF Approval By January 10 In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Erich Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF expert, shared his perspective on the probability of Bitcoin ETF approval. Balchunas maintains a 90% chance of SEC approval by January 10, which has remained consistent for months. Related Reading: A Golden Opportunity For Ethereum? 600% Buy Signal Returns Balchunas highlights that while debates over specific dates and timelines persist, the SEC and issuers are diligently working behind the scenes to make ETFs ready for this cycle, defying earlier skepticism. Balchunas stated: People asking me if we changed odds. No, we still holding line at 90% odds of approval by Jan 10 (aka this cycle), the same odds we’ve had for months (before it was cool/safe). What we watching for now: more amended/final filings to roll in and clarity on in-kind vs cash creates As predicted by many analysts, Bitcoin is poised for a potential breakout in the upcoming months, both before and after these investment products’ anticipated approval. As reported by NewsBTC, Bitcoin could surge to as high as $50,000 even before the halving event forecasted for April. In this context, Bitcoin must maintain its position above the key support level of $35,000. This mark serves as a threshold for future gains, both preceding and succeeding the approval of spot ETFs. Upholding this support level will be instrumental in determining Bitcoin’s prospects for continued growth and market performance. Next Resistance Level Holds Key To Surpassing All-Time High Renowned crypto analyst Crypto Con has shed light on the remarkable strength of the current Bitcoin cycle, drawing comparisons to the previous from 2019 to 2022. By examining key resistance levels and price movements, Crypto Con emphasizes the positive outlook for Bitcoin’s price trajectory and suggests that the current cycle is poised for success. Crypto Con highlights the prolonged weakness observed during the 2019-2022 Bitcoin cycle, characterized by Bitcoin’s struggle to surpass the initial Wave Trend resistance over a year. Related Reading: XRP Community And Cardano Founder Engage In Heated Clash In contrast, the current cycle has demonstrated impressive resilience, effortlessly breaking through this resistance level. Despite the substantial rise in Bitcoin’s price, Crypto Con points out that the cryptocurrency has yet to reach the next resistance level, called green zone 2, with a price target of $40,000. In a typical cycle, this milestone does not indicate the end of price action but rather marks the beginning of a more significant upward trajectory. Crypto Con further suggests that subsequent resistance levels, indicated by the color blue in the chart above, can drive Bitcoin’s price even higher, surpassing its previous all-time high. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $37,700, down 0.7% over the past 24 hours, and it remains to be seen if a consolidation above $38,000 will occur.

The aim is to optimize GBTC’s structure for an anticipated uplisting to a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and level the playing field when it comes to other applicants such as asset management giant BlackRock.  The GBTC update, which will be put out for shareholder vote, involves two proposed modifications to the trust agreement.  The first allows fees – which had been collected by Grayscale on a monthly basis – to be payable daily. This is a structural tweak and not part of any type of fee reduction – something Grayscale has committed to, but which has not been finalized as of yet, a company spokeswoman said.  Grayscale currently charges a 2% management fee for GBTC; the typical range for firms awaiting approval for spot bitcoin ETFs is 0.7%-1%, according to an analyst report by Matrixport.  The second update allows assets to be commingled in an omnibus account manner, which will enable a more frictionless creation and redemption of shares – the core processing mechanism of the ETF. This is an innovation comprising part of Coinbase Custody’s service. The BlackRock iShares product, along with a number of other spot ETF applicants, will also employ Coinbase Custody.  Analysts expect the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely approve several spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in quick succession. This makes for a febrile atmosphere among applicants, especially since the winner in this race is expected to have a sizable first-mover advantage in hoovering up a large portion of everyday investors.  “Today, Grayscale has outlined proposed amendments to GBTC’s Trust Agreement that are intended to provide operational efficiencies that we believe are beneficial to both Grayscale and GBTC,"" a Grayscale spokeswoman said via email. ""Importantly, this is in our normal course of business, and GBTC remains ready to uplist as a spot Bitcoin ETF to NYSE Arca upon appropriate regulatory approvals.""  The amendments will come at no extra cost to Grayscale shareholders and neither are essential to make the conversion to an ETF, the filing said.

20858806,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562963,1701291629,The Other Side Of The Bitcoin: Analyst Highlights What Happens If Bulls Fail,"Bitcoin has currently entered a stage where the bulls and the bears are vying for absolute control over the price, meaning that it could swing either way. While sentiment is still mostly bullish from here, there is still the possibility that the bears could win out and this side of the coin has prompted crypto analyst FieryTrading to map out what could happen if this ends up being the case. Identifying The Bearish Side Of Bitcoin In the analysis, FieryTrading identified an indicator that might point toward a bearish reversal for Bitcoin and this was the Wyckoff distribution pattern. The analyst observes that the Bitcoin price might actually be current trading within this Wyckoff distribution pattern which would not be positive for the price. Related Reading: Analyst Uses 5200% Impulse Against Bitcoin To Predict XRP Price Surge To $9.6 “As seen on the chart, the BC/UT/UTAD are nearly identical as on the schematic. Three higher-highs, of which the first two are sold off quickly, and the last (UTAD) took a while before it turned bearish,” Fiery Trading explains. Furthermore, the analyst explains that the AR and SOW phases identified in the chart above are almost identical. However, there is a significant difference, which is that the Bitcoin price has already retested the AR-low between the UT and UTAD identified twice already. Source: TradingView.com In a scenario where this bearish setup plays out, the crypto analyst explains that there will end up being another retest around the SOW region in the future. If this happens and support fails to hold, allowing the price to fall through this SOW area, then I would be very bearish for the price. The target in such a scenario would be $30,000, effectively marking the $38,400 level as the local top. “This would also mean that 38.4k is the 2023 top, with a move towards 30.000$ being fairly likely,” FieryTrading posits. The analyst reiterates their own bullishness toward the price of Bitcoin. However, they also express that it is important to see bearish signs when they appear. “The fact that we had three higher highs which were all sold off is alarming at the very least.” BTC Begins To Slowdown The Bitcoin price has already seen a slowdown after an impressive run-up above $38,000, which explains why some indicators have begun to turn bearish. One example of this is the decline in the trading volume which suggests that investors are not as active in the coin now as they used to. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 4400% XRP Price Surge To $27, Here’s When The decline in trading volume has coincided with a drop in the market sentiment. However, the negative sentiment is still drowned out predominantly by the positive as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index still points to greed. This suggests that despite the decline in price and trading volume, investors are not selling off much of their holdings.

20857049,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563060,1701288011,"Whale’s Move: $19.5 Million XRP Shifted To Exchange, Massive Sell Off On The Horizon?","Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracker, reported a substantial transfer of XRP tokens to the Bithumb crypto exchange. This transfer, involving over 32 million XRP tokens valued at roughly $19.5 million, originated from an unidentified wallet and was executed today at 05:15:10 UTC. The substantial nature of this transaction places it firmly in the category of ‘whale transactions,’ which are often scrutinized due to their potential influence on market dynamics. In the crypto space, such significant transfers are typically indicative of strategic moves by influential players within the market. Related Reading: XRP Price Set For 20% Leap In Coming Days: Crypto Analyst While the specific intention behind this transaction remains undisclosed, and the whale’s identity is unknown, its occurrence has not led to any notable immediate price fluctuations in XRP, with only a marginal decrease of 0.1% observed so far. Massive Sell-Off On The Horizon? Historically, the transfer of substantial amounts of crypto to exchanges by whales has been linked with either an intent to liquidate or to swap for other digital assets. This makes such movements anticipated to result in a price drop following a significant sell-off. However, a technical analysis of the current situation suggests a different narrative for XRP. Looking at the asset’s chart on the 4-hour time frame, XRP has recently tapped into an order block on the sell side, which could signal an impending price reversal to the upside in trading parlance. Mainly, an order block in financial markets is essentially a zone where the initiation or absorption of a large volume of orders occurs. It is considered a crucial area on price charts, as traders often expect a reversal when the price taps into these zones. In essence, an order block represents a consolidation area where significant trading activities previously took place, and revisiting these zones can often lead to a shift in market momentum. So far, XRP has shown signs of reversal after tapping this orderblock. Particularly, the asset has moved from the price zone of $0.59, where the order block is located, and surged past $0.61 before showing a current retracement that brings its price to trade at $0.60. Bullish Forecasts for XRP Meanwhile, the XRP community has been witnessing a series of optimistic analyses from prominent crypto market analysts. Notably, Egrag, a renowned figure in the crypto analysis sphere, recently shared his insights on XRP, indicating a potential bullish reversal for the digital asset. #XRP Inverse Head & Shoulder Formation in progress (UPDATE): https://t.co/JRvvFEVhBv pic.twitter.com/wy90z4kCO4 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 29, 2023 His analysis identified an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern on XRP’s chart, a technical indicator often suggesting a trend change from bearish to bullish.

42409291,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGIdt,1701287858,U.S. Treasury Campaigning for Amplified Powers to Chase Crypto Overseas,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury has been pushing for lawmakers to grant it extended powers to battle illicit finance using crypto.  One of the government's requests is for special jurisdiction over non-U.S. stablecoin issuers, such as Tether.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury is pressing lawmakers for a new set of powers that would give the government unprecedented enforcement and sanctions authority over the crypto sector, including the ability to roam well beyond American borders and get involved with transactions that don't involve its citizenry.  Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo has lobbied senior members of Congress with a proposal – mapped out in writing – that he called ""a set of common-sense recommendations to expand our authorities and broaden our tools and resources to go after illicit actors in the digital asset space,"" according to excerpts from a speech he's set to deliver on Wednesday in Washington.  ""Modes of raising and moving money continue to evolve and many of our authorities have not been updated in decades,"" according to the Treasury document sent to lawmakers and obtained by CoinDesk. Terrorist groups – including Hamas – ""use new virtual methods to move, store and obfuscate their funding streams. These methods often include the use of evasive cryptocurrency networks and services, including mixers.""  Congress should grant the Treasury ""a new secondary sanctions tool"" against exchanges that support terrorism, according to the proposal. It could give the government similar powers when targeting virtual asset providers as its long had over correspondent banking accounts and ""would account for the technological changes that have rendered highly effective tools in the traditional payments context less effective against cryptocurrencies.""  Sanctions tool  Adeyemo said it ""will not only cut off a firm from the U.S. financial system, but will also expose any firm that continues to do business with the sanctioned entity to being cut off from the U.S. financial system.""  Lawmakers should also beef up the department's powers under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), allowing for the ""targeting of cryptocurrency entities and services that facilitate funding for terrorists,"" the proposal said. It calls for a new category of financial institutions under the BSA that would include ""cryptocurrency exchanges, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), virtual asset wallet providers, certain blockchain validator nodes and decentralized finance services,"" requiring them to meet certain anti-money-laundering demands.  As the crypto industry has repeatedly argued: Many of these entities, such as wallet providers and decentralized finance (DeFi) entities may not be in any practical position to meet those kinds of requirements, and a law could effectively snuff them out.  Austin Campbell, the founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting, noted on X that the proposal has some reasonable points but is also asking for ""the broadest expansions of powers since the Patriot Act, and in a way that makes a mockery of some of the technical details of modern communication with the side benefit of probably causing major geopolitical conflict due to the overreach.""  Tether  The government is also apparently looking for power over Tether, the issuer of the biggest stablecoin, USDT, and its ilk.  ""Legislation could explicitly authorize OFAC to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over transactions in stablecoins pegged to the USD (or other dollar-denominated transactions) as they generally would over USD transactions,"" the proposal suggested, giving a reach into transactions that the document notes ""involve no U.S. touchpoints.""  Adeyemo doubled down on that idea in his Wednesday remarks, saying that non-U.S. stablecoin issuers shouldn't be able to use the U.S. dollar without ""procedures to prevent terrorists from abusing their platform.""  This Treasury campaign cites reports on the crypto funding efforts from Hamas – made especially relevant in the context of that group's recent attacks on Israel – but the brief mention doesn't note that aspects of those reports had later been discredited by an analysis firm that was originally cited, leaving the extent of Hamas' crypto involvement uncertain.  Meanwhile, the Treasury Department is fresh off of an earth-shaking $4.3 billion settlement with Binance, which among fines to various agencies included the Treasury's largest-ever corporate penalty. The agreement saddled the biggest global exchange with monitors to report the company's ongoing behavior to U.S. government watchdogs. And also on Wednesday, the department announced its latest action against a crypto mixing service, Sinbad.  ""As terrorists and criminals innovate their approach to illicit finance, we need tools to be able to keep up with them,"" Adeyemo said.

His SEC predecessor, Jay Clayton, had seemed largely disinterested in digital assets, whereas Gensler had taught courses on blockchain at MIT. He was supposed to get it. And being a person who got it, we thought, he would surely find a sensible way between the need to uphold existing law and allowing a promising industry to grow.  How wrong we were.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  These days, nearly everyone in crypto, or close to it, dislikes Gensler’s tenure. He hasn’t provided any legal clarity to token issuers, many say; he hasn’t helped Congress fashion any new crypto-focused legislation (just look at the docket); he’s wound up a lot of people as he pushed an agenda that often seems self-interested and self-centered.  This week, Fortune Magazine took a deep look at Gary’s time at the SEC and put meat on what many of us already know in outline. It’s a great piece based on interviews with “more than 30 financial experts, politicians, and current and former employees from all levels at the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, including agency leaders,” and you should read it. But, in case you don’t have time, we’ll summarize a few of the takeaways here, especially as they relate to crypto.  A political animal  He may be a regulator, but he acts more like a politician.  Gary Gensler previously served as CFTC chairman, taking the reins of a backwater agency following the 2008 financial crisis. He lobbied to expand that agency’s powers in legislation enacted at the time, pushing a raft of new rules and creating office space for CFTC staffers across the country (much of which was left empty because of budget constraints). In 2016, he joined Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and then tied his fortunes to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who then, as now, leads a movement to crack down on Wall Street and crypto.  Now, he apparently has his eyes on becoming Treasury Secretary when the position becomes open again. “The running rumor in D.C. is that Gensler has had his eyes on becoming Treasury secretary since the Obama administration. That assumption was repeated in nearly every interview with Fortune, although always tiptoed around by his allies,” writers Leo Schwartz and Jeff John Roberts say.  Allies and critics all agree on Gensler’s ambition. “Gary Gensler is a politician masquerading as a regulator,” Ritchie Torres, a Democratic congressman who supports the crypto industry, told Fortune.  Many rules, little adoption  In the absence of new legislation from Congress, Gensler has looked to existing laws to regulate the financial sector. That has led to a spate of rule-making from his office, covering areas as diverse as crypto and the way companies report their climate change liabilities. But much of that agenda now apparently appears bogged down in lawsuits and other challenges.  Per Fortune:  “Finalizing rules has turned into a headache for Gensler. According to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Gensler issued 62% and 91% more rule proposals, respectively, than his two most recent predecessors in his first 30 months in office — ranging from how broker-dealers can use predictive analytics about clients to a partial overhaul of the U.S. trading system. Such undertakings require comment periods to solicit industry feedback, however, and Gensler’s ambition has drawn pushback from across the financial world. In August, Bloomberg reported that Gensler’s record of getting his rules adopted was the slowest in decades.”  Gensler’s enforcement actions, meanwhile, have often been hamstrung by lawsuits brought by the companies the SEC has targeted. Ripple (largely) beat back an effort to class XRP as a security that predated Gensler’s tenure. Now Coinbase seems to have a good chance of stymying another action claiming that it operates an illegal securities exchange. Citing legal experts, Fortune said Gensler’s aggressive approach could end up backfiring. “Litigation over [the SEC’s jurisdiction] and others could short-circuit Gensler’s broader agenda, if such suits lead to judicial rulings that curb the agency’s powers,” the authors write.  Turf wars sow confusion  Gensler ran and built up the CFTC, but he’s seeking to limit its remit when it comes to crypto. By arguing that most tokens, bar bitcoin, are securities, Gensler makes the SEC responsible for enacting how those tokens should and shouldn’t be regulated. The CFTC argues that some tokens are more properly commodities, and therefore should be regulated by that agency.  The “commodity-vs.-security debate” isn’t just a matter for the crypto industry, in other words; it matters for regulators and their agencies, often leading to “discord between Gensler’s current agency and his old one,” Schwartz and Roberts said.  Speaking to Fortune, Summer Mersinger, a CFTC commissioner, cites the case of a Coinbase employee who was caught insider-trading. The CFTC wanted to bring its own action, based on its understanding that some of the tokens involved were commodities. The SEC claimed jurisdiction for itself, leading Mersinger to worry that the lawsuit could be thrown out because of uncertainty over which agency held sway. She said relations between the SEC and CFTC are now “more than a little bit strained.”  A CFTC staffer puts it more forcefully. “It’s like a horrible, dysfunctional marriage,” the person told Fortune. “Cooperation between our enforcement and their enforcement is essentially gone.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/29/a-politician-masquerading-as-a-regulator-3-takeaways-from-fortunes-gary-gensler-profile,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf54b5c9850b0e6852765852947ac31079538f1e-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In this week's issue, we highlight November's 19% jump in the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platforms Index (SMT), the biggest gain in 10 months.  Hype is creeping back in too. Our Sam Kessler takes a look at the drama surrounding Blast, the latest entry to the growing competition among Ethereum layer-2 blockchain networks.  We're also covering BanklessDAO's ""education"" proposal, Vitalik Buterin's verbosity, Wormhole's $225 million raise and Bitcoin ""mempool sniping.""  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Network news  BANKLESS BRAND-LASH: In crypto it's never too early to call a trend. And lately, based on a grand total of two data points, various research and educational outlets are trying to get millions of dollars from the layer-2 blockchain project Arbitrum's treasury. So far, they're face-planting. The latest effort came courtesy of BanklessDAO, which submitted a proposal to Arbitrum's affiliated DAO for about $1.8 million in ARB tokens to fund a year-long education initiative, according to a CoinDesk report this week. The cost of the proposal sparked criticism on social media, but also led to aspersions against Bankless HQ, a crypto media outlet whose co-founders started the DAO though now claim to be ""hands off."" Damage control ensued. The episode bears an uncanny resemblance to The Protocol's account just a couple weeks ago of a separate attempt led by the research arm of crypto media firm Blockworks to get more than $2 million in ARB. That proposed expense was compared with the fees that might be paid to ""Harvard lawyers."" It was later shot down by Arbitrum community voters. As to the BanklessDAO fracas, Bankless HQ's leaders are now seeking to ""clarify branding separation.""  The prolific Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin penned a dissertation about his ""warm but nuanced"" feelings about ""techno-optimism."" The Defiant's Cami Russo summarized Buterin's philosophy as advocating for a ""deliberate and balanced path in technological development."" CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn noted that the essay was ""extremely aphoristic, and only slightly repetitive.""

Chainlink Age Consumed Metric Has Observed A Sharp Spike Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, LINK has recently seen a significant movement from old coins. The relevant indicator here is the “Age Consumed,” which tells us whether the dormant Chainlink tokens are on the move or not right now. When the indicator’s value registers a large spike, it’s a sign that the blockchain is currently observing the transfer of a significant number of old coins. Such dormant tokens belong to a cohort called the “long-term holders” (LTHs), made up of the relentless hands of the sector. Related Reading: XRP, BNB Among Altcoins Losing Correlation With Bitcoin: Data As such, this metric surging can be something to watch out for, as it means that these LTHs, who usually remain quiet no matter what’s going on in the wider market, have decided to break their dormancy. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Chainlink Age Consumed over the last few months: The value of the metric appears to have shot up recently | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink Age Consumed indicator has observed a sharp rise recently, implying that the LTHs have been making transactions. At the peak of this latest spike, the metric’s value touched 4.28 billion, which is the highest level seen since the middle of September. Back then, the indicator registered a spike almost double in scale, and interestingly, what followed in the next couple of weeks was a 31% rally as LINK went from $6.36 to $8.22. It’s hard to say if a similar pattern would repeat for Chainlink this time since the LTHs could have broken their silence for several reasons, including for selling. An analyst has pointed out that yesterday (which was about the same time as this spike in the Age Consumed), the whales made many transactions, as the chart below shows. Looks like the metric has spiked up | Source: @ali_charts on X In total, the Chainlink network observed 2,600 transactions valued over $100,000 yesterday. The spike would confirm that the LTHs who broke their dormancy weren’t just ordinary investors but the whales. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Double Its Price If This Barrier Breaks, Analyst Predicts In isolation, it’s hard to say why these two indicators recently observed a spike. Still, when looking at the latest LINK news, perhaps the most likely explanation becomes apparent. Yesterday, Chainlink staking v0.2 went live on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing the v0.1 stakers to migrate toward the new network. Thus, given the close timing of the spikes in the Age Consumed and Whale Transaction Count, it would appear quite probable that these LTHs were making transfers toward the new staking pools.

Users will still be able to redeem their BUSD until February 2024, Binance said in a blog post Wednesday. However, Binance said it would halt withdrawals on Dec. 31 and any remaining BUSD balances will at that point be automatically converted to FDUSD, a stablecoin issued by FD121 Ltd.  BUSD’s current 24-hour trading volume is just under $400 million, according to data by CoinMarketCap. It was around $900 million in August.  Binance’s stablecoin came under regulatory scrutiny in February after the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) ordered Paxos to stop issuing it. Shortly after, Binance was sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for allegedly offering unregistered crypto derivative products in the U.S. and violating federal law.

The IOTA Ecosystem DLT Foundation will be funded by $100 million worth of tokens vested for four years.  Native token of the IOTA ecosystem [IOTA] jumped 43% Wednesday on news about registering a development foundation in Abu Dhabi, the capital of United Arab Emirates.  The IOTA Ecosystem DLT Foundation claims to be the ""first"" foundation being registered under the regulatory framework called the DLT Foundations Regulations, set up by the city's financial watchdog Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), according to an IOTA press release.  The new organization will be funded by $100 million worth of IOTA tokens, locked up for four years, the press release added.  The cryptocurrency's price surged to 25 cents from 17 cents immediately after the announcement, hitting its highest level since February.  The development came after IOTA unveiled plans in September to establish a regulated entity in Abu Dhabi to foster the network's global expansion.  Iota is one of several crypto-adjacent firms that clinched approvals from Abu Dhabi's regulators recently. Paxos also received a go-ahead to operate in the Emirati city Wednesday. Liminal, a digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure provider also secured an in-principle approval from ADGM earlier this month.

20853651,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563073,1701280806,A Golden Opportunity For Ethereum? 600% Buy Signal Returns,"Ethereum has formed a “golden cross” pattern on the 1-week timeframe, marking the second such signal this year. While the long-term implications could be very positive if history repeats itself, there are reasons to temper expectations. A weekly golden cross has formed | ETHUSD on TradingView.com Ethereum Golden Cross And A Possible Target For New ATHs 1W ETHUSD has formed a golden cross for the second time in 2023. A golden cross is a buy signal in moving average-based trading systems. It suggests that the trend is moving in an upward direction and because trends tend to persist, this is notable. The golden signal occurs when a shorter-term moving average (the 50-week MA) crosses through a longer-term moving average (the 200-week MA) from below. A death cross forms when the opposite happens. Related Reading: This Pattern Points To $10,000+ Ethereum Price, But When? The last confirmed golden cross for Ethereum in December 2020 preceded a massive 600% rally over the next year to the asset’s all-time high near $4,900. A repeat move of similar magnitude this time would put Ethereum above $12,000—over six times today’s price of around $2,000. However, it is important to note that not all golden crosses lead to the anticipated upside. In 2023 alone, 1W ETHUSD has death crossed and golden crossed twice now, demonstrating how moving average-based systems are prone to whipsaw without an established trend to follow. Above 20 on the ADX confirms the trend | ETHUSD on TradingView.com An Uptrend Or More Whipsaw? How The ADX Confirms Trends The whipsawing death cross and golden cross price action on the Ethereum 1-week chart failed to generate follow-through in either direction. So how can we be sure that this isn’t yet another premature crossover? This is where the Average Directional Index (ADX) comes in when gauging the validity of moving average crosses. The ADX aims to measure trend strength, typically on a scale of 0 to 100. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond As the 1-week ADX edges up from below 20, it confirms growing momentum that reduces the odds of more whipsawing price action. Traders often use such ADX readings to confirm golden/death crosses and enter only the most high-conviction signals. The 1W ETHUSD Average Directional Index isn’t yet above 20, but is approaching this key level. Above it, it gives the golden cross much more validity.

The capital will support the start of a decentralized mining pool - OCEAN. The new non-custodial pool will be the first of its kind as it will pay the miners their block rewards directly, without meddling by a centralized entity, unlike some of the existing pools, according to a statement.  Long-time Bitcoin core developer and Mummolin co-founder Luke Dashjr said, ""We are launching as the most transparent pool and also the only non-custodial pool where miners are the recipients of new block rewards directly from Bitcoin.""  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  A Bitcoin mining pool is where operators working to confirm transactions on the network join together to coordinate their efforts and then share any resulting rewards with the miners.  The traditional bitcoin mining pool can act as a centralized entity such that it takes custody of the rewards paid by the network and then distributes them among miners, Mummolin's co-founder and president Mark Artymko said in the statement.  ""This gives them the ability to withhold payment from individual miners, whether by their own choice or by legal requirement,"" he added. ""OCEAN’s non-custodial payouts directly to miners from the block reward remove this risk and the pool's undue influence over miners.""  The new pool has received social media praise from industry observers. ""It's a mining pool with more decentralization built into it at the foundation, which [in my opinion] is good for the Bitcoin network,"" said Lyn Alden, the founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.  The new venture is essentially a re-start of Dashjr's previous zero-fee pool Eligius with updated code, said Dashjr in an X post.  ""The old code has already been updated and tested with support for the latest Bitcoin addresses and mining machines,"" he said in a follow-up post.  Barefoot Mining is Ocean's first customer, and the pool expects to roll-out additional phases of Bitcoin decentralization improvements and upgrades in 2024.  The funding is led by Bitcoin advocate and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and includes Accomplice, Barefoot Bitcoin Fund, MoonKite, NewLayer Capital, the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, and other strategic partners.  Bitcoin's censorship problem  Ocean's debut comes as some legacy mining pools have been the subject of controversy for censoring certain transactions, as ""censorship resistance"" is considered by many Bitcoiners to be a cardinal principle of the largest and original blockchain.  Most recently F2Pool - the third biggest Bitcoin mining pool - drew drew ire on social media after a report that it might be censoring transactions from an address subject to U.S. government sanctions.  “OCEAN is solving a problem for Bitcoiners that I think all of us feel—further centralization of pools and mining pools that could plague Bitcoin, and how that risks a bunch of Bitcoin attributes that we hold dear,"" said Dorsey.

42409320,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGRHX,1701277329,Digital Finance Firm SoFi Hands Its Crypto Business to Blockchain.com,"SoFi is handing its crypto customers to Blockchain.com, a move possibly tied to SoFi's decision to become a bank.  In an interview, Blockchain.com President Lane Kasselman said the partnership equates to hundreds of thousands of users and hundreds of millions of dollars.  SoFi Technologies (SOFI), an online bank and financial-services company, is exiting the cryptocurrency business, telling customers they can transfer their digital assets to Blockchain.com's platform or liquidate them.  The closure takes effect on Dec. 19, according to an email it sent customers Wednesday.  SoFi's transition away from directly offering crypto services may be tied to its decision to become a bank holding company. The U.S. Federal Reserve, as part of that approval, told the company that its crypto activities were not permissible under banking rules, though it would be allowed to continue them for two years, with the possibility of extensions, according to a regulatory filing. (Bloomberg reported on SoFi's decision to close and the link to banking regulation earlier Wednesday.)  Blockchain.com President Lane Kasselman said SoFi still wants to offer crypto services to its customers, hence the Blockchain.com partnership.  ""So you'll still be able to link out to crypto products from the SoFi app,"" Kasselman said in an interview on Wednesday. ""You just won't be able to access them within the SoFi domain. This is not dissimilar to how they offer insurance products, for example.""  Kasselman said the partnership equates to hundreds of thousands of users and hundreds of millions of dollars.

XRP Community And Charles Hoskinson Face Off On Tuesday, November 28, an XRP community member, Mr. Huber, took to X (formerly Twitter) and called out Charles Hoskinson. The post was accompanied by a snippet video of Hoskinson calling the XRP community conspiratorial. The post read: I’m sorry, @IOHK_Charles, but for two years you did everything you could to make the #XRPcommunity to look ridiculous and embarrass us in public. I know you offered peace, but only to come out of nowhere and call us crazy conspiracy theorists again. No look at you. It’s funny what can happen in a year, isn’t it? Mr. Huber’s X post criticized the Cardano founder on the previous statements he made towards Ripple. Basically, about Ripple’s allegations of corruption in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ranks. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Offers Perspective On Legal Fallout With The SEC Mr. Huber asserts that Hoskinson assisted in the “trivialization and cover-up of Joseph Lubin’s corruption.” According to Huber, it didn’t help the founder because Cardano’s native coin, ADA, is now categorized as a security by the SEC. In response to the accusations, the co-founder asserted that Huber was unaware that he was paying for Lubin’s price. The Cardano founder stated: You believe that assisting in the trivialization and cover-up of Joseph Lubin’s corruption is a constructive approach to bringing clarity to Cardano. But the opposite is true. Joseph Lubin is smirking in your face because you don’t realize that you are paying for Lubin’s price. Hoskinson further restated that there is no proof of the allegations against the Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin. As Hoskinson believes, Joseph Lubin did not influence the SEC’s decision to treat Ethereum differently than XRP. Hoskinson stated: Still waiting on a single piece of evidence for the latter. If you cannot provide it, then yes, you are spreading conspiracies and slander. That’s what this has been about for two years now. And somehow you guys still fight. Serious Allegations Need Solid Evidence Hoskinson’s criticism of the dissemination of slander and conspiracies highlights the importance of solid evidence before accusing people of serious allegations. However, members of the XRP community have since criticized Charles Hoskinson’s remarks on the issue. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Addresses ETHGate Rumors: Did Ethereum Bribe The SEC To Go After XRP? So far, the Cardano founder asserted that his rejection of the allegations is unrelated to whether Ethereum received a free pass from the SEC. He further discerns between “unsubstantiated conspiracy” theories and what he believes is a valid criticism of regulatory approaches toward cryptocurrencies.

42409329,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGRlI,1701276300,2024 Will Be the Year Tokenization Truly (Finally) Begins,"Everyone from TradFi leaders to the crypto cognoscenti predicts that the tokenization opportunity runs to the tens of trillions. While we’ve already seen some compelling use cases, these are a drop in the ocean compared to the flood of digitized assets that could move on-chain in the next few years.  When will today’s trickle of tokenization turn into a torrent? And what is holding it back?  This October, Forbes published a deep dive into the issue under the provocative headline “Why Tokenization is Failing.” The author, director of digital assets research, Steven Ehrlich, provides a litany of failed or underwhelming digitization projects and concludes that the issue hindering adoption isn’t technology, but trust.  I beg to differ.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The primary reason why the tokenization market isn’t in full flood is technical bottlenecks, limitations around current infrastructure and interoperability – an inevitable fact in a young, nascent space.  The last year, however, has seen incredible progress towards overcoming these issues. While it’s easy to showcase the projects that didn’t deliver, the true story of tokenization in 2023 is about the groundwork being laid that will enable the next wave of tangible on-chain results, driven by the might of major financial players entering the market.  Private Equity Funds And Credit Are Leading The Charge  Speak to anyone intimately acquainted with the tokenization ecosystem, and they’ll tell you that 2024 is full of immense promise. For starters, we see intense interest from private equity funds looking to develop new tokenization vehicles for their investors, even further, putting these ideas into production with haste.  This trend is set to continue into the New Year as TradFi titans, including Hamilton Lane and JP Morgan, develop tokenized funds. Inevitably, we’ll soon see the development of even more structured instruments, including assets built from new revenue sources such as private credit - the logical next step for financial products that are inherently digital and relatively easy to migrate on-chain.  The Inevitable Expansion Into Other Assets  These instruments are just the start, though. The next generation of tokenized assets will include offerings like bonds and equities. In time, real-world assets such as art and automobiles, commodities, and fine wines will be traded on-chain. In fact, it’s already happening, with use cases including fractional ownership of classic artworks.  Tokenized real estate, in particular, could be a significant boon for the market, which has traditionally been complex and slow-moving. Now, not only will these markets become digitally native, but they will also benefit from things like fractional ownership and near-instant settlement.  This stands to make investing more accessible and bring new liquidity into sclerotic markets. Entirely new generations of investors will begin to tap into the possibilities of tokenization and breathe new life into legacy markets. With new institutions and assets will come new payment rails, as well as the requirement for industry-wide standards that make all of these products and markets interoperable.  Not only will this demonstrate the power and utility of tokenization, but it will also foster the trust that Forbes correctly identifies as the key driver of demand. In 2024, we can have every confidence that the flow of new tokenization will turn from a drip-drip into a deluge, marking the most profound revolution in financial affairs for centuries.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Colin Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/29/2024-will-be-the-year-tokenization-truly-finally-begins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74f533926b6639da78c9484c4cd921ebb6b4b51a-3977x2234.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42409332,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGS1p,1701276300,Liquid Staking Tokens Are a Hot Ticket for 2024,"Twenty-six billion dollars. That’s how much money is currently deposited into liquid staking token (LST) protocols, by far the biggest category in decentralized finance (DeFi). And, of course, it is expected to grow even further.  Liquid staking token (LST) is a crypto-specific term that can be hard to grasp at the first sight. It is a utility token issued upon securing proof-of-stake blockchain, like Ethereum, by depositing native cryptocurrency in a dedicated protocol. For example, stETH is an LST issued by Lido when staking ETH on the Ethereum network.  Decentralized applications (dApps), such as Lybra, Prisma, Sommelier, Enzyme, that use these types of tokens are part of the LSTfi (LST finance) category of finance (allowing users to stake their LSTs in a form of collateral, or for other DeFi use cases). In other words, LSTfi is the use of LSTs in DeFi. LST finance (LSTfi) exploded after Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade on April 12 2023, which enabled staked ETH withdrawals.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Here are the three main LST architecture models:  1. Rebase tokens – tokens that automatically adjust their balance in response to deposits and rewards. This process, known as rebasing, typically happens daily. During rebasing, there is no visible transactional activity for the token holders. Examples of such tokens include Lido's stETH and Binance's BETH, both of which are classified as rebase tokens. This type of LST is designed to be user-friendly, as the balance of your LST increases in line with your staking activities.  For example: staking 1,000 ETH at Lido will give you 1000 stETH, which, after one week, should amount to about 1,000.67 stETH (at today’s 3.5% APR).  2. Rewards-bearing tokens – tokens that increase in value over time, with the value and rewards determined by the changing exchange rate between the token and the staked asset. The quantity of LST stays the same, but its rate varies. This single-token model is convenient, but less straightforward than rebase tokens. Holders benefit from rising rewards, examples of which include rETH, cbETH, swETH, osETH, and ETHx.  For example: staking 1,000 ETH at Stader will give you about 989.78 ETHx that after one week will be the same amount of ETHx, but worth about 1,000.68 ETH (at today’s 3.56% APR).  3. Wrapped tokens – certain LST are available in wrapped versions. After wrapping, these tokens no longer experience automatic balance adjustments and become reward-bearing tokens. Unlike rebasing, which occurs without any transactions, changes in the balance of wrapped tokens are achieved through actions like minting, burning, or transferring. The rewards are integrated into the exchange rate. Wrapped LSTs, such as stETH and BETH, often see higher popularity and volume in DeFi and trading sectors because they aren't subject to rebasing.  For example: wrapping 1,000 stETH at Lido will give you about 874.62 wstETH that after one week will be the same amount of wstETH but worth about 1,000.67 ETH (at today’s 3.5% APR).  LSTs Types by Architecture Models (Source: RedStone’s LSTfi report)  Liquid staking tokens play an essential role in the DeFi ecosystem, offering users a way to participate in cryptocurrency staking without the hassles of running validator nodes and managing hardware and software. As the DeFi landscape continues to grow, liquid staking tokens will keep providing users with opportunities to earn rewards and participate in cryptocurrency staking with ease.  LST & LSTfi is here to stay. Therefore, it is vital to understand the mechanism behind them and major players on the market. In 2024, my advice is to keep eye on the trending LST protocols, LST-backed stablecoins and put a lot of attention to restaking space, especially with the upcoming mainnet launch of Eigenlayer that is expected in the late March of next year.

Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo issued a wide-ranging warning about illicit finance in the crypto industry in a speech he's set to deliver at a Blockchain Association event in Washington. He aimed some of that attention at stablecoins. ""We cannot allow dollar-backed stablecoin providers outside the United States to have the privilege of using our currency without the responsibility of putting in place procedures to prevent terrorists from abusing their platform,"" he said in the prepared remarks.  Adeyemo referenced his earlier speech at CoinDesk's Consensus 2022 that highlighted crypto as a ""tremendous opportunity"" for innovation, pointing out he ""also made clear the importance of industry proactively taking steps to prevent digital assets from being used by transnational criminal organizations, terrorists, and rogue states."" That opening, however, hasn't been fully embraced by the industry, he said today.  ""While some have heeded our calls and taken steps to prevent illicit activity, the lack of action by too many firms – both large and small – represents a clear and present risk to our national security,"" Adeyemo said.  He cited the U.S. authorities' recent settlement with Binance, saying the company was used by terrorists, drug traffickers and perpetrators of child sexual abuse.  ""I want to directly address those within the digital asset industry who believe they are above the law, those that willfully turn a blind eye to the law, and those that promote assets and services that aid criminals, terrorists, and rogue states,"" he said. ""My message is simple: We will find you and hold you accountable.""  He suggested the crypto sector could follow in the footsteps of the U.S. banking industry in its efforts to set up information exchanges about bad actors.  Also on Wednesday, the Treasury sanctioned another crypto mixing service – Sinbad – saying it supported transactions tied to North Korean hacking.

USTC and LUNC underpin the Terra ecosystem, which collapsed last May.  TerraClassicUSD (USTC) and its sister token Terra luna classic [LUNC] – remnants of the blown-up Terra blockchain – skyrocketed this week, fueled by a new Binance perpetuals contract listing and the emergence of a bitcoin-focused revamp and airdrop plan.  LUNC is up roughly 60% this week, including a nearly 20% rise over the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows. USTC, meanwhile, has almost quadrupled in price. For perspective, the USTC rally has only brought the price to $0.05 versus its original price peg of $1.  The gains occurred as Binance, which remains the world's largest crypto exchange despite its regulatory issues, on Monday started offering perpetual contracts for USTC with up to 50x leverage.  Increasing anticipation of a USTC revamp plan that would use bitcoin [BTC] as a foundation perhaps also fueled the rally. Bitcoin-focused payment project Mint Cash recently outlined a vision for a successor of Terra's failed stablecoin, this time being collateralized by BTC to mint tokens.  The developer team also revealed a few days ago that they are working on an airdrop plan for USTC and LUNC holders.  The recent developments unleashed a speculative frenzy around the token. Trading volume with USTC has exploded in the last few days, peaking at times above $1 billion in 24-hour activity, dwarfing the less than $10 million average earlier this month, CoinGecko data shows.  Remnants of Terra  Terra luna classic [LUNC] and USTC are remnants of the sister tokens that underpinned the once-huge, failed Terra ecosystem, developed by Terraform Labs and helmed by co-founder Do Kwon, who was arrested earlier this year. USTC was an algorithmic stablecoin, while LUNC – then named LUNA – was used to balance the stablecoin at a $1 peg. The design proved to be unsustainable and the tokens fell into a hyperinflationary death spiral last May, collapsing the whole multibillion-dollar Terra ecosystem in spectacular fashion.  Read more: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this February charged Terraform Labs and Kwon with ""orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud involving an algorithmic stablecoin."" Kwon was arrested in Montenegro with forged passports in March and last week a local court approved extraditing him to the U.S. or South Korea.  Soon after the collapse, developers deployed a new version of the Terra blockchain with a brand new native token called LUNA, consequently renaming the old blockchain to Terra Classic and the tokens to LUNC and USTC.  Some developers, however, remained committed to revive the ecosystem around Terra Classic. The community voted to stop minting – creating – new USTC tokens to help reduce its hyperinflated supply through token burning schemes.",POSITIVE,LUNC,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | LUNC | TRADING | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/29/terras-ustc-gains-300-as-bitcoin-focused-comeback-plan-binance-perpetuals-listing-fuel-speculative-frenzy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15221c918aea2c7d8ac7bfb106899fb4ded39c46-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sinbad's website was also seized by the FBI, Dutch Financial Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD), Openbaar Ministerie (the Netherlands' public prosecutor's office) and Finnish National Bureau of Investigation.  A Treasury press release described Sinbad as ""a virtual currency mixer that serves as a key money-laundering tool of the OFAC-designated Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored cyber hacking group of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).""  Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, designated two Bitcoin addresses and two email addresses tied to Sinbad, banning all U.S. persons and anyone who transacts with the global financial system from interacting with the addresses in future.  According to a Blockchain.com block explorer, one address currently holds around 0.35 BTC (worth around $13,000) at the moment, but has received a hair over 15 BTC (worth around $570,000 at current prices) overall.  The other address, designated an alternate, holds around $67 worth of bitcoin.  Sinbad processed funds from the hacks of Horizon Bridge and Axie Infinity, the release said. It's also moved funds tied to ""sanctions evasion, drug trafficking, the purchase of child sexual abuse materials and additional illicit sales on darknet marketplaces.""  Sinbad is a relatively young mixer, crypto analytics service Chainalysis said, which began advertising in October 2022.  Fellow analytics service Elliptic claimed Sinbad was also used to move some of the $35 million stolen from Atomic Wallet earlier this year.  The Treasury Department's sanctions watchdog has previously designated Tornado Cash and other mixers as being bad actors for allowing illicit activity. Tornado Cash in particular saw similar North Korea allegations when OFAC sanctioned it last year.  A U.S. Department of Justice spokesperson referred CoinDesk to the FBI when asked for comment. The FBI did not immediately return an email.

However, this growth is still small when compared to other popular cryptocurrencies, as DOGE is still yet to reach $0.1 this year.

On the price action end of things, DOGE has increased by 9.00% in a 7-day timeframe as most cryptocurrencies start to turn a profit again after a few weeks of consolidation. At the same time, IntoTheBlock’s large transaction metric which measures transactions with a value larger than $100,000 has been increasing, reaching a total of $2.08 billion in the past seven days. Balance Among Addresses Despite the rise in addresses with a balance, the holding distribution shows that most of the tokens are concentrated in a few addresses. Around 4.48 million addresses representing 95.5% of the total addresses hold just 1.59% of the total circulating supply. On the other hand, just 700 addresses hold 81% of the total supply. Source: IntoTheBlock There’s also been a surge in the number of daily transactions, with a 102.09% increase in the number of new addresses and an 89.70% increase in the number of active addresses. Notably, there were 221,330 active DOGE addresses on November 27th. According to IntoTheBlock, this is most likely driven by Dogecoin Doginals. DOGE’s ascent to $0.1 this year seems bleak at the moment, as the crypto will have to go on another 25% increase from its current price in December. DOGE is currently trading around a prior resistance at the $0.081 level and has formed support just around the $0.071 level. A continued inflow into addresses could see DOGE break above the resistance, and continue its price surge. The next hurdle would be to break above $0.087 before getting to $0.1 for the first time this year.

Copper Securities, the new entity offering execution and custody services, is working with the emirate's Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) to have the necessary approvals in place by early 2024.  The move has been facilitated by Copper’s recent acquisition of Securrency Capital, an Abu Dhabi-based division of the Securrency tokenization platform that was not included in the acquisition of Securrency Inc. by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC) in October.  Copper joins a growing cohort of crypto businesses looking to the United Arab Emirates, which offers greater regulatory clarity for digital assets than many other jurisdictions. Copper CEO Dmitry Tokarev referred to Abu Dhabi as ""the capital of capital,"" pointing to the region’s accumulation of institutional assets.  ""Abu Dhabi is more institutional and more focused around asset management, and that's exactly what Copper is; we only have institutional clients,"" Tokarev said in an interview. ""While there isn't a huge retail market here, you will find all the big institutions, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds.""  A steady convergence between traditional financial (TradFi) plumbing and blockchain technology is underway, as banks and asset managers push to tokenize traditional financial assets.

OpBNB's transaction count crossed the 20 million mark last week.  BNB Chain developers are looking to more than double the transaction speed and slash network fees by 90% as part of a new technical roadmap for layer-2 network opBNB, a representative shared with CoinDesk over email.  The increase will take processing to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) from around 4,000 and cut the cost to $0.0005 within six months, according to the plan. The first fee cut, to $0.001 from $0.005, is scheduled for Dec. 4.  The network is based on Optimism’s OP Stack. The targeted speed would place opBNB among the fastest layer-2 networks, with popular offshoot Arbitrum capable of a claimed 40,000 TPS.  A layer 2 network is an off-chain system built on top of a base, or layer-1, blockchain. The OP Stack is the set of software that powers Optimism, an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, that developers can use to create their own networks.  The number of users on opBNB has climbed steadily since its September release. Transactions reached a record 5.4 million last week, taking lifetime transactions to over 20 million. It has recorded a peak of 645 minting transactions per second.  The developers say they expect opBNB’s gas limit per block to double to 200 million per second. The gas limit is the maximum price a user is willing to pay when sending a transaction. Higher limits can help speed up transactional processing during times of high demand.  The upgrades are scheduled over the next year and are expected to help opBNB support on-chain games and high-frequency decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | ARB | BNB | OP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/29/bnb-chains-opbnb-developers-look-to-double-speed-in-new-roadmap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27cf527873a45e9f9ba5c554e9596323d1e0a0ca-4998x2811.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token will be available for non-accredited investors with low minimum investment levels, making it accessible to retail investors who usually cannot take stakes in private companies without accreditation and large checks.  The way it works is when one of the companies has a liquidity event such as a dividend payment or other cash-generating occurrence, profits flow into a Republic Note dividend pool. Every time the pool reaches $2 million, Note investors get USDC dividends sent to their digital wallets.  “The Republic Note’s listing is not just a milestone for Republic – it represents a shift in the landscape of private equity,"" co-founder and CEO Kendrick Nguyen said in a statement. ""Owning even one Republic Note can unlock an important new level of accessibility, transparency, and liquidity to private equity.”  The path to the Republic Note’s listing has garnered a significant amount of interest, raising over $30 million from Binance and the Avalanche Foundation as well as individual investors in a private sale before the listing, according to the statement.  Since 2016, Republic has deployed over $2.6 billion into privately held ventures, according to the release.

20847050,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562978,1701266445,"Dogecoin To Double Its Price If This Barrier Breaks, Analyst Predicts","An analyst has explained how Dogecoin breaking the $0.087 barrier could open the path to DOGE price levels nearly double the recent ones. Dogecoin Has Three Important Lines Converging At $0.087 Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed what the weekly chart of DOGE is looking like right now in terms of some important historical lines. In particular, the levels of interest here are the 100-week EMA, 200-week EMA, and 0.786 Fibonacci. A “moving average” (MA) refers to an analytical tool that calculates the mean of any given quantity over a specific period of time, and as its name implies, it moves in time and changes its value as the quantity fluctuates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Only Just Starting, According To This Metric This basic tool is quite useful as it smooths out the curve by removing local fluctuations, making a study of long-term trends easier to perform. In the context of the current topic, though, a normal MA isn’t of focus, but rather a modified form called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA works like the usual MA, except it places a greater weight on the most recent readings of the quantity. What this means is that the older the reading, the less weightage it has in the metric, so the line’s changes reflect the latest price direction more strongly. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 100-week and 200-week EMAs for Dogecoin, as well as the weekly price curve of the meme coin: Looks like the asset's weekly value has been interacting with these lines recently | Source: @ali_charts on X As is visible from the above graph, these two Dogecoin EMAs have approached each other recently and have converged into a narrow range around the $0.087 level. In the past, these two EMAs of the cryptocurrency have posed resistance to the price and it appears that the weekly chart of Dogecoin has been struggling with them again, as it has been finding rejection here during the past three weeks. These two lines aren’t the only ones converging near $0.087, however; it would appear that the 0.786 Fibonacci level is doing the same. The Fibonacci levels listed in the chart are some ratios derived from the famous Fibonacci series. In this series, dividing any number (except for the first few) by its succeeding number always gives a ratio of about 0.618. The square root of this number is 0.786, which is the level the analyst has marked here. Related Reading: XRP, BNB Among Altcoins Losing Correlation With Bitcoin: Data Dogecoin thus has a major wall at $0.087, made up of the convergence of all these historically significant lines. “Breaking past this barrier could open the gates for DOGE to nearly double its price, aiming for a target of $0.14,” explains the analyst. DOGE Price Dogecoin has observed a surge back above the $0.080 mark during the past day, as the below chart shows. It now remains to be seen if the coin will go on to retest this $0.087 level that might be so crucial for the coin.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  For crypto, things are going as expected, according to Standard Chartered Bank, which reiterated its April forecast that bitcoin [BTC] would reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. The bank's Geoff Kendrick and team wrote the next catalyst will be the approval of several U.S.-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF). “We think a number of spot ETFs will now be approved in Q1-2024 for both BTC and [ETH], paving the way for institutional investment,” they said. The team also noted that the next Bitcoin ‘halving’ – a mechanism to limit supply and expected to take place in late April 2024 – will be another source of price upside.  Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Genesis Global have reached a repayment plan to settle their lawsuit, according to a new bankruptcy filing. In September, lending firm Genesis filed a lawsuit against DCG, alleging wrongful possession of over $620 million in loans and seeking repayment, interest, and fees amid Genesis' bankruptcy proceedings. So far, DCG has paid approximately $227.3 million of the $620 million it owes. The deal would see DCG pay another $275 million to Genesis in three installments, partially in U.S. dollars and bitcoin, due by April. The deal also includes a $35 million upfront payment and a $10 million holdback from the recent sale of CoinDesk. According to the filing, DCG is also pegging Grayscale Trust shares as security. The deal still needs to be approved by creditors.  The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission is warning users in the country that it may soon block access to Binance as the exchange is operating without a license. In a notice, the regulator said that Binance is not authorized to sell or offer securities to the public. The regulator also said Binance is actively promoting crypto trading to Filipinos on social media, an offense that may make the promoter criminally liable. Binance recently agreed to pay U.S. authorities $4.3 billion to settle charges that it failed to maintain a proper anti-money laundering program, operated an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and violated sanctions law.

20845036,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562974,1701261946,"Trading Guru John Bollinger Warns Of Buying Litecoin, Here’s Why","In his latest analysis, legendary trader John Bollinger has expressed concerns over Litecoin’s performance, particularly in comparison to Bitcoin. Bollinger, known for developing the popular technical analysis tool Bollinger Bands, highlighted a worrying pattern in the Litecoin market. He remarked, “I was asked for an analysis of LTCBTC. The thing that concerns me the most is its underperformance vs Bitcoin. From a price perspective the controlling LTCUSD feature is the 2 bar reversal at the lower Bollinger Band which is typically considered a bearish signal by traders.” Bollinger’s Bearish Litecoin Prediction Explained The chart of the LTC/USD pair provided by Bollinger on November 28, 2023, shows Litecoin’s price action in relation to its Bollinger Bands on both a daily and weekly scale. The price is currently hovering around $69.566, which is significantly lower than the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting a lack of bullish momentum. Related Reading: Litecoin Sustains 4-Month Run With 37% Gain, Beating Most Of Its Peers – Details The Bands form by plotting a range of standard deviations above and below a simple moving average, commonly enveloping the price action. In this chart, the daily vs. weekly candles chart shows that the LTC/USD price is struggling beneath the midpoint of these bands, which is a bearish indication. The price currently near $69.566 is substantially below the upper band level of around $90, which represents a potential resistance level. The Bollinger Bands (BB) on the chart are set with a 20-period moving average with a 2 standard deviation range. Bollinger’s analysis points to a ‘2 bar reversal’ pattern at the lower band. This pattern emerges when a bar reaches a high above the preceding bar but then closes below the close of that same previous bar, hinting at a possible reversal from the uptrend. Such a pattern took place near the lower band, indicating that any effort to drive the price higher meets with resistance, and the prevailing selling pressure is taking hold. Related Reading: Litecoin Whales Are Back In The Game, Can Price Reach $100? The Bollinger %B indicator is also crucial here as it compares the price of Litecoin to the range defined by the Bollinger Bands. A %B value below 0.5 indicates that Litecoin’s price sits nearer to the lower band than to the upper band, potentially signaling weakness. The chart shows the indicator failing to cross the 0.5 level after a plunge toward 0, signifying that the price frequently touches or falls below the lower band. LTC Price Under Pressure The Bollinger Band Width (BBW) serves as another indicator, measuring volatility by assessing the Bollinger Bands’ width. A narrowing of the Bands, as seen in the latter part of the chart, suggests a decrease in volatility and often precedes a significant price movement. In this context, the BBW’s narrowing on the Litecoin chart might indicate that the market is tensing, possibly gearing up for an impending breakout or breakdown. When Bollinger mentions Litecoin’s underperformance relative to Bitcoin, it’s important to note that Bitcoin often leads the crypto market trend. If Litecoin is not keeping up with Bitcoin’s movements, it could suggest a lack of confidence or interest from traders in altcoins (as the current rise in Bitcoin dominance shows) and Litecoin specifically. In summary, Bollinger’s technical analysis indicates that Litecoin is in a precarious position. The price action at the lower Bollinger Band, the bearish ‘2 bar reversal’ pattern, the sub-0.5 Bollinger %B values, and the narrowing BBW all suggest that Litecoin may continue to see downward pressure in the near term. At press time, Litecoin traded at $70.05. The 1-day chart of LTC/USD shows that the altcoin fell below the key support of the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $69.98 two days ago. A retest is currently taking place, a daily close above this is of utmost importance for the Litecoin price.

42409345,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGbJ9,1701259200,"Blast's One-Week, $600M Haul Shows Promise of Yield, Pitfalls of Hype","On its face, the idea behind Blast doesn't seem so objectionable: a layer-2 blockchain atop Ethereum that pays interest to depositors – a differentiator that might help a new player stand out versus the current market leaders, Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, or against dozens of other competing networks.  Clearly there's something attractive about the proposition, because in just a week since the project was unveiled, some $603 million has flooded into Blast, an amount that would immediately rank the project as the third-biggest Ethereum layer-2 network. By comparison, Base, backed by the prominent U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, has amassed just $582 million since its launch a few months ago, a much slower rate of deposits that was nonetheless considered a coup when the chain launched.  But Blast's marketing pitch has attracted critics alongside the crypto dollars, including a public scolding from a key financial backer, the venture-capital firm Paradigm, over how the project went about its splashy introduction.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Blast's actual network isn't expected to launch until next year, but its leaders have begun accepting deposits anyway – promising ""native yields"" and dangling the prospect of an eventual token airdrop to early birds. People can earn ""blast points"" by depositing funds into an Ethereum wallet associated with the yet-to-launch Blast chain, or by inviting others to do the same. It's all neatly packaged on Blast's cyberpunk-themed website, which displays a videogame-like leaderboard showing who has earned the most points – with the highest-ranked among them entitled to a larger share of soon-to-be airdropped tokens.  Aside from the garishness of it all, there's been criticism of what some commentators describe as a potentially risky setup, where depositors are essentially relying on faith in an undisclosed group of ""engineers"" – as opposed to more robust security measures – to safeguard their cryptocurrency ahead of Blast's real launch. For now, user deposits into Blast's crypto wallet can't be withdrawn. And at least initially, the juicy yields won't come from any internal workings of Blast, but from routing deposits to other yield-paying projects, primarily the liquid-staking protocol Lido, adding yet another layer of risk.  Without any detailed technical specs, it's unclear so far what Blast's yet-to-exist network will even be; the primary disclosure is that it will be an optimistic rollup that pays interest.  In an earlier era, such as in the halcyon days of degenerate decentralized finance (DeFi) in 2020, when crypto traders drunk on sky-high-returns happily overlooked project technicals in favor of vague promises, Blast's approach might have seemed par for the course. But the recent blowback speaks to how cautious some corners of the industry have become in recent months. Industry figures are afraid of getting swept up in the same empty excitement that fueled – and crashed – the last DeFi market, when crypto's reputation was tarnished by a downward spiral of token collapses, exchange failures and criminal charges.  ""Much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team,"" Dan Robinson, a researcher at Paradigm, which was one of Blast's lead investors, wrote on X. Robinson's thread marked a rare instance in which a major venture firm publicly rebuked one of its own portfolio companies.  Robinson expressed strong disagreement with Blast's approach of accepting deposits into a token bridge – currently just a glorified Ethereum multisig wallet – before launching a real network, and without allowing withdrawals.  The marketing strategy ""crossed lines in both messaging and execution,"" according to Robinson.  Neither Robinson nor Blast founder Tieshun Roquerre responded to requests for comment for this story.  Paradigmatic provenance  Paradigm, whose partners include a Coinbase co-founder, Fred Ehrsam, is looked to as a beacon of crypto investing – known for its widely-read research reports and think pieces on the state of the space.  For startups in Paradigm's orbit, the ""Backed by Paradigm"" badge serves as a stamp of credibility, the idea being that the firm ostensibly does extensive due diligence on portfolio companies – to reduce the chance that a project might be one of myriad Ponzi-like schemes, rugpulls or other scams that are so prevalent in crypto.  It's possible that Paradigm's participation provided an extra dose of confidence to traders as they have poured money into Blast in recent days.  Blast backlash  Many investors are still jaded by their scorchings from Terra (LUNA), Olympus (OHM), and other buzzy projects from DeFi's 2019-2021 heyday – hype-driven cryptocurrency experiments that ballooned into billion-dollar behemoths before crashing to pennies.  Afraid of falling prey to empty buzz yet again, some traders and investors have tried pushing the industry into a new era – to clean up its act, at least as far as most marketing is concerned.  A more sober set of norms has come to typify the crypto startup landscape. A focus on ""zero-knowledge proofs"" and other technical nomenclature has supplanted percentage-point-yield figures in ad copy and pitch decks. ""Layer 2"" infrastructure extending Ethereum has replaced ""yield farming"" as the product category du jour favored by investors.  Blast's product pitch, which earned it $20 million in funding from Paradigm and other backers, wasn't completely out of step with the times.  Similar at a high level to layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism and Coinbase's Base chain, Blast would ""settle"" user transactions on the ""Layer 1"" Ethereum network, but function separately as a way to ramp up bandwidth.  Without much differentiating it mechanically from other layer 2 up-and-comers, however, Blast's marketing highlighted its plan to pay ""yields"" to users, in addition to an invitation-based reward system.  Blast's big promises  Blast made big promises that evoked crypto of old – instructing users to ""lock up"" their funds in a ""bridge"" for a period of three months in exchange for ""risk-free"" yields. The platform itself won't launch until February. Until then, users will be unable to withdraw their funds.  Paradigm's Robinson took issue with this lock-up mechanic, saying ""we don’t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent.""  Crypto history is filled with ""rug pulls"" – where someone creates a project and then runs off with the funds. There's no evidence that Blast is a scam, but similar setups have been employed by fraudsters in the past, where user funds were ""locked"" for some period, and then the whole pot was stolen. Notoriously, crypto bridges – used to transfer tokens between blockchains – have also been frequent targets for crypto-savvy hackers.  Blast's bridge, where the half-billion-plus dollars of locked user funds now sit, is controlled by a ""multisig"" wallet – a set-up that, in Blast's case, requires three of five individual ""signers"" to approve transactions. Blast defended the system in a thread on X, positing that ""Multisigs can be highly effective if used properly. This is why L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and now Blast use a multisig model.""  Blast has said nothing about who is behind its multisig, meaning users who deposit their money into the Blast bridge are entrusting their money to an unknown set of entities. This isn't completely out of the norm; Optimism keeps its multisig signers anonymous as a security measure, as do some other projects. But the fact that Blast is so far just a multisig wallet – rather than a bona fide bridge or blockchain – has fueled skeptics.  Fear of missing out  Blast's FOMO-inducing ""native yield"" and ""blast point"" mechanics, center-stage in its marketing, were also key focal points for critics.  Yield is a genuinely useful tactic for attracting users, and Blast's promised yields – in the 4-5% range, plus extra ""blast points"" – pale in comparison to the obviously-too-good-to-be-true 1000%+ yields promised in the days of ""yield farming,"" when projects would just mint tokens willy-nilly in an unsustainable short-term bid to prop up yields.  Blast's use of the phrase ""risk-free"" interest – possible due to money re-invested behind the scenes into interest-bearing assets like staked Ether – raised red flags. Countless projects have appealed to users with promises of high yields, only to collapse entirely once returns decrease.  Blast also introduced a gamified invite system that rewards users for sharing the project – teasing the prospect of airdropped tokens to users who issue the most invites. Incentivized invites aren't new. Friend.tech, a popular social app on Coinbase's Base chain, recently employed a similar model, to much success.  But such systems can bear a striking resemblance to multi-level marketing, and crypto-veterans have a particular allergy to the tactics given the industry's sordid history with pyramid-shaped business models.  The Lido link  Blast was founded by Roquerre, who typically operates under the pseudonym ""Pacman"" and initially came to prominence as the founder of the NFT marketplace Blur. In a thread on X last week, Roquerre attributed some of the Blast blowback to ""misunderstandings.""  ""There's a meme going around that Blast is a Ponzi,"" Roquerre wrote. ""The yield that Blast provides users can feel too good to be true, so this meme is understandable. But to put it simply, the yield Blast provides comes (initially) from Lido and MakerDAO,"" another crypto protocol.  That the lion's share of Blast's half-a-billion dollars in deposits has been poured directly into Lido, a liquid Ethereum staking protocol with deep Paradigm ties, only added to the scrutiny.  Paradigm has been in the crosshairs of Blast's critics since the project was first announced, with some arguing that an influential firm like Paradigm – which backs Lido, Flashbots and a number of other industry cornerstones – shouldn't have its fingerprints on a project with such controversial tactics, particularly given the potential for conflicts of interest.  ""Paradigm had zero involvement in Blast's [go-to-market],"" Roquerre wrote, adding that ""they probably would have asked me to change a lot about Blast's launch if they had been involved,"" and in fact did request changes to Blast's strategy post-launch.  While Paradigm did not pull its funding from Blast, and Robinson's statement did not address the Lido ties, his comments did appear to put some onlookers at ease.  ""Many of the tactics displayed with Blast go fully against the entire ethos of crypto, in exchange for some guerrilla marketing benefits,"" wrote Jordi Alexander, a blockchain investor who was one of the most vocal critics of Terra ahead of its spectacular 2022 collapse. ""I am completely in favor of a seminal fund in our industry, that is playing a longer-term game, clarifying publicly when their fund's reputation is attached to an approach that has made many of us in the space uncomfortable.""  As the columnist David Z. Morris wrote on his Substack, ""Paradigm probably can’t just take the money back, and this is only a minor blow to their reputation, as long as Blast’s creators actually don’t rug.""  Calculated risk?  It's unclear whether Blast's approach was really all that much of a miscalculation in pure business terms. Even if a vocal contingent of the crypto Twitterati finds Blast's methods distasteful, the project has attracted eye-watering demand in dollar terms – this while the rest of DeFi is in a market slump.  The money that's flooded into Blast may have come predominantly from a few big backers, or from mercenary yield farmers who will leave as soon as they snag their Blast airdrop.  But if the funds in Blast do remain safe, and if the chain opens in a few months as promised, the project's big initial splash could prove a winning gambit – helping Blast to elbow its way into the competitive turf war between similar layer 2s.  By then, the original marketing sins might be long forgotten.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/29/blasts-one-week-600m-haul-shows-promise-of-yield-pitfalls-of-hype,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f720a75fe897918c4cca00ac0476485923e83649-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409348,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGbPl,1701258895,"Crypto Firms That Act Like Banks Should Be Regulated Like Them, ECB Official Says","If a crypto firm starts acting like a bank, it should be regulated like one, which won't be easy, said Andrea Enria, chair of the supervisory board at the European Central Bank (ECB), during a Wednesday interview with four European Union media outlets.  The ECB's planned digital euro and private crypto aren't a threat to the role of banks, Enria said. Supervision of crypto companies, however, could be more challenging than overseeing banks because certain services provided by the sector can ""to a large extent, mimic the provision of bank-like services"" in payments as well as decentralized finance (DeFi).  ""And here the difficulties are serious,"" Enria said. ""For us, there will mainly be the issue of deterritorialization – the fact that these entities sometimes do not have precise headquarters.""  The world's largest crypto exchange, Binance, which recently reached a landmark $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. government for serving local customers without the right approvals, famously operates globally without a headquarters. The revelations following the 2022 collapse of multibillion-dollar enterprise FTX showed ""a lot of opacity"" within crypto firms.  ""You have an issue of consolidation. You have seen in the case of FTX that you cannot have a group-wide perspective of the business and of the risks that these entities take,"" Enria said.  A lack of an issuer in the case of popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin [BTC], or the absence of a clear entity within DeFi projects also makes these elements hard to supervise, he said.  ""That will be the challenge for us more than for the banks. The issue will be to make sure that once somebody is conducting banking activity, it’s brought under the remit of banking regulation and supervision,"" Enria said.

The DOGE-1 satellite is being developed by space technology firm Geometric Energy Corporation, which announced the project in May 2021. The satellite will be launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.  “The National Telecommunications and Information Administration approved DOGE-1 X-Band (0083-EX-CN-2022 on http://ntia.doc.gov),” confirmed Samuel Reid, CEO of Geometric Energy Corporation, in an X post. “We have yet to get the FCC license grant which will address X-Band and S-Band.”  A miniature screen on the DOGE-1 satellite will display advertisements, images and logos, which will subsequently be broadcast to the Earth. DOGE-1 was the first satellite launch to be paid for its entirety in DOGE tokens.  The launch of DOGE-1 was first announced by SpaceX founder Elon Musk in 2021 as a rideshare abroad a collaborative rocket launch between Intuitive Machines and NASA, the U.S. space program.  However, that has been repeatedly postponed by Intuitive Machines' launch provider SpaceX, which in turn postponed DOGE-1’s planned launch from 2022 to the now-targeted January 2024.  DOGE-1 is one of the two dogecoin-related missions planned in the coming months.  Earlierthis month, Dogecoin developers said a physical dogecoin token could reach Earth’s moon in a space payload mission planned by Pittsburg-based firm Astrobotic.

The cryptocurrency crossed $38,000 even on the back of the SEC’s move to delay two Spot Bitcoin ETFs. SEC Delays Templeton And Hashdex Bitcoin Spot ETF On November 28, the SEC delayed its decision on Templeton and Hashdex’s Spot Bitcoin ETF application. As part of the announcement, the Commission also invited comments on what has been its major concern up till now: the issue of fraud and manipulation and whether or not the surveillance agreements in place can help curb that. Related Reading: Analyst Uses 5200% Impulse Against Bitcoin To Predict XRP Price Surge To $9.6 Despite this development, the crypto market seemed unperturbed as Bitcoin crossed $38,000, and altcoins also posted some gains. This would come as a surprise to many, considering that the latest momentum in the market has been attributed majorly to the possibility of a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. A plausible explanation could be the fact that investors are certain that approval is imminent, irrespective of the actions of the Commission. This is evident in the fact that institutional money keeps flowing into the crypto market. CoinShare’s latest report showed that the crypto market, last week, saw its largest weekly inflow since late 2021. Meanwhile, the SEC’s latest delay is an interesting one, considering that a decision on both applications wasn’t due until January 1, 2024. This has led to several speculations as to whether or not this move still means that approval is on the horizon. BTC price at $38,140 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com SEC’s Latest Delay May Be A Good Sign In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart questioned the SEC’s actions and what it could mean for a potential approval. He reasoned that the SEC’s decision could be setting things up for a “full wave of approvals” in early January. The analyst had previously put the likelihood of an approval in January 2024 at 90%. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 4400% XRP Price Surge To $27, Here’s When He further stated that the delay on Hashdex’s application (Hashdex’s announcement came shortly after Templeton’s) confirmed his reasoning. He believes that the SEC is moving to set up all applicants for potential approval by January 10, 2024. He quickly noted that these approvals would be for the 19b-4 and didn’t necessarily mean an immediate launch. Scott Johnsson, a notable attorney from Davis Polk, also shared the same sentiments as Seyffart. He stated that the SEC might have chosen to delay these applications early so that the comment period could end before January 10, 2024. That way, they can approve all applications at the same time.

The round was led by G1.VC, Spirit Blockchain, Good News Ventures, K2.CA and Atoia Ventures, with Mintfox also participating, according to an emailed announcement on Wednesday.  The Toronto-based company is targeting other businesses – primarily crypto exchanges – that wish to offer trading and yield to their clients. Coinchange offers this through its Earn API service to provide yield-farming strategies in decentralized finance (DeFi) markets. An API, or application programming interface, allows one computer to query and retrieve information from another.  Coinchange assets are managed on-chain, meaning there is no need for centralized counterparties for custody or lending, reducing the counterparty risk to clients, the firm said.  Such risks were highlighted in the fallout from the collapse of FTX in November last year, which rippled through to other centralized platforms with exposure to the bankrupt exchange. Some 232,000 users of crypto exchange Gemini's Earn service, for example, had over $1 billion frozen by lender Genesis, Gemini's partner in the program.

(Rating Downgrade),"Summary Coinbase Global's stock has experienced a significant price increase of +247% during 2023, driven by the renewed rise in cryptocurrency pricing/interest. However, an uncertain regulatory environment for crypto trading, on top of analyst-projected operating losses until 2027, raises doubts about COIN's future. Weak technical trading indicators and momentum patterns suggest investors sell and/or avoid the stock. I wrote a bearish take on Coinbase Global (COIN) at $244 a share in September 2021 here , months before its all-time peak. One of the IPO darlings of the cryptocurrency craze and leading exchanges/brokers of decentralized blockchain assets that year seemed "" too good to be true "" at the time, with limited visibility on future operating results. Given wild swings in cryptocurrency values and ""exchanges"" popping up everywhere, I was very concerned about competition. So much so, I believed sustainable operating profitability would be a tall order (outside of riding crypto price changes for its own account). After a catastrophic drop into the $30s for price (90% from all-time highs in 2021), I flipped to a somewhat bullish view in early January 2023 here , explaining the potential contrarian excuses for a decent rally in the quote. Coinbase had reached the EXACT opposite investor sentiment situation as the mindless euphoria of 2021, where everyone could only see a negative future for the business 11 months ago. Seeking Alpha Article - Paul Franke, Coinbase Global, January 3rd, 2023 Of course, had you invested aggressively and bought Coinbase, an astounding +247% gain was your reward over less than one year. This increase has largely been a function of a dramatic jump in pricing for password-secured computer money, especially Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The leading crypto creation by market cap (and one of the first) has risen from the equivalent of US$16,000 to $37,000 in price, an advance of +125%. Seeking Alpha - Bitcoin-USD, Price Change, 12 Months The bad news for Coinbase shareholders is today I am getting nervous again. With a still uncertain regulatory environment for crypto trading, and many nations outlawing them altogether (like China), the business future remains quite murky for Coinbase. Overvaluation Problem - Again More worrisome, even with relative optimism by analysts now vs. a year ago regarding business growth prospects, COIN is not projected to earn any real income until 2027 (four years from now). If this proves true (or overly optimistic) the current $120 share price and $27 billion equity market value are not exactly a screaming buy for rational investors. Seeking Alpha Table - Coinbase, Analyst Consensus Estimates for 2023-25, Made November 26th, 2023 It's also very difficult to value a company long term, given large operating losses for income and very little free cash flow coming in the door. YCharts - Coinbase Global, Trailing 12-Month Operating Income and Free Cash Flow, 3 Years Perhaps the best way to decide if a new company without earnings has any value to shareholders is by comparing the share price to underlying sales. You will notice on the chart below, Coinbase during 2021 was one of the most expensive choices (20x) vs. financial exchanges, blockchain players, broker/dealers and the main U.S. money-center bank, using the P/S ratio. It then swung to the ""cheapest"" position in early 2023 (2x), and yet again Wall Street has swiftly re-rated COIN near the top of this peer group for attractiveness (10x). The question becomes, does Coinbase deserve such an extended valuation? YCharts - Coinbase vs. Major U.S. Financial Exchanges, Brokers, Banks - Price to Trailing Sales, 3 Years The problem is earnings are absent, and sales growth is estimated to be quite meager going forward. Is this really the kind of investment you want in your portfolio? All hat, no cattle? Usually, high valuations are matched against high growth rates. Seeking Alpha's computer ranking system gives Coinbase an ""F"" Valuation Grade , which may not capture how expensive the company really is given a major downturn in crypto pricing and trading interest during an approaching recession. Seeking Alpha Table - Coinbase Global, Valuation Grade, November 26th, 2023 Technical Chart Lacks Momentum Confirmation Another issue I have with Coinbase is its chart pattern. The share price upmove in November is not being confirmed by conventional momentum indicators of underlying strength. For an advance to be considered healthy, you want to find clear evidence of buying pressure in the trend and volume statistics. If bullish momentum does not exist, you can view any further advance as suspect, perhaps needing a period of consolidation and regrouping. COIN's $120 price high on Monday (November 27th, 2023) is not being supported by tons of buying. It may prove to be an over-excitement spike, where sellers step away for a week or two. Then, on the higher quote, they reappear to liquidate in large numbers. Specifically, I do not like the action in some of my favorite indicators. The Accumulation/Distribution Line , Negative Volume Index , and On Balance Volume figures all peaked in July (marked with blue circles). When we review the 18-month chart of daily price and volume trading changes, finding concrete bullish technical support for the latest price advance is not easy. Really, all three indicators have not performed well during the 2023 price jump, each well beneath the levels of August 2022. In the end, we may look back at this year's strong performance as nothing more than a retest of the 2021 all-time high period. StockCharts.com - Coinbase Global, 18 Months of Price & Volume Changes, Author Reference Points Final Thoughts Parsing through all the overvaluation data, I cannot find an honest reason to own/hold shares. If the global economy enters recession in 2024, many cryptocurrency owners may liquidate positions to pay bills and debts coming due if real estate and stock market wealth are also moving in reverse. Under this bearish macroeconomic scenario, Coinbase operating results could spill lower in dramatic fashion. If sales are falling and reported losses growing, why would you want to hold or buy one of the most overvalued assets in the financial trading/exchange sector? How could I be wrong, and COIN continue to enjoy impressive gains? I would say such a scenario requires a flight from other assets into cryptocurrencies. Some pundits/analysts believe this is entirely possible, as new-age investors give up on traditional stores of value (like precious metals) and investments in real estate and regular equities. I am not in this camp. In fact, I am very concerned a deep and prolonged recession could lead to a collapse in cryptos, especially if western governments want to track computer-generated currencies for regulation and taxation purposes. So, 2024 may be the year cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin witness a real ""stress test."" We may soon see if they will be a lasting addition to the world of financial assets/money, or something of a mania that fades into the history books. I am downgrading my 12-month rating outlook for Coinbase Global to Strong Sell . Thanks for reading. Please consider this article a first step in your due diligence process.

The quantity of LUNC tokens in circulation has decreased to 5.8 trillion due to the destruction of around 78.24 billion of them, which could put more pressure on the token’s price. The cryptocurrency industry frequently uses this process of token burning to control inflation and increase token value by lowering supply.

Furthermore, the increase happens a week after Terraform Labs allocated $10 million in assets among three different liquidity pools. As of writing, LUNC is trading at $0.00011. With a $513 million daily trading volume, LUNC’s market capitalization of $661 million places it as the 79th largest cryptocurrency asset. LUNC’s indicators are all in very positive positions, which is not surprising given that the coin has increased by more than 30% in a single day.

This surge implies that whales have finally made a comeback to the token, pilfering more of it and igniting a broader rally. Meanwhile, LUNC and USTC reported milestone price increases over the previous week, according to data from the crypto intelligence tracker Santiment. As a result of the two coins’ historic weekly gains, LUNC and USTC are now the top moving cryptocurrencies on Santiment’s tracker.

However, the merchant's identity would be disclosed to their bank when the payment occurs to help reduce tax evasion or illicit payments.  As jurisdictions around the world consider issuing digital versions of sovereign currencies, privacy has emerged as a chief public concern.  “Privacy is an important user requirement but it is the most difficult to solve. The difficulty lies in ensuring privacy protection technologically rather than just promising it, and at the same time ensuring that such a high level of protection cannot be abused,” Thomas Moser, alternate governing board member at the Swiss National Bank said in a press statement.

20837242,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562949,1701245148,XRP Price Set For 20% Leap In Coming Days: Crypto Analyst,"In a recent technical analysis published by crypto analyst Egrag, an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) formation has been identified on the XRP/USD chart, indicating a potential bullish reversal in the near term. The pattern, which has been forming over the last two weeks, suggests that XRP could be setting up for a significant price jump. XRP Price Poised For Imminent 20% Jump? The chart by Egrag showcases the XRP price action in a 4-hour time frame, where it has been trading within a descending channel (blue) since the beginning of November. A descending channel is typically considered a bearish pattern. However, last Wednesday, the XRP price broke out of the descending channel. While the breakout didn’t hold up and ended up being a fake-out, it paved the way for the emergence of the inverse H&S pattern which is now changing the momentum in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: XRP, BNB Among Altcoins Losing Correlation With Bitcoin: Data Technically, the inverse H&S pattern is distinguished by two smaller peaks (shoulders) on either side of a larger trough (head), which is evident from the chart’s annotations. The left shoulder formed around the $0.586 support level, with the head dipping as low as $0.574, before rising to form the right shoulder at $0.593. This pattern is indicative of a bearish trend losing momentum and a potential bullish reversal if the pattern completes. Egrag’s analysis points to key price levels to watch, with the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern sitting at approximately $0.6289. A decisive breakout above this resistance level could see XRP prices rally towards the $0.7000 mark, which aligns with the pattern’s predicted breakout target. Beyond this, the analyst’s target sits at $0.7311, which marked the beginning of the descending channel. A rally to this price level would represent a 20% increase from the current XRP price. Related Reading: Analyst Uses 5200% Impulse Against Bitcoin To Predict XRP Price Surge To $9.6 It is crucial to note that while the inverse H&S pattern suggests a bullish outcome, the validity of the pattern will only be confirmed upon a clear break and closure above the neckline. As always, while the technical setup is constructive for XRP bulls, market participants should consider various factors, including market sentiment, news flow, and broader market trends. In a bearish scenario where the inverse head and shoulders pattern is invalidated, the XRP price could move towards the trend line of the descending channel. In his chart, Egrag marks $0.5564 and $0.53 as crucial support levels for the XRP price where a reversal could take place. At press time, XRP traded at $0.61348. On the 1-day time frame, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.628 remains the key resistance level in the short-term.

Solana’s SOL tokens led gains among layer-1, or base, blockchains, jumping some 8% in the past 24 hours to reverse losses from the past week. Avalanche’s AVAX bumped 6.6%, while Cardano’s ADA and Tron’s TRX rose over 5%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based index that tracks the crypto market, rose over 2.5%.  Bitcoin momentum started to rise late Tuesday as Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller said recent data suggested a slowdown in the economy and continuing moderation in inflation showed current policies were in the “right spot.”  Waller also said that if inflation were to continue to decline, there's a good argument to be made for rate cuts within a few months.  Interest rate decisions have the tendency to move markets. Higher rates usually mean risk assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies take a hit as investors could take profits and invest in bonds.  Elsewhere, global bank Standard Chartered double-downed on its April forecast that bitcoin (BTC) would reach $100,000 by the end of 2024.

Breaking it down  Binance flagrantly violated U.S. law, allowing U.S. users on the platform despite telling the public otherwise, ignoring know-your-customer/anti-money laundering requirements and going out of its way to obfuscate both its location and its engagement with U.S. customers, the Department of Justice alleged last week.  We've known about these allegations for the last week, but if you were trying to get to a long holiday weekend or something, here's some links to catch you up: CoinDesk's article, last week's newsletter, the DOJ information document (not an indictment, importantly), a statement of facts Binance agreed to, the FinCEN consent order, the plea stuff and that's probably enough for now.  ""VIP users were an important part of [Binance's] business model, and a significant number were U.S. users,"" a court filing said. ""VIP users, including those within and outside the United States, accounted for an outsized percentage of Binance's revenue and of the trading volume on Binance.com.""  Later on, the filing added that Binance ""facilitated billions of dollars"" of transactions for customers without any know-your-customer/anti-money laundering protections, and so it moved funds for people in sanctioned jurisdictions.  ""During the relevant period, Defendant knew that U.S. law prohibited U.S. persons from conducting certain financial transactions with countries, groups, entities or persons sanctioned by the U.S. government,"" the filing said. ""Defendant also knew that it did not block transactions between users subject to U.S. sanctions and U.S. users and that its matching engine would necessarily cause such transactions.""  Prosecutors estimated that U.S. users transacted just under $900 million across more than 1 million transactions.  All this to say Binance will pay a lot of money and appoint some monitors to watch over its platform for the next few years. My colleague Daniel Kuhn analyzed Binance's finances – what we know of them, anyway – and concluded that on a purely dollar level, the exchange looks like it can weather the $4.3 billion fine, especially given it has a few years to pay it off.  The monitors are also an interesting detail. Binance agreed to appoint an independent monitor in its settlement with the DOJ, who will ""assess and monitor the company's compliance"" with the terms of its plea, which includes overseeing its various compliance programs. There's specific reviews scheduled over the coming months, where the monitor will assess and report on Binance's compliance policies to the company's leadership, as well as the DOJ's corporate enforcement and bank integrity units and the U.S. attorney's office for the Western District of Washington.  A separate agreement with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said Binance would also appoint a monitor who would work with the Treasury Department watchdog. This monitor should be appointed within the next month or so. While the consent order describes how a monitor will be appointed, it does not appear that the proposed names will be made public.  ""To ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor,"" a Treasury Department press release said.  While Binance shouldn't suffer greatly from paying the fines it owes, how its customers react to increased AML/KYC processes and the fact that Binance will make all of its books available to the U.S. government for review at the government's request is more of an open question. It may be a more difficult one to answer quickly. The exchange saw close to $1 billion flow out of its coffers after the settlement was announced, but its 24-hour trading volume seems to have survived largely intact, according to CoinGecko.  CZ is also in a bit of limbo, at least for the moment. Federal prosecutors want him to remain in the U.S. until his sentencing. His attorneys say he should be able to go back to the United Arab Emirates, where he, his wife and his children live (and where he's a citizen).  This argument pretty much seems to boil down to trust. Prosecutors don't seem to trust that CZ, if allowed to leave the country, will actually come back. For the moment, CZ is in the U.S., after the district judge overseeing the case ruled that he can't leave until there's a final decision.  But it's in the pages of the back-and-forth that the U.S. makes an obvious, yet still fascinating admission: CZ is paying what they think is a relatively small fine for the crimes they allege he is responsible for.  ""The government believes that the vast majority of that wealth is held overseas and Zhao is believed to have hundreds of millions of dollars in accessible cryptocurrency. Zhao could live on that wealth in the UAE indefinitely,"" the filing said.

20827262,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562928,1701223221,"Binance Compliance Officer Under Scrutiny For FTX, Gemini, And Sex Trafficker Associations","In a recent investigative report by the media outlet Unlimited Hangout, serious allegations were made against Noah Perlman, the chief compliance officer of Binance. The report highlights Perlman’s alleged ties to the collapse of FTX, the troubled Gemini exchange owned by the Winklevoss twins, and even convicted and deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. If the allegations made by the media outlet prove true, and Perlman is investigated by US authorities, Binance could find itself embroiled in another executive scandal following the departure of former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Associations With Epstein And Alleged Fraud Unlimited Hangout alleges that Perlman’s father, Itzhak Perlman, a renowned violinist, had flown on multiple occasions on a plane owned by Jeffrey Epstein. Itzhak Perlman also reportedly accompanied Epstein to Michigan’s Interlochen Center for the Arts, where Epstein later built a lodge for him, which was later described as a “lair to target girls.” While Noah Perlman served as a federal prosecutor for the Department of Justice’s Special Coordinator for Crimes against Children, these family connections to Epstein raise questions about his associations. After leaving the Department of Justice, Perlman joined Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange owned by the Winklevoss Twins, as the chief compliance officer. Although Perlman had left Gemini months before the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the exchange, he had been allegedly “heavily involved” in Gemini’s Earn program, which became the focus of the alleged $1.1 billion fraud. Related Reading: Analyst Thinks DOT Will Reclaim Former Glory With Polkadot 2.0 As reported by NewsBTC, the lawsuit alleges that certain individuals knew that the program’s partner, Genesis, was financially unstable and withdrew their funds before its collapse. Per the report, Perlman held the position of chief operating officer at the time, raising suspicions about his role in the alleged misconduct. Troubled Bank’s Links To Binance Officer And FTX Perlman’s involvement with Farmington State Bank, later renamed Moonstone, adds another layer of complexity to the alleged wrongdoing cited by Unlimited Hangout. According to the report, in 2019, Perlman was listed as a director of FBH Corp., the entity that took over the rural bank. Moonstone Bank later garnered attention when Alameda Research, linked to FTX, acquired an $11.5 million stake. Sam Bankman-Fried, the former chief of FTX, also reportedly invested $50 million in the bank. However, Moonstone Bank faced regulatory challenges, with the Federal Reserve initiating an enforcement action against it shortly before the Bank of Eastern Oregon acquired its deposits and assets. Overall, Perlman is at the center of serious allegations concerning his alleged connections with Jeffrey Epstein, the failed Earn program at Gemini, and Moonstone Bank. However, it is important to note that these allegations have not been substantiated by any investigations or official connections made by US authorities or other global agencies. Related Reading: Unlocking Bitcoin ETF Profits: Experts Reveals “Best” Trading Strategy The claims and allegations put forth by media news outlets require further response from Binance’s executives and investigation by relevant authorities. There has been no official statement from Perlman regarding these allegations. It remains to be seen how the exchange and Perlman himself will address these claims and provide clarity on the matter.

Analyst Predicts BTC Won’t Fall Below $35,000 Ever Again","Controversial Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model creator PlanB has recently made a bold prediction about Bitcoin (BTC) that’s captured the crypto community’s attention. Via his social media handle X, PlanB stated that Bitcoin’s price would never plummet below the $35,000 threshold again. PlanB supported his claim with a chart illustrating Bitcoin’s valuation trend about its intrinsic hash rate. According to PlanB, this relationship is a critical indicator of the digital currency’s enduring value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Defies Global Market Trends: Negative Correlation Hits Pre-Pandemic Levels Despite acknowledging potential black swan events or short-term market volatility, PlanB insists that based on the current fundamentals, particularly the cost of electricity ($/kWh) used in mining Bitcoin, the asset’s market value is “unlikely” to retract below the mentioned support level – $35,000. Mining And Market Arbitrage: A Key Factor The crux of PlanB’s argument lies in the unique arbitrage opportunity that exists between Bitcoin miners and everyday users. Miners, who invest heavily in electricity to mine the digital asset, and users, who typically purchase Bitcoin with fiat currency on exchanges, create a dynamic market environment. According to PlanB, this arbitrage might become even more pronounced with the advent of a potential launch of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the US. 🚨BREAKING: Bitcoin valuation based on difficulty (hashrate) increased to $35k yesterday. IMO this could mean that, apart from possible black swans or short term volatility, based on $/kWh-arbitrage fundamentals … BTC will never go below $35k ever again. pic.twitter.com/JPLkXieQAP — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) November 27, 2023 PlanB suggests that miners, equipped with specialized knowledge about the market and the actual cost of producing Bitcoin, might begin to demand a premium when selling the cryptocurrency. This shift could fundamentally alter the way Bitcoin is traded and its perceived value. The introduction of BTC spot ETFs, in particular, is expected to bring a new level of mainstream acceptance and investment into Bitcoin, potentially solidifying its price floor as predicted by PlanB. Bitcoin Hash Rate And Market Dynamics Delving deeper into the concept of Bitcoin’s hash rate, it’s essential to understand its role in securing the network and validating transactions. The hash rate basically measures the computational power being used to mine and process transactions on the blockchain. A higher hash rate indicates more robust security and efficiency in the network, often correlating with increased investor confidence and, consequently, a higher asset valuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Only Just Starting, According To This Metric PlanB’s analysis posits that Bitcoin’s valuation will follow suit as the hash rate continues to rise, driven by technological advancements and increased mining activities. This relationship forms the basis of his prediction that Bitcoin will maintain a strong market position, unlikely to fall below the $35,000 mark. Currently, BTC is trading above $37,000, marking an increase of over $2,000 from the support level PlanB mentioned. Specifically, at the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price stands at $37,605, reflecting a 2% rise in the last 24 hours.
