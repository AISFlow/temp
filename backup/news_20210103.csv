42385526,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27ch,1609711260,Crypto Long & Short: Looking Back on a Monumental Year,"The first Crypto Long & Short of 2021 has a different format: Instead of the usual article, I've asked some leading industry analysts – including Kaiko, IntoTheBlock, skew.com and Arcane Crypto – to share their favorite charts with you. The depth and quality of metrics available to market observers has grown by leaps and bounds this year, and the work of these analysts and others goes a long way toward helping investors to not only understand the crypto ecosystem better, but also to appreciate how different and fascinating the assets and their markets are. Click on the below links to find out more about these analysts' work and the data they offer.      (You can see more of Kaiko’s and Arcane Crypto's work in our Research Hub.)      Clara Medalie, Business Development and Strategy at Kaiko      The March market crash will go down in history as one of the steepest and most rapid sell-offs to ever sweep cryptocurrency markets. Over the course of an hour, bitcoin's price plummeted thousands of dollars and order book liquidity all but evaporated. This chart shows the sum of all bids and asks placed on Coinbase's BTC-USD order book before, during and after the first price crash. We can observe that when the crash began around 10:30am, the quantity of orders surrounding the midprice plummeted, forcing a liquidity crisis that perpetuated the steep fall in price.      This chart is one of my favorites because it demonstrates the important role that market makers play in creating and maintaining liquidity in cryptocurrency markets. Ultimately, the March crash proved that the price of an asset is often less a reflection of the “true value at a point in time assigned through the process of market-based price discovery” and more a product of relentless feedback loops triggered by automatic liquidations and decimated order book depth. As cryptocurrency markets mature and order book liquidity improves, we can expect the magnitude and frequency of such price crashes to decrease.      Lucas Outumuro, senior analyst at IntoTheBlock      IntoTheBlock categorizes on-chain transfers of over $100,000 as ""large transactions."" The aggregate volume in large transactions serves as a proxy to institutional investors’ and high net worth individuals’ transaction activity.      Large transaction volume for Bitcoin has grown considerably in 2020 along with institutional interest. Comparing the average large transaction volume on the Bitcoin blockchain for December 2020 relative to December 2019, we observe it has more than quadrupled from an average of $7 billion per day to over $30 billion.      Emmanuel Goh, CEO of skew.com      In 2020, institutions finally embraced bitcoin but not always in the way one would expect. For instance, sophisticated investors such as hedge funds have been looking at capturing spreads by looking at the inefficiencies of this nascent market. This has translated in particular to leveraged funds positioning of CME bitcoin futures making new record shorts almost on a weekly basis in the last quarter of 2020.      Bendik Norheim Schei, head of research at Arcane Crypto      The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector saw moderate adoption during the first half of the year, with lending protocols dominating the space. At the time, the total value locked in DeFi was relatively stable, for the most part ranging between $700 million and $1 billion. Then, on June 16, Compound launched its governance token. The interest in the sector then exploded (quite literally), as yield farming attracted many new participants into the space.    The total value locked in DeFi has increased from $670 million to $14.5B in 2020, a growth of 2100%.  By December, 1 million unique addresses were affiliated with DeFi, a 10x growth from January. Both lending platforms and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have seen particularly strong growth this year, while derivatives platforms have seen a more moderate (albeit strong) growth.    2021 prediction: DeFi derivatives platforms will see a more substantial growth, with stricter regulations on the centralized derivatives market leading traders to alternative markets.    Anyone know what's going on yet?    Instead of trying to recap the annual or even the weekly performance in macro markets (because many will have done that in much more depth and with more perspective than I could), I’ll leave you with an awesome summary overheard coming from the mouth of a particularly observant kid, when asked how he would sum up 2020:      “It’s like when you have to cross the road, and you carefully look to the right and then to the left, and then you get run over by a submarine.”      I will, however, share with you our usual chart of relative performances, because, well …      For an insightful rundown of bitcoin market developments in 2020, check out my colleague Bradley Keoun’s piece.    CHAIN LINKS    Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital has already invested $182 million in bitcoin. TAKEAWAY: The bitcoin fund’s brochure lists increasing adoption, lower risk, low interest rates and “unprecedented money printing” as some of the main reasons for bitcoin’s growing respectability. A quote from the brochure: “Bitcoin is digital gold. It is better at being gold than gold.”      BlackRock is seeking to hire a vice president to help build demand for the company’s crypto-related offerings. TAKEAWAY: The gotcha here is that BlackRock is planning crypto products! That would definitely signal mainstream institutional acceptance – it’s unlikely that BlackRock would take this step unless it had already seen some demand.      Fund manager VanEck has submitted an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. TAKEAWAY: VanEck has previously and unsuccessfully proposed exchange-traded funds, withdrawing its most recent application in September 2019. This latest attempt signals that the firm believes the environment is more favorable now than in the recent past, and we are likely to see other ETF managers submit further proposals in the coming months.      Earlier this week, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was briefly the largest bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, which reached $1.66 billion. TAKEAWAY: This is, in my view, the clearest signal that institutional interest in bitcoin is growing. At the beginning of 2020, the CME bitcoin futures open interest ranked fifth, well behind BitMEX, OKEx and Huobi. The daily volumes in the CME’s bitcoin futures, however, are well below the exchange’s Asian counterparts, which implies less trading and more strategic positioning than in crypto derivative exchanges outside the U.S.      Gazpromneft, the oil subsidiary of Russia’s natural gas giant Gazprom, has opened a venue for cryptocurrency mining on one of its oil drilling sites in Siberia. TAKEAWAY: So many threads to pull on here: 1) oil and gas producers seeing cryptocurrency mining as a diversification source; 2) the geographical spread of crypto mining activity; 3) Gazprom is a state-owned enterprise, getting involved (albeit indirectly) in cryptocurrency mining.      Canadian augmented reality (AR) company NexTech AR (NTAR) plans to use its treasury funds to buy $2 million worth of bitcoin for “capital diversification.” TAKEAWAY: This is not as big a bet as MicroStrategy (MSTR) has made this year, since this amount is only approximately 15% of the available cash on hand at the end of Q3. The firm’s CEO said that he sees bitcoin as having more long-term appreciation potential than simply holding cash. We will most likely see more announcements like this over the coming months.      National Football League player Russell Okung will get half of his $13 million annual salary in bitcoin, via crypto startup Zap, whose Strike product enables traditional paychecks to be converted to bitcoin. TAKEAWAY: Apart from the high-profile publicity this gives bitcoin (and we are likely to see more athletes making crypto-related announcements over the coming months), it is also a sign of the widening breadth of products for a market beyond institutions. According to Zap’s CEO, Strike can now be used as a checking account through partnerships with two yet-to-be-named banks. What’s more, Okung’s advocacy for bitcoin is not news – he launched the bitcoinis project which writes and hosts meetups about cryptocurrency – so we can expect to see more buzz-generating public comments next year.      For those of us working in the industry, it’s been fun in a smug sort of way watching the number of declarations of bitcoin’s failure and imminent death. The website 99bitcoins.com has tracked bitcoin ""obituaries,"" and now shows that cynics are flagging. TAKEAWAY: This is understandable since bitcoin has weathered a few winters and market slumps. It’s also a pity, since an overlooked benefit of criticism is that it forces us to improve our explanations. There is still a lot of education to do; but it seems that there is now more career risk in dissing bitcoin than in suggesting that clients invest.      The Ripple suit: The list of crypto platforms dropping XRP in the light of the SEC’s suit continues to grow, with Coinbase, Binance US, Genesis, OKCoin, Crypto.com and eToro USA joining the ranks.

42385520,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27V9,1609697417,DOGE's Gone Wild! Meme Coin Soars After Adult Star Says She's a HODLer,"The price of dogecoin (DOGE) has more than doubled since the start of the new year after an adult star tweeted she has been a HODler, a price move that could stoke concerns the recent surge in crypto prices is fueling irrational speculation.    ""Been HODLing my $Doge since 2014. MUCH PATIENCE. TO THE MOON,"" tweeted Angela White on Friday night.  That apparently was enough to get some of White's 1.3 million followers to go out and get DOGE of their own. The price of the Shiba Inu meme-based cryptocurrency rose as much as 203% in three days to year to reach a peak at $0.014 Sunday, before settling down to $0.011.  At that level, it is up 11.81% in the last 24 hours, and 134% thus far in 2021.  DOGE was literally created as a joke in 2013 and one of its own founders has become a frequent critic of the crypto community. To bears, a price surge in a cryptocurrency that was never intended to serve a financial function could be a sign a top is near in the broader crypto rally. In recent days, various ""altcoins"" have posted sharp gains on the heels of a spectacular two-week performance for bitcoin.  This spike is reminiscent of DOGE's rise last summer as videos on TikTok encouraged users to invest in the cryptocurrency, with one possible difference:  The chart below shows DOGE's performance over the last week with the red circle indicating the time White's tweet was sent. Given the coin started gaining ground shortly before the tweet really got things going, it's possible that White's decision to declare herself a DOGE lover simply added fuel to a fire that had already been struck by the broader crypto market's state of exuberance.

42385517,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27ML,1609688165,It's Genesis Block Day. Do You Know Where Your Bitcoin Keys Are?,"Today is Bitcoin Day, the anniversary of the Genesis Block that marked the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain in 2009. This year, with the price of bitcoin shooting for the moon, Bitcoiners have more reason to celebrate – and more reason to assert their sovereignty over their private keys.    See also: Bitcoin Blasts Past $34K for First Time, Less Than 24 Hours After Blowing Through $30K    An annual event first initiated by Trace Mayer, Proof of Keys is an informal celebration that aims to remind bitcoiners that monetary sovereignty is a fundamental part of Bitcoin’s ethos. It lies at the very heart of the familiar Bitcoiner mantra, “not your keys, not your coin.” In other words, if you don’t control the private keys to your bitcoin, you don’t really own the coin.      The saying is a reminder that Bitcoin was built to give users complete control over their finances. It’s also a reminder of the potential consequences of trusting your bitcoin keys to a third party (like losing your funds in an exchange hack).    See also: How to Store Your Bitcoin  Establishing monetary sovereignty    “Anyone who doesn’t want you to hold your own private keys – they’re your monetary enemy. They don’t want you to be free and independent with your money,” Mayer said in the lead-up to 2019's inaugural event. “That’s just the way it is.”      The implications of being reliant on others to process, exchange and hold your cryptocurrencies aren’t immaterial. They hold acute consequences and compromises of your privacy, and will limit how you interact with your own money.      The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) gathers extensive personal information on millions of people’s financial transactions, all provided by financial institutions, even when those people have not committed any crime.      This year, taking custody of your keys by moving them to a personal wallet takes on an added level of significance. FinCEN has proposed a plan that will force exchanges to comply with new know-your-customer (KYC) requirements when users try to transfer their funds to a personal wallet. Such a requirement, applicable to any transferred amount over $3,000 in value, threatens to undermine cryptocurrencies' early promise of privacy and self-sovereignty. (Note: FinCEN is accepting comments from the public on this issue only until Jan. 4, 2021).    See also: US Floats Long-Dreaded Plan to Make Crypto Exchanges Identify Personal Wallets    Add to this the recent delisting of privacy coins by many exchanges, aforementioned exchange hacks showing no signs of stopping and other snafus like absent exchange keyholders inadvertently freezing transactions. Assuming control of your own private keys and becoming the first and last line of control when it comes to your crypto is even more imperative.      The most basic way to exercise your monetary sovereignty is to hold your private keys in your own non-custodial bitcoin wallet. This means taking any bitcoin you own out of exchanges and custodial wallets and transferring the keys to a wallet you control.    Proof of Keys    ""Proof of Keys"" takes the notion of self-sovereignty even further by adding the adage, “Not your node; not your rules.” The point here is that it is equally important to withdraw your keys to a bitcoin node that you are running. This way, you can perform your own validation yourself, without having to trust other people’s nodes to prove that your keys are your own.    See also: Becoming Self-Sovereign: How to Set Up a Bitcoin Node, With Lightning    Participants in Proof of Keys usually pledge to take possession of any private keys on or before Jan. 3. On Twitter, this pledge is denoted publicly by the addition of series of symbols to their user name or profile: [Jan/3➞₿🔑∎] The date, arrow, Bitcoin unicode and key represent their intent to hold their keys. The block signals that they have completed the verification process.    Casa’s KeyFest    Self-custodying your keys can be a tricky proposition for the uninitiated – and even for some who have been holding bitcoin for a long time.

42385511,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27IZ,1609686027,This Is What Global Open-Source Money Seems Like,"Ludwig Wittgenstein once asked a friend, “Tell me, why do people say it is more natural to think that the Sun rotates around the Earth than that the Earth is rotating?” The friend said, “Well, obviously, because it just seems like the Sun is going around the Earth.” Wittgenstein replied, “Well, what would it seem likeif it did seem likethe Earth were rotating?”      As bitcoin begins its quadrennial bull run, we must brace ourselves for the wider world’s sudden and ill-informed interest. A great many newcomers will arrive with an open mind – as we all did once – but so, too, will many representatives of the incumbents emerge to insist that what we can see with our very own eyes isn’t actually happening because, according to their theory, it can’t.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Allen Farrington writes at Quillette, Areo and Merion West, as well as extensively on Medium. His collected writings can be found here. He lives in Edinburgh. This is a condensed version of a longer essay here.    Bitcoin can’t be a store of value because it has no intrinsic value. It can’t be a unit of account because it is too volatile. It can’t be a medium of exchange because it is not widely used to price goods and services. These are the three properties of money. Therefore, bitcoin can’t be money. But bitcoin has no other basis for being valued, therefore it is valueless. QED.      I call this argument, semantics therefore reality. What could possibly falsify this? It is, at root, a claim about the material world; about what will, or in this case won’t, happen in real life. And yet it looks rather like it relies entirely on the meanings of words. In discussing dollarization in Ecuador – the instructive process of an “official” money being spontaneously replaced by a simpler superior money – Larry White says of those who deny by definition that such a thing can even happen that they, “are only looking at the blackboard and not at what is happening outside the window.” This is a curious approach to understanding novel phenomena that, in general, I would not recommend. Reality doesn’t care how you describe it.      But there is also a softer, slipperier, more agnostic form of the semantic theory that acknowledges that something is happening: that bitcoin is not nothing, but that it surely cannot be money because it is so dissimilar to the standard (semantic) conception of what money should be and how it should behave that the proposition is too uncomfortable to accept. It certainly seems like a network of some kind: It is global, digital, sound, open and programmable. And it has undeniably increased in value from a point in the past when it was worth nothing at all. But does this distinguish it from a regular old financial bubble? Can “money” be reconciled with bubble-like behavior? And is bitcoin’s digital nature such a plus? Doesn’t the Internet enable a speed and potency of virality that is arguably finely tuned to inflate a bubble in anything deemed openly, programmably digital? Bitcoin may be something – maybe the “blockchain technology” it runs on? – but, obviously, it just seems like bitcoin isn’t money.      Wittgenstein would be most unimpressed. He would likely ask, ""What would it seem like if it did seem like a global, digital, sound, open, programmable money was monetizing from absolute zero?""      Let us ask that, too.      See also: Allen Farrington - Spiritual Reflections on the Bitcoin Halving      The semantic theory is alarmingly static. This stasis is rooted in its semantic chicanery: many languages have different verbs to distinguish between “being” as in having some property intrinsically or circumstantially, such as ser and estar, respectively, in Spanish. English does not. I am male just as I am hungry. But in which sense is bitcoin volatile? Is it intrinsically volatile or is it volatile at some moment, in some circumstances, relative to some standard? Are goods and services somehow fundamentally resistant to being priced in bitcoin? What happens if you try to do so? Is it like dividing by zero?      Imagine if all respectable business knowledge had been derived from studying large, established companies because there had never been a startup in living memory. If a startup then came along, people might well say, “That’s not a business because it doesn’t make a profit,” or, “That’s not a business because it doesn’t have a defined business plan.” Clearly, this would be ill-advised. That is not to say that their models and definitions would be perfectly wrong instead of perfectly right, but rather that things are not so binary. Reality is messy and it is reality we should care about, not our theories of reality that, it turns out, have never really been tested.      I propose we should reject the arrogance of knowing that a new money cannot emerge because reality follows from our semantics.    What it would seem like    So what would it seem like? It would depend on the relative merits of the challenger and the incumbent, but also on how the perceptions of these merits spread, how perceptions of these perceptions spread, and so on. As the opportunity cost is absolute, the challenger money cannot merely be dabbled in, like a novel social network, but must be sincerely believed. Hence the challenger’s emergence may for a time depend on how individuals in the network think about money itself …      An adherent of the semantic theory would dismiss the challenger out of hand. If it isn’t acting as a medium of exchange and a unit of account then it won’t acquire the network effects to ever do so, meaning it won’t store value either and it can’t be money. QED.      But a more sophisticated observer might be less interested in definitions and look to the circumstances of competition between the two in real life. She would realize money has value on the basis of economic uncertainty, and that the greater the uncertainty we have around its operation, the less useful it becomes; that the demand for certainty it reciprocally fulfills means its value is primarily derived from perceived utility in exchange in the future rather than in the present; that it should support healthy and stable capital formation and that its mechanism should trustworthily capture true scarcity without dilution.    Reality doesn’t care how you describe it.    Turning to the challenger, she might be put off by the lack of immediate utility and the uncertainty this unfavorably invites. Nonetheless, she might recognize the value of the essential trustworthiness of its mechanism, and its transparent and limited dilution as providing a useful future certainty that respects the time and energy it aims to preserve. She might be encouraged by its prospects for healthy capital formation and the early signs of such capital formation taking place, and notice that the perception of its utility is spreading, steadily self-perpetuating the size and strength of its network.      As for the incumbent, she might worry its highly dilutive mechanism could not be trusted at all; that the capital formation it supports is toxic and unstable; that its overall operation is highly uncertain and that, as this perception seems to be spreading, its long-term utility and the size of its network is in increasingly serious question.      She might reason that, like Esperanto, its elaborate design may make it pleasing to its designers yet fragile and encumbered in the real world, whereas natural languages and natural moneys emerge and evolve to fulfill a decentralized demand. They suit a coarse reality, not a clean semantics. That these designers seem to have no conception of the importance to money of time, uncertainty, knowledge and capital might make her more nervous still about the likely quality of their design.      But regardless of her own appreciation of the merits, our observer cannot escape that she will also need to pre-empt others’ realization of the merits, and their appreciation of others’ realizations of the merits and so on. The challenger money’s success will be subject to precisely the uncertainty that generates its potential utility. This is not just a trade-off in the minds of economic actors, but a likely source of dynamic instability.      This is all to say that if it did seem like a new money was emerging, it would likely seem extremely volatile, irrational and unpredictable. The individual’s perspective tells us nothing. It possibly tells us less than nothing because it might seem informative as a snapshot of the dynamics of the network as a whole. It might seem like this volatility, irrationality and unpredictability destroys the challenger’s utility as money. But his individual perception is irrelevant to the whole. If it is acted on, by an individual, it affects the whole in volatile, irrational, unpredictable ways, and loops back around to affect his later perception.      If it did seem like a new money was emerging, I propose it would seem more like it were tracking an evolving and messy narrative than obeying a fixed and clean equation. It would be slow and it would be sporadic. It would not be the smooth exponential of a hot new social network, because the nature of its “network effects” would frankly be far more complex. It would be, in essence, the erratic and ever-changing spread of a contrarian belief about the nature of money itself.      If it did seem like a global, digital, sound, open-source, programmable money was monetizing from absolute zero, I guess it would seem a lot like this.

42385519,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB27Tt,1609678833,The Rise of Layer 2s Spells End for Altcoins,"Phase 1 of the Bitcoin journey is complete. Over the past 10 years we have seen the Bitcoin network rebuff questions as to whether it would survive as a concept. Today, we see the bitcoin cryptocurrency gaining monetary premium as prominent institutional investors identify it as the ultimate inflation hedge. As we transition into 2021, observers are turning their attention to what a financial market built around the world’s first cryptocurrency will end up looking like.      The talk of the town over the past year has been focused on the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) for digital assets and financial smart contracts, protocols and applications built on Ethereum. A development with equally promising potential to shake up crypto markets are layer 2 technologies, the overlaying network of services that expand on a blockchain's capabilities.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Edan Yago is a neuroscientist and entrepreneur who dropped everything nine years ago to focus on Bitcoin. He has most recently contributed to bitcoin-native DeFi platform Sovryn. Previously, Yago founded Cement DAO and Epiphyte to provide global remittance with bitcoin.    This year has seen the rollout of the first layer 2 projects. In fact, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin himself has stated that layer 2 is now the roadmap for Ethereum, and by extension other blockchains, too. This means that other scaling solutions, or ways to improve a blockchain’s functionality such as tokens – application specific bits of code – could become obsolete.      Will the success of layer 2 developments mean the demise of altcoins?    2020: The high watermark for altcoins    In the beginning there was only Bitcoin, and it did something quite remarkable – it created value out of nowhere. The Bitcoin blockchain had been designed to create only one thing – bitcoin. As others jumped onto this alchemist bandwagon, a multitude of alternative coins were created that were meant to function in a specific application like health care, identity or gaming. In reality, almost all of these projects ended up going nowhere.      There was one notable exception. Ethereum, and its provision of smart contracts provided real functionality even if the results of its open system are dubious. Its native currency, ether, is the second-most popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin and it is rapidly growing. Ethereum's first “killer app” was the initial coin offering, a way to create more tokens.      However, with the rise of DeFi in 2020 Ethereum’s technological flaws have come into relief.      Ethereum is notorious for being incredibly slow, expensive to use and inefficient to the point where it is sometimes difficult to even get a transaction in. Progress has been frustratingly slow on Ethereum 2.0, the blockchain upgrade designed to address these issues. As a result, Ethereum developers in 2020 turned to layer 2.    Arise, layer 2    This year, the technologies around layer 2 have matured dramatically. On Ethereum, this has taken the form of DeFi projects being built on rollups (off-chain aggregations of transactions inside an Ethereum smart contract) consisting of both Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge proofs or ZK-Rollups. When performing transactions on a rollup, the only confirmations made on Ethereum are in aggregate, meaning that for the vast majority of transactions Ethereum’s native currency doesn’t need to be involved at all. Such a move significantly alters the importance of the underlying chain.      On Bitcoin, DeFi applications are being rolled out on Lightning network and sidechains such as RSK. 2020 was also the year that interchain solutions such as Polkadot, NEAR and Cosmos went live, effectively as layer 2 solutions for Bitcoin and Ethereum connected via “blockchain bridges.” For instance, Sovryn, a decentralized bitcoin trading and lending platform, takes advantage of Bitcoin layer 2 technology while deploying a bridge to the Ethereum ecosystem. Keeping its native currency as bitcoin and giving primacy to stablecoins results in a solution that is faster, cheaper, more secure and easy to use. What this means is that the primacy of the “chain” is diminishing fast.    Fragmentation    Until now the success of a blockchain lay with the number of people willing to believe in its mission. Buying into an initial coin offering or a token was similar to betting on that particular chain succeeding against competitors in a crowded marketplace.      Layer 2 solutions represent a fragmentation of the chain-first approach. Because there are so many layer 2 methods and systems, and no clear way for the ecosystem to coalesce around any one of them, the fragmentation we have seen this year will worsen. While layer 1 systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum have built-in interoperable standards, layer 2 does not. The implication is that the network effect will no longer be in the chain but in the assets. Look at bitcoin and tether in 2020. Both have migrated massive value across chains because the tokens themselves are the focal point, not the chains.    In face layer 1 of irrelevancy, these altcoins will by nature lose their justification to exist.    As fragmentation accelerates, exchanging value will increasingly rely on interoperable or “cross-communication” solutions. The various different rollups will eventually need to subscribe to a common set of standards, and those standards will be the tokens or assets, rather than the chains. In this new world, altcoins will be at a severe disadvantage when up against the likes of bitcoin and stablecoins. This is because up until now altcoins have been based on the promise of a chain with unique properties. Their existence has been predicated on the idea that they would be the native currency for a chain that would gain in importance.      In other words, the value of these currencies is derived purely from the fact they are the “native currency” of a chain with unique features. In face of layer 1 irrelevancy, these altcoins will by nature lose their justification to exist. Monetary premia will accrue instead to the things to which monetary premia traditionally accrues, which is broad acceptance and deep liquidity.      This trend towards irrelevance will include ETH. People have assumed ETH as an altcoin should be valuable, because Ethereum is popular. But something strange has happened on Ethereum in that there is as much value on the Ethereum chain in the form of bitcoin, stablecoins and other tokens, as in ether.      See also: Ethereum Launches Own ‘Ether’ Coin, With Millions Already Sold      The dollars and bitcoin on the Ethereum chain effectively provide the ability to transfer value without the need for ETH. Smart contracts can easily be ported to a different chain when transferring tokens over on a bridge (which is what happens whether you’re moving to RSK, Polkadot or a rollup). What we will begin to see is the breakup of the Ethereum ecosystem in a world where two notably bigger currencies, dollars and bitcoin, are accepted and liquid forms of value transfer. The primacy of ETH is unclear, it’s future uncertain.    What's coming    Looking forward, it is expected that fees on Ethereum will very soon become so high that new and current users alike will be pushed out. Some of them will abandon DeFi and self-sovereignty altogether and go to exchanges. Some will migrate to layer 2 in the form of rollups. And some will take advantage of the interoperability provided by “bridges” via RSK, Polkadot or Cosmos.      The fragmentation of the smart contract space is expected imminently. Instead of consolidating around the different base layer blockchains, a consolidation will occur around assets.      Tokens will flourish more than ever, but the nature of these tokens will change. Rather than trying to capture a monetary premia, tokens will represent other types of asset classes such as equity and debt in the form of crypto bonds and derivatives.      See also: Edan Yago – Forget Ethereum, DeFi Is Being Built on Bitcoin      What we're going to realize in 2021 is that the decentralized monetary system is effectively represented only by bitcoin and stablecoins. That's it – they've won that game. Now that the game is over the next challenge is going to be the decentralization of the financial layer, and the creation of financial tokens will play an important part in that. For bitcoin, we are at the end of the beginning.      No longer a proto-money, bitcoin is becoming the reserve currency of the future of finance. For altcoins we are at the beginning of the end.

After breaking $600 for the first time since May 2018 in November 2020, it broke $700 for the first time since that same month in 2018 on Dec. 27, 2020, and has now notched $800 and $900 in the same morning.  While bitcoin's surge to start the new year was one for the books, its rise has stalled in recent hours and ether has risen dramatically against the leading cryptocurrency during that time. The price of one ether in bitcoin terms is now close to 0.03, the highest it has been in nearly a month. Earlier on Sunday, it was just 0.02309 on Coinbase. That’s a rally of about 30% in just 15 hours.  Ether volumes on the eight exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20 have been substantially higher over the past month. As of Saturday, the seven-day average of total volume for ether trades on those exchanges was $3.3 billion, according to data from CryptoCompare. One month prior, it was $1.5 billion.

42424633,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy3NcJh,1609664764,"Bitcoin Blasts Past $34K for First Time, Less Than 24 Hours After Blowing Through $30K","Another day, another $1,000-plus increase in bitcoin's price, bringing the leading cryptocurrency's combined gains this new year to about $5,000.    The price of bitcoin surged past $34,000 for the first time ever early Sunday morning Eastern time, extending a record-setting holiday rally and adding an immediate exclamation point to the Bitcoin Network's 12-year anniversary.  Once the price of the leading cryptocurrency crossed the $30,000 mark for the first time Saturday – something it had struggled to do for the previous couple of days – it seemed all resistance vanished, rising more than $3,000 in about seven hours and reaching a new all-time high of $33,136.92, before settling down to fluctuate between $30,000 to $33,000.  ""Bitcoin makes TSLA [Tesla] look like it is standing still,"" tweeted Jim Bianco, well-known macro strategist, when the cryptocurrency broke $30,000.  Then, Saturday evening, bitcoin resumed its climb, setting a new all-time high of $34,544.94 shortly into Day 3 of the new year, before giving back some gains, recently trading at $34,295.11, up 15.09% in the last 24 hours.  It's a wild start to 2021 and follows a landmark year in which the cryptocurrency rose more than 300%, with an almost 50% gain in December alone. On Nov. 30, bitcoin breached a nearly three-year-old high of $19,793. By the close of Dec. 31, the cryptocurrency had risen about $10,000.  Into the third day of 2021, the price of bitcoin has risen about $5,000, bringing its year-to-date return to about 12%.  Propelling the record-setting run is a growing narrative that bitcoin represents a form of ""digital gold,"" and bringing with it a flood of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency. Among them: Anthony Scaramucci’s Skybridge Capital ($182 million in December); insurance giant MassMutual ($100 million in December); and Guggenheim Investments (up to 10% of its $5 billion macro fund).  ""Bitcoin's price is being driven by institutional money and there is not enough supply,"" Laurent Kssis, managing director at 21Shares, told CoinDesk. ""The number of family offices asking to invest in our [exchange-traded product] is just staggering. I've never seen this before. In 2017 it was just retail knocking at the door. Now it's only institutional.""  Kssis' statements are buttressed by the fact that the number of whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – rose to a new record high of 1,994 this past Wednesday.  The metric increased by over 16% in 2020 and 7.3% in Q4 alone.  ""The final land grab has started, and by this time next year, accumulating >1,000 bitcoin will be nearly impossible for most people,"" Jehan Chu, CEO at Hong Kong-based trading firm Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk.  HODLers also have the U.S. Federal Reserve to thank for the cryptocurrency's rise, as it, along with other central banks, has been printing money with abandon, trying to stave off the worst economic effects of the pandemic. This is viewed by many as a potential catalyst for inflation and bad for the U.S. dollar, both of which could be positive for bitcoin.  ""Many corporations are parking [U.S. dollars] in BTC because they are losing money in conventional banking, so it makes total sense,"" 21Shares' Kssis said.  Growing global macro uncertainty may also be playing a factor in the recent surge. A peaceful transition of power in the U.S. is no longer the ironclad guarantee it used to be as 11 Republican senators say they'll vote to reject the presidential electors from certain states. While it's still almost certain President-elect Joe Biden will assume office later this month, the need for a qualifier is a new event.  That, plus a mutated strain of COVID-19, a lagging world economy and concerns over the effects of the now-completed Brexit may not be helping the zeitgeist but could be aiding bitcoin, which some see as insurance against global chaos.  With a market value now of over $638.00 billion, bitcoin is more valuable than all but nine publicly traded companies, sitting between Alibaba at $648.3 billion and Berkshire Hathaway at $543.7 billion.  Bitcoin enthusiasts will likely find some joy in that last bit, an event that occurred last week, as Berkshire's CEO, legendary investor Warren Buffett, once famously derided bitcoin as ""probably rat poison squared.""  With today's surge, the cryptocurrency again has resumed its march up the ranks of the world's most valuable currencies, again overtaking the Mexican peso, which it had briefly surpassed Saturday, to move into 16th place, behind the Russian ruble.
