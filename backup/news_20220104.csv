42375567,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw99gb,1641334451,CoinDesk Joins Court Case Seeking Access to NYAG Tether Documents,"CoinDesk has joined a legal proceeding between the New York Attorney General’s office (NYAG) and Tether and its parent company as part of the news organization’s effort to shed light on the reserves backing $78.4 billion of stablecoins.  Tether, together with iFinex, which owns Tether and cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, petitioned the New York State Supreme Court in August to block the NYAG from providing CoinDesk with documents detailing the reserves. CoinDesk is now a party to the case because it has a stake in the outcome – and the publication is arguing that the investing public does too.  “The public interest in disclosure of the requested information far outweighs any private interest [Tether] might have,” CoinDesk said in a memorandum filed with the court Jan. 4.  Neither Tether nor the NYAG objected to CoinDesk intervening in the case, according to a Dec. 20 filing signed by lawyers for all three parties. An order permitting the intervention signed by Judge Laurence L. Love was posted two days later.  In June 2021, CoinDesk filed a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request with NYAG asking for documents obtained during the office’s investigation of Tether and Bitfinex, which the companies had settled earlier that year for $18.5 million  The FOIL request also asked for a copy of Tether’s submission to the NYAG in May 2021, when the stablecoin issuer published a breakdown of its reserves for the first time.  This breakdown was identical to what Tether sent the NYAG’s office in accordance with a February settlement, Tether General Counsel Stuart Hoegner said at the time.  The NYAG’s FOIL officer initially rejected CoinDesk’s FOIL request. The news organization appealed, and the appeals officer reversed the decision. In its petition, Tether argued that the exact composition of its reserves is a competitive trade secret and revealing this information would hurt its business.  Assistant Attorney General James B. Cooney filed to dismiss Tether’s petition on Dec. 6.  A Tether spokesperson did not return a request for comment, but in a public statement published three days after CoinDesk’s filing, Tether said, “CoinDesk has sought to intervene in this proceeding in an effort to re-write the agreement between the New York Attorney General’s Office (OAG) and Tether and Bitfinex.”  “It is worth noting that CoinDesk and Circle, the issuer of USDC and a Tether competitor, share an investor: Digital Currency Group. CoinDesk’s coverage of its legal papers does not alert readers to this glaring conflict of interest. Weaponizing the media does a disservice to the ecosystem,” the stablecoin issuer claimed. (All CoinDesk articles automatically include a standard disclosure about its ownership.)  Public interest or trade secret?  Chiefly, CoinDesk argued in court papers that disclosing what, specifically, is backing the USDT stablecoin issued by Tether is in the public interest, and therefore should not qualify as a trade secret. Tether itself claimed it had proactively made the decision to publicize its reserve breakdown when announcing its settlement with the NYAG.  The filings were signed by the news organization’s chief content officer, Michael Casey, and submitted to the court by Lacy H. Koonce III and Olivia Hayes Franklin, attorneys at Klaris Law PLLC. They argued that “the requested information does not fall into any FOIL Exemption.”  CoinDesk’s attorneys submitted an expert’s affirmation to explain why Tether’s documents should be made public.  “In my opinion disclosing the information relating to USDT’s backing assets would allow its users and the public to properly assess the claims to stability Tether makes and would be beneficial for the functioning of the market,” wrote Robleh Ali, general manager of Wadagso Inc., a technology company focusing on digital currency and associated market infrastructure. “Tether’s claim of a secret investment strategy that cannot be disclosed to users does not conform to USDT’s purported status as a stable asset supporting the functioning of the market and is more appropriate to a hedge fund – a comparison explicitly made. USDT can either be an exotic investment with a secret investment strategy to match or a stablecoin – it cannot be both.”  Ali criticized Tether’s likening itself to Ray Dalio’s hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, in previous filings with the court.  “[T]here is a fundamental difference between the two,” he wrote. Bridgewater “holds itself out as an investment firm designed to produce returns for its investors, not as a stable asset to facilitate trading elsewhere.”  (Also, Bridgewater lists some of its public equity holdings and their value in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.)  Also submitted was an affidavit, signed by the site’s executive editor, Marc Hochstein, in support of CoinDesk’s answer to the Tether petition.  Hochstein noted that New York Attorney General Letitia James said in her press release announcing the settlement that “Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines” and “Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie.”  Tether has until Feb. 4 to file a response to CoinDesk’s arguments. The court is scheduled to receive the parties’ arguments on Feb. 7.

42375580,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw99yD,1641331409,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Gains May Be Limited in January, Altcoins Outperform","Bitcoin (BTC) was roughly flat over the past 24 hours as trading volume continued to decline.  Still, some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperformed BTC on Tuesday. Internet Computer’s ICP token was up about 20% over the past 24 hours, and Chainlink’s LINK token was up about 4% over the same period.  Meanwhile, technical indicators suggest a brief price bounce in BTC could occur if buyers are able to defend a daily close above $47,000.  Some traders appear to be optimistic as leverage as open interest in the BTC perpetual futures market, a type of crypto derivative trading product, increased above November highs.  “The boring market over the last month seems to have attracted traders back to leverage,” Arcane Research wrote in a report.  Also on Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision by 60 days on NYDIG’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The delay contributed to a sour mood across crypto markets as some tokens experienced a brief pullback after the announcement.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,238, +0.60%  Ether (ETH): $3,815, +3.01%  S&P 500: $4,793, -0.06%  Gold: $1,814, +0.61%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.64%  Dull January ahead?  Historically, bitcoin tends to fall in January. The chart below shows the average monthly return in January is -3.3% over the past nine years. Over the same period, however, bitcoin registered a positive return roughly 50% of the time.  The probability of a positive outcome in January is mixed. That suggests some traders who are long BTC might sell ahead of volatility or may choose to accumulate on pullbacks as February shows greater odds for price gains, according to seasonal data.  Crypto fund flows rise  Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling $9.3 billion in 2021, a 36% increase from 2020, according to a new report from CoinShares.  Some investors pulled money out of crypto funds during the final week of 2021, as outflows totaled $32 million. The third consecutive week of outflows suggests some nervousness among short-term investors after the crypto sell-off in early December.  Bitcoin investment products saw a year-over-year increase in flows of 16%, while Ethereum products saw inflows double during the same period.

The drastic move is a perhaps novel step taken by a project to mitigate the damage caused by the latest in a string of hacks, exploits and attacks that have long been rampant in decentralized finance (DeFi), and now appear to be bleeding into the “GameFi” movement.  In a tweet yesterday, the team initially said that while they had discovered a vulnerability, “no funds have been compromised” and that minting contracts had been temporarily paused.  However, a record of transactions dating back to November shows a series of addresses with custom contracts consistently depositing a sum of ILV, Illuvium’s governance token, and then withdrawing a greater sum of escrowed ILV, or sILV, rewards than would have been normally allowed by the staking program, before rolling the proceeds to a new address.  Starting at 2 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the sILV/ETH Uniswap V3 pool was drained of all funds in a series of large transactions, temporarily pushing the trading price of sILV to 0.  In a message in the project’s official Discord server, co-founder Aaron Warwick wrote, “In order to stop a security flaw from being executed, we have had to take the step of rescuing the sILV pool.”  Read more: SAND, MANA Tokens Surged in November as Crypto Traders Bet on ‘Metaverse’ Potential  Warwick added on Discord that the team has “a backstop multisig that is able to mint in extreme circumstances.” The team used this multi-signature wallet, an address with specific in-protocol permissions that needs a majority of a group of signers to execute transactions, to mint tokens and sell them for ETH, rendering sILV worthless, as there is no ETH to swap the sILV for.  It’s currently unclear how much sILV the attacker was able to cash out as ETH before the team managed to drain the pool entirely.  “We were aware that the hacker was ready to sell all their sILV, and the amount they had would have completely drained the pool,” said Warwick in an interview with CoinDesk. “We attempted to beat them to it, and they got some and we got some.”  The team is already referring to compensation plans, writing on Discord, “As soon as we can get a snapshot of the true owners of sILV we will reimburse everyone.” Warwick declined to comment further on those plans.  Warwick also advised that users should not buy into any liquidity that is added to the Uniswap pool. ILV is down .8% on the day to $1,004.33.

42411596,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOzqn,1641327978,"RIP Bogdanoffs, Inspiration for Crypto Memes","Who will dump my bags now? Yesterday, it was reported that Igor Bogdanoff, twin of Grichka, passed away due to complications of the coronavirus, six days after his brother’s untimely death of the same disease. The two were known for their flamboyance, outlandish scientific theories and mountainous cheekbones, and were, to some extent, the face of the cryptocurrency day trader.  Descendents of European nobility and preeminent figures of popular science, the twins have been commemorated in countless memes. It was often said Igor and Grichka were behind the wild price fluctuations in token markets – somehow always taking the opposite side of your trade.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “In peace and love, surrounded by his children and his family, Igor Bogdanoff left for the light on Monday January 3, 2022,” the Bogdanoff estate said, as reported by The Sun. “RIP Grichka Bogdanoff, no wonder everything is dumping,” one Twitter user wrote, referencing the popular in-joke among traders.  It’s a sad day for crypto. The Bogdanoffs were part of the crypto family since at least 2017, coming to particular prominence in the heady days of the initial coin offering rally. Known across the internet for their atypical look – their nearly identical brunette quaffs, square jaws and faces that appeared to be Botoxed or plastic (or both) – crypto traders made them into mythical figures.  In one meme, Grichka, iPhone to his chiseled face, tells some magisterial figure who can move crypto prices to “pump” or “dump” (sometimes “pomp” or “domp”) the market. In 2018, YouTuber Bizonacci teased the joke into a widely shared, minute-long video, “He Bought,” of a wojack (those black-lined drawings of the average internet user) driven into madness by the countertrading Bogdanoffs.  You never want to take any meme too seriously, but if there’s a deeper meaning here, it might be the admission that crypto is fundamentally speculative. It might be a reference to massive bagholders – early investors, project insiders – with outsized influence on crypto markets. It’s self-referential, a little mean-spirited, but all in good fun.  Often, it seemed like the Bogdanoffs were trolls themselves. They were at least familiar with their stature as memes. Last July, the twins told French TV show “Non Stop People,” the image of Grichka was downloaded more than “1.3 billion times” and put in “all blockchains between 2010-2012.” In that same interview, the twins claimed to have been former colleagues of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous figure often credited with developing Bitcoin, and even said they contributed to the network’s development.  “It is probably Nakamoto who made [the photo] circulate,” Igor Bogdanoff said, as reported by Decrypt.  See also: ‘It’s Part and Parcel of Crypto’: How Memes Drive Narrative in Crypto  The Bogdanoffs’ public personas have always bordered on the absurd. The New York Times described their role as co-hosts of “Temps X,” the French science fiction TV show that launched their media careers in the ‘70s and ‘80s, as “science clowns.” In the ‘90s, they fought (and settled) plagiarism claims concerning their book ‘’God and Science.” At the turn of the century, they published several scientific articles that put forward a theory of what happened before and during the birth of the universe, which later became the center of “the Bogdanov affair.” Recently, they were accused of swindling a bipolar millionaire.  Perhaps it’s no surprise then that the twin mathematical physicists and movie producers are tethered to the crypto industry. They walked the line between fake and real science, between absurdity and self-knowledge. On the surface, they were a little grotesque, though they said they enjoyed looking like “aliens.” They denied having plastic surgery, but they could have very well been in on the joke.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/04/rip-bogdanoffs-inspiration-for-crypto-memes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b930c3f85977aa1ad5f4716dada8a8b7dcfbbbdf-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

During a presentation at Computex last summer, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined his vision for the “many types of metaverses,” including video game versions and augmented reality-backed versions featuring non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Omniverse combines graphics, artificial intelligence (AI), simulation tools and scalable computing to help designers and creators craft 3D assets and scenes from their laptops or workstations. Omniverse is able to connect independent 3D design worlds, which are often made with incompatible tools, into a shared virtual scene.  Nvidia announced the expansion of Omniverse with new features, such as the one-click collaboration tool Nucleus Cloud, and new connectors, extensions and asset libraries built by Nvidia partners.

Stephenson called his digital environment “the Metaverse.”  Twenty-eight years later, public companies like Meta (formerly Facebook) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) like the Decentraland Foundation have been working to make the metaverse a profitable reality. That has opened up entirely new revenue opportunities for retail investors, gamers, digital collectors and developers.  It’s important to note, however, that the metaverse is still in its infancy and its value proposition has yet to be proven. Any investment in the metaverse should be considered speculative and highly risky.

Roblox has grown rapidly since its inception in 2006, with 9.5 million independent developers, 24 million unique digital experiences and 49.4 million daily active users – up 35% year over year. Still, despite those numbers, the company has yet to turn a profit.  Boeing (NYSE: BA) - Boeing is using the metaverse to expand and improve production capabilities. In an interview with Reuters, Greg Hyslop, Boeing’s chief engineer, said that the plane maker is planning to create a proprietary digital environment where its human, computer and robot employees can communicate and collaborate seamlessly across the world.  Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) - Microsoft is looking to find its metaverse niche in the professional world. The company plans to release Mesh for Microsoft Teams in 2022. The add-on to the popular video conferencing platform will allow individuals to generate personalized avatars and collaborate in a holographic 3D environment that transcends geographic boundaries. A key feature of Microsoft Mesh will be Holoportation, which is a tool that allows users to access the previously mentioned digital environment with a VR headset. The user appears as a digital lifelike representation of themselves with the ability to interact with team members as if they were in person. On February 2nd 2022, Business Insider released a report stating that Microsoft has stopped working on a retail-focused augmented reality headset with metaverse capabilities due to ""a lack of a unified strategy."" How this development impacts it's business-facing metaverse endeavors remains to be seen.  What is metaverse land?  Although the metaverse is still in its infancy, platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland have already begun selling digital real estate in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), digital tokens on blockchain networks that can represent a wide range of unique items. When an individual purchases a piece of metaverse land, the blockchain network powering the metaverse platform verifies the sale and transfer of ownership.  Once the virtual real estate is purchased, the owner of the metaverse land NFT can rent, sell or build on his digital property. Japanese video game maker Atari recently purchased 20 parcels of digital land in Decentraland and created its very own crypto casino. Using its own native ERC20-based Atari token, gamblers can place bets and receive winnings in crypto tax-free. Atari has also announced plans to launch its own virtual hotel complex in 2022.  How to buy land in the metaverse and other digital items  Several metaverse platforms have created marketplaces where users can buy and sell digital land and other collectibles in the form of NFTs. Here is how to do it.  The user who wishes to purchase metaverse real estate needs to identify which platform he would like to purchase digital land. Popular options are Decentraland and The Sandbox, although there are several others. Do your own research before buying any land in the metaverse.  The user needs to create a digital cryptocurrency wallet, a type of computer software that connects to a blockchain network and stores cryptocurrency and is compatible with the associated blockchain that powers the metaverse platform.  From there, the purchaser needs to access the marketplace of his chosen metaverse platform and connect his digital wallet to it. Marketplaces can typically be found on metaverse platform websites.  At this stage, purchasing digital land looks a lot like buying land in the physical world. A buyer needs to consider the price, location and future value of the digital land he is considering purchasing.  Once the buyer has identified a piece of land, he needs to acquire the tokens or coins to buy it with and store them on his digital wallet. The type of token or coin that will be needed to execute the transaction varies by metaverse platform. For instance, to purchase digital land in Decentraland, the user would need to purchase MANA tokens. If he wished to purchase land in The Sandbox, he would need to acquire SAND tokens.  If the buyer has already connected his digital wallet to the metaverse marketplace and funded it, all he needs to do is place a bid on the land or buy the land outright. The cost of the land will be removed from the digital wallet and the NFT representing the land will be transferred to the user’s wallet.  The same process applies to buying other metaverse NFT items such as clothing and accessories for avatars.  Metaverse crypto  Metaverse projects on blockchain networks are powered by fungible tokens – tokens that are divisible and can be mutually exchanged. These tokens are used to purchase digital assets like virtual land or outfits for avatars. They can also be traded for other crypto or fiat currencies. Certain metaverse cryptocurrencies also allow their owners to vote on decisions within a metaverse platform such as where money should be invested or which new features to release first.  Theoretically, as the value of digital assets rise, so will the value of their associated tokens. Furthermore, some metaverse platforms like Decentraland burn all MANA tokens used to purchase digital assets, removing them permanently from circulation and increasing the value of the remaining tokens.  Below are metaverse tokens listed in descending order by size of market capitalization (market cap). These options are inherently risky and should be considered a speculative investment. As a general rule, it’s advisable to never invest more than you are willing to lose.  Decentraland (MANA) - With a market cap of about $6 billion at the time of writing, Decentraland’s MANA token powers the Decentraland metaverse and is used as a medium of exchange on the platform’s marketplace.  The Sandbox (SAND) - The Sandbox is focused on a metaverse of user-generated content, much like Roblox. The SAND token is awarded to individuals who participate in The Sandbox’s alpha user testing. SAND tokens can also be purchased on digital exchanges. SAND is a utility, governance and staking token. Owners of SAND can use it to purchase digital goods and services, vote on proposed initiatives within The Sandbox and stake their SAND to earn further rewards.  Axie Infinity (AXS) - Unlike Decentraland’s MANA, which is used to purchase digital goods and services, Axie Infinity’s AXS token is a governance token. Those who own AXS will be able to vote on proposed decisions that will affect the Axie Infinity ecosystem, including how funds in the community treasury are spent. There are future plans to modify the AXS token so that it can be used to purchase digital goods and services on Axie Infinity.  Enjin Coin (ENJ) - Enjin is a blockchain gaming company. Unlike The Sandbox or Axie Infinity, which offer only a single metaverse product, Enjin offers its users a host of interconnected play-to-earn gaming experiences. Enjin is unique in that its native token, ENJ, is “infused” into every NFT minted within its ecosystem, arguably providing real-world value for digital assets.  The future of the metaverse?  Companies heavily invested in the metaverse are spending millions of dollars convincing consumers that the dawn of the metaverse is upon us. But will it usher in an era of mass adoption and barrier-free digital interaction or will it be a niche product, reserved for gamers and future tech enthusiasts? Only time will tell. For now, retail investors interested in the metaverse should explore these platforms and consider the metaverse’s future value for themselves.

Bitcoin Open Interest Rises To High Values As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC open interest has now reached values where mass liquidations have taken place in the past. The &apos;open interest&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of BTC futures positions currently open on derivatives exchanges. The metric accounts for both long and short positions. When the value of the metric is low, it means investors aren&apos;t using much leverage right now. Such values usually result in low volatility in the price of Bitcoin. On the other hand, high values of the indicator suggest that futures contract users are currently using a high amount of leverage. This situation can lead to high volatility in the market as big price swings can result in a liquidation squeeze.

42411587,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOzQL,1641320495,What Crypto Can Learn From Elizabeth Holmes’ Fraud Conviction,"After a yearslong saga of accusations, investigations and angry denial, erstwhile business media darling Elizabeth Holmes has reached the final stage of investor grief: conviction. A jury late Monday found that she defrauded investors in Theranos, the health-testing startup she founded and led. Optimists may think of the verdict as a broad sea change in the way the U.S. public views technology founders. But a closer look shows specific lessons that tech founders, and perhaps crypto founders in particular, should take away from Holmes’ grim downfall if they want to avoid a similar fate.  Theranos promised to invent a radical new kind of rapid and portable medical testing equipment, but a jury found that when that dream faltered, Holmes engaged in elaborate deceptions to cover up her failure. Those included running tests on competitors’ machines without disclosure, displaying fake results on tests run during investor visits and making claims about military field tests that never happened. Holmes was acquitted on charges related to defrauding patients, though several received misleading results from Theranos tests, including one woman who was mistakenly told she had a miscarriage.  There are many takeaways from the debacle. But the biggest one has to do with the fine dance that technology founders have to perfect when they’re raising money based on big promises. Some commentators have argued that Holmes’ conviction is a rebuke to the much broader trend of excessive investment hype that has swept the technology sector – arguably for decades, and acutely over the past 10 years or so.  There’s a big difference between promising people the moon, and claiming you’ve already gotten there.  That’s a reasonable takeaway. It’s not hard to imagine a jury six or seven years ago, at the peak if techno-optimism, looking at the same evidence and letting Holmes walk. Holmes’ defense argued in part, and rightly, that making big promises is part of the tech ethos, and failure to fulfill those promises is in itself not a crime. Holmes was ultimately found to have gone well beyond big promises, but the distinction could easily have been lost on jurors.  But the U.S. has moved from an era of techno-optimism to one of tech backlash, substantially triggered by Facebook’s reputed role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Since then, we have seen vastly increased public skepticism of tech companies, starting with privacy but extending to many other issues. Public awareness and journalistic focus on the dark side of tech has increased substantially, helping tarnish the halos of entrepreneurs who were for many years regarded, by default, as world-changing saviors. This broader shift can’t be lost on crypto entrepreneurs, most recently in the venomous reaction to Matt Damon’s ad for Crypto.com.  But Holmes shouldn’t be mistaken for a mere avatar of broader frustration with tech-investment hype. She made specific moral and tactical mistakes, and especially if you’re involved in technology startups yourself, it’s important to see exactly where and how she went wrong.  To be cynical about it, Holmes committed the same sins that many mainstream U.S. liberals lay at the feet of former President Donald Trump. While we all know presidents and legislators engage in deception and graft, Trump went about his lying and corruption incorrectly. While George W. Bush incited a whole war to enrich his U.S. oil buddies, Trump collected hotel-room charges from the Secret Service. Bush, despite the larger moral crime, didn’t face real consequences because he followed the tradition of laundering his agenda through the U.S. national security apparatus.  Read more: Marc Hochstein – Theranos Fraud Holds Harsh Lessons for Crypto (From 2018)  Holmes, similarly, tried to work in the same genre of utopian rhetoric as Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, both of whom are successful and at least somewhat respected despite many years of overpromising and under-delivering. But Holmes ultimately crossed the fine but bright line between “fake it ‘til you make it” and just plain “fake it,” winding up engaged in a brand of cheap chicanery more in line with alleged truck maker Nikola’s infamous “let’s just roll this inoperable vehicle down a hill” stunt.  Of course, even the most carefully framed promises can eventually collapse. The current closest thing to Theranos in mainstream investing is Tesla’s goal of creating fully self-driving cars, which CEO Elon Musk has been saying is just around the corner for many, many years. In fact, he started selling the technology more than five years ago, and it still doesn’t exist.  What Elon hasn’t done, though, is fake the performance of the current version of a self-driving car. The Tesla equivalent of what Holmes was convicted of yesterday would have involved putting a journalist or investor in the driver’s seat of a Tesla and claiming it was being driven by artificial intelligence, when the car was instead being controlled by a staffer hiding in the trunk.  None of this, of course, is legal advice. Anyone looking to start a company or project should retain serious legal talent to guide investor communications. But the general principle is clear enough: There’s a big difference between promising people the moon and claiming you’ve already gotten there.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42411604,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP0Dw,1641316401,Polymarket’s CFTC Fine Hints at DeFi Regulation Roadmap,"Polymarket will pay a $1.4 million fine and wind down some prediction markets after a CFTC investigation found it was offering illicit options contracts in the U.S. This is very likely just a beginning for DeFi projects facing the regulatory gauntlet.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Prediction markets beware?  The narrative  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed an enforcement action against Polymarket, alleging it violated federal commodities laws and regulations by offering prediction markets in the U.S. without registering with the agency. Polymarket cooperated closely with the investigation, leading to a reduced penalty. I’m guessing this cooperation also means the investigation wrapped up quickly where other investigations might not have.  Why it matters  2022 is barely three days old, and it’s already taking off. To date, a lot of how the industry interprets regulations has been through agency enforcement actions – in other words, agencies explain which laws are being broken by XYZ project. Polymarket’s enforcement action is likely a preview of some of what we can expect to see this year.  Breaking it down  The first enforcement action of 2022 came against Polymarket, a prediction market that longtime readers of this newsletter’s predecessor might remember from when I tracked its 2020 election market.  The CFTC said Polymarket’s, uh, markets are binary options contracts, which can only be offered by Designated Contracts Markets (DCMs) and Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs) in the U.S. Polymarket has not sought either designation, meaning its markets were in violation of federal law and the CFTC’s regulations.  Under the terms of the enforcement action, Polymarket will pay a $1.4 million fine, wind down markets not in compliance and allow users to recoup their funds.  In a statement, a Polymarket spokesperson said that three markets currently set to resolve after Jan. 14 would be wound down. A quick search of Polymarket’s site indicates that there are six markets currently set to resolve past Jan. 14 – four on the U.S.’ seven-day COVID-19 stats, one on U.S. President Joe Biden’s approval rating and one on whether NFL quarterback-turned-minor-league-baseball-player-turned-tight-end Tim Tebow will score a touchdown by the end of the season.  Most of these will expire on Jan. 15. The Tebow one is currently set to expire a month later. That being said, my understanding is that after Polymarket winds down its open markets, there will be no open markets after Jan. 15.  “We appreciate that in today’s resolution, the CFTC recognizes our substantial cooperation and efforts to date to engage with them transparently on these topics and to educate them on the architecture and foundational DeFi primitives underlying Polymarket,” the company said in a statement.  There are a few takeaways here. First, this is probably not great news for other crypto/decentralized finance (DeFi) prediction markets that are accessible in the U.S. Back in 2020, I followed FTX, Augur and Everipedia’s PrediQt markets. FTX geofences its U.S. users and as far as I can tell, Americans can’t access the prediction markets.  I couldn’t tell if PrediQt and Augur have similar geofences after a quick search. I’ll be watching for any further actions related to those two platforms.  Yesterday’s action wasn’t a surprise. We’ve known about an investigation into Polymarket – that the company appears to have cooperated with – since at least October, and former CFTC Commissioner Dan Berkovitz straight up said that DeFi platforms offering derivatives products would run afoul of the agency’s remit.  While this first action was focused on a prediction market, I have to imagine this is the sort of precedent every DeFi project operating in the U.S. might want to pay attention to, particularly if they offer trading services for anything that could be perceived as a derivative product.  Also, as noted by attorney Collins Belton, the actual order published by the CFTC appears to acknowledge decentralization (or a lack thereof) as a factor in its decision to bring an action against Polymarket. In other words, a more fully decentralized prediction market may have an easier time of it.  The CFTC also appears to note a distinction in automated market makers (AMMs) being algorithmically driven, implying that not all AMMs may fall under the CFTC’s registration requirements, according to Belton.  “DeFi presents unique challenges to both builders and regulators, and Polymarket remains committed to working with regulators to ensure that the rules currently governing digital assets and DeFi are sufficiently clear, allow for innovation in the United States, and protect individuals’ interests and the integrity of U.S. markets,” Polymarket said in its statement. “We remain optimistic and look forward to a productive relationship with the CFTC that carves out a compliant path for DeFi products in the future.”  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Jelena McWilliams, the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said she would resign from the federal bank regulator in a surprise New Year’s Eve announcement. This comes after what’s been described as a power struggle between McWilliams, a GOP-nominated holdover from the Donald Trump administration, and Democrats, including recently-confirmed CFPB Director Rohit Chopra and Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu.

Binance Still Not Authorized to Operate in Ontario, Securities Commission Says: Crypto exchange Binance told its Ontario-based users that they did not need to shutter their accounts at the end of 2021 because it was registered in the Canadian province. This appears to have been news to the Ontario Securities Commission, which said Binance’s notice was “unacceptable.”  Indian Ruling Party-Aligned Group Takes Stance on Crypto Regulation: An economic group aligned with India’s ruling party wants private cryptocurrencies to be banned, reports Amitoj Singh. While this group, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, has some influence, this doesn’t necessarily mean its recommendation will be taken up by India’s government.  Estonia Regulator Says No Plans to Ban Crypto: Last week, there were reports that Estonia planned to ban decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-custodial wallets. Sandali Handagama reports that Estonia’s finance ministry said this is inaccurate – but the European nation does intend to implement the Financial Action Task Force’s recommendations for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including know-your-customer and capital requirement rules on crypto exchanges and decentralized wallet providers.  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Wall Street Journal) WSJ reports that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong bought a home in Los Angeles for $133 million. Put another way, Armstrong spent $2 million less on a house than FTX did in its deal to secure the naming rights for the Miami Heat’s stadium for 19 years, or $33 million more than Crypto.com did on an ad campaign that’s playing a lot during this college football bowl season.

As we move into the future, we find increasing need for a zero-trust interaction system.  Even pre-Snowden, we had realized that entrusting our information to arbitrary entities on the internet was fraught with danger. However, post-Snowden the argument plainly falls in the hands of those who believe that large organizations and governments routinely attempt to stretch and overstep their authority. Thus we realize that entrusting our information to organizations in general is a fundamentally broken model. The chance of an organization not meddling with our data is merely the effort required minus its expected gains. Given that companies tend to have income models that require they know as much about people as possible, the realist will realize that the potential for covert misuse is difficult to overestimate.  The protocols and technologies on the web, and even at large the internet, served as a great technology preview. The workhorses of SMTP, FTP, HTTP(S), PHP, HTML and Javascript each helped contribute to the sort of rich cloud-based applications we see today such as Google’s Drive, Facebook and Twitter, not to mention the countless other applications ranging through games, shopping, banking and dating. However, going into the future, much of these protocols and technologies will have to be re-engineered according to our new understandings of the interaction between society and technology.  Web 3.0, or as might be termed the “post-Snowden” web, is a re-imagination of the sorts of things we already use the web for, but with a fundamentally different model for the interactions between parties. Information that we assume to be public, we publish. Information we assume to be agreed upon, we place on a consensus ledger. Information that we assume to be private, we keep secret and never reveal. Communication always takes place over encrypted channels and only with pseudonymous identities as endpoints; never with anything traceable (such as IP addresses).  In short, we engineer the system to mathematically enforce our prior assumptions, since no government or organization can reasonably be trusted.  There are four components to the post-Snowden web: static content publication, dynamic messages, trustless transactions and an integrated user interface.  Publication  The first, we already have much of: a decentralized, encrypted information publication system. All this does is take a short intrinsic address of some information (a hash, if we’re being technical) and return, after some time, the information itself. New information can be submitted to it. Once downloaded, we can be guaranteed it’s the right information since the address is intrinsic to it. This static publication system accounts for much of HTTP(S)’s job and all that of FTP. There are already many implementations of this technology, but the easiest to cite is that of BitTorrent. Every time you click on a magnet link of BitTorrent, all you’re really doing is telling your client to download the data whose intrinsic address (hash) is equal to it.  In Web 3.0, this portion of the technology is used to publish and download any (potentially large) static portion of information that we are happy to share. We are able, just as with BitTorrent, to incentivize others to maintain and share this information; however, combined with other portions of Web 3.0, we can make this more efficient and precise. Because an incentive framework is intrinsic to the protocol, we become (at this level, anyway) DDoS-proof by design. How’s that for a bonus?  Messaging  The second portion of Web 3.0 is an identity-based pseudonymous low-level messaging system. This is used for communicating between people on the network. It uses strong cryptography in order to make a number of guarantees about the messages; they can be encrypted with an identity’s public key in order to guarantee only that identity can decode it. They can be signed by the sender’s private key to guarantee that it does indeed come from the sender and provide the receiver with a secure receipt of communication. A shared secret can provide the opportunity to communicate securely, including between groups, without the necessity of proof of receipt.  Since each of these provides ultimate message logistics, the use of transmission-protocol level addresses becomes needless; addresses, once comprised of a user or port and an IP address, now become merely a hash.  Messages would have a time-to-live, allowing the disambiguation between publication messages that one may wish to be “alive” for as long as possible to guarantee as many identities see it and instant signaling messages that wish to be transmitted as quickly as possible across the network. Thus the dichotomy of latency and longevity is traded.  Actual physical routing would be carried out through a game-theoretic adaptive network system. Each peer attempts to maximize their value to other peers in the assertion that the other peers are valuable to them for the incoming information. A peer whose information is not valuable would be disconnected and their slot taken with a connection to some other, perhaps unknown (or perhaps second-degree), peer. In order that a peer be more useful, messages with some specific attributes would be requested (a sender address or topic, for example – both unencrypted – beginning with a particular bit string).  In Web 3.0, this portion allows peers to communicate, update and self-organize in real time, publishing information whose precedence does not need to be intrinsically trusted or later referred. In the traditional web, this is much of the information that travels over HTTP in AJAX style implementations.  Consensus  The third portion of Web 3.0 is the consensus engine. Bitcoin introduced many of us to the idea of a consensus-based application. However, this was merely the first tentative step. A consensus engine is a means of agreeing some rules of interaction, in the knowledge that future interactions (or lack thereof) will automatically and irrevocably result in the enforcement exactly as specified. It is effectively an all-encompassing social contract and draws its strength from the network effect of consensus.  The fact that the effects of a renege of one agreement may be felt in all others is key to creating a strong social contract and thus reducing the chances of renege or willful ignorance. For example, the more a reputation system is isolated from a more personal social interaction system, the less effective the reputation system will be. A reputation system combined with Facebook or Twitter-like functionality would work better than one without, since users place an intrinsic value on what their friends, partners or colleagues think of them. A particularly poignant example of this is the difficult question of whether, and when, to befriend on Facebook an employer or dating partner.  Consensus engines will be used for all trustful publication and alteration of information. This will happen through a completely generalized global transaction processing system. The first workable example of this is the Ethereum project.  The traditional web does not fundamentally address consensus, instead falling back on centralized trust of authorities, such as ICANN, Verisign and Facebook, and reducing to private and government websites together with the software upon which they are built.  Front end  The fourth and final component to the Web 3.0 experience is the technology that brings this all together; the “browser” and user interface. Funnily enough, this will look fairly similar to the browser interface we already know and love. There will be the URI bar, the back button and, of course, the lion’s share will be given over to the display of the dapp (née webpage/website).  Using this consensus-based name resolution system (not unlike Namecoin in application), a URI can be reduced to the unique address of the front-end for that application (i.e. a hash). Through the information publication system, this can be expanded into a collection of files required for the front-end (e.g. an archive containing .html, .js, .css and .jpg files). This is the static portion of the dapp (-let).  It contains no dynamic content; that is instead serviced through the other communication channels. For gathering and submitting dynamic but publicly available content whose provenance needs to be absolutely determined and which must be held immutably forever (“set in stone”), such as reputation, balances and so forth, there is a Javascript-based API for interacting with the consensus engine. For gathering and submitting dynamic, potentially private content that is necessarily volatile and subject to annihilation or lack of availability, the p2p-messaging engine is used.  There will be a few superficial differences; we’ll see a move away from the traditional client-server URL model of addresses like “https://address/path”, and instead start to see new-form addresses such as “goldcoin” and “uk.gov.” Name resolution will be carried out by a consensus engine-based contract and trivially be redirected or augmented by the user. Periods would allow multiple levels of name resolution - “uk.gov”, for example, might pass the “gov” subname into the name resolver given by “uk.”  Due to the ever-transient nature of the information made available to the browser automatically and accidentally through the update of the consensus back end and the maintenance of the peer network, we’ll see background dapps or dapplets play a great role in our Web 3.0 experience. Either through always-visible Mac OS dock-like dynamic iconic infographics or dashboard-style dynamic dapplets, we’ll be kept accidentally up to date about that which we care.  After the initial synchronization process, page-loading times will reduce to zero as the static data is pre-downloaded and guaranteed up to date, and the dynamic data (delivered through the consensus engine or p2p-messaging engine) are also maintained up to date. While being synchronized, the user experience will be perfectly solid though actual information shown may be out of date (though may easily not, and can be annotated as such).  For a user of Web 3.0, all interactions will be carried out pseudonymously, securely, and for many services, trustlessly. Those that require a third party or parties, the tools will give the users and App-developers the ability to spread the trust among multiple different, possibly competing, entities, massively reducing the amount of trust one must place in the hands of any given single entity.  With the separation of APIs from front end and back ends, we’ll see additional ability to utilize differing front-end solutions able to deliver a superior user experience. Qt’s QtQuick and QML technologies could, for example, be a stand-in replacement for the HTML/CSS combination of traditional web technologies and would provide native interfaces and rich accelerated graphics with minimal syntactical overhead and on a highly effective reactive-programming paradigm.  Migration  The changeover will be gradual.  On Web 2, we’ll increasingly see sites whose back ends utilize Web 3.0-like components such as Bitcoin, BitTorrent and Namecoin. This trend will continue, and the truly Web 3.0 platform Ethereum will likely be used by sites that wish to provide transactional evidence of their content, such as voting sites and exchanges. Of course, a system is only as secure as the weakest link, and so eventually such sites will transition themselves onto a Web 3.0 browser which can provide end-to-end security and trustless interaction.  Say “hello” to Web 3.0, a secure social operating system.  Originally entitled “Dapps: What Web 3.0 Looks Like” and published April 17, 2014 on Gavin Wood’s blog, Insights Into a Modern World.

The NEAR token hit a new all-time high of $17.48 before a brief sell-off at the time of writing.  The moves defied stagnation in the price movements of major cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether, which fell 2% in the past 24 hours, data from CoinGecko showed.  Layer 1 networks refer to individual blockchain platforms such as Ethereum or Avalanche, atop of which decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or other software can be built. DeFi itself refers to protocols and services that rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen to provide financial services, such as trading, lending and borrowing, to users.  Why NEAR is surging  Most DeFi activity has centered around Ethereum-based applications since 2019. But slow speeds and an expensive network have led to users migrating to cheaper and faster networks.  Avalanche (AVAX), Solana (SOL) and Terra (LUNA) have emerged as top contenders in the past month – attracting billions of dollars in capital – but investors are now betting on the upside of even more networks, such as Near and Fantom, among others.  Early Asian trading hours on Tuesday saw NEAR break its previous highs of $16.20, reaching as high as $17.59 on some exchanges in European trading hours before dropping 50 cents. Over $1 billion worth of NEAR changed hands in the past 24 hours, with much of the trading activity occurring on crypto exchange Binance.  This is despite a relatively smaller amount of capital – just a little above $141 million – locked up on Near-based DeFi protocols. This puts Near at 29th among all DeFi-enabled blockchains, as per DeFi Llama.  NEAR prices started rising in late December 2021 on the back of an integration with Terra, the world’s second-largest DeFi blockchain by total valued locked (TVL), and its UST stablecoin. NEAR prices bumped 20% in the hours after that announcement, and the uptrend has since continued.  FTM climbs  Fantom was the other big gainer in mid-European trading hours on Tuesday. Prices surged 21% in Asian trading hours before tumbling to $2.97 at the time of writing. FTM has now risen over 133% in the past two weeks. DeFi protocols built on the network hold over $5.91 billion in value, according to DeFi Llama. $2 billion of that came in the past two weeks alone.  Technical charts show FTM remains in an uptrend but faces resistance at the $3 mark, a level the tokens saw selloffs from in November 2021.

Dot Finance automates and maximizes rewards for its users and helps them earn fees from other DeFi services, such as lending, trading and borrowing. Similar to other DeFi applications, Dot Finance uses smart contracts instead of third parties to provide financial services to users.  “Bringing our yield aggregation products to Moonbeam is pivotal for Dot Finance’s growth trajectory,” said Nir Rozin, Dot Finance’s co-founder, in a press release. “Merging Dot Finance’s tools for DeFi with Moonriver’s safe, secure and resilient architecture will help spearhead Polkadot adoption while reducing participation barriers for users.”  Polkadot and Kusama are blockchains that allow developers to build entire blockchains – not mere applications – atop their own networks. These blockchains are referred to as parachains and canaries, respectively, in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.  Moonbeam was the second parachain to go live on Polkadot. It brings Ethereum-like smart contract capabilities to the Polkadot network, allowing for the likes of Dot Finance to build out DeFi services for users.  Read more: Polkadot Parachains Go Live, Capping Yearslong Tech Build for Ambitious Blockchain Project  The first part of the migration process will involve taking Dot Finance’s yield aggregation contracts and adapting them for Moonriver on Polkadot canary network Kusama. The initial yield strategies will focus on liquidity pools on Kusama-based decentralized exchange Solarbeam.  Liquidity pools are a collection of funds locked in a smart contract used to facilitate decentralized trading, lending and similar DeFi services. Users earn a cut of all fees generated via such services, in a process colloquially known as “yield farming.”  Dot Finance plans to integrate with the multichain exchange Sushi to maximize the users’ returns for yield farming, in addition to many other protocols in the future, according to a press release.",POSITIVE,없음,DOT | EXCHANGE | MINING | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/04/dex-aggregator-dot-finance-migrates-to-polkadot-from-bsc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee46df10f40dafecaee2865a98a9815e81a0637b-4901x3267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423962,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2itxh,1641298318,"Kevin O’Leary-Backed DeFi Platform WonderFi to Purchase Bitbuy for $162M in Cash, Shares","DeFi platform WonderFi Technologies Inc. agreed to buy Canadian crypto exchange Bitbuy for C$206 million ($161.8 million) in cash and shares, bringing the ability to purchase crypto and access to decentralized finance (DeFi) under one roof.  WonderFi will pay with 70 million new shares and C$50 million ($39 million) in cash, the company said in a statement Tuesday.  The deal gives WonderFi one of Canada’s fastest-growing crypto platforms, adding 375,000 registered users. The combination will allow it to provide retail customers with an integrated system for buying and investing crypto as it seeks to become an end-to-end consumer platform.  “A licensed marketplace serves as a crucial gateway to the digital asset economy, and facilitates a robust end-to-end, unified client experience,” WonderFi CEO Ben Samaroo said in the statement. “The integration of Bitbuy’s product suite will accelerate and expand the reach and scope that WonderFi can offer to the market, and will drive long-term growth and value.”  Vancouver-based WonderFi closed a financing round in June that included strategic investor Kevin O’Leary. The company rebranded to WonderFi from Defi Ventures in a nod to O’Leary’s nickname as “Mr. Wonderful” from television shows “Shark Tank” and “Dragon’s Den.” WonderFi also credits the billionaire founder of crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, as a strategic investor, according to its latest presentation.  O’Leary has been an advocate for crypto in recent months and said in a 2022 outlook that his largest position is in ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain. He also said he owns Polygon (MATIC) and Solana, in addition to bitcoin.  WonderFi is publicly listed on Canada’s NEO Exchange under stock ticker WNDR. The shares rose as much as 13% in early trading, giving the company a market cap of about C$188 million ($148 million).  Bobby Halpern, principal of Toronto-based Halpern & Co., acquired Bitbuy toward the beginning of 2018, when the exchange had about 500 customers and bitcoin prices were crashing. The company generated over C$31 million ($24 million) in revenue during the 12-month period ended Sept. 30, according to the statement.  Read more: Down More than 70% in 2018, Bitcoin Closes Its Worst Year on Record  The deal is expected to close in the first quarter, with Bitbuy’s president and chief financial officer, Dean Skurka, set to join WonderFi’s board.

Investment bank Haywood Securities gave a fairness opinion to WonderFi’s board on the deal, while Canaccord Genuity is the financial adviser to Bitbuy.

As of Dec. 31, Canaan had 10,300 AvalonMiners in operation in Kazakhstan, the firm announced on Tuesday.  Canaan is now collaborating with local firms to form a joint-mining business in Kazakhstan as part of its migration away from its native China following the crackdown on the industry there last spring.  The firm did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request to name its local partners.  Canaan had deployed 2,000 mining rigs in Kazakhstan towards the end of last year. It operated 32,000 terahash per second (TH/s) of computing power and plans to operationalize 850,000 TH/s “in the near term,” the company said in November.  Kazakhstan is among the most preferred locations for mining firms thanks to its abundance of cheap electricity. However, the sudden influx of crypto miners last year overwhelmed parts of the country’s electrical grid.

42423964,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iu3h,1641294910,CRV Extends Rally as ‘Curve Wars’ Intensify,"CRV, the governance token of decentralized exchange (DEX) Curve.Fi, is extending its five-month winning streak as the battle between DeFi protocols for control leads to a demand-supply imbalance.  CoinDesk data shows CRV has gained 23% this month, with prices rising 12% to $6.56 in the past 24 hours. The token rallied 127% in the final quarter of 2021 even as market leader bitcoin rose just 5%.  As of Tuesday, about 86% of the token’s $3 billion supply is locked up in various DeFi, or decentralized finance, protocols, according to CoinMarketCap. The declining liquidity could be attributed to DeFi protocols competing to accumulate CRV to influence the decision-making at the DEX in a way that benefits them the most.  “An increasingly large amount of CRV is being locked up as veCRV, which has the effect of offsetting some of the supply emissions,” Jason Choi, general partner and head of research at Spartan Capital, said in an email. “Protocols like Convex are locking up almost 50% of all veCRV, as other protocols are accumulating CVX, the token to Convex. In other words, more and more protocols are building off of Curve, and an entire ecosystem is emerging, engaged in the so-called Curve Wars.”  The Curve Wars land grab  Curve Finance is a community-governed DEX facilitating the exchange of stablecoins. Decisions are made on-chain by CRV holders who gain the right to vote by locking their tokens for nearly four years to convert them into veCRV. The veCRV are used to vote in governance, boost governance rewards, earn trading fees and receive airdrops. The longer CRV is locked, the more voting power holders have and vice versa.  “One of the major powers given to veCRV holders is the ability to change gauge weights, which determine the amount of CRV rewards allocated to each pool on Curve,” DeFi Education said in a blog post published in November.  An entity intending to establish control over Curve Finance needs to consistently accumulate CRV and convert it into veCRV.  Thus, yield-boosting application Convex Finance and other DeFi protocols such as Yearn Finance and StakeDAO are luring CRV holders by offering attractive returns on staking. The protocols then deposit the CRV received into Curve Finance and collect veCRV, gaining voting power to allocate more CRV rewards to the pools for which they provided liquidity. That’s akin to a land grab.  “Recently, the ‘Curve Wars’ have been a hot topic‚” analysts at Delphi Digital said in Monday’s research note. “Simply put, Curve’s stablecoin AMM [automated market maker] rewards its liquidity providers with CRV, which can be 1) sold to realize yield or 2) staked into veCRV (voting escrowed CRV), where a weekly vote decides how rewards are allocated across Curve’s pools,” they wrote.  “Major stablecoin projects have realized this weekly vote allocation is critical to keeping their Curve liquidity high. (Losing that vote means LPs’ yields drop, and capital may move elsewhere.) Now, a so-called ‘war’ has ensued, with various protocols openly bribing votes and rewarding veCRV holders with their native tokens,” Delphi’s analysts added.  Convex Finance is currently the single largest owner of veCRV, holding 47% of the total supply. The protocol was offering an APY [annual percentage yield] of 48% on staked CRV at press time – that’s nearly 10 times greater than APYs offered by various pools across the multibillion-dollar DeFi industry.  “This gives them [Convex] the most governance power to decide where CRV incentives should be distributed,” Delphi Digital noted. CRV holders staking their coins on Convex Finance receive cvxCRV tokens as a deposit receipt. These coins are freely tradable, unlike veCRV, which is non-transferable. cvxCRV holders receive a share in Curve’s trading fees and boosted CRV rewards and earn Convex’s governance token CVX.  Convex Finance is built on top of Curve and allows Curve liquidity providers and CRV stakers to earn additional yields without having to lock up CRV tokens for lengthy periods. The protocol crossed $20 billion in total value locked (TVL) over the weekend, becoming the second-largest decentralized finance protocol by TVL. The largest is Curve itself, with $24.3 billion locked.  “[There is] an interesting dynamic with Convex Finance where a lot of CRV is getting locked up,” Henrik Andersson, co-founder, and chief investment officer of Australia-based crypto-asset investment firm Apollo Capital told CoinDesk in a LinkedIn chat. “We have been bullish and large holders of CRV since the beginning. We were one of the largest early liquidity providers on Curve.”  With Convex dominating the race to accumulate CRV, some protocols have resorted to purchasing CVX, Convex’s governance token. “Instead of buying CRV tokens and staking them for veCRV to vote, protocols have resorted to bribing vlCVX holders directly. (For reference, vlCVX is Convex’s token that’s locked for 16 weeks that can harness Convex’s underlying veCRV governance powers),” Delphi Digital noted.  The CVX token was up 5%, near $50 at the time of writing.",POSITIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/04/crv-extends-rally-as-curve-wars-intensify,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54e2d06fc61ac4ac217f6f8bec1535e2a03f4d3f-1694x814.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Our devices are more expensive to insure than ever and the global mobile phone insurance market is expected to be worth more than $40 billion by 2025. That&apos;s why Lox&apos;s mission is to better control smartphone thefts by creating the world&apos;s first decentralized security network, giving the power back to smartphone owners rather than wireless carriers or other third parties. The Challenges: Siloed Data, Proof-of-ownership, and Data-sharing Wireless device data is locked behind silos, allowing stolen phones to be sold on the black market with ease. This makes it very difficult to retrieve information from your device such as where it comes from, its previous owners, and purchase dates. Essentially, your smartphone data, even though you own it, is very hard to acquire. Network providers don&apos;t help the situation either, as they operate in silos and aren&apos;t keen on sharing any device information with users, insurers, or law enforcement. Furthermore, insurers often struggle to send the right information to owners. Say, for example, you buy your new smartphone from a well-known high-street retailer, but you insure it with another provider.

Osmosis tokens (OSMO) surged 13% to $7.78 in the last 24 hours, reaching new highs and crossing the November high of $6.80, according to data from CoinGecko. OSMO holders can stake their tokens to receive yields and rewards, and participate in platform governance to suggest measures for expanding the protocol.  Osmosis has caught on recently amid revived interest in blockchains apart from Ethereum, which is expensive to use and has relatively slower transaction times. Daily average trading volume on Osmosis rose from $4.1 million in July to $46.6 million in December, data from analytics tool Token Terminal show.  How Osmosis works and what drives its value  Osmosis relies on smart contracts instead of middlemen to execute trades between users. Much of its value proposition, however, arises from its future plans. The DEX aims to expand to other blockchains, such as Ethereum, as well as blockchains compliant with the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.  IBC is a protocol that relays messages between blockchains, allowing them to transfer and share data with each other. It was initially created to connect blockchains based on Tendermint, a software that allows developers to replicate applications on networks built atop its platform.  Cosmos is the first Tendermint network and a self-styled “internet of blockchains.” Its developers aim to create an ecosystem where applications exist on separate blockchains but can communicate with each other. Such an arrangement helps blockchains and cryptocurrencies go mainstream as users would ideally interact with several blockchains without having to manually change them each time and log into a separate application.  Cosmos is the 18th-largest blockchain network by market capitalization.  Osmosis has also helped kickstart activity on IBC. In June, IBC developers tweeted that the protocol processed more than 19,500 transactions per day after its launch, up from a mere 236 transactions per day before the launch.  In October, Osmosis raised $21 million in a token sale that was led by Paradigm Capital.  Read more: One Billion, Two Billion, Three Billion, Four?

WOO also provides liquidity to other decentralized protocols such as DYDX, Matcha, ParaSwap, 1inch and DODO.  WOO Network closed a $30 million Series A fundraising round in November that included investments from Avalanche, BitTorrent, Crypto.com Capital and Three Arrows Capital.  Founded in 2017, Binance Labs tends to make early-stage investments in companies such as hackathon organizer DoraHacks and interoperability startup LayerZero, but the investor and incubator has also participated in later, larger funding rounds, such as the recent $110 million Series C fundraising round for crypto staking firm Figment that was led by investment firm Thoma Bravo.  The price for the project’s WOO tokens were up 10% over the past 24 hours, nearing a market capitalization of $1 billion, as of 11:52 coordinated universal time (6:52 a.m. ET), according to CoinGecko.

42423950,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2itjh,1641282591,Estonia Regulator Says No Plans to Ban Crypto,"Estonia’s Ministry of Finance said on Sunday that new draft legislation for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) will not ban customers from owning or trading crypto, but the proposed requirements for VASPs could apply to decentralized wallet creators, including hefty capital requirements.  Sunday’s statement came after news spread that the proposed bill would effectively ban decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-custodial wallets. A non-custodial wallet gives users full ownership of their crypto and private keys.  The above tweet was referring to new rules set out in a draft bill that was approved by Estonia’s Parliament on Dec. 23. In the statement, Estonia’s Ministry of Finance Keit Pentus-Rosimannus said the bill is designed to tighten anti-money laundering (AML) requirements for VASPs, particularly to reduce the creation of anonymous accounts. If approved, under the new law, Estonian VASPs will be required to identify their customers when offering accounts or wallets.  “This means that the legislation does not contain any measures to ban customers from owning and trading virtual assets and does not in any way require customers to share their private keys to wallets,” the statement said.  On Monday, the ministry also published an informational page addressing commonly asked questions about the proposed bill. According to the ministry, the proposed bill is Estonia’s answer to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidance on regulating VASPs.  “Essentially, the proposals are tech-agnostic. We regulate services provided, not specific technologies. The aim is to regulate VASPs insofar as they perform the same functions as a financial service would,” said Märt Belkin, spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance, in an email to CoinDesk.  The publication said that the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which started licensing VASPs in 2017, was too lenient with its initial licensing requirements for crypto service providers. In 2020, the FIU withdrew licenses from more than 1,000 crypto firms citing poor connections to Estonia. Under the new law, an Estonian-licensed VASP has to operate in Estonia or “have a demonstrable connection” to the country.  The new bill also proposes steeper capital requirements for VASPs. Depending on the services provided, VASPs will now be required to have a minimum share capital of €125,000 (around $141,000) or €350,000 (around $395,000). For comparison, the current minimum is €12,000 or around $13,500.  The requirement for VASPs to collect identifying or know-your-customer (KYC) information from users is not new and builds on an existing 2020 prohibition on opening anonymous virtual accounts, according to the ministry.  The proposed rules do not “directly apply” to users of private wallets that were not set up through an Estonian VASP. “Individuals can still freely use non-custodial wallets,” the publication said.  The ministry clarified that the proposed legislation uses the FATF definition of a VASP which includes service providers like crypto exchanges, issuers and some platforms facilitating initial coin offerings (ICOs). According to the new FATF guidelines, decentralized applications, including non-custodial wallets, could also fall under the new definition of a VASP.  The FATF guidance clarifies that DeFi apps themselves are not VASPs, but says “creators, owners and operators or some other persons who maintain control or sufficient influence” in DeFi arrangements can fall under the FATF definition of a VASP.  “Technical developers are generally not considered to be service providers. However, if it is difficult to identify the service provider - for example, if the service is decentralized - several indicators must be taken into account to identify who has the largest amount of control over the terms of the service. One such indicator is to find out who benefits monetarily from providing the service,” Belkin said.  No services are to be banned, the ministry reiterated, adding that entities that “wish to provide such services in Estonia” have to simply comply with the AML rules. The bill now has to pass Parliament, and will likely come into force in the first half of 2022.

What does the biggest update to the Bitcoin network in years bring to the table? How can it help the increasingly popular Lightning Network? That&apos;s exactly what the article we&apos;re about to summarize is about. It starts by informing us that &apos;Bitcoin even has a scripting language,&apos; and that it&apos;s called Script. But before we get into that, what is Taproot? &apos;Taproot is a combination of three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that enhance this scripting infrastructure: BIP340 - Schnorr, BIP341- Taproot and BIP342 - Tapscript.

This means that multiple parties are able combine their keys to a single public key, thereby allowing them to sign a single message.&apos; It&apos;s important to know that Taproot won&apos;t allow &apos;fully expressive&apos; or &apos;Turing complete&apos; contracts like in Ethereum and all its related chains.

The DFX is a market-cap-weighted basket of cryptocurrencies, representative of the DeFi (decentralized finance) category, as defined in the CoinDesk Indices Digital Asset Classification Standard.  In accordance with the CoinDesk DeFi Index reconstitution, Grayscale adjusted the DeFi Fund’s portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing fund components in proportion to their weightings and using the cash proceeds to purchase amp (AMP).  As a result of the rebalancing, bancor (BNT) and universal market access (UMA) have been removed from the DeFi Fund.  AMP is the native token of the Flexa network, a payment network that enables crypto-collateralized payments at physical stores and online.  Flexa uses the AMP token to collateralize digital asset payments while they are confirmed on their blockchains and settles the payments in fiat to the recipient.  By enabling payments through the Flexa network, supporting merchants can more easily and confidently accept payment in BTC, ETH and other digital assets. The Flexa network is one of a number of projects intended to accelerate the development of the blockchain into a mature peer-to-peer money system, according to Grayscale.  DeFi Fund’s components as of Monday:  At the end of the day on Monday, the DeFi Fund’s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.  Uniswap (UNI), 42.33%  Aave (AAVE), 13.06%  Curve (CRV), 10.63%  MakerDAO (MKR), 8.99%  Amp (AMP), 7.39%  Yearn Finance (YFI), 6.34%  Compound (COMP), 5.02%  Synthetix (SNX), 3.15%  SushiSwap (SUSHI), 3.09%  No new tokens were added or removed from Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. This announcement follows the October news that Grayscale adjusted the Digital Large Cap Fund’s portfolio and added solana (SOL) and uniswap (UNI).  At the end of the day on Monday, the Digital Large Cap Fund’s components were a basket of the following assets and weightings:  Bitcoin (BTC), 60.50%  Ethereum (ETH), 30.13%  Solana (SOL), 3.56%  Cardano (ADA), 3.05%  Uniswap (UNI), 0.77%  Chainlink (LINK), 0.71%  Litecoin (LTC), 0.69%  Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 0.59%  Neither the DeFi Fund nor the Digital Large Cap Fund generates any income, and both regularly distribute fund components to pay for expenses. Therefore, the amount of fund components represented by shares of each fund gradually decreases over time.
