42429309,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxFZh,1530303939,Below $0.50: XRP Prices Fall to New 2018 Lows,"The price of XRP slid below $0.43 on Friday, hitting a new low for 2018.  The world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $0.424 at 13:00 UTC, surpassing the prior low of $0.438 seen just five days ago on the Bitfinex exchange. XRP has not recorded a daily close below $0.42 since December 12th, 2017.  As of press time, the figure has risen above the low, back to averaging a price of $0.43. Current prices reflect a 24-hour drop of 3.5 percent and a 14 percent decline week-to-week.  .  Market bears will look to strengthen their grip if the current level of $0.43 cannot hold as XRP is not accompanied by any neighboring technical support. The strongest layer of support may not be seen until $0.19.  XRP is not the lone cryptocurrency to set an annual low today, however, as it is joined by the likes of OmiseGo (OMG), neo (NEO), litecoin (LTC), and zcash. The largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), came just $14 shy of breaking its annual low of $5,786 earlier this morning, CoinDesk data further indicates.  Consequently, the broader market is taking a beating. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has hit $232 billion - its lowest mark since November of 2017 and a 72 percent depreciation from all-time high just under $830 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

42429307,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxFbh,1530299734,"Tron's Election Is Underway, But Who's In Control of the $2 Billion Code?","The $2 billion cryptocurrency network Tron kicked off an election this week – one of the last steps in its efforts to launch its official blockchain.  Largely free from classic campaign pageantry (there are no voting lines or oversight committees in cryptoland), the process finds the protocol seeking to leverage one of its core differentiators, a mechanism called delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) that governs how those running the software can change its rules.  The process follows the late May release of what Tron branded as a test version of the tech. Then, last week, it held a much-hyped ""Independence Day,"" which saw users begin to scrap their ethereum tokens, used for fundraising, for TRX coins on the new blockchain.  Still, it's the voting that will offer perhaps the most instructive lessons for crypto innovators given that elections-style blockchain governance remains relatively untested.  Adding to the significance is that other blockchains that have been early to embrace the concept appear to be struggling to put key concepts into practice. Already, Tron is showing signs it might be breaking from both its past statements and expected practices in ways that may say much about how the best-laid plans of distributed cryptocurrencies are always subject to change.  To understand what's occurred, it helps to revisit Tron's initial launch plan, which called for a certain number of ""delegates"" – individuals or companies, to be chosen or elected to validate blocks and process transactions on the network. Unelected, ""placeholder"" delegates were to operate the blockchain until the voting was complete.  But the process might be changing in one significant way – it's currently unclear the extent to which the Tron Foundation, which created the software and is tasked with managing the blockchain's development, is involved in the launch.  Prior to the launch, the Tron Foundation moved to ""guarantee"" that its funds would be kept separate from the voting process.  The foundation added on June 25 that it would entrust the genesis representatives with the funds, which would be stored across 1000 different addresses ""to minimize risk."" It promised to announce the addresses within three days of its post, however it has yet to disclose the information.  In practice, therefore, Tron's claim to keep its funds out of the voting process has been difficult to audit, a fact that may do much to color past statements by the project and its leadership team.  Pledging transparency  One potential issue is the transparency with which the process is being carried out.  The Tron project, for instance, has frequently sought to appeal to investors with rhetoric that emphasizes democracy and transparency, with the terms figuring prominently into communications to the public made by entities such as the Tron Foundation.  At the time of its founding, the project planned to both fundraise on and remain tied to ethereum for development. However, Tron later announced its intention to launch its own mainnet, citing both ethereum's ""inefficiencies"" and its governance as its rationale. According to the Tron Foundation, ethereum does not acknowledge what Tron has called ""the natural rights of the token.""  ""In their systems, miners, founders and developer teams hold much of the power,"" a Medium post from the foundation stated. ""Token holders do not have any governance rights. This is an oligarchic system controlled by a select few, where there is no legitimacy in the true sense of the word.""  As such, Tron has cited DPoS as a means of creating a superior network to ethereum, arguing that it allows for better transaction processing speeds while creating a more democratic governance process.  With this in mind, it's perhaps noteworthy that currently, it's unclear which entities are acting as placeholder delegates and how they were selected.  Whereas EOS, a hotly-anticipated DPoS blockchain project that launched at the beginning of June, had a well-documented process for picking the first round of validators before token holders started voting for representatives, Tron's explanations and literature on its process have been less clear.  Gaps in information  What we know is that on the Tron blockchain, 27 anonymous, temporary delegates dubbed ""genesis representatives"" are currently being tasked with operating the blockchain until token holders select an official group of ""super representatives"" by voting with their tokens.  Beyond that, there are significant informational gaps in its public statements detailing the election process.  Specifically, Tron's public statements do not make clear the means by which Tron's genesis representatives were selected, and therefore, how the entities in control of the network came into power.  In fact, the Tron team has introduced two separate narratives on this account.  In a June 19 post to a community forum on Tron's website, ""Tron_Chinese,"" a forum administrator, wrote that the project's engineers would choose the genesis representatives based on technical proficiency.  However, in a June 21 Medium post, the Tron Foundation claimed that the Tron community had chosen genesis representatives through an election.  CoinDesk is notably not alone in its inability to find information on, or mention of, the genesis representative election described in the post.  Lucas Nuzzi, of Digital Asset Research, a crypto-focused firm that recently analyzed Tron's code, said he's also searched for information on the genesis election but has come up empty-handed.  Super representative candidates that CoinDesk contacted about the issue did not respond to requests for comment.  As such, Nuzzi has gone so far as to assert that the disparity in information reveals cracks in Tron's commitment to openness.  ""Their track record shows a consistent lack of transparency,"" he told CoinDesk. ""This industry was built on the basis of transparency, and their actions so far go directly against it.""  Tron skeptics will likely agree, and point to past allegations that the project plagiarized its white paper and failed to properly attribute the ethereum code on which its protocol is, in part, based on.  However, it remains to be seen if the ambiguity around the election will cause concern among token holders. Based on the lack of discussion about the topic in Tron community forums, the community's faith in the project, and its ultimate ability to go live, seems yet to be shaken.

42429302,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxFRh,1530285411,Tether Code 'Flaw' Was Actually an Exchange Error,"Suggestions that the code for Tether's dollar-pegged cryptocurrency USDT may contain an error that can be exploited to allow double spending appear to be false.  According to the latest statements from both blockchain security firm Slow Mist, the company that made the original claim, and Tether, the startup that provides software for USDT, the issue is actually down to an exchange integration flaw.  On Thursday, Slow Mist seemed to claim in a WeChat post that when an exchange is conducting a transaction with USDT, the exchange needs to verify that the transactions details are ""true,"" otherwise a double spend can occur. The company further suggested that the problem had been used in an attack on an unnamed crypto exchange, and, in a post on Twitter, included a page of transaction data with some of the details blurred out.  The claims, if true, were potentially impactful, as the USDT token is notably used to substitute for the U.S. dollar, acting as a proxy to quickly shift funds around exchanges rather than wait for wire transfers from banks.  However, in a statement, a spokesperson for Tether emphasized that the issue was not part of the USDT protocol.  They told CoinDesk:  ""Rather, it was due to a faulty integration of Tether at the exchange level. While we can't exercise much control over how exchanges execute the integration process, we've provided integration guides in this instance to help solve the issue and will continue to assist any other exchanges in their USDT integration processes.""  Now, Slow Mist has also clarified that the issue does, in fact, lie with how exchanges integrate the USDT protocol for transactions, and not with the protocol itself.  In a statement to CoinDesk, the company said, ""There was no Tether vulnerability [itself], but rather poor handling of incoming transactions. We have updated Twitter to explain this issue. We are sorry to say that the previous description did not express clearly.""  While apparently not a Tether issue, the developments may add to the industry nervousness around the firm, which has been the subject of controversy alongside Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange to which it is closely linked. Critics have alleged that Tether's USDT token is, in spite of its claims, not fully backed by a supply of U.S. dollars and has instead been used to manipulate the cryptocurrency market.  Just last week, Tether released a report attesting to its U.S. dollar reserves as proof that the token is fully backed. As CoinDesk highlighted, though, the report falls short of serving as a fall audit of Tether's finances and comes months after the company's relationship with auditing firm Friedman came to an end.  After Slow Mist's original post caused widespread concerns over security, several exchanges including OKEx and ZB.com verified that they were unaffected by the issue.  LBank announced it ""conducted an emergency technical investigation,"" finding that it was not vulnerable. However, the exchange stated that ""we cannot guarantee the security of the other trading platforms and USDT as a whole, so we decided to close the USDT recharge temporarily.""

The 39 participants put the app – built by New York-based tech firm Synechron – through a four-day test using 45 nodes in Microsoft Azure, according to a press release. Ultimately, the group managed to conduct over 300 transactions in 19 countries across eight timezones.  The app's self-sovereign design is aimed to allow firms' customers to build and maintain their own identities, as well as enable them to approve or reject access requests from banks. When customers updated their data in the test, this was automatically updated for any banks with access permission.  R3 said in the statement:  ""Traditional KYC processes are complex and often duplicative. This self-sovereign model allows corporate customers to create and manage their own identities including relevant documentation and then grant permission to multiple participants to access this data""  According to R3, this can lead to improved efficiency and lower costs at financial institutions by ""eliminating the need for each institution to individually attest and update KYC records."" The model could also help avoid data privacy and security problems, since only parties with the need to see the data will have access to it, and only those with permission from the customer.  ""Not only does this project demonstrate how blockchain can allow institutions to retain control of and manage their own identity,"" said David Rutter, CEO of R3, ""but it also validates the design choices we made in our approach to privacy on Corda.""

42429291,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxFBh,1530273681,Keeping Ethereum's Promise: CryptoKitties Is Embracing Open-Source,"Call it an explosion of cute names for a cause.  Announced this week, CryptoKitties debuted a number of new initiatives that will further decentralize its popular ethereum app, which while largely passing under the radar, show the startup is making strides to give users rights. It's been the subject of criticism for the beloved game, which raised $12 million in March with the expectation it would loosen controls on its code in line with the larger crypto ethos.  Among a slew of updates, CryptoKitties is open-sourcing its API and smart contracts for gameplay in the KittyVerse – a virtual world of experiences including catfights, racing and accessories – through a developer toolkit. Plus, it's updated its user agreements to be more lenient and introduced a players' rights contract called the Nifty License.  ""CryptoKitties ... was always criticized for not being completely decentralized,"" Afri Schoedon, communications officer at the ethereum startup Parity, explained. ""I think CryptoKitties is doing a good job on finding the perfect path between decentralization and usability.""  He continued: The more you try to decentralize things, the more complicated it will be to actually use it.""  And CryptoKitties isn't just improving for end-users, but also for developers.  Take players like Candi Johnson, who have donated their time to build gameplay features like more complex battle options. Observers pointed out that CryptoKitties' old terms of service stipulated the team owned all graphics and elements of the app, but the Nifty License gives Johnson, and other cat owners, the legal rights to the intellectual property of each tabby.  As CryptoKitties fan Todd Goldberg tweeted: ""I have the right to delete my account and still take the asset with me. If this was a centralized game and I wanted to delete my account, I'd lose the asset.""  A traditional, centralized gaming studio might balk at the idea of letting users take their digital assets off the platform.  To the contrary, CryptoKitties co-founder Bryce Bladon said that diverse experiences with the items increase the whole ecosystem's value, plus, people looking to build alternative versions of CryptoKitties now don't ever need to worry about being sued.  Bladon told CoinDesk:  ""It's as much about removing ourselves as any form of a central authority as it is about doing so in a way that doesn't compromise the value of this game, of this product, and of this platform as a whole.""  Looking ahead, CryptoKitties plans to build on this progress by looking into decentralized data storage solutions like Filecoin and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Bladon said.  Stakeholder rights  Crypto collectibles are valuable only as long as they are unique or rare – so balancing owners' rights with some limitation on how these tokens are reproduced will be crucial to this ecosystem's success.  Bladon said he hopes the Nifty License can set an example for other non-fungible tokens, a broader class of crypto assets of which CryptoKitties is the most well-known, establishing a norm where the asset belongs to the user and not the platform.  ""That is why we have loosened up our terms of service. That is why we put this license out there,"" he said.  However, the Nifty License still appears to stipulate that owners can't apply the cat's image for commercial use – like a company logo – or sell it on a marketplace that doesn't verify ownership, such as Craigslist.  Limitations aside, Parity's Schoedon sees the Nifty License as a step in the right direction.  ""It would be good to just get away from this second-layer licensing issue by just saying 'whoever owns that token owns the attached art,'"" he said, referencing how commercial use and distribution clauses can get tricky.  Fortunately for gamers, the CryptoKitties team sees the Nifty License as a work in progress.  Looking ahead, the virtual playground will no longer be maintained solely by the startup. Case in point, Johnson's work on new CryptoKitties' experiences is not as a part of another open-source project or separate IP; instead, it's just for the love of the game.  ""The goal is to add value to the community and the kitties by giving them additional functionality. They're super cute as collectibles, and being able to play with them is fun,"" Johnson told CoinDesk.  Speaking to why making the application easier to use for developers will be beneficial to end users, Bladon said:  ""There is no more one-size-fits-all gameplay experience.""  Sustainable funding  Yet another initiative CryptoKitties announced this week is the Nifty Kitty Program, which gives opportunities for independent developer teams to apply for loans or grants to fund work for the community.  ""We are trying to build sustainable revenue options for people outside of the core CryptoKitties team,"" Bladon said.  These days, the startup's main source of revenue is charging 3.75 percent on all transactions done through CryptoKitties.co, such as buying a new kitty.  However, since the ethereum smart contract is open-source, other parties could theoretically give birth to new pets without that tax. Bladon said users with the skills to utilize the smart contract themselves have always been welcome to experiment.  ""The hash code would correlate to the cat's art and they would own it. It would be a legitimate CryptoKitty,"" Bladon said. ""I'm certain there is immense potential and a strong possibility for new and interesting ways for CryptoKitties to be made.""  The team has already selected a few external projects to receive loans or grants through the Nifty Kitty Program. Whatever those teams make won't be owned or managed by the original startup. This initiative aims to boost outside participation in building a cat-tastic ecosystem.  For Johnson, CryptoKitties was her first introduction to blockchain technology and she enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about it with a group of players who call themselves the KittyBattles team. Regardless of whether this team ever seeks monetary rewards for their creation, other developer teams might want that option.  The Nifty Kitty Program could be aligned with CryptoKitties' interest in decentralizing its processes. In the future, if CryptoKitties relinquishes control of the platform, the game would still need a vibrant developer community to continue iterating on the game to make it fun for users.  Speaking to this point, Bladon said:  ""Once a core concept is proven, developers can build on top of it. Players can sort of invest in the idea. Players and developers alike are elevated to stakeholders in it.""

42429287,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxF3h,1530270026,Alibaba Seeks to Eliminate Middlemen in Blockchain Payments Patent,"Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has been exploring the use of blockchain technology to speed up international payments, according to a new patent filing.  The patent application – ""A System and Method That Adjusts Account Balance on a Blockchain"" – was filed with the China State Intellectual Property Office in January of this year and was revealed on Friday.  Aimed to tackle the broad concept of adjusting account balances over a blockchain, the company explained how the system could be used to facilitate cross-border transactions that specifically involve a third-party payment vendor.  For instance, the document said that third-party payment services and their banking partners in different regions will all function as nodes to form the envisioned blockchain. Subsequently each node will maintain a ledger of user balances, reflecting accounts in third-party payment vendors' mobile wallets.  When a transaction request is initiated, the nodes would verify the user's account balance, taking into account any legal compliance procedures that must be followed – a process enforced by triggering smart contracts encoded to the blockchain, the patent says.  The nodes would then update the balance of the users sending and receiving the transacted amount in a decentralized way, thus eliminating the need for an intermediary and avoiding the resultant delays in transaction time, according to the document.  Although Alibaba didn't explain how or if it intends to apply the system commercially, the document was published just days after the company's payment affiliate Ant Financial announced the launch of a blockchain-based remittance service.  As reported by CoinDesk, Ant Financial said it is now using a blockchain-based system to allow Alipay users in Hong Kong to send money to residents in the Philippines via a third-party payment vendor, and with Standard Chartered as the banking partner.

42429304,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxFVh,1530265859,Bitcoin Price Risks Further Drop After Close Below $6K,"Bitcoin (BTC) could post new 2018 lows over the weekend, having found acceptance below key price support.  Despite signs of a possible corrective rally seen earlier yesterday, the leading cryptocurrency closed below $6,000 for the first time since November 12, signaling a downside break of a major support (February low).  While the bears had briefly pushed prices down to $5,755 (2018 low) last Sunday, a close below $6,000 had remained elusive. Now that prices sit below $6,000, the focus is back on the long-run bearish technical charts, which continue to call a move lower to $5,000.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $5,904 on Bitfinex – down 3.4 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies are also flashing red this morning. Names like EOS, litecoin (LTC), cardano (ADA) are reporting 6 percent drops on a 24-hour basis. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP are down 4 percent each, according to CoinMarketCap.  Despite the drop below support, bitcoin is still outperforming most other cryptocurrencies and is now at 11th place on the list of best performing top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  Clearly, investors have become more risk-averse, venturing out of high-risk cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin (and possibly then on to fiat currency). Consequently, the BTC dominance rate has climbed to 43 percent – the highest level since April 12.  Unfortunately for the bulls, the stage looks set for a further decline in bitcoin prices. Even so, the bears still need to keep their eyes open, as the unwinding of short positions ahead of month's end and more importantly, quarter's end, could again lift prices above $6,000.  Daily chart  The close below $6,000 support has bolstered the already bearish technical setup as indicated by the falling channel (series of lower highs and lower lows), downward sloping 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA).  Further, bitcoin is trading well below 50-day, 100-day and 200-day MAs, indicating that the long-term bias is bearish. What's more, the long-term averages are aligned one below the other and are trending south.  The bearish sentiment is quite an obstacle to overcome right now, as the bullish price-to-relative strength index (RSI) and price-to-money flow index divergences seen earlier this week failed to yield a notable corrective rally.  Other indicators are also pointing to a strong bearish sentiment. For instance, the Chaikin money flow (CMF), an oscillator that measures buying and selling pressure, is printing negative values for the fifth consecutive week.  The drop below $6,000 also adds credence to the pennant breakdown seen in the weekly chart and the bearish crossover between the 5-month and 10-month moving average.  View  Short-term outlook: Bearish, having closed below $6,000 yesterday.  Long-term outlook: Bearish, as indicated by the pennant breakdown on the weekly chart.  BTC could break below $5,755 (June 23 low) and could extend the decline towards the next major support located at $5,400 (November 12 low).  Only a high-volume falling-channel breakout would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.

42429288,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxF5h,1530262823,Kaspersky Warns on Rapid Spread of Malicious Crypto Miners,"Malicious actors are moving from ransomware to crypto-jacking, a leading cybersecurity firm reported Thursday.  Kaspersky Lab, the Russian cybersecurity company, said in a new report that ransomware attacks – where a malicious file locks a computer until a ransom is paid – have declined by nearly half as the perpetrators instead move to deploy crypto-mining malware instead. This is largely because crypto mining is now more profitable than ransomware, according to the report.  In a press release, Kaspersky explained that it compared data from April 2016–March 2017 with data from April 2017–March 2018. It found that ransomware that encrypts users' computers declined by nearly 44.6 percent from 2017 to 2018. In that same time period, crypto-mining malware rose by 44.5 percent.  Moreover, at the number of illicit mining instances jumped from 1.87 million in 2016 to roughly 2.7 million at the end of 2017, the company reported.  Kaspersky said that it expects these numbers to continue growing, particularly with the advance of mobile miners.  The report states:  ""It is highly likely that the additional growth of mining will come at the expense of mobile miners. For now, they are growing, but at a very steady pace. However, once criminals find a technological solution that makes the profits from mining on mobile devices equivalent to those from mining on PCs, mobile mining will quickly become equal.""  The report expressed particular concern for residents of China and India, which own roughly one third of all smartphones worldwide.  ""While ransomware has provided a potentially large but one-off income for its cybercriminals, miners will provide a lower, but longer lasting one. Last year we asked what tips the scales for cybercriminals? Today, this is no longer a question. Miners will keep spreading across the globe, attracting more people.""

Comprising the group are General Reinsurance Corporation and Hannover Re, the report said. Also involved in the project is China Re, the only reinsurance firm in China owned by the state and established by the country's Ministry of Finance.  According to a news report, the plan was announced at an event in Shanghai on Friday.  While the reinsurance firms will be mainly responsible for providing business support, the report indicated, ZhongAn Technology – the technology arm of China's first internet insurer ZhongAn – will lead the technological development.  The report said that, currently, a main challenge in the reinsurance industry in China is an information imbalance among parties, which ultimately leads to hikes in reinsurance costs and impedes the industry's long term growth.  To address this disparity, the group plans to create a distributed blockchain network that would allow different parties to view assets and transactions in a more syndicated manner, thus making the information flow more efficient and transparent.  The report also indicated that the joint work will be supervised by the Shanghai bureau of China's Insurance Regulatory Commission, the central regulator for the domestic insurance industry.  ZhongAn Technology has already carved out its space in the blockchain industry, having launched a platform called Anlink to power applications on the firm's blockchain.

42429301,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxFTh,1530252051,Consumers Fail Basic Q&A in Canadian Regulator's Crypto Quiz,"The securities regulator in Canada's Ontario province has raised concerns that public knowledge of cryptocurrency appears to be lacking, despite a growing interest in the nascent technology among local residents.  The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) published the results of a survey on Thursday that asked over 2,500 Ontario residents aged 18 or older about their awareness and knowledge of cryptocurrency and initial coin offerings.  The research, which took place in March, found that 5 percent of Ontarians currently hold cryptocurrency assets such as bitcoin and ethereum. While the percentage appears to be relatively small, the OSC said the figure still translates to over 500,000 residents in the province – a number that is ""sufficient to concern the OSC as a securities regulatory authority.""  Among the surveyed cryptocurrency holders, nearly half of them bought the assets because of their enthusiasm for the technology, while 42 percent did so in the hope of making profits by selling at a higher price.  Adding to the OSC's concerns is a result showing that, while the public are largely aware of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, most of them do not understand basics of the technology.  For instance, the survey shows that over 80 percent of respondents indicated they have heard of bitcoin. But when asked six questions about bitcoin, only about 30 percent could answer four or more correctly, and only three percent made no mistakes at all.  Further, for respondents who currently hold cryptocurrency assets, the survey said around 15 percent of them answered the six questions correctly.  The survey also indicated that 1.5 percent of the respondents said they had participated in an initial coin offering, meaning over 170,000 Ontarians had bought crypto assets through a token sale. The report added that around 10 percent of respondents had been solicited by a token offering scheme.  The OSC raised concerns that a majority of the respondents who had heard of cryptocurrency before taking the survey (67 percent) did not know who regulates ICOs and 18 percent of them believed ICOs are not regulated.  The survey is the OSC's latest effort to gauge public knowledge of the cryptocurrency industry as the regulator beefs up efforts to monitor token sales targeting Ontarian residents.  It also comes just a month after the regulator joined the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) to start working with counterparts in the U.S. to scrutinize ICOs projects.

42429300,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxFJh,1530244998,A $700 Million Cryptocurrency Called Ontology Is About to Go Live,"If all goes well, $700 million worth of cryptocurrency is about to find a new home.  That's because Shanghai-based Ontology, a project working closely with those behind the ""smart economy"" blockchain Neo, is expected to launch its live blockchain on June 30, a step that will find one of the top 20 crypto assets finally releasing its own proprietary technology.  Described as an enterprise-focused platform, Ontology is seeking to provide a high volume of fast and cheap transactions, all while helping businesses grapple with the thorny problems of interoperability and identity. As such, Ontology is one of several public blockchains catering to enterprise that have recently or will soon go live, Tron and Vechain being other notable contenders.  However, what might distinguish Ontology's claims is the experience of the team.  The protocol emerged from Neo, an ethereum challenger founded by Da Hongfei, who is also CEO of Onchain, which developed a private enterprise blockchain platform called DNA.  Meanwhile, Ontology's founder Li Jun told CoinDesk that his company and Neo are ""strategic technology partners,"" according to a spokesperson.  Ontology's corporate and technological genealogy might be difficult to keep track of, but the result is a pragmatic approach that appears to combine ambition with a lack of the ideological fussiness.  As Li said at a meetup in March:  ""When you want blockchain to become a mainstream industry like the internet today, you have to link to the real business scenario.""  For a while, Li added, it seemed that appealing to businesses meant building a permissioned framework like DNA, but it soon became clear that ""public blockchain is the future.""  If you already trust each other, he explained, ""blockchain is not necessary.""  Having adopted that stance, Onchain began work on a public platform that would meet some of businesses' most pressing needs: anchoring digital identities in the real world, allowing for flexibility in terms of technical design and preventing the creation of restrictive silos.  Two tokens, countless chains  Ontology has created a complex framework in its bid to satisfy all of these goals.  Similar to Neo (with NEO and GAS), the network will support two tokens. So far, only ONT exists. A token on the Neo blockchain, it was distributed to NEO holders in an airdrophttps://neo.org/blog/details/3061, half of which has been completed (the other half is set to occur after the mainnet launch this week).  Barring unforeseen obstacles, these tokens will migrate to a proprietary blockchain on June 30. Once there, they will serve as a governance mechanism, with users staking ONT in order to make network decisions.  Holders of ONT tokens will also begin to receive newly created ONG tokens, which will serve a similar role to Neo's GAS tokens, funding the execution of smart contracts. Each ONT will ""release"" ONG tokens for 18 years.  The more unusual aspect of Ontology's design is that it consists of multiple interoperable chains, anchored by a core blockchain (in a way that's perhaps not different from how ethereum envisions its ""sharding"" technology). According to those involved, his choice reflects Ontology's enterprise focus and the desire to give businesses flexibility in terms of designing a ledger – without shunting them into a silo.  Daniel Assab, Ontology's senior overseas market specialist, told CoinDesk:  ""In this industry, there's a lot of chains that want to cut up – cut their share in the ecosystem and try and take all of the competition in this area. But we want to cooperate with everyone, work with everyone, make this as compatible as possible.""  Speaking in March, Li noted that enterprise applications want to be able to customize. ""They have a lot of requirements,"" he said. ""They want their own blockchain with their governance model.""  Ontology's main chain will be based on a new consensus mechanism, VBFT – a combination of proof of stake, verifiable random function and Byzantine Fault Tolerance – which the team expects to be able to process over 3,000 transactions per second.  The network intends to be able to support multiple governance mechanisms, however, on its subsidiary chains.  People and things  Ontology has conceived this elaborate architecture in order to enable what its white paperhttps://ont.io/documents calls a ""decentralized trust ecosystem.""  ""We want to integrate different trust sources,"" Li said in March, and not just the scattered and self-referential digital aspects of trust – such as private keys – but real-world seats of trust: the legal system and physical assets such as real estate.  As he told CoinDesk, ""Ontology can serve as a bridge connecting the physical world and business.""  In other words, Ontology hopes to crack the problem of identity in the digital age, another goal being pursued by a number of blockchain projects. ""  But Ontology doesn't just want to help define digital identity for people, it wants to do this for digital items as well. To that end, it's partnered with Chain of Things (COT), which founder Wang Wen described as a ""universal basic platform for IoT [internet of things] and intelligent hardware"" based on Ontology's platform.  Ontology has also partnered with Contentos, a blockchain-based streaming video project.  Ontology's team is working on a number of implementations to be launched over the coming months and years, including an ID framework and marketplace, a reputation system, a ""trust search engine"" and a data exchange protocol. As with any self-respecting blockchain protocol, though, it aims to attract app developers to build out its ecosystem.  Panther, the founder of a community development group, told CoinDesk they are working on a C# software development kit and a Chrome plugin wallet, in addition to other projects.  Getting the swap right  Whether Ontology can follow through on all – or any – of its ambitions is an open question. But first it has to complete its transition to mainnet without leaving too many of its token holders behind.  Many users will have to complete the swap manually, leading to concerns that ""people could forget to do the token swap or … think, 'it's okay, I can hold,'"" Assab said.  Users who hold their ONT on certain exchanges, including Binance and Huobi, may have their tokens swapped automatically, but Ontology social media admins said they should ""refer to individual exchanges' policies.""  For users who do the swap manually, Ontology has posted a frequently-asked-questions page and plans to release a token swap guidance next week.  A likely headache for some users will be making sure they don't needlessly give up some of the ONT they're theoretically entitled to. The Ontology mainnet will accept only round numbers of tokens and disregard fractions. Even though the airdrop was for a fraction of ONT per NEO.  Users will have until October to complete the swap, but Assab said:  ""If that deadline needs to be changed, it will be changed.""  Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the business relationships between Da Hongfei, Ontology, Neo and Onchain. Da is not involved in Ontology, and neither Ontology nor Neo is a subsidiary of Onchain.
