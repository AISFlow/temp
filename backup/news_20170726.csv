42379643,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLhb,1501107005,No Panic: Cooler Heads Prevail as SEC Casts Shadow on Cooley ICO Event,"If anyone was panicking last night at a prominent meetup focused on initial coin offerings and token sales, they certainly weren't letting it show.  Scheduled to begin just 91 minutes after the SEC happened to release a landmark report on the legality of the novel fundraising method, Cooley, the host of the event and one of the sector's leading law firms, abbreviated its program to highlight its bullish view of blockchain and token technology.  In both the panel discussion and the Q&A session, optimism shined through.  Addressing a question about the market implications of the SEC report, Cooley partner Andy Roth told the crowd:  ""I would say [the report was] extremely positive... This is part of maturation and legitimization of the space. And so I think it's very positive. And it gives us more concrete guide posts to help clients organize themselves the right way.""  In response to the same question, Cooley special counsel Patrick Murck added that he believes the new guidance will provide market clarity – and legitimacy – for a use case of the technology long thought to be fringe.  ""If you to want to rewind the clock, and go back to the days of the DAO, when everybody is freewheeling and nobody cares, I guess it would be negative for that type of market. But for a sound market — that actually has a future — I think it's net positive,"" he told the audience.  Prior to joining Cooley, Murck previously served as the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, Bitcoin's earliest non-profit advocacy group.  Investors confident  The sentiment among the audience, which included cryptocurrency investors, lawyers, and developers, generally reflected the optimistic tone of the panel.  James Robinson IV, an investor in blockchain startups Chain, Ripple, 21 Inc, and BitPay, was one attendee who took this tone, calling it a ""net positive.""  ""Defining the goal posts is important. Where you have uncertainty, anything that gives guidance is by definition positive,"" he told CoinDesk.  Still, he foresees the extent of any impact as fundamentally limited given the size of the addressable market.  Robinson added, in a more cautious coda:  ""On the other hand, we're living in the 21st Century. Digital boundaries are not physical borders. And it's very difficult for the SEC to regulate a server setup in Switzerland.""  Regulatory reaction  Among people familiar with the regulatory community, attendees largely agreed the formal government guidance marked a significant positive milestone for the developing technology.  Jeff Bandman, a former Cravath, Swaine & Moore attorney who also served as special counsel to the chairman at Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for example, saw it as a notable milepost.  ""It's a Digital Marbury v. Madison, in the sense that the SEC is asserting that ICOs are a security, which has important implications.""  Bandman, who is now Principal at Bandman Advisors, also provided additional color around the market implications of the report:  ""I think it's a positive. It's a step in the maturation of these markets. The capacity for capital formation here is truly eye opening. Investors have greater confidence when there is legal certainty.""  In reference to the ambiguity surrounding the emerging distinctions in the token and cryptocurrency space, Bandman added, ""This wasn't a one-size-fits-all solution. The facts and circumstances matter.""  The facts and circumstances Bandman alluded to will likely include emerging distinctions around when a token is considered a security, and when it functions as a 'utility coin', a kind of consumer credit that can be exchanged for network goods or services.

42379634,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLYn,1501103839,The Big News Behind the BTC-e Arrest and Mt Gox Connection,"BTC-e, Mt Gox, Bitcoinica.  Those who are new to bitcoin and blockchain technology may have been surprised today by an influx of strange companies and persons that have long been out of the mainstream news. Yet, for long-time industry technologists and observers, the developments are actually a major breakthrough with serious implications.  Not only does it shed light on notorious cases of massive bitcoin thefts, but it also connects one of bitcoin's longest-running legal efforts (in which creditors lost hundreds of millions in bitcoin) to its murkiest exchange long suspected of enabling criminal activity.  In short, the assertions being made by law enforcement and independent analysts (if true) could pull back the curtain on the earliest days of bitcoin's history.  For those who weren't following the blow-by-blow, we've assembled the timeline, implications and unknowns below.  To begin, here are the major players:  BTC-e: Once one of bitcoin's largest exchanges, little is known about BTC-e despite the fact that it has operated one of the most consistently available ways to exchange fiat currency for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC-e does not take customer information, and its location and employee structure are unknown (though it has long been suspected of operating out of eastern Europe).  Mt Gox: Likely a more familiar name, the defunct Japan-based exchange was the victim of a massive hack in 2014 that saw millions in customer funds stolen. Since then, creditors are still largely fighting for compensation, and its former CEO is now on trial in Japan. At one point in 2013, Mt Gox was responsible for the majority of bitcoin exchange volume.  WizSec: An independent and informal investigative outlet based in Japan, WizSec is a team of blockchain analysts and Mt Gox creditors who have long been investigating the exchange's demise. While it has provided information to law enforcement in the past, this responsibility has now largely passed to Chainalysis and Kraken, two more well-capitalized bitcoin startups.  The timeline  This cast of characters came to a head again this morning when news broke that an individual, said to be a native Russian, was arrested in Greece on money laundering charges connected to the use of bitcoin.  Since then, it's been a fast-developing story.  The prelude    BTC-e announces on July 25 it is undertaking “unplanned maintenance in [its] data center.""  Two hours after that initial tweet, the exchange tweets that its engineers ""are still looking into the issue."" While no statement was given on an exact time at which it would come back online, the exchange said ""we hope to get back online soon,"" with more updates promised.  A similar tweet is issued roughly five hours later, effectively reiterating that prior message.  Arrest news breaks    International news organizations, including the Associated Press, reported earlier today that a Russian man was arrested in Greece. The first details to emerge implicate the then-as-yet-named individual in a ""$4 billion"" laundering scheme involving bitcoins.  News services went on to say that the individual in question is named Alexander Vinnik. It's further added, per Reuters, that the laundering took place through a ""bitcoin"" platform.  As these details emerged, users – taking to social media to voice concern over the potential closure of BTC-e – began connecting Vinnik to one of the exchange’s leaders, named ""Alexander,"" who spoke with CoinDesk in a 2014 interview.  The next detail to drop, with Reuters citing sources close to BTC-e, was that Vinnik is ""connected"" to the exchange, though it later amended its article to state that he is ""suspected of being the anonymous mastermind behind one of the world's oldest crypto-currency exchanges.""  This information was reportedly derived from a US arrest warrant that was then executed by Grecian authorities.  A source with knowledge of the investigation later told CoinDesk that the arrest warrant remains under seal at this time.  WizSec releases initial findings  At roughly 18:00 UTC, WizSec released a report which stressed that, at this time, there's nothing to definitively connect Vinnik or a related alias to the theft of funds from Mt Gox, but rather, the connection is with the subsequent laundering of that money.  In interview, the firm said its newly published work was not timed to coincide with today's news events – rather, it was inspired by it.  WizSec told CoinDesk that the news today rather added a missing piece to its investigation – namely, the connection between the Mt Gox heist and BTC-e. Instead, its focus was on tracing stolen Mt Gox coins across the blockchain to a network of wallets they had long known were involved in money laundering.  Notably, this network of wallets was also found to have contained coins connected to a hack on Mt Gox in 2011, as well as a hack on an exchange called Bitcoinica in 2012. Those accounts, according to the researchers, could be tied to an online account ""WME,"" which the firm identified as being owned by person named Alexander Vinnik prior to today’s developments.  The finding allowed WizSec to add new context to another clue – the fact that some of the coins connected to the theft seemed to go through a unique avenue within BTC-e's public wallet architecture.  According to the firm, some coins went directly to what they believe was a ""second-tier wallet,"" an irregularity that wasn't previously explored.  The finding, coupled with Vinnik's alleged connection to the exchange, prompted the firm to pen the blog post.  What's not clear  Despite quickly snowballing, some details about the story remain unclear.  What was Vinnik's role at BTC-e?    Perhaps the biggest detail yet to be confirmed is the exact nature of Vinnik's connection to BTC-e. Though Reuters, citing sources, says that he is believed to be the ""mastermind"" of the cryptocurrency exchange, the relevant arrest warrant has yet to be made available.  Authorities have also not commented publicly on the arrest nor clarified Vinnik's relationship with BTC-e. Nor is it entirely clear when Vinnik may face a court hearing on the charges for which he has been arrested.  US authorities are said to be pursuing an extradition of Vinnik. Yet The Associated Press reported that ""under Greek law, he can be held for up to two months until the request is examined,"" meaning that it may be some time before Vinnik is brought to the US.  How involved was BTC-e in the laundering?  It's unclear whether BTC-e found face larger repercussions or if more arrests could be made.  While BTC-e has a long history of silence and secrecy, it's never been proven that the operation itself is a criminal enterprise, though this news would go a long way toward establishing suspicions.  Will Vinnik name names?  It's also unclear whether the arrest of Vinnik will lead to details about who could have been behind the Mt Gox and Bitcoinica thefts.  Should Vinnik be willing to provide details about the individual, it's possible that a suspect could be identified who could face criminal charges, shedding light on a long obtuse part of the story.  It’s a development that also comes as the trial of Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles is underway. Karpeles appeared in court earlier this month, pleading not guilty to embezzlement and data manipulation charges.  Is BTC-e finished?  There's a big emphasis on conditionals here, given that we don’t currently know whether authorities are moving to shut down the exchange or seize connected assets. However, recent dark market crackdowns suggest that law enforcement officials are taking an aggressive stance that could extend to BTC-e.  What we do know is that, earlier today, BTC-e’s official Twitter account issued a statement saying that it would come back online in the next five to 10 days.  ""Update2: at the moment we are working on the restoration of service. Approximate terms from 5 to 10 days. Thanks for your understanding #btce,"" the exchange’s account tweeted.  Given that BTC-e representatives have not responded to a request for comment by press time, only time will tell if that pledge comes true.  Wolfie Wei-Zhao and Stan Higgins contributed reporting.

42379629,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLPz,1501095853,Investor Tim Draper Calls on SEC to 'Grandfather' ICOs Into Compliance,"Investor Tim Draper is calling for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to exempt certain initial coin offering (ICO) projects from the repercussions of its ruling that tokens can be captured under its definition for securities.  In a Facebook post today, Draper thanked the SEC for its guidance, but sought to call on the agency to make exemptions for projects that have issued or will issue tokens before October 30, arguing this would be ""in the spirit of clarity and encouraging innovation.""  Famed for purchasing nearly 30,000 bitcoins at auction in 2014, Draper has been among the earliest and most vocal supporters of bitcoin and blockchain innovation. As such, it was perhaps not surprising when Draper invested was again one of a few early investors in decentralized projects seeking funding by use of the method.  In the post, Draper goes on to recommend a series of factors the SEC should consider so as to send the right message to innovators he fears may otherwise relocate to other jurisdictions.  Draper recommends:    ""1. If the purpose of a token is for investment, it must register with the SEC.      2. If the purpose of a token is for societal transformation, and all proceeds go to the support and development of the token, it need not register.    3. If the purpose of a token is to raise money for a company, and the money is used to support the company, it must register with the SEC.""    Draper's investments in the nascent sector have so far included a self-governing blockchain project (Tezos), a liquidity mechanism for smart contracts (Bancor) and a decentralized tool for fighting email spam (Credo).

42379637,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLbJ,1501083822,BTC-e Connected to Bitcoin Money Laundering Arrest in Greece,"One of the world's oldest bitcoin exchanges has been offline for more than a day – and breaking news reports are now connecting the outage to an arrest this morning in Greece.  Amid the outage, bitcoin users have been moving to connect the two stories, which suggests one of the operators of BTC-e, a bitcoin exchange long infamous for its mysterious operations and lack of public disclosures, has been apprehended.  Among the clues that has emerged is that one of the administrators of the site, known only as Alexander, shares a name with the individual arrested in Greece, 38-year-old Alexander Vinnik, who authorities allege laundered ""$4 billion in cash...through a bitcoin platform since 2011.""  Adding to the context is that BTC-e has been largely silent or non-descriptive about its issues. The last tweet from the exchange, for example, was 20 hours ago, when the exchange said that it ""still continue[s] to perform our unscheduled ongoing maintenance.""  BTC-e had previously said that it was doing data center work and that access would become limited. The site remains inaccessible, though a maintenance page is currently visible along with a feed of the exchange's recent tweets.  Though BTC-e has gone offline in the past, this particular outage has caused particular concern for some given overnight reports that coins connected to BTC-e wallets were moved.  A representative for BTC-e did not respond to a request for comment via Skype.  Vinnik, according to reports, was detained for money laundering, conspiracy and transacting in cash obtained through illegal means. US authorities are reportedly seeking to extradite him based on a warrant drafted earlier this year in California. As of press time, no public records were available regarding the warrant.  According to Reuters, citing unnamed sources, Vinnik is ""connected to [the] BTC-e cryptocurrency exchange.""  The arrest comes amid a broader international crackdown that has resulted in the closures of AlphaBay and Hansa, two of the world's most popular dark markets.

42379639,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLgL,1501074020,Bitcoin Cash: Why It's Forking the Blockchain And What That Means,"Bitcoin's scaling debate finally seems to be shaking out, but some users aren't happy with the results.  After a few years of debate, it was perhaps to be expected that at least some were going to come away empty-handed. Controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x tried to remedy this by joining two code change ideas – the code optimization Segregated Witness (SegWit) and a block size increase.  Today, SegWit is just a couple of steps away from activating on bitcoin, but some bitcoin users are unhappy about the outcome.  Others who originally backed the Segwit2x proposal appear to be losing confidence in an eventual block size increase and are now taking matters into their own hands by making their own version of bitcoin – and they're doing so on a short timeline.  On August 1, at precisely 12:20 UTC, the group claims that they will split off from bitcoin, creating a new cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash.  Developer Calin Culianu, who's contributing code to an implementation of Bitcoin Cash, is one user who doesn't like SegWit, suspecting that others feel the same way.  Culianu told CoinDesk:  ”If the Segwit2x agreement fails to implement the 2x part, which is not entirely unreasonable, and only ends up being being basically SegWit without the 2x, many miners will likely defect to Bitcoin Cash.""  What is Bitcoin Cash?  So, what is it? And how does it differ from bitcoin?  There are two main changes of note:  It increases the block size to 8 MB.  It removes SegWit, a code change that might activate on the bitcoin blockchain by the end of August.  Some, including a few of the project's supporters, call Bitcoin Cash an ""altcoin,"" a term that usually denotes a fork of the software that creates a new cryptocurrency, with its own market.  Indeed, the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $461, meaning it's worth about 18% of bitcoin's current price of $2,568, in an already-open futures market.  Unlike other altcoins, though, Bitcoin Cash's transaction history would be the same as bitcoin's – at least up until the point of the split. So, if and when Bitcoin Cash splits off, users would have bitcoin on both blockchains.  Another difference is the project says it will support multiple implementations of its software, a move that's not surprising given the criticism that Bitcoin Core's software is too dominant on the bitcoin network.  BitcoinABC  is the first software to implement the Bitcoin Cash protocol, but the goal is for there to be many implementations.  Culianu said that both Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic, other implementations that aim to increase bitcoin’s block size, are working on a version compatible with Bitcoin Cash.  These might or might not be ready for August 1.  Who's involved?  So far, most bitcoin companies, mining pools, users and bitcoin developers seem uninterested in the effort. Yet, there are some eager supporters.  Beijing-based mining firm ViaBTC, which boasts roughly 4% of bitcoin’s computing power, is the clear ringleader.  The firm, which also operates an exchange, has become the first to list the cryptocurrency and also has plans to launch a new mining pool dedicated solely to Bitcoin Cash. (Though, so far, it's not clear how much of its 4% mining hashrate it will commit to the effort.)  Asked if he believed Segwit2x would fulfill its roadmap, CEO Haipo Yang responded: ""I doubt it.""  Further, Bitcoin Cash has attracted support from some users who want a block size increase, as well as developers of other proposals such as Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited.  What might be more surprising, though, is who's not involved.  Even former supporters, including mining firms Bitcoin.com and Bitmain, seem hesitant to back the effort. For now, they remain committed to controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x.  Mining company Bitmain even inspired Bitcoin Cash. Yet, the firm said that they only planned on going through with making the switch under certain conditions. Still, the firm might support both Segwit2x and Bitcoin Cash in the future.  In a PSA statementhttps://www.bitcoin.com/public-service-announcement, Bitcoin.com said that it will allow miners in its pool to choose if they want to mine the Bitcoin Cash token BCC.  For now, though, it will mine on Segwit2x chain, though it said it ""will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively"" if the block size increase part of SegWit, scheduled for roughly three months from now, falls through.  Wait, but why?  There are a few reasons users and mining pools might like to break off from bitcoin:  These users want an increase in bitcoin's block size parameter, and believe that the cryptocurrency's future depends on it.  SegWit is likely going to activate soon and some users want to avoid the feature.  There's a possibility that Segwit2x's block size parameter increase will ultimately fall through.  This mix of ideological and technical reasons was also on display in conversations with users.  When asked by CoinDesk what BitcoinABC's goal is, Culianu responded:  ""To save bitcoin. We want to scale bitcoin up so that it won't die. It's already a bit sick and dying.""  What's different here?  Many other efforts over the last couple of years have said they would split off from bitcoin, if they gained enough support from those operating the computers that secure the network. But, to date, no group has actually carried through with this plan so far.  Bitcoin Cash might be unique in that it's actually committing to a deadline to split bitcoin into two, and that deadline is less than a week away.  If miners and users indeed go ahead with the split, it would mark the first time a cryptocurrency split off from bitcoin, carrying with it bitcoin’s transaction history.  Like past efforts intended to replace the bitcoin used today with a new bitcoin, however, Bitcoin Cash has the same goal, but it seems willing to wait and see if users join the effort.  Rather than call it bitcoin, ViaBTC, as well as a group of bitcoin companies in China, signed an agreement to label it a ""competitive currency,"" not the ""real"" bitcoin.  The move could set up the split to happen more quickly, as in the past exchanges have expressed confusion over how to handle a fork.  What's next?  If a new cryptocurrency splits off from the main bitcoin network, it will mark a first. So, some users are curious to see what happens.  Still, without much support from miners and users, it might not end up having that much of an impact on the course of the main network.  Nonetheless, it might if be worth watching if the second half of Segwit2x falls through. That's when it might see some more supporters.  Culianu, for example, concluded on an optimistic note:  ”My secret gut feeling is Bitcoin Cash may surprise all of us. It is not entirely impossible that it will be the de-facto bitcoin after a few months. The much roomier 8 MB block space is attractive.""

42379624,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLMD,1501065197,Veritaseum Founder Claims $8 Million in ICO Tokens Stolen,"Yet another initial coin offering (ICO) project is claiming that it has been the victim of a hack.  Just a week after a prominent ICO saw its sale disrupted, the team behind Veritaseum, the issuer of a cryptocurrency called VERI, is claiming 36,000 of its tokens were stolen and subsequently exchanged for ether.  After one user posted a screen capture of Veritaseum founder Reggie Middleton mentioning the hack on Slack, Middleton later confirmed the theft. There, he said the hackers ""dumped"" the tokens within a few hours and without the public knowing about the hack.  Based on the address of the hacker or hackers that Middleton located in his post, all the stolen tokens were exchanged on EtherDelta, a decentralized trading platform, of which 80 percent of the volume is in VERI. The exchange only supports the VERI to ETH trading pair.  According to the transaction time, nearly $8 million worth of VERI were traded to ETH, the consecutive large sell orders for which led to a major drop of VERI exchange price to ETH.  Middleton said in the statement that while the hack is unfortunate, the stolen amount was less than 0.07% of the total supply of tokens. In the meantime, he touted an ""impressive"" demand for VERI amid the flash liquidation by the hacker, which bolstered the token price.  Middleton later responded to CoinDesk, claiming all the stolen tokens came from the company as opposed to investors who participated in its ICO in April this year. According to Veritaseum's website, the tokens are being used to build a P2P software for capital market trading.  ""Since the address is ours, and we did not authorize the withdrawal, we came to the conclusion that it was hacked,"" Middleton said.  Data on Etherscan.io shows that the 36,000 tokens were taken out from the origin address alleged to belong to Veritaseum, and transferred through six additional newly created addresses before being liquidated.  Two hours after the claimed hack, the same address also shifted out an even larger amount – over 96 million VERI. However, Middleton said they emptied the wallet as soon as they sensed a potential threat.  He continued to say that a supplier of the company was compromised, and that this led to the hack, but refused to offer additional details such as the name the company or the attack vector.

Senior White House advisor Jared Kushner submitted a statement on Monday ahead of a meeting with members of the US Senate, who are investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election. Kushner, a New York real estate scion who is also married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, flatly denied that the allegations against him and the campaign.  Kushner's statement contained a notable aside, dating back to the end of October, when he is said to have received an email from someone using the moniker ""Guccifer400"" – a reference to the Romanian hacker who infiltrated the email accounts of several US and Romanian officials, among others.  The person, according to Kushner, threatened to publish information regarding Trump's tax returns – a subject of interest during the campaign given that he was the sole candidate to opt not to release his returns – unless Kushner paid 52 bitcoins, an amount worth roughly $37,000 at then-current prices.  Despite passing along the threat to the Secret Service, Kushner explained, nothing ultimately came of it.  ""I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all travelling [sic] on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply -- which is what I did,"" he wrote. ""The sender never contacted me again.""

As profiled by Business Insider, the movement is in line with Jafari's earlier analysis, reported on June 13, when she suggested the price would temporarily drop below $2,000, only to then turn bullish.  Indeed, since surpassing its all-time high over $3,000 on June 12, the bitcoin price tumbled to as low as $1,836 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Shortly thereafter, it hit a one-month high across major exchanges amid progress on its technical roadmap.  With this much foreseen, Jafari now believes the price of bitcoin is in for a period of fluctuation, at least until a new wave of price growth begins.  ""Anything above 3,000 (June 13th high) will suggest potential to have already started wave V, which again has a minimum target at 2,988 and scope to reach 3,691,"" Jafari wrote in the note.

42400226,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxQA,1501058281,ICOs: Foolish Mania or Market Discovery? (They Might Be Both),"Ariel Deschapell is a full stack javascript developer teaching at the Ironhack coding bootcamp in Miami, and a recent Henry Hazlitt fellow in Digital Development at the Foundation for Economic Education.  In this opinion piece, Deschapell examines the burgeoning blockchain token ecosystem, arguing that it's perhaps best viewed as a continuation of the market discovery an invention like bitcoin necessitates.      After a historic cryptocurrency price run-up, a question continues to hang in the air – is there a larger correction looming?  To examine this question, we must first look at the drive to a $100 billion cryptocurrency market capitalization, and the factors that created it – these include the countless initial coin offerings (ICOs), ether's rapid price escalation, and now, the possible (maybe imminent) activation of Segregated Witness on bitcoin.  First off, it's best to restate that many commentators have observed the number and size of such ICOs, and the perceived speculative greed driving them, and have raised the alarm.  Perhaps the project that's most symbolic of the bubble for those in this camp is Tezos, which recently broke crowdfunding records by raising $232 million with little more than a white paper and a website.  Defenders will point to past bull runs, which also had their own alarm-raisers.  Here, I'd like to point out a single important and little appreciated difference: In every prior bubble new capital was coupled with an inherent skepticism of the technology and industry itself.  This has undoubtedly changed.  New optimism  Today, there is little if any talk of the inherent instability of cryptocurrency growth, or bearish outlooks on its long-term future by critics.  Instead, all we are seeing are simple and reasonable conclusions that perhaps the recent influx of capital occurred much too quickly. Blockchain and blockchain tokens, however, are increasingly recognized as permanent fixtures of our world.  While the change in rhetoric has been subtle and gradual, we are actually experiencing a significant shift in the mainstream perception of cryptocurrency.  The value of public blockchain networks is, for the first time, being implicitly admitted by the financial status quo, who seem to be collectively accepting cryptocurrency as a new asset class.  The tune and actions from major industry players in 2014, like Goldman Sachs, was drastically different. Rather than just performing research on the technology, and dismissing it, we are now seeing cryptocurrencies themselves becoming the next target of hedge funds and other investment vehicles.  In 2014, the question was whether public blockchains and distributed cryptocurrencies were here to stay. That has been answered.  Where we're headed  Yet, there are endless more questions that necessarily follow.  What blockchain architectures are most secure and useful? How secure do they have to be? How many different cryptocurrencies are necessary or practical? How should they be implemented, and which protocols will actually stand the test of time?  These are all questions to which there are plenty of competing answers.  It's no surprise then that ICO investors are betting on every possible configuration of the technology, as it's a puzzle to extreme specialists, let alone the average person, how this will all play out.  The cryptocurrency industry finds itself at a formative point, and the growing pains will involve individual price corrections and many more individual failures and short term volatility.  But all the while, the ecosystem is in the midst of building crucial infrastructure. Most importantly: the knowledge foundation and market confidence in what works and what doesn't.  This is not in spite of the inflated short-term valuation of ICOs, but in fact in large part because of it.  Foreseeable outcome  Yes, many ICOs are likely to fail.  Given the unprecedented nature of cryptocurrency and novel dynamics of the ecosystem, it's reasonable to assume also that their failure rate will be much higher than that of even the typical tech startup. But just as no rational and professional economist considers the failure rate of new startups a problematic market failure, the likelihood that many ICOs will fail is not an issue for the ecosystem.  To the contrary, it's a positive and essential step to building the foundational knowledge and and market confidence that the cryptocurrency industry needs in order to continue to become established. Just as miners maximize their profits to secure the bitcoin blockchain, traders too attempt to optimize returns, and by extension, add long-term value to ecosystem.  Although, how they do this may not be immediately apparent. Without trial and error, there can be no collective learning and ultimately no economic growth.  Rather than careless and naive boondoggles, recent ICOs can instead be viewed as both a bullish investment in, and broad insurance for, the long-term future of public blockchains. There are many disagreements as to how that future could look like, and thus capital is naturally being funneled into various competing visions.  But this isn't a sign of a market with fundamental long-term problems. It's a sign of a market with a robust future not riding on the success of any single project, idea or team.  On maximalism  Those most likely to scoff at this perspective are self-proclaimed ""bitcoin maximalists"" who are supremely confident of the superiority of a single blockchain solution in the long term (naturally bitcoin, albeit with sidechains and additional protocol layers to extend usage and functionality).  Still, even if maximalists are indeed correct in their assumptions and long-term projections, the market can't and won't follow them to their conclusions until it has attempted many different courses of action.  Like the living things they are extensions of, markets operate and learn solely through feedback. It's only through competitive trial and error that market hypotheses and theories are vindicated or discredited. It's by this mechanism that the most accurate mental models of the world come to be validated and shared collectively as common knowledge, as the economist Friedrich Hayek helped to so brilliantly articulate.  This is the most important function ICOs provide: validating what works and what doesn't and guiding the ecosystem's development as a result.  Seeding the earth  In other words, let a thousand ICOs seed the Earth.  The benefit of the increased diversity and competition that follows is a higher rate of experimentation and learning, at the cost of temporarily added market noise, confusion, and volatility. These are costs which are best incurred by the ecosystem as early as possible, and for cryptocurrency this is still only the nascent beginning.  We'll continue to see individual ups and downs and wins and losses. But in the meantime the necessary intellectual and technical foundations are slowly being solidified to make for a much larger impact on the global economy.  From here many different futures are possible.  The new blockchain protocols which seek to improve upon bitcoin or solve problems it leaves unaddressed may all ultimately fail, and simply leave a more dominant and validated bitcoin vision than ever. Or some may succeed and create real value in the medium to long term, and perhaps even compete with bitcoin if they are able to solve even a subset of the ambitious problems many of them claim to.  While high levels of skepticism for new ICO projects are warranted and absolutely needed given the almost non-existent barrier to entry, you can never eliminate the possibility of a new real innovation appearing out of nowhere, just as bitcoin itself did.  Regardless of the outcome of the current mania, and the exact mix of winners and losers which appear, the only thing that can be said for certain is that the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole can only come out of it more confident and established than ever.
