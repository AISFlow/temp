42386966,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBW83b,1622928138,Polygon's MATIC Token Ended May Up 120% Despite Bitcoin's Price Crash,"Surging usage of Polygon Network's Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution allowed that platform's MATIC token to largely escape the fate of other cryptocurrencies in May brought down by crash in the price of bitcoin.      MATIC, currently ranked 18th as per market capitalization by Messari, rallied 120% in May even as bitcoin fell by 35%. Ether, polkadot, cardano, XRP and decentralized finance (DeFi) blue-chips suffered bigger losses, pushing the total market capitalization of the crypto universe down by 24%.      MATIC was able to withstand the the worst effects of the downdraft thanks to Polygon's soaring usage and constant growth in the congestion and high costs that plague the DeFi-dominating Ethereum blockchain, as analytics firm IntoTheBlock mentioned in its research note published on June 2.      ""Throughout 2021, Ethereum fees skyrocketed up to 845% compared to the year before; currently, a transaction on the network costs around $4.819,"" IntoTheBlock said. ""On the other hand, transacting on the Polygon network only costs around $0.001 to transfer $200.""      As such, several DeFi protocols flocked to Polygon – a sidechain running tangent to Ethereum's blockchain, offering high transaction output and relatively low costs without compromising security. Scaling refers to increasing the throughput of the system, as measured by transactions per second.      MATIC's impressive performance proves a cryptocurrency backed by strong fundamentals can largely hold its own against a price slide in bitcoin. As such, the token could continue to appreciate in the coming months unless Ethereum sees a sustained drop in transaction costs or usage.      Ethereum rivals including Polkadot, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain would also seem ready to gain. However, as Polygon is a sidechain that works in conjunction with Ethereum, it benefits from Ethereum's dominating network effects and thus holds an edge over blockchains that seek to replace the market-leading giant.      Perhaps that's why tokens powering Ethereum rivals Polkadot, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain suffered double-digit losses in May even as MATIC extended a four-month run of gains. A recent string of flash loan attacks on products built on the Binance Smart Chain likely didn't help the reputation of the would-be Ethereum dethroners either.      While MATIC proved remarkably resistant in the face of bitcoin's price crash, it wasn't completely immune. The majority of gains happened in the first half of the month, before the biggest cryptocurrency fell from $58,000 to $30,000 in the eight days to May 19 on concerns regarding the negative environmental impact of crypto mining and China regulatory fears. MATIC's price hit an all-time high of $2.72 for a year-to-date gain of 248% before bitcoin's troubles took their toll.    Rally accompanied by network growth    Before MATIC began giving back some its gains in mid-May, the token's performance was rising in line with the soaring usage of the protocol itself. During the month, the number of average daily active users on Polygon surged by 285% from 7,500 to 28,873, according to blockchain data provider Covalent. The sidechain became busier than ever as more users accessed DeFi via the low-cost scaling solution.      Per Covalent, the number of unique addresses using Aave protocol on Polygon shot up by 156% to 15,769 in May. The decentralized money market giant received over $5 billion in liquidity via the layer 2 scaling solution. Aave announced integration with Polygon in April.      Meanwhile, average daily unique users on Polygon-based decentralized exchange QuickSwap rose by 302% to over 10,000, and the liquidity on the platform increased by 68% to $924.78 million, Covalent said in an email.      ""The almost fee-less trading Polygon offers offered a breath of fresh air to seasoned DeFi traders that have been suffering under the weight of extremely high gas prices [Ethereum fees] for some months now,"" Tim Frost, CEO of Yield app, said while explaining reasons for Polygon and QuickSwap's success.    Looking ahead    Polygon's performance has led the protocol to receive validation from prominent investors like Mark Cuban. Further, the token has been added to the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index (BITX) with a weightage of 1.03%, according to LiveMint. The index is managed by Bitwise Asset Management, a crypto asset manager with $1.5 billion worth of assets under manager.      ""The early rally seemed to be driven by a mix of savvy DeFi users and retailers, but now popular investors like Mark Cuban are publicly diving in,"" Nick Mancini, chief community officer at Trade The Chain, told CoinDesk.      Cuban confirmed being an investor in Polygon on May 26, but refrained from disclosing the size or composition of his stake. However, Polygon's co-founder Sandeep Nailwal told Economic Times on May 27 that his project received a ""sizable investment"" from the billionaire entrepreneur and not through a simple purchase of tokens.      ""I was a Polygon user and find myself using it more and more,"" Cuban said in an email to CoinDesk at the time. His website describes Polygon as ""the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development.""      Trade The Chain's Mancini said he expects more institutional inflows into DeFi assets and a continued rally in MATIC, albeit after some downside in June. The token has come under pressure this week, falling by 15% to $1.58. Still, prices are up 8,800% year to date.      Also read: Money Reimagined: The Power of Community      Yield CEO Tim Frost said Polygon and QuickSwap's momentum might slow once the Ethereum 2.0 (proof-of-stake upgrade) is completed. Developers estimate that the upgrade will happen by the end of this year or early 2022. After that, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin plans to implement the sharding upgrade to ease congestion and bring down fees.      However, Polygon CEO Sandeep Nailwal said he's confident that layer 2 scaling solutions will prevail even after the upgrade allows Ethereum transaction costs to decline.      ""Ethereum 2.0 will become 64 times more scalable than Ethereum is now, but the demand is 1,000 times than where we are.

42386969,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBW84r,1622926290,President of El Salvador Says He’s Submitting Bill to Make Bitcoin Legal Tender,"El Salvador is developing a bill to recognize bitcoin as legal tender, according to President Nayib Bukele. In a videotaped announcement shown Saturday, he said he will submit the bill next week.      Zap's Jack Mallers announced the news at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami. He said his company is working with Bukele to implement a plan.      The bill must still be reviewed by the country's legislative assembly. But with the populist Bukele’s upstart political party in firm control of that body, approval seemed all but assured Saturday afternoon.      The bill's approval would likely make El Salvador the first nation to adopt a bitcoin standard. Its full text was not immediately available.      “As of now, El Salvador is set to be the first bitcoin country,” Mallers said, “and the first country to make bitcoin legal tender and treat it as a world currency and have bitcoin on their reserves.”      But it is not yet clear what being “the first bitcoin country” will mean for the fiscally unstable and oppressively poor Central American nation, where 70% of residents lack a banking account. El Salvador's gross domestic product was $24.6 billion in 2020, according to Statista.      The 39-year-old Bukele claimed in recorded remarks his plan will have short-term benefits for thousands of unbanked individuals. He also claimed it will generate jobs.      “And in the medium and long term, we hope that this decision can help us push humanity, at least a tiny bit, into the right direction,” Bukele said.    Inflation angst    Mallers framed Bukele’s announcement as pushing back against “unprecedented monetary expansion.” He placed particular blame on the U.S Federal Reserve for “crushing emerging markets” such as El Salvador’s dollarized economy by printing greenbacks ad nauseum.      A brief excerpt of what appeared to be Bukele’s bill harped on a similar theme: ""Central banks are increasingly taking actions that may cause harm to the economic stability of El Salvador.""      The excerpt continued:    “In order to mitigate the negative impact from central banks, it becomes necessary to authorize the circulation of a digital currency with a supply that cannot be controlled by any central bank and is only altered in accord with objective and calclable criteria.”    Bitcoin, the decentralized, hard-capped, stateless, decade-old digital currency, would appear to fit that criteria.      El Salvador’s plan sits in stark contrast to a competing vision of money gaining traction among central banks. About 80% are studying central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in a global push to make fiat more compatible with the digital economy.      None, however, have seriously considered implementing that through a cryptocurrency beyond their control.    El Salvador experience    Mallers’ Strike, a payments app built on Bitcoin's Lightning Network, has been on the ground in El Salvador this year, with Mallers claiming to have onboarded 20,000 Salvadorans a day during the app’s peak activity in the country.    Read more: Strike Launches Bitcoin Lightning Payment App in El Salvador; Full EU Support Is Next    In an emotional speech, Mallers made it clear that Zap's mission is to serve those in economies he believes are most affected by central bank monetary inflation.

According to a Twitter post by Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu, accounts not involved in ads of exchanges have not been blocked.  Still, reports of the block, which hit around 5:30 a.m. ET, triggered a simultaneous drop in the price of most major cryptocurrencies. The drop you see in the following 12-hour price chart of bitcoin starting at that time was repeated again and again throughout the market.  The blockings have been independently verified by CoinDesk.  According a tweet by Dovey Wan, founding partner of crypto asset holding company Primitive Ventures, the blocked accounts are a mix of influencers, media outlets, miners and wallets.  ""This time is much more widely cleansing it seems like, many industry players like wallets, individual influencers, media outlet, top traders and even meme accts are all shut,"" Wan said in a subsequent tweet.  The blocking of the accounts is rekindling fears of a crackdown on cryptocurrencies in China, concerns that have been weighing on the market over the past several weeks.  In recent trading, the price of every member of the CoinDesk 20 (with the obvious exception of stablecoin USDC) is down over the last 24 hours, ranging from Yearn Finance's YFI, 1.59% drop to NuCypher's NU with a 15.9% plunge.

Solana had planned on closing a smaller round in March but boosted its ambitions in response to strong demand, the report said.  The project plans to use the funds, in part, to become a go-to place for decentralized applications, taking aim at the Ethereum blockchain, the current leader in the space, the report said.  Decrypt executives didn't deny the report, Decrypt said.  Alameda, a trading firm led by Bankman-Fried, has been heavily investing in the Solana ecosystem in a bid to promote an Ethereum alternative capable of faster transactions and higher scalability. The Ethereum blockchain has become increasingly congested, leading to an increase in transactional tariffs known as “gas fees.”  Bankman-Fried’s team chose to build Serum, a decentralized exchange (DEX), on Solana.  Ethereum currently handles about 15 transactions per second (TPS), while Solana is capable of more than 1,000 TPS, according to data from Blockchair and Solana Beach. The project claims its maximum speed is many times in excess of that.

Police arrested one of the men at a Deventer warehouse that held several computers used for mining cryptocurrency. There “was also an issue of electricity theft,” according to a press release posted on the website of the National Dutch Police.  The arrests stemmed from an investigation of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinhouse.eu, which authorities have suspected of embezzling customers’ money and defrauding them.  In what authorities described as a pump-and-dump scheme, one of the men, a 39-year-old, produced the cryptocurrency and advertised it on a cryptocurrency platform and Twitter, luring investors and boosting the price. He then sold a large volume of digital coins over a short time frame, rendering them “worthless.”  The 39-year-old man is also suspected of similarly trying to scam investors using ERSO, MALC, EUROP and TulipMania digital currencies, the press release said.
