42383084,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkv3,1574294340,Vermont Utility Customers to Trade Renewable Energy Credits on LO3 Blockchain,"Vermont’s largest electric utility is using blockchain platform LO3 Energy for its new energy marketplace pilot project, embracing blockchain tech as Green Mountain Power (GMP) drives toward a 100% renewable goal in the next five years.      GMP’s program is called Vermont Green and will be available through a mobile app for GMP’s 220,612 customers on Dec. 3.      It allows Vermonters to buy and sell renewables with a blockchain storing their transactions.      Energy blog Microgrid Knowledge first reported the new service after it was revealed in a Nov. 18 filing with the state regulator.      Since winning a 2016 patent for geothermal energy transfers, green energy startup LO3 has built out high-profile partnerships for its peer-to-peer system. It won an undisclosed sum investment from fossil fuel giant Shell in July.    With this launch, LO3 Energyhttps://lo3energy.com/first-us-marketplace-for-locally-produced-clean-energy-launched-by-lo3-energy-and-green-mountain-power/ becomes the service of choice in Vermont’s latest green energy campaign. GMP picked LO3’s proposal from six different applicants, according to the filing, recognizing that blockchain provides the best solution for user privacy and transaction immutability.    Additionally, blockchain allows the service to grow alongside an increasingly decentralized marketplace, the regulatory filing said.      “As an increasing number of distributed assets are deployed across GMP’s service territory, GMP views the ability to utilize distributed consensus associated with blockchain as a potential means to efficiently track this chain of custody going forward.”      As it stands, market participants will set bids for renewable energy credits on the GMP app, host to LO3’s Pando energy marketplace. The utility expects renewable-conscious businesses in particular to buy credits through the app.      Stakeholders believe the pilot marketplace shores up a problem in Vermont’s renewables-heavy energy sector; with services like home solar panels booming, there’s more than enough electricity to go around.      “There’s a huge appetite for local businesses to be 100 percent renewable and at the same time there’s an increasing amount of home solar production,” LO3 Energy founder and CEO Lawrence Orsini said in a statement.      “This platform pairs the local supply with demand at the grid edge and we are delighted to be working with GMP to bring this market to commercial reality.”      Graham Turk, Innovation strategist for GMP, wrote in the Nov. 18 filing that blockchain works in this use scenario.      “Blockchain is uniquely-suited for tracking chains of custody (especially for non-physical assets like VGAs), creating a more transparent tracking system for buyers, sellers, and regulators. LO3’s platform is designed with scalability in mind and such future expansion may be found practical.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/20/vermont-utility-customers-to-trade-renewable-energy-credits-on-lo3-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c323a5b42adaf83ce9eabcea3946f56b7a657b7-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383031,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkfx,1574289866,1 Gigawatt Bitcoin Mine Under Construction in Texas Would Dwarf Bitmain's,"Bitmain, which recently broke ground on a massive bitcoin mine at a former Alcoa plant in Texas, will have competition for that “world’s largest” mantle.      A project broke ground this month that would start at 300 megawatts and expand to 1 gigawatt by the end of next year, dwarfing Bitmain’s mine that contemplates expanding from 25 MW to 50 MW to only 300 megawatts in its largest phase.      Data center developer Whinstone US, which owns a bitcoin mine in Louisiana and has been building in the Netherlands and Sweden, assembled the Rockdale project in partnership with GMO Internet, Japan’s version of GoDaddy.      A week after the ground-breaking on Nov. 7, Whinstone US agreed to be acquired by Germany’s Northern Bitcoin, which runs a bitcoin mine in Norway on renewable resources.      In the all stock deal, Northern Bitcoin will issue 3,720,750 new shares to Whinstone US shareholders, according to Northern Bitcoin’s head of communications.      On Wednesday, shares in Northern Bitcoin (ETR: NB2) jumped 42% to €23.60, valuing the company at about €180 million.      The data center will cost $150 million to build and furnish, Whinstone estimated when it unveiled the jobs-ready project to much locale fanfare on Nov. 1.      The mine would ramp up to full capacity through 2020, with 300 megawatts of power slated to come online in the first quarter and the full 1 gigawatt scheduled for the fourth quarter.      In fact, the dueling mining projects share a common landlord. Both inhabit real estate owned by Aluminum giant Alcoa which purchased the 33,000+ acre plot of land in the 1950s and turned the area locally known as Sandow Lakes Ranch into an industrial hub.      Northern Bitcoin said two listed companies have signed on as its first clients and they “will use a significant portion of the capacity for Bitcoin mining,"" but the company declined to name them.      In a joint statement announcing their merger, Aroosh Thillainathan, co-founder of Whinstone US, said the deal could “shape the future course of the global mining industry” and Mathis Schultz, CEO of Northern Bitcoin AG, said the merger “catapults” his firm launched in 2018 to the top of the pack faster than planned.      In July, Whinstone’s previous proposed merger fell through after Hydro66 Holdings Corp., a Swedish data center builder, completed its own capital raise and backed out of the deal.",NEUTRAL,GMO,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | GMO,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/20/1-gigawatt-bitcoin-mine-under-construction-in-texas-would-dwarf-bitmains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f02d721b4c6e2b71b090a42e01c8d1cc73534d73-1279x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383038,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkjj,1574278507,"In Wargaming Exercise, a Digital Yuan Neuters US Sanctions and North Korea Buys Nukes","China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) has undermined the dollar’s dominance of the global financial system. North Korea has used the digital yuan to build and test nuclear missiles, safely evading financial sanctions imposed by Washington. And malicious actors are stealing funds from the SWIFT communications network to prove a point.          But don't worry. It's only a game, for now.      These scenarios were dreamed up by an all-star cast of former high-ranking U.S. officials during a wargaming exercise conducted Tuesday night. The simulated principals committee meeting (PC meeting) was held by the Harvard Kennedy School and Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in Cambridge, Massachusetts.      The Beltway veterans played the roles of National Security Council (NSC) members who convene in 2021 to discuss the potential threat to the U.S. after China rolls out its proposed CBDC.      The imaginary meeting takes place a few days after North Korea has conducted a major missile test using materials purchased with the digital yuan.      “The competitiveness of the U.S. dollar is a matter of national security,” said Neha Narula, portraying a digital currency czar and advisor to the U.S. president in the discussion. Even in the simulation’s timeline, “we are still in a place where the U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency.”      The dollar “has incredible importance” because the U.S. can “weaponize” it through the use of sanctions, she said.      “That could change if suddenly another currency becomes more interesting and more viable,” Narula said. “We have to keep pace for this innovation.”      A veritable who’s who of government and academia participated in the exercise, including former U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter; former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler; former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns; former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Jennifer Fowler; former special assistant and Deputy National Security Advisor Meghan O’Sullivan; former Secretary of Defense Chief of Staff Eric Rosenbach; former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers; former Ambassador to India Richard Verma; MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative director Narula; and Belfer Center executive director Aditi Kumar.      Before the exercise began, Narula told CoinDesk that her hope was lawmakers and other regulators might be paying attention.      “I hope [the simulation] gets people really thinking [about] what the impact of digital currencies are, and it gets people thinking now and not later,” she said. “I think it could almost serve as a template or a guide to sort of kick-start the conversation around these issues.”    American dominance    The U.S.’s dominant role in the global financial system enables it to cut off adversaries, but it is also largely dependent on cooperation with other nations, Summers said, reprising his role as the Treasury Secretary for the exercise.      In this regard, China’s central bank digital currency is perhaps less impactful on dollar hegemony than is the U.S.’s diplomatic relations with the world’s most populous country.      “Fundamentally, our ability to sanction North Korea in a devastating way depends on Chinese cooperation … that was true before the digital yuan and that is true now in the presence of the digital yuan,” he said.      However, the U.S. may not be able to exert its mighty influence for much longer, said Gensler, who played the assistant to the president on economic policy in the simulation. It could take China decades to build up the infrastructure needed to fully compete with the dollar, but in real life, countries are already taking steps to move away from the greenback.      Russia, as one example, has already begun adopting China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), he said.      In the game, Chinese authorities have claimed the digital yuan “is fully portable,” said Kumar, meaning different countries can create their own instances of the system by choosing banks and payment providers as node participants based around the Chinese central bank digital currency infrastructure.      Aside from sanctions, “I also worry about ‘are we going down the road of bifurcating the global economy’ and ‘how far down are we on that road’ and ‘do our options actually take us further down that road?’” said O’Sullivan, playing the vice president of the United States in the simulation.      Though Washington could take measures to shore up its financial dominance, it is entirely possible that the emergence of China’s digital currency and other moves away from the dollar mean the world is transitioning to one where the U.S. is not the king of the hill, O’Sullivan said.      “We may already be in a world where we're not financially dominant, certainly not in every sphere, and so we have to think about what do we do with the rest of our foreign policy tools?” she said.      Summers acknowledged this possibility, but dismissed the suggestion that the U.S. issuing its own digital currency could have an impact on this state of affairs.      “If we have our own digital yuan, digital dollar, national Venmo, whatever the hell it is, it will do nothing to interfere one whit with the ability of others,” he said.    Threats to SWIFT    Throughout the discussion, American reliance on the SWIFT system as part of its sanctions regime was repeatedly noted.      In a twist near the end of the simulation, imaginary North Korean actors stole $3 billion from the SWIFT interbank messaging system to push other countries toward the digital yuan. This sort of theft is not without precedent: malicious actors have already stolen millions from SWIFT in the past.      “Right now we have one network that doesn’t work very well,” Summers said.      The U.S.’s path forward should be reinforcing SWIFT, rather than contemplating a U.S. central bank digital currency, he said. No other nation’s currency, digital or otherwise, is a legitimate threat to the U.S. in his view.      “Let's be honest here in the Situation Room. Europe's a museum, Japan's a nursing home and China's a jail and we don't need to worry about those currencies being some kind of major threat to us,” Summers said. “A hardened SWIFT that will be secure has to be our first priority.”      Developing a separate digital dollar project might be “the worst idea in the world,” as it could dilute resources and attention, he said.      Verma, playing the U.S. ambassador to China in the simulation, said his recommendation would be to see how the U.S. can partner with the Chinese government on its ongoing payments efforts.      “We’re upset in this room because they got there ahead of us,” he said.      There’s also the question of why any nation or group would move to China’s central bank digital currency.      Carter, back in his old Defense Secretary’s chair for the simulation, said he does not see any logical reason for a digital currency replacing SWIFT, “but there is something psychological and we have to take that seriously.”      The U.S. should continue backing the system it has worked on for decades, he said.      ""I think much of the world's economy supports that for a very good reason, there's no particular reason for them to go for the Chinese alternative now,” Carter said.

42383041,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tksX,1574276434,Polymath Moves Security Token Platform Off Ethereum and Onto Parity's Substrate,"Polymath has fallen out of love with ethereum.      The security token issuer has migrated its Polymesh blockchain onto Substrate, the platform developed by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood’s Parity Technologies. Polymesh becomes one of the first blockchains to make the jump. Polymath first announced it was building the Polymesh blockchain in May.      As part of the transition, Parity has agreed to build certain business-logic features on Polymesh’s base layer, including smart contract communication and runtime modules, said Parity Technologies chief commercial officer Björn Wagner.      Polymath’s ST20 security token (built on ethereum’s ERC-1400 standard) and native POLY token (an ERC-20) will journey over to the new Substrate-based chain, the firm's head of blockchain, Adam Dossa, said in an email. A bridge for POLY tokens will be maintained for at least one year.    Why migrate?    At the center of contention is ethereum’s consensus mechanism, proof-of-work (PoW), which only offers a statistical guarantee of transaction finality. Dossa said a different mechanism is needed for the institutions Polymath aims to serve. (Ethereum is in the process of upgrading to proof-of-stake (PoS) with a target launch date of early 2020.)      “While ethereum has some great attributes, regulated assets and security tokens live in a world which quite often jar with the world ethereum lives in,” Polymath's Dossa said in a phone interview.      A major issue Dossa pointed out was block reorgs, which are technically possible in PoW systems. In a block reorg, individual blocks containing transactions are rolled back to rescind a disputed transaction. However, ethereum has only experienced one reorg ever following the infamous DAO hack of 2016.      For businesses working with regulated assets and security tokens, even strong statistical guarantees aren’t enough, Dossa said.      “When a [Substrate] transaction is finalized, it cannot be undone,” he added.      Substrate supports multiple – and even custom – consensus algorithms.      How ethereum settles transactions through mining also came into consideration for Polymath, Dossa said. Since miners, who process and sign-off on transactions for a fee, can operate anywhere in the world, institutions could face government scrutiny if fees are traced back to a sanctioned country.      “The mining process is permissionless. If you’re paying transactions on ethereum, you don’t really know where that transaction is going to end up. For a large institution that could be an issue,” Dossa said.      Substrate and Polymesh    It’s not just ethereum, however. Dossa said the team looked at Hyperledger Fabric, among other candidates, at the behest of Polymesh technical advisor Charles Hoskinson.      Describing Substrate as a “modular, flexible framework,” Dossa said the platform beat out the competition due to the simplicity of building smart contracts from the ground up, a must for the firm.      “Security tokens need to be flexible,” Dossa said. “There might be some very custom compliance logic you may need. We wanted to give people the option in a rich and flexible way.”      Regarding Polkadot, which was built on Substrate by both Parity and the Web3 Foundation, Dossa said Polymath remains open to interoperability down the road.      “At the moment we are focused on building the Polymesh blockchain,” he said. “Of course, we keep an eye on other types of technology. In the future, it’s something we will keep it closely under review.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/11/20/polymath-moves-security-token-platform-off-ethereum-and-onto-paritys-substrate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6f218a3e6c3ccaf86c2c0da944cd9b6212b2ce1-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now, thanks to a chatbot from London-based trading startup Artificial Intelligence Exchange (AiX), OTC traders can hide their trades from any human broker.      The artificial intelligence tool for big-money traders is coming to the crypto markets in December. After that, AiX intends to roll it out to traditional asset classes in Q1 2020.      AiX claims its AI chatbot can replace human brokers in trading. It automates pre- and post-trade administration, assists in negotiations, performs pre-trade credit checks and passes trade details electronically to a settlement agency or clearinghouse.      “It can handle negotiations between multiple counterparties,” AiX CEO Jos Evans said. “We’re automating the whole system front to back.”      December won’t be AiX’s debut. In 2018, the firm completed what it called the first AI-brokered trade between Rockwell Capital Management and TLDR Capital.      Evans says a selling point for the crypto trading community is the ability for institutions to trade anonymously.      Currently, digital market-making and trading firms require traders to connect to their systems via application programming interfaces (APIs), allowing those firms to know which positions traders have taken, Evans said.      Users interact with the AI chatbot through Telegram or Symphony and can begin trading after completing AiX’s know-your-customer requirements.      The AiX chatbot combines natural language processing and cognitive reasoning technology, Evans said.      This combination of tech gives AiX the ability to hold a conversation with customers in which the bot can clarify the customer’s intention – something that has been elusive for many AI companies until recently      “AiX can communicate with a client in a workflow versus them using a dropdown system to select trade parameters,” Evans said. “Our system can speak to them during the process, ask them questions and give them options. We can say to them, ‘This is what we got right now. Do you want to do X or Y?’”      AiX will source liquidity through a wide range of market users. Fifty crypto firms are in the onboarding process and 50 more are in the pipeline, according to Evans. The chief executive refused to name those firms until the December launch but claims they’re some of the largest names in crypto.      The tool is also compliant with the markets in financial instruments directive (MiFID), a European Union regulation that sets transparency requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency.

42383044,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkq1,1574266408,"Too Early to Tell if Libra Is a Security, CFTC Chairman Says","Heath Tarbert, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), says it is not yet clear what sort of product Libra will be – including whether it might be a security.      Speaking to CNBC at the sidelines of the CME Group Global Financial Leadership conference Tuesday, Tarbert addressed the current U.S. regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and the nation's global position regarding the technology.      While CNBC originally stated that Tarbert claimed ""Facebook's Libra is a security,"" the headline was changed after publication. Rather, Tarbert only contrasted bitcoin, which the CFTC has classified as a commodity, with Libra in terms of its current stage of development.      Bitcoin has been around for 10 years, is well understood, and the CFTC is ""able to classify that not as a security but as a commodity,"" he said. Libra, on the other hand, is a ""fundamentally different product,"" but currently in a state of flux.      ""Libra is developing and there are a bunch of unanswered questions – and also the way that it's structured, linking it directly to a set of national currencies – a very different product,"" he said.      Former CFTC chair Gary Gensler has previously argued that Libra should indeed be regulated as a security.      Still, a CFTC decision over Libra's status will likely have to wait until the stablecoin – which is expected by the Libra Association to be pegged to the U.S. dollar, euro, the yen, the U.K. pound and the Singapore dollar – is launched. That's slated for mid or late next year, if the project can get over the considerable regulatory pushback it's seen so far.      Highlighting that it's still too early to classify the digital currency when it's still in the works, Libra co-creator David Marcus has also said that it may ultimately be split into separate stablecoins each pegged to a different fiat currency.      Elsewhere in the interview, Tarbert addressed the perception that the U.S. is not seen as the global leader when it comes to blockchain regulation.      ""I don't think we're at the top of the list; we may not be at the bottom. I think the Libra association is a good example of this,"" he said. ""They could have chosen any place in the world to set up. They chose Switzerland. My understanding is a second choice was Singapore.""      However, Tarbert said he is working to ensure the U.S. is a leader since the costs are potentially high should the nation fall behind others.

42383032,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkeh,1574262000,Promoting a New Token? Satoshi's Treasure Wants You to Gamify It,"Satoshi’s Treasure, a global hunt for keys to a $1 million bitcoin prize, may offer a model for gamifying token issuance.      According to Satoshi’s Treasure co-creator Eric Meltzer of Primitive Ventures, the tech-savvy scavenger hunt game is run through an offshore company, so that none of the people sponsoring it or arranging puzzles know the secrets behind all the keys. The first player or team to collect 400 keys, out of 1,000 potential keys, will be able to claim the bitcoin loot.      Now the game is expanding beyond bitcoin.      Meltzer said the Tezos Foundation has become the clandestine startup’s first client, with a side game for players to earn Tezzies starting in December. So far, Meltzer said roughly 20 percent of main-game keys have been released. All the keys should be released by mid-2020.      This global scavenger hunt started seven months ago and currently has around 50,000 email subscribers, Meltzer said. This represents a slight dip from the summer, when the game attracted new backers willing to contribute prizes and key distribution. Supporters include Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan and IDEO CoLab Ventures.      In the meantime, the VC-backed blockchain startup Quorum Control is launching its own text-based video game this week with more 10 keys to the Satoshi’s Treasure bitcoin prize, plus dozens of rewards related to its own native blockchain, Tupelo. The staff referred to this as an “earned airdrop,” distributing access to new or pre-launch tokens.      “The business model is evolving towards helping people distribute their tokens,” Primitive’s Meltzer said. “We’re hoping to repeat that model with a bunch of other coins. … We think it’s better than an airdrop model, to have people kind of work for them.”      To be clear, Quorum Control isn’t a client of Satoshi’s Treasure and hasn’t even launched a mainnet yet. However, it offers players yet another opportunity to explore gamification for cryptocurrency projects.      Quorum Control co-founder Andrew Holz said this new testnet-based quest – “Jason’s Game” – was modeled after the vintage video game Zork. The game, hosted via Quorum Control’s website with an in-game crypto wallet, involves four levels with riddles and puzzles that players interact with as they would with a command-line terminal.    The new airdrop    In addition to offering winners clues to the million-dollar bitcoin prize, there are also strings of numbers and letters that go into the player’s wallet like a non-fungible token (NFT).      “This [NFT] is the way to get those tokens ahead of time. Kind of like a promissory note for the tokens, a set amount of the initial supply,” Holz said of roughly 120,000 Tupel tokens that will be distributed to more than 17 winners, ranked by challenge and speed.      The Tupelo blockchain, which Holz said will launch a mainnet in 2020, has a unique structure compared to networks like ethereum. These tokens won’t be distributed in a public sale, so this game is one of the few ways people who aren’t accredited investors can gain access early on.      “Rather than have one big central chain that you have to put all of the information on, you actually have one for each NFT, it kind of creates its own history and you can add whatever information you need to about it,” he said. “If you were trying to do this in real-time on ethereum, the performance just wouldn’t be there.”      Initialized Capital co-founder Garry Tan said his firm plans to acquire tokens as well, through its equity deal with the startup. From his perspective, this game is a way to test the technology while boosting brand awareness among crypto veterans.      “With ethereum or bitcoin, everything is in the public chain, while [Tupelo] allows for flexible privacy,” Tan said. “Crypto is still at this nascent stage, we need the builders and hackers to know these are the tools to do that. … The audience of this game is exactly the right type of people.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | AIRDROP,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/20/promoting-a-new-token-satoshis-treasure-wants-you-to-gamify-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb665d2ec06937cc7b8540f9c57680eca33c534e-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383028,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkZf,1574254800,"ShapeShift Launches Exchange Token, FOX, for Commission-Free Trading","ShapeShift is launching its own token, FOX, doubling down on the exchange’s attempts to further decentralized cryptocurrency trading.      ShapeShift released the token, akin to Binance’s BNB, on Wednesday, enabling commission-free trading with zero fees between cryptocurrencies. All platform users who sign up get 100 FOX tokens automatically, which, if held, never expire and provide $10 worth of free trading volume per token on a rolling 30-day basis.      “We've obviously been thinking about doing a token ever since 2017 and we wanted to wade into it very slowly and carefully,” said founder and CEO Erik Voorhees in an in-person interview Tuesday. “We've been kind of evolving our concept of what our coin is going to be over the last two and a half years.”      ShapeShift’s FOX joins other exchange tokens such as Binance Coin and Bithumb Coin (BN). While still falling under the “utility token” classification, the ERC-20 token has a limited purpose, at least for now.      “This has nothing to do with establishing a new chain,” Voorhees said of FOX. “Basically, we're trying to get people away from custodial exchanges. This is anendemic problem in the crypto world that was a problem in 2011 when I first got involved and it’s still a problem. So, we realized that to solve that we had to provide all that stuff in one place.”      While similar tokens facilitate value transfers between exchange products, FOX furthers ShapeShift’s permissionless ideology by attracting users to a self-custodial exchange with more liquidity than similarly styled platforms, Voorhees said.      For now, FOX is basically a digital coupon. In the future, Voorhees said, it could be used for more functions on the exchange. The exchange minted a finite 1 billion FOX tokens, he said.      “We're hoping that this will help marginally move some people away from custodians and be more comfortable with the non-custodial model,” Voorhees said about the project’s aim.      The token launch follows the July debut of ShapeShift’s new platform, which Voorhees said was an answer to the crypto market’s overreliance on custodial exchanges such as Coinbase.      As such, Voorhees sees FOX as the third pillar of the company’s strategy to boost financial self-sovereignty      “ShapeShift’s goal,” Voorhees wrote in a blog post published Wednesday, “is to make self-custody a seamless and enjoyable experience, because this will help the world move toward self-sovereign finance, and away from fiat.”      Voorhees says the exchange has more liquidity than any other self-custody option, like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or swap services. While total trade volume decreased on the platform since the implementation of KYC, liquidity has increased over the same period by 10x on the exchange’s main pair, BTC/ETH, Voorhees said.      ""ShapeShift is always the counterparty to each trade,” Voorhees explained. (Typically, order book exchanges match a buyer and seller for each trade.)      “This means we provide liquidity in whatever increments we feel comfortable offering,” he said. “We enable up to $50,000 single trades, and a user can trade over and over so long as each trade is under that size.""",POSITIVE,BNB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | BNB,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/20/shapeshift-launches-exchange-token-fox-for-commission-free-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcc1accf4fa96fd39dbec8335a6391df0062d8b5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383030,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkdR,1574254800,"XRP Is Used in Crime, But Far Less Often Than Bitcoin, Elliptic Says","Criminals have used XRP to carry out their illicit activities, though hardly to the same degree as bitcoin, according to a new report from blockchain sleuthing firm Elliptic.      Some $400 million worth of XRP can be traced back to a variety of Ponzi schemes and darknet activities, Elliptic said in a report released Wednesday. While that may sound like a lot, it represents just 0.2 percent of XRP transactions. By comparison, $829 million of bitcoin, or 0.5 percent of that network’s transactions, have been spent on the dark web, the analytics vendor said.      “Regardless of the amount, it just demonstrates that there is illicit activity going on in this coin,” said Tom Robinson, chief scientist and co-founder of Elliptic. “Therefore, if you are a business handling some of these transactions then you need to be checking for it because you don't want to be the organization that's being used to launder those proceeds.”      Such concerns are especially acute for XRP’s target market, regulated financial institutions. Ripple, the distributed ledger technology (DLT) startup that owns an estimated 60 percent of the XRP supply and periodically sells the tokens to fund operations, has been pitching banks software that utilizes XRP for the last few years.      A Ripple spokesperson said: “Like other cryptocurrencies, XRP is open source and decentralized – it’s available to anyone to use. Ripple enabled XRP transactions are secure and through regulated institutions.”      Blockchain forensic firms like Elliptic tackle crypto involvement in things like drugs, weapons, child sexual abuse material and ransomware-as-a-service. In the case of XRP, much of the transactions related to scams and Ponzi schemes, said Robinson.      For instance, a large chunk was accounted for by the Plus Token “investment” scheme. Earlier this year, Chinese authorities arrested six Chinese nationals on the Pacific island of Vanuatu suspected of orchestrating the scam, which collected billions in crypto from people in China and South Korea.      There has been an increase in the use of crypto to purchase things like stolen credit card numbers on the dark web and Elliptic had detected a number of those sites accepting XRP alongside other cryptos.      But Robinson said the relatively small amount of illicit use of XRP might be down its association with traditional finance, compared to other cryptocurrencies.      “The fact that the Ripple network itself has been targeted at large traditional banks maybe doesn't resonate with criminals trying to use it,” he said.      Ripple set out to provide a cheap and efficient cryptocurrency bridge to connect correspondent banks and so provide near-instant cross-border payments. Back in 2015, it was among the first crypto companies to receive a fine from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for AML failings. But this was viewed as a positive among a fledgling crypto industry because it meant Ripple was closer to being regulated than other crypto firms at that time.      The same could be said for XRP in the context of having its tires kicked by Elliptic, said Robinson, since highlighting illicit XRP activity will only improve the network’s credibility.      “Wherever you have any kind of value transfer mechanism there is going to be potentially some illicit use,” said Robinson. “I think having clarity of that and being able to know where it’s happening should give banks comfort rather than a cause for concern.”      To be clear, Elliptic was dealing with XRP, the crypto asset only. “We haven’t had any interaction with the Ripple company,” said Robinson.      Another large investor in XRP is Japan’s SBI Holdings (previously known as Softbank Investment), which also led a $23 million investment round in Elliptic earlier this year.

42375637,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Nvl,1574249076,Bitcoin Erases 75% of October Price Rally as S&P 500 Hits Record Highs,"Bitcoin is looking south after erasing three-quarters of the price rally seen in October. The bearish mood comes as the U.S. equities market is soaring in the opposite direction.  The top cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $8,070 on Bitstamp, down 22 percent from the October high of $10,350. With the pullback, BTC has erased nearly 75 percent of the sudden surge from $7,293 to $10,350 witnessed in the two days to Oct. 26.  Bitcoin's inability to capitalize on the breakout into five figures and the subsequent drop to $8,000 has been associated with the lack of positive catalysts. Moreover, prices had jumped above $10,000 reportedly on hopes that BTC, being a leading cryptocurrency, would benefit from China's push toward wide blockchain adoption.  While bitcoin has dropped by more than $2,000 in the last 3.5-weeks, the U.S. stock market has put on a sterling show, as seen in the chart below.  The S&P 500 index rose to a record high of 3127.6 on Tuesday, having found acceptance above the psychological resistance of $3,000 last week. Notably, the index has rallied for six straight weeks, possibly in response to the Federal Reserve's expansion of its balance sheet, as suggested by popular analyst Sven Henrich/Northman Trader.  The Fed has added more than $270 billion to its balance sheet since Sept. 11 and currently has around $4.04 trillion worth of assets, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Fed Reserve Chairman Jeremy Powell has repeatedly said that the ongoing bond purchases are aimed at normalizing the money markets, which went ballistic in September and pushed the overnight rate as high as 10 percent.  Analysts and investors, however, are of the opinion that the Fed has embarked on round four of the quantitative easing (QE) program, as discussed last month. Under a QE program, the central bank buys government bonds to infuse liquidity into the economy and lower interest rates to boost growth.  Looking forward, the S&P 500 may trim recent gains in the short term, courtesy of renewed China-U.S. political tensions. China's foreign ministry on Wednesday threatened retaliation to the U.S. Senate's decision to pass legislation aimed at safeguarding human rights in Hong Kong amid a crackdown on the pro-democracy protest movement.  The crypto market community believes BTC is a risk-off asset. The cryptocurrency, however, does not have a credible story as a haven asset, as recently pointed out by CoinDesk's Galen Moore, and may find little love amid the U.S.-China political tiff.  That said, If China retaliates by devaluing the yuan (CNY) significantly, BTC may pick up a bid on hopes of increased demand from the world's second-largest economy.  Such rallies, however, seldom last. For instance, BTC jumped 7 percent on Aug. 5 as CNY slipped beyond 7 per USD. The cryptocurrency, however, topped out above $12,300 on the following day and fell back to $9,400 by the end of August, even though CNY continued to slide and hit a multi-year low of 7.1842 on Sept. 3.  Further, the technical charts indicate BTC could extend the recent decline to key support near $7,700.     Daily and 3-day charts  The series of lower highs and lower lows seen on the dailychart indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside.  The MACD histogram is printing deeper bars below the zero line, signaling a strengthening of bearish momentum. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 reading.  The RSI on the three-day chart is also hovering below 50 andthe MACD histogram is teasing a bearish crossover below zero.  BTC, therefore, looks set to test $7,850 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $3,122 to $13,880.  Monthly chart  BTC has dropped to $8,000, as expected, having failed to hold on to gains above the descending (bearish) 10-month moving average (MA) earlier this month. Major support is now seen near $7,700 (ascending 10-day MA).  The RSI on the 4-hour chart (not shown) is reporting oversold conditions. Hence, a minor bounce to $8,400 may be seen before a slide to $7,700.  The short-term outlook would turn bullish if prices print a high-volume UTC close above the descending trendline hurdle on the daily chart , currently at $8,460.

The MAS published a consultation paper on Wednesday, seeking to green-light what it calls ""payment token derivatives"" for listing and trading on ""approved exchanges"" in the country under its Securities and Futures Act (SFA).      The proposal comes as a response to demand from international institutional investors for regulated products to be able to hedge their exposure to payment tokens such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the agency said.      Singapore now has four approved exchanges, namely, Asia Pacific Exchange, ICE Futures Singapore, Singapore Exchange Derivatives Trading and Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, according to MAS.      Payment tokens such as bitcoin and ether are currently not categorized as an underlying assets for a derivative product under the oversight of the SFA. However, MAS said it has received requests to put such assets under its regulatory remit in order for them to be listed on approved venues.      The move comes just days after news report that Bakkt, the bitcoin futures market launched by New York Stock Exchange owner ICE, is expanding its physically settled bitcoin futures product in Asia, making it available for trading on ICE Futures Singapore.

The bill was prepared by Ukraine's Digital Transformation Ministry, the Blockchain4Ukraine inter-factional parliamentary association and the Better Regulation Delivery Office (BRDO) organization, the ministry said in an announcement reported by local news agency UNIAN on Tuesday.  The document, authored by 13 members of the parliament, is intended to amend Ukraine's Taxation Code and introduce principal concepts related to the crypto assets. The bill defines such assets as a ""special type of valuable property in the digital form, created, accounted for and disposed of electronically,"" such as cryptocurrencies, tokens and other kinds not specified in the draft.  “We are confident that the adoption of this [draft] law will create conditions for the launch of the virtual assets market in line with the legislation of Ukraine, taking into account the balance of interests of entities engaged in transactions with virtual assets and the state, which will get additional tax revenue from such transactions,"" said the ministry.  If the bill passes parliament, the income from trading virtual assets will be calculated as the difference between the purchase price and the amount received at sale. Gains should be declared as “other” type of income, while losses may not be balanced out to reduce the total financial result before taxes, the document says.  Crypto income would generally be taxed at the standard rate, which is 18 percent in Ukraine. But in better news for traders, there's an initial 5 percent rate on personal income from the sale of crypto assets for a five-year period following approval of the bill (assuming it passes).  Sales of crypto assets would not be liable for value added tax (VAT).  Tokenized assets would see a different tax application, being defined as digital assets certifying ownership or non-property rights. In these cases, tokens would be taxed in the same way as the goods or services backing them.  Michael Chobanian, founder of the Ukraine-based crypto exchange Kuna and president of the Blockchain Association of Ukraine, said he believes the law would work, but there are other hurdles facing the industry that need to be addressed.  ""If the National Bank of Ukraine doesn't allow banks to open accounts for crypto businesses in Ukraine nothing for the industry will really change,"" Chobanian said.  The ministry recently announced a partnership with the Binance cryptocurrency exchange for assistance developing regulations for crypto in the country.
