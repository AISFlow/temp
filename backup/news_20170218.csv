Most of you are probably thinking ‘what for’?”  So said RCI Bank head of innovation and partnerships Jean-Christophe Labarre about participating in one of the bigger consortiums bringing together institutions looking into blockchain technology.  The comment drew some laughter from the crowd of attendees at day one of the developer-focused EDCON conference in Paris, France. The reaction seemed to voice agreement from the developers that they were not so excited by the promise of private consortium applications when compared to the enthusiasm for public ethereum blockchain which anyone can join.  Labarre was one of the first to address the crowd on day one, but the reaction seemed to extend to other private implementations as well.  For example, Enterprise Ethereum, first reported on by CoinDesk at the beginning of the year, is a secretive project that's in the process of emerging from the shadows.  Public details are, so far, thin on the ground, but the gist is that it seems like an equivalent of R3 but utilizing ethereum, with big banks like JP Morgan and Santander reportedly joining ranks.  Knowing that, attendees shared opinions on enterprise applications of ethereum in general and whether or not it would have an impact going forwards. While some were ambivalent, the most common view seemed to be that it would benefit the public ethereum blockchain overall.  ""I think it would be a good way for people at the corporate world to hear about Ethereum,"" Jorge Izquierdo, tech lead at ethereum project Aragon, told CoinDesk, adding:  “Probably they have some use cases, but I personally think the public chain will eventually work and will be more important.”  Having said that, his partner, Aragon project lead Luis Cuende, sounded less convinced, saying: “In some way it misses the point.""  Serving a purpose  Others seemed more optimistic. Yessin Schiegg, former advisor for the Ethereum Foundation, described what he sees as the potential applications.  “Banks putting up their own blockchain system consortium that has the benefit of cost-savings to the banks. It’s a new way to get together. It’s a good thing,” he said.  It’s fairly common to hear comparisons of budding public blockchains (such as ethereum) to an early internet, which took time to grow and develop.  Some go as far as to argue that private blockchain implementations are like intranets – the private networks that were popular with organizations for a time.  But, the open internet is what ultimately won out. And, the open internet, so goes the analogy, is more like the public ethereum blockchain, since it's one big system to which anyone can connect.  Schiegg made the same analogy, but with his own twist, arguing that private internet lines still have an impact today, so private blockchain networks probably will too.  “I think it will survive for a long time. Nowadays, 20 years into the internet, we still have banks having bulletin boards with dedicated lines which are completely cut off from the internet. Permissioned blockchains will survive and coexist and will serve their purpose,” he said.  This echoes what others in the space have said for a while, that private and public blockchains will each have a place in industry going forwards.  Still, Schiegg emphasized (multiple times) that he thinks that the main ethereum chain will have a more far-reaching impact overall.  “True disruption will come from public implementations,"" he said. ""But it will take a lot more time because you can set up an MPV [minimum viable product] within months, whereas in order to take advantage of the network affect, the public blockchain needs to grow for years.""  Trojan horse  The EDCON conference talks focused mainly on potential additions to the public ethereum platform, and enterprise applications were not often the subject of discussion.  However, CEO of Brainbot Technologies Heiko Hees, perhaps best known for work on the Raiden Network, delivered a presentation on Trustline Networks, which he described as “Ripple for ethereum” that would be one day be downloadable as a mobile app.  Outside of the presentations, the Aragon team offered bold ideas for how enterprise implementations could potentially provide a 'Trojan horse' for the public ethereum blockchain – a common interpretation of the developing situation.  Izquierdo offered the example of how Aragon-style firms (essentially DAOs, or leaderless companies) could first be implemented on private networks run by a national government, before they move to a more public venue.  As a developer working on a range of enterprise ethereum applications, architect of the ethereum e-wallet project Omise Rick Dudley put his reaction more bluntly:  “This will be good for ethereum.”  Image via Alyssa Hertig for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/18/secretive-enterprise-ethereum-project-gets-mixed-reactions-at-edcon-2017,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1068cefacba9423e1a6ce4a8d302e3b135d33b54-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427378,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKB55h,1487413815,Can Blockchain Make Music Great Again?,"Blockchain technology can't write songs or play instruments – at least not yet. But, it might be able to ensure that those who do get the proper credit and compensation, a problem that has always bedeviled this $15bn industry.  Since the start of the 2017 alone, both The Three Degrees and The Carpenters have brought cases against their record companies for alleged unpaid royalties.  And the modern move towards streaming services, like Spotify and Jay Z's Tidal, has brought a plethora of cases where artists said they have not been adequately compensated for the use of their music.  In 2015, for example, Spotify was sued for $150m by a group of artists who claimed that the service had reproduced and distributed their music without permission. Tidal, too, has been hit with law suits over the issue.  The Open Music Initiative (OMI) is a newly launched consortium that seeks to leverage blockchain technology to solve disputes like these, but it's far from the only one.  There are a number of companies dedicated to building a blockchain solution for music, including dotblockchain Music (dotBC), Mycelia, MusicChain and UjoMusic, said attorney Jason Epstein, a partner in the Nashville office of Nelson Mullins, where he co-leads the technology and procurement industry group.  OMI is being led by the Berklee College of Music Institute for Creative Entrepreneurship (BerkleeICE) in Boston, in collaboration with the MIT Media Lab and IDEO, and with support from a number of major music labels, media companies, streaming services, publishers, collection societies and nearly 100 other founding entities.  Panos Panay, co-founder of OMI and founding managing director of BerkleeICE told CoinDesk:  ""The objective behind the initiative is to use our academic neutrality and research abilities to advance the process of creating an open protocol.""  If that sounds dense or unfamiliar, you're not alone.  Stuck in the Middle With You  To understand how the blockchain could benefit the music business, it's important to first understand a bit about that industry, Panay notes.  For one, it's a complex mesh of many players, most who stand between the artists and musicians who create the music and the consumers who listen to it.  All of these players – record companies, publishers, streaming service providers – have their own separate databases to keep track of who owns the rights to the music and who is owed what money.  But none of these databases talk to each other. On top of that, ownership of the underlying assets – the composition of the songs as well as the sound recordings of the music – change hands all the time.  Another problem is the ""dynamic and conflicting nature of the metadata itself"", Epstein said.  ""One company's data will have identifiers for works, contributors, recordings and artists as one thing and another company may have different identifiers altogether. Often, there are even conflicts with the data in the same company,"" he continued.  For example, Chuck Berry, Charles Berry and other variations on the name could all be the same person, but might have different identifiers. This makes it very difficult to identify the works and who to pay, Epstein said.  ""This lack of interoperability, coupled with the complexity of the way music is being both created and consumed, has created an issue where hundreds of millions of dollars are not really sent to their rightful owners,"" Panay said in interview.  He sums up the problem, and the opportunity for blockchain, succinctly:  ""Just about every lawsuit you hear about in the music industry is ultimately the result of this lack of uniform way of identifying ownership.""  Ball and Chain  Panay took his argument a step further, suggesting that this design also holds the industry back from its own ability to innovate. The cost of starting a new streaming service, he said, is prohibitively expensive, largely because of rights and licensing.  ""Right now if your music gets played on the radio or in a restaurant or on a streaming service, it takes a minimum of 18 to 20 months to get paid, and when you get paid you have no idea if that is the right or wrong amount,” Panay said.  Panay argues a blockchain-type system could add oversight – a subject he knows about as the founder of Sonicbids, a leading platform for bands to book gigs and market themselves online.  OMI, he said, ""is an attempt that uses the underlying technology of blockchain to effectively create a distributed ledger that enables all of these different databases and applications to interoperate.""  Indeed, the distributed nature of blockchain tech, he said, is ""catalytic"" to making music industry participants excited about joining OMI.  ""The technology is proving critical to getting the players to the table to advance this,"" Panay said. ""For me it's all because of the nature of the underlying technology.""  For example, it sidesteps the past issues that have become apparent when central authorities have entered the equation, Panay said, adding:  ""At its core, this is a distributed ledger where they are able to share data and validate transactions without having to give up their individual sovereignty.""  Nevertheless, blockchain isn’t necessarily a panacea, said Epstein.  ""Tracking royalties and licensing rights is only as good as the metadata associated with the data,"" he explained, suggesting that the solution may lie in combining blockchain with other technologies.  For example, one of his clients, Dart Data, uses machine learning to resolve the dynamic nature of data conflicts, which would facilitate the use of blockchain in the music industry.  Come Together  The exploration, while still in its infancy, has also attracted some major players who you might not associate with the finer arts.  For example, OMI is using Intel's Sawtooth Lake, an active open-source project within Hyperledger, as its reference platform.  Sawtooth Lake is a modular platform for building, deploying and running distributed ledgers. The platform supports customizable data models to capture the current state of the ledger, transaction languages to change the ledger state, and consensus methods to validate transactions.  While that might not sound like the perfect match with OMI's initiative, Reed argues the opposite.  ""We have been encouraged by the banks and the music providers who have collaborated with us,"" he said. ""Both collaborations have informed requirements that will increase the robustness and the versatility of Sawtooth Lake in the future.""  Still, OMI is admittedly a bit of an oddity in comparison to Intel's other work. Intel is a founding member of Hyperledger and is working across its more than 100 members, Reed said.  In addition to starting work with OMI, the company has had success with a bond-trading proof of concept with R3’s banking consortium.  Waiting Game  But how soon until all this becomes reality?  Panay notes that OMI is still in its early stages of development and acceptance. The entire coalition is planning to hold its third technology meeting in New York in the next few weeks to discuss the progress.  ""I would expect between now and the end of the summer we will be able to demonstrate some early prototypes of what this can do,"" Panay said, but noted that it will take a few years to fully implement.  Epstein of Nelson Mullins notes that there are many different data standards for blockchain as well as various and emerging blockchain business models, factors he said will make development slow.  ""It will take some time for those standards and models to develop before enterprises are willing to go all in,"" he said. Over time, however, ""change is inevitable and it is merely a function of how all stakeholders in the industry adopt"".  If the music initiative succeeds in this process, it could have wider implications for other similar creative and entertainment fields, such as book publishing, movies, television and the like.  ""The implications are tremendous for efficiency in terms of payment flows, cutting out intermediaries, the ability of these companies to monetize content,"" Panay said, adding:  ""In most places right now, that's virtually non-monetizeable.""
