Bitcoin, Hash Rate, And Price The Hash Rate is the Bitcoin network&apos;s measuring unit of the computational power and speed used to carry on the mathematical operations that confirm and process transactions on the blockchain. For this reason, the Hash Rate can reflect the global activity of bitcoin mining, increasing or decreasing side by side. The price of Bitcoin and the measure of the Hash Rate are believed to be related. The higher the Hash Rate, the healthier and more secure the network is, and this can lead to an increase in price. However, this is not a guarantee because macroeconomic uncertainty is an important factor that could dominate the future of its trading value. Also, many miners allege that the value of Bitcoin has an impact on the Hash Rate and not the other way around as the miners work around the network -joining or not- depending on the moment&apos;s profitability. Hash Rate And Difficulty Going Up At The Same Time Just one week ago, Bitcoin difficulty hit an all-time high of 29.79 trillion after reaching block height 733,824.

But his Twitter takeover offer may not be as well-received as it looks. Musk, a billionaire and serial entrepreneur, has a history of making sweeping promises but failing to keep them. So it&apos;s not surprising that he has a rocky track record when it comes to keeping his promises. He&apos;s also been notoriously unpredictable. First, he is the richest person on the planet. And so what should we expect from him? After all, he bought a website that affects conversations around the globe. Many billionaires buy media, but the motivation is rarely money-related. Instead, it is a publicity vehicle for their companies. The money he spends on media may pressure governments to help them promote their companies, or they may push back against them. The possibilities are endless. Twitter Might Give Elon Musk A Powerful Bully Pulpit As Elon Musk takeover over Twitter, he might have gained the largest bully pulpit in the world. Despite his history of mistreating (discriminating) employees, breaking the law, and running afoul of the SEC, he has been known to back politicians on both sides of the political spectrum.

42374774,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2i4H,1651705879,Marathon Digital May Start to Sell Some of Its Bitcoin,"Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the world's largest publicly traded bitcoin miners and “hodlers” of the coins it mines, said that it may consider selling some of the bitcoin it holds, but won’t likely do that in the near term.  “We may purchase or sell bitcoin in future periods as needed for treasury management or general corporate purposes,” Marathon Chief Financial Officer Hugh Gallagher said Wednesday during an earnings conference call, although he added that any sale isn't imminent.  “I'll say we don't really have an intention to do that [sell bitcoins] in the near term,” he said, noting that the company is also looking at several other options for financing, including term loans, revolver loans, equipment financing and an at-the-market equity offering.  Read more: Marathon Digital Beats Q1 Sales, EBITDA Estimates  The Las Vegas-based miner last sold its bitcoin in October 2020 and has been accumulating and holding onto its mined bitcoin since then, according to a statement. On Wednesday, Marathon said it holds 9,673 bitcoins with a fair market value of about $366 million.  If Marathon sells some of its bitcoin, it would be in line with its peer, Riot Blockchain (RIOT), which was also a holder, until recently. Riot sold around $10 million worth of bitcoin in April, after selling about $9.4 million worth of the cryptocurrency in March. The company said that it is evaluating the level of coins it retains from its monthly bitcoin mining for its operational and expansion cash requirements.  Selling a few bitcoin to backstop expenses would likely be positive news for Marathon shareholders, because it would be a less expensive means of financing. Recently, equipment financing and bitcoin-backed loans have become an emerging trend among miners, as shareholders have been punishing miners that are raising capital by issuing shares.  Read more: Battered Bitcoin Miners Increasingly Turn to Debt Financing  Marathon didn’t dissect its capital needs, but on the conference call, Gallagher indicated that the miner may need about a half-billion dollars in investments for the remainder of the year for the mining computers it needs to grow for orders that have been made and are planned.  The miner said on its earnings announcement Wednesday that its cash on hand was $118.5 million as of March 31, while its total liquidity, defined as cash on hand plus available revolving credit facilities, was $218.5 million. The miner plans to reach 23.3 exahashes per second (EH/s) in mining power by early 2023.

A decentralized bond is a digital IOU issued on the blockchain, which involves no middleman or intermediary. The digital nature of the bonds allows for wider accessibility and trading, which benefits all parties involved. With decentralized bonds, investors can invest in a new project and receive a return once completed. As the name suggests, these bonds are more secure and transparent than conventional investments. What are Decentralized Bonds? With the emergence of the blockchain and decentralized bond technology, investors and companies will be able to access an open and transparent market that facilitates trade. In addition, decentralized bonds will use Ethereum smart contracts to manage investor money and shares of the underlying business or asset. The idea behind decentralized bonds is simple: investors pool their money to invest in various projects and earn periodic payments. Since the issuer manages the money itself, market fluctuations do not concern investors. While traditional bonds are prone to corporate failure and can lose investors their money, decentralized bonds will provide a steady source of payments regardless of market conditions. A key advantage of decentralized bonds is their high liquidity. Investors can expect monthly payments no matter what happens in the financial markets.

42374772,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2i0V,1651698990,'Revolution' Promised by Tron's Justin Sun Looks Like Clone of Terra's Algorithmic Stablecoin,"Tron, the blockchain founded by entrepreneur Justin Sun in 2017 to compete with Ethereum, will release its algorithmic stablecoin called decentralized USD (USDD) on Thursday.  But reviews are already pouring in from crypto analysts who have glanced at early details of the project and say it mostly looks like a carbon copy of the Terra blockchain’s fast-growing stablecoin, UST.  “It is mechanistically similar to Terra's UST in terms of minting and price stability,” said Dustin Teander, an analyst at digital asset data platform Messari. Kevin Zhou, co-founder of the hedge fund Galois Capital, called it a “LUNA clone,” and Alex Krüger, a popular crypto analyst, echoed his views in a tweet.  Algorithmic stablecoins – cryptocurrencies with a price pegged to another asset, usually to the U.S. dollar by a pre-programmed or ""algorithmic"" incentive mechanism – are suddenly the talk of the town in crypto. The amount outstanding of Terra blockchain’s stablecoin, UST, has swelled to $18 billion from $2 billion. That's partly because of the current financial environment, where inflation is high, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and investors are hunting for high yields. Stablecoins like UST can in many cases be parked in blockchain-based protocols or deposited with crypto lenders for high yields.  Plenty of aspiring market entrants have taken notice of UST's fast growth; Tron's just the latest.  What we know so far  Tron says it also aims to raise $10 billion for TronDAO, a reserve that theoretically could help maintain the dollar peg in a potential market turmoil.  In an open letter on April 21, Sun, Tron's founder and ex-CEO, said that “TRON is starting a self-imposed revolution, pooling all its resources to create USDD, a fully decentralized stablecoin underpinned by mathematics and algorithms, bringing the development of stablecoin to the next level.”  According to USDD’s white paper, the peg will be sustained by creating and destroying USDD supply by a mint-and-burn mechanism and an arbitrage swap.  If the price of USDD falls below $1, users can buy 1 USDD in the external market and then swap 1 USDD for a guaranteed $1 worth of TRX. As a result of the arbitrage, 1 USDD will be burned, and $1 worth of TRX will be minted. Theoretically, as the supply of USDD decreases, USDD's price will increase, to the point where there is no room for arbitrage.  Similarly, if the price of USDD is above $1, users can swap $1 worth of TRX token for 1 USDD in the protocol. This way, 1 USDD will be minted and $1 worth of TRX will be burned, expanding the supply of USDD until its price will go down to the peg.  The white paper also unveils the TRON DAO Reserve, “the first decentralized reserve in the blockchain industry.”  Sun said in the open letter that the reserve “aims to safeguard the overall blockchain industry and crypto market, prevent panic trading caused by financial crises and mitigate severe and long-term economic downturns.”  The white paper says that “upon its establishment, the TRON DAO Reserve will set its basic risk-free interest rate to 30% per annum and facilitate other decentralized and centralized organizations that accept USDD to implement consistent interest rate policies.”  Borrowing the Terra playbook  Does all this sound familiar?  The arbitrage swap of USDD and TRX mirrors Terra's way of maintaining UST stablecoin’s peg with the blockchain’s native token, LUNA.  Read more: What Is LUNA and UST? A Guide to the Terra Ecosystem  The Tron DAO resembles the Luna Foundation Guard’s reserve that supports the UST’s peg, standing at $2 billion with a goal of raising $10 billion.  And the “risk-free” – as the white paper puts it – 30% annual yield is a tool to generate demand for USDD, just as Anchor, a savings and lending protocol on the Terra blockchain, propped up demand for Terra’s stablecoin with a 20% annual yield on deposits in UST.  This week's launch of the Tron algorithmic stablecoin will mark the first of a four-stage road map for USDD, officials say. The full rollout should be complete by the end of this year.  Still, not much else is defined at this point.  “For example, it's not clear what asset the $10 billion reserves will be in or how or when they will be utilized in the system,” Teander said.  Tron didn't reply to questions after multiple requests for comment.  Tron's lackluster track record  So, Tron needs to get users on board quickly to live up to USDD’s lofty goals. How did it fare in the last five years of its existence?  “Historically, Tron has lagged other ecosystems in building out consumer applications,” Teander said.  Data from decentralized finance (DeFi) data platform DefiLlama shows that most of the money locked on the Tron blockchain isn't being used. There’s $4.37 billion deposited – in crypto terms, total value locked – on the Tron blockchain, and the three largest protocols (JustLend, JustStables, SunSwap) make up almost all of the deposits.  JustLend, the biggest of the three, has $1.9 billion of deposits, but only $67 million borrowed, meaning that only 3.5% of the funds are actually used. JustStables, a DeFi system that already issues a dollar-pegged stablecoin (USDJ) on Tron, has $1.3 billion in deposits, but only $288 million in stablecoins were minted. And SunSwap, the third largest protocol, has very little activity outside of trading Tron’s native cryptocurrency, TRX.  Famously, Terra’s yield-earning platform Anchor offers up to a 20% annual yield on deposits, a subsidized rate not sustained by lending revenue and reliant on outside sources to maintain payouts.  Tron aims to outbid Terra by offering 30% annual yield on USDD deposits at the beginning.  “A 30% risk-free rate is a high rate to maintain,"" Teander said. ""Especially if there is no organic income to partially offset the cost.”",NEGATIVE,LUNA | USDD,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | LUNA | TRADING | USDD,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/04/revolution-promised-by-trons-justin-sun-looks-like-clone-of-terras-algorithmic-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad8c98c5dba5297d14f559e94b1e94941533d77b-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374776,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2i6n,1651698945,Crypto Mining Moratorium Faces Stiff Headwinds in Albany,"A bill that aims to put a two-year moratorium on certain types of proof-of-work crypto mining in New York is facing a fresh wave of pushback from industry leaders, lobbyists and lawmakers.  The New York State Assembly version of the bill, sponsored by Democrat Anna Kelles, passed last week. But the Senate version still faces numerous hurdles before potentially being signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul.  The first step? Making it out of the Senate Environmental Conservation committee.  But the bill has fierce opponents within the 11-member committee – including the committee chair, Democrat Todd Kaminsky – who could potentially stop the bill in its tracks.  Kaminsky, a committed environmentalist, authored New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) – a landmark 2019 law that mandated that the state get to 100% zero-emission electricity by 2040.  The goals laid out by the CLCPA have been cited by many of the bill’s proponents – who see energy-intensive proof-of-work crypto mining as a threat to the state’s ambitious climate goals – as the driving force behind the proposed moratorium.  Kaminsky, however, doesn’t see things that way.  “I really believe in a new green economy and fighting climate change,” Kaminsky told CoinDesk. “The question we have to ask is, ‘How much will this law go toward helping us reach our climate goals versus harming a nascent industry that I feel is going to be increasingly critical to our state’s economy?’”  “I’d like to do everything we can to make crypto mining more eco-friendly, and there’s great innovators doing that now,” Kaminsky added. “But I think this will be seen as extremely hostile … I think it’s going to lead to really deleterious economic consequences for New York if people perceive it as being hostile to crypto.”  Economic impact  The potential economic impact of a moratorium has been a sticking point for other lawmakers as well, including Assemblyman Clyde Vanel, a Democrat from Queens, and Senator Jeremy Cooney, a Democrat from Rochester.  Vanel and Cooney spoke out against the bill at a rally in Albany on Monday hosted by the Blockchain Association.  Alongside representatives from the crypto industry and trade unions – including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), whose opposition hobbled last year’s version of the bill – the lawmakers expressed their concerns that a moratorium would result in a loss of jobs and economic opportunities for underserved communities in upstate New York.  Rochester, which is one of the poorest cities in the U.S., could be particularly vulnerable to the impact of the moratorium. Representatives for Foundry, a crypto mining company headquartered in Rochester, also showed up to protest the bill on Monday. (Foundry is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Foundry has said that a moratorium could “take New York out of the game” for crypto mining and slow the company’s plans for expansion – including the addition of new, high-paying tech jobs.  Vanel told CoinDesk the loss of these jobs is a big concern for him and other lawmakers.  “I myself was skeptical that crypto mining could bring quality jobs until I went to see these places for myself,” Vanel told CoinDesk. “But then I saw people without advanced degrees doing advanced degree jobs.”  “There’s all this economic activity,” Vanel added. “We should make sure we work with the industry to create change if we don’t want to push the industry out of New York to other states.”  Republican Senator Anthony Palumbo, a longtime member of the Environmental Conservation Committee, told CoinDesk he wants the state legislature to find a way to strike the correct balance between environmental protection and economic opportunity.  “I don’t think a moratorium is the right answer,” Palumbo said.  “I am definitely an environmentalist, and I get that we do need to reduce our carbon footprint and maybe transition to renewables, but it still needs to be done smartly and reliably,” he added.  Bad policy?  Many in the crypto industry – as well as a growing number of lawmakers – have pushed back against the bill for being “bad policy” that unfairly targets the crypto industry.  “When any industry is perceived as being singled out, it’s a problem,” Kaminsky told CoinDesk. “And you have to have a really good justification for it.”  “It’s just a weird universe where we’re telling a crypto miner that they can’t be crypto mining, but some rubber plant down the road can be burning things without any similar moratorium,” he said.  Instead, Kaminsky told CoinDesk he wants to create change and transition the entire economy to more climate-friendly alternatives without singling out any one industry.  “I do want the industry to move off fossil fuels,” Kaminsky said. “The question is, can we do that with them as opposed to doing it to them?”  To advance, the bill has to be considered and passed by the Senate Environmental Conservation committee.  However, it remains unclear when – or if – that will happen.  The committee only has one more meeting this legislative session, the agenda for which will be published on Thursday.

Otherdeed for Otherside, Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs have a combined volume activity of 34,945 ether (ETH) or approximately $100 million.  On May 4, Yuga Labs announced it has refunded gas fees to those whose transactions failed during the Otherside NFT sale over the weekend.  Meanwhile, savvy cryptocurrency traders have been accumulating LOOKS, the LooksRare NFT marketplace token, and decreasing their bag of rETH.  In the past 24 hours, $1.08 million worth of LOOKS has entered into addresses labeled by Nansen as “smart money,” more than any other token monitored by the firm. Typically, inflows are a signal of rising asset prices.  Nansen considers a wallet to be “smart money” if it meets at least one of several conditions, including:  It is known to belong to an investment fund  It has made at least $100,000 by providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, SushiSwap and Uniswap, excluding so-called impermanent loss  It has made multiple profitable trades on a decentralized exchange (DEX) in a single transaction, through mechanisms such as “flash loans”  LOOKS is the native token that fuels the LooksRare NFT marketplace, a rising competitor for OpenSea.  LooksRare collects a 2% service fee in WETH on all NFT transactions. Of those fees, 100% are distributed among LOOKS staking participants. Moreover, buyers and sellers are incentivized to list and trade NFTs on LooksRare as a way to earn LOOKS tokens.  Currently, LooksRare has roughly 75,000 total users.  Tuesday, Rocket Pool’s rETH staking token had the largest inflow into smart money wallets. Today’s data, however, tells a different story. Over the past 24-hour period, roughly $1.53 million worth of rETH has moved out of smart money wallets, the biggest outflow among tokens monitored by Nansen.  rETH is Rocket Pools’ token representing a user’s staked ether. The outflow of rETH coincides with Lido, the leading staking solution and Rocket Pools’ competitor, briefly overtaking Curve in total locked value (TVL).  Nansen is one of many firms that parse publicly available information about crypto transactions, although unlike Chainanalysis and similar firms, its services are geared toward giving investors an edge rather than helping law enforcement catch bad actors.  While cryptocurrency addresses appear on public blockchains as random-seeming strings of letters and numbers, Nansen uses algorithms, its own investigations and information submitted by users to draw inferences about the entities behind pseudonymous wallets.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | RPL,Sage D.

Marathon’s first-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $39.4 million versus the consensus estimate of $38 million, according to FactSet.  Its GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $13 million, or 13 cents per share, versus net income of $83.4 million, or 87 cents per share, in the prior year quarter.  The first quarter included $19.6 million in impairment charges related to its self-mined bitcoin, and a $5.5 million decrease in the fair market value of the company’s investment fund.  “Given the progress we have made to date in deploying behind the meter, we believe we will be through our backlog of miners and fully back on track with deployments before the end of this year, keeping us on pace to reach 23.3 [exahashes per second] by early 2023,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO.

Embracing risk over the short term  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index ticked lower into ""extreme fear"" territory, indicating a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders.  The index has remained in ""fear"" territory over the past few months, marking a decisive shift in ""extreme greed"" sentiment in November of last year.  An increase in trader sentiment would require a rise in BTC's price, with a gradual increase in trading volume and volatility. Generally, high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis indicate bullish activity, according to Alternative.me, which constructs the index.  Bitcoin's dominance, or BTC's market capitalization relative to the total crypto market cap, accounts for 10% of the Fear & Greed Index.  BTC is outperforming alternative cryptos (altcoins) so far this year, but gave up some of its lead in the past few days.

The largest individual refund was 2.6 ETH (around $7,500), with the firm spending 0.26 ETH (around $783) in gas fees to send out all the refunds.  The refund may be the sole lauded choice Yuga Labs has made around the debut land sale for its upcoming “Otherside” metaverse, after the initial launch of 55,000 NFTs caused investors to pay over $100 million in Ethereum transaction fees.  Yuga had announced the refund days in advance and warned of potential phishing scams impersonating the firm, which users have reported to be widespread over the past few days.  To reduce scam potential on the back end of the refund, Yuga tapped MultiSender to redistribute the funds. MultiSender is a dapp that does not require wallets to interact with or confirm a contract before receiving a payment.  Following the many technical difficulties of the launch, Yuga alluded to potentially moving its metaverse from Ethereum to its own chain, though details on that development have not been clarified in the days since then.

42420820,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcSD,1651690668,Wall Street Goes Crypto in the Bahamas,"The first FTX/SALT Crypto Bahamas conference had lofty goals.  “The vibe we were going after was ‘Crypto Sun Valley,’” Amy Wu, head of FTX Ventures, told CoinDesk on the event’s opening day, referring to Idaho’s annual “summer camp” for billionaires. “It’s going a lot better than we thought.”  Indeed, the lineup was star-studded: Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen headlined alongside former heads of state Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Throughout the four-day affair, crypto whales mingled with Wall Street elites.  But perhaps the biggest celebrity of all was FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was met with cheers and applause during his several on-stage appearances. If anything, the event was a testament to his crypto empire’s growing might and an extended opportunity to show off his unconventional star power.  “Sam’s a polymath, an exceptional thinker,” said Anthony Scaramucci, the hedge fund titan and SALT founder widely known for his brief stint as President Donald Trump’s communications director. “He knows more about politics than anyone.”  In the past year, Bankman-Fried has become an unofficial spokesperson of sorts for the entire crypto industry, amassing a personal fortune of $24 billion, testifying before the U.S. Congress on regulatory issues and regularly going viral on social media.  Scaramucci says FTX approached SALT with the idea to co-host a crypto-themed conference in the Bahamas after FTX’s partnership with SALT New York last September was a success for the exchange.  Last fall, FTX relocated from Hong Kong to the Bahamas, bringing with it a growing cabal of some of crypto’s best and brightest.  The boomers are coming  The diversity in attendance was no more evident than the disparity in dress code.  In the opening remarks, Bankman-Fried, clad in his usual FTX tee, cargo shorts and crew-length white socks, stood beside Scaramucci, who donned a navy Brioni suit.  “There’s a wide variety of people here, everyone from Bill Clinton to degens with monkey [non-fungible tokens],” said Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of the layer 1 blockchain Near.  “This is a crypto conference for adults,” said Scott Freeman, founder of JST Capital, a crypto asset management firm. “Crypto has been in a bear market for the past five months, but you wouldn’t know it from being here. There’s still a lot of energy. Nobody cares about the price of bitcoin.”  In his opening remarks, Scaramucci cracked several self-deprecating jokes about “boomers” and urged Wall Streeters to be more open-minded toward new technologies.  “When you’re a young guy, you never think you’re going to be old one day,” Anthony Scaramucci, 58, told CoinDesk. “Now, I’m a f***ing fossil. The world is moving forward, I don’t want to leave my generation behind.”  Wall Streeters, who have once been among crypto’s harshest critics, have been softening their stances towards cryptocurrencies, and in some cases, outright embracing the sector.  Both Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan (JPM) and Citadel’s Ken Griffin have both previously called out crypto for its ties to criminal activity or dismissed the asset class as mere speculation, only to reverse course in the past year.  “Traditional financial firms don’t want to be the first one, but they also don’t want to be the last one,” said Raymond Yuan, founder of CTH Group, on a panel discussion called “Crypto Alpha: Investing in Megatrends” alongside Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu and Matrixport co-founder Jihan Wu.  Zhu, who told CoinDesk he only goes to one or two conferences a year, said he decided to come to Crypto Bahamas due to the sheer concentration of whales (those with large crypto holdings) in attendance, as opposed to the more retail or developer-oriented conferences.  Read more: Three Arrows Capital to Move Headquarters to Dubai, Raise External Capital  “People have been saying for a while, ‘Crypto needs to grow up,’ and now, it’s grown up!” said Kyle Samani, founder of crypto venture capital firm Multicoin Capital, one of the Solana ecosystem’s most prodigious backers.  Bahamas leads the way  Crypto entrepreneurs have tended towards clustering in tropical paradises – from Miami to Puerto Rico to Bali. Now, the Bahamas is throwing its hat into the ring.  In the week preceding the conference, the nation of 400,000 unveiled a white paper outlining its regulatory framework for digital assets, which was soon followed by FTX’s groundbreaking ceremony for its new offices in Nassau.  “FTX’s presence in the Bahamas has demonstrated that the Bahamas is open for business to the crypto world,” Prime Minister Philip Davis told CoinDesk.  Prime Minister Davis added that U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chair of the House Committee on Financial Services, visited the Bahamas the previous weekend to discuss crypto, among other agenda items.  “The U.S. has realized they are later than most to the digital currency space, that was evident,” said Bahamas Attorney General L. Ryan Pinder of the meeting with Waters.  “She recognized that we were rather progressive,” Pinder told CoinDesk. “She extended a future invitation, if the Bahamas would like to testify in Congress to talk about their experience.”  The Bahamas is one of the only countries where exchanges can obtain a license for both crypto derivatives and the spot market.  Ryan Salame, co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, says that making the Bahamas a new hub for crypto was one goal of the conference.  “The Bahamas is staying at the forefront,” he told CoinDesk. “A lot of jurisdictions that want to be hubs aren’t building out the regulatory infrastructure.”  Other sources told CoinDesk FTX’s decision to relocate became more urgent after Hong Kong began enforcing a strict three-week travel quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic, a rule that would disrupt Bankman-Fried’s extensive travel schedule.  The FTX founder said on stage that he spends over 50% of his time thinking about crypto regulation, and frequently visits Washington, D.C., to meet with regulators.  A nod to the devs  In addition to the panels and parties, Crypto Bahamas hosted a hackathon for Solana ecosystem developers.  Serum and Pyth, both protocols built on Solana, co-headlined the hacker house, which was less a house and more a darkened hotel ballroom set up with monitor rigs, catered coffee and loud DJ music.  The room drew over 500 registrants, according to Michelle Sun, a core contributor to Serum, a decentralized exchange on Solana founded by Bankman-Fried.  Solana “really speaks the language of TradFi,” said Sun. “So many of the builders I meet are former Wall Street traders or bankers who decided to build their protocols on Solana.”  Sun, who also resides in the Bahamas, says Serum recently opened a coworking space in the Bahamas adjacent to the FTX offices to accommodate visiting developers.  “It’s a really inclusive and supportive environment,” said Claire Song, a core contributor to Cell Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project on Solana. “Michelle helped me connect with developer teams building similar DeFiprotocols.”  Song says she became interested in building on Solana because it was one of the few blockchains that uses an order book-based exchange, as opposed to the popular automated market makers (AMMs) such as Uniswap, Sushiswap and Curve that have so far dominated DeFi.  “The AMM model has a lot of limitations – you can’t trade derivatives or apply quant trading strategies,” explained Song. “AMMs are easy to use, but not flexible. That’s why we like Solana, because it has an order book.”  Solana ecosystem heavy-hitters were also in attendance, including co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokol, as well as a 14-year-old Solana intern, Gajesh Gaik.  The young Rust enthusiast, who has become a bit of a celebrity in the crypto community, told CoinDesk he is working on Taksh, a no-loss lottery game built on Solana.  Gaik says he doesn’t attend classes back home in India, and instead spends his time building on Solana, as long as he passes his mandatory school exams every four months.  “I got to meet a lot of people from Crypto Twitter,” said Gaik, who appeared to be having the most fun at the conference out of the dozens of attendees speaking to CoinDesk.  When asked what he enjoys most about the Solana ecosystem, the 14-year-old wunderkind responded, with no hesitation: “The vibes.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/wall-street-goes-crypto-in-the-bahamas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f4ba1b819ecbabdec630a5ead20c8b511816e14-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421594,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoi6v,1651688754,"Matt Taibbi, PayPal's Deplatforming and the Case for Crypto","Veteran magazine journalist Matt Taibbi just reported out the case for bitcoin (BTC) – perhaps without knowing it. On Tuesday, the Rolling Stone alumnus, known for his acerbic prose and a writing style reminiscent of Hunter S. Thompson’s, published a new story about how PayPal (PYPL), the internet payments giant replete with its own founding “mafia,” has selectively deplatformed alternative media sites.  The story, “PayPal's IndyMedia Wipeout,” focuses on alt publishers Consortium News and MintPress, which Taibbi said have been consistently anti-war and critical (with the earned opinion from doing actual reporting) of U.S. intelligence agencies.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But Taibbi is making a grander claim about censorship, and how it has recently moved from just the inconsistent, poorly explained suppression or boosting of online content to something more perverse: financial strangulation.  Taibbi writes:  “Going after cash is a big jump from simply deleting speech, with a much bigger chilling effect. This is especially true in the alternative media world, where money has long been notoriously tight, and the loss of a few thousand dollars here or there can have a major effect on a site, podcast, or paper.”  See also: Why I'm Skeptical of FATF's 'Extreme Right Wing' Watch | Opinion  As readers of CoinDesk may already know, Taibbi isn’t tilting at windmills. Authorities are increasingly willing, it seems, to quash dissent through financial machinations – like during the Canadian Truckers protest where hundreds of mostly peaceful (if loud) protestors lost access to bank accounts without due process.  A similar sea change happened after SWIFT took the unprecedented move to cut Russia’s central bank from its global financial messaging service. Taken together, the two stories show how any pariahs operating with the U.S. dollar-denominated economy could be choked off.  The threat grows more severe in his mind now that the U.S. has its own “ministry of truth,” and as the government is increasingly willing to publicly say who or what is worth hearing.  As Taibbi said: “Deleting posts or censoring content is one thing, threatening an organization’s existence is another.” He also quotes MintPress founder and executive director Mnar Adley correctly placing this “current era of content moderation” as beginning with “PayPal’s historic decision in 2010 to halt donations to Wikileaks.”  Unsaid was how this moment in time led to a bifurcated path. There’s the tightly managed, heavily surveilled ecosystem of established media and powerbrokers, and its underbelly, the world of crypto.  Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto famously pleaded people to not fund WikiLeaks using his creation, thinking it would draw a “hornets’ nest” of suppression from the government to shutdown Bitcoin before it really got going.  Of course, bitcoin was already then bigger than its founder, and people decided to fund WikiLeaks anyway. Crypto today is still a primary source of funding for WikiLeaks, as it is for many offbeat operations like SciHub and Gab.  See also: Blackballed by PayPal, Scientific-Paper Pirate Takes Bitcoin  This is crypto at its best – functioning, non-state aligned financial rails open for anyone’s use.  Alternatives?  Writers like Taibbi have been notably skeptical or silent about crypto, perhaps hoping that some alternative system will come along that offers similar solutions without crypto’s libertarian baggage.  And, indeed, there has been notable growth in that regard. In the reporter’s sphere alone, there are figures like Saagar Enjeti and Krystal Ball who fund a growing “alternative mainstream” media ecosystem (by which they mean they pay friends and politically aligned voices to do occasional reporting or commentary) through subscriptions.  Matt Taibbi is another example, who, after an ill-fated stint at The Intercept, was able to leave the pages of Rolling Stone magazine for Substack.  Insofar as Enjeti, Ball, Taibbi and others still have to clear their paychecks in dollars, however, they might still find similar financial exclusion (or at least the threat of it). Substack has owners and investors, and though the email platform seems committed to allowing a diversity of writers to use its financial system – ultimately, they only have their reputation to fall back on. The world waits for when it will finally be attractive enough to cash that in.  There is a sense that all of this could blow up in “the establishment’s” face – that in seeking to diminish or destroy critics it could instead be directing them support – if viable alternatives exist. The Streisand effect was in play recently, with some $25,354 in donations flooding to Consortium News after its PayPal was cut. That may be nearly halfway to Consortium’s $60,000 spring pledge drive, but something tells me it needs something a little more sustainable.  Crypto comes with its own problems – its environmental footprint, its weird politico-economic cults, its never-ending series of Ponzi-like scams – and I’d be thrilled if its use was kept to only the marginalized, only those who need it most (rather than onboarding the world).  See also: Humans Are the Last-Mile Problem of Bitcoin Crowdfunding | Opinion  But it’s not for me to say who should or shouldn’t use it or for what, that’s its strength and hopefully it will be there for anyone when they need it.

42374786,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2iJN,1651688001,"Fed Hikes Rate at Fastest Pace in 22 Years, Will Start Shrinking Balance Sheet","In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve raised the official U.S. interest rate by half a percentage point, while saying it will reduce the size of its balance sheet by $47.5 billion a month for three months and going up to $95 billion a month starting in September, according to a statement Wednesday from the Federal Open Market Committee.  During a press conference following the decision, Fed chair Jerome Powell also said that ""50 basis points should be on the table for the next couple meetings,” and that a 75 basis-point rate hike is not something the committee is considering right now.  The moves come as inflation surges to its highest in four decades, a dynamic that's being closely tracked by bitcoin (BTC) traders, because the largest cryptocurrency is seen by many as a hedge against rising consumer prices.  “Inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing,” Jerome Powell said. “We’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down.”  The price of bitcoin (BTC) rose 2.77% after Powell's remarks, from $38,716 to $39,790 at press time.  The interest rate on Fed funds, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans, will go up to a range of between 0.75% and 1%. The Fed had cut the rate to zero in March 2020 to stimulate markets when coronavirus-related lockdowns struck the economy and had held it there until earlier this year. This is the first time the Fed has raised the rate by 0.5% in one meeting since 2000.  ""The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain,"" the Fed statement reads. ""The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity.""  Institutional outflows in bitcoin hit an all-time high ahead of the meeting as market participants are waiting for another capitulation before returning to the market, according to Scott Bauer, a former Goldman Sachs trader who's now CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.  Fed projections  In March, Fed officials released quarterly economic projections and a so-called “dot plot” showing that the median expectation for the Fed funds rate at the end of 2022 was for at least seven 25-basis point hikes over the course of 2022, which would push the rate up to 2.8%.  The 50-basis point interest rate hike comes as no surprise since Chair Powell had already hinted at the possibility of a more aggressive rate hike than the usual 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point. Investors and traders, however, were waiting for a detailed plan on how quickly and vigorously the central bank would shrink its bond holdings.  Shrinking the amount of Treasury bonds it bought during the pandemic by $35 billion in each of the next three months and $60 billion per month starting in September is a far more aggressive approach than when the Fed reduced its holdings in 2017-2018. Back then, the Fed reduced its balance sheet by roughly $50 billion per month.  The Fed will let up to $17.5 billion of mortgage bonds roll off the balance sheet in each of the next three months, going up to $35 billion a month starting in September, according to a separate statement published by the central bank on its plans.  Reducing the balance sheet aggressively, “if not handled adroitly,” could result in deeper disturbances in the bond market, according to Scott MacDonald, chief economist at Smith's Research & Gradings. Analysts were closely watching the 10-year Treasury yield, which hit 3% for the first time since 2018 on Monday, as traders prepared for the Fed meeting.  “This is all about regaining the market's confidence,” MacDonald said. ”The Fed has stumbled and let the horse out of the barn. Now it has to reassure people that inflation is not going to gallop away and the economy plunges into a recession.”  With this hawkish stance by the central bank, fears of a recession have become more tangible, as gross domestic product growth slowed to 1.4% in the first quarter. Two straight quarters of declines in GDP would mean a recession.  Analysts expect Powell to provide guidance on the overall state of the economy during a press conference that follows the Fed's policy announcement at 2:30 pm ET.

The largest cryptocurrency rose 1.9% in the past 24 hours to around $38,931 as of press time.  “Although the Fed is widely expected to increase rates by 50 basis points,” said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Analytics, “this is not a given, and any move outside of this is likely to have a disproportionate market impact.”  “Any announcement of reduction of its balance sheet faster than natural expiration of debt will also likely have an impact on markets,” Deane said. “In normal times, we'd expect major indices to fall on the news (or the rumor beforehand) but these are far from normal times and ‘unpredictable’ is the most appropriate term.""  “In terms of bitcoin,” Deane said, “We maintain our position that it will stay range bound for the time being, with a long-term outlook remaining bullish.""  “Today is set up for huge volatility, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meet to announce their decision on how much they will raise rates by,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock in a newsletter. “This event has led most investors to sell equities and crypto over the past month, as they fear a 50-basis point rate hike, which seems highly likely.”  “This event could be priced in,” Sotiriou wrote. “Although hiking rates is generally bad in these conditions for risk-on assets, U.S. consumer data is strong at the moment, so I remain optimistic that the result of this hike will not be catastrophic and that this FOMC meeting has been priced in.""

The exchange unveiled the marketplace to a small group of invited users at the end of April, nearly seven months after announcing its launch in October 2021.  The marketplace saw just 900 transactions and 73 ETH (around $210,000) of sales volume in the debut week of its beta, though Coinbase did not say how many users had been granted access to the platform.  Coinbase NFT will look to take a chunk of market share from the NFT marketplace kingpin OpenSea, debuting with zero-transaction fees for a limited time, the company’s vice president of product, Sanchan Saxena, said last month during a press briefing.  The company says it plans to grow its user base in part with a series of NFT collection partnerships tying back to the platform, one of which is a Bored Ape Yacht Club film trilogy to debut at NFT.NYC in June.

42374771,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2i31,1651685999,‘SmartMint’ NFT Tool Gives Artists Ownership of Minting Smart Contracts,"Web 3 protocol Pastel said Wednesday it is launching its beta version SmartMint, a no-code non-fungible token (NFT) minting service for the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Pastel platforms.  SmartMint seeks to streamline NFT minting while fostering decentralization by giving project leads ownership over their infrastructure, Pastel co-founder Anthony Georgiades told CoinDesk in a phone interview.  Because deploying NFT smart contracts requires a background in coding – often in languages unique to a certain blockchain – deployers instead tap custodial marketplaces that own the smart contract, something that Georgiades said is an “intrinsic issue.”  While marketplaces force users to be “beholden to smart contract standards,” SmartMint allows users to customize their smart contracts and own them, which enables greater decentralization, Georgiades said.  SmartMint allows users to upload an image, add metadata properties and select a chain to mint on, much like the minting experience on a custodial exchange. But in the background SmartMint deploys a smart contract owned by the user, a major difference.  Marketplaces such as OpenSea offer NFT minting and listing in one place. Although SmartMint users must list their NFTs elsewhere if they want to sell them, they own the smart contracts attached to their newly minted assets rather than the marketplace.  SmartMint has also integrated two security protocols, including Sense, which vets NFTs to sniff out counterfeit duplicates; and Cascade, which protects users’ NFT data, according to Georgiades.  SmartMint’s beta version will last for three weeks before the product becomes available to the public. During the beta period, users who sign up for the program will be able to whitelist their username and Ethereum address to access the platform, Georgiades said.  SmartMint is free to use, despite gas fees associated with minting on various blockchains. As for resales, Pastel told CoinDesk via email that SmartMint will receive 2.5% fee on the first sale of the NFT and 1% fee on secondary sales.  Pastel is a layer-1 blockchain protocol that specializes in NFTs. Its native token is Pastel (PSL).  According to Georgiades, SmartMint plans to soon incorporate a “handful of networks,” such as Avalanche, Cosmos, Kadena and Oasis.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC | SOL,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/smartmint-nft-tool-gives-artists-ownership-of-minting-smart-contracts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8c4372e30290a5dc91d95beb7b5f30a3aab8674-1218x781.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374792,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2iKd,1651682111,Binance Secures Regulatory Approval in France,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has secured regulatory approval in France, according to a release from France's capital market regulator, the AMF (Autorité des marchés financiers).  Binance is now a registered Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) in France and will be permitted to custody digital assets; facilitate the purchase, sale and exchange of such assets; and operate a trading platform for them. It is Binance's first such license in Europe, according to a company blog post.  The company is expanding its global operations, having obtained provisional approval to operate as a broker-dealer in virtual assets in Abu Dhabi last month.  Binance has never previously had a single headquarters owing to its decentralized ethos, something that does not sit well with regulatory bodies, who regard it as lacking accountability. This came to a head last year when a string of regulatory bodies across the world issued warnings that Binance was not authorized to operate in their markets.  In March and April, the company obtained approval to operate in Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  ""When we first started, we wanted to embrace the decentralized philosophy of no offices, no headquarters, no corporate entities,” Binance founder Changpeng Zhao said at the Financial Times’s Crypto and Digital Assets Summit in April. ""As soon as you want to get licenses, you have to have the traditional structures, which we do now,"" he added.  Binance has invested 100 million euros (US$108 million) in its operations in France, including a partnership with a Paris-based startup incubator Station F. It also has offices in the U.K., where the Financial Conduct Authority said it wasn’t able to regulate the company.

These digital coins offer immersive experiences, and AI can detect trends and adjust parameters on the fly.

This, in turn, encourages new customer buy-in and retention. As a result, the AI-generated NFTs market is growing rapidly. The developers of Art AI created an algorithm for producing NFTs based on a large collection of artwork.

All miners will have to submit business registration data, along with information about personnel, the power they consume or plan to consume, IP addresses used, their planned investments, the location of the mine, a copy of the cargo customs declaration or a document confirming that they obtained the equipment legally, technical conditions for connection to the electricity supply and confirmation that persons involved are residents of Kazakhstan, among other documents, according to the order.  New miners have to file the information 30 days before starting operations, and any mines that close down will have to inform authorities within 10 days of ceasing operations. Existing miners have to file the required information every quarter.  The regulations come as an amendment to an order from the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry from October 2020. The order was signed on April 29.  Alan Dorjiyev, president of Kazakhstan's Association of Blockchain and Data Centers Industry, told CoinDesk that this is the first step ""towards officially approving the supply of electricity to legal mining data centers."" The national grid operator cut off power to mines in January.  Existing miners will also have to inform authorities about the number and type of mining rigs used, the order said.  Kazakhstan has been struggling with energy shortages, in part due to the influx of crypto miners to the energy-rich Central Asian state. Authorities have been trying to root out mining operations that do not have proper licensing to reduce the load on the country's energy grid. In March, they announced the closure of 106 mines, seizing 67,000 machines worth $193 million.  This is the ""first step of regulations,"" which sets out official rules for how to conduct mining business in Kazakhstan, Didar Bekbauov, co-founder of local miner Xive.io, told CoinDesk.

Since the start of April, bitcoin funds have suffered a cumulative $310 million of redemptions, though for 2022 to date the funds are still sitting on a cumulative $120 million of net inflows.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell from about $40,000 to the $38,000 level over the past week, appearing to trade in sync with U.S. stocks as the Federal Reserve pushed to tighten monetary policy in the face of soaring inflation.

Multi-asset focused funds saw an inflow of $1.9 million, continuing a streak that dates back to early January. Multi-asset funds now account for 8% of all assets under management, the largest behind bitcoin- and ether-focused funds, according to CoinShares.

It is designed to be resistant to collusion by most miners. This means that censors cannot exclude targeted transactions because most of them would act in unison. Even worse, colluding miners would be vulnerable to debilitating attacks. Censorship-resistant protocols have features that make them impossible to censor. Many static analyses are expensive and pose a DoS vector. A CREP is important for decentralized cryptoeconomic systems. A CREP prevents the censors from altering any transaction made on the blockchain. This means that any party can transact on the network without worrying about government interference. Censorship-resistant protocols also make it impossible for censors to prevent any transaction from taking place on the network. It is also crucial for functioning financial protocols such as contracts for difference. Turing Complete Turing-complete is an additional feature to the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), meaning that it can encapsulate any type of computation. This means it can loop through two methods: using the JUMP instruction to conditionally jump to a different location within a data structure or through &apos;recursion.&apos; Additionally, Ethereum contracts can call other contracts, potentially looping through recursion.

Bundlr’s funding round was led by Framework Ventures, Hypersphere Ventures and Permanent Ventures, and it also saw participation from OpenSea and Race Capital.

42411121,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gizUaR,1651675487,'I Totally Obsessed Over It.' How Crypto Addiction Almost Ruined My Life,"How many times a day do you check crypto prices? How often do you obsessively read crypto Twitter? Has it hurt your relationships? Has it caused you to loaf at your job?  Or to cut to the quick: Are you addicted to crypto?  For most people, thankfully, the answer is that crypto is rarely a full-fledged addiction that requires treatment or a deep bout of soul searching. But sometimes it’s serious. Sometimes it can ruin lives.  Theo de Vries is the Managing Director of The Diamond Rehab, a drug and alcohol treatment center located in Thailand, and he also treats patients for crypto addiction. Or more accurately, the addiction is usually a combination of crypto and something else. “People inquire because they’re addicted to cocaine and crypto,” said de Vries as an example. “People say ‘I have an alcohol problem, and I also have a crypto problem.’”  Crypto addiction is essentially a gambling addiction. “We treat it the same way,” said de Vries. He acknowledges that some people dismiss gambling as “an almost laughable addiction,” but notes that when it’s acute and extreme, gambling has the “highest suicide rate of all the addictions.”  But enough generalities. To give a starker picture of how crypto addiction can impact someone’s life, we spoke to an actual patient of de Vries’ who was willing to share his story. The patient is 38, has two young kids, owns a marketing company and chose to remain anonymous for obvious reasons.  This is his story.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  How did this all begin?  In 2016 I heard about Ethereum. And I bought a lot. And then a friend bought all of these other cryptocurrencies; I got really excited and I started buying altcoins. And before I knew it, every day for the entire day, my whole mind was devoted to finding the next new coin.  Were you day trading?  No, I never really did any trading, it was more buying into projects. But I spent all day studying all of these new projects. I was in all of these Facebook groups and talking to other people. I’m very nontechnical, so it cost me a lot of time and frustration to learn about everything. At some point it got quite out of hand, but it was still manageable.  How so exactly?  I could see my daily work suffering. But I was also making really good money from it, because everything was going up. My girlfriend was saying, “You’re spending all of this time on the computer. What do you do all day?” But I still thought everything was fine. In hindsight it wasn’t fine, but it felt okay in that moment.  When did things shift?  I got hacked. I was very careless. I had bought a Ledger [crypto wallet], but I never opened it, and my crypto was all on an online MyEtherWallet. It got hacked, and I lost almost everything.  How much did you lose?  At the time it was a few hundred thousand dollars.  I’m sorry man. And I hate to ask this, but does that mean that in today’s dollars, it’d be worth millions?  Yeah. That’s correct.  That’s a hell of a gut punch.  Yeah. Yeah. [long pause.] Yeah. And I also felt stupid because people had warned me, “Don’t keep it all in your online wallet.” But I was too lazy. So maybe that’s a good lesson for others. Make sure you invest the time in crypto security.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Addicted to Crypto?  It sounds like up to this point, crypto might have been time intensive, but it hadn’t really caused any big problems in your life, besides the hack. So what happened next?  Then it really started to get out of hand. I tried to win that money back. I wanted to find the next new gem.  The next coin that would “100X”?  Yeah. And I thoroughly obsessed over it. And I knew that I couldn’t just put in a few hundred dollars, because to recoup all the money I had lost, then it would need to 2,000X. I needed to put in more money.  In the beginning, before the hack, I had my own business and was making good money. I had plenty of disposable income. That’s all I invested into crypto. But then, after the hack, when I needed more money, I started getting creative on getting more funds.  How so?  At first I took out a loan. And this was a really ugly loan, where you pay a lot of interest. And then I started to get letters about the loan. And my girlfriend started to worry. And then I asked for a loan from my friends. Then my parents. Then came the stealing, which is a part I’m really not proud of. This was the last straw.  Can you share what happened? How’d you approach your friends and family for money?  I was a bit ashamed about always talking enthusiastically about crypto, so when I asked to borrow money I said something like, “Hey, I have this problem with my bank account.” Or since people knew that I had my own business, I’d say something like, “Hey, I’m waiting for money from this client.” Or maybe “I’m just waiting for a few invoices to clear, so I just need a bit of money for this one-off situation.” And then I’d use that money for crypto.  And you’d put the money in some new altcoin?  Yeah. It was a lie.  How did you approach your parents?  My parents were always really nice to me. Super nice people. Maybe too nice. And for my parents, I was too embarrassed to ask them for a loan. And I knew the pin code for my mother’s bank account and her bank card. At one point I stole some money. It wasn’t even a huge amount, but I was kind of desperate. I really wanted to get into a certain project, and I didn’t have enough money. So I stole from them.  Did your mom ever find out what happened?  Yeah. She was of course very disappointed, and she also doubted herself. She asked herself, “What did I do wrong in raising you?” She thought it was her fault. So that was very painful.  How did all of this affect your relationship with your girlfriend?  It was a very bad time. If I was in her shoes, I would have walked. But she was very supportive even though the relationship got very bad. She found out about everything. I told her everything.  What was the addiction itself like?  I was checking prices often, but that wasn't even the biggest problem. I totally obsessed over it, and I was always watching YouTube videos. Constantly scheming and thinking about, “What's the next big thing?” And I spent a lot of time in these Facebook groups and following these sort of “gurus,” and investigating everything.  How did it affect your work?  Because I have my own business, I also have a lot of freedom. And at this point, I was only doing crypto. I was doing the very bare minimum to keep the company afloat. I’d skip meetings. I just didn’t pay any attention at all to the company. That got really bad.  See also: Ben Munster - The Men Who Stare at Charts  And at one point, my girlfriend said, ""Yeah, you need to find some help."" I found help and got into rehab for it.  What was the rehab like?  I went to an expensive one; my parents paid for it. They did a lot of one-on-one sessions. They really tried to get at the root cause of the problem. ""Why did you want to make all of this money?” I was kind of surprised when they said, ""We're going to treat this as a gambling addiction.""  How did your behavior change?  At the beginning I thought, “Maybe I can just go through this rehab, and then maybe I'll just behave like a ‘regular’ with crypto.” You know, stay off these small projects I was obsessing over. But the rehab’s message was, “You really have a big problem. You should stop doing crypto, period.”  Did you stop?  Yeah. And as you can imagine that was tough, especially in the bull run. That was really tough. But now I just know that I can’t do it anymore. I just can’t go online. I know that if I go snooping again looking for new projects and new strategies, that will get out of hand.  How do you maintain that discipline?  They [the treatment center] taught me how to focus on other things that are giving me joy. So I got really healthy. I work out a lot. It’s sort of replacing the addiction with something that’s good, that’s keeping me sane. And now I have two kids, and they’re young, and that’s another healthy distraction.  Do you have any safeguards to keep you from checking on crypto?  Yeah, I have an app called Freedom. It lets you block certain sites, so I block all the crypto sites. And I try not to be on the computer as much. I’m limiting my screen time to have less exposure. I also block social media.  That sounds healthy for just about everyone! Last question. What advice do you have for others who are now in your shoes, and who think they might have some kind of crypto addiction?  I think it’s very easy to think, “Oh, this is not a real problem.” I see it with friends. I’m not saying they necessarily need to go into rehab, but checking your phone every minute to see if prices are going up; that’s not healthy. Acknowledge that you have a problem. That’s the first thing.  The second thing: Be safe with your crypto. Spend some time to take safety precautions. I know this is unrelated to addiction, but it’s a message that feels important to say.  Wise words, sir. Thanks again for sharing your story. Best of luck to you.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/04/i-totally-obsessed-over-it-how-crypto-addiction-almost-ruined-my-life,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3eb0b7722f3f18638b4d557367082c0bf65868a8-5805x3875.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421182,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd5ED,1651674010,Bored & Hungry in Crypto: Why This Burger Joint Wants to Use ApeCoin,"Before the restaurateur Andy Nguyen decided to launch Bored & Hungry – a novelty burger spot themed around the Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token (NFT) collection – he was planning on something much more tame.  Originally, Nguyen was looking to open a humble vegan restaurant. The space was rented, the arrangements made. Then, Nguyen discovered NFTs.  “Once I had this idea, I halted everything and started pivoting,” he said.  He’s glad he did; in the few weeks since Bored & Hungry had its grand opening in Long Beach, California, it’s become a sort of mecca for SoCal’s NFT enthusiasts. They come for the wild decorations – the massive Bored Ape cutouts scattered around the store, the acid green floor, the painted murals with slogans like “FUD Destroyer,” “FOMO” and “The Ape-Trix” – but also for the food, which itself reflects the theme. There are two limited menus, the “Boring Menu,” consisting of meat-based “Trill Burgers,” and a plant-based trough called “Mutant Feeding,” which takes inspiration from a Bored Ape spin-off collection called the Mutant Apes. On opening day, a line of crypto pilgrims stretched around the block.  In anchoring Bored & Hungry around a set of specific Apes (one standard Bored Ape and three Mutants), Nguyen was taking advantage of the Bored Ape Yacht Club’s special provisions regarding commercial rights. Yuga Labs, the company behind the Yacht Club, allows NFT owners to monetize their apes however they see fit, as long as they can prove they actually own the tokens. That is to say, Nguyen and his team had to shell out for those four NFTs before turning them into mascots.  Customers at Bored & Hungry can also theoretically pay in crypto, specifically ETH, the primary token associated with most NFTs, and ApeCoin (APE), the official coin of the Bored Apes.  A quick look at the restaurant’s Ethereum address suggests only a few customers have pulled this off. Since it opened on April 9, Bored & Hungry has seen just 10 transactions in ApeCoin from four different wallets. And when my colleague actually drove over to Long Beach for a burger, restaurant staff informed him the ApeCoin payments system wasn’t working.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Nguyen explains himself.  This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.  Where did the idea for Bored & Hungry come from?  I was learning about the NFT space and wanted to … shift and change the restaurant industry with it. But I didn't want to enter Web 3 without giving back somehow, I wanted to provide some value. So I had an idea to purchase a Bored Ape and open the restaurant concept with it utilizing the IP, once I realized you could have the IP rights.  It kind of fits into the world that I've been working in for the past two decades.  And it was meant to be a pop-up?  It was meant to be a pop-up, just because we didn’t know the reaction, or what was going to be. But we knew we wanted to provide value for the community. And just me being in the space before opening this, you hear everyone’s like, “Hey, how do you bring in real life experience with these entities?” And it’s like, OK, well, I have something. This is what I do, this is how I can merge it.  And for the skeptics calling it a JPEG: This is what I can do with the IP rights of this JPEG. I can create a brand and business out of it and merge these worlds together in this “real life experience” space.  What’s been the general crypto literacy level of customers so far? Is it a lot of Bored Ape fans, crypto fans in general or people just wandering past?  It’s a mix of all of it. Because when you come into the space, there’s a lot going on, from the visuals, the floor, to the walls, to the outside, the cutouts – it already feels like you’re kind of going to this brand experience. So you’re getting people like kids, who are bringing their parents there because they don’t necessarily own any NFTs, but they want to be involved in pop culture. We have a lot of Ape holders, we have a lot of other NFT holders as well, and there’s people that just saw cool packaging, they want to see what it’s all about.  Why take ApeCoin for burgers?  The day we announced the Bored & Hungry project with the restaurant space visual, that was the same day that ApeCoin was being launched. And once I looked at my phone, everyone just kept asking, “Are you going to accept ApeCoin?” Fortunately we found our buddy Nate [Flickinger] from Augminted Labs, who helped develop the software on a native website so that we could accept Bitcoin and Ethereum. It was literally down to the wire, from 12 hours before, that we finally got the system working.  Have people been using crypto to make payments?  Absolutely. We're still training ourselves and our staff on how to utilize it, but yes, people do want to pay. It’s being a part of history for them.  What does that buying process look like?  You go to the native website, and then you choose a meal – either the vegan meal or the regular beef smashburger meal – and then we help them process through their phone. It goes to their Metamask [wallet] and sends a payment through that native system that we do through our website.  That’s the “eatbandh.com” site right?  Yeah. We accept ethereum currently, and ApeCoin. And we're still working out some kinks, trying to clean it up a bit. Our goal at the time was just, let’s get it out there, it might be a little hard to do because no one's done it, but let’s just get it out now and we'll figure it out along the way.  Yeah, I was noticing the full menu isn’t on there.  We're doing something that I've never even been involved in or done before. It’s interesting to learn at the same time.  What have you done with the take? Do you cash it out, or just let it sit?  Honestly, it's been so crazy, I haven't even had a chance to look at the wallet and see what's in there.  And obviously it's still technically not legal here in the U.S., but I guess we'll do that along the way.  What do you mean?  In the U.S. you're supposed to accept cash or credit card. We're here accepting a different type of payment that's not regulated. So, we haven't crossed that threshold yet. We’ll see what happens. I think right now we're doing something so innovative, and it will probably raise some flags along the way. But we're here to break that wall down. [Ed. note: accepting crypto for physical goods is legal, at least for now]  For those that can’t parse the names, what actually are the menu items? Like, the “Bored OG Burger” and “Mutant OG Burger” – what's actually in those?  The “Boring Menu” side is the beef menu that we put together. So we have an OG burger, we have an onion burger – which is similar to the OG burger, but with a ton of fried onions on it – and fries and a drink. Very simple. And the “Mutant Feeding” we just refer to as a vegan option. Something that looks like beef, but not beef.  Do you worry that the weirdness of the mutant apes might feel unappetizing?  I don't think so, I think everyone's had a good time with it. We make the store look pretty easy on the eyes. And I think people kind of get it when they walk in there. They feel that it just feels different and cool, compared to a normal restaurant. It's very photo friendly, our staff’s pretty fun. I haven't heard any bad feedback with the mutants being in the restaurant.  Are the staff crypto people?  The management side is. The staff, it's an education process. We're still trying to onboard and educate at the same time. But we're just like them – I haven't been in the space that long, and I'm still learning along the way with them.  What’s next for Bored & Hungry?  It's going to be a permanent fixture in Long Beach. We've had tons of inquiries throughout the entire world on how to expand this concept. We're currently in discussions that we still gotta roll out. We have a lot of collaborations with a lot of other IP brands that we want to work with, in the Web 3 space. There's still a lot that we want to try out, and see what other innovative things with NFTs and Web 3 we can incorporate into our concept.  Have you interacted with Yuga Labs at all?  Yeah, we actually had a call with Yuga Labs.  What about?  They were just asking us about our experience with accepting ApeCoin. We’re the only place that so far has accepted ApeCoin, outside of their merch store.

42411807,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg6GH,1651673706,What Are EIP and ERC and How Are They Connected?,"While tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) regulate software updates behind closed doors, Ethereum takes the opposite approach. Anyone with enough technical proficiency can write, edit and submit Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for new functionality or features that they would like to implement according to the guidelines in the EIP-1, which was published in 2015.  The EIP-1 is a highly recommended resource for prospective authors or contributors because it outlines all critical aspects related to EIPs, such as the process, definitions and types of EIPs, the EIP format and template, as well as a list editors and more.  If you do have an idea, know that authors of EIPs are also responsible for building engagement and gaining critical feedback in the Ethereum community.  What is an Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC)?  Since Ethereum's inception in 2015, numerous proposals and ensuing contract standards have been approved.  As stated in EIP-1, Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) relates to a specific category of Standards Track EIP. A Standards Track EIP describes any change that affects most or all Ethereum implementations and can be broken down into different subcategories such as core, networking, interface and ERC.  ERC: While the definition has grown over time, an Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) was the original draft proposal developers wrote and later refined as an EIP for different application levels and conventions. These include token standards (ERC-20), URI schemes, library/package formats (EIP-82) or wallet formats. If the specific EIP achieves consensus in the Ethereum community, it becomes a new standard that automates the rules outlined in the document through a related smart contract.  The main difference in these subcategories of Standards Track EIP is where it's deployed. For example, ERCs are deployed at the application level. They don't need to be adopted by all participants, unlike core which is deployed at the protocol level and requires a broader consensus in the community, as all core EIPs must be widely adopted (all nodes must upgrade to remain part of the network).  Along with a Standards Track EIP, other types of Ethereum Improvement Proposals include Meta EIP and an Informational EIP.  The participation and decision process for ERCs  As a central and collaborative location that contains all of the project files and entire revision history, the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) GitHub repository was created in 2015. It was also based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process, which is modeled on the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). However, before including a document in the repository, a rigorous and specific process needs to be followed as outlined in the EIP 1.  Idea/Discussion Thread: To avoid any overlap with existing proposals or standards, it is recommended that authors vet their idea by opening a discussion thread on the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians. If the concept is original and worth pursuing, the next stage is to present and document feedback of it as an EIP proposal, which must include concise technical specifications of features and the rationale behind them.  Draft: To do this, authors can create a pull request (a method of submitting contributions to an open development project) here and invite editors, reviewers and any interested party to provide feedback. For new ERC proposals, the editor(s) will then guide the author to follow the standard process and merge the proposal to draft status if or when it adheres to the guidelines.  Review: As with the initial vetting process, authors are recommended to continue auditing their draft proposal and document any foreseeable insights for future use cases. An author can mark the draft as open to community feedback by moving it to the review stage.  Last Call: Once confident that no further changes are needed, an author can create another pull request to move the document to ""last call,"" which is the final process in the review stage. If approved, the proposal will be assigned by editor as a last call. The editor will set a final date (within a minimum of two weeks) for the community to suggest any further changes. If any significant changes are needed, the document moves back to the review stage.  Final: Following the last call period, the author may then create a pull request to move the proposal to a final status, which represents the final or implemented standard. A list of all final ERC proposals can be found on https://eips.ethereum.org/erc.  If the review period for drafts exceed six months or remain inactive, documents are labeled as ""stagnant."" An ERC, however, can be revived if an author or editor moves it back to the draft stage. Proposals can also be withdrawn by authors but can be pursued later on, when they will be considered to be new proposals.  EIPs can also be categorized as ""living,"" which is a special status for EIPs that are continually updated and not meant to reach a final state, like the EIP-1  A list of EIP statuses and their definitions can be found here: https://eips.ethereum.org  The above diagram is the standard process for all EIPs in all tracks according to the EIP 1.  EIP Editors:  EIP editors are responsible for reviewing EIPs for technical soundness, spelling/grammar and code style. The original EIP editors from 2015-2016 were Martin Becze, Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood, along with several others.  According to the EIP-1, the current EIP editors are:  Alex Beregszaszi (@axic)  Matt Garnett (@lightclient)  Micah Zoltu (@MicahZoltu)  Greg Colvin (@gcolvin)  Sam Wilson (@SamWilsn)  Emeritus EIP editors are:  Casey Detrio (@cdetrio)  Nick Johnson (@arachnid)  Vitalik Buterin (@vbuterin)  Hudson Jameson (@Souptacular)  Nick Savers (@nicksavers)  Martin Becze (@wanderer)  Along with EIP editors, community members of the Ethereum Cat Herders and Ethereum Magicians also help make decisions on which EIP gets implemented and help move EIPs to the final or withdrawn stages.  Once an ERC is ready for the repository, editors will also help to do the following:  Assign an ERC number.  Merge pull requests created by authors.  Guide ERC authors to the next stages.  Generally, proposals are created and reviewed by developers with write access to the Ethereum codebase. The editors don't pass judgment on these proposals, but rather handle housekeeping aspects like monitoring ERC changes, correcting structure, highlighting mistakes, etc.  Links to the various Ethereum GitHub repositories, EIP discussion boards and a list of all core Ethereum developer meetings can be found here: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/.  Why do EIPs matter?  EIPs (which include ERCs) are the central unit around which governance (decisions) happen and are documented on Ethereum. As part of a decentralized ecosystem, they are the way for anyone to propose, debate and adopt changes. Whether integrated as a standard or included in a broader network upgrade, EIPs also help people understand how certain tokens and aspects of Ethereum function relative to the specific smart contract. Every network upgrade also consists of a set of specific EIPs that each Ethereum client needs to implement to maintain consensus with each other.  How do ERCs make different and new things possible?  A few examples of various ERC standards and their use cases include:  ERC-20: Proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller and VButerin in November 2015, the ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comments 20) is the most popular interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens that implement an API (application programming interface) within smart contracts. Some examples of what the ERC-20 token allows people to do include:  Transfer tokens between accounts.  View the current token balance of an account.  View the total supply of a token available on the network.  Confirm third-party spending.  A standard interface that allows tokens on Ethereum to be reused by other applications, for example, from wallets to decentralized exchanges.  You can read the original proposal from Buterin and the related Reddit discussion for more detail, or dive into the mechanics in our ERC-20 token explainer.  ERC-721: Inspired by the ERC-20 token standard, the ERC-721 was proposed two years later by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans and Nastassia Sachs in January 2018. While the EIP-20 caters to fungible (replicable and interchangeable assets), it doesn't support the unique structure of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), because each asset is distinct (non-fungible). As a result, the ERC-721 was created as the standard interface for NFTs like artwork or songs. Because each ERC-721 token is unique, they are reflected on the blockchain by an ID. That ID can then be used by other people or applications to verify proof of ownership.  Several well-known NFT collections that use the ERC-721 token standard include:  CryptoKitties: originally compatible with an earlier version of the ERC-721 standard, CryptoKitties is a play-to-earn game that pioneered the ability to let users breed and collect digital cats on the Ethereum blockchain.  Ethereum Name Service (ENS): a secure and decentralized naming service that helps turn cryptographic Ethereum wallet addresses into readable names, URLs and emojis like vitalik.eth as registered by Buterin.  Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC): a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs launched in April 2021 by Yuga Labs. Alongside functioning as verifiably rare digital art, each NFT also acts as a form of membership to the exclusive club, which provides community perks and benefits.  The original issues and discussions for ERC-721 can be found on the following links:  The original ERC-721 Issue. https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721.  Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7r2ena/friday_119_live_discussion_on_erc_nonfungible/.

ERC-721 (announcement of first live discussion). https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721#issuecomment-358369377.  ETHDenver 2018. https://ethdenver.com.  Further examples of ERC contract standards include:  ERC-1155: A multi-token standard that can create both fungible and non-fungible assets.  ERC-777 : a token standard that improves on the ERC-20 by reducing friction in transactions.  Overall through concerted efforts between communities like Ethereum Cat Herders and Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, the methods to integrate or make changes to Ethereum are increasingly streamlined as the network grows. Ethereum Cat Herders also encourage authors or potential implementers to speak on their PEEPanEIP series that provides an overview of EIPs considered for a network upgrade, ERC standards and other key concepts of the Ethereum blockchain. Further reading and information about the history of EIPs and the development of governance on Ethereum (including ERCs) can also be found on Hudson Jameson's blog.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the trust has already secured $25 million.  The Avalanche Trust launch comes two weeks after Valkyrie established a “Multi-Coin Trust” that invested in a basket of base-layer tokens including AVAX. This new fund is one of the only AVAX-specific funds targeting accredited investors.  Avalanche is a proof-of-stake blockchain and competitor to Ethereum in decentralized finance, or DeFi. Its native fees token was trading near $60 Tuesday, well off all-time highs above $130 set last November, according to CoinGecko.  “By launching this trust, we are able to give qualified investors exposure to a protocol that they have been increasingly asking about as DeFi projects, NFT platforms, and many other projects have increasingly begun to build on the Avalanche blockchain,” said Valkyrie Investments Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg in a press release.  The Avalanche Trust offers daily redemptions for shares, according to its fact sheet, in contrast with Multi-Coin Trust’s monthly redemption schedule. Its minimum investment is $25,000, with a 2% management fee.

42423427,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ZMph,1651672640,First Mover Americas: Hawkish Fed Trade May Not Be Over Yet,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin holds trendline support ahead of the Fed. The central bank is expected to accelerate the pace of monetary tightening. One observer said the hawkish trade isn't over yet.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Hester Peirce, commissioner, Securities and Exchange Commission  Ulrik K. Lykke, executive director, portfolio management, ARK36  Damanick Dantes, markets reporter, CoinDesk  Market Moves  It's Fed day again.  The central bank is expected to accelerate the pace of monetary tightening with a 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) rate hike and announce quantitative tightening – a phased reduction in the size of the balance sheet that has doubled to nearly $9 trillion in two years. The 50 basis point hike would lift the Fed funds target rate range to 0.75% to 1%. A basis point equals 0.01%.  The futures market is pricing in a fed funds rate of 2.82% by the end of this year, implying a 50 basis point rate hike in May and similar outsize moves in June, July and September.  Therefore, the consensus is that peak Fed hawkishness is baked in. The central bank couldn't get more hawkish, and risk assets, including bitcoin, could rally following the event.  Since December, it's been the dominant narrative, yet the Fed has surprised markets each time, killing recovery rallies. That's evident from lower highs on bitcoin's daily chart. The cryptocurrency picked up bullish momentum after the Fed kicked off the tightening cycle with a 25 basis point rate hike on March 16 and rose from $38,850 to $48,000 in the following two weeks, partly aided by the Luna Foundation Guard's (LFG) aggressive purchases. The gains, however, were erased in April, with Fed chair Jerome Powell putting a 50 basis point hike on the table.  It may not be different this time, according to Jon Turek, author of the Cheap Convexity blog.  ""To me, the hawkish trade isn't over,"" Turek wrote in the Fed preview published Wednesday, adding that the central bank is in the early stage of the tightening cycle and won't stop being aggressive until they are at a neutral policy setting. The Fed currently sees the so-called terminal or neutral rate of 2.5%.  And while the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditure price index, recently showed the worst of price rises might be behind us, the labor market remains strong. So, the central bank is unlikely to soften its hawkish stance anytime soon.  ""I think an under-discussed reason for the elevated hikes pace, are the new pace camp, is the labor market,"" Turek noted. ""The ECI (employment cost reading) reading on Friday was a reminder to the Fed that while the peak of inflation is in, it still may be at a troubling trend rate that could be exacerbated by a very tight labor market.""  Lastly, the very fact that the Fed is going for 50 basis point moves, something that it hasn't done since 2000, perhaps indicates that the central bank is trying to play catchup, after falling behind the curve on inflation in the past 12 months. The bar for the Fed to turn dovish is very high and Powell, during his press conference, is unlikely to rule out even bigger rate hikes in coming months. According to Market Watch, the Fed funds futures see a 91% likelihood of a 75 basis point hike in June, up from 19% a month ago.  All things considered, odds appear stacked against a notable relief rally in bitcoin, more so, as the euphoria from LFG's bitcoin purchases has faded and funds saw record outflows in April.  From a technical analysis standpoint, the focus is on the trend line connecting Jan. 24 and Feb. 24 lows. A break lower would mean a continuation of the sell-off from November highs around $69,000 and expose the bigger ascending trend line, currently located at $29,400.  On the higher side, the March 28 high of $48,250 is the level to beat for the bulls. The cryptocurrency could begin the march toward that level if the Fed unexpectedly focuses on the negative impact of rates on the economy and softens expectations for a 75 basis point hike in June.

A key feature of conventional blockchains is the ability of any entity to verify the integrity of the blockchain ledger by executing the same algorithm that was used to generate it. What are quantum-safe blockchains? Quantum computers will be able to execute algorithms significantly faster than classical computers, enabling them to break most cryptographic algorithms. Attackers with a quantum computer might be able to break into any system that uses today&apos;s encryption algorithms and cannot evolve in time. The Post-Quantum Blockchain is the next step in blockchain technology, leveraging the power of post-quantum cryptography to ensure that data is stored securely and cannot be tampered with, so they can rely on the integrity and security of their data. In contrast to existing blockchains, which rely on the pre quantum RSA, post-quantum blockchain uses encryption algorithms like NewHope, NTRU, Frodo, SIDH that are more secure against current quantum computers.

About 4,200 Marathon miners were successfully installed in containers at one of Compute North’s new facilities in Texas, the company said in a statement. However, these mining rigs are now expected to come online in May, as opposed to its original schedule of April 17, as the company’s energy provider required additional consent from a third party. Currently, it does not expect this process to impact future deployments of miners, the firm said in the statement.  “While the power provider was working through this process, construction of Compute North’s facilities continued unimpaired and thousands of additional miners are currently being installed and prepared for energization,” said Marathon’s Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel in the statement. “Given the progress we have made at the start of this year breaking the mold on deploying behind the meter and the unique advantages we maintain from our asset light model, we are cautiously optimistic that we are still on pace to achieve 23.3 EH/s early next year,” he added.  This is a slight change from the previous statement regarding its plan to meet its guidance. On April 4, Marathon said it still believed it was ""on track to reach 23.3 EH/s by early next year,” citing delay due to a longer-than-expected permitting process for the required power for its operations. Marathon currently has 36,830 active miners producing about 3.9 EH/s of mining power.  In April, Marathon mined 299 bitcoins (BTC), a near 31% dip from the previous month’s production. The main reasons for the lower production were weather and maintenance issues, which caused the power generating station in Hardin, Montana, to operate below normal levels. Previously, Marathon said it was moving its mining machines away from the Hardin site to a more sustainable power station.  The company continues to hold onto its mined bitcoin and currently has about 9,673 bitcoins, which has a fair market value of about $365.5 million. This is in contrast to its peer Riot Blockchain (RIOT) that sold around $10 million worth of bitcoins in April, after selling about $9.4 million in March.  Marathon will report its first quarter earnings on Wednesday post-market. Analysts will mainly focus on how the company is going to house the more than 70,000 new mining rigs and source capital for growth.

42417148,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3lF,1651670697,Lindsey McInerney: The Metaverse and the 'DIC Punch',"When the world’s largest beer company wanted to “enter the metaverse,” they turned to a woman named Lindsey McInerney. But that might undersell her involvement. As AB InBev’s (BUD) global head of tech and innovation, McInerney is the one who had the idea and convinced execs that the metaverse would be “seismic,” and “way bigger than social media.”  McInerney is an unlikely champion of big brand marketing. And she’s an unlikely player in fintech. Growing up in Toronto, McInerney was drawn to countercultures and questions of identity. “My high school felt like a movie where you had the jocks, you had the nerds, you had the goths, you had the punks, and you had the skateboarders,” says McInerney. “I never fit into any one of those groups, but I floated between all of them. And I was fascinated by sort of observing them, studying them.”  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  This fascination would blossom in college, where she focused on countercultures – women’s studies, theories of gender and sexuality, and subcultures like skateboarding and the 1970s hippie movement. She was drawn to the intersection of identity and politics and activism. “I'd spend hours crawling through every book I could find on the Riot Girl Movement,” she says, and studied the early days of hacktivism.  Post-college, her career wended through PR and then social media analysis and then eventually to AB InBev, where she wrote a treatise on the explosive potential of Web 3. After helping Stella Artois enter the metaverse, she left AB InBev and launched a startup with the actress Mila Kunis and Lisa Sterbakov, called the Sixth Wall, that’s focused on Web 3 and entertainment.  McInerney is returning to her roots. Her passion has always been to try and understand culture, and she sees Web 3 as a force – maybe the force – that will change culture in ways we can barely understand. “Blockchain and Web 3 is going to infiltrate entertainment,” says McInerney, who’s now working on experimental, blockchain-driven shows where the audience helps create and guide the content. She predicts this will change the landscape of which movies and shows get made. “I'm a culture junkie,” she says. “What happens when you extend what typically happens in Hollywood to cities all over the world?”  And if that all sounds fuzzy and far out in the future, at the very least, at present, her team has implemented something called the ""DIC Punch.""  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Let’s start with your time at AB InBev. In your role as global head of tech and innovation, why was blockchain on your radar?  Lindsey McInerney: If you think about how you could use blockchain in manufacturing, like for the traceability of ingredients, it was all there. No question. But then we hit the [coronavirus] pandemic, and everything had been accelerated with cryptocurrencies and digital ownership.  And for the first time, I started to see very clearly what the consumer use cases for crypto were going to be, which was fascinating. And so I wrote a thesis on Web 3, the metaverse, [non-fungible tokens] and crypto for AB InBev. I started to explore the different ways where I thought we could approach it. For me, this was, no question, the biggest thing we could focus on.  How long did this report take you to write?  The early report I wrote in a couple of weeks because I was just so excited.  “A couple of weeks?!” I’m envious.  I was spending all this time reading and absorbing myself in forums, crawling through Twitter, blogs, and communicating with anonymous dudes on the internet.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Virtual Beers and Digital Orgasms: Welcome to the Age of Metaverse Commerce  I can relate.  You know, all the great stuff you do in this space. To try and really understand some of the things that were happening.  And I have never been more excited about the future of the internet, and it came together really, really quickly. Then I just continued to iterate. One of my theories was that the metaverse will replicate a parallel reality in a lot of ways. And so that meant that what brands do well in reality, they should be able to do well in Web 3 or the metaverse. And if you kind of abstract AB InBev from beer, one thing AB InBev does really well is that they're one of the world's largest sponsors of sport and entertainment.  What happens when you extend what typically happens in Hollywood to cities all over the world?  They bring people together to be entertained. And that's when we tend to enjoy having a beer together. AB InBev has an amazing catalog and portfolio of brands, but Stella Artois is the sponsor of premium sport. They sponsor Wimbledon here in the U.K. and a very famous horse race. So as I started to scan the landscape of things that I thought had amazing communities behind them, as well as parallel experiences to reality, Zed Run [the metaverse horse racing game] stood out.  We started talking about how we could put together something that would be powerful and beneficial for the Zed Run community, and also beneficial to AB InBev, that would replicate what we thought the future of premium horse racing would look like. So we launched 50 bundles of Genesis Zed horses with Stella Artois skins. Think of them like jerseys for the horses, as well as a commemorative art piece in an NFT auction. And we sold them out. It was really, really well received by the crypto community, which was genuinely the most important thing to me.  What are you focused on now?  I ended up co-founding a business with Mila Kunis and Lisa Sterbakov, as well as some others, to explore the intersection of Web 3 and entertainment. Mila and Lisa have been running Orchard Farms, a traditional production company, for years, and had become very excited about Web 3.  They had previously launched Stoner Cats, an NFT project that allowed token holders to participate in the production of a cartoon, which is really cool. And Mila and Lisa both see the future ahead of us, and completely understand that Web 3 is going to change every industry. And I’ve partnered with them on building out a company we’re calling the Sixth Wall.  Given your fluency and expertise with the metaverse, you could have gone in a million different directions. Why’d you choose this path?  When people hear about crypto, they think of cryptocurrencies and they think of fintech, and finance. That can be very off-putting for a large group of people. And a lot of folks will say things like, “This is just too hard. It's just too complex for me. It comes from gaming and finance. Like, how am I getting my head around this?""  And I have a real keen interest to make this simple. I want to distill this stuff down as simply as possible for as many people as possible. Because it's those very folks that we need at the table to build things better and build them right.  What’s the Sixth Wall creating now?  I have to preface all of this with that, right now, we are where we were years ago with the early App Store. When the only thing people could do is to, like, build egg timer apps. Very elementary things. And now we realize that you can build billion-dollar businesses as applications on the iPhone. So this is all eventually going to be so much bigger than we can conceive.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - How Brands Can Build in the Metaverse  Fair caveat! But what can you tell us about the current iteration?  Entertainment fascinated me, because I am interested in bringing more people to this space. NBA Top Shot was a great example. People can buy basketball cards and have no idea they were on the blockchain at all. Entertainment is a really common denominator. We love stories. We're storytellers as humans. It's built into who we are.  And I see entertainment as a way to bring a lot of new faces to crypto. In entertainment, there's never been more of a closer collaboration between community and creators than there is on ""Stoner Cats"" and the project I'm working on now, ""The Gimmicks."" It’s being defined in real time by the community.  It’s so much more than Choose Your Adventure. We're able to create things that we see in the Discord and react to them. And the writers are saying, ""Oh, my goodness. I've never been able to have this kind of real-time feedback.""  Can you describe what this is exactly?  The Gimmicks is the second show that we released. It's built on the Solana blockchain. It's a cartoon that is sort of like “South Park” meets “WWE.” It's a wrestling show. We're releasing episodes weekly. It's animated.  And we’re partnering with a studio called Toonstar. They're a Web 3 animation studio. Each week, the community gets three or five distinct choices about where they want things to go, and they can vote on this with their tokens. So if you've got a Gimmick, you can log in, and you can sort of pick the ending. And everybody else can follow along.  We’ve built one of what we think is the earliest on-chain engagements. We'll probably look back in five years and laugh at this, but when you vote, you get a “DIC Punch,” which is a token that we created that you can send to your friends.  Incredible. Go on.  So you can dick punch other people in the community. It's a finishing move for one of the characters. It's meant to be fun and just sort of in line with the tone of the show. You can think of it like the early Facebook poke.  It immediately reminded me of the Facebook poke.  We were like, “Hey, it’s like the Facebook poke, but harder.” [Laughs.] It’s very simple. That’s where we are with these technologies right now. They're simplistic but the idea is that community members are now able to engage with each other on-chain, and we’re exploring it. We're having fun and we're trying to figure out what all of this means.  And blockchain and Web 3 is going to infiltrate entertainment. We can't conceive all the ways right now, but we’re mapping the end-to-end creation of a piece of film and television to understand the ways Web 3 will intersect entertainment, from ideation stage all the way through to red carpet.  What are some predictions for what might happen, maybe three or five years from now, if the audience starts to own these stories in the metaverse?  I'm excited about seeing what a greater variety of people – a more distributed group of people – would create. I'm a culture junkie. What happens when you extend what typically happens in Hollywood to cities all over the world? What does that look like? And can that happen? And what kind of stories get told? Whose stories get told? I think that's really interesting and important.  So in theory, if there’s decentralized ownership of stories – and even IP and characters – instead of three white dudes in a Hollywood conference room brainstorming what should happen, you have a whole community that’s more diverse? Am I getting warm?  Yeah. You could have content created by people who reflect the world we live in. That's a very real possibility. Or if you look at certain projects, there's a very real possibility that people will be able to use IP, and create IP, and storytelling in ways that they haven't previously. And that could look a little bit different than it has historically.  Love it. Best of luck to you and Sixth Wall.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/lindsey-mcinerney-the-metaverse-and-the-dick-punch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65628177862f051054ac5dde4f791733ac9bfb6d-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423422,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ZMfh,1651669200,What Is So Smart About Smart Contract Platforms?,"Ether (ETH) is the main token of the Ethereum blockchain and is now the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Just like the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), ether can be used to send payments directly to another person without the need for an intermediary.  The long-term vision for Ethereum is to power more than just financial transactions. Software developers can build applications on Ethereum, ranging from decentralized platforms for lending money to social media networks to develop and exchange content. ETH is unique in its ability to fill the role of a capital asset, consumable/transformable asset, and as a store of value.  The innovative qualities of Ethereum have led to an explosion of new digital assets in the Smart Contract Platform (SCP) sector. This blog post takes a brief look at the Smart Contract Platform sector, its significance as a digital asset sector and how CoinDesk Indices is setting standards that define this sector.  The SCP sector  Smart contracts are computerized blockchain protocols that execute terms of a contract. Smart contracts represent computer codes ensuring that when both parties meet the terms of the contract they will execute automatically, allowing for trustless, peer-to-peer transactions. SCP assets are designed for the building of decentralized applications, layer 2 scaling systems, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and other custom protocols.  Every platform has a unique open-source user and miner incentive structure that utilizes the Byzantine Fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism. Every platform also utilizes a native token for the payment towards building on the platform, providing liquidity and allowing interoperability between the native token and the newly created tokens built on the platform.  SCP sector is part of DACS: What does that mean?  In December 2021, CoinDesk Indices launched its Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) to set the standard for defining the industries of digital assets. Every one of the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization is assigned to an industry defined by DACS. Then, at least one industry is assigned to an industry group. Finally, at least one industry group is assigned to a sector.  The SCP sector is the second-largest sector in DACS, with 88 assets representing over 35% of the digital asset market worth approximately $750 billion in market capitalization as of March 31, 2022. In addition to the SCP sector, DACS offers five other sectors: Currency, Computing, Culture & Entertainment, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and Digitization. The six sectors in DACS represent 22 industry groups and 35 industries.  Assigning industries to the SCP sector  To be assigned to an industry in the SCP sector, the digital asset must be transparent, self-executing and trustless. Smart contract platforms tend to have their own blockchains and consensus mechanisms, but it is disputable how to classify tokens with smart contract capabilities, depending on whether they are used for specific applications or not intended to build dapps (decentralized applications). There are also debates on whether smart contracts need to be decentralized and whether a permissioned blockchain can be classified as smart contract platform.  There are two single-industry groups: Multi-Chain/Parachain and Single Chain.  The Multi-Chain/Parachain industry includes smart contract platform assets that enable multiple parallel blockchains and cross-chain interoperability. The platform can be structured with a relay chain that allows slots for external parallel chains, or parachains.  The Single Chain industry includes layer 1, or base, blockchain in which all transactions are recorded on the primary distributed ledger. The Single chain allows for layer 2, or companion, scaling systems that remain tied to the primary blockchain for transactional competency.  SCP sector offers investors flexibility  At present, CoinDesk Indices offers two indices based on the SCP sector. The flagship index is the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Index (SCPX) that constitutes a diversified basket of smart contract platform assets with ETH making up 73% of its portfolio from its market cap weighting. However, many investors who already hold ETH do not look for that much exposure to it.  Therefore, the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Ex ETH Index (SCPXX), which is just like SPCX but without ETH, offers flexibility to investors to get exposure to assets in the smart contract platform to complement their existing positions in ETH. Alternatively, SCPXX can be used simply to get exposure to the smaller assets inside the SCP sector. The two, taken together, can be analyzed for insights on performance between ETH and the rest of the sector.  The digital assets in the SCP sector indices are determined by eligibility criteria for investability and liquidity that have the following requirements:  · Ranked in the top 200 of the DACS universe  · Listed on eligible exchanges for at least 30 days  · Supported by eligible custodians  · Market cap is higher than the median of the top 20 eligible assets  · Median daily trading volume over the past 30 days is higher than the median of the top 20 eligible assets  Shaping the digital asset economy  The SCP sector tends to foster a rich environment for innovation that attracts a high level of development and resources. These platforms leverage network effects, decentralized consensus mechanisms and compatibility with various programming languages that enable creative and innovative developers to build protocols for a wide range of purposes such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.  The SCP sector serves as a foundation for the digital economy as the dapps built on these platforms attract numerous users, empowering individuals to take greater ownership over their finances and transactions and creating a burgeoning economy with a wide range of opportunities. They also facilitate a positive reinforcement cycle through the network effect.  The SCPX and SCPXX indices offer investors greater transparency into the sector, offering essential intelligence needed to allow them to express their views by making decisions and executing more efficiently.

The EGLD price has broken the trend line of the black growth channel and stopped at the last critical point from which buyers can impose a struggle. This is in the $125 range. Of course, how the ELGD price has reached this range can not help but worry. The lack of resistance from buyers near the $125 mark and a zero counterattack after the closing of the weekly candle on 25 April tells us that there is no interest in investing in this price range. However, during consolidation, trading volumes near its borders can often lie. https://www.tradingview.com/x/ndgEnDpm/ However, given the danger of the entire cryptocurrency market collapse, we do not recommend investing much of the deposit in EGLD. If you plan to buy EGLD in the range of $125, the second purchase should be after fixing the price above $227. Just above this mark, buyers will prove that they control the market and are ready to continue to grow with the first target of $430.

42423431,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ZMRh,1651662899,Council of Europe Calls for Crypto Laundering Clampdown,"European states were urged to clamp down on crypto-enabled money laundering by the Council of Europe's Moneyval committee in a report published Wednesday.  Moneyval, which monitors smaller European states’ compliance with dirty-money norms, warned of the challenges posed by decentralized finance, privacy coins and what it said was market manipulation of major crypto assets.  “It is well known that money launderers have been abusing cryptocurrencies from their inception a decade ago,” Moneyval Chair Elżbieta Frankow-Jaśkiewicz said in a foreword to the report. “Methods are becoming ever more sophisticated, and larger in scale,” extending from drug trafficking into areas such as fraud, corruption and tax evasion.  The expert committee joined standard-setters like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in calling for a tougher approach to virtual assets. Jurisdictions, such as the European Union, are already in the course of implementing controversial FATF rules to identify crypto users and enable funds to be traced, which some in the industry have warned could harm privacy and innovation.  The rapidly evolving technology, which often spreads across multiple jurisdictions, poses a challenge for regulators, the report said, calling for enhanced regulation and supervision and better coordination among national agencies. A study due later this year will examine cryptocurrency laundering trends, it said.  “There is suspicion that some of the smaller cryptocurrencies are being set up specifically with the motive of laundering,” Frankow-Jaśkiewicz said. In addition, “the larger virtual assets are seeing heavy market manipulation, which is a major predicate offense for money laundering.”  Moneyval supervises the typically smaller European territories that are not overseen by Paris-based FATF, including fintech hubs such as Malta, Gibraltar and Estonia.  Though a monitoring body, its peer reviews of and recommendations to individual jurisdictions can influence national legislative reforms.

APE, used to vote on community decisions and other services within the popular BAYC ecosystem, rose to as high as $17.60 from this morning’s $14.40 level, data shows after the change.  The token slumped back to $15.90 after a tweet at 11:13 UTC, in which Musk said ""seems kinda fungible"" while making no reference to the new display picture.  No direct correlation between the events was established at the time of writing.  The collage was created by auction house Sotheby's for its auction last year of 101 Bored Apes. Sotheby's vice president for digital art Michael Bouhanna confirmed this in a tweet earlier today.  Musk is a proponent of dogecoin (DOGE) and has previously lent support to the memecoin’s development and adoption. He had previously stated that profile pictures on Twitter showcasing one’s non-fungible tokens (NFT) were “annoying.”  Musk, who recently agreed to buy the entirety of Twitter, said in a tweet on Tuesday that usage of the social media site for commercial and government users could attract a cost.  Several celebrities have put up, or had put up, Bored Ape pictures as their Twitter profile pictures, which has contributed to the wide popularity of the NFT collection.

42423428,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ZMnh,1651661383,Bitcoin's 'Mayer Multiple' Nears Point of Undervaluation Ahead of Fed,"Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be in the final stage of a bear market characterized by undervaluation and submission, a popular technical analysis indicator suggests. The indication comes as the market braces for rapid liquidity tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Bitcoin's ""Mayer Multiple,"" the ratio of the cryptocurrency's price to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), is just shy of 0.80. In other words, the cryptocurrency is trading at a nearly 20% discount to its 200-day SMA. Such a price structure has been relatively rare in bitcoin's 11-year history, making the 0.80 reading on the Mayer Multiple a point of undervaluation.  ""We have mapped out a Mayer Multiple of 0.8 (green trace) as a historical 'undervaluation' level. The basis for this is that less than ~15% of bitcoins trading life has been at, or below this level, providing a more probabilistic view,"" Glassnode analyst James Check wrote in a weekly analytics newsletter published on Monday.  In the past, the indicator has printed a double bottom under 0.80 during bear cycles, with the second dip under the critical level marking capitulation of longs and an eventual price bottom.  The indicator's impending dip under 0.80 could be the second of the 2021-2022 cycle. Capitulation refers to the point in a market downturn when investors give up on recapturing lost gains and sell rather than hold a given asset.  ""Bear market floors of past cycles are typically hammered out in two phases relative to the 0.8xMM level, first in the early stage of the bear (#1), and then again following a major capitulation event (#2). The market is currently hovering just above this key level in what could be argued to be a part of the 2021-22 cycle Phase #2,"" Check noted.  While the Mayer Multiple is approaching the point of undervaluation, it doesn't necessarily imply a quick bullish shift in the momentum, thanks to expectations of a hawkish Fed.  The Fed is expected to hike the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points (bp) later on Wednesday, having kicked off the tightening cycle with a 25 basis point hike last month. The central bank is also likely to announce quantitative tightening, shrugging off the negative first quarter gross domestic product print. Quantitative tightening refers to process of reducing the balance sheet size that has more than doubled to nearly $9 trillion in two years.  ""It would be an incredible surprise if the Fed didn't lift rates by 50bp at this meeting – this is well priced, with the swaps market pricing 51bp of hikes – where we do see an issue is pricing around the June FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, with a 25% chance of 75bp hike –this seems a tad lofty, but it has come down from 50% last week,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, wrote in the Daily Fix newsletter.  Weston added that under the current pricing, the market expects the Fed to take the fed funds rate above the neutral rate of 2.4% and into the restrictive territory by September. That would require a 50 basis point hike later Wednesday and similar moves in June, July and September.  ""Within a backdrop of deteriorating economic conditions, a hawkish Fed poses a significant threat to crypto markets in the short-term. And until markets have clarity on the macro backdrop, capital allocations towards risk assets will be limited,"" said CoinDesk's sister concern Genesis Global in a newsletter dated May 3.  That said, the cryptocurrency could see a minor relief rally if the Fed matches the widely expected, and priced in, 50 basis point hike.  ""We think that the market is fully expecting a 50-bp rate hike and announcement of QT at $95 [billion] per month. If the FOMC decision is in line with expectations, we may see a relief rally,"" Dick Lo, founder and CEO of TDX Strategies, said in a Telegram chat.  ""We've seen client interest in buying short-dated upside calls and call spreads as a cheap way to profit from a potential relief rally,"" Lo added.

42420813,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcN3,1651660200,The Yuga Labs Catastrophe Could Have Been Prevented,"Possibly the largest non-fungible token (NFT) sale in Ethereum history, the Otherside “virtual land sale” pushed Ethereum fees high enough to render the entire network virtually unusable for several hours on Saturday.  In case you missed it – the highly anticipated NFT launch netted over $400 million in sales for Yuga Labs, the startup behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. It also generated an unprecedented $100 million in Ethereum gas fees in just under an hour.  In at least one sense, the recent spike in Ethereum gas prices is kind of like the surge in prices for the other kind of gas – the one that fuels your car.  In both cases, there’s a blame game going on. With real-world inflation of fuel and other living costs, depending on whom you ask, the culprit is either money printing or COVID stimulus or corporate greed or, most recently, Vladimir Putin.  With the on-chain “gas wars,” the question last weekend became how much of the problem was attributable to Ethereum’s limitations versus poor planning (or deliberate scheming) from Yuga Labs, whose sale of digital “land” was the proximate cause of the run-up in fees.  Gas wars on Ethereum  Gas fees – which users are required to pay whenever they transact on Ethereum – increase in response to higher network activity. While some gas is “burned” by the network, users can also set a “tip” to go to the so-called miners who process transactions.  A higher tip can be used to expedite a transaction – bumping that transaction to the front of the line so it can be processed more quickly. Too low of a tip can lead to transactions that stall or fail entirely, as happened frequently throughout Saturday night.  Enough people wanted in on Otherside this past weekend that gas fees across Ethereum shot up to historic highs. Twitter was quickly flooded with reports of users spending thousands of dollars’ worth of gas on individual transactions.  Some users claimed to have paid the high fees by accident, whereas others paid the gas knowingly, only to learn later on that their transactions had failed.  Yuga quickly promised to refund gas fees for Otherside minters with failed transactions, but the exorbitant fees and failures afflicted Ethereum users networkwide.  The Yuga Labs debacle: What happened  In a tweeted apology, Yuga said on Saturday that Ethereum’s low network capacity posed a “bottleneck” for the project. According to Yuga, the debacle made it “abundantly clear” that it would need its own chain in order to “properly scale” moving forward.  But not everyone viewed Sunday’s sale as just an indictment of Ethereum. Critics of Yuga said its engineers could have easily programmed Otherside’s smart contracts to expend less gas.  Will Papper, co-founder of SyndicateDAO, explained in a popular Twitter thread that “[m]odifying a few words would have saved $80M+.”  On top of failing to optimize smart contracts, Yuga didn’t appear to adopt enough safeguards to prevent the demand for Otherside from clogging up the network.  On one hand, Yuga seemed cognizant of the fact that the Otherside mint was going to attract sizable traffic. In part to prevent a gas war (like the one that ultimately ensued), Yuga restricted minting abilities to users who identified themselves via a formal verification process. Yuga also created a limit of two “Otherdeed” NFTs per each preapproved wallet.  These gating tactics might’ve eased network traffic somewhat, but Yuga also played a hand in increasing congestion by, at the last minute, forgoing its typical Dutch auction format. In a Dutch auction, Yuga’s Otherdeed NFTs would have started at one price and then dropped lower over time until the supply ran out.  While ditching the Dutch auction was framed by Yuga as a way to make things more equitable, it also turned the mint event into a mad dash where everyone was trying to mint at the same time.  In light of Yuga’s poor planning and shoddy engineering, Yuga’s sudden suggestion that it might pivot to its own blockchain made some onlookers suspicious. Crypto Twitter quickly grew rife with speculation (without evidence) that Yuga intentionally clogged up the Ethereum network in order to justify a move away from the network.  Yuga wouldn’t be the first major NFT company to spin out of Ethereum onto its own blockchain.  This weekend’s events were particularly reminiscent of a similar incident in 2017 which saw CryptoKitties – the first NFT project to gain significant traction on Ethereum – grind the Ethereum network to a halt as a result of high demand.  The creator of CryptoKitties, Dapper Labs, has since launched the Flow blockchain in order to scale its NFT gaming empire.  The most notable NFT company to leave Ethereum for its own chain is Sky Mavis, which launched the Ronin network in order to handle the transaction volume of its play-to-earn gaming juggernaut Axie Infinity.  In order to scale, Ronin appears to have made sacrifices to security and decentralization that enabled hackers to siphon over $600 million away from the network in March.  Given the (much maligned) centralization of Flow and Ronin relative to Ethereum, Yuga’s most vocal critics feel the company might’ve felt the need to front-run criticism that would come if it launched its blockchain.  Saving face  While Yuga’s screwups were immense, it’s hard to believe they were premeditated.  A less cynical interpretation – the one Papper subscribes to – is that Yuga simply put the blame on Ethereum as a way to save face.  “I don't believe that Yuga would leave $100 million to $150 million on the table for a marketing stunt. … The rumors circulating that this was intentional and done to promote a new chain are incorrect,” Papper said.  While it is probably fair to criticize Yuga for its apparently poor engineering practices, Papper notes “gas optimization standards are still emerging.” It is possible (albeit embarrassing) that Yuga’s engineers merely screwed up.  Yuga also did seem to anticipate demand for the mint by requiring verification and originally planning a Dutch auction, and it’s possible they really did believe changing to a fixed-price model would’ve increased equity without spurring a gas war.  Finally, there’s not even any guarantee that Yuga (or its DAO) will build out its own chain when all is said and done. Ultimately, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Yuga move over to an Ethereum developer-friendly blockchain that already exists like Polygon or Avalanche. (Given how the Otherside smart contracts were engineered, it’s hard to imagine people would trust a Yuga-made chain anyway.)  Ethereum scaling  It’s been a while since Ethereum faced a slowdown of this magnitude, and Yuga certainly made mistakes in the lead up to the Otherside launch. Still, it’s hard not to view this past weekend’s debacle as yet another example in a long list showing that Ethereum desperately needs to increase its transaction capacity.  Read more: Ethereum’s Rollups Aren’t All Built the Same  The much-anticipated Merge, which will soon turn Ethereum into a proof-of-stake network, will not, at least in the short term, have much of an impact on the network’s throughput. The shift to proof-of-stake will improve the environmental impact of Ethereum, but it isn’t expected to have much of an effect on gas fees or network speeds.  Sharding, an Ethereum upgrade that could theoretically improve upon these aspects, was delayed in favor of expediting the switch to proof-of-stake. For now, it doesn’t look as if sharding will be coming anytime soon.  The main way the Ethereum community is currently working to scale is through layer 2 rollups, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, which process transactions on separate blockchains before bundling them up and passing them back down to Ethereum.  Though rollups have experienced growth over the past year, they’ve yet to reduce prices to the level of chains like Solana and Polygon (which is building out its own rollup). Unless layer 2 solutions manage to expand their developer communities and userbases, Ethereum will continue to see more teams like Yuga running for greener pastures.

While the crypto market is now bearish, another crash is improbable, at least until the FOMC meeting concludes.

42421613,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiKL,1651628621,Who’s Surprised by the SEC’s ‘Power Grab?’,"Something like $200 million in various cryptos were stolen, exploited or just plain burned over the past eight days. Given that, is it any wonder that regulators like Gary Gensler want closer oversight of the crypto sector?  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Consumer protections  The narrative  Crypto investors lost nearly $300 million to hacks and stratospheric gas fees caused by a project minting a “digital land sale” over the past week. No friggin’ wonder regulators are worried about consumer protections.  Why it matters  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seems to be approaching crypto with an “enforcement-first” view. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said he’s concerned with investor protection, and it’s not hard to see why he may feel justified in giving the agency greater oversight over the sector. The crypto industry may want to look into best practices and a formal system targeted at protecting its users if people want to head off the regulatory agency.  Breaking it down  Here’s a look at some prominent headlines over the past seven days:  One of the common refrains we’ve heard from Gensler, as well as his predecessor Jay Clayton, is that the SEC is interested in protecting consumers from risky situations. The industry has expressed its opposition to recent moves by the SEC to (possibly) establish oversight of the digital currency sector, particularly decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and projects.  Here’s the thing, though: It’s hard to argue Gensler doesn’t have a point. Crypto users lost millions over the past seven days for various reasons, and they don’t have much recourse beyond hoping the platforms can either recover their lost funds or will otherwise make them whole.  It’s worth asking whether the SEC would be as forward about regulating crypto if these concerns were mitigated through other means. I’ve reported on Gensler for the past year and change, and several individuals I’ve spoken to say he’s sincere when he says he’s solely interested in protecting consumers (as opposed to him just conducting a “power grab” over the cryptocurrency industry for its own sake).  In fairness, the $100 million to $200 million lost in the last week may not seem like that much when compared with crypto’s current $1.8 trillion market cap. But that’s still someone’s money that is now irrevocably gone.  Here’s the playbook: A project launches. Sometimes the code is audited. Sometimes it isn’t. On occasion the project is exploited. A rogue programmer finds an accessible endpoint in the wild or a savvy huckster somehow acquires admin access keys or users are fooled into sending millions of dollars' worth of crypto to a shady address.  At any rate, you now have users who are out some money. For those who have funds in excess (*cough* they’re rich enough that the loss of a few thousand or even million dollars is no big deal), this may be at most an inconvenience. For everyone else, though, this could be catastrophic, and certainly harmful.  There's no consistency in how companies respond right now, either. Some companies offer refunds or find ways of making users whole. If we dig through the archives, exchanges like Bitfinex created their own tokens that they distributed to users. The tokens from Bitfinex were redeemable for equity (or $1 apiece). Others raise funds to distribute to users.  Other companies take completely different routes. Yuga Labs, the force behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club, for example, offered an apology for clogging up the Ethereum blockchain and contributing to high gas prices, and suggested it would simply build its own layer 1 blockchain to support future BAYC-related efforts (some believe the tweet and the network congestion that prompted it were deliberate).  That brings its own risks, as Sky Mavis recently demonstrated with its Ronin hack, in which the company lost over $600 million to North Korean hackers.  The question seems to me to be, “Is anyone actually protecting users?”  Right now, the answer seems to be “people on Twitter,” a good intuition and the rare actual audit. But again, there's no consistency here.  Bringing this back to Gensler and the SEC, the industry’s taken issue with proposals that seem like they would bring decentralized exchanges and other similar projects under the regulator’s purview.  Lots of projects don’t suffer multimillion-dollar exploits. But the projects that do tend to get the headlines. And I’m sure that concern is front and center on Gensler’s plate.  There's also a growing movement among some lawmakers and industry participants to have the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) act as the primary regulator for crypto, but it doesn’t have a consumer protection mandate in the same way the SEC does (the SEC’s mandate is focused on disclosures). Further, waiting for Congress to take some action here will probably take a while.  The SEC is now nearly doubling the size of its crypto enforcement team, opening 20 new roles. There's been some backlash from the crypto world given that these are specifically enforcement roles, rather than roles for individuals who could write guidance letters.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  No new nominees over the past week.  Elsewhere:  US Lawmakers Reintroduce Bill to Give CFTC Crypto Spot Market Oversight: Reps. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and Darren Soto (D-Fla.) have reintroduced the Digital Commodity Exchange Act, which would give the CFTC greater oversight of spot crypto markets that list digital commodities (so bitcoin, ether, things like that) while leaving security token exchanges under the SEC’s purview. Money services businesses would also remain under state regulatory purviews.  Ohio's Senate Candidates Stake Out Crypto Positions: Crypto isn't a huge voting issue in Ohio's Senate primary race this year, but several leading candidates have staked out positions on it anyway.  What a Mining Moratorium Could Really Mean for New York’s Crypto Industry: The New York state Senate is considering a bill that would impose a two-year moratorium on new proof-of-work crypto mining operations powered by nonrenewable sources. Here's what that could mean for the state's industry.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Politico) The Supreme Court of the United States is poised to strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that enshrined the right to an abortion into federal law, according to a leaked draft ruling obtained by Politico. The ruling as currently framed would appear to have implications for other rights currently thought to be protected, including a right to contraceptives, same-sex marriage and even privacy.  (Vice) Facebook has a ton of user data. And the company can’t really keep track of who else can access that information or how it gets there.  (The Verge) The Verge’s Elizabeth Lopatto recaps Bitcoin 2022 in Miami last month, where she observed something interesting: There seems to be more interest in “crypto” than in “bitcoin” right now.

Over the last three months, the coin had continued to hold its prices above the $14.40 price mark. At press time today, DOT was trading extremely close to that level. This comes after Polkadot had registered a price hike to $19 during the third week of last month. The bulls had tried very hard to defend the prices at the $16 price support level. DOT went on a slide and it hasn&apos;t halted since. Prices of the asset tried to trade above the aforementioned support line and tried to push the price north but it seems like aiming for $24 could be far fetched for the coin at the moment. As prices have considerably fallen in the past week, buyers&apos; interest in the coin has also been waning off and that has added to the bearish thesis of the coin.

The coin had managed to keep prices above the $14 support level for the past three months but at the moment, DOT was about to break through the support line. This has also suggested a fall in buying strength and that has caused prices to travel southwards.
