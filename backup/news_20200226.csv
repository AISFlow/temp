42404077,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIg9,1582756424,"Ripple Class-Action Lawsuit Can Proceed, Judge Rules","A lawsuit claiming Ripple violated securities laws will be allowed to move forward – though with a caveat favorable to the San Francisco-based payments firm.      In a ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton, of the Northern District of California, allowed a putative class-action lawsuit by retail XRP (XRP) buyers to proceed. Hamilton said the suit can include claims filed under federal law but dismissed some claims filed under California state law. Plaintiffs can refile some of the claims under California law in an amended complaint within 28 days, she added.      The order follows a hearing held in mid-January between the plaintiff, which includes Bradley Sostack, a one-time XRP owner, and the defendant, which includes Ripple, its XRP II subsidiary and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.      Notably, the judge appears to have found Ripple’s argument that the plaintiffs filed their complaint after a legal deadline (the “statute of repose”) persuasive. However, Hamilton said it does not prevent the lawsuit itself from proceeding, pointing to the claims under federal law.      “Based on plaintiff’s complaint and the judicially noticeable facts proffered, the court cannot conclude that defendants’ first bona fide public offer to sell XRP occurred before August 5, 2016,” she said.      The amended complaint at the heart of Wednesday’s ruling was filed in August 2019.      “While defendants did acknowledge various 2013 offers and sales in their May 2015 settlement with the USAO [U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California], the sales activity identified in that settlement does not show that defendants targeted the general public when offering to sell XRP,” the judge wrote.

42404087,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIo1,1582752957,Bitcoin Drove Half of Square's Cash App Revenue in the 4th Quarter,"Very close to half the revenue on Square's Cash App in the fourth quarter came from bitcoin.      Jack Dorsey's payments company reported on bitcoin (BTC) profits as part of its fourth-quarter 2019 revenue results, in a shareholder letter released Wednesday. It reported bitcoin revenue of $178 million between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, with gross profits of $3 million, up 50 percent over the prior two quarters.      Non-bitcoin revenue on Cash App in the fourth quarter was $183 million.      The company reported a year-end profit of $8 million on $516 million in yearly bitcoin revenue.      On Wednesday's investor call, Dorsey said a Cash App redesign made it easier for new users to discover other services.      ""The peer-to-peer transfers network continues to be our best acquisition channel,"" Dorsey said. ""Those new to the app then go on to discover bitcoin"" and other in-app products, he said.      Later in the call, Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja said once a Cash user starts using the app's bitcoin or Investing features, they tend to generate two-to-three times the revenue of regular users.      ""We are able to efficiently acquire customers, keep them engaged and show them additional ways we can continue to add value,"" Ahuja said.      Square rolled out bitcoin services on its Cash App across the U.S. in the summer of 2018. It serves as the buyer and seller of bitcoin for its customers. In June 2019, it started allowing customers to deposit bitcoin into the app.      During the third quarter of 2018, Square yielded only $43 million in bitcoin revenue through its Cash App, making today's results indicate very strong growth in interest in the original cryptocurrency among the app's users.      Ultimately, Square spent $174.4 million bitcoin services in the fourth quarter, for a total of $508 million for 2019. That's compared to $164.8 million for 2018.      The Cash App as a whole drove $361 million in revenue in Q4. Square's total revenue for Q4 2019 was $1.31 billion. Square's profits for the year were $1.9 billion.      The company is projecting up to $715 million in transaction and bitcoin costs for Q1 2020.    Grand plans    Much of the bitcoin community has been watching to see what other contributions Square will make to the ecosystem. In January, the Square Crypto team announced it would focus on building out a software development kit to make it easier for applications to integrate bitcoin's lightning network.      Given Dorsey's involvement with Twitter, the crypto community has long anticipated some kind of integration between the site and bitcoin. So far, neither Dorsey nor Square has done anything to substantiate such hopes.      Still, analysts view the growth in Square's bitcoin business as positive. Square stock was up 6 percent after the earnings report was released.      ""If Square succeeds in growing its bitcoin business across the globe, especially in areas where fiat currency is not easily and readily accepted by merchants, and in hyperinflationary countries, the company will have a major advantage over its payment processing competitors,"" Gartner analyst Avivah Litan told CoinDesk. ""It will be able to grow its payment business among some of the fastest-growing and most promising economies of the world, located mainly in Africa.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/26/bitcoin-drove-half-of-squares-cash-app-revenue-in-the-4th-quarter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02c59ddc48eb6d96fc54e957be327fcae25d745e-2560x1708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404084,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhIm3,1582751675,Tokenized US T-Bond Fund Seeks Foothold in $17T Market,"The crypto industry is taking aim at one of Wall Street’s oldest redoubts: investing in the $17 trillion market for U.S. Treasury bonds.      Arca Funds, a Los Angeles-based money manager specializing in cryptocurrencies, wants to create a fund to buy U.S. Treasury bonds and then use them to back a digital token created atop the ethereum blockchain network. Those tokens will then be distributed to investors.      The plan, refiled earlier this month after more than a year of back-and-forth with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, still awaits the regulator’s approval. Executives with the project say they’re hopeful for the go-ahead in the next few months, and they have touted the effort on Arca’s website while hiring a new public-relations firm to help with publicity.      The proposed “ArCoin” would provide a modern alternative to the current methods of investing in Treasurys, namely buying bonds from a broker or acquiring shares in a fund that holds them. Morningstar, which tracks the money management industry, lists more than $330 billion of funds devoted to investing in government bonds, dominated by U.S. Treasurys.      A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) spokesman declined to comment on the status of the filing, but Arca says its new project would be the first tokenized fund to be fully authorized under the Investment Company Act of 1940, making it easily available to most U.S. traders in the fast-growing digital-asset markets.      According to Arca executives, the ease of transferring cryptocurrencies over blockchain networks means an investor could even pay for goods or services using the Treasury-fund tokens.      “It’s collapsing the space between payments and investment vehicles,” Arca CEO Rayne Steinberg said in a phone interview.      Cryptocurrency markets have been criticized by some lawmakers, regulators and mainstream investors over their reputation as a hunting ground for fraudsters and scammers, not to mention a popular payments channel for criminals, money launderers and foreign actors looking to skirt financial sanctions.      But entrepreneurs say innovations in blockchain technology create the potential for faster transactions than on Wall Street’s current market systems, with lower costs and fewer middlemen.      Facebook’s proposal last year to launch a payments token known as Libra prompted a rush by central bankers globally to study digital currencies — potentially a sign of how vulnerable traditional financial firms and monetary systems are to fresh competition from emerging technologies.    The rise of the 'blockchain-traded fund'?    The ultimate prize for crypto-focused entrants like Arca is that a new market for digital token-based funds might spring up to compete with exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which can be traded like shares on venues such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Invented less than three decades ago, ETFs have grown to become a $4 trillion asset category, enriching big purveyors including BlackRock and State Street.      Steinberg, 42, is the son of the New York socialite Gayfryd Steinberg and adopted son of the late corporate raider and financier Saul Steinberg. During the 2000s, the younger Steinberg worked for the ETF-focused investment firm WisdomTree, led by his stepbrother Jonathan Steinberg. WisdomTree announced in January it wants to start offering clients digital assets, including a so-called stablecoin linked to the U.S. dollar.      In materials on closely held Arca’s website, executives describe the proposed ArCoin as a “blockchain-traded fund,” or BTF.      Rayne Steinberg says Arca plans to target big institutional investors as the first potential customers for its tokenized Treasury fund, if approved. The SEC’s blessing would help to build trust in the product, and investors might warm to the income that would come from a Treasury fund, even with interest rates at historically low levels.      Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman, a former bond trader at Merrill Lynch and Citadel and who is also a CoinDesk contributor, will manage the proposed fund, according to the filing.      “When you talk about why there's not more institutional adoption in crypto, it's because there aren't institutional-grade products as they would think of them,” Steinberg said.      The SEC has thus far refused to approve a bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to bet on the cryptocurrency with the ease of buying a stock using a brokerage account. The regulator has cited concerns that the price of the underlying 11-year-old cryptocurrency is prone to manipulation.      The ArCoin’s underlying investments, however, are Treasury bonds — considered among the world’s safest and most reliable assets. The U.S. government’s triple-A ratings from Moody’s and Fitch make the securities heavily sought after by foreign central banks as reserves, and by investors as a safe haven from volatile stock and corporate-bond markets in times of geopolitical or economic turmoil. But it’s the blockchain-based issuance and distribution technology that’s new and, as yet, untested for a regulated investment fund.    A 'new and untested' market    According to a Feb. 7 filing with the SEC, the project would consist of issuing digital securities whose ownership and transfer would be authenticated on the ethereum blockchain under a compatibility standard known as ERC-1404. According to Arca’s website, the coins could be redeemed for cash on a quarterly basis.      “The ERC-1404 standard allows shareholders to interoperate with the entire ethereum ecosystem with added functionality that allows the fund to enforce transfer restrictions within the ArCoin smart contract,” the filing reads. A smart contract is a computer programming script that stipulates how the tokens work and gets embedded into the blockchain network.      One risk for investors, according to the filing, is that digital-asset markets might lack the deep liquidity U.S. Treasury investors currently enjoy in traditional markets.      “Use of the blockchain in this fashion is relatively new and is untested,” the filing reads. “Investors should therefore initially expect greater price volatility in the secondary market than would be the case if the shares had greater liquidity.”      There’s also the potential for congestion on the ethereum blockchain and “the possibility of breakdowns and trading halts as a result of undiscovered technology flaws,” according to the filing.      Arca plans to use Fifth Third Bank, a big regional bank based in Ohio, as its custodian and DTAC LLC as its transfer agent. DTAC was registered as a new subsidiary in December by the San Francisco-based crypto-focused startup TokenSoft. Mason Borda, TokenSoft’s CEO, told CoinDesk in an interview that month his firm was creating “an automated investment bank,” allowing issuers to bypass Wall Street underwriters.      The Arca project looks like a “plain-vanilla fund that uses blockchain technology,” says Jay Baris, a New York-based partner in the investment practice at the white-shoe law firm of Shearman & Sterling, which caters to big U.S. banks such as Citigroup.      “It's inevitable that this is going to happen, and if it works it could take off,” according to Baris, who isn’t involved in the Arca project. “It’s just that nobody's done it yet.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/26/tokenized-us-t-bond-fund-seeks-foothold-in-17t-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70397172bd53a8f51214185f9c1819e1f023abe9-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a filing posted Wednesday, the securities regulator wrotethe New York-based Wilshire Phoenix had not proven the bitcoin (BTC) market is sufficiently resistant to market manipulation. Wilshire, a newcomer to the financial services industry, first applied for the ETF last summer with NYSE Arca.      ""The Commission concludes that NYSE Arca has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), and, in particular, the requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange be 'designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices' and 'to protect investors and the public interest,'"" the filing said.      SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as ""crypto mom"" in the space, published a dissent, writing that the agency applies a ""heightened standard"" to bitcoin products. As an example, she said the SEC had not required surveillance-sharing agreements with markets of significant size, an argument the agency outlined in its rejection of Bitwise's bitcoin ETF application.      ""This line of disapprovals leads me to conclude that this Commission is unwilling to approve the listing of any product that would provide access to the market for bitcoin and that no filing will meet the ever-shifting standards that this Commission insists on applying to bitcoin-related products—and only to bitcoin-related products,"" she wrote.      The SEC has rejected all previous bitcoin ETF proposals filed to date. Wilshire hoped to buck the trend by basing its ETF proposal on U.S. Treasury bonds in addition to bitcoin. William Herrmann, Wilshire's managing director, previously told CoinDesk the fund would automatically rebalance itself in response to bitcoin's price volatility. Should the cryptocurrency's price fluctuate too much, the fund would invest more heavily into bonds, and reverse that position as the price stabilizes.      This automatic rebalancing came as a response to the SEC's previous rejections. The agency rejected a number of bitcoin ETF applications out of concerns the bitcoin market is not significant in size and potentially easy to manipulate.      Last year, the agency published a rejection order for Bitwise Asset Management's bitcoin ETF proposal on these grounds.

In this episode, @nlw revisits that narrative and argues it is uncomfortably bunched up with the uncorrelated asset narrative, or, as Chamath Palihapitiya calls it, “schmuck insurance.”      This episode also covers:    Central bank digital currency (CBDC) news: Canada says it doesn’t see the need right now but that could change if private cryptos get more traction, while China’s work on a digital yuan is paused due to coronavirus shutdowns.

According to TechCrunch, Tagomi is set to formally announce its intention to join the association later this week. It joins ecommerce platform Shopify, which announced it would join the group last week, joining a host of other crypto platforms, tech startups, non-profits and venture funds.      The additions come after a series of high-profile departures from the organization, most recently last month when Vodafone announced it was pulling out of the stablecoin project to focus on its own digital payments platform, M-Pesa.      Prior to its formation, a number of payments firms, including Mastercard, Visa and Stripe, publicly announced their withdrawals from the group. Unlike Vodafone, these companies' withdrawals were thought to be due to regulatory concerns.      Tagomi President Marc Bhargava confirmed the news to CoinDesk. A spokesperson for the Libra Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      Libra has been under sustained regulatory fire since its announcement by Facebook in June 2019. Regulators worldwide called for a moratorium on development and urged the social media giant to work with regulatory authorities at the time.      This furor does not appear to have calmed in the months since June. Earlier this month, European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said the Libra project ""lacks detail,"" according to a memo. However, Dombrovskis said the EU still intends to ensure Libra is compliant with the relevant laws and regulations once it launches.      In a statement shared with CoinDesk Thursday, Libra head of policy and communications Dante Disparte said, ""We are excited to welcome Tagomi to the Libra Association. Tagomi joins a growing group of Libra Association members committed to achieving a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of a global payment system that breaks down financial barriers for billions of people.""

42383386,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vJeF,1582745153,The 3 Factors Fueling Ether’s 2020 Rally,"Ether (ETH) has had a great 2020 so far. Though down nearly 20 percent from recent highs, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value is still up a solid 80 percent on a year-to-date basis.       Ether bottomed out near $115 on Dec. 18 and rose sharply to a high of $289 on Feb. 15. That was the highest level since July 2019, according to CoinDesk’s Ether Price Index.       To be sure, prices have pulled back in the last few days along with bitcoin (BTC), which has declined below the $9,000 from a recent high around $10,500. Nonetheless, ether’s gains look more impressive when compared to bitcoin’s 21 percent year-to-date rally.       Several factors could explain ether’s spectacular gains and determine whether they will continue.       According to market observers and participants, ether has been driven higher mainly by the upcoming bitcoin reward halving and the resulting rise in bitcoin, the anticipated release of ETH 2.0 and the breakout of the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry.     Bitcoin rally      Bitcoin bottomed out near $6,430 in mid-December and reached a multi-month high of $10,500 on Feb. 14. Currently, it is trading at $9,250, representing nearly 30 percent gains on a year-to-date basis.       The cryptocurrency has put on a good show, mainly due to the bullish narrative surrounding the upcoming reward halving – a programmed cut of 50 percent in rewards block per mined – that has been the driving force for bitcoin’s year-to-date gains and the entire crypto market rally, Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk.       Historically, reward halvings marked the beginning of bull markets. The popular narrative is that the reduction in rewards created supply deficits and boosted prices. The analyst community extensively discussed the positive impact of halving on price throughout 2019. As a result, bullish expectations may have made their way into the marketplace, with investors buying the cryptocurrency after the downside momentum ebbed in mid-December, possibly on the hope the price would go up ahead of the upcoming halving — in other words, a self-fulfilling prophecy.       Whatever the reason, bitcoin may have helped ether and other cryptocurrencies stage a solid rally.       The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin rose from $52.86 billion to $117 billion in the six weeks to Feb. 15, according to data source TradingView.     ETH 2.0    This is in stark contrast to the second half of 2019, when ether took a beating, falling from $360 to $116. One of the big reasons for the price drop, other than the bitcoin sell-off during that period, was the decline in investor confidence due to ethereum’s persistent scalability issues.       Back then, ethereum had consistently missed deadlines for protocol upgrades to ETH 2.0 – a major network upgrade that will shift the blockchain’s current proof-of-work consensus algorithm to proof-of-stake and transfer validation function from miners to special network validators.       However, clarity emerged on that front after developers informed markets on Feb. 5 they are planning to launch the upgrade on the networks’ fifth anniversary, July 30, 2020. “I have 95 percent confidence we will launch in 2020,” Ethereum 2.0 researcher Justin Drake wrote during an Ask Me Anything Reddit Discussion on Feb. 5.       The assurance from developers likely helped ether, said Abendschein. The cryptocurrency jumped by 8 percent, from $186 to $207, the same day as Drake's comments and went on to chart a rise to $289 in the following 11 days.       “Investors likely bought into the promise of ETH 2.0, which is said to scale the Ethereum blockchain significantly,” according to Sharan Nair, chief business officer at CRUXPay and CoinSwitch.co. Also, some investors may have snapped up coins for staking after the protocol upgrade, Nair added.     DeFi growth    The decentralized finance (DeFi) space exploded in 2019, with the total value locked (TVL) in protocols rising from $320 million to $670 million. The TVL rose further to a record high of $1.219 billion on Feb. 15, according to DefiPulse.       “The numbers tell us that investors see DeFi to be truly disruptive and believe it can replace traditional finance, leading to increased accumulation of ether,” said Nair.       MakerDAO, the largest DeFi project, and most other protocols are based on ethereum’s blockchain. Thus, demand for ether may be rising with the growth of DeFi.       The number of ethers locked in DeFi rose from 1.912 million on Jan. 1, 2019 to 2.921 million on Dec. 31. The number increased further to a high of 3.192 million on Jan. 29, before falling back to 2.8 million this week.     Looking forward    With halving due in two months, bitcoin is expected to remain better bid. Notably, historical data show the cryptocurrency tends to hit a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of a halving, before the event.       If history were to repeat itself, bitcoin could clock highs above $13,880 (2019 high) ahead of the reward halving. Such a rally would most likely bode well for ether.       Further, miners and other investors could continue to accumulate ether for staking once the consensus algorithm changes to proof-of-stake.       Staking refers to holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network. Instead of miners cracking algorithms to verify transactions in the proof-of-work (PoW), the proof-of-stake (PoS) users with coins verify transactions in proportion to the amount of coins they have locked in or staked.       The demand for ether through DeFi applications could also continue to grow in the long run, despite the recent hacks, said Abendschein of Digital Assets Data.       On Feb. 14, Valentine's Day, a trader exploited the bZx protocol – the eight-largest DeFi protocol by TVL – via a complex set of transactions and took home $350,000. The platform was again compromised on Feb. 18 with the trader netting $645,000. Since Feb. 17, the total ether locked in DeFi has dropped from 3.07 million to 2.8 million.       “The recent bZx hack may have a short-term negative impact on ether as many investors who previously accumulated ETH due to the faith they had on DeFi might refrain from participating in DeFi ecosystem for a while,” said Nair of CoinSwitch.co.       Nair, however, expects investors to return to DeFi and ether over the long run. “The progress that is currently being shown by the DeFi ecosystem will soon make it lucrative enough for investors to participate again,” added Nair.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/26/the-3-factors-fueling-ethers-2020-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c37a6c7277ab41a676b7de46f40814fede48709-1750x842.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Transcript    Adam: In the pantheon of crypto hacks, “SIM jacking” is one of the worst. The hack, which is less a hack and more social engineering, is basically a form of identity theft, with the attacker swapping a victim's SIM card remotely, usually with the help of your cell-phone carrier, and then breaking into your email, crypto, bank accounts, basically all the stuff you definitely don’t want someone to break into. It's audacious but it’s also preventable with a little awareness. And the consequences can be dire, it’s also netted attackers tens of millions in loot over the past few years.      John: Welcome to CoinDesk Explains, an occasional series from the Markets Daily team where we break down and explore the complex world of Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. I’m John Biggs...      Adam: ...and I’m Adam B. Levine. In today’s tightly connected world it always sucks to lose your phone, but when you add “your money” to that sentence it’s even more painful.      So this time we’re talking about how some people have lost their phones [and], with the help of some clever social engineering, sometimes tens of millions of dollars along with it.      Adam: So John, you experienced this firsthand, right?      John: Absolutely. Back in 2017 some jackass swapped their SIM card with mine, I guess by calling T-Mobile and pretending to be me. They were like, “Hello, this is John Biggs, I upgraded my phone or something and need you to transfer service to my new phone.” Now, clearly this was not me calling, but T-Mobile must have believed them and made it happen.      AND NOW A DRAMATIC RE-ENACTMENT, FEATURING JOHN BIGGS AS THE PHONE COMPANY REP AND ADAM B. LEVINE AS THE FAKE JOHN BIGGS.      John: Thanks for calling your phone company, how can I help you today?      Adam: Hi, yeah, I’m John Biggs and I need you to activate my new SIM card.       John: I’m happy to help you with that. Can you verify your account with your Social Security number, your blood type and your shoe size?      Adam: Actually no, I’m in a big hurry and just need you to help me out.      John: I’m sorry sir, I can’t help you if you can’t verify your account.      Adam: Darn, OK, I’ll call back later.      TWO HOURS LATER      John: Hello, this is another rep from your phone company. How can I help you?      Adam: Hi, I’m John Biggs and need you to activate my new phone.      John: Can you verify your account?      Adam: Nope.      John: That’s fine, let me make that change now.      END      John: It’s pretty much that easy. The real trick is that if you don’t succeed with the first rep, you can call back basically an unlimited number of times until your phone company support slips up, forgets security protocol and agrees to make the change. And these guys are really clever, with like crying baby sounds in the background and stuff.      Adam: That’s the social engineering part. Nobody is actually hacking or attacking your phone itself, they’re taking advantage of the fact that T-Mobile support wants to help you, or at least not get yelled at by you too much. So when somebody calls up and pretends to be you, they can wind up helping someone trying to steal from you instead. So what happened?      John: Yeah, my carrier bought it alright, and helped them out by activating their new phone with my current number. That, in turn, shut off network services to my phone and, moments later, allowed the hacker to change most of my Gmail passwords, my Facebook password and to text on my behalf.      Adam: Ok, so now they have your cell phone, they get your phone calls, they get your text messages and you don’t. But how does that get them the ability to change all those passwords?       John: Just about every service out there from Gmail to Facebook to Coinbase to BYNANCE are concerned that you’re not going to do a good job of managing your passwords. So they did something even more insecure by adding two-factor authentication via text message. A lot of companies have stopped this, but it’s still a huge hole.      Adam: So when your phone became their phone, now they were the ones who could reset your password.      John: That’s right. All of the two-factor notifications went, by default, to my phone number, which was now their phone number, so I received none of the notifications and in about two minutes I was locked out of my digital life.      Adam: Ouch.      John: Yeah… I noticed all of this at about 10 p.m. and I was lucky. I knew what was happening and called T-Mobile. By 10:30 p.m. I reset my old SIM and began the process of changing all of my passwords and hardening my two-factor accounts and T-Mobile account.      Adam: Did they get anything?      John: So, this is a funny story. A week before I was talking to someone in crypto on Facebook. I forget what about. So a few days after that I got a message from that guy on Facebook Messenger saying, “Hey, I’m in a really bad financial situation and I can’t get to my crypto. Can you send me six bitcoin right and I’ll send you eight tomorrow?”      And I’m like “Huh, that sounds like a good deal!”      Adam: Did you send the bitcoin?      John: Luckily, no, but that was the MO. When I was locked out of my accounts, the hackers pretended to be me and asked my friends to send them bitcoin. One of them texted one of my friends and said, “If I don’t get this crypto right now they’ll pull the plug on my dad at the hospital.” They had figured out my dad was sick. And the crypto friend was like “Uh, yeah, that’s not how hospitals work.”      Adam: That’s awful.      There was also the case of Nicholas Truglia, a 21-year-old New Yorker who hijacked multiple phones and actually stole millions of dollars. According to court documents, Truglia is alleged to have stolen from his father and even a dead man.      Most notably, Truglia got Michael Terpin, a cryptocurrency investor. He used one of these socially engineered SIM swaps with Terpin’s phone to steal $24 million in crypto, which led to Terpin opening a $200 million lawsuit against his cell phone provider, AT&T.      John: How much did this guy have? According to court documents, he had a number of Trezors. “One had over $40 million in cash value of various cryptos, and the other one had over $20 million cash value of various cryptos.” It’s nuts.      Adam: So how do you fight back?      John: My buddy Ralph, CEO of Seguru and Oliver Stone’s tech guy, has some ideas. I talked to him today about protecting yourself from SIM hacks.      Adam: So two-factor everything, but not with text messages.       John: Definitely. Never depend on your phone for security. It’s just too dangerous. Always use non-SMS-based 2-factor control.      Adam: Have you gotten hacked recently?       Zohn: <SUDDENLY DIALING IN FROM A TELEPHONE> Not that I can tell.       Adam: Wait, are you calling from your phone?       Zohn: Yeah… Trust me, Adam. Trust me. By the way, Adam, can I borrow two bitcoin until tomorrow? I’ll pay you back three bitcoin in the morning.      <THE SOUND OF FAILURE>",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,"John Biggs, Adam B.

42383369,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vJkX,1582734498,"Software Ate the World, Here's How It Eats Finance","I’ve got a simple, modest goal. Let’s move $15 trillion of global gross domestic product to open-source programmable blockchains. No more, no less.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. He also writes the Future of Finance newsletter.    We don’t need to change the nature of the human animal, short-circuiting its dopamine receptors with moon-shot fantasies. We don’t need to break the artificial intelligence attention platforms, and somehow pull two billion people from one honeypot to another. We don’t need to flip money upside down, throwing a stone into our own bullet-proof window. Those changes are all consequences of what I propose – not precedents. Let us begin instead with all of finance.      To understand the full picture, zoom out for context. Bickering over protocols and forks is a great Twitter strategy. But doing the actual software and market development is what matters. So let’s describe where we are from the perspective of digitization and the global economy.      Over the last several decades, multiple industries have been gutted by disruption. It starts with a cheaper, simpler version of a familiar product, which has some structural advantage. The product improves cumulatively, until the traditional industry can no longer compete, despite its initial market share. Napster pulled apart the music industry such that revenue collapsed 50 percent and the remainder was Spotify, not the music labels. Google did the same to the media industry as it incorporated all of the internet into its advertising maw. Uber leveraged GPS and Apple’s hardware footprint to create a substitute for the traditional taxi, cutting prices of New York taxi medallions by 80 percent. Amazon and Alibaba sliced deeply into retail, pushing cultural norms and payment volume to a new chassis.      In all these cases – which became venture capital cliches because they ring true – something fundamental happened. The software equivalent of the core product in that industry became free to manufacture. I cannot build a Spotify of CDs, but if digital music files are an available Lego piece, then a blue ocean of opportunity awaits. You can think of these developments as fractals emerging from shifting societal tectonic plates. As humanity levels up its technical capabilities, the shape (but not the nature) of human activity changes. We may not know every recursive fold of the fractal, but we know its spiral tendency.    Our advantage lies instead in global networks, public and private chains, and programmable, decentralized finance.    Unlike the examples above, financial services can be a much more difficult beast. Its sectors are highly technical and arcane. Its language is specialized and protected. Barriers to entry come from relationships with power in the form of regulation and licensing, and from network effects in the form of market infrastructure, liquidity and payment rails. It is more difficult for the vector of digitization to digest finance. But like all things, we already know the answer. Revenue pools and fees will continue to collapse, consolidation will create power laws and the remainder of the industry will be natively digital.      Bankers today still struggle with questions about how Amazon and Apple will enter financial services, or whether digital currencies will be launched by central banks, or what shape regulation will take for tokenized assets. The answers are fated – you just need to know where to look.      I segment the financial services industry across (1) sector, and (2) value chain. Historically, financial sectors developed independent infrastructures under separate, local regulations. However, as super apps and bundled fintechs move to consolidate these products in unified experiences, everything starts to meld together. Payments sit on top of information exchanges (i.e., chat apps), rapidly moving value between participants. Once money settles and is no longer in motion, it becomes money at rest – to be banked, lent or invested. And if you are making asset allocation decisions, both in terms of risk management and consumption smoothing, a variety of asset classes become relevant. You may be looking at trading equities frequently or holding a corporate bond for a long time or building out a tax-deferred pension strategy. Hedges, insurance, derivatives and other techniques create further certainty across one’s financial journey.      In terms of the value chain, we can boil this soup down to the essentials. Financial products are made in the factory, manufactured as deposit accounts, exchange-traded funds, underwritten debt or insurance policies. Some capital-provider makes the thing itself from various financial ingredients. They then travel across some middle office or connecting set of providers. Think of CRM, KYC/AML, trading software, collateral management, financial planning, and other feature sets as the intermediating set of steps to get a financial product into the hands of its final customer. At the very end of this labyrinth is some distribution channel – a store. This store may be a bank branch, a financial adviser or a lending officer. Increasingly, it is your mobile phone or some crypto YouTube influencer. Financial products are sold, not bought, which means that distribution remains valuable, regardless of the form.      I say all this to bring us back to the macro story. Over the last decade, venture capital has funded an incredible assault on financial incumbents. Annual investment increased from several billion in the late-2000s to nearly $70 billion per year in 2019. The percentage of venture capital focused on fintech similarly grew from 5 percent to nearly 20 percent. A seismic rebalancing of financial services “disruption” investment occurred – but it focused primarily on distribution. This is why today we have a dozen global unicorns all making the same fintech bundle bet. Though Robinhood, Revolut, Wealthfront, N26, SoFi, Chime, MoneyLion and others started in different verticals, today they face each other for the heart of the millennial customer. It has never been easier to swing for the fences. However, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Santander, DBS, Schwab, BlackRock, Amazon, Apple and Uber are not far behind – the fractal unfolds parametrically.      So what is left for the entrepreneurs? Knowing that finance comprises 20-30 percent of global GDP, what we should do is shift aim towards manufacturing its core product for free. Other entrepreneurs are trying to build the largest attention platforms selling deposit accounts sitting on 30-year old core banking software. Our advantage lies instead in global networks, public and private chains, and programmable, decentralized finance.      Just like Linux powers the majority of mobile operating systems in the world, open-source projects like ethereum (and others) can one day power transaction, market and settlement infrastructure across all asset classes. Trillions in value-added economic activity can flow through modular, expandable rails that standardize and mutualize identity, accounting, financial instruments, and the workflows that today are captured across thousands of niche software platforms. This is the work left to be done!

42383362,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vJbj,1582732802,"Compound Extends DeFi Ethos to Itself, Launches Governance Token","Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Compound is going ahead and decentralizing itself.      ""My personal belief is that nobody would use bitcoin if it was run by the ‘Bitcoin Corporation,’” Robert Leshner, Compound’s founder, told CoinDesk in a phone call. “Its power comes from the fact that nobody truly controls it.”      In that spirit, Compound is launching the testnet of its experimental governance platform today, complete with a trial version of its COMP governance token.      Launched in late 2018, Compound has held steady as a top-three DeFi dapp on ethereum basically as long as DeFi Pulse has been tracking such things. (MakerDAO always sits at number one, while Compound and Synthetix bounce back and forth between two and three.)      Compound currently offers lending in eight different assets (such as wrapped-BTC, ETH and ZRX) and accounts for about 15 percent of all the ETH locked up in DeFi, lately hovering at around a billion dollars.      Community members who feel it should incorporate other assets will now have a much better chance to get their way, because updates will be a matter for users to decide (or COMP token holders, anyway).      ""This has pretty much always been our plan,"" Leshner said. ""We're one of the few companies that are pioneering the idea of continuous and progressive decentralization.""      The company is going to tokenize the dapp, but it is not doing it to raise more money. Instead, its staff, founders and investors will get a share of the tokens and another share will be distributed on ethereum using a logic the company is not yet revealing. Once that's done, token holders will run Compound, not the company.      It should be noted, of course, that while the company itself won't technically hold tokens, the people with the biggest investment in how it has been run so far will have a lot of sway. At first there will be a large concentration of the tokens in the hands of people closest to the company.      This fits into the vision Leshner described of decentralizing but doing so gradually, on purpose.      ""Compound is more like a financial application and infrastructure layer than a blockchain. The accessibility of proposing changes to it is going to be much much more accessible,"" Leshner said.      From here, Compound will focus on building services that run on Compound, much like the company Hadoop does with big-data software.      ""We expect that the company will spend more time looking to develop services on top of the Compound protocol [rather than ethereum],"" Leshner said.      How it works    Anyone will be able to propose changes to Compound, but they won't go to a vote unless 1 percent of the total token supply backs the measure. This could sound like a large amount but delegation is feasible. So someone wouldn't need to own 1 percent of the supply to indicate that amount of support. They would just need to be able to rally that many tokens behind them to move a concept.      Leshner called the 1 percent rule an anti-spam measure. Meanwhile, quorum (the minimum number of votes in play needed to make a change go into effect) will be 4 percent to start.      Once votes start they will run for three days. Then the code change won't kick in for another two days, just to give users of Compound time to close out their positions if they think the change is against their interests (also known as ""rage quit"" in crypto-governance circles).      According to a Medium post on the new governance model:    ""The entire governance codebase is available on Github, and has been audited by OpenZeppelin; an additional security audit is in progress, and will be released shortly. You can request testnet COMP from our team in Discord – just ask nicely!""    When the governance system first goes live, it will only be in the hands of Compound's supporters and team. Once everything proves to be working, the firm will do a token distribution to the public, who will then be able to participate.      The hope is that more people involved will enable the app to expand more quickly but also to do so in a safe way, in part by getting more people involved.      ""By rolling out governance it kind of allows much more creativity and community improvement than we could develop on our own,"" Leshner said.",POSITIVE,BTC | COMP | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | COMP | ETH,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/26/compound-extends-defi-ethos-to-itself-launches-governance-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef032ca6f9d721981f64aa45f8e626d78d2485c2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383359,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vJZD,1582726846,Australian Soccer Club Calls Off Purchase Deal With Controversial Crypto Company,"The owner of a top-tier Australian football club has walked away from buyout negotiations with a controversial cryptocurrency company.      Owner Tony Sage confirmed Monday a deal to sell 80 percent of the equity in Perth Glory FC to the London Football Exchange (LFE) had been scrapped, according to Australian news source The New Daily.      LFE is an exchange, built on the blockchain, designed to allow supporters to trade equity in their favorite clubs. It's understood LFE does not yet hold equity in any football club, and the Perth deal was to be its first-ever acquisition.      Perth Glory confirmed it had entered an ""asset sale and purchase agreement” with LFE in early February. In early January, Sage had been announced as the new LFE chairman to start on March 1.      At the time, LFE CEO Jim Aylward had called the agreement the ""cherry on the cake."" He told followers on Twitter: ""We are building a football group that is going to lead to a tokenized ecosystem, so there is going to be utility for the token.""      However, there have been concerns over the deal and LFE's background.      An investigation by Australian radio station 6PR earlier this week alleged Aylward is actually James Abbass Biniaz, a convicted fraudster who attempted to defraud the U.K. tax office of £98,000 (roughly $126,000). He was sentenced to a 22-month prison sentence in 2010. Aylward reportedly did not deny the claim when asked by the station.      6PR also reported LFE faces a $2.2 million court case brought by a Turkmenistani oil trader who claims the token firm used fraudulent information to persuade him to make a loan to the company.      LFE had previously entered talks to purchase equity in FC Nantes two years ago, but this fell through when the French Club concluded the company's ""seriousness and credibility"" could not be guaranteed.      Confessing to being new to cryptocurrencies, Sage said in a blog post just last week there were numerous ""synergies that can exist between the crypto and the football worlds."" He also asked supporters to try and understand the benefits ""before passing any judgment on LFE or the crypto industry.""      Sage, however, flew to London last week to address mounting concerns by meeting with Aylward in person. Aylward had promised Sage deals with the English Premier League, The New Daily says, but had been unable to explain how the Perth Glory acquisition would be funded.      Following his return, Sage advised the governing body Football Federation Australia (FFE) Monday night the acquisition deal was off.

SIX Swiss Exchange announced Tuesday it has formed a partnership with San Francisco-based institutional solution Omniex to provide SIX and its subsidiary, Swiss Digital Exchange (SDX), with access to cryptocurrency markets.      Thomas Zeeb, SIX head of securities and exchanges as well as a member of the executive board, explained there was a ""growing need"" for platforms like SIX to have access to cryptocurrencies. The tie-up with Omniex will provide the stock exchange with a ""standardized and secure gateway"" in the emerging digital asset market, he said.      ""With SDX as the digital exchange infrastructure in development, the collaboration with Omniex to deliver the front end for clients, both for existing crypto currencies, as well as in future for SDX-listed assets, is an important addition to the digital ecosystem,"" Zeeb said in a statement.      As part of the agreement, SIX also agreed to become a shareholder in Omniex for an undisclosed sum.      With a market cap of more than 1 trillion Swiss francs (just over US$1 trillion) in January 2020, SIX is Switzerland's principal stock exchange. It has listed a series of exchange-traded products (ETPs) that provide exposure to cryptocurrencies in a familiar and regulated tracker product.      SIX launched SDX in 2019 to provide a trusted cryptocurrency trading platform for both institutional and retail traders, but has since narrowed this down to just its professional clients. Although initially slated for the summer of 2019, a spate of departures at the executive level means the SDX launch date has been pushed back to the end of 2020.      Founded by former State Street executives, Omniex raised $5 million in a seed round in 2017. The company provides exchanges with the technology to ensure best execution and minimal slippage when trading cryptocurrencies.      ""Together with SIX we aim to offer an end-to-end solution for the trading and settlement of digital assets, including the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), once operationally live,"" said Omniex CEO and co-founder Hu Liang.

42383354,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vJQP,1582718091,"Crypto Investor's Case Against AT&T Over $24M SIM Hack Can Proceed, Judge Rules","Cryptocurrency investor Michael Terpin can move forward with his case against mobile operator AT&T over claims the telecom was in part responsible for a SIM-swap hack that robbed him of holdings worth $24 million.      In August 2018, Terpin initiated the case against AT&T, alleging an employee, named as Jahmil Smith, had been bribed by a ""criminal gang"" to assist the fraud, which passed control of the investor's SIM card to the hackers. Terpin alleged that while he was on the telecom's hotline trying to regain access to his phone, his cryptocurrencies were stolen by the gang.      In the latest document from the case, filed on Monday, Judge Otis Wright II at the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California denied much of AT&T's most recent motion to dismiss the case.      The court had found in July that while Terpin had sufficiently alleged that the hack was ""reasonably foreseeable,"" he had not shown proximate cause because he did “not connect how granting the hackers/fraudsters access to [his] phone number resulted in him losing $24 million.”      With the investor allowed leave to amend the complaint, Wright found Terpin has now sufficiently alleged proximate cause between AT&T’s conduct and the theft.      AT&T had also contended Terpin did not provide facts to support his claim that two-factor authentication (2FA) was involved in the crime because his cryptocurrency wallets may or may not have used 2FA – an extra level of security that sends a code to a related cellphone number to allow account access.      However, in denying the firm's motion to dismiss, the judge said, ""Mr. Terpin alleges sufficient facts for the Court to reasonably infer the hackers may have used 2FA methods to glean Mr. Terpin’s personal information from various accounts, such as email or cloud storage.""      AT&T had also attempted to have Terpin’s tort claims for financial losses thrown out by contending they are barred by economic loss doctrine, which sets out that parties entering a contract should be able to anticipate any potential losses resulting from a breach of the agreement.      However, if there is a ""special relationship"" between the parties, tort claims can be made if one party breaches the contract.      Judge Wright found that since Terpin was required to share personal information with AT&T ""with the understanding that AT&T would adequately protect it,"" he had sufficiently made a case for there being a special relationship.      On points where Judge Wright did not rule against AT&T in the motion, Terpin has been given 21 days to file an amended complaint to address any deficiencies.      Terpin is suing AT&T for $23.8 million in compensation, as well as $200 million in punitive damages.      In a press release on Tuesday, Terpin announced he will file a second amended complaint before the court's deadline to support his request for punitive damages. He plans to demonstrate ""how AT&T was both knowledgeable of, and responsible for, an ongoing sequence of cryptocurrency thefts due to SIM swaps dating back to well before Terpin’s hack,"" the release states.

A corrective bounce to resistance levels at $9,230 and $9,400 may be seen before a potential drop below $9,000, as the hourly chart is reporting seller exhaustion.  A close above $10,028 (Monday's high) is needed to turn the tide in favor of the bulls.    Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to three-week lows early Wednesday, erasing a significant portion of this year’s price rally.      The top cryptocurrency by market cap slipped to $9,095 at 08:30 GMT to hit the lowest level since Feb. 4, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin’s Price Index (BPI).      With the drop to multi-week lows, bitcoin has retraced nearly 38 percent of the rise from $6,850 to $10,500 seen in the six weeks to Feb. 13.      The rally may continue to unravel as the bears have been looking stronger in the last 24 hours.      The cryptocurrency fell below $9,400 during Tuesday’s U.S. trading hours, confirming a major bearish reversal pattern on technical charts. Additionally, sellers have breached the widely tracked 50-day moving average (MA) support for the first time since Jan. 3.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,140 on Bitstamp, while its global average price as calculated by BPI is seen at $9,175.    12-hour chart    The head-and-shoulders breakdown seen on the 12-hour chart indicates a bullish-to-bearish trend change and has opened the doors for a drop to $8,300 (target as per the measured move method).      The outlook would turn bullish if and when prices rise above the lower high of $10,028 created on Monday.    Daily chart    The MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and gauge trend strength, has dropped to the lowest level since Nov. 26, indicating the strongest bearish bias in three months.      The relative strength index is also reporting a bearish bias with a below-50 print. Further, the cryptocurrency has breached the 50-day average and is trading well below key support at $9,188 – bitcoin had turned lower from that level on Jan. 19.      All in all, the path of least resistance is to the downside. A break below the immediate support at $9,075 (Feb. 4 low) would invalidate the higher lows set up and bring in additional losses.      Popular analyst Josh Rager thinks bitcoin’s convincing move below $9,300 has set the stage for a slide to $8,700–$8,600.      That said, a minor bounce may precede a deeper drop as the intraday indicators are reporting oversold conditions.    Hourly chart    The hourly chart's MACD has printed higher lows, contradicting lower lows on price. That bullish divergence represents seller exhaustion.      As such, a corrective rally to resistance near $9,230 and possibly to $9,400 cannot be ruled out.

Finnish Customs, known locally as Tulli, has been trying to offload a total of 1,666 bitcoin for several years, even drawing up a plan in September 2018 for a public auction of the digital coins. But officials have concerns that a sale would attract the wrong kind of attention and could even put the agency's own security at risk.      Speaking to local media, Tulli Director Pekka Pylkkanen said: ""From our point of view, the problems are specifically related to the risk of money laundering. The buyers of [cryptocurrency] rarely use them for normal endeavors.""      Tulli confiscated the bitcoin trove following a successful bust of an online dark market in September 2016. At the time, bitcoin traded at around $570, meaning the 1,666 BTC was worth approximately $950,000. With prices now just under $9,200, it's worth closer to $15 million, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      At bitcoin's all-time peak near $20,000 in December 2017, the cache would have been worth almost $33 million.      Tulli isn't the only government authority having to decide what to do with confiscated bitcoin, usually with dollar-values many times greater than when they were first seized. The U.S. government, which has seized hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin over the years, has hosted multiple online auctions for confiscated bitcoin.      Bitcoin confiscated by the Belgian authorities was sold by an online auction house in early 2019. Later that year, U.K. police used the same auctioneer to sell more than $290,000 worth of cryptocurrency it had seized from a teenage hacker.      In 2018, the Finnish government barred customs officials from trying to sell seized bitcoin on exchanges or trading platforms, instead ordering the agency to hold any confiscated digital assets in a secure cold storage solution.      Pylkkanen's claim that most crypto holders use them for illicit purposes isn't supported by the numbers.

42383355,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vJUB,1582708212,Malta's Financial Watchdog Highlights Obstacles to Security Tokens After Industry Consultation,"The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) has released a feedback statement, unveiling industry answers to questions regarding offerings of security tokens within the country.      In the document published Tuesday, the EU nation's financial regulator summarized two months of feedback received from market participants over how challenges arising from security token offerings (STOs) ""can be tackled in a manner that does not stifle innovation.""      Beginning in July 19, 2019, the consultation process set out to establish ""legal certainty"" and identify challenges for blockchain-based securities within the Maltese financial markets. Consultation ended on September 16, 2019, with the MFSA having received feedback from 18 industry participants hailing from national agencies, consultancy and law firms, as well as technology providers.      The MFSA focused on the implications of STOs within the framework of European Union legislation, including the Markets in Financial Instruments directive and the Market Abuse Regulation, among others.      The regulator notes in its conclusion that digital ledger-based settlement could provide a ""workable solution."" However, it adds a number of the respondents said that unless there are changes at the EU level relating to central securities depository (CSD) rules, there are obstacles to the introduction of the tech.      Regulations require transferable securities listed at a trading venue must be recorded in the books of a CSD. The means that the ambitions of security token projects to remove the CSD middleman are not possible without ""optimizing"" the legislation for distributed ledgers, the regulator said.      It also flagged that while respondents provided much feedback on the securities part of transactions, not much was said about the cash side of settlement. ""Certain issues would need to be resolved before secondary market trading for security tokens can take off,"" the authority believes.    Clamping down?    Tuesday's release of the feedback comes days after the MFSA published a statement declaring crypto exchange Binance, which proclaimed Malta to be its new home two years ago, was not regulated or licensed to operate as an exchange in its jurisdiction.      According to Decrypt, the feedback statement came in response to an article in the Times of Malta, which said Binance was still headquartered in the nation. The exchange says it currently employs only a few customer service agents in Malta but has been listing the jurisdiction at the top of press releases as recently as this month.      It looks likely Malta is looking to shed its reputation as a hub for money laundering. Over the past two months, its prime minister has stepped down due to his alleged involvement in the cover-up of the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.      Since then, the MFSA has announced the addition of new leadership, including three U.K. nationals ""with vast experience"" in banking supervision, financial crime compliance and conduct supervision.      Part of the shuffling is aimed to help Malta fall more in line with European Central Bank recommendations, according to a press release shared last week.      The MFSA has also been warned it could be placed on the Financial Action Task Force's ""grey list,"" potentially facing legal sanctions, said Chris Buttigieg, MFSA chief officer for strategy, policy and innovation.      ""We need to raise the bar and ensure that there are certain standards and we need to convince our peers and international institutions that we're serious in the way we carry out our supervisory financial processes and our enforcement,"" he said last week, according to MaltaToday.

42383368,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vJjH,1582693200,Error or Plunder? Report Suggests FCoin Purposely Moved Customer Bitcoin Since 2019,"Ever since FCoin fell insolvent this month, blockchain researchers have been poring over data to figure out what caused the failure and where all the China-based exchange's cryptocurrency went.      A recent report from Silicon Valley-based Anchain AI wonders whether funds were pilfered by insiders, challenging FCoin’s official line claiming a data error was to blame. The study is provocatively titled, “FCoin Exchange Shutdown: Technical Difficulties or Planned Scam?”      On Feb. 17, FCoin revealed a shortfall of up to $130 million worth of bitcoin (BTC). The exchange’s verified “cold” wallet, the cryptocurrency version of a bank vault used to hold customer bitcoin, was emptied. According to Anchain AI, from 2019 until February 2020, the cold wallet’s funds were likely moved to four other exchanges — Gate.io, Binance, OKEx and Huobi — and then beyond.      Anchain AI is more upfront about its suspicions than another analysis firm, China-based Peckshield, which reported that Fcoin’s problems started in 2018. According to Peckshield, Fcoin was not properly accounting for transactions on its platform, enabling users to “leak” out valuable cryptocurrencies to other exchanges.       More than 25,350 BTC has passed in and out of FCoin's primary cold wallet, which Anchain AI labeled “Fcoin_1” in its analysis. The last 54 BTC was drained in a transaction sent on Feb. 13. Four days later, FCoin founder Zhang Jian announced the exchange would no longer be able to process customer withdrawals.      A wallet is considered ""cold"" when the private key controlling it is kept offline, on a hardware device or a piece of paper stashed in a safe place. Cryptocurrency exchanges use these wallets for long-term storage of customer assets, with funds rarely moving.      In June 2018, FCoin published its bitcoin cold wallet address on its transparency page. The link now redirects to the exchange's homepage, which displays a note in broken English about “FCoin System Upgrading.""      Fortunately, the cold wallet address was also published in a press announcement in 2018, giving Anchain AI a starting point to analyze over 210,000 transactions among FCoin’s 40,000 wallets. The cold wallet moved 9,889 BTC into another FCoin-controlled wallet, which then dispersed the funds through various other addresses. The Anchain AI analysis found that early in 2019, Fcoin was moving hundreds of bitcoin to other exchanges. Among the four biggest recipients, Huobi, where Zhang was the former CTO, received the most.      For a few months in 2019, there were no exchange transactions. Activity picked up again in September, with OKEx becoming the preferred destination.       Founded in 2018, FCoin used a “transaction mining"" model, reimbursing traders for fees with a proprietary token, also called FCoin. When a customer paid a trading fee in BTC, for example, a corresponding amount would be sent back in FCoin tokens. Holders of this token were also paid 80 percent of the exchange’s fee revenue as an incentive to keep them.      FCoin did not respond to CoinDesk's requests for comment by press time.      Addressing accusations of impropriety, Zhang took to social media to explain that FCoin’s estimated 7,000 to 13,000 bitcoin gap in funds was due not only to poor accounting but also to the transaction mining model. In a missive translated into English and posted to Reddit Feb. 17, Zhang wrote, “in particular, public lies will sooner or later break through under the watchful eyes of everyone.”      Although Anchain AI made a strong case that something was suspicious in FCoin's transactions, its inferencethat the company moved the bitcoin to four large exchanges and thereafter elsewhere is much harder to prove.      As for the title question, Anchain AI's report was inconclusive.      “So, was the FCoin Exchange Shutdown due to technical difficulties, or the culmination of a planned scam? Only the FCoin team would know for sure,” the researchers said at the end of their study.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/26/error-or-plunder-report-suggests-fcoin-purposely-moved-customer-bitcoin-since-2019,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1b50347f2e976d792fce7c228af7b78d2cfcfa7-2560x1693.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
