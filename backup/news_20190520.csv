The United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust, managed by Wilshire Phoenix Funds, would invest exclusively in bitcoin and short-term U.S. Treasury securities, according to a filing made by the exchange late Monday.  Coinbase's custody arm would act as the custodian for the investment trust's bitcoin, the filing said. Working through Coinbase, the trust has obtained up to $200 million of insurance coverage against theft from its hot and cold wallets from ""a syndicate of industry-leading insurers that are highly rated by AM Best.""  This investment vehicle is a separate effort from the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that NYSE Arca and Bitwise are seeking SEC approval to list.  Wilshire filed a prospectus for the vehicle in January, but Monday's filing formally kicks off the regulatory approval process. The SEC now has 45 days to approve, reject or delay the proposed rule change, and up to 90 days to make a final decision, according to the filing.  Monday also saw the SEC delay a decision on a proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF), kicking forward a final determination on that proposed product to as late as October.

Further, the two countries are considering using El Petro, Venezuela's oil-pegged cryptocurrency, as another medium of exchange.  Venezuela's UN representative, Jorge Valero, told Russian house organ Russia Today about the upcoming trade plans.  The Petro is pegged to the value of a barrel Venezuelan oil and the national currency, the bolivar, is pegged to the Petro. Venezuela hopes to avoid sanctions by disconnecting from USD and the Petro is an integral part of this process. It is also ""swapping crude oil for imported products"" according to RT.  RT writes:  The diplomat stressed that the US penalties against the Venezuelan oil sector, along with freezing its dollar accounts, has had an enormous negative impact on the country’s economy. The measures deprived the Latin American nation of free access to international financial support and investments in its oil sector.  The US Treasury imposed sanctions against the Venezuelan government and its crypto exchange Evrofinance after Petro's launch. The treasury wrote that ""Evrofinance’s involvement in the Petro demonstrated Maduro’s hope that the Petro would allow Venezuela to circumvent U.S. financial sanctions.”  Given there are no open crypto exchanges and no real way to pay with crypto in Venezuela, even after months of effort, this effort to route around sanctions appears aimed directly at getting Venezuela's catastrophically broken government back on track but may or may not have much effect on the local economy.

In a new document filed Monday, the SEC said it was instituting proceedings on whether to approve or disapprove a proposed rule change that would allow the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust to issue and list its shares.  The regulator invited comments from the public, due 21 days from when the order is published in the Federal Register, and rebuttals to those comments, due 35 days after such publication.

The VanEck/SolidX bitcoin ETF was first filed last year with Cboe BZX, but was pulled in January due to a long-lasting government shutdown. The companies re-filed the proposal later that month, shortly after Bitwise Asset Management filed its own ETF proposal with NYSE Arca.  The SEC has delayed making any decision on the two proposals so far this year, with the latest delay on Bitwise's proposal coming on May 14.  The regulator has yet to approve any bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., and has so far either deferred making any decisions or outright rejected proposals over the past few years.

In January Cryptopia went offline before announcing that it had “suffered a security breach which resulted in significant losses.” Although the company never disclosed the amount, independent analytics firms estimated that a hacker or hackers made off with over $16 million in ethereum and other tokens.  On May 15 the exchange shut down trading and posted a message regarding liquidation:    ""Despite the efforts of management to reduce cost and return the business to profitability, it was decided the appointment of liquidators was, in the best interests of customers, staff and other stakeholders. ...      “Given the complexities involved we expect the investigation to take months rather than weeks.”    Image courtesy of CoinFirm  Now, according to an analysis by Coinfirm, the hackers are moving that cash into separate wallets, including two CoinDesk found that were directly connected to Huobi.

42381925,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qCVx,1558371609,Coinbase Records Highest Weekly Ethereum Trading Volume Since 2017,"Weekly trading volume for the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market value, Ethereum (ETH), reached its highest notional value in over 17-months on the popular exchange Coinbase.  In Coinbase’s two most popular ETH markets, ETH/BTC and ETH/USD, a combined total of 3,675,570 units of ETH changed hands from May 13 to May 19, which at current market prices ($246) has a notional value of over $904.1 million - its highest total in a week since Dec. 11, 2017 according to data from TradingView.  If the trading volume of Coinbase’s remaining and more recently-added ETH markets (ETH/GBP, ETH/EUR, and ETH/USDC) are added to the mix, a total of 4.271 million ETH moved in that 7-day stretch, activity that was worth over $1.05 billion at current market prices.  ETH/BTC + ETH/USD Weekly Volume (Coinbase)  The forceful return of trading volume during a week in which ETH prices rose 37 percent (USD value) indicates the rally may be sustainable and that retail investors have re-entered the cryptocurrency markets after months of waning interest as a result of falling prices.  Coinbase’s brand recognition is among the strongest in the cryptocurrency exchange sector as its $8 billion valuation and status as the largest US-based crypto exchange make it a primary destination for investors and traders alike who want quick and safe exposure to the market.  Interestingly, weekly volume increases of this magnitude on Coinbase have preceded more significant advances in ETH’s price history.  Since late 2016 and not including this past week, the combined weekly trade volume of Coinbase’s ETH/USD and ETH/BTC markets has exceeded 3.13 million ETH only 4 times and in the six weeks after ETH’s USD price went on to increase 87.1, 91.3, 54.6, and 67.1 percent respectively.  That said, ETH wasn't the only cryptocurrency to flash notable growth last week. Bitcoin (BTC), the sole cryptocurrency larger than ETH by market cap, increased 17 percent in price and climbed to a 42-week high of $8,388.  In all, the value of the broader cryptocurrency market now records $242.4 billion, up 91 percent rom the beginning of the year, according to CoinMarketCap.

42381909,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qCEL,1558370274,MakerDAO Fee Decrease Stalls Amid Decline in Token Holder Voting Turnout,"After an initial round of polling last Thursday, MakerDAO token holders have failed to finalize a decision to decrease fees for users on DAI stablecoin loans taken out through MakerDAO's programmatic lending protocol.  On Friday, a secondary round of polling was launched in order to execute a 2 percent decrease to MakerDAO fees in the system. However, for the first time, the minimum threshold of 117,631.90 MKR tokens was not reached over the weekend and the executive vote remains unfulfilled with a total of 46,546.86 MKR tokens staked.  Taking a step back, MakerDAO is the most popular decentralized finance application in the cryptocurrency industry, according to decentralized application tracker DeFi Pulse. MakerDAO has issued over 81 million DAI tokens backed by the world's second largest cryptocurrency in the world, ether.  For the first time in 5 months, MakerDAO token holders agreed to reduce accumulating interest – called the Stability Fee – on all MakerDAO DAI loans from 19.5 percent to 17.5 percent. However, the majority vote threshold itself was actually reached by a total of two large token holders who collectively staked 54,000 MKR tokens and outweighed other polling options which had a higher number of individual voters but a lower number of tokens staked overall.  ""There are two important signals the community should be monitoring,"" highlighted head of community developer at the MakerDAO Foundation Richard Brown in a Reddit post.""MKR staked, which determines the governance polls, and the overall voter turnout. We need to know as a group if two large holders pushed through a vote, while a majority of smaller holders voted differently. Being able to have this information is important for the community, in order to identify disconnects.""  Brown added in the same post that there is absolutely no MakerDAO token holder large enough to overpower 5 or 6 MakerDAO token holders staking in favor of a competing proposal. However, as noted by a Reddit user in response, token holders no longer feel safe staking their MKR after a critical vulnerability was disclosed roughly two weeks ago that could have frozen user funds.  ""Rich, one of the reason people were panicking is [the] last voting contract had [a] 'bug' and they are not prepared [to] risk large chunk of money until they are 100 percent confident...that new contract is safe,"" wrote ""forextraderaus."" ""[The] new contract has half MKR then the last one, that's why turnout was smaller [than] before.""  Due to the lack of MKR tokens staked in favor of a 2 percent decrease to the Stability Fee, Brown issued an additional Reddit post Sunday questioning whether the token holders should be given more time to stake their tokens or the executive vote should be abandoned all together.    ""Because there can be an assumption that the most recent option presented is 'better' than the last, it's possible to consider the existing system in a state of flux while everyone waits for the votes to come in. What happens though, if the new state isn't approved?"" asked Brown in his post.    He wrote:    ""Does the Polling system have a hard dependency on a recent state change in the system?...How do we know whether the lack of support for a new vote represents support for the old state, or simply a delay in voter activity? When can we expect a state to be considered chosen?""            For now, the executive vote to decrease the Stability Fee is ongoing. In addition, a new governance poll has been entered in to the system posing to MakerDAO token holders an new series of proposals ranging from a Stability Fee of 13.5 percent to 23.5 percent.  ""We don't know if the new executive vote will never be ratified or it will be voted in during the poll. So we've reconfigured the polls to stop talking about relative changes, [that is,] -2 percent or + 3 percent, and instead ask about the absolute values for the fee,"" said Brown to CoinDesk.

The bank said in a news release Friday that it's currently ""exploring options"" for bringing the platform, called Forcefield, to market, and is in discussions with firms in the commodities industry and financial institutions.  So far, it said, Accenture, Anglo American, CMST International, Hartree Partners, ING Bank, Macquarie, Mercuria and OCBC Bank are among those firms that have already signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to launch the platform.  Built using blockchain tech, Forcefield is designed to provide a real-time view into trade inventories.  ABN AMRO explained:  ""The platform can communicate with physical trade inventories through the Internet of Things, sensors and Near Field Communication chips. As a result, the inventories, which are often collateral for loans, can be monitored very effectively, which will lead to more secure physical handling processes and a reduction of costs.""  Over the last year, Forcefield has been developed as a stand-alone product, and saw a ""successful"" proof of concept phase with Accenture taking care of the technology, ABN Amro said. It's now been turned into an independent company with the plan being for it to operate as a market utility, initially focusing on refined metals and later to expand to other ""dry"" bulk commodities.  Karin Kersten, managing director of trade & commodity finance at ABN AMRO, said the platform would ""strengthen the entire commodity trading supply chain. Parties involved will benefit from more effective controls, greater efficiency, transparency and traceability.”  At the same time, the bank – the third largest in the Netherlands – has reportedly backed off its vague plans to launch a cryptocurrency wallet.  ABN AMRO told The Next Web that the ""Wallie"" wallet concept would not be carried through, as crypto assets are currently not sufficiently regulated and therefore ""too risky"" for the bank's investment clients.  Rather than actually developing a wallet, as had been claimed on social media in January, the bank had been soliciting feedback from clients over what functions a possible wallet might need and how it should look, TNW said.  It's the second time the institution has been forced to deny wallet product rumors. Back in 2016, CoinDesk reported that the bank had experimented with the idea of a bitcoin wallet for several years, but the project had been shelved.

London-headquartered Calastone serves over 1,800 customers across 41 countries, including notable entities such as JPMorgan Asset Management. Until now, the network's processes for settling funds were manual-based, including over 9 million messages and transactions worth about $217 billion a month between buyers, sellers and distributors.  With the move to a blockchain-based system, the London-based firm estimates the mutual funds industry will see savings of over £3.4 billion ($4.33 billion) per year.  Campbell Brierley, Calastone's chief innovation officer, said:  “Through Calastone’s blockchain-enabled market infrastructure all participants across the fund’s world can work together seamlessly and view trading activity in real-time. Information now ripples instantly across the market, a step change from the previous, fragmented model.""  ""Financial services firms worldwide can, via the DMI, utilise new services, enhanced capabilities and new investment opportunities, allowing them to evolve their proposition to one that will be more competitive and valuable long-term,"" he added.

Calastone has been working on the blockchain system since as early as 2017, when it completed the first phase of a proof-of-concept for the DMI.

Now users from the U.S., U.K., much of the EU, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan can sign up to earn cryptocurrency rewards for learning about the tech, Coinbase announced in a blog post on Friday. The full list of supported nations can be seen here.  Coinbase Earn was launched last December, and rewards users in cryptocurrency for completing various educational tasks, including watching videos and taking quizzes.  “The rationale behind Coinbase Earn is that as we progress from mining cryptocurrency to buying it to earning it, we open up new opportunities for people to learn about blockchain technology,” Coinbase said.  While, at launch, the program offered rewards in only 0x (ZRX) token, it's now expanded to stellar lumens (XLM), zcash (ZEC) and the Brave browser’s basic attention token (BAT). The exchange said more tokens will be supported soon and added that users must pass an ID check to gain access to the service.  Brave CEO and co-founder, Brendan Eich, commented:  “Like Brave, Coinbase Earn removes intermediaries and inefficiencies so that users can benefit. It's exciting to see Coinbase Earn expand globally so that even more users can get involved with digital assets.”  Stellar Development Foundation co-founder, Jed McCaleb, said that Earn is helping expand Stellar's network, enabling “millions of real and unique users” in over 100 countries to earn XLM while they learn about the cryptocurrency.  Coinbase also said in the post that it's making over $100 million available to users of the scheme. Earlier this month, Earn.com founder and ex-Coinbase CTO Balaji S.

42381929,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qCZj,1558353611,Beyond KYC: Regulators Set to Adopt Tough New Rules for Crypto Exchanges,"UPDATE (June 11, 22:30 UTC): The FATF has set a precise release date, June 21, for the finalized guidance on crypto businesses, a spokesperson said.  The Takeaway  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is set to finalize new international standards for regulating cryptocurrency firms next month.  Those standards are widely expected to subject crypto exchanges, wallet providers and others to the “travel rule” long followed by correspondent banks.  Industry representatives say this requirement would be onerous if not unworkable for crypto businesses, and bad for user privacy.  FATF ""recommendations"" aren’t legally binding, but countries that don’t follow them get blackballed in the global economy.      The cryptocurrency industry is bracing for forthcoming international regulatory standards that would require exchanges to collect and share information about where and to whom they are sending money.  This would go beyond the basic “know your customer” (KYC) rules that bedevil many crypto users. In addition to verifying and keeping records of their own users’ identities, exchanges and other service providers would have to pass customer information to each other when transferring funds, just as banks are required to do. This is known in the U.S. as the “travel rule”.  Many in the blockchain industry have argued that this practice is at best onerous if not completely unworkable with cryptocurrency and apt to drive users away from regulated platforms.  Industry representatives recently made a last-ditch effort to persuade the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body, to reconsider or delay the proposed standard.  About 200 to 300 people, ranging from chief compliance officers of top exchanges to regional bitcoin brokers, attended FATF’s consultative meeting in Vienna, Austria, on May 6–7 to voice their concerns.  But the regulators – particularly those from the U.S., which holds the FATF’s rotating one-year presidency – appeared set on finalizing the standard with at most minor tweaks, according to four people who attended the Vienna meeting and spoke to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity.  Sigal Mandelker, the U.S. Treasury’s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, reinforced that impression in a speech last week at Consensus 2019 in New York.  For one thing, she said the standard was on track for publication next month.  “During its presidency of the FATF, the United States has worked with other countries to clarify how all countries should regulate and supervise activities and providers in the digital currency space,” Mandelker said, adding:  “We anticipate that in June the FATF will adopt a final version of its Interpretative Note, along with updated guidance to further assist countries and industry with their obligations.”  While Mandelker did not mention the travel rule, she referenced the 30-page clarifying guidance on cryptocurrency released May 9 by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, a bureau of the Treasury Department. That guidance cites the travel rule throughout as something cryptocurrency businesses must follow.  “I encourage you all to read it closely,” she said.  Square peg, round hole  The Group of 7 (G7) advanced economies created the FATF to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and the proposed standard seeks to prevent such actors from exploiting crypto.  ""Some of the features of emerging technologies that appeal most to users and businesses – like speed of transfers, rapid settlement, global reach, and increased anonymity – can also create opportunities for rogue regimes and terrorists,” Mandelker said in her speech.  At issue is a single paragraph in the interpretive note on ""virtual asset service providers"" (VASPs), a category that includes exchanges and hosted wallet providers, that FATF put out for public comment in February.  Paragraph 7(b) reads in part:  “Countries should ensure that originating VASPs obtain and hold required and accurate originator [sender] information and required beneficiary [recipient] information on virtual asset transfers, submit the above information to beneficiary VASPs ... and make it available on request to appropriate authorities.”  Likewise, when exchanges receive crypto payments on customers’ behalf, they should have to “obtain and hold originator information.""  To Joseph Weinberg, co-founder of the blockchain startups Shyft Network and Paycase Financial, this is shoehorning digital currencies into analog-era practices.  While the travel rule and similar regulations were written for a world when funds were always sent through intermediaries, “cryptocurrency transactions can occur from person to person, machine, smart contracts, and any other infinite set of potential endpoints – not just exchanges or businesses,” noted Weinberg, who is also an advisor on blockchain issues to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  He added:  “This would become excessively onerous to manage and could drive the entire ecosystem back into the dark ages.”  A compliance officer at a U.S. exchange was more measured in his assessment, calling the pending requirements feasible, but a ""paper-chasing exercise"" and a ""nuisance"" that won't further law enforcement goals.  ""We'll end up bothering good customers and asking them for information we can't verify,"" the executive said.  Illustrating the challenge, Global Digital Finance (GDF), a trade group based in London, noted in an April comment letter to the FATF that unlike a wire transfer, which by design requires bank, branch and account numbers for the recipient, a crypto transaction requires only an address.  Hence, an exchange sending crypto on a customer’s behalf “does not know with any certainty who the destination address is owned by, as there is no register of such addresses and new addresses can be created at any time.” Indeed, the sending exchange can’t be sure whether the recipient address belongs to another business, regulated or otherwise, or to an individual.  Further, the proposed reporting requirements could easily be circumvented, GDF argued. For example, a customer could send funds from an exchange to a non-custodial wallet (where the user controls the private keys). The owner of that wallet could then send the coins to someone at a different exchange, and neither platform would have captured both sides of the transaction.  As such, the standard could have the unintended consequence of “encouraging P2P transfers via non-custodial wallets, which are significantly harder for law enforcement to track or control,” warned the GDF letter, which executives from U.S. exchanges Coinbase and Circle and even bank-owned enterprise blockchain firm R3 co-signed.  FATF has teeth  To be sure, even if the FATF does adopt the guidance with the contentious part intact, the requirements wouldn’t take effect overnight. Member countries would first have to pass legislation or write rules putting the recommendations into effect.  But make no mistake: the oft-used phrase “FATF recommendations” understates the organization’s influence.  ""The FATF recommendations are not legally-binding international law; however, because the FATF's members – 36 economies and two regional bodies – include the largest and most important financial systems in the world, its rules have teeth,” said Julia Morse, Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  “When countries with large financial systems like the United States and the U.K. implement FATF standards, they change how international banks and financial firms do business globally. This creates downstream effects for countries that are not FATF members,” she said.  Further, the FATF examines member countries’ compliance with its standards, and those that don’t follow the standards can become pariahs in the global financial system.  “If non-compliance is severe enough, states/jurisdictions can be placed on a FATF graylist or, eventually, a blacklist. That serves as a strong warning to financial institutions around the world that transactions with those jurisdictions are suspect,” said Mark T. Nance an Associate Professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at North Carolina State University.  For now, industry members are awaiting the final guidance and hoping that governments will give them enough time to agree on a solution for sharing information among companies.  Industry leaders should be “recommending an extended adoption timeframe to ensure proper implementation and coordination across the industry implement,” Weinberg said.  There is some precedent for a grace period: FinCEN finalized the U.S. version of the bank travel rule in 1995 but due to required software changes it was not put into practice until 2004, according to American Banker.  Yet apart from the operational burdens on exchanges and hosted wallet providers, a travel rule-like requirement will likely be anathema to privacy-conscious crypto users.  Already uneasy entrusting their personally identifiable information (PII) to regular hacking targets, the cypherpunk crowd may chafe at having this sensitive data shared with yet more entities.  As Weinberg put it:  “This would eliminate pseudonymity as it pertains to any regulated entity and with it a significant portion of the basic appeal and premise of cryptocurrency.”  Sigal Mandelker image by Anna Baydakova for CoinDesk",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,"Marc Hochstein, Nikhilesh De, Anna Baydakova",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/20/beyond-kyc-regulators-set-to-adopt-tough-new-rules-for-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03ab2b6ed277b251e99779e7ca77db00d36e93fe-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The short-term outlook would turn bearish only if prices find acceptance below the 30-day moving average, currently at $6,239.  Bitcoin (BTC) is looking strong, having registered double digit gains for three consecutive weeks.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value closed last week with 17.5 percent gains, having rallied 22.16 percent and 10.62 percent in the preceding two weeks, respectively, according to Bitstamp data.  The last time BTC witnessed a similar bullish run was in the final quarter of 2017, when the cryptocurrency had logged in double digit gains for five weeks straight to hit an all-time high of around $20,000 on Dec. 17.  The latest weekly winning streak could be extended further, as BTC’s quick recovery from Friday’s lows below $6,100 to a high of $8,299 on Sunday indicates a strong “buy the dip” mentality.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,903, representing a 1.36 percent drop on the day.  Other top cryptocurrencies like ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), binance coin (BNB) and XRP are also reporting moderate losses, according to CoinMarketCap.  Weekly Chart  As can be seen, BTC has logged its first three week run of double digit gains since December 2017.  Notably, prices bounced up sharply from the 5-week moving average (MA) last week and closed on a positive note, reinforcing the bullish view put forward by that ascending average.  There have also been two bullish crossovers in the last week: one of the 5- and 100-week MAs, and another of the 10- and 50-week MAs, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  What’s more, BTC closed well above September 2018 high of $7,411 last week. The cryptocurrency, therefore, appears on track to test the next resistance at $8,500 (July 2018 high).  Daily chart  Bitcoin closed with nearly 13 percent gains on Sunday, marking a strong follow-through to the dip demand highlighted by Friday’s long-tailed daily candle.  The short-term outlook, therefore, remains bullish with scope for a rally to $8,500, as suggested by the weekly chart.  Confirming the bullish case is the positive reading on the Chaikin money flow (CMF) index, indicating increasing buying pressure. Further, the 10-day moving average (MA) is also trending north in favor of the bulls.  The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bearish only if and when the price finds acceptance below the 30-day MA, currently at $6,239. That average resistance was breached with a high-volume rally upside move on Feb. 8 and has reversed pullbacks ever since.  While the weekly and daily charts are biased bullish, the short duration view below indicates a pullback to $7,500 may be in order before a rally to $8,500.  Hourly chart  On the hourly chart, BTC is currently trading above the head-and-shoulders neckline of $7,848, having dived out of a rising wedge – a bearish reversal pattern – in the Asian trading hours.  A head-and-shoulders breakdown would be confirmed if prices drop below $7,848, opening doors for a deeper correction to the $7,500–$7,200 support zone.  That said, with the longer duration charts biased bullish, any dips to $7,500 or below will likely be short-lived.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Sprinkle Group CEO Alexander Wallin told Bloomberg in an interview published Friday, “We have the luxury of being first with this, but we’re aware that it will become a crowded market.”  The Bahrain-based platform, operating within a regulatory sandbox created by the country's central bank, uses a decentralized clearing and settlement system that uses automation in order to reduce time and cost. Prices will be set using the Dutch auction method, with SprinkleXchange taking a 1 percent fee.  Wallin told the news source that the cost of listing would be similar to on a Swedish stock exchange, but ""you get global access and we can show that you also get better liquidity.”  SprinkleXchange is aiming to attract companies with a market capitalization of $20-$200 million. It expects to list 35 companies over the next 12 months and as many as 1,000 over the next few years. As well as listed stocks, the firm will offer trading in cryptocurrencies and also plans to add exchange-traded funds in the future.  A number of traditional stock exchanges are currently moving to integrate blockchain tech in their platforms. Switzerland’s top stock exchange, SIX, for instance, is expected to roll out a blockchain platform to speed up trading later this year.

42381921,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qCQv,1558340438,Cryptocurrencies Pose No Threat to Financial Stability: EU Central Bank,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has said that cryptocurrencies are currently not a threat to financial stability in the euro zone.  In its latest paper on the subject, published Friday, the ECB said the combined value of crypto-assets is small relative to the financial system, and ""linkages"" to the financial sector are still limited. Further, banks in the EU do not appear to have ""systemically relevant"" holdings of crypto-assets.  The ECB also said cryptocurrencies do not perform the functions of money. A “very low” number of merchants currently allow buying of goods and services with bitcoin, and there is no ""tangible impact on the real economy"" or on monetary policy.  The central bank says:  “The high price volatility of crypto-assets, the absence of central bank backing and the limited acceptance among merchants prevent crypto-assets from being currently used as substitutes for cash and deposits, as well as making it very difficult for crypto-assets to fulfil the characteristics of a monetary asset in the near future.”  Regarding the stablecoin concept, the ECB says that cryptos could become less volatile if they were collateralized by central bank reserves. That could bring new issues to address, however: “Such collateralisation could result in additional demand for central bank reserves, which could have implications for monetary policy and its implementation.”  The ECB is also currently not in favor of issuing a central bank digital currency, but is open to exploration due to the evolving digital economy.  ""In principle, a CBDC could be designed as a user-friendly risk-free asset that meets the public’s demand for an economy that is both digitalised and safe,"" the central bank says.  Crypto-assets also come outside the scope of current EU payment services regulation, it continues. Further, under the current regulatory regime, crypto-assets ""can hardly enter EU financial market infrastructures (FMIs).""  The paper states:  ""Crypto-assets cannot be used to conduct money settlements in systemically important FMIs. To the extent that they do not qualify as securities, central securities depositories (CSDs) cannot undertake settlement of crypto-assets. Even if crypto-assets-based products were to be cleared by central counterparties (CCPs), these would need to be authorised and to satisfy existing regulatory requirements, albeit at additional costs and with no clear benefits to EU CCPs.""  However, it concludes that, the risks or potential implications of the technology are ""limited and/or manageable on the basis of the existing  regulatory and oversight frameworks.""  The paper largely echoes sentiments already made public by the ECB. Back in September, the institution's head, Mario Draghi, said that the ECB sees no “concrete need” to issue a digital version of the euro. He also previously said that financial institutions in the EU do not appear to be as enthusiastic about cryptocurrencies as the public.
