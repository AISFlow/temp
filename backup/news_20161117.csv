42378952,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfNN,1479416416,Blockchain Property Rights Startup Bitmark Raises $1.7 Million,"Taiwan blockchain startup Bitmark has raised $1.7m in a new seed funding round.  Cherubic Ventures, a VC firm focused on early-stage companies, led the round. Bitmark, which is developing technology to register user generated content using blockchain tech, raised the funding from a group of investors that also included Digital Currency Group and WI Harper.  Properties registered on its platform are tied to digital assets called “bitmarks” which can be sold and and exchanged with other users, creating an electronic record of their movements. Bitmark is among a growing body of startups seeking to leverage the technology in order to reinforce property rights in favor of their creators.  Bitmark CEO Sean Moss-Pultz said in a statement:  “The notion of property rights in the digital environment is not yet defined. Bitmark changes that notion by giving each of us property rights to our data. You have to own it to make sure that value is clear.”  The startup is currently seeking a patent for its work, according to an application published on 13th October by the US Patent and Trademark Office. The application was first filed on 6th April.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Bitmark.

42378959,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfR9,1479413155,ViaBTC Sparks Bitcoin Scaling Debate in Reddit AMA,"The head of a bitcoin mining pool that has emerged as a strong advocate for a bigger block size argued in a Reddit Q&A today that many in China's mining community support such a move.  ViaBTC founder Haipo Yang took questions during an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on the r/btc subreddit, commenting on the block size debate.  The event saw strong advocacy for Bitcoin Unlimited, a bitcoin software implementation that has been proposed as an alternative to Bitcoin Core, the primary user client for the bitcoin network. ViaBTC was launched in June of this year (and quickly emerged as controversial).  The AMA session came amid the ongoing rollout of Segregated Witness, a change to bitcoin's code aimed at increasing the amount of transactions the network can handle without adjusting the block size. Yet the upgrade has proven to be a controversial one among some bitcoin users, who have argued that an increase in the block size – or a variable size with Unlimited – is the better approach.  Yang claimed in the session that, as it stands, China’s mining community wants a bigger block size, but isn't unified in its support for Unlimited specifically.  He wrote:  ""Most pools in China have lost their trust in Core and shifted their attention to Unlimited. I know a couple of pools said in private that they won't support [Segregated Witness] and will support Unlimited instead. The reason that they haven't shifted to BU is that they are waiting for a better chance and also a possible compromise from Core.""  Elsewhere, Yang framed the current debate as ""a battle about Bitcoin’s future path"", invoking bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto and arguing that Unlimited's approach is more in line with the initial vision of the digital currency.  While the thread largely drew supporters, critics emerged.  One notable inclusion was Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who wrote that Unlimited ""is non-functional"" and ""little tested"", among other critiques.  ""I’ve already clearly stated my view: the protocol is more important than the code,"" Yang wrote in response. ""We've been running Bitcoin Unlimited for more than a month with no problems.""  The push for bigger blocks within China's mining community was also on display during a recent event hosted by bitcoin mining firm Bitmain. This development has largely continued despite the protests of Bitcoin Core and its supporters, who maintain alternatives would be dangerous if more widely used.

42378950,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfJb,1479398489,Dubai Legislators to Discuss Bitcoin Regulation,"Dubai’s government is laying the groundwork for developing legislation around bitcoin and digital currencies.  The Supreme Legislation Committee in the Emirate of Dubai, in partnership with the Dubai Electronic Security Center, is set to hold a one-day gathering entitled “Virtual Currencies: Fact and Law” on 20th November. Government officials from both local and national-level jurisdictions are expected to attend.  Ahmad bin Meshar Al Muhairi, secretary general for the Supreme Legislation Committee, said of the event:  “The move is part of our continuing efforts to build a legal knowledge base in line with our strategic objectives in strengthening the legal system and developing the legislative process to achieve the objective and realistic requirements for drafting leading legislation that simulates reality and outlooks the future.”  That Dubai would at least begin putting the pieces in place to create comprehensive legislation around bitcoin is perhaps unsurprising.  Since the start of this year, its government has aggressively pursued research into the technology, partnering with regional bitcoin startups like BitOasis. Those early steps had developed into proofs-of-concept by the spring, including plans to use blockchain to back up government documents and create connected device networks.  For now, Dubai’s legislative body appears to be in a learn-and-see stage.  In statements, Al Muhairi argued that the venue would provide an opportunity for members of Dubai’s government to gain a better understanding of the tech.  “This will acquaint them with the ways international law deals with ‘bitcoin’, which is now officially recognized worldwide due to the accelerated pace of the smart transformation,” he said.

42378964,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfbD,1479394667,6 Takeaways From CoinDesk's Q3 State of Blockchain,"CoinDesk's Q3 2016 State of Blockchain report summarizes key trends, data and events in the public and enterprise blockchain sectors from the third quarter of 2016  This article previews six of the key takeaways as identified by our research team. For more of our quarterly and annual reports, visit CoinDesk Research.  It's no secret that what the world calls ""blockchain"" has evolved.  From its invention for the bitcoin blockchain to its implementation in new alternatives that take the idea in unintended directions, this expansion has had a dramatic effect on the industry.  Likewise, with CoinDesk's Q3 State of Blockchain, we continue to attempt to reflect these changes in the taxonomy of the report.  Once dedicated solely to developments on the bitcoin blockchain, the report now is divided into two sections, one on public blockchains (profiling bitcoin and ethereum) and the other on enterprise blockchains (capturing startups like R3CEV, Chain and DAH).  Our full report offers a number of takeaways, though most are centered squarely on how this delineation is impacting the market.  For example, amid this diversification of interest, data shows investors are becoming less certain about industry startups, as evidenced by a decline in smaller and earlier-stage investments.  The amount of venture capital committed to blockchain-based companies reached just $114m in Q3, though two large investments in Ripple ($55m Series B) and Juzhen Financials ($23m Series A) accounted for nearly 70% of this figure.  Investment for the period was also down 17% year-over-year against the $155m invested in the industry in Q3 2015, and 18% year-to-date against the $458m invested from Q1 to Q3 in 2015.  Elsewhere, the impact of this change is being felt in measurable new ways.  1. Blockchain investment is declining and the trends are unclear  One reason for the declines may be a shift in how startups are approaching the market.  As evidenced by Ripple and Juzhen's funding, more money is being awarded to startups that are seeking to work alongside (rather than against) big industry incumbents.  This means that as more older blockchain firms seek new revenue streams, CoinDesk Research is classifying more startups as hybrid blockchain businesses.  Companies like Blockstream, Paxos and Ripple, for example, don't precisely fit into the public or enterprise blockchain taxonomy. In the case of Paxos, for example, the company has a separate division (itBit) purely devoted to public blockchain.  This has led CoinDesk Research to split its classification system, dividing infrastructure into two categories (public and permissioned blockchains) and startups into three (public, enterprise and hybrid).  Our report indicates the majority of venture capital in the quarter was invested in hybrid blockchain technology startups, a sign that perhaps the uncertainty at the infrastructure layer is migrating upwards.  But, there isn't enough data to call this a trend. In fact, the dominant mood may be the mismatch between interest and investment as evidenced by a continued lag in enterprise and alternative blockchain investment.  For example, despite the belief that ethereum could come to be one of the more important public blockchains through its novel use of smart contracts, its startups have yet to attract significant funding.  Enterprise blockchain projects are moving to market, but slowly.  According to CoinDesk Research, at least 70 distinct proof-of-concepts (PoCs) devoted to the technology have been launched, with these projects seeing involvement from more than 100 participants.  Yet, as in the investment sector, financial incumbents have yet to signal to the market the types of projects they deem as the most viable.  In attempts to classify publicly announced PoCs, CoinDesk Research found that they have been directed at as many as 25 distinct topics. Early indications suggest banking, insurance, post-trade settlement and trade finance could emerge as likely areas of future implementation.  However, here the data isn't exactly clear.  More notable are the upticks in participation from major banks and stock exchanges, which are to date the most active sector.  While digital currencies (or digital assets, as they are sometimes now called) have a reputation for volatility, there are signs that the market has at least reached consensus on which ones it sees the most future value in.  One of the more notable findings of the report is that the top four cryptocurrencies by market cap were the same in Q1 as they were in Q3.  Bitcoin remains the largest (with nearly $10bn in market cap), but others are gaining interest, most notably ethereum (its digital currency ether is the only other to boast a market cap above $1bn).  Yet, bitcoin's market share is declining, indicating that investors in the public blockchain space perhaps see the potential for the ""blockchain"" of the future to be a fabric of multiple blockchains.  In total, the percent of the total cryptocurrency market cap held by alternative cryptocurrencies rose to 21% in Q3, up 2% from Q2 and 4% from Q1.  Supporting the conclusions above is that many formerly bitcoin-first startups are signaling support for alternative digital currencies (by offering services to their blockchains).  Perhaps nowhere has this been more apparent than in the exchange sector, as nearly all the top bitcoin exchanges now offer support for ether, the native currency on the ethereum blockchain.  CoinDesk Research finds that public blockchain startups seem increasingly keen to offer support services to multiple blockchains, provided there's an easy way to adapt there services for the market.  For example, exchanges and miners have shown the most support for ethereum, with startups dedicated to providing consumer onramps to bitcoin perhaps emerging as a notable holdout.  Among major bitcoin brokerages, for example, few are offering buy and sell services for more alternative cryptocurrencies.  But while the bitcoin industry sees a business opportunity in alternative blockchains, the media has perhaps been slow to adapt.  CoinDesk Research finds that despite growing blockchain hype, bitcoin remains the predominant area of focus for major media publications.  One reason for this lag may be that major search engines show that potential readers are still enamored with the ability to earn money from interest and activity in the public blockchain markets, namely bitcion.  As shown in search queries, ""price"" remains the most popular supporting term for ""bitcoin"" and ""ether"" searches.  In the world of government, activity is increasing in line with emerging enterprise and continued public interest.  CoinDesk Research reveals that major financial institutions around the globe are now exploring the technology, though there has been a notable uptick in government interest in Asia.  As shown by recent announcements from the government of Singapore in Q4, this trend is showing no signs of slowing.  Perhaps most encouraging for the technology is that with top central banks exploring the technology, there remains the possibility that they could even come to play an active role in encouraging and promoting its development in Q4 and beyond.

42378966,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfZx,1479394525,CoinDesk Research: Ethereum Hard Fork Had Little Impact on Sentiment,"CoinDesk's Q3 2016 State of Blockchain report summarizes key trends, data and events from the third quarter of 2016  This article highlights findings from our quarterly 'Spotlight Study', based on a survey of 240 startup execs and enterprise blockchain leads. For more of our quarterly and annual reports, visit CoinDesk Research.    Read the entire Q3 2016 State of Blockchain report.    Despite being labeled as another Mt Gox, the demise of ethereum's first major project (the DAO) as well as subsequent, controversial attempts to save its investors, had little to no impact on the platform's use or perception, a new CoinDesk study has found.  Conducted in October 2016, CoinDesk Research found the majority (63%) of industry entrepreneurs and enterprise executives surveyed reported no change in their use of ethereum following the hack or hard fork, with nearly half (48%) indicating it did not negatively impact their perception of the emerging technology.  Perhaps most notably, respondents indicated they believe ethereum’s developer team to display stronger governance practices than bitcoin, the most widely used public blockchain and most valuable digital currency ahead of ethereum and ether, respectively.  In total, 37% reported ethereum had better governance than bitcoin, while 22% said bitcoin displayed better governance.  Of note is that 34% said both displayed serious governance challenges, a figure that could explain the continued interest in private blockchain efforts.  The findings are notable as CoinDesk Research further revealed that the DAO collapse and hard fork had a measurable impact on users.  Of those surveyed, the events had a negative impact on one-third of respondents, and of those affected, 75% reported that they lost money.  A small percentage of respondents (11%) even lost confidence in ethereum completely following the hard fork, with some (20%) reporting a project setback as a result of the twin incidents.  However, these weren't the only findings from the extensive survey. Below, we highlight the five biggest takeaways from our research:  1. Hard fork won over critics  While we know the decision to split the ethereum protocol effectively split the blockchain community, what was most notable was that few respondents changed their view over the course of the events.  CoinDesk Research found that 8% of respondents changed their view after the hard fork, but that of those who did, 88% now view the decision to hard fork favorably.  The results suggests that despite claims by some ethereum users that the fork violated the reliability of its blockchain, this argument has perhaps not resonated widely.  In total, 45% of respondents agreed with the hard fork, with 33% disagreeing and 23% reporting that they were unsure of how to feel about the event.  Governance was the primary concern for those who expressed negative sentiment towards either the hard fork or DAO hack.  Almost half of those negatively impacted by the events were concerned with current and future governance of the protocol. Others expressed strong concerns over compromised immutability and fear of impending regulatory risk as a result of the fork.  While the DAO hack and hard fork certainly had a negative impact on ethereum, these events had a material impact on the perception of other projects, the survey found.  Notably, 39% of respondents believe the DAO hack and hard fork cast a positive light on bitcoin, with some referring to the protocol as ""production-ready"" while emphasizing its ""stability and predictability"" in comparison to ethereum.  Conversely, half of respondents suggested the hard fork ""broke immutability"" and ""set a bad precedent"" for the one-year-old protocol.  Yet, the survey did point to potential problems ahead.  The results show 40% of respondents believe that it's somewhat or very likely that ethereum will be ready to implement an entirely new blockchain protocol (Casper) sometime next year.  Other big technical challenges are expected to be overcome as well, as one in three respondents expected ethereum to be equipped with state channels, an in-development feature that would allow for greater scalability.  However, the roadmap for such advances remains unclear, with leading technologists spearheading the work reporting disagreements on the best path forward.  As identified in CoinDesk Research's 'Understanding Ethereum' report, a leading concern for the platform has long been the sky-high expectations of users, which seem to continually outpace the modest declarations from developers that the tech remains bleeding-edge.  CoinDesk Research also found evidence that ethereum displays two distinct classes of users, those using its public blockchain and those using private alternatives.  As the technology is open-source, many enterprises have taken to replicating ethereum’s technology for their private use. Notable is that both groups emphasized different qualities about ethereum when reporting their satisfaction with the platform.  Overall, enterprise users were more likely to emphasize its appeal to developers, as well as its flexibility and maturity, while public developers were more apt to cite its technical features, such as a Turing-complete programming language and smart contract capabilities.

It’s not a goal without a sense of gravity, as China produces about a quarter of the world’s carbon emissions. Though the use of coal has fallen in China, projects like the IBM-Energy Blockchain Labs initiative could push more companies to take action on the technology side.  The test is the latest for IBM in China. The technology firm has worked with other firms including credit card company China UnionPay and Walmart’s regional subsidiary to develop applications.

42378956,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfPt,1479389408,How the SEC's Blockchain Lead is Defining Future Regulation,"In a sign of how serious state powers are taking the emergence of blockchain, the most powerful regulatory body in the US now has a working group dedicated to protecting its users and investors from fraud in the sector.  The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the agency whose mandate is to create fair and efficient markets, is also now emerging as a public voice in the industry, spotlighting the technology at an event this week in Washington, DC.  Both developments signal that progress is being made. Yet for some industry observers, the statements will likely fall short – some of the most important questions facing entrepreneurs and investors building with blockchain technology remain largely unanswered.  And it appears that isn't likely to change soon. The head of the SEC's distributed ledger working group, Valerie Szczepanik, isn't able to speak about her plans for blockchain regulation or how the agency will pursue enforcement in the industry.  But for the first time with a member of the media, she elaborated on the working group's internal structure, how it operates with other departments in the SEC and how serious the regulatory body is taking its exploration of blockchain.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Szczepanik explained the influence of the group and why the SEC is taking an increasingly public stance on the issue.  She said:  ""It should signify to the industry that we are seriously looking at these areas — that we’ve been thinking about them, that we’ve been keeping up to speed and that we are studying the regulatory issues.""  Founded in 2013 as the Digital Currency Working Group, the organization has since changed its name to the Distributed Ledger Technology Working Group (DLTWG).  In the group’s early days, its mission tended to align with Szczepanik’s role as the assistant director of the SEC division of enforcement. Since then though, it's expanded to include 75 diverse members.  Participants sign up via an internal listserv and work to train their peers on distributed ledger technology while bringing in outside consultants to explain the technology and increase the agency's awareness and education.  To help minimize redundant projects, members in every division of the SEC coordinate behind the scenes. (One of the group's goals is to learn about the emerging risks created by distributed ledger technology). The DLTWG also coordinates cross-agency regulatory efforts with federal, state and local law enforcement.  For example, the SEC's Specialized Working Group on Equity Market Structure has its own Blockchain Task Force. Employees continue work on their cases while keeping an eye open to how blockchain impacts other divisions of investment management or trading and markets.  Creating crypto-products  Though exact details of the current work remain sparse, what is becoming increasingly clear is that the SEC plans to take its time before granting any future permissions to blockchain companies.  Of note are the many issues discussed in public filings so far this year, including the application of existing laws to bitcoin financial instruments. For example, the SEC is currently working with two separate exchanges competing to be the first to host a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF).  In September, the SEC delayed its decision to approve or refuse SolidX's request to list a bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange. Then a month later, the regulator posted a request for additional comments about Gemini's application to the Bats Exchange.  Perhaps the regulator’s most notable action this year wasn’t for granting permission, but for a cryptocurrency settlement. In July, the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order against the OTC-traded Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), founded by Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert.  Its authorized participant SecondMarket was ultimately asked to disgorge $50,000 in fees it had collected, though no parties admitted or denied charges.  Taking crypto-stock  But the truly disruptive power of blockchain won't be just in the form of new bitcoin-related products sold via major exchanges – last year, the SEC approved online vendor Overstock's plans to issue securities on its own custom-built blockchain stock exchange.  Following a partnership announced earlier this month with Connecticut-based investment bank Source Capital Group, Overstock's offering is slated to begin trading in December.  But even this model faces potential disruption, and so far, the SEC has remained noticeably silent on the matter.  Since an ethereum startup called The DAO raised over $100m by selling digital tokens without an exchange, a rush of companies have followed suit.  So-called initial coin offerings can be launched from anywhere in the world and cross borders as easily as the Internet itself. With millions of dollars worth of capital raised so far and dozens of ICOs in the works, how the SEC will handle the technology is one of the biggest areas of regulatory uncertainty in the industry.  Regardless of whether Gemini and SolidX ever win approval or if ICOs might displace traditional fundraising, the SEC will likely play a role.  Turbulent times  In SEC chair Mary Jo White’s last address to the public before announcing her impending resignation, she explicitly listed the Distributed Ledger Technology Working Group as ""carefully evaluating when and how this technology will be on-boarded within the securities market"".  Among the blockchain disruptions White says the SEC is watching, she listed interoperability, scalability, whether systems should be permissioned or not and how secure is the customer data and assets on a blockchain.  ""To the extent there are real benefits to participants in the financial services sector and their customers, especially to back-office functionality,"" she said. ""We are considering whether this technology will obviate certain services and participants or, rather, be adopted into current infrastructures.""  The SEC joins regulators around the world working to strike a balance between the potential benefits of distributed, shared ledgers and the potential risks.  Last month, Swiss lawmakers announced their own plans for blockchain regulations, and in August, both Singapore and the UK revealed similar measures.  To serve and protect  As these global regulators work to weave their various blockchain efforts together, some things will likely stay the same.  On Monday, Szczepanik moderated a panel on how distributed ledgers have already changed the way the financial sector thinks about post-trade, and how it will change those services in the future.  The consensus among the panelists was that the changes would run deep into how the SEC does its business, especially the technical qualifications of many of its employees. But what won’t likely change are the principles of risk management and transparency on which the regulations are built.  Following the panel, Szczepanik reiterated a theme the panelists had also explored, emphasizing that however the agency decides to approach the technology, its vision will remain consistent with its mandate.  She concluded:  ""Our rules and regulations are there for a reason. They’re there for investor protection. And so we would hope that thought is given to how the technology and investor protection can be balanced so that everyone benefits.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.
