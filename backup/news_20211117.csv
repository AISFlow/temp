42424272,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mL9h,1637191800,"First Mover Asia: Altcoins Surge as Bitcoin, Ether Stall","Good morning, Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Crypto.com’s CRO token moons on deal with Los Angeles’ Staples Center, as bitcoin stalls.  Technician’s Take: The long-term uptrend remains intact despite slowing price momentum.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $58,838 -1%  Ether (ETH): $4,226 -.49%  Market moves  Bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, were afterthoughts on Wednesday as a handful of alternative coins turned heads in digital-asset markets.  The day’s big story was Crypto.com’s CRO token, which shot up some 26% to a new all-time high after the crypto exchange and credit-card issuer announced a naming-rights deal with the Staples Center in California, home of the Los Angeles Lakers pro basketball team. The token was a standout performer in mid-2020 but had not attracted much notice since then.  Avalanche, a smart-contracts blockchain set up to compete against Ethereum, was another winner as its AVAX token surged to a record high after a new partnership with accounting giant Deloitte was announced. Crypto analysts said the network has benefited from more than $600 million in incentives and development fund awards announced in the past few months.  What about dog tokens dogecoin and shiba inu coin? Well, they’re hanging their heads these days, well off the all-time highs reached earlier in the year, with even seemingly positive news these days doing little to perk up the ears. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone wrote Wednesday in a report that the memecoins might be ready for “purging, so as to move on with the adoption process of crypto assets in investment portfolios.”  In traditional markets, stocks fell as some traders worried that the fast inflation increase might push the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than previously expected, even as oil slid to a six-week low around $78 a barrel.  An accelerated response by the Fed to withdraw monetary stimulus might curb bitcoin’s appeal as an inflation hedge while also crimping the momentum for high-risk, high-return assets.  “Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish, but the waters over the next few months will be rough as institutional investors look to see if the Fed will be forced to raise rates sooner and trigger a broad-based selloff of risky assets,” Edward Moya, senior markets analyst for the foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote Wednesday.  Matt Blom, of the crypto firm Eqonex, says $61,750 represents a key price level for bitcoin. Above that, prices could head back toward $65,000; below that, they could revisit $58,850 or even $56,670.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Holding Support at $60K; Could Face Resistance at $63K-$65K  Bitcoin (BTC) was stabilizing around the $60,000 support level after declining about 15% from an all-time high near $69,000.  The cryptocurrency is roughly flat over the past 24 hours and could see further upside toward the $63,000-$65,000 resistance zone.  Both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages are sloping upward, indicating a positive intermediate-term trend. This means buyers could remain active on pullbacks given strong price support above $53,000.  For now, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is below a neutral reading of 50, which means a period of consolidation could continue until a decisive breakout or breakdown is confirmed.

42424258,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mKnh,1637189000,ConstitutionDAO Raises $27M on Eve of Sotheby’s Auction. $PEOPLE Could Be the Reason,"Crypto nerds are on the precipice of pulling off the caper of the century.  What started as a longshot bid for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to buy one of 13 original copies of the United States Constitution is looking more and more possible as the group has now raised $27 million and counting, well above auction house Sotheby’s upper estimate of a $20 million price.  ConstitutionDAO, which formed last Thursday, has raised the sum from over 7,600 addresses after a surge in large donations on Wednesday signaled confidence from whales, or large holders, that the plot might succeed – and that the venture could end up being profitable.  Read more: ‘I Think We’re Doing This’: Inside One DAO’s $20M Plot to Purchase the US Constitution  The achievement earns the DAO a number of superlatives, including status as possibly the largest DAO ever – and at the very least certainly the largest DAO ever assembled for the purpose of purchasing an 18th-century legal document.  Attention now turns to the auction on Thursday, where the group will attempt to outbid a field of at least half a dozen private collectors also looking to own a piece of history.  Late push  The DAO’s outlook was not always so rosy. Midday Wednesday, the effort had only managed to attract 3,000 ETH over roughly 48 hours, with whales accounting for a disproportionately high percentage of donations – 17 Ethereum addresses accounted for roughly half the sum collected.  However, whales appear to have attracted the chum.  In just a few hours the total number of donating addresses jumped from 5,000 to 7,600, and the amount raised from $13 million to $27 million.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Yossi Hasson, the founder of non-fungible token (NFT) investment firm Metaversal and holder of the current top spot on the donation leaderboard, said the DAO has additional funding on deck in case someone offers a counterbid beyond the DAO’s publicly known means.  “We’re pretty confident we’re going to win,” Hasson said. “There are multiple strategies being discussed of how much of the capital that is being committed should be completely on-chain and visible before the auction, how much will be brought in after the auction. We don’t necessarily want others to know exactly the cards we’re holding.”  Legal questions ironed out  When donations opened, the frenetic nature of the DAO meant that it was somewhat up in the air to what people were donating exactly.  Early ideas included fractionalizing the document or burning it and reissuing it as an NFT (a la a stunt with a Banksy piece in March).  However, the real-world identities of multiple members of the DAO’s brain trust – roughly three dozen individuals – are known, and now an actual LLC will be placing the bid on behalf of the DAO to comply with Sotheby’s know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Additionally, fractionalization could lead to an unusually easy-to-pursue securities enforcement action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), per early discussions in the DAO’s Discord.  We the $PEOPLE  The current plan is to issue a governance token – called PEOPLE – that enables holders to vote on decisions concerning the preservation and display of the document. PEOPLE is currently being distributed at a rate of 1,000,000 PEOPLE for each ETH donated, but as of yet is not being traded.  “This isn’t an investment, and that needs to be clear to people participating,” said Hasson. “You’re not owning a fraction of the Constitution; rather, a token that gives a say in governance. It’s an important distinction.”  Despite not being an investment, that doesn’t mean the tokens can’t or won’t have monetary value.  Indeed, fractionalized NFTs can often reach market capitalizations orders of magnitude larger than the value they held as single tokens.  The trend is even becoming a kind of business model: SZNs, a project enabling DAOs to form around the ownership of NFT collections called albums, raised $4 million in a seed round in September.  Read more: Fractionalized NFTs Get Funding Boost as SZNS Raises $4M From Framework, Dragonfly  Many of those contributing ETH to the project may be making a bet that $PEOPLE could see a price rise after its issuance.  Hasson, meanwhile, told CoinDesk that Metaversal’s “primary goal” was to help preserve a piece of history and “give it to the people,” but that price appreciation could be on the table.  “At Metaversal we do believe you can do great by doing good,” Hasson said. “We’re able to contribute in the preservation of such an iconic, historical document – bring it into the Metaverse and let its story be told in new and novel ways – and if the $PEOPLE token appreciates as part of that, we’ve accomplished both of our goals.”  UPDATE (Nov. 18, 0:15 UTC): Adds current status of PEOPLE token.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | PEOPLE,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/17/constitutiondao-raises-27m-on-eve-of-sothebys-auction-people-could-be-the-reason,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89768a6a8c49dc24b2ca3739ee72e8e0e52fefc1-2524x1683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the announcement Wednesday, the Edinburgh-based BetDEX called the raise the “largest-ever seed investment round by a U.K. startup.”  Exchange giant FTX and San Francisco-based crypto venture firm Paradigm led the round, which also included participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sino Global Capital and Solana Ventures.  Scotland-based BetDEX is building its protocol on the Solana blockchain with hopes of becoming “a global clearinghouse for sports wagering,” according to a blog post.  Third parties will be able to use BetDEX’s back-end infrastructure to run their betting platforms, which takes advantage of Solana’s high transaction speeds and low fees. BetDEX says its protocol will charge a fee of less than 1% on net winnings, undercutting centralized competitors like FanDuel and DraftKings who typically charge 2%-5%.  The company also plans to build its own betting platform on the protocol, which has yet to be named. BetDEX will accept wagers in USDT, SOL and SAMO at launch, according to the announcement.  The company is led by three former executives of FanDuel, which holds 36% of the current online sports betting market share. Nigel Eccles, who serves as BetDEX’s non-executive chair, is a FanDuel co-founder and served as the company’s CEO.  With the U.S. crypto betting market still in its infancy, BetDEX is targeting European and Asian markets, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk. Wyoming is currently the only U.S. state with legalized cryptocurrency sports betting.  “It is mind-boggling that more sports wagering does not occur on exchanges,” FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said in the BetDEX press release. “We firmly believe in giving consumers the ability and control to set their own price and are excited to partner with BetDEX to bring this vision to fruition.”",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | SPONSORED | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/17/solana-based-sports-betting-protocol-betdex-closes-21m-seed-funding-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61ea25da56c201549c8f18c46188a4f23ff2366a-1500x1035.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some analysts remain bullish on BTC’s price due to improving blockchain data, suggesting the current pullback could be short-lived.  “The drop seems to be related to excessive leverage in the system being flushed out,” Jan Wuestenfeld, an analyst at CryptoQuant wrote in a blog post. “As long as on-chain fundamentals do not change on these price corrections, the medium-term outlook remains bullish,” Wuestenfield wrote.  Technical indicators show a positive upward trend for BTC, which means buyers could remain active on pullbacks. Still, the $63,000-$65,000 price zone could limit further upside over the short term.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $60,374, +0.85%  Ether (ETH): $4,257, +1.17%  S&P 500: $4,688, -0.26%  Gold: $1,866, +0.88%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.59%  Leveraged liquidations  The chart below shows elevated funding rates (the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures listed on major exchanges) in bitcoin and ether. The recent rise in funding rates indicated a greater appetite for leverage among traders, some of whom became vulnerable to liquidations as prices dropped.  As markets stabilize around current levels, funding rates have reset back near neutral territory, according to Joo Kian, an analyst at Delphi Digital, a crypto research firm.  “Prior to this, open interest was at peak levels for most trading pairs; typically, flushing out excessive leverage is healthy for markets over the longer term,” Kian wrote.  Separately, in the bitcoin options market, open interest (contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade) is near all-time highs last seen during March and April, which preceded a significant price drop. It is possible that open interest can remain around current levels for another month before a sustained downturn in BTC’s price.

The Singapore-based crypto exchange bought the naming rights from AEG for 20 years for $700 million, the LA Times reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.  The CRO price rose 35% in the past 24 hours to 54.5 cents in digital-asset markets, pushing the reported market capitalization to $13.7 billion.  Among the largest cryptocurrencies, the CRO token’s staggering one-day return was almost triple the gains of the next-best performer, Avalanche’s AVAX token, which rose 12%.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was up 0.8%, roughly the same as for the Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH).  The CRO crypto coin was a top performer among digital-asset markets in 2020 but more recently had failed to generate much attention from speculators (or journalists) – until now.  Under the agreement, Crypto.com will also be an official partner of the LA Clippers and pro hockey’s LA Kings. The crypto exchange’s logo already adorns the jerseys of the National Basketball Association Philadelphia 76ers team.

The company said Wednesday that Salvadorans will now be able to pay for more than 150 services with bitcoin on Bitrefill’s platform through Lightning Network or on-chain transactions.  Among the services available to pay with bitcoin are bills from the Social Fund for Housing, a government institution that provides loans for home purchases; and AES, a company that provides electricity in the Central American country, the company announced during the Adopting Bitcoin conference held in El Salvador.  Bitrefill will provide the service in El Salvador through PuntoXpress, a local platform that allows the payment of basic services and cell phone recharges. To carry out the process, users must provide an email address to receive a receipt and, if applicable, claim a voucher code, Bitrefill said.  El Salvador established bitcoin as legal tender on Sept. 7 and also launched Chivo, a government wallet that supports U.S. dollar and bitcoin. The Bitcoin Law stipulates that businesses must accept bitcoin as a form of payment, although there is some confusion about its exact requirements.  “Even with the government’s mandate to make bitcoin legal tender, some businesses and services have yet to accommodate the payment method into their operations,” Bitrefill stated, adding that the company will give businesses a solution to accept bitcoin without the need to fret over custody or liquidation.

42424267,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mL1h,1637180658,"Shiba Inu Coin Faces ‘Reversion’ Worthy of Parabolic Rise, Analyst Says","Send the dog tokens to the doghouse.  That’s the message from some cryptocurrency analysts who say the stunning rise this year of dog-themed tokens like dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) represents little more than speculative froth that might hinder the fast-growing digital-asset industry’s credibility.  These “dog tokens” or “meme tokens” were created as a joke but have attracted a wide following of speculators and fans. And as a result they’re still not taken as seriously as other cryptocurrencies that are seeing as bellwethers of the fast-moving blockchain technological movement.  “We say the sooner the better for the speculation machine coins to experience some purging, so as to move on with the adoption process of crypto assets in investment portfolios,” Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone wrote Wednesday in a note.  The latest calls come as both DOGE and SHIB were trading well below all-time highs reached this year.  As of press time the DOGE price was around 23 cents, down from the all-time high around 74 cents in May.  And the shiba inu coin – seen as a dogecoin clone, using the same Shiba inu dog breed as its mascot – is currently fetching around $0.00004845, down 45% from the all-time high of $0.00008854 on Oct. 28, based on data from TradingView.  Shiba coin price  In October SHIB surged 70% in a single 24-hour span to a reported market capitalization of over $39 billion. The price rise came as a petition circulated on the website Change.org seeking to get SHIB listed on the retail trading platform Robinhood.  Professional cryptocurrency analysts remain skeptical of SHIB.  McGlone, who in 2020 correctly predicted bitcoin’s ascent to over $50,000, wrote Wednesday that the SHIB token’s price might face a “reversion worthy of its parabolic rise.”  The Bloomberg analyst wrote that shiba inu tokens may be fun for speculators, having achieved a market capitalization of nearly $40 billion and a No. 9 October ranking on CoinMarketCap. But the dogecoin wannabe looks like an “example of excesses among 13,000 cryptos.”  He went on to say that the shiba inu coin presents a “unique blend of exploitation, good marketing, ESG, supply [versus] demand economics and gambling on an unprecedented 24/7 global scale, and faces reversion worthy of its parabolic rise.”  “The fact that the memecoin has reached our radar places shiba inu at similar risk as dogecoin in May, just before its collapse,” adds McGlone.  McGlone said that the combined market capitalization of dogecoin and shiba inu coin appear to repeatedly top out at $80 billion; it happened earlier this year during the run-up of April and May, and then again about a month ago.  Shiba inu crypto  In the report, McGlone contrasted the dog dynamic with the recent market support for bitcoin (BTC) around $60,000 and for ether (ETH) at around $4,000.  “Some cleansing of meme coins might pressure the stalwarts as a necessary part of the evolving, strengthening ecosystem,” he wrote.  Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics said the SHIB cryptocurrency has yet to prove itself.  “SHIB has gotten about as far as it can go on hype alone,” Greenspan said. ”Future value can only be derived from development of the network. For starters, they’ll need to get off the Ethereum platform and build their own blockchain, as well as other products.”  SHIB whale?  Earlier Wednesday a transaction record on the Ethereum blockchain showed a transfer of 170 billion SHIB coins, worth roughly $8 million.  The transaction drew the attention of the website Watcher.Guru, which characterized the transfers as a purchase made by a “whale,” which in crypto-industry jargon means an individual holdings a vast amounts of tokens.  A subsequent tweet of the item from the Watcher.Guru account got 864 retweets and 2,934 likes.  Earlier this week, the CEO of AMC Theatres said the movie-theater chain will accept shiba inu coins as payment through BitPay wallets in 60 to 120 days.  The developments, however, did little to rile up the SHIB market – letting the sleeping dog lie, as it were.  As of press time on Wednesday, SHIB was listless.

The victim was targeted by a SIM swap attack, in which scammers hijack accounts by manipulating cellular network employees to duplicate phone numbers so “threat actors” can intercept two-factor authorization requests, the police said .  Some of the stolen cryptocurrency was used by the teen to purchase an online username that the online gaming community considers rare. This suspicious transaction then led investigators to uncover the account holder of the username.

42410954,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtjw8,1637179289,"After Taproot, What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Future?","Taproot, a privacy and scalability upgrade Bitcoin developers have long been drooling over, finally activated last weekend. But more upgrades are in the pipeline, being worked on by developers behind the scenes.  Taproot is a particularly big upgrade in Bitcoin, called a “soft fork,” which isn’t executed all that often in Bitcoinland. Before Taproot, the last soft fork was SegWit, which activated on Bitcoin four years ago. Soft forks aren’t all that common. Nonetheless, they are an important type of upgrade that has repercussions for many projects building on top of Bitcoin, iteratively improving functionality of the open source digital currency.  Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Its Tech Stack  So, what could be next, after Taproot? In fact, developers have been eyeing many other important soft fork changes to Bitcoin over the years.  Though, as a quick aside, it’s worth mentioning that even though Taproot has now activated, the work for Taproot is far from over. To use Taproot transactions, Bitcoin wallets, exchanges and other services will need to upgrade to support them. Plus, many of the changes developers have been eyeing that rely on Taproot, still need to be made. But even if some exchanges and wallets have yet to adopt Taproot, some like BitGo and Blockstream Green have been speedier, and more than 50 percent of nodes supporting Bitcoin are running the upgraded software.  Still, for a long view of what’s in store for Bitcoin, let’s take a look at some of the other possible soft fork changes that are in the pipeline.  SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT  SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, described in detail in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 118, looks like someone is shouting gibberish at you via text. But the change is much less dramatic than it looks.  In short, it allows a new type of signing option when signing a transaction, allowing a user to sign a transaction without adding a specific output (which is the coins they want to send) – at least not right away. This code change helps with a variety of technical problems, including one facing the Lightning Network, the overlay network to Bitcoin that increases transaction scalability and speed, and decreases costs.  One of the pain points of the Lightning Network is needing to store up-to-date data. Similar to losing a bitcoin private key, if users lose this data they might not be able to get their funds back. Proposed Lightning Network revamp Eltoo could help to reduce the state storage, but it needs SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT to work properly.  “In a nutshell, this would get rid of the penalty based construction we use right now and reduce a lot of overhead for maintaining channel state as the state becomes symmetrical for all participants,” as Lightning Network researcher Rene Pickhardt put it in a StackExchange post.  The Lightning Network works as is. But SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT paves the way for Eltoo, which could make Lightning easier to use.  Covenants  Covenants are a proposed change to Bitcoin’s code that would restrict where a user can send their funds. For example, a covenant could restrict where the bitcoin can be sent, so that it can only go to a few whitelisted addresses.  Why would a user want to restrict the use of their funds? There are a number of reasons. One is security. Covenants make it easier to implement “vaults,” where users can still get their funds back even if a thief tries to run off with them. But that’s just one application. Covenants can also help with congestion control and channel factories, another proposed idea for further boosting scalability of the Lightning Network.  That’s the general idea behind covenants. There are at least a couple of proposals for covenants floating around, including OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (outlined in BIP 119) and OP_TAPLEAF_UPDATE_VERIFY, each of which takes a different technical approach.  Drivechains  “Sidechains” have long been a proposed feature to add to Bitcoin. They’re additional blockchains “pegged” to Bitcoin. These sidechains can have new and experimental technologies that Bitcoin doesn’t have yet – such as adding zk-SNARKs functionality similar to the privacy coin zcash, allowing users much more privacy than bitcoin offers. Users can effectively lock up their bitcoin in order to use the new type of coins in the sidechain.  In the past, sidechains have been called the “altcoin killer.” Because sidechains offer a way to add new, experimental technology to Bitcoin, they are supposed to make it less necessary to launch a new coin to test out new ideas.  Drivechains are a spin on this idea invented by researcher Paul Sztorc. In addition to writing up his proposed changes in BIPs 300 and 301, he and other developers have implemented a working version of the idea.  Drivechains are a more controversial proposal, though, because some developers argue they could hand miners (who secure bitcoin) more power. For this reason, Bitcoin developers told CoinDesk that they see drivechains as the least likely upgrade of the bunch.  Cross-input signature aggregation  Now that Taproot has gone through, cross-input signature aggregation (sometimes called just CISA) can be added on top of it.  Digital signatures are a crucial piece of Bitcoin. When a user wants to send some bitcoin, they must use their private key to “sign” coins, proving that they own their bitcoins, allowing them to send the bitcoins to someone else. Taproot introduces Schnorr signatures, which allow for multiple signatures to be combined into one, making transactions a bit less expensive and boosting scalability.  On top of this, CISA proposes allowing signatures in a single transaction to be aggregated. One of the exciting consequences of CISA is that it can make CoinJoins cheaper. Using wallets like Wasabi and Samourai, CoinJoins are a method of boosting a user’s privacy by combining a number of user’s coins together into one transaction and “mixing” them, so that it is difficult to tell where any of the coins came from.  Right now, CoinJoins are cumbersome and they’re more expensive than normal transactions. But with CISA, they could be much cheaper. All of the signatures in the transaction can be mashed together, reducing the cost of the CoinJoin transaction.  “Instead of paying for the privilege of better privacy, you would be saving money to get better privacy. This will be particularly true of exchanges, where a lot of these transactions take place. They will want to [CoinJoin] exiting customer transactions with lots of other transactions to save money, and the side-effect will be more privacy for the rest of that transaction!” as Jimmy Song put it in his Bitcoin Tech Talk newsletter.  Only time will tell if any of these proposals will make it into Bitcoin. Once more concrete proposals are put forth, it will be up to the community to decide if they are good changes worth pursuing – or not.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | FORKS,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/17/after-taproot-whats-next-for-bitcoins-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3b0086730a0c4ccd7a3ac255c827102fa66877d-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411638,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLp3,1637178797,"FTX, Crypto.com and the ‘Stadium Curse’","News broke Wednesday that Los Angeles’ Staples Center, longtime home to the National Basketball Association dominating L.A. Lakers team, will be renamed “Crypto.com Arena” in a 20-year, $700 million naming rights deal that appears to be the largest in sports history. While plenty of sports fans seem to be mourning the end of an era, others see the name change as a legitimation of the crypto sector as a whole.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I would love for that to prove out, but the history of naming-rights deals for major stadiums shows there’s no guarantee. Plenty of companies, particularly companies leaning on new technologies or speculative investments, have gone belly-up after what seemed like victory-lap naming deals. For a time this was so common that people referred to “the stadium curse.” Big spending on naming rights has sometimes even been cited as a reason for investors to question the judgment of company management because the pay-off in branding and publicity remains somewhat unclear.  The “stadium curse” has hit some companies you know and many you don’t. The farkakteh “energy-trading company” Enron, perhaps the most notorious corporate fraud of the past half-century, went belly up just two years after buying the rights to the Houston Astros baseball team’s stadium (now Minute Maid Park). CMGI, an internet investment and holding company, didn’t last much longer after a 1999 naming deal for the U.S. football New England Patriots’ field, now known as Gillette Stadium.  These cases illustrate the fundamental tension at the heart of naming deals. They’re the corporate equivalent of buying a Lamborghini: functionally almost useless, but a huge signal to the world that you’re winning, exactly because you’ve got so much money to set on fire. Much in the way that day-trading gurus flaunt (rented) Lambos, this makes the success signal of a stadium name particularly attractive for companies that haven’t actually “made it” yet.  It’s particularly tempting to apply this rubric to the Crypto.com deal because the exchange has relatively thin brand recognition. It spends a ton on advertising and does decent volume, ranking fourth worldwide among spot markets, according to CoinGecko data. But in contrast to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, which recently bought naming rights to the venue of another U.S. pro basketball team, the Miami Heat, Crypto.com isn’t deeply involved in crypto innovation. Maybe the rise of a purely retail-focused operation is itself an index of sector-wide growth, but at a high level you could see it being particularly vulnerable to a downturn in crypto markets.  (Incidentally, FTX reportedly paid just $135 million for 19 years of naming rights, and the Heat is nearly as hot as the Lakers these days. It seems either FTX got a great deal or Crypto.com got soaked – or maybe this prices in the likelihood that Miami will be underwater in 20 years.)  Read more:Crypto.com Looks to Cash In on Bull Market With $100M Advertising Campaign  Beyond Enron and CMGI, there’s a bit of a “curse” angle to the Staples Center name change itself. The name has become iconic, thanks largely to the legendary championship runs of the Kobe Bryant-led L.A. Lakers circa 2008-2012. In fact, “Staples Center” is probably just as recognizable these days as the actual company Staples, which is still a large retailer but has been shrinking steadily in the era of Amazon.  Bryant’s widow, for instance, seemed unsettled by the name change, and took to Instagram for an oblique complaint.     Vanessa Bryant’s point may be that what players do is always more important than who cuts a big check for naming rights. But Lakers fans are definitely mourning the loss of the “Staples Center” name, which has come to represent a powerful legacy. That demonstrates just how valuable sports naming rights can be: Given a bit of luck, it can lead people to associate your brand with some of the most admired people on Earth.  Read more: Crypto Has a Marketing Issue | The Node  That might not be enough by itself to supercharge a business. But you know who hasn’t had a stadium in Los Angeles named after it for the past 20 years? Office Depot, which Staples has outperformed and is trying to buy. Maybe a coincidence – but it does turn out that the bulk of “stadium curse” cases were clustered around the dot-com bust, and naming rights have been a bit more of a mixed bag for investors since then.  However optimistic you might be about crypto, the current wave of rapid and speculative growth definitely rhymes with the conditions in the tech industry in the late 1990s when Enron and similar naming deals were inked. Whatever the fate of Crypto.com itself, we’ll likely see some reckonings as currently hot crypto operations turn out to be overleveraged bets a la CMGI or outright frauds a la Enron.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

Third Point, Marshall Wallace, Coinbase Ventures, HSBC and other investors participated in this latest round. CoinDesk reported last month that the company was digging for nine-figure funding at a $3 billion valuation.  Brooklyn, New York-based ConsenSys is already a force to be reckoned with in the Ethereum ecosystem. It develops hyper-popular crypto wallet MetaMask and manages a handful of developer toolkits, including blockchain application programming interface (API) suite Infura and Truffle, for smart contract development.  All three have seen their bases soar in tandem with the Ethereum ecosystem’s staggering growth this year. MetaMask now has 21 million users, Infura 350,000 developers and Truffle, which ConsenSys acquired last November, 4.7 million.  Toss in an active protocol engineering unit and a sandbox for companies and even central banks that want to build on blockchain, and what emerges is Ethereum’s most influential corporate backer.  Read more: ConsenSys Holds Funding Round Talks With $3B Valuation  “This round announcement is validation that we chose the right pieces” during the April restructuring that narrowed ConsenSys’ focus to its products and put less emphasis on consulting, Morris told CoinDesk.  Keeping MetaMask and Infura – Morris called them “innovation engines” – helps ConsenSys maintain a constant if behind-the-scenes presence in the Ethereum world.  “We don’t have to sit here and say what’s the next big DeFi thing or what’s the next big NFT thing, we’re there for all of it,” Morris said.

Morris attributed the service’s success to its best execution capability, which he said trawls multiple decentralized exchanges. It also benefits from ConsenSys’ Ethereum tech prowess, he said.  “When people submit transactions we can intervene and make minor tweaks to make it more likely to succeed,” Morris explained. “We know from the point that you press the ‘go’ button, that we can get done what you want to get done.”  “ConsenSys’ MetaMask wallet and other tools offer a unique platform for consumers, enterprises and developers to engage, build and create on the decentralized web,” Third Point’s Daniel Loeb said in a statement.

42424254,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2mKhh,1637178558,India to Ban Crypto as Payment Method but Regulate as Asset: Report,"India will ban the use of cryptocurrencies for making payments, but will allow and regulate trading of crypto as assets, the Economic Times reported citing government sources.  The government plans to present a crypto regulation bill in the parliament’s winter session, details of which are being finalized. The bill appears to have changed course from the earlier plans to ban crypto in the country.  In the bill, authorities will also ban “active solicitation” from crypto firms, including exchanges and platforms, ET reported.  The issue of advertising has triggered a “big debate,” with some thinking that ads mislead youth, Tanvi Ratna, founder and CEO of think tank Policy 4.0 told CoinDesk.  Crypto exchanges WazirX and Bitbins have paused their ads, ET also reported. A WazirX spokesperson told CoinDesk that the exchange stopped advertising in August, adding that ET’s headline is misleading, while CoinDCX declined to comment on the report.  The government held a meeting with crypto industry representatives on Monday, adding onto a series of closed-doors discussions between government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that have taken place in the last few days.  “Regulating crypto as an asset doesn’t solve all the issues that authorities are concerned about, but it does take it out of the currency arena, which is one of RBI’s worries,“ Ratna said.  “The trickiest part is defining the asset class,” she said, adding that current discussions to regulate crypto as a commodity are not a good fit. But other RBI concerns are more challenging to solve, such as financial stability, capital controls, and exchange rate risk, Ratna noted.  Price arbitrage has emerged as a new worry, ET also reported on Wednesday, citing anonymous sources. Authorities are concerned about how any regulator could keep tabs on multiple exchanges “when there is a huge price difference and an opportunity for a price arbitrage,” according to one of the sources.  The exchanges are pushing for a regulatory sandbox to fine-tune the regulations, according to the report. The Securities and Exchange Board of India could be designated as the regulator, but no “final call” has been taken on this issue, the report added.

The company’s valuation was not disclosed.  “On existing social networks, user identity and content are platform commodities. Data moats and targeted advertising services lead to misaligned incentives between platforms and the people using them. No one owns the information they share, yet users’ data is remixed by algorithms on centralized platforms that farm and profit from their attention,” Mem co-founder and CEO Abhi Vyas wrote in the announcement blog post.  Founded earlier this year, Mem aims to solve that problem by building a decentralized social media protocol centered around what the company calls “data sovereignty.” The protocol creates a standardized data specification and common set of operators to give individuals control over the collection of their personal information. Developers can embed Mem into their applications to provide a more personalized experience across the web, essentially operating as a user-driven, transparent alternative to web tracking.  Mem was created on Substrate, the custom blockchain builder, with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. The company is currently in limited testing with plans to launch its protocol in early 2022.  “Some of the core attributes of Web 3 – such as openness, decentralization and user control – are perfectly suited for a new type of social networking platform that’s optimized around the user.

The 0.6% tax on bank credits and debits currently applies only to certain banking transactions carried out by companies operating in Argentina.  Until now, crypto exchanges did not pay taxes because they were part of an exemption that applies to fintech companies registered as payment service providers (PSP).  The tax will affect crypto exchanges that hold accounts in Argentine banks, an Argentinian exchange senior executive told CoinDesk, adding that the prices of cryptocurrencies in Argentine pesos are likely to increase as companies transfer the new cost to customers.  Cafecito founder Damian Catanzaro, an Argentine entrepreneur who recently connected Lightning Network to the tipping platform, said that after the tax, crypto users will increasingly opt for peer-to-peer exchange platforms and non-custodial wallets.  Argentina’s Tax Policy Secretary, Roberto Arias, said on Twitter that the measure is not a tax on cryptocurrencies, adding that the decree will “provide greater certainty” on the operations of crypto exchanges.  In September, Argentina’s Central Bank President, Miguel Pesce, said the bank was watching the development of cryptocurrencies with “concern.” In June, it began an investigation of nine fintech companies for allegedly offering unauthorized financial intermediation through cryptoassets.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/17/argentina-to-tax-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51634166c6f1dc316be6de8f87e0dd0cb2babe30-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Massive 2.2M ETH Exited Exchanges In The Last Three Days Alone As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, on-chain data shows around $9 billion in Ethereum was taken off exchanges in the past few days. The indicator of relevance here is the &apos;exchange reserve,&apos; which measures the total amount of ETH present in exchange wallets. When this metric&apos;s value goes down, it means investors are withdrawing their Ethereum from exchanges. Such a trend may be a sign of accumulation, and could be bullish in the long-term. On the other hand, when the indicator moves up, it implies holders are moving their coins to exchanges either for withdrawing to fiat or for purchasing altcoins. This situation can end up being bearish for the crypto. Now, here is a chart that highlights the trend in the value of the Ethereum exchange reserve over the past year: Looks like the indicator has been dropping off for a while | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph shows, the Ethereum exchange reserves showed a very sharp decline over the past three days.

The head of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange also said he doesn’t “get” dogecoin.  “Personally, I’m financially free. I don’t need a lot of money and I can maintain my lifestyle in this way. I do intend to give away most of my wealth, like many wealthy entrepreneurs or founders did, from [John D.] Rockefeller until today. I do intend to give away 90, 95 or 99% of my wealth,” Zhao said.  Zhao said he doesn’t do much personal investing. He purchased some bitcoins in 2014 and said he has held on to most of that stake. He said the majority of his net worth is in the form of BNB (Binance coin) and that he doesn’t personally own equity in any other projects, crypto or non-crypto, to avoid potential conflicts of interest.  Forbes has estimated Zhao’s wealth at $1.9 billion, but he is likely worth significantly more given that he is Binance’s largest shareholder. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that former Binance executives think the company could be worth as much as $300 billion if it were to go public.  Asked for his takeaway on cryptos that started as a joke but soared in value, Zhao said “to be honest, I don’t get dogecoin.” But he added that “this shows the power of decentralization. What I think may or may not matter. If a large enough number of people in the community values it because it’s cute, because they like the meme, then it has value,” he continued.  Zhao also said he thinks the largest factor hindering the growth of crypto is ease of use and not its oft-cited volatility. “[Centralized exchanges] hold custody of people’s coins. (But) how to securely hold your tokens is a fundamental limitation factor. We have not provided easy-enough-to-use tools that are also secure enough today.

The funds will help advance the Anoma protocol, a proof-of-stake blockchain that allows traders to conduct private, asset-agnostic transactions.  Polychain Capital led the round with participation from Electric Capital, Zola Global, CMCC, Maven 11 Capital and Fifth Era, among others.  The Anoma Foundation previously raised six million Swiss francs ($6.75 million) in a January funding round that was also led by Polychain.  “We didn’t raise from random people for a reason. It wasn’t so much about the capital. It’s also about getting competent people closer involved in Anoma,” Anoma co-founder Adrian Brink told CoinDesk.  The Anoma protocol is a layer one, or base, blockchain that helps traders securely move and convert assets without needing a base currency. For example, if someone wanted to pay a friend in bitcoin but the friend wanted to receive ether, the Anoma protocol would automate the exchange at the best market rate.  Anoma launched its first test network, or testnet, earlier this month, the first milestone in its public testnet roadmap.  “The next couple of months are very much going to focus on testnet and releasing the testnets in a successive fashion with more and more features added to them so that the general public can start playing with them,” said Brink.  Anoma will also work to scale out the user interface teams to start building out wallets and integrations, said Brink.  Anoma was co-founded by Brink, Awa Sun Yin and Christopher Goes, who met while working at blockchain technology firm All in Bits, also known as Tendermint, the company that built the Cosmos Network.

42376289,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4Op,1637166860,Web 3 Social Media Needs Dedicated Blockchains,"Many believe that general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum, Cardano, Avalanche and Solana will come to power everything on the web, including financial apps, social apps and even Amazon-like marketplaces. But there’s a show-stopping problem that’s being widely overlooked: on-chain storage.  While today’s general-purpose blockchains have worked well for storage-light applications like decentralized finance (DeFi), they cannot scale to handle storage-heavy applications like social apps and marketplaces. Imagine a world in which every “like” or follow on a decentralized app cost $1.00+ in storage fees.  Unfortunately, that reality is now because of the storage limitations of all general-purpose blockchains on the market today. As such, in order for Web 3 to reach its full potential to disrupt Web 2 and the systems of the past, new blockchain architectures will be required.  Nader Al-Naji is head of the DeSo Foundation and founder of social media platform BitClout.  From finite state to infinite state  Today, all general-purpose blockchains on the market were built to power what we call finite state applications. These are applications where the amount of data or state that you have to keep on-hand for each user is, well, finite. For example, in order to build a financial app, all you really need to know in order to validate transactions is each user’s account balance.  Users could transfer funds between each other millions of times, but at the end all you need to store is just a few numbers indicating the final balance of each user. Put another way, the state you have to keep around grows as a function of the number of users rather than as a function of the number of transactions.  Perhaps surprisingly, virtually all DeFi consists of finite state applications.  What if we want to look beyond finance? Infinite state applications are ones where the amount of data you need to store grows indefinitely with the number of actions that each user performs. For example, consider a typical social app: Users can create a profile, make a post, follow people and do other such things, all of which add state.  The difference is that, with social applications all transactions are state-augmenting rather than state-neutral, as is the case with DeFi. With social, instead of just having to keep a few account balances in your state, you need to be able to store an indefinite amount of data. Even worse, this state needs to be frequently queried by other users on the network, requiring it to be highly available.  In order to handle the storage and indexing requirements inherent to infinite state applications, blockchains will need to be custom-tailored to the application at hand, such as DeSo for decentralized social. This is because, without being able to make assumptions about the type of data that will be stored, the costs of storing, indexing and querying the data will skyrocket, making applications built on the chain uncompetitive.  An unsustainable expense  The cost of storing just 1 gigabyte of on-chain state varies significantly across blockchains. Importantly, these costs are only expected to increase for general-purpose blockchains because they weren’t designed to scale storage.  These high on-chain storage costs prevent the vast majority of Web 2 applications from being implementable on today’s general-purpose blockchains, even when using bridges to storage-focused blockchains like Arweave or Filecoin. At current prices, even storing a simple link to Arweave or Filecoin on a general-purpose chain costs $0.10-$1.00+, which is prohibitively expensive.  Moreover, even though many blockchains claim to be able to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), this metric does not take into account the storage properties of the application at hand. There is a big difference between 50,000 DeFi transactions, which may generate zero bytes of new state data, as opposed to 50,000 social transactions, which may generate tens of megabytes that need to be stored, indexed and queried.  Today’s most advanced blockchains fail completely at handling the latter type of transaction. This limitation is blocking the development of some of the most interesting Web 3 applications.  Read more: Web 3 Is Where the Young People Are  We at the DeSo Foundation been researching this challenge and have concluded that all storage-heavy Web 3 applications, such as social apps and marketplaces, will require new types of blockchains to develop because these applications are infinite state applications rather than finite state applications.  The difficulty of storing and indexing data in a scalable way is something that has been underestimated by most of the crypto space. For a long time, the entire space has been limited to finite state applications without much consideration for the wide range of infinite state applications, like social apps and marketplaces, that make up the majority of Web 2 applications.  In order for Web 3 to reach its full potential to disrupt Web 2 and the systems of the past, blockchains that are custom-built to support new use cases will be required because of the storage and indexing limitations inherent to the existing general-purpose chains.",NEUTRAL,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIL | MARKET | AR,Nader \Diamondhands\ Al-Naji,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/17/web-3-social-media-needs-dedicated-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bbd6c2c07bb0644da4f95b6da9a83fc0c62d54d-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375844,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBps9,1637165174,"Avalanche’s AVAX Token Surges to All-Time High After Deloitte Deal, Defying Crypto Trend","Smart-contracts platform Avalanche’s AVAX token hit a new all-time high Wednesday and is up 20% on the week, even as bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, has suffered a pullback.  Avalanche is an Ethereum competitor that facilitates decentralized applications (dapps) and the creation of custom blockchains on its ecosystem. Launched by Ava Labs in 2020, Avalanche’s native AVAX token has a capped supply of 720 million and is used as part of the consensus mechanism and for paying network fees.  AVAX has soared in price recently, trading at $104.21, up 85% in the last month alone. The gains pushed the token’s market capitalization to about $23 billion, vaulting past Terra’s LUNA token to become the fifth-largest among Ethereum competitors, or so-called layer 1 (base layer) alternatives.  “Avax has seen significant growth in the past two months consistent with the rest of the layer 1 market,” said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer of Stack Funds. “We expect that AVAX will continue to head north in the near term while demand for layer 1s is still high.”  Avalanche founder and Ava Labs CEO Emin Gun Sirer said Tuesday his company will be partnering with “Big Four” accounting firm Deloitte “to build more efficient disaster relief platforms using the Avalanche blockchain.”  Some analysts say the announcement may have propelled the latest leg up in the AVAX coin price.  Avalanche incentive programs  Avalanche has announced more than $600 million of initiatives recently to spur growth on the network. In September, the Avalanche Foundation announced a $230 million raise to jump-start liquidity in the network’s burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Then, in earlyNovember, Avalanche developers and investors formed a $200 million Blizzard Investment Fund. There’s also Avalanche Rush, a $180 million liquidity mining incentive fund.  Dibb said the new efforts have spurred “a large transition of projects and applications to move from Ethereum over to Avalanche.”  “Avalanche has received positive news coverage over its new $200 million funding for its DeFi platform and this new Deloitte partnership,” Freddie Evans, sales trader at digital-asset broker GlobalBlock, said in emailed comments.  Juan Pellicer, analyst at IntoTheBlock, said he was “excited to see how Avalanche continues to grow its DeFi ecosystem, for example by launching liquid staking products,” such as allowing users to stake their crypto in one pool and use their staked assets to farm yields in a liquidity provider pool or vice versa, “will allow investors and traders to be more capital efficient while helping secure the network in a decentralized manner.“  “This could possibly be a catalyst for the demand of AVAX,” he said.  AVAX price versus ETH price  Ethereum (ETH) is down 8.4% on the week, trading near $4,245 at press time.  Avalanche’s price gains also appeared to diverge from other layer 1 tokens. Solana’s SOL is down 5.6% on the week, Polkadot’s DOT has slid 10% and Cardano’s ADA is off just over 10%.  Grayscale Investments, owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk, announced earlier this month that it was considering adding Avalanche to its range of investment products.",POSITIVE,AVAX | ETH,AVAX | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/17/avalanches-avax-token-surges-to-all-time-high-after-deloitte-deal-defying-crypto-trend,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65a4ddb39c106628ad7b1b43b83c3902823ff567-1973x1481.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Laboure noted that the Bitcoin network can process up to seven transactions per second, or 600,000 per day, while payment giant Visa can handle up to 24,000 transactions per second, or over two billion transactions per day.  In this respect, The Lightning Network, which aims to improve Bitcoin’s scalability by boosting speed and lowering costs, could be promising, Laboure wrote. Lightning Network claims it can process 25 million transactions per second at a cost of four cents per transaction, implying that it is a thousand times faster than Visa at processing payments and with lower fees, Deutsche wrote. But Visa and Mastercard currently post transaction volumes that dwarf those of the Lightning Network.  “Even if the Lightning Network exceeds $100 billion a year in transaction volume by 2025, that will still be less than 1% of the value of Visa’s annual payment transactions,” Laboure wrote.  Bitcoin becoming more accepted and used as a payment method will require “significant regulatory involvement,” Laboure added.  The Taproot upgrade helps improve some of Bitcoin’s scalability issues, Deutsche Bank said, but Laboure still sees third-party developer initiatives such as the Lightning Network playing a larger role for Bitcoin’s adoption as a payment method going forward.  Payment services provider Square said on its website this week that all Cash App customers should be able to send bitcoin to Taproot-enabled wallets by Dec. 1 as the company seeks to confirm its activation is working properly. The company added the Taproot upgrade should help Cash App customers with increased privacy features, lower transaction fees and better smart contracts.

Most recently, bitcoin miner Bit Digital said Wednesday it has moved all of its mining rigs to North America.  “Our mining assets are now entirely out of China and 100% in North America,” said Bit Digital’s CEO Bryan Bullett in a statement. “We believe the shift in global hash distribution will result in a stronger bitcoin network, with the majority of hash now located here in North America,” he added.  In fact, according to a Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance study published in October, the U.S. accounted for about 35% of the total bitcoin mining hashrate, or computing power, while Canada contributed almost 10%, setting up North America as the dominant region for bitcoin mining following China’s moves.  Bit Digital said it owned 27,744 mining rigs with a total hashrate of 1.6 exahash per second (EH/S), as of Sept. 30. This was a decline from 32,500 miners and 1.915 EH/s of mining power as of June 30 because it sold and disposed of some of its mining computers during the migration.  However, the miner said the majority of its recently closed $80 million equity placement was used to buy 10,000 new Bitmain miners. Most of these new computers have been installed and the rest will be online through June 2022, raising the miner’s computing power to about 2.6 EH/s.  The current hashrate of the total Bitcoin network is about 133 EH/s as of Oct. 16, according to data analytics firm Glassnode.

The Oasis Foundation announced Tuesday the launch of the fund in collaboration with a host of major venture capital firms, including Dragonfly Capital Partners, Draper Dragon Fund, Electric Capital, FBG, Jump Capital, Kenetic Capital, NGC Ventures and Pantera Capital, according to a press release.  The fund will be used to seed early stage projects building on Oasis, including “DeFi, NFTs [non-fungible tokens], metaverse, data tokenization, data DAO, data governance” and other projects.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Oasis Labs founder Dawn Song said there is already a deal-flow pipeline of young projects ready for announcement.  “The hope is that everyone works together to fuel the growth of the ecosystem,” she said.  The fund bears similarity to a program established by Avalanche last month, Blizzard, where a group of VC investors committed $200 million to early stage projects. Both programs are part of a wider trend of layer 1s committing massive sums of money to bootstrapping projects and traffic in an increasingly competitive landscape for Ethereum base layer alternatives.

However, Song told CoinDesk that the chain may be preparing for prime time. The chain hosts “ParaTimes” – essentially sidechains with different execution environments that collectively rely on the same consensus layer – and a forthcoming ParaTime, “Emerald,” will enable Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) projects to easily port over to the chain.  Song said that the launch of Emerald is “imminent,” that a host of recognizable DeFi names are already building implementations on the network and that the launch of Emerald may come with a ROSE token liquidity mining program as well.  “There is a DEX [decentralized exchange], there’s lending, NFT projects, including special types of NFTs, there are lots of exciting partnerships coming,” she said.",POSITIVE,FTM,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | FTM | SPONSORED,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/17/oasis-launches-160m-ecosystem-fund-with-backing-from-jump-capital-and-others,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/baa2642e1977ac91726ea5a6afefff43fb59fcdc-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410967,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtkWV,1637152200,"‘Ethereum Killers’ Are Helpful, Not Harmful","Since the launch of initial coin offerings (ICOs) like EOS and Tezos, a steady stream of alternative smart contract platforms have been labeled “Ethereum killers,” immediately pitting them against one another.  During 2021, which has arguably been the biggest year of adoption among these alternative layer 1 protocols, the success of Solana, Avalanche and others has not necessarily come at the expense of Ethereum. In fact, the ecosystems are thriving in parallel with applications deploying on all chains.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Chain-specific total value locked (TVL) is just one measure for DeFi demand, and the most prominent chains have all seen growth rather than competition between one another. At the very beginning of 2021, Ethereum had $21 billion locked in DeFi, accounting for 97% of the multi-chain ecosystem. Fast forward to June 1, and Ethereum’s DeFi TVL grew to $85.6 billion but only represented 73.2% of the overall ecosystem as Polygon and Binance Smart Chain took market share.  Today, Ethereum has $180 billion in DeFi TVL, but its dominance has fallen still further to 66.5%. I would argue that the dominance number is less important in the short term, as Ethereum looks to scale tremendously with the help of Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and more. The idea that these other chains are “Ethereum killers” appears to be false, as Ethereum TVL grew almost 9x, while its native token only grew 5.9x.  In the same timespan, Avalanche’s AVAX has grown 25x and Solana’s SOL has grown 148x, helping account for a significant portion of the capital in both ecosystems. Furthermore, Avalanche, Fantom and other chains have used their native tokens to increase DeFi yield and incentivize immediate TVL growth, a move that is relatively impossible for Ethereum and layer 2s to compete with in the coming months.  Capital on Ethereum has been relatively sticky over the last several years, and I think that will ring more true as we end the bull cycle and certain ecosystems lose momentum.  Two scenarios could likely “choose winners” out of the current landscape, including:  A sustained bear market takes hold as incentive programs run dry and non-innovative projects die out.  Failures of centralization are highlighted through censorship, regulation or hardware costs.  All this said, I think experimentation with new ecosystems and new technology has been very positive for crypto overall. Encouraging competition will ultimately deliver better solutions to the end users in the long run. In the short run, we have been able to onboard hundreds of thousands of users into crypto who would have been priced out of Ethereum’s base layer.  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.

Validated takes  Barbados is working with several “metaverse” companies to establish sovereign land in the digital world. BACKGROUND: Small countries and large corporations have been outspoken in their support of the metaverse, looking to take advantage of being early entrants. Barbados believes that the technology will be a gateway for cultural diplomacy and trade.  An 8,000-member DAO committed over $3 million to buy a copy of the United States Constitution. BACKGROUND: The idea to buy an original copy of the Constitution stemmed from 10 crypto natives but grew like a wildfire across the industry, with several notable builders, investors and community members joining. The adoption of DAOs has gained popularity by like-minded individuals to crowdsource talent and work toward common goals.  Paraswap’s Sybil-resistant airdrop outraged past users and the broader crypto community. BACKGROUND: The decentralized exchange router had been hinting at an airdrop for several months before it went live last week. A tough approach to distinguish real users from airdrop hunters and the use of only 7.5% of the supply left many real users of Paraswap on the sidelines.  The anticipated launch of Rocket Pool was met with demand for decentralized staking. BACKGROUND: In one week, Rocket Pool gathered 3,040 ETH deposits and is running 327 node operators. However, the staking pool will likely only attract stakers most adamant about decentralization, as other staking protocols already have millions of ETH secured.

The ECB also warned against the growing link between stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are pegged to fiat currencies, and the traditional financial market.

The RBI’s anti-crypto stance is well known by now. The central bank had bannedall regulated lenders from holding or facilitating cryptocurrency transactions in April 2018. However, the decision was set aside by the Supreme Court of India in March 2020.  Das’ latest comments come on the heels of the Indian government’s assurances to take progressive and forward-looking steps on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Das had also said earlier that the number of Indians reported to be investing in crypto could be “exaggerated.”  The Indian government is looking to ban the use of crypto as a payment method, but will allow and regulate trading of crypto as assets, according to a report.  The government may table a crypto regulation bill in the upcoming winter session of the parliament, scheduled to start from Nov. 29 and end around Dec. 23.

However, past data shows pullbacks or downtrends typically end when social chatter leans bearish.  Data tracked by blockchain analytics platform Santiment shows “buy the dip” mentions on social media rose to 952 on Tuesday, hitting the highest levels since Sept. 7, when bitcoin crashed by 11%. The number of mentions remains elevated at press time.  It may be a sign that bitcoin has yet to find a bottom. “Just look at the previous spikes in the ‘buy the dip’ calls and you’ll notice that they’ve often come early (like back in April and May, respectively) and tend to be accompanied by another leg down before the crowd is finally proven right,” Santiment said in its market update on Wednesday.  While “buy the dip” chatter on social media surged after the Sept. 7 slide to $43,000, the cryptocurrency bottomed out below $40,000 two weeks later. A similar pattern was seen several times in May and June.  If history is a guide, bitcoin is unlikely to chart a recovery to recent highs near $69,000. The U.S. dollar’s ongoing rally and renewed uncertainty about crypto taxation in the U.S. may keep bitcoin buyers at bay for some time.

42411145,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7kYN,1637120995,Kleiman v. Wright Trial: Craig Wright’s Flinty 4-Day Testimony Comes to an End,"MIAMI — On Monday, Craig Wright, wearing a cream-colored suit and purple tie, concluded his fourth day of testimony in the civil suit launched against him by the estate of his former best friend and alleged business partner, David Kleiman.  Ira Kleiman, David’s brother, and the attorneys representing the estate posit that David and Wright worked together to “invent” Bitcoin and mine a hoard of over 1.1 million coins, worth over $60 billion today. They also accuse Wright of stealing David’s share of the intellectual property rights and profits through a series of legal maneuvers and forgeries after David’s death in 2013.  In court, Wright said that he’d written the famous white paper alone and asked David Kleiman for help cleaning it up.  “If it had been a 60-page paper full of academic wankery, no one would read it.”  Plaintiffs say the two men were partners in a company called W&K Info Defense Research, LLC, which they used to mine and “develop” Bitcoin together. But Wright says he was never involved in W&K, and that it was a venture between his ex-wife Lynn Wright and David Kleiman.  Read more: Kleiman v. Wright: Bitcoin’s Trial of the Century Kicks Off in Miami  Nevertheless, after David’s death, Wright said he offered Ira Kleiman $12 million of his own money at one point to take on a director role at one of his companies. But Kleiman had refused the offer. Wright claimed Ira Kleiman would have been paid $30,000 per month for about 30 hours of work.  “That’s more than most people ever imagine, more than most people on this earth would dream about, and he turned it down,” Wright said. Instead of helping run a company, Ira “wanted to strip it, loot it, take it, basically eviscerate it so he could sit there drinking mai tais and not actually working,” Wright said.  Wright said in Monday’s testimony that he grew up with a single mother working three jobs, values hard work and won’t give handouts.  Freedman, one of the attorneys for the plaintiff, introduced documents purporting to show that Wright had “looted the company of all the intellectual property” to ice out Ira Kleiman.  “There was no looting,” Wright retorted. W&K owned, and still owns, software rights, which Ira Kleiman could exploit if he had the know-how, got investors and hired people, Wright said. “He doesn’t know what to do.”  Wright contrasted that with his own claims of technical and financial know-how.  “On a good day, I have written the equivalent of a master’s thesis,” Wright said. “I’m enrolled in 19 different universities; one of them is Harvard. … I actually wrote three papers last night.”  Freedman tried to show Wright contradicting himself. At one point he asked whether Dave Kleiman had mined bitcoin in 2009. On the stand, Wright said no, because Dave was in the hospital at that time. Freedman showed a Slack message in which Wright said Dave had mined it. At every such turn, Wright attempted to explain away discrepancies, suggesting that Kleiman’s legal team was misunderstanding or intentionally distorting the context.  Casting doubt  Monday’s testimony capped Wright’s appearance on the stand, which began last week. Throughout it, Freedman focused his attack on Wright’s alleged history of theft, forgery and deceit.  For example, on Nov. 9, through a series of emails between Wright and others, including Ira Kleiman and Wright’s associates, Freedman attempted to paint a picture of Wright and David Kleiman’s history of partnership, and Wright’s subsequent scramble to sweep it under the rug after David’s death, ostensibly because he realized he could keep Satoshi’s crown – and what the plaintiffs are calling “Satoshi’s hoard” of bitcoins – for himself.  Wright, who is known for his combative nature, was unyielding on the stand. Despite being presented with piece after piece of evidence that contradicted his explanation of events, Wright attempted to explain them away with claims that he had been hacked, that he had been misunderstood (which the defense has blamed on Wright’s autism) or that he’d simply been exaggerating David Kleiman’s role in the “creation” of bitcoin to give his dead friend a “legacy.”  Read more: In Craig Wright Trial, Plaintiffs Lay Out Pattern of Fraud, Deceit and Hubris  Though Wright has repeatedly failed to prove that he controls the bitcoins associated with Satoshi Nakamoto – and several experts have cast doubt on the existence of some of the bitcoins in question entirely – Wright’s notoriety means the case is being watched closely by many in the crypto community.  What does a partnership entail?  Importantly, it is the alleged partnership between David Kleiman and Wright – not the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto – that is at the heart of this civil trial.  Last week, attorneys for the plaintiffs showed the jury dozens of emails between Wright and Ira Kleiman in 2014 where Wright refers to David as his business partner, as well as messages between Wright and other associates including an Australian software salesman named Mark Ferrier and a former business associate, Robert MacGregor, where Wright calls David his business partner.  While he was on the stand, Wright frequently defended against the implications contained within these emails by claiming that he meant something different by “partner” than what Kleiman and his attorneys understood the word to mean. His defense has pointed to his diagnosis with autism to explain his purported tendency to be overly literal and difficult to understand.  Wright also claimed that he exaggerated his claims in emails to David Kleiman’s family and colleagues to build a “legacy” for his friend.  “I exaggerated because Dave had no one remembering him, and he was the most important person in my life for many years,” Wright tearfully told the jury on Nov. 9.  Wright also claimed that several other emails referring to David Kleiman as his business partner were either falsified by an unknown hacker or written by wayward staff at one of his numerous companies with access to his email accounts.  Wright said his staff often “took dictation” from him as well as transcribed his handwritten notes for emails and blog posts. During his testimony last week, Wright insinuated that one of them could have added incorrect details about his and David Kleiman’s alleged partnership.  Issues with the Australian Tax Office  Wright also pointed the finger at “hackers” when asked to explain why, in numerous documents from the Australian Tax Office (ATO) – ranging from emails to contracts to transcripts of conversations with government officials – he referred to David Kleiman as his business partner.  When asked specifically about a transcript of a conversation on Aug. 11, 2014, involving Wright, his attorney and the ATO, Wright refused to authenticate the document.  “That never happened,” Wright said of the 40-plus page government transcript provided by the ATO.  Wright told the jury the ATO had been hacked and accused the officials investigating him in 2014 of forging documents to further a “witch hunt” against him in an attempt to squash his company, Coin-Exch. He also claimed the lead ATO official on the case, Andrew Miller, had been fired, and that Miller’s colleague Dave McMaster had also been fired, “or at least sent to Papua New Guinea, which is about the worst place you can be sent in Australia.”  Freedman asked Wright why, if his claims were true, he had been unable to provide any proof the ATO had taken disciplinary actions against the investigators and dropped the charges against him.  Wright simply stated that he had provided proof, which Freedman denied.  A complex web of shell companies emerges  Wright’s troubles with the ATO began in 2014, after he sued W&K for its contents, including intellectual property, which was then transferred to a company controlled by Wright.  During Wright’s four days on the stand, a complex web of companies and shell companies with convoluted ownership structures was revealed, making it difficult to follow the trail of money, bitcoins and intellectual property as they traveled from company to company as reported to the Australian tax authorities.  Freedman showed Wright numerous documents that listed Wright as a director, a representative and a shareholder of W&K while Wright steadfastly maintained that he was never any of those things. Instead, he insisted that W&K was a partnership between his ex-wife Lynn Wright and David Kleiman, not between David and himself.  Wright explained his signature on various W&K documents as being “the agent of a director” and told Freedman that he was merely “standing in the shoes of Lynn Wright who was standing in the shoes of W&K.”  In at least one instance, Wright told Freedman that his signature on a tax document, signed “Craig Steven Wright,” was not for himself, the person, but for an entity named “Craig Steven Wright” owned by Lynn Wright and that he was merely a representative.  Adding to the confusion during Wright’s testimony was the structure, ownership and contents of the mysterious “Tulip Trusts” (of which some internet sleuths have even questioned the existence). Wright told the jury the plaintiffs believe the Tulip Trust contains bitcoins jointly mined by David Kleiman and Wright, when really it just contains Wright’s notes and testnet bitcoins worth nothing.  A pattern of alleged forgery  Wright has long been accused of faking documents, including editing and backdating emails and messages, to support his claims that he is Satoshi.  Jonathan Warren, the creator of the messaging app Bitmessage, testified via pre-recorded video deposition last week that screenshots of logs of bitmessages purportedly between David Kleiman and Craig Wright discussing the creation of the Tulip Trust must have been forged because the messages’ sent date predated the public availability of Bitmessage by several months.  Wright was also accused by Ira Kleiman of faking signatures, including David Kleiman’s signature on an agreement giving Wright the contents of W&K dated several months before his death.  Freedman also accused Wright of forging the signature of Jamie Wilson, a one-time executive at several of Wright’s companies, on an ATO document stating that Wilson was a representative of W&K, after Wilson had already told the jury he wasn’t aware of W&K’s existence at the time of his supposed signature.  Toward the conclusion of Wright’s testimony, he said, “My vision is very simple – I want a legal bank.” He added his project would allow people to transmit money quickly and at low cost.  “My vision is there. It remains and I don’t care what’s in my way; I am going to do this or die trying,” he said.  Read more: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi?

BTC could extend losses towards $55k in the coming sessions. Bitcoin started a fresh decline below the $65k and $62k support levels. The price is now trading below $60,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $61,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could extend losses below the $58,500 and $57,500 support levels in the near term. Bitcoin Price Gains Bearish Momentum Bitcoin price started a fresh decline from well above the $65,000 zone. BTC traded below the key $65,000 support level to enter a bearish zone. There was a clear break below the $62,000 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, the price traded below the main $60,000 support zone. A low is formed near $58,630 and the price is now consolidating losses. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $60,000 level. The first major resistance is near the $60,450 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $66,350 swing high to $58,630 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $61,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. A clear break above $61,000 resistance may possibly call open the doors for a steady recovery. The next major resistance sits near the $62,500 level.

A quarter of fund managers expect the price of bitcoin to be over $75,000 in one year, compared with 20% who think it will remain relatively flat, between $50,000 and $75,000, and 19% who think it will fall to $25,000 to $50,000.  Long positions on bitcoin are more crowded than those on environmental, social and governance (ESG), the survey found. Long bitcoin was named the most crowded trade in May and January.  The top answer for “most crowded” trade was long tech with 37% of respondents, followed by long bitcoin at 21%, and long ESG with 14% of the total. Short U.S. Treasurys also rose to 13% from about 10% last month.  In October, only around 10% of fund managers named bitcoin as the “most crowded” trade when it was surpassed by long ESG trades, at about 17% of respondents, and short positions on China and emerging markets stocks, approximately 15%.  In November, 59% of fund managers said bitcoin is a bubble. Back in May, 75% of respondents said bitcoin is in a bubble zone, the Business Standard reported.  Bitcoin also slightly outperformed oil and gold for best asset class in 2022; 12% of respondents named the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, compared with 10% for oil and gold. Emerging markets stocks topped that list at 34% of respondents, followed by S&P 500 at 30%.  The survey includes 345 fund managers from around the world, whose total funds under management are over $1 trillion.
