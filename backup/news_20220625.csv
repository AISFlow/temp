42423035,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy241Lh,1656191784,"Morgan Creek Is Trying to Counter FTX’s BlockFi Bailout, Leaked Call Shows","Cryptocurrency investment firm Morgan Creek Digital is attempting to raise $250 million from investors to purchase a majority stake in crypto lender BlockFi, a leaked investor call from Tuesday reveals.  Morgan Creek’s plan to rapidly assemble an equity offer was hatched in response to crypto exchange FTX’s Tuesday morning announcement that it would extend a $250 million credit line to BlockFi.  Morgan Creek Digital declined to comment. A person with knowledge of the effort said there are multiple venture capital funds that are exploring ways to provide equity financing to BlockFi as the lender struggles to stay afloat.  At stake is the ability of BlockFi’s existing shareholders, including longtime backer Morgan Creek, to recoup their investments.  “I’ve been making calls all day,” Morgan Creek Digital managing partner Mark Yusko said on the leaked call.  According to Yusko, the FTX credit line proposal had a catch for BlockFi’s existing shareholders: It gave FTX the option to buy BlockFi “at essentially zero price.” If FTX were to exercise said option, it would effectively wipe out all of BlockFi’s existing equity shareholders, including management and employees with stock options, as well as all equity investors in the company’s previous venture rounds.  However, Yusko said on the leaked call that BlockFi founders Zac Prince and Flori Marquez had a valid reason for preliminarily accepting the terms: Of the several emergency financing offers BlockFi received, FTX’s was the only one that would not subordinate client assets to the rescuer.  In other words, unless BlockFi went with FTX, its depositors would have had to wait in line behind the new lender to be repaid. Additionally, BlockFi had not received any equity financing options at that stage. (Yusko did not identify any of the other firms that proposed bailout packages for BlockFi.)  Read more: BlockFi Receives $250M Credit Facility From FTX  BlockFi CEO Prince tweeted on June 21 that the company had signed a preliminary term sheet with FTX. Yusko told investors on the leaked call that day that FTX and BlockFi were “probably three days away from signing a definitive agreement.”  “We are still negotiating the terms of the deal and cannot share more information at this time,” a BlockFi spokesperson told CoinDesk on Saturday. “We anticipate sharing more on the terms of the deal with the public at a later date.” FTX did not respond to requests for comment by press time.  According to Yusko on the leaked call, in the event that FTX exercised its option after extending the credit line, only investors in the most senior tranche of the company’s latest raise would get back anything, and even that would amount to pennies on the dollar.  Morgan Creek, which participated in several funding rounds for BlockFi, would be among those holding the bag.  “The only alternative is to raise an equivalent amount in equity and that’s what we’re working on,” Yusko told investors on the call. “I would say it's a 10% possibility but not zero.”  A recording of the call, which CoinDesk reviewed, offers a rare window into the closed-door negotiations to rescue BlockFi, one of the crypto industry’s largest lenders, amid a meltdown in the digital asset and broader financial markets. It also shows how the current turbulence echoes past financial crises, with Yusko comparing FTX’s rescue package to J. Pierpont Morgan’s bailout of the Knickerbocker Trust in 1907.  Indeed, Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs has been trying to organize an investor group to scoop up assets of another troubled crypto lender, Celsius Network, at steep discounts in the event that company files for bankruptcy.  Read more: Goldman Sachs Leading Investor Group to Buy Celsius Assets: Sources  On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that FTX was in talks to acquire an equity stake in BlockFi. It is unclear whether new developments since Tuesday have substantially changed negotiations.  When asked by an investor on the call, Yusko said Morgan Creek would be open to an “in-between deal” where FTX (led by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried) and Morgan Creek both put up a portion of the capital.  “I will definitely try to pursue [a joint deal],” said Yusko. “Not that I have SBF on speed-dial, but I could probably get that call.”  Yusko said that he spoke with one potential lead investor that could write a $100 million check, as well as two other investors who “expressed interest” and could write checks up to $50 million.  Morgan Creek Digital, co-founded by Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, is one of BlockFi’s largest investors. The firm has participated in BlockFi’s Series A through D fundraising rounds across three funds and a special purpose vehicle (SPV), a type of investment structure that allows an investor to invest in a single company.  Yusko cautioned that while Morgan Creek was doing all it could to salvage its investment in BlockFi, success was far from assured.  “It's not over, but it is definitely looking dark,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/25/morgan-creek-is-trying-to-counter-ftxs-blockfi-bailout-leaked-call-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/861de8f58264849c0cce25a16a57df4e200bd105-2649x2396.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ivanov promised to gradually pay off the debt without causing the coin to depreciate. Currently, the Waves creator owes more than $530 million. Ivanov has gradually spent the USDN in his wallet over the past month. Repayment Of The Debt Waves have expressed confidence in the repayment of the debt, but lenders attempting to remove assets face restrictions and fierce competition for any available liquidity. Some dispute the viability of the debt&apos;s repayment. On May 31, holders of Vires tokens cast a vote on the proposal. Vires has set a daily withdrawal cap of USD 1,000 Coin (USDC) or Tether (USDT) per user, yet users have had difficulty withdrawing any money. Vires receive periodic additions of liquidity from the corporation, which are quickly withdrawn. Decline in Cryptocurrency Prices After de-pegging several times during the decline in cryptocurrency prices, USDN defied expectations that it was about to collapse.

Key technical points: The AXS market price has appreciated 16.30% over the past 24 hours. The price action forms a bullish candle reaching the $20 mark. The 24-hour trading volume of Axie Infinity is $469 Million, indicating a hike of 214%. Past Performance of AXS The AXS price chart showcases a falling trend under the influence of a resistance trendline, accounting for a drop of 80% to a low of $12. However, buyers quickly hoard the token at the 2021 level to reverse the trend resulting in a 45% jump to $17. Source- Tradingview AXS Technical Analysis AXS price action displays an upward trend after the trendline breakout and the bullish candle forms with a surge in trading volume. Therefore, the chances of a price jump to the overhead resistance at $20 increase significantly. The DMI indicator shows a bullish crossover of the DI lines, but the falling trend in the ADX line represents a weakness in trend momentum. Hence, traders hoping for a bullish trend might have to wait for a $20 breakout to find an increase in trend momentum.

In a recovery, SYS crypto prices may break above $0.17 and race to June 2022 highs. Past Performance of Syscoin The Syscoin token is up double digits when writing, adding 18 percent against the USDT. At spot rates, SYS crypto prices are rising, in sync with the broader market, in a retest. From the SYS technical analysis in the daily chart, buyers are currently in control, bottoming up in a retest of a critical resistance line. Syscoin Technical Analysis Buyers are confident, adding to their longs, as evident in the daily chart. Notably, there are encouraging higher highs relative to the lower BB as the upside momentum builds up. The confirmation of June 23 gains with rising trading volumes is positive and comprises a bullish breakout. Accordingly, traders may find opportunities to add to their longs on every pullback towards $0.14 and $0.12 in the short term. Further gains above the middle BB and $0.17 may see SYS token prices surge to $0.27. What to Expect from SYS? Syscoin bulls are in charge at spot rates. Nonetheless, price action is skewed for sellers until there is a solid close above $0.17 and the middle BB.

With primary support at $0.45, ADA prices may rally to retest June 2022 highs in short to medium term. Past Performance of Cardano Cardano prices are printing higher at spot rates, as per the performance in the daily chart. ADA is up three percent on the last trading day, printing this week&apos;s highs and unwinding recent losses. From the current arrangement, ADA may likely extend gains and breach the 20-day moving average in a refreshing breakout. This formation would likely form the basis for the next leg up. Cardano Technical Analysis Technically, ADA coin prices have been resilient. Despite sharp losses from late last week, Cardano bulls soaked in selling pressure, retaining prices above $0.45. The multi-week support line is critical and anchors the current rally. In the short term, traders may find entries on every attempt to push prices back to $0.45, with targets at $0.55—the June 15 highs. If buyers build on those gains, ADA may expand to $0.66 and retest June 2022 highs. What to Expect from ADA? Cardano is steady at spot rates. Nonetheless, ADA token prices are still bearish from an effort versus results perspective. A clear buy trend would be defined once there is a refreshing rally above $0.66 and prices hold steady above the critical support at $0.45.The post Cardano Technical Analysis: ADA May Retest June 2022 Highs appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/cardano-technical-analysis-ada-may-retest-june-2022-highs/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-technical-analysis-ada-may-retest-june-2022-highs,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
