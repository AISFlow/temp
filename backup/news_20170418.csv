42399781,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydgY,1492539971,Blockchain Startup Factom Raises $8 Million in Extended Series A,"Blockchain startup Factom has finished raising just over $8m as part of an extended Series A round.  Last October, the firm said that it had raised $4.2m as part of the funding in an effort to raise capital ahead of planned product launches. Taking part in the round, according to AustinInno, include Harvest Equity and Peeli Ventures, along with several as-yet-unnamed local investors.  According to public records from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Factom raised approximately $8,027,535 during the round.  Previously, the firm – which uses its own blockchain network to verify the the integrity of data – had raised $1.1m in a crowdsale conducted in mid-2015, before going on to raise about $400,000 in seed funding later that year.  Yet since its launch, the project has attracted its share of criticism, centered mainly at its crowdsale of a publicly traded token (known as factoids), as well as a headline-grabbing – but ultimately stalled – effort to partner with the government of Honduras.  In recent months, the company has moved to launch a new mortgage-focused product, dubbed Harmony.

42399761,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydqO,1492532188,The Biggest US Health Insurer is Hiring a Blockchain Director,"The largest US-based health insurer is looking to hire a new point person on blockchain development.  UnitedHealth is seeking a ""director of blockchain platforms and applications development"", according to a job postinghttps://careers.unitedhealthgroup.com/data/jobs/information-technology/707196-director-of-blockchain-platform-and-applications-development-eden-prairie-mn-or-boston-ma.aspx earlier this month. The hire would work for Optum, an IT-focused subsidiary of the insurer.  It’s the first indication that UnitedHealth – the biggest of its kind in the US and number six on the Fortune 500 list – is looking at blockchain. Though UnitedHealth is far from alone amongst the world’s insurers, its market share and size represents a notable entry into the space among players in that industry.  While the posting is short on details about any specific projects being undertaken (the “platform” element of the title hints at possible approaches), a small statement included indicates that the insurer is looking to make some kind of blockchain play in the long-term.  The company wrote:  ""Here, innovation isn't about another gadget, it's about making health care data available wherever and whenever people need it, safely and reliably. There's no room for error. We are about to disrupt healthcare by applying blockchain technologies.""  The past few months have seen significant developments in the insurance space, particularly around consortium-level, collaborative elements. Earlier this month, for example, a group of ten insurers in China moved to test a new platform.  Last fall, several major European insurers launched a new consortium which has since grown to include 15 firms. That group is reportedly expected to move an in-development platform project to commercial scale by the end of this year.

The company disclosed the update in an email to customers this morning. In addition to USD support, Kraken is supporting wire transfer deposits and withdrawals in euros and British pounds. The San Francisco-based startup, founded in 2011, is launching the updated deposit feature effectively immediately, though the withdrawal upgrade won't go live until 24th April, the exchange said.  It's a notable service update given the timing and the state of the global bitcoin exchange space.  For example, Bitfinex, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by USD volume, said yesterday that it is now unable to accept inbound wire transfers due to banking problems. The British Virgin Islands-based company had previously gone to court over issues related to outbound wire transfers denominated in USD (only to withdraw that suit a week later).  Further, China's exchange ecosystem, under effective lockdown due to regulatory pressures, has yet to reactivate bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals amidst ongoing discussion with the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank.  So far, bitcoin's market has continued its upward momentum in the face of these challenges, though that's not to say there isn't concern. In recent days, traders have begun to voice concerns that market operations may be deviating from the norm.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Kraken.

42399762,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydrN,1492520409,German Finance Watchdog Shutters OneCoin Payment Processor,"Germany's top finance regulator has moved to shut down a payment processor tied to to the OneCoin cryptocurrency scheme, a digital currency service that has faced widespread allegations of fraud.  The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) said on 10th April that it was freezing the accounts of IMS International Marketing Services GmbH, which is registered in Germany.  According to BaFin, the firm accepted €360m on behalf of OneCoin between December 2015 and December 2016. Of that amount, €29m is being held in the accounts frozen by the regulator.  The agency went on to threaten financial penalties in excess of €1m, going on to say:  ""In case IMS should not abide by the order to cease business, BaFin threatened to impose a coercive fine of €1.5m; for non-compliance with the winding-down order, it would impose a coercive fine of €150,000. By law, the administrative acts, including the threats of coercive fines, are immediately enforceable.""  With the move, BaFin becomes the latest regulator in Europe to take action against elements of the OneCoin scheme.  OneCoin is a multi-level marketing scheme that pitches an eponymous digital currency as an investment opportunity. Prospective buyers purchase batches of tokens which can then be redeemed online, though those involved are strongly encouraged to find buyers of their own – a characteristic that lends itself to accusations that OneCoin is a pyramid scheme.  In the past year, regulators in several African countries have warned consumers about local efforts by OneCoin to solicit investors. In the UK, London police have been investigating OneCoin since as early as September, while in Italy, regulators moved last month to prohibit promotional efforts for OneCoin by local proponents.  Notably, BaFin made it clear in a statement that it was moving against the firm due to unlicensed money activities rather than the legality of sales of OneCoin tokens.  ""BaFin does not have the right to decide as to the validity under civil law of the 'OneCoins' sales contracts. It may therefore not answer questions of this nature,"" the agency said.

42399751,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydfZ,1492518605,Primavera de Filippi on Blockchain and the Quest to Decentralize Society,"""I went into the blockchain and I never left.""  As a researcher at CERSA/CNRS and Harvard Primavera De Filippi is perhaps most well-known for blockchain ideas that sound as if they come straight out of a sci-fi novel. Case in point, De Filippi presented a robotic flower that lives and reproduces via bitcoin micropayments at a conference earlier this year.  Of course, there are plenty of big ideas swirling around in the industry, but whether or not all or any of these are viable is still up for debate. And that hangs heavy on De Filippi, too.  She sighed heavily when The DAO – the most prominent example of a leaderless organization functioning on blockchain that unravelled after an attacker exploited the code last summer – was brought up.  But even with that misstep, De Filippi is still inspired by the potential for smart contracts to create decentralized companies and governance systems with blockchain technology.  Governing society  To really dig in, De Filippi has to look at humanity a little bit differently.  ""It actually changes a little bit the way we go about society, when you use technology as opposed to regulation,"" she said.  She's been studying the advantages and drawbacks of governing through technology (as opposed to regulation) for some time. For example, in the context of blockchain, she's been trying to work out how smart contracts could change laws and regulations.  And her findings have eventually led her to the mantra: ""From competition to cooperation.""  ""So, I think we need to come up with different governance structures which are not market-based, but which will ensure some sort of decentralized power within the community,"" she said.  That might turn some heads in the blockchain industry, which has historically been made up of libertarian-leaning free market supporters. But, in her mind, building a decentralized system within the confines of a market-based economy doesn't make sense.  ""It’s kind of funny because there's such an obsession with creating a decentralized system. But, if you use a market-based mechanism to govern that system, obviously it's going to centralize itself, you know? So, what's the point? Why are you building a decentralized system in the first place?” she said.  Instead, she's trying to engineer a type of cooperative system, all on top of blockchain technology. As part of her research at Harvard and CNRS, De Filippi has been working, for many years, on the elaboration of new governance systems for decentralized organizations, including the Backfeed protocol.  Proof-of-value  Another problem for decentralized blockchain-based systems, a more technical one that she's been exploring solutions for is a Sybil attack.  Effectively, if it's easy for users to create identities then it's possible to exploit that with one user creating hundreds of accounts, then using them to, say, vote, acting as 100 unique users.  ""When you're in a model where you don’t identify who is a part of the system, then it’s really complicated to avoid people creating fake identities in order to cheat,"" De Filippi explained.  Bitcoin addresses this with proof-of-work, in which miners need to use some energy (in bitcoin's case, computing power) in order to create blocks of transactions and earn block rewards. Ethereum aims to resolve this issue in future with a different system called proof-of-stake.  The Backfeed team, however, is working on its own solution called proof-of-value. The security of the proof-of-value system is supposed to be based on the reputation of users, and while users can create as many accounts as they want, it’s not quite so easy to impact the system with them.  “My reputation, my influence within the system only depends on the perceived value that the community has given to the contribution that is associated with this identity,"" said De Filippi. ""So instead of being based on this objective amount of hashing power, it’s based on this subjective evaluation of the contribution that I have made.""  However, it's still hard to say whether the experiment will pan out.

42399766,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydwI,1492515016,Miami 2014: The Last Days of Bitcoin's Wild West,"Bruce Fenton is managing director of wealth management firm Atlantic Financial, a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation and host of the annual industry event Satoshi Roundtable.  In this entry in CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Fenton recalls the wide-eyed days of TNABC 2014 – a two-day conference held in Miami that he argues marked the beginning of a new, more professional bitcoin era.  It concluded with a rooftop party, had controversial dancing girls and saw one startup hand out bitcoin wallets with neon vodka shots.  That's probably what most people remember about The North American Bitcoin Conference Miami. Organized by Moe Levin and held in the days when bitcoin's price had gone from a few dollars to more than the price of gold, the industry had yet to hit the turbulence that this early success would bring.  As an industry without leaders, a governing structure or centralized control, we relied – and still rely – on our peers. This isn't just for validating transactions and making sure that the network works, but for sharing news, knowledge and the social interaction needed to keep pace with change. Because of the lack of structure, events are particularly important, and early industry events had an entirely different character than most do today.  What many might forget about TNABC 2014, however, is that it was simultaneously the last of the era of pure 'community events' and the first of the 'business events' to follow.  At my first bitcoin conference, for example, I wore the standard 'uniform' of a venture capitalist or investment professional: khaki pants, a collared dress shirt and a blazer. I was vastly overdressed. To try to blend in with a sea of casual T-shirts, leather jackets and Phineas Gage (who was wearing a pink tutu), I quietly slid off my blazer crumpled it into a ball and threw it in the corner.  During the coffee break, I introduced myself to a young hacker-looking fellow and mentioned that I was interested in the technology and came from the world of investment management.  I don't think he meant it in a rude way when he responded:  ""Yeah, we don't really need suit-wearing Wall Street stooges here… Bitcoin is different.""  Times are changing  By January 2014, the industry had changed: record price highs and new interest from investors were shaping the landscape. Someone wearing a suit coat would now no longer be alone.  Indeed, a few professional-looking executives were sitting near the front row in Miami, and whispers could be heard saying, ""See those guys? They are venture capitalists! Here! At a bitcoin event!""  The thought that serious investors would be interested in this industry was both exciting and validating.  Outside my hotel room, an orange Lamborghini was parked bearing the license plate ""BitPay"", a wise publicity stunt for one of the few young startups seeking to raise early venture investments around a bitcoin business.  The conference hall still had that same exciting buzz that was characteristic of the earliest bitcoin events – few, if any of us, were attending with any hopes or expectations of an ROI.  There was no division, no scaling debate, no pressure from investors to deliver, no rivalries, no major regulatory involvement and no notable agendas, just pure energy and excitement about something new.  The attendees walked from room to room overwhelmed with positive energy and a steady flow of information.  Unity and belief  Steve Beauregard took the stage at the event, as did Charlie Lee.  Shortly after the major announcement that TigerDirect would be one of the first major retailers to accept bitcoin as a payment option,  Roger Ver gave a presentation that very few of us had seen before. He talked about the potential for this technology, he reassured many that it was ""not too late"" to become involved and he closed with a heartfelt statement that people having control of their own money can reduce war.  I'm sure I was not the only one in the audience who had a tear in their eye thinking about the potential of this amazing technology.  After hearing from Jeff Berwick and Elizabeth Ploshay (now McCauley), I headed to the adjacent conference room to hear from a young entrepreneur named Charlie Shrem. I was particularly interested in his thoughts on the upcoming BitLicense hearings, which were scheduled for later that week.  As we all now know, Charlie never made it to Miami nor to testify at the BitLicense hearings (he was arrested at the airport in New York). His arrest was used as fuel for Ben Lawsky's media show, and would throw the hearings into disarray, placing bitcoin proponents on the defensive.  New ideas  As if the event had not been eventful enough, a very young man named Vitalik Buterin – who's title on the program handout was ""Head Writer at Bitcoin Magazine"" – started his presentation in the main room.  This was the first announcement of a brand-new project called ethereum.  Now an accomplished presenter with hundreds of engagements under his belt, the Vitalik of January 2014 was nowhere near as polished. On his first major public speaking event, he seemed a bit nervous and hard to follow. Whatever lack of polish he may have had in his presentation skills, however, did not hamper interest in this project.  After listening with rapt attention, at the conclusion of his presentation, a mob of a couple dozen people swarmed the then little-known 19-year-old. Forty-something computer scientists and developers flocked to learn more about joining the project, some of them reportedly changing careers to join ethereum right on the spot.  Brock Pierce and Nic Cary concluded the day's speakers.  Change to come  Buzzing from information overload, I retired to my room at The Clevelander.  It was a day full of excitement and energy. It was a lot to process. And looking back, there were hints of the troubles to come as well.  Earlier in the day, an experienced bitcoiner warned me about impending troubles at an exchange called Mt Gox.  Tired as I was, I decided to heed his advice and move my bitcoins out of the exchange. I received an error message mentioning something about issues with a hot wallet. I broke my withdrawals into smaller pieces and was able to get them to execute. I did several transfers this way until I received a different error: ""Bitcoin withdrawals are suspended until further notice"".  This suspension would, of course, never be lifted.  But I wasn't concerned then. As I drifted to sleep, I reflected on the incredible people I had met, the weekend and exciting potential ahead.  It was wild and crazy, a space filled with the most interesting and eclectic group of geeks, geniuses and rebels I had ever seen. The early days of pure speculation were ending. I was sure real capital and established interests were moving in.  This proved true. We'd have some 'group hug' moments, but we'd never again be the eager, wide-eyed band of idealists who came together in Miami.  Like many, I thought to myself:  ""This bitcoin thing is real. It’s here to stay. I can’t wait to see what happens next.""

42399753,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydhX,1492511447,Japan's Government Develops Method for Assessing Blockchains,"In light of the hype and lack of clarity surrounding blockchain, one of Japan's government ministries has developed a methodology for evaluating projects in the industry.  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) published details about the methodology, which was created by the Information Economy Division of the ministry's Commerce and Information Policy Bureau.  According to the published presentation, METI is positioning the process as a way to assess projects for a variety of use cases, while evaluating 32 necessary characteristics such as scalability, privacy and overall reliability.  Those involved with the methodology's creation say it was developed to objectively weigh blockchain implementations.  The presentation states:  ""[N]o evaluation indices or criteria had been established to adequately assess the features of the technologies and to compare them with existing systems. This causes the public anxiety, misunderstanding, and unreasonable hopes to blockchain technologies, and leading to a potential unwillingness to introduce the technology.""  That the ministry would take such a step is unsurprising, given that it has fostered blockchain work in the past.  METI has been publicly researching the tech since late 2015, arguing the government itself should play a supporting role. The ministry has also sponsored a trip abroad for domestic bitcoin and blockchain startups.

42399747,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydea,1492507836,How Blockchain Could End Travel Industry Pain Points,"Trond Vidar Bjorøy heads new product development and implementation for Nordic markets at travel management firm ATPI.  In this opinion piece, Vidar Bjorøy argues that blockchain can eliminate a number of pain points for both travellers and travel companies.  At this point, most blockchain enthusiasts know that distributed ledger tech has potential beyond fintech. Yet, one industry that hasn't seen much attention from those enthusiasts is the travel industry. And it's one that deals regularly with a number of pain points that blockchain technology has the potential to solve.  Here are some of the more notable issues and how blockchain could help:  1. Overbooking  Everyone saw that man get dragged off a United Airline's flight last week, right?  Blockchain's ability to prevent double spending could in theory remove the problem of double bookings in the industry, which would hopefully (for both passengers and airlines) eliminate instances like this from happening.  It should be noted, though, that overbooking is very much a part of a decades-old strategy to increase profits and optimize resources, so unless the practice is made illegal, it might not be the use case that will drive widespread adoption of blockchain in the travel industry.  2. Fraud  Merchants that sell travel are typically seen as high risk because of the amount of refunds and chargebacks that occur in the industry.  But with blockchain, once a payment has been made, typically you can't reverse it. And this mechanism will make fraudulent cases easier to spot and less likely to occur.  Blockchain could also ease PCI DSS compliance (a credit card security standard), at least for travel management companies and other incumbents in the space.  In a blockchain-enabled world where cardholder data is no longer stored in corporate databases and instead stored on a distributed network, along with the booking transactions – to whom does PCI apply? Probably the companies that develop the solutions that will let travel companies store our sensitive data on the network.  3. Identity and reputation  A big part of the world's population is excluded and disconnected from the global economy today.  Decentralization through crypto-economies will enable billions of people to get access to basic financial services, connecting them with the rest of the world. And to give everyone in the world the opportunity to travel, consumers need a means of proving their identity, one that is impossible to forge or change. This could be provided through access to reputation-based identity systems.  Even though there are identity systems in use for authentication today, like federated identity and social login, you can't easily build on them to pull in data from many sources or use the attributes that you want when you want them – unless you integrate with every party.  Decentralized identity systems are here to fix that.  As a trusted individual with a reputation guaranteed by the blockchain, you could say goodbye to waiting in lines, TSA and obtrusive checking of personal details.  4. Traveller profiles  While blockchain is very much about moving values, it's also about handling and securing data in better ways.  In travel, user profile security and privacy have always been hot topics. When a company enters into an agreement with a travel management company (TMC), airline or other supplier, the company usually needs to give that supplier access to employee data so they are able to provide the expected service.  Whether that process is manual or automated, building a well-functioning profiling process takes time and effort and creates friction on both sides.  If employees had their information on the blockchain, this could remove much of the pain on both sides. The companies wouldn't have to build new API connections between the supplier's profile database and the buyer's HR system for every new implementation. And manual profile workflows would become history.  There'd be no need for employees to create user accounts with multiple suppliers, duplicating their information along with thousands of other users on systems that stand the risk of being breached. Nor would they have to adopt every new supplier's user interface.  Instead, there'd be just one unified profile available to those explicitly given access.  5. Settlement  Among the more obvious improvements we will see from the blockchain is the ability to move money faster.  Many fintech innovations – the removal of middlemen and their fees, money transfers in real-time, instant settlement, streamlined and continuous auditing – will benefit the travel industry as well.  6. Loyalty  By now we've probably all heard about the promises of interoperable loyalty programs: instant credit, exchanging points, transferring points between friends, receiving personal promotions, converting points into cryptocurrency.  But what about buying a flight ticket with points that you earned from flying with a competing airline?  When traveling, I'm not a very loyal person. I just want to enjoy the best offers I can at any time so this setup is perfect for me and multiple other travellers that aren't loyal to one airline.  But could this become a predicament for the loyalty program owners? Maybe. But we might also see models emerge where participating businesses unite forces to meet these traveler expectations.  7. Policy and compliance  TMCs today have a role as the gatekeeper, there to help corporates stay compliant.  But what if blockchain could take over this responsibility?  Imagine the company travel manager receiving real-time alerts for policy breaches that are about to happen. Whenever an employee is trying to book a trip outside the correct channel, a direct two-way communication channel is set up between the travel manager and the, knowingly or not, disloyal employee.  Or perhaps we’ll see a paradigm shift in managed travel and booking behaviour.  Remember open booking? Perhaps the blockchain with its potential for unmatched transparency, security and privacy will be the enabler of this promised model for the future of managed travel. Book where you want as long as it's within policy. Your travel data still gets collected, consolidated and made available to you, instantly.  8. Duty of care  With blockchain, it's easy to foresee how risk management systems could be granted access to a traveler's location at any time.  The travel manager, looking at the map of her employees' whereabouts, would see this update whenever a new reservation gets created, modified or cancelled, plus when a traveller boards the plane, checks in at the hotel or starts the rental car. Or perhaps the system doesn't use reservation details for traveller tracking, but instead receives real-time updates from an IoT-enabled device.  Health records stored on the blockchain network could also aid a traveller in need of medical help.  9. Smart contracts  Smart contract transactions are executed in autonomous software code, not law.  If we look at a legal contract or a business agreement, it's basically the same as code – a series of if-then statements.  For example:  Hotel A enters an agreement with TMC B with a clause saying that for the next six months, room nights booked more than seven days in advance will give a higher commission than those booked later. With today's model, both parties would sign a contract. When the period ends, both the TMC and hotel might have to run reports to identify the total number of online bookings from the TMC, or they use some commission consolidation service to document it for them.  Eventually, the correct commission amount gets paid out, although this takes time and effort, plus there might be middlemen involved in the process taking their piece of the pie.  What if all that was programmed into a smart contract?  There are obviously many benefits to this, including cost savings with the removal of intermediaries (lawyers, notaries, brokers, etc), time savings from cutting down business processes and the trust achieved from storing documents encrypted on a shared ledger.  For now, it helps knowing how to code if you want to build smart contracts, but there are currently visual editors that help write and deploy smart contracts for you. Eventually tools will come that enable any business role to create smart contracts.  10. Removing silos  Will we see a predominance of permissioned and private blockchains in our industry as the big incumbents try to evolve and maintain their power? We're already good at closed ecosystems, so this could be the next natural step in that direction.  On the other hand, perhaps the very nature of the blockchain – the more open and public you keep it, the faster more nodes can connect to it, and the bigger, stronger and more secure your network gets – could actually be what this industry needs to really disrupt itself?  There are initiatives that seek to enable connectivity between different blockchains, building an 'internet of blockchains', if you will, so there’s hope of seeing large-scale systems that open up for collaboration even if the industry should go down the route of private networks.  However, both public and private blockchains have advantages in the travel industry.  The established public blockchains, such as bitcoin and ethereum, have an advantage in scale both of payments and the applications that can be built on them, compared to the newer alternatives. Newer and smaller blockchains, on the other hand, will have an easier task achieving the network-wide consensus required to make strategic changes to the protocol.  I'm hoping, although I'm not yet fully convinced, that blockchain will revolutionize the travel industry. After all, we're talking about an industry where fax is an indispensable part of many business processes and where 40-year old tech dominates distribution.
