42379288,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX85GdT,1489189671,Industry Speaks Out in Aftermath of Bitcoin ETF Rejection,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected an effort to list the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF (COIN), prompting comment from many of those who watched and waited for the decision.  Reactions to the news were, as can be expected, mixed. Markets, having hit a new all-time high of roughly $1,325 prior to the decision, fell sharply before recovering above $1,100. Some observers deemed it a setback for bitcoin, while others, by comparison, said that it wouldn't have any long-term impact.  When reached for comment, Tyler Winklevoss struck an optimistic note, telling CoinDesk that more engagement with the agency would follow.  He said in a statement:  ""We remain optimistic and committed to bringing COIN to market, and look forward to continuing to work with the SEC staff. We began this journey almost four years ago, and are determined to see it through. We agree with the SEC that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors.""  Also striking a positive note was Spencer Bogart, head of research for Blockchain Capital. Bogart told CoinDesk that he thinks the rejection to the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF will have no impact on bitcoin’s ""compelling fundamental growth story"".  However, he argued that the decision dampens the chances that the SEC will approve other bitcoin-tied financial products, deeming their likelihood ""extremely low"".  Bogart said:  ""The ground for disapproval of COIN appear to be driven by concerns with bitcoin’s underlying markets as opposed to something specific to the COIN filing.""  Industry takes  Others took a more critical position in light of the exchange's reasoning behind its decision. In a 38-page document, the agency pointed to a lack of surveillance in the global bitcoin market, as well as an overall lack of regulation that it posited could spur investor fraud.  Yet Jerry Brito, executive director of the non-profit Coin Center, argued that the decision ""creates a chicken and egg problem"" in which roadblocks to new financial products hinder the kind of development needed to address those concerns.  Brito explained:  ""How do we develop well-capitalized and regulated markets in the U.S. and Europe if financial innovators aren’t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?""  Charles Hayter, CEO and founder of cryptocurrency data site CryptoCompare, told CoinDesk that the rejected bitcoin ETF application, had ""dashed"" the ""hopes that bitcoin would move towards mainstream finance"".  At the same time, Hayter went on to say that the SEC's decision doesn't preclude the launch of other bitcoin exchange-traded products. Sweden, for example, is home to the Bitcoin Tracker One exchange product.  “Whether other jurisdictions will allow a Bitcoin ETF remains to be seen,"" said Hayter. ""But for the time being all is not well – and it seems as if the other ETFs in the pipeline for the SEC are facing the same stone wall.""  Looking ahead  But will the decision slow bitcoin down itself? Adam Back, CEO of bitcoin startup Blockstream, said he thinks today's turn of events has only delayed the inevitable.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I believe this decision by the SEC today is a temporary detour on bitcoin's inevitable path that will sooner or later lead to every Wall Street and Main Street investor being able to participate in this promising technology of the future, and in parallel, adoption will continue apace for the disruptive, internet native, digital gold and electronic cash properties from which bitcoin derives its value.""  Others, too, reflect on the decision in light of the digital currency's future. Dave Nadig, CEO of industry news site ETF.com, said he wasn't surprised by the SEC's move. In fact, he posited that bitcoin's unregulated nature is an inherent part of the digital currency.  ""The decision isn't that surprising. Ultimately this is less about what bitcoin is or isn't, and is about the underlying market structure for bitcoin itself. If the SEC doesn't know where the buck stops on a security, it's hard for them to get behind it,"" he said, concluding:  ""Honestly, the whole point of bitcoin is the buck never stops. It's unregulated by design.""

42379293,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX85GiV,1489182684,Bitcoin Prices Plunge After SEC's ETF Refusal,"Bitcoin prices fell sharply after the US Securities and Exchange Commission shot down a bid to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The digital currency’s price fell to as little as $1,022.68 at 21:00 UTC, the lowest since roughly mid-February, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). This figure represents a nearly 30% decline from the all-time high of $1,325.81 that bitcoin prices reached earlier in the session.  At the time of report, bitcoin prices have recovered above the $1,100 line, hitting $1,109.06 at press time.  The digital currency’s sharp price fluctuations took place amid robust trading volume, as major exchanges including Bitfinex and Kraken experienced a large increase in transaction activity during the session.  Market participants traded 46.4k and 22.8k BTC through these exchanges in the 24 hours leading up to roughly 21:30 UTC, compared to an average of 26.7k and 13.9k that went through these exchanges during sessions over the past week, Bitcoinity data reveals.

42379296,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX85Gon,1489179822,SEC Rejects Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF Bid,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission has denied a bid to list a bitcoin-tied exchange-traded fund (ETF), citing the risk of fraud and a lack of regulation among the world’s bitcoin markets.  The decision caps a more than three-year quest by bitcoin investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who first sought to list the bitcoin-tied product in mid-2013. The SEC has been weighing a proposed rule change that would pave the way for the ETF to be listed on the Bats BZX Exchange.  In that time, the SEC has solicited numerous public comments and punted its decision forward several times. As well, the ETF’s backers have expanded the scope of the offering from an initial $20m to $100m.  According to a publicly distributed notice detailing the decision, the SEC said:  ""As discussed further below, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.""  The agency went on to specify that it believes a mix of regulatory opaqueness and fraud risk should preclude any kind of bitcoin ETF at this time.  The SEC said:  “The Commission believes that, in order to meet this standard, an exchange that lists and trades shares of commodity-trust exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) must, in addition to other applicable requirements, satisfy two requirements that are dispositive in this matter. First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.”  That said, the SEC left the door open to future exchange products tied to the digital currency.  “The Commission notes that bitcoin is still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop,” the document reads. “Should such markets develop, the Commission could consider whether a bitcoin ETP would, based on the facts and circumstances then presented, be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act.”  The full ETF decision can be found below:    34-80206 by CoinDesk on Scribd    Image Credit: Image via TechCrunch Disrupt, by Max Morse for TechCrunch",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/03/10/sec-rejects-winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-bid,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d9b3f73f97dc7726954efeeb1068713e672b431-1024x530.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The US Securities and Exchange Commission has confirmed that it will release its decision on the ETF sought by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss today, but bitcoin investors and market watchers are abuzz with speculation as to the timing of the release. Amidst the wait, bitcoin prices have bounced to new all-time highs.  While the SEC declined to comment on when it would publish its decision, those who have seen similar announcements from the agency say it could come as early as 4pm ET or as late as 6pm ET – essentially, once US stock markets close their doors.  Jeff Bishop, ETF expert and co-founder of investor message board platform RagingBull.com, told CoinDesk:  ""They like to push things to the last minute. When announcing news like this, I have found they want to do it outside of stock market hours.""  Others echoed of this view, including Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, who affirmed that he has heard chatter that the SEC will announce its decision between 5pm ET and 6pm ET.  Phil Bak, a former New York Stock Exchange managing director and current CEO of ETF issuer ACSI Funds, said he thinks the SEC will wait until US markets close to reveal its decision.  ""Usually they come in during the morning, but in this case we can probably expect it after the close … I would expect it between 4:00 and 6:00 or so,"" he said in an email.

The agency is hosting an event today focused on improving awareness among retail investors about market risks. As part of it, the SEC has opened an email line for people to submit questions.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, those hungry for information about the bitcoin ETF proposed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been sending in queries to that email line. The SEC is currently weighing a proposed rule change that would clear the ETF to be listed on the Bats BZX exchange.  While it’s not immediately clear how many requests the SEC has received, an agency staffer commented on the queries while highlighting the Q&A line, telling the audience:  ""I will say that, for people that are emailing in, we have nothing to say about bitcoin, so please stop asking. I don't know what that means, but that's what I've been told to say.""  The years-long process to get the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF approved is expected to come to a conclusion today, a move confirmed by an SEC representative when reached at press time. MarketWatch journalist Ryan Vlastelica reported earlier that an SEC representative had similarly confirmed the planned move.

42379292,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX85Gl1,1489163106,New Bitcoin Core Release Gives Boost to Block Relay Network,"The latest software release from the Bitcoin Core development community provided a boost to a network aimed at broadcasting transaction blocks more quickly around the world.  The Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine, or FIBRE, was unveiled last summer as successor to the earlier Bitcoin Relay Network. Previously described as a kind of ""nervous system"" for the network, the concept at its heart seeks to enable miners to gain access to block data more quickly, helping them avoid creating orphan blocks, for one.  As shown on GitHub, FIBRE got some bug fixes along with its first release tied to Core's latest software version. But according to Core contributor Matt Corallo, it was work connected to compact blocks – as well as development related to how efficiently nodes on the network can transmit data – that resulted in a boost to FIBRE’s ability to move block information worldwide.  Corallo explained:  ""One of the key stats I track is reliability of sources for given miners. eg if Bitfury finds a block in Georgia, and my public network receives the block via some node that is in the US, that’s a pretty good indicator that something is amiss and there is room for optimization. Even worse, if I don’t receive the block reliably from the same nodes every time, that’s a pretty good indicator that the block is taking a hop somewhere else before I get it, again, room for optimization.""  Corallo went on to say that he has “noticed a remarkable improvement here” since the shift to 0.14.0 began.  ""Bitfury is especially noticeable, but also my block sources from a few of the Chinese pools have gotten much more stable,"" he added.

42379287,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX85Gfz,1489156206,Bitcoin Exchange Bitso Trials Canada-Mexico Remittance Service,"Mexican bitcoin exchange Bitso has been working with Canadian payments startup Paycase to create a new remittance corridor between the two countries.  Bitso, which raised $2.5m in new funding last September, said it has been working with Paycase to send funds from bank accounts in Canada to others in Mexico.  In one instance, the firms said today, a fiat currency micropayment was sent from a Canadian bank to Paycase before it was transmitted to Bitso using bitcoin, before finally settling as fiat in a Mexican bank account. According to the startups, the entire process took roughly three minutes to complete.  Pablo Gonzalez, Bitso’s chief executive, said:  ""We believe in the power of bitcoin as a rail to make financial services more competitive and create financial inclusion in markets such as Mexico.""  While they did not provide an indication of when the service might go live, the two companies framed the work in the context of economic turbulence in North America.  Paycase CEO Joseph Weinberg said: ""We believe this corridor becomes ever more critical to the stability of the North American market"".  Remittances  are an application of bitcoin technology that has seen broad interest since the digital currency's launch, with its borderless nature and underlying software driving the exploration of ways to more conveniently send funds from one country or region to another. Bitso and Paycase are said to have been exploring this area for the past year.  However, factors such as the cost of compliance and resistance toward the digital currency on the part of banking institutions has, in some instances, stymied momentum for bitcoin-based remittance services. At the same time, some firms in the space have advanced their platforms amidst a difficult regulatory environment.

42379299,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX85Gtp,1489150831,How Bitcoin's P2P Layer Got a Speed Hike in the Latest Core Release,"“Satoshi left us with a monolithic blob of a codebase.”  That was bitcoin developer Cory Fields’ way of saying that, despite the innovation it’s often credited with, Bitcoin Core's code is kind of a mess behind the scenes.  It’s a problem Fields and others have been grappling with since at least 2015, when he presented his plans to move around one piece of the code: the peer-to-peer layer.  The problem developers often encounter is that the components are not all neatly separated. So, if developers change something that’s only supposed to impact one portion of bitcoin and how it functions, Fields said, it could unintentionally impact another, say, validation, mempool, the wallet, or p2p. For one, this makes it more difficult for newer bitcoin contributors to learn the ropes.  So, in projects such as Fields' and libconsensus (an ongoing project to allow alternative implementations to remain in consensus with the bitcoin network), the goal is to separate the code into more distinct chunks in an attempt to make it easier, and less necessary, for developers to understand how the pieces fit together.  Fields, whose work is funded by MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, has been working on breaking out the peer-to-peer codebase in particular.  Much of his work is making a first appearance in Bitcoin Core’s latest software release.  Fields told CoinDesk:  ""As far as I know, this is the first large-scale overhaul of the peer-to-peer code.""  He mentioned, however, that over time many developers, such as Jonas Schnelli and Matt Corallo, have contributed to the layer, and importantly many more have had a hand in reviewing and testing the changes.  The peer-to-peer layer deals with the connections between the thousands of bitcoin nodes on the network (maybe more than 50,000, though, exact counts are difficult to come by), which are constantly 'talking' to each other, passing information as users send bitcoins, or miners create new blocks.  Bug discovery  One tricky part is that the bitcoin network is valued at roughly $19bn, meaning changes to the underlying code have to be undertaken extremely carefully.  For that and other reasons, refactoring hasn’t been an easy process. Not even for Fields, who is one of the more active contributors to Bitcoin Core. (""I spend nearly all of my waking hours on bitcoin,"" he said.)  First, he tried to a separate layer from scratch. That effort ""failed miserably"".  His later approach of working to improve the existing codebase arguably worked better than expected though, leading to a “Satoshi-era” bug discovery.  “As I started to break things up, I noticed something odd about Core's bandwidth usage during initial block download,” Fields said.  The problem was that, when a node would download blocks from another node, the speed at which blocks were passed along would be sometimes fast, other times slow – and at unexpected levels.  Digging further, he and other developers determined that nodes would stubbornly refuse to send data and process data at the same time (though this is an oversimplification). The node would just do one process at a time.  Speed fix  The fix the team finally arrived at saw its debut in the recent Bitcoin Core code release, changing how quickly nodes can pass information to one another.  “In particular, the p2p layer gets a huge speedup,” Fields said.  He ran some tests to compare the last bitcoin version (0.13.2) with the new version with the improvements (0.14.0), looking at nodes that were deployed to the cloud on Amazon EC2 instances with two CPUs and 4GB of RAM.  The tests showed a doubling in speed – at least, when comparing the performance of sending data between two v0.13.2 nodes, versus between two v0.14.0 nodes.  The caveat here is that it might result in a bit less than a two-times performance improvement on the real network, according to Fields.  Lasting benefits  Now, the peer-to-peer layer is mostly separate from the rest.  It's worth repeating that, the above performance improvements aside, most of the changes aren’t ones that users will notice, but are more of a boon for developers.  That said, the hope is that they could have longer-term impact.  ""I'm hoping that allows us to improve p2p at a faster pace now,"" Fields said.  For example, it would have been more difficult to make the changes included in the latest version of Core if Fields had not already worked to isolate the code.  He said:  ”[T]here was a relatively simple change that could be made in time for 0.14 that would've been much more complicated before.”  Speed dial image via Shutterstock.

Developed by Blockstack, which raised $4m in funding earlier this year, the ultimate purpose of the platform is to leverage the bitcoin blockchain to build a more secure kind of internet without centralized servers, providing a dedicated browser that allows users to control their identities.  The platform also aims to simplify the process of setting up a bitcoin node by speeding up blockchain sync times. As Blockstack said in its statement, a new feature called FastSync has been implemented in the latest Blockstack Core version 0.14.1, the software now available on AWS.  According to Amazon, Blockstack is the third blockchain-related offering on their marketplace, in addition to Monax and Manifold Technology.  Unlike traditional bitcoin core client that downloads the complete blockchain – which is now over 100GB in size – Blockstack nodes fetch just the latest state, authenticated by Blockstack, from a remote node and uses that to sync with the network.  The startup recently released a blockchain explorer, dubbed the 'Blockstack Explorer', which gathers information about Blockstack's domain name network, into a visual display.

The Taiwan-based firm plans to use the money to create new implementations of the security in its wallet for use in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, the medical industry and other blockchain sectors where identity is paramount.  The founder and CEO of lead investor Kyber Capital positioned CoolBitX's Coolwallet technology as a more broadly applicable “decentralized security protocol”.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Thomas Hu said:  ""You can imagine this as an omnipotent hotel key card that can back up not only your personal credentials, but can serve as a payment token.""  CoolBitX secures its wallets with an embedded security device for securing private keys, as well as a complete signature authorization and verification mechanism that can be synchronized with a smartphone and CoolWallet’s own backup facility.  Offline pass phrases can also be used to recover lost or stolen hardware devices.  As possible evidence of industry interest in non-cryptocurrency related applications of CoolBitX’s security tech, Taiwan-based medical devices firm iMediPlus also participated in the round.  In a statement sent exclusively to CoinDesk, iMediPlus’s chief legal officer and intellectual property counsel, Matthew Lee, positioned the technology as a possible means to help prevent insurance fraud, among other broader applications in the healthcare industry.  “We are working with CoolBitX to turn CoolWallet into a secure passport for personal healthcare information and medical data backup storage,” Lee said in the statement.  Other investors include bitcoin mining firm Bitmain and Asia Pacific venture capital firm Midana Capital.  This is the most recent blockchain investment by Kyber Capital, which now boasts a portfolio of eight blockchain companies including Taiwan-based Amis, which is a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.  The growth of hardware  With part of the new investment, CoolBitX plans to develop a secure communication system that encrypts files on a smartphone, as well as implementing a decentralized bitcoin exchange.  But the investment is also part of a larger push in the blockchain industry by a number of companies looking to secure blockchain systems with hardware.  Last month, consultancy giant Accenture partnered with security firm Thales to reveal a hardware security module designed to give enterprises more confidence in securing access to their blockchain solutions. IBM also produces a similar hardware security module.  A business development plan for CoolBitX shown to CoinDesk reveals plans to issue co-branded wallets with 10 enterprise clients in Q2 of this year, followed by the development of a ""blockchain medical record"" using Coolwallet.  ""CoolWallet in this system encrypts medical data with its private keys,"" said Hu, ""and uses its HD [hierarchical deterministic] wallet architecture to offer different levels of accessibility to different institutions and staff.""  In conclusion, he said the expansion was actually part of an even broader play:  ""We see this as an extension to a more decentralized security protocol in various applications, whether its in medical, data security, and identity management.""
