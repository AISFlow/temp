The move to proof of stake will no doubt be a game-changer for the blockchain. So As the day for the merge draws closer, users of the network have been upping their activity in recent times.

42410890,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3AM,1647639486,What Is ApeCoin and Who Is Behind It?,"Earlier this week, it was announced that members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection would be getting their very own cryptocurrency, ApeCoin.  The passive voice there is intentional. ApeCoin is explicitly linked to these famously pricey non-fungible tokens, and is very much involved with Yuga Labs, the company stewarding the intellectual property behind the Bored Apes. But a carefully coordinated marketing campaign has taken great pains to dissociate ApeCoin from any one conventional corporation.  Read More: Bored Ape Yacht Club’s ApeCoin Surges 90% on Second Day of Trading  Instead, the public relations messaging insists ApeCoin is a product of ApeCoin DAO, a brand new organizational unit governed entirely by token holders. Holding APE makes you a member of the DAO (that’s short for decentralized autonomous organization, a kind of online collective centered around crypto); you don’t even need to own a Bored Ape NFT to join.  ApeCoin’s official website bills the token as “a decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse.”  Let’s decode some of that gibberish, shall we?  What is ApeCoin?  ApeCoin is an ERC-20 token, a particular flavor of build-it-yourself cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. Most of the Ethereum-based social tokens that have taken off over the past year (think FWB, for the social club Friends with Benefits, and WRITE, for the Web 3 crowdfunding platform Mirror) are built using this framework.  Unlike NFTs, they’re meant to be “fungible” – as with bitcoin (BTC), any one ApeCoin should be worth exactly as much as any other ApeCoin, and you can buy and sell them freely on what is known as a decentralized exchange, a kind of digital trading post for cryptocurrencies.  Almost every major centralized crypto exchange listed the token immediately after launch. This was an accomplishment in and of itself, given the notoriously finicky nature of major players like Coinbase (COIN). After just one day of trading, ApeCoin had a market capitalization of almost $2 billion; one APE is currently worth about $14 and the total supply of tokens is capped at one billion (not all of which is currently in circulation).  Who is behind ApeCoin?  According to the ApeCoin website and accompanying press materials, ApeCoin is being launched by ApeCoin DAO, a new governing body in which all APE holders are members. It’s meant to field proposals from the community, which token holders can then vote on.  Other NFT projects have attempted similar voting structures. Purchasing an NFT from a collection called “Nouns” makes you a member of Nouns DAO, an online investment collective that has amassed a treasury of $62 million. On a dedicated page for proposals, Nouns owners can decide as a group what they’d like to do with that money. (A typical proposal: “What if we made an NFT comic book?”)  There’s also a separate organization called the Ape Foundation, which will handle day-to-day DAO administration, proposal management and “other tasks that ensure the DAO community’s ideas have the support they need to become a reality.” It’s the legal backing for ApeCoin DAO.  An Ape Foundation subcommittee will also serve as ApeCoin DAO’s “board,” which will oversee certain proposals. The initial board consists of five high-profile crypto investors: Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian; Amy Wu, who leads the crypto exchange FTX’s venture arm; Maaria Bajwa, of Sound Ventures; Animoca Brands’ Yat Siu; and Dean Steinbeck of Horizen Labs. Each board member gets a six-month term, and the ApeCoin website promises DAO members will be able to vote on future members.  Floating somewhere in the middle of all this is a Cayman Islands-based consulting company called Cartan Group, which is being paid $150,000 per month for a six-month contract; all five of the DAO’s active AIPs, or “Ape Improvement Proposals,” were posted by Brian Tang, the company’s co-founder.  So, in addition to the ApeCoin protocol (the code behind ApeCoin tokens), there’s the ApeCoin DAO, the Ape Foundation and the ApeCoin DAO board.  But ApeCoin wasn’t developed by the community of Bored Ape investors. There’s a black hole at the center of this ape galaxy. Who actually put this thing together?  The main company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club is Yuga Labs, a traditional corporate entity registered in Delaware. It’s reportedly in talks with the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz about funding that would value it at $5 billion, and it has recently made moves to become, effectively, the first major NFT monopoly.  Read More: The First NFT Monopoly  Yuga Labs is also responsible for all the major projects and acquisitions surrounding the Bored Ape Yacht Club. If you want to do anything with Bored Ape IP, you’ll have to go through Yuga Labs.  In a statement, Yuga Labs CEO Nicole Muniz said that “Yuga Labs will continue to be builders of products and experiences that bring new ideas and energy to the community.” Yuga Labs has gifted a special one-of-one NFT to the ApeCoin DAO treasury, and plans to “adopt ApeCoin as the primary token for all new products and services,” which ties its value to the health of the Bored Ape collection as a whole.  Even still, Yuga Labs has insisted it’s not responsible for ApeCoin.  A press release, courtesy of a company called Strange Brew Strategies, warns journalists that “it’s probably tempting to write that ApeCoin is from the Bored Ape Yacht Club to simplify things, but it’s not accurate.”  Distribution and free money  The distribution model for ApeCoin further complicates that question of agency.  Sixty-two percent of the total ApeCoins are being set aside for token holders and the DAO treasury. For the first 90 days of ApeCoin’s existence, anyone who holds some combination of NFTs from the Bored Ape Yacht Club and its two spin-off collections, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club and the Bored Ape Kennel Club, can claim a certain amount of APE from ApeCoin’s website.  Because APE has a discrete value and is already trading on major exchanges, claiming these coins is a little like claiming free money. For each Bored Ape you own, you’re entitled to 10,094 APE. That’s around $150,000 at today’s prices – about half of what you’d need to buy yourself another Bored Ape.  So far, around 110 million APE tokens have been claimed by NFT holders (here’s a convenient dashboard for tracking APE tokenomics, courtesy of a Dune Analytics wizard called Hildobby).  The other 38% of ApeCoin is set aside for “initial contributors,” and also the Jane Goodall Legacy Foundation, which supports conservation efforts for (real-life) jungle primates.  Yuga Labs is getting 150 million APE, 10 million of which (“or equal value”) will go to the Jane Goodall Legacy Foundation. Next, 140 million APE goes to “the companies and people that helped make this project a reality” – an as yet unnamed group that most likely includes members of the Yuga Labs team. And 80 million APE goes to the founders of Yuga Labs. All these coins are “locked” for the first 12 months, so holders can’t just cash out and tank the price.  The “free money” token claim concept for NFTs isn’t a new one. Back in September, a developer launched a cryptocurrency called “Adventure Gold” (AGLD) as a companion to an ascendant NFT collection called Loot. Anyone with a Loot NFT was automatically entitled to a certain amount of AGLD, and claiming those tokens meant coming into tens of thousands of dollars without any extra effort. In this sense, an NFT can function as a license to print money.  Again, Yuga Labs claims zero responsibility for ApeCoin – it’s just taking a significant chunk of the profits.  Is this legal?  It hinges on the idea that ApeCoin DAO is entirely independent from Yuga Labs. If Yuga Labs issued a token explicitly as a reward for Bored Ape holders, you could more easily make the argument that a Bored Ape is a kind of investment, and therefore subject to securities regulations. In the way that certain stocks pay dividends, part of the value of investment-style NFTs would be tied to the perks they could get you down the line.  With ApeCoin ostensibly coming just from ApeCoin DAO and not from Yuga Labs, there’s a veneer of plausible deniability – an independent entity allocating tokens to a company and its founders, rather than that company and its founders pumping their own investments.  Of course, traditional companies do this all the time, via initial public offerings of stock. The difference is the ApeCoin offering is essentially unregulated because, in the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission still doesn’t oversee NFTs.  At least for now.  According to Rohan Grey, a law professor at Willamette University and crypto regulation observer, the distinction between ApeCoin DAO and Yuga Labs probably also has to do with something called the Hinman Test. It’s named for former SEC official William Hinman, who now works at Andreessen Horowitz; Hinman’s idea was that if a governing body is ""sufficiently decentralized,"" it’s free to issue a token without having to register it as a security. ApeCoin DAO is (at least nominally) decentralized; Yuga Labs is not.  “It's the next iteration of the crypto world’s attempts to get around securities regulation,” he said. “First of all it was coins, and then in 2017 with the [SEC’s] ICO report they couldn't do that, so they switched to stablecoins, and then there was a clamp-down on that, so they switched to NFTs.”  In Grey’s opinion, ApeCoin amounts to an attempt by the crypto industry “to almost relitigate 2017 – they were kicked out of the bar wearing a fake mustache, now they've come back with a fake nose in a week.”  OK, but what can I do with ApeCoin?  Right now, ApeCoin mostly exists for speculation and “governance” for the DAO. But Yuga Labs has grand ambitions for the token.  A mobile game called Benji Bananas, developed by Animoca Brands (whose co-founder, Yat Siu, is on the board of the Ape Foundation), is adopting ApeCoin as a kind of in-game currency. For 25 ApeCoins, you can buy a Benji Bananas Membership Pass, which lets you earn “special tokens” in-game. Those tokens can then be swapped for ApeCoins.  Presumably, this is only the beginning of a whole ecosystem powered by ApeCoin: Yuga Labs plans to use APE as its de facto currency for all new projects. That’s part of the legal element, too – the more you can do with the token, beyond speculation, the better your shot at evading the SEC.  If the price holds, and traders outside the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem start taking positions in APE, you can expect the use cases to, uh, evolve.

A bear market can be caused by a variety of events, including bursting market bubbles, a poor or lagging or sluggish economy, wars, geopolitical crises, pandemics, and significant paradigm shifts in the economy, such as changing to an internet economy. Another reason can be the isolation between NFTs and DeFi space. Let&apos;s see how NFTs can help revitalize the bearish DeFi cycle. Isolation between NFTs and the DeFi space Looking back, we can see that NFTs and DeFi protocols have worked separately in the past. However, the current bearish moves in the Defi market may be corrected by the widespread adoption of NFTs. This is because NFTs have the capacity to assign value to nearly any object. DeFi, on the other hand, aids in the unlocking of a certain asset&apos;s worth. When combined together, they can balance each others&apos; strengths and weaknesses and enhance their capabilities. Application of NFTs to the DeFi world NFTs help revolutionize the DeFi world because of the following reasons Allow for customizable and exact roles for the community members involved such as &apos;avatars&apos; in the Metaverse games and &apos;validators&apos; for any DeFi protocol/blockchain like Cardano.

It also has a unique address, just like a bank account. Depending on the coin, it may resemble this. It appears to be a completely random sequence of characters and numbers, but there is more to it. The first thing we need to figure out is how these things are manufactured. Anyone can create a new wallet by following a precise procedure to generate a public and private key pair. In the case of Bitcoin or Ethereum, this is accomplished by using an elliptical curve digital signature method. That&apos;s a mouthful, but the bottom line is that the process will generate a private key and a corresponding public key. These keys are mathematically related to one another. You can use the private key to generate the public key. However, you cannot convert a public key to a private key. These two keys now have a distinct function. The public key will serve as the address for your wallet, similar to your bank account number. And the private key is your way of verifying that you own the wallet and hence have the authority to spend the money contained within it. To summarize, public keys can be shared with anybody, whereas private keys must be kept confidential unless you want others to decide what you should do with your money. So far, everything is going well. But there are a few fascinating side consequences to this approach that I&apos;d like to mention.

42375085,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5RXd,1647635125,"Market Wrap: Ether Outperforms, Bitcoin Rises Above $42K","Most cryptocurrencies traded higher on Friday after a volatile week.  Ethereum (ETH) was the standout, climbing as much as 5% in the past 24 hours, just shy of $3,000 for the first time in two weeks. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC) rose above $42,000 and was up 3% over the same period.  Equities were also higher on Friday, while gold, a traditional safe haven asset, traded lower. The rebound in stocks and the outperformance of several alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) suggests a greater appetite for risk among investors.  But there is still the potential for greater price swings in the near term. ""Despite the risk-on week for crypto assets, we will likely encounter additional volatility in the near term. We remain optimistic that any dips for ETH and BTC are buying opportunities,"" Sean Farrell, vice president of digital asset strategy at FundStrat, wrote in a Friday email.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $42,243, +2.83%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,981, +4.80%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,463, +1.17%    ●Gold: $1,920 per troy ounce, −1.16%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.15%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin's trading volume across exchanges continued to decline after the spike on Wednesday. Further, the volume of buy orders versus sell orders in the futures market was balanced on Friday, which could mean the current upswing in price lacks conviction.  The average funding rate, or the cost of holding long BTC positions in the perpetual futures listed on major exchanges in the perpetual swaps market, ticked higher, possibly reflecting bullish sentiment.  In other news, the Bored Ape Yacht Club-linked ApeCoin (APE) was up 90% on its second day of trading, rebounding to over $15 after lows of $6.48 on Thursday. That's a strong rebound from an 80% decline on Thursday.  Ether bounces on merge progress  Ether's rise is partly due to progress on the merge of the Ethereum blockchain's mainnet with the Beacon Chain.  Earlier this week, Ethereum merged on the Kiln testnet ahead of the blockchain's eventual move to a proof-of-stake network, with network validators now producing post-merge blocks containing transactions, CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa wrote (read more here).  ""We have seen a corresponding increase in the number of active validators on the Beacon Chain from 300,702 at the end of February to 315,576 as of March 17. That’s a 4.9% increase in just 17 days compared to 3.9% during the full month of February or 4.8% during the full month of January,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, wrote in a Friday newsletter.  From a technical perspective, the rise in ether has outpaced bitcoin, which could see further upside over the short term. The ETH/BTC price ratio held support at 0.064 and faces resistance at 0.073, which is roughly 4% away.  On the flip side, analysts also noticed slowing activity on the Ethereum network.  The chart below shows the recent decline in total transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, which means miners are paid less.  One reason behind the slowdown is a reduction in demand for expensive non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are predominantly minted and traded on the Ethereum network, according to FundStrat's Farrell, who also noted that Google search interest for NFTs peaked in mid-January.  Farrell also highlighted a sharp rise in ETH's a price-to-sales multiple, which is now above 50 compared with 17 a few months ago – a significant jump that could signal a frothy market.  Altcoin roundup  ApeCoin Rebound: The ApeCoin's surge on Friday gives the token a $3.8 billion market cap, making it the 33rd-largest coin, according to CoinMarketCap. CoinGecko lists it at 66th with a market cap of $1.7 billion. Read more here.  DeFi 'Super App': Polkadot-based lending protocol Parallel Finance is trying to become a one-stop shop for all corners of decentralized finance (DeFi). That effort accelerated Friday with the initial launch of six products spanning the DeFi spectrum from wallets to staking. “Overall, we’re building a ’super app,’ an end-to-end DeFi platform for Polkadot to start,” founder Yubo Ruan told CoinDesk in an interview. Read more from CoinDesk's Danny Nelson, here.  Altcoin volume update: ""BTC continues to be the dominant asset traded by our consumer client base,"" Coinbase wrote in a newsletter. BTC volumes represent an overwhelming 32.1% of volumes traded, although large market cap tokens such as AVAX, SOL, LUNA and ADA have seen a pickup in trading activity following price increases. Coinbase also noticed some hedge funds buying into the recent price bounce, while others used the opportunity to reduce risk.

42411474,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONVS,1647631515,"Without Robots, DAOs Will Never Progress Beyond Their Current Level","Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are already changing the world by allowing large groups of people to make decisions autonomously. Enabled by blockchain technology, which is itself life-changing, these groups are eliminating the need for centralized management teams that have traditionally set strategy and overseen all areas of public- and private-sector organizations.  Marcello Mari is CEO of SingularityDAO, an independent project incubated by SingularityNET that combines decentralized finance and artificial intelligence, and provides AI-powered portfolio management for the crypto space.  But DAOs may themselves be in for a change that could fix perhaps their most significant vulnerability. The current DAO model is human-run, and as a result, DAO decisions are prone to errors in judgment. The use of artificial intelligence, another transformative technology, would eliminate those mistakes and make DAOs even more effective.  What are DAOs?  A DAO is an organization guided by rules encoded as a transparent computer program. DAOs are controlled by their organizations' members and are decentralized (well, semi-decentralized in their current form). As the rules of the organizations are embedded into the codes, no managers are required. DAOs eliminate the bureaucracy and hierarchy hurdles present in traditional organizations.  The rise of DAOs can be attributed to one question that internet users have been asking for years: “How can we exchange values in a trusted environment?” The emergence of blockchain technology enables automated trusted transactions and value exchanges, allowing internet users globally to organize themselves in a safe, effective way to achieve common goals.  The financial transactions and rules of DAOs are recorded on the blockchain, eliminating the need to involve third-party entities and simplifying the transactions via smart contracts.  DAOs employ governance tokens, which tend to be used to provide holders with voting rights. In most cases, these tokens give holders the ability to participate in the decentralized governance of protocols, or even in the governance of the tokens themselves.  The Rise of DAOs  We can describe 2021 as the year that DAOs reached wide-scale public awareness. In previous years, DAOs had served several purposes, including investment, charity and fundraising, but all on a smaller scale.  With last year’s massive growth, DAOs now collectively have about a million members. According to ConsenSys, the leading 20 DAOs combined hold over $14 billion in digital assets. And the expansion is not limited to major DeFi players such as Compound and MakerDAO. Smaller DAOs have emerged and are on the rise. One of the most popular DAOs last year was ConstitutionDAO, which raised roughly $47 million in less than a week in a bid to acquire a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution.  While the group fell short of that objective, the big splash it made in mainstream media signified that such projects – and even bigger ones – will surface in coming years. ConstitutionDAO showed that DAOs could transform many different industries, even if some people questioned whether it was a DAO or temporary fundraising mechanism to acquire the historic document. ConstitutionDAO had just that single objective and hasn't made any decisions subsequently.  DAOs are also having an impact on the music industry. Last May, JennyDAO acquired its first NFT – an original song by Steve Aoki and 3LAU. JennyDAO is a metaverse group that provides fractional ownerships of non-fungible tokens. Unlike the case with ConstitutionDAO, members decide which NFTs to acquire. Smart contracts from the Unicly platform control the vault where the NFTs are to be added.  Growth Trajectory  This year may be an even bigger year for DAOs in participation and the staggering sums of money they are likely to raise. The growth of the DAO approach has begun to obviate traditional approaches to finance, medicine, art and the law, among other areas. (Note that many DAOs are not fundraisers, as many people mistakenly believe.)  DAOs will also solve diversity issues by ensuring that people from all over the world can participate in the decision-making process of several projects simultaneously, and they will increasingly serve as a tool to govern the decentralized landscape over the coming months.  Turning to robots  Robots offer a path forward. Despite their spectacular rise, DAOs continue to suffer from human errors that could hinder them from achieving their full potential.  Artificial general intelligence (AGI) could offer a better path forward by executing tasks on behalf of individuals in a DAO. AGI would combine human-like, flexible thinking and reasoning with split-second number crunching and other computational advantages to make better decisions.  Ultimately, the goal of a DAO is to function without human hierarchical management. With AI DAOs, a community of human participants would choose AI agents to represent them in the decision-making process, eliminating human bias. The AI agents would then work together autonomously to make the best decisions about creating their own products and services, selling them and transferring the profits to human participants.  Many DAOs will likely shift to this improved model in the months and years ahead while continuing to benefit from blockchain and other emerging technologies. In the future, many DAOs will likely shift from full human control of functions to automation. The DAOs would then be able to take full advantage of AI, blockchain and other emerging technologies to make them even more efficient.  AI DAOs would also have cost benefits by removing human bias and errors. They would become truly autonomous organisms, fulfilling the original DAO vision of creating a better way of doing business.

42375076,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5RMJ,1647631171,El Salvador’s Bitcoin Bond Issuance Apparently Delayed,"El Salvador’s $1 billion in so-called ""volcano bonds"" have yet to hit the market, with volatile international conditions likely a key culprit in the delay.  Last week, El Salvador Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya - who previously said the bond sale could come between March 15 and March 20 - noted the war between Ukraine and Russia could slow the process. “We have the tools almost finished, but the international context will tell us,” he told a local TV station.  Indeed, while legislators in El Salvador still had work to do regarding the bonds, lawmakers over the past week or two have instead been preoccupied with the repercussions - supply chain shocks among them - of the Ukraine war. As of March 15, the laws necessary for the bonds had not been sent to Congress, according to a report from local newspaper La Prensa Gráfica.  In November 2021, President Nayib Bukele announced plans to build a “Bitcoin City” funded by the sale of the bonds, which have an annual coupon of 6.5%. Half of the funds will be used to accumulate bitcoin (BTC), with the rest earmarked for infrastructure and bitcoin mining powered by geothermal energy.

42420997,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAqhZ,1647628637,Andrew Yang Wants Web 3 to Prove the Haters Wrong,"After two spirited bids for elected office (a long-shot run for Democratic Presidential nominee, followed by an unsuccessful bid for New York City mayor), Andrew Yang now finds himself Web 3’s newest poster child, perhaps becoming the highest-profile politician to embrace the cause.  Yang’s dive down the crypto rabbit hole is not exactly surprising. It’s hard to ignore the parallels between Yang’s culty supporters (known as the “Yang Gang”) and the similarly zealous coalition crypto has amassed. Namely, both have appealed to a type of predominantly young, white, male and meme-loving technologist who fantasizes about disrupting legacy institutions – for the former, it’s Washington politics, and for the latter, it’s Wall Street banks.  “I’m someone who just wants to build as quickly as possible,” Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, told CoinDesk in an interview on Thursday.  While Yang is not exactly building cutting-edge zk-rollups or ponzi-esque DeFi protocols, he has recently staked his name and reputation behind two decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Last month, Yang revealed Lobby3, a DAO aimed at Web 3-pilling Washington politicians by policy advocacy and educational initiatives.  Now, on the one-year anniversary of the Atlanta spa shooting that killed six Asian Americans, Yang has unveiled GoldenDAO, an organization he says will champion Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) issues and also sell non-fungible token (NFT) memberships priced north of $3,000 each.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Yang talks about how he plans to build a coalition via GoldenDAO, reflections on his Asian-American identity, his newfound fascination with “liquid governance” and how the cryptocurrency industry can win over Washington, D.C.  This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.  CoinDesk: Andrew, most readers know you from the Democratic primaries or the New York City mayoral election, both heavily in the realm of politics. What first piqued your interest in crypto?  Andrew Yang: When I was running for president, one of the first communities to embrace my campaign was the crypto community. I think it’s because the people in Web 3 have a sense of optimism about the future and they know we’re going to need to do things differently.  I also have a lot of friends who are deeply involved, so I’ve spoken at a couple of conferences and have gotten to know more and more people, but my first real connection was during my Presidential campaign early on in 2018. I remember friends telling me about Bitcoin years and years ago, so I’ve been aware of it for some time.  Let’s chat about your new project GoldenDAO. It's a decentralized autonomous organization that’s looking to tackle Asian issues. What’s your relationship with your own Asian identity, and did that in any way inspire GoldenDAO?  Yang: It’s been a very difficult time for so many people the last couple of years, but I do think that Asian Amerians have felt a higher level of a need to come together. I’m the son of immigrants, so growing up in the ‘70s and ‘80s I always had a very acute sense of both appreciation for the U.S. but also a struggle to belong. I think it’s something that a lot of Asian Americans can relate to.  GoldenDAO was inspired in large part by friends and family of mine who said, “We should try to galvanize more people to address issues that are important to the [Asian] community.” Being someone who is one of the more visible members of the community, I thought I should do what I could to provide that.  Especially during the pandemic, we’ve seen an uptick in violence against Asians. GoldenDAO mentions Asian hate, social injustice, mental wellness and Asian representation as some of the key issues that need addressing. How does GoldenDAO plan to do this?  Yang: One of the virtues of a DAO is that it’s going to be up to the community to decide how to invest time, energy and resources. But our hope is that members of the community will get excited about various projects and then put in time both through the DAO and as also perhaps as individuals. For example, if there’s a public awareness campaign, or mental health initiative, then the members of the DAO can invest part of the treasury in augmenting or amplifying that effort, and then come together to help it in a myriad of ways. You can use a DAO structure to express the popular will as to what efforts or initiatives to get behind.  It’s also kind of the first time we’re seeing a DAO structure being used for social activism. What do you think are the benefits of a DAO vs. traditional affinity group or non-profit?  Yang: I think DAOs are wonderful in their potential to activate a large number of people, but also have the organization be directed by different people at different times. It reminds me of a lot of projects that we’ve all been involved with where the energy tends to gather around the person that puts in the most.  I think a DAO could be an ideal expression of that – if there are members of the community that are particularly animated about a cause or project, and they can make the case, it could be a month later that different leaders emerge. One of the great struggles of the times is, “What does effective governance look like in the 21st century?” We have various political institutions that are not keeping up with the times. So I’m excited about the potential of a DAO to activate our community in whole new ways.  Last month you unveiled Lobby3, another DAO you founded with the goal of lobbying Washington on Web 3 issues. Is GoldenDAO trying to do the same thing, but for AAPI-related issues?  Yang: Lobby3 is meant to provide both an inside and outside effort to helping educate lawmakers on the potential of Web 3 technologies to broadly improve people’s lives, whereas GoldenDAO is focused on issues that affect the AAPI community. I think that you want things to be able to take advantage of DAO structure but also maintain flexibility.  Lobby3 and GoldenDAO are going to be embarking on different types of activities because the problems they are trying to solve are, to me, very distinct.  There’s a feeling in crypto that DAOs are great at marketing an aspirational cause and are effective in raising money [like buying the Constitution], but they often fall short in achieving the goal. Looking at the mint prices for GoldenDAO’s NFTs, the collection could raise up to $9 million dollars if it sells out. What would you say to the skeptics that think this could be a “rug”?  Yang: One of the virtues of this structure is that it’s transparent, so people will see where the resources go. Certainly, I know that there’s plenty of work to do, and as we get resources in, we will be investing it in a way that the community sees fit. Everyone who is involved in GoldenDAO is very mission-driven and excited to demonstrate what these tools can do in the hands of this community.  DAOs can be a transformative force for governance and a different way to activate people. It’s up to us to make these things what we want to see in the world.  You’re probably the highest-profile politician to come out and fully embrace Web 3. What are other ideas you have in the pipeline as it relates to Web 3 and politics?  Yang: Certainly right now, these two missions will strike everyone as both obvious and important. Trying to make sure that the rules and regulations over the next weeks and months effectively balance mitigating risk and supporting innovation and the development of new American jobs. And then trying to address some of the problems and issues that the AAPI community is facing but also elevanting builders and creators that want to do positive things. I’m sure I’ll be doing more in Web 3, but these two missions are plenty for now.  There will be other opportunities coming down the pipe. One of the joys of being in Web 3 is that you get to meet so many entrepreneurs that are building awesome things. I’m someone that gets excited about great ideas.  Should we expect an Andrew Yang DAO hat-trick?  Yang: I do like to operate in threes, but right now people are very excited about Lobby3 and GoldenDAO, and I am too.  What’s something interesting in Web 3 that you’re currently most excited about?  Yang: I have friends in Web 3 pushing me on liquid democracy, and people being able to essentially have other people vote on their behalf for different types of issues, which I think is an intriguing idea. I would contrast what’s happening in Web 3 with what’s happening in the American political system, where you have this ossified set of bureaucracies that people are losing confidence in.  My goal is to demonstrate to people what can be done when you have the right group of people using cutting-edge tools, in part to demonstrate that we should expect better. But I’m also someone who just wants to build as quickly as possible so we can open more people’s eyes.  Many people in crypto are now becoming really interested in politics and how to best advance crypto-related issues in Congress. Is there anything the crypto industry could be doing better to get Washington more interested in collaborating?  Yang: In Washington, D.C., the messenger counts as much as the message. That’s something I think that Web 3 should adjust and adapt to. What’s funny is the folks I know in Web 3 tend to be very, very rational and efficient. The problem is that Washington would not readily be described as any of those things. So it requires a bit of calibration. It’s an environment where relationships matter a great deal, where having access to a certain set of individuals has an enormous market.  There are ways to improve the climate, there are ways that we can solve the problems that many political figures publicly proclaim their passion for solving. If we can demonstrate that these tools are a force for good and can improve people’s lives in a way that political figures regularly support, then we can see to it that the environment remains one where America can be the hub for a lot of this energy and human capital and innovation that we all believe is possible.  Imagine an anti-poverty implementation of digital wallets in a poor neighborhood that right now is being exploited by moneylenders and pawn shops. If you can show, “Look, we’ve given rise to a different way for people to access buying power and financial services,” that’s the kind of thing that a lot of people want to see, and we can do it.  How do you view crypto, personally?  Yang: Crypto is like a lot of other things – it’s what you make of it. People talk about “DAOs this, DAOs that.” The fact is if you get the right group of people together, DAOs can be a transformative force for governance and a different way to activate people. It’s up to us to make these things what we want to see in the world.  If we succeed in that, then other people will see the same things. Right now, there are a lot of folks that are somewhat skeptical or dubious, it’s up to us to open up and if we do open up, I think we will open up a lot of people’s hearts and minds.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/18/andrew-yang-wants-web-3-to-prove-the-haters-wrong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a54ac916920a9b507191f0d41ac3d846da37ea52-4662x3108.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411483,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONzD,1647625150,Why Is the IMF So Afraid of Cryptocurrency?,"It seems increasingly clear that opposition to cryptocurrency can be considered an official position of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and we can expect anti-crypto restrictions to become a common condition of its loans to economies in crisis.  Most recently, Argentina has agreed to “discourage” the use of cryptocurrency as a condition of a $45 billion loan from the IMF. The announcement comes less than a year after El Salvador’s plan to use bitcoin as legal tender met with vocal complaints from the IMF ahead of negotiations on a loan with that country.  Argentina has been mired in a dire economic crisis for years, with fallout including high inflation. The country also carries huge sovereign debt and has a history of default, making borrowing on conventional markets more difficult.  Meanwhile, as laid out by The Block, Buenos Aires has become a significant center of blockchain and crypto development, substantially because the country’s economic and monetary chaos has pushed residents to seek the relative stability and trustworthiness of crypto like bitcoin. Crypto companies and organizations in the country are still reportedly seeking clarity on what exactly it would mean for their government to “discourage” the use of crypto.  But if Argentines have decided that crypto is a useful way for them to individually cope with economic chaos, why is the IMF trying to stop them?  The IMF’s real purpose  To understand what’s going on here, you have to understand the political history and true purpose of the IMF.  The agency was founded in 1944, in what the official narrative describes as an attempt to “avoid repeating the competitive currency devaluations that contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s.”  Sharp eyes will notice some sleight of hand here. The Great Depression largely ended by the mid-1930s, and the early 1940s were marked by something much more pressing than a hypothetical repeat: World War II. In reality, the IMF was founded less as a response to the Depression than as preparation for the end of the war and the reconstruction of Europe.  And that reconstruction was not philanthropic, but a strategic pillar of the then-emerging Cold War. Four years after the founding of the IMF, the U.S. Marshall Planhttps://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/short-history/Truman sent huge amounts of American capital to help Europe recover from the war – and, equally important, to make sure they recovered as part of the Western liberal-democratic order, rather than in the orbit of the Soviet Union.  The Marshall Plan became something of a blueprint for the economic front of the Cold War, and the International Monetary Fund became the mechanism for letting a hundred Marshall Plans bloom across the globe. Its presence in developing nations over the next half-century was in large part meant to forestall the spread of Communism. In exchange for its funds, IMF member states have generally had to comply with a variety of market reforms that connect them more deeply to the free-market Western order.  Those conditions can include wage cuts for public sector workers, the reduction of public pensions, the cutting of social programs, policies that favor privatization of public services, the abandonment of industrial policy and the opening of capital markets. The average IMF loan comes with 20 such conditions.  This IMF austerity program is often imposed on countries in the midst of crisis, making the reforms essentially a form of extortion under compulsion, or what American political commentator Naomi Klein has called “The Shock Doctrine.” And while they are advertised as “reform” measures intended to “fix” developing economies, they have just as often led to even deeper misery.  Klein and others have argued that this makes the IMF fundamentally a stalking horse for global corporations seeking free-market reforms, using countries’ economic desperation as leverage for imposing policies that allow greater economic extraction.  The collapse of the Soviet Union might seem to make the IMF less important, but much like NATO itself, the IMF has continued to pursue its fight against an absent enemy. How does an anti-communist organization behave once communism has been defeated? Apparently, much like a cult member whose chosen prophecy fails, it doubles down: a 2014 study found that the number of conditions attached to IMF loans had actually increased since the end of the Cold War.  This context suggests why the IMF is so aggressively anti-crypto: Because at the highest level, its reason for existence is not to boost developing economies or help the individuals who live within them. The IMF is not a neutral aid organization, but the economic arm of a vast power structure that frequently hides itself behind the language of uplift and reform. It seeks to draw peripheral or developing nations – African and Latin American countries being a current high priority – into the postwar neoliberal consensus.  Crypto threatens that power, even if the threat is somewhat distant for now. Mark Weisbrot, writing at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, describes the IMF as a “gatekeeper” for a “creditors’ cartel” of Western funders also including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.  But as El Salvador is attempting to demonstrate with its Volcano Bond, and as donations to Ukraine have recently shown even more dramatically, cryptocurrency is not easy to gatekeep. It seems very plausible that smaller nations such as El Salvador will before long have access to a parallel crypto-based debt and financing market over which the Western order has only tenuous influence.  That market will certainly be small relative to the overall global banking system, but even a small financial escape hatch could provide meaningful leverage for pushing back against the IMF and its power-driven agenda. The IMF’s own actions suggest they foresee that possibility – and they’re scared to death of it.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,David Z.

42375084,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5RWN,1647625111,Ukraine Crypto Exchange Founder Accuses Binance of 'Cooperating' With the Russian Government,"Ukrainian crypto exchange KUNA founder Michael Chobanian claims the Binance crypto exchange is working with the Russian government despite global sanctions, and has been for some time.  During an interview Friday on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover,"" Chobanian said CEO Changpeng Zhao must decide on where Binance stands in dealing with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in late February.  ""The problem with Binance is not just that they still continue working on both sides, it's that they showed cooperation with the Russian government before the war, and as far as I know, they still continue cooperating with the Russian government,"" Chobanian said.  Binance, the biggest crypto exchange worldwide by volume, told CoinDesk in February it had no plans to unilaterally ban Russian users from the platform, but that it would take actions against those who have had sanctions levied against them.  Jessica Jung, a Binance spokesperson, said, ""We prefer not to comment on false accusations. Our focus is on helping people."" She also quoted from a press release announcing Binance's $10 million donation and the launch of a crowdfunding site called the Ukraine Emergency Relief Fund.  Chobanian offered no proof that Binance is actively working with the Russian government, but the Russian market has long been an important one for Binance.  In 2019, Zhao called Russia ""our key market,"" and that ""we are always looking for partners in any community, especially in Russia."" In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Zhao said financial sanctions are not a ""crypto-specific issue,"" and that blocking all Russians from the crypto exchange would be ""unethical.""  On the other hand, Russian authorities have sent mixed signals about crypto, with the central bank advocating a ban but the government proposing to regulate it instead.  Chobanian, who is also the president of the Blockchain Association of Ukraine, appeared before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on Thursday for a hearing on ""The Role of Digital Assets in Illicit Finance."" During that hearing, he accused Binance of not taking an aggressive enough stance against the Russian government.  ""The first thing we did as a crypto community in Ukraine was to shut down all ruble operations because that was a big hole in the sanctions list. … Unfortunately, not all crypto companies followed our lead, mainly Binance,"" he said during the hearing. He added that crypto may be a useful lifeline for Russians who oppose the war and are trying to leave their country.  ""The only way for them to exist outside of Russia right now is crypto, probably. Obviously, not being able to buy a house or a car, but at least you can survive,"" he said.  Chobanian also said Binance has yet to make the $10 million donation it promised in a statement in February. Binance said then it would send the money to Ukrainian intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for humanitarian relief.  ""They said that they donated $10 million to the Ukrainian government. Well, I haven't seen that $10 million. No one knows where that went,"" he said.  In a blog post, Binance cites specific NGOs to which it says it donated. According to transaction details on its website, Binance has so far donated $2.5 million worth of Binance USD (BUSD) and $401,566 worth of Binance coin (BNB).

42411480,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONsb,1647622197,From Pariah to Partner: Crypto's Climate Answers,"A tiny seed of awareness seems to be taking root among policymakers and the public at large, a realization that cryptocurrencies might not be the environmental death knell their critics harp on about.  This week saw the narrow failure of a move to ban energy-intensive proof-of-work mining in the European Parliament (EP). That came after last week’s executive order from President Biden on blockchain and cryptocurrencies technologies, which, among other edicts, called for U.S. agencies to produce a report on “the potential for these technologies to impede or advance efforts to tackle climate change at home and abroad” and on “the impacts [they] have on the environment.”  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  These two political developments reflect core foundational shifts in thinking that could pave the way for the crypto community to take an important place in global efforts to curb climate change.  Firstly, there’s an emerging recognition that, whether people like them or not, these new, essentially unstoppable systems are not going away. Many EP members who’d considered supporting the so-called “Bitcoin ban” likely didn’t, not because of some great appreciation for cryptocurrencies but because they recognized it was futile. They understood that, if prohibited from operating in the European Union, miners would simply move to other regions with far dirtier fuel sources than those of the EU.  Beyond that begrudging acceptance, there are also signs of a wider, more positive interest in crypto’s potential to drive climate positive outcomes.  Biden’s EO called for a report analyzing “potential uses of blockchain that could support monitoring or mitigating technologies to climate impacts,” and the “implications for energy policy, including as it relates to grid management and reliability, energy efficiency incentives and standards, and sources of energy supply.”  As I’ve discussed previously, I believe energy policymakers should start to treat bitcoin miners as partners, not enemies. With calibrated tax and subsidy models, private-public pacts geared toward infrastructure development, and compensation contracts that commit miners to power down their machines during peak demand, mining capacity expansion projects can help communities fund and develop smart, renewables-based electricity grids. It’s heartening to see the highest office in the land alluding to such ideas, even if obliquely.  A more sophisticated conversation  I was also struck by the quality of the conversation around blockchain’s potential contribution to environment, social and governance (ESG) sustainability objectives during the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin these past few days. (A few CoinDeskers were there to participate and cover the conference and satellite events and to scope out the setting for our Consensus festival in the same city June 9-12, which will also include an ESG sub-conference.)  Presentations at Protocol Labs’ Sustainable Blockchain Summit delved into the increasingly sophisticated blockchain mechanisms for tackling climate change challenges. One SXSW official panel addressed “decarbonizing blockchain” and another looked at the “intersection of NFTs, block chain, DAO, DeFi with art, media, games, digital properties, brands, and how social movements, environmental impact, and nonprofits can capitalize on the trend for social good.”  These were not utopian “blockchain fixes everything” discussions, but serious conversations about the potential and challenges associated with this technology in use cases such as supply-chain carbon emission tracing and certifying and trading renewable energy. Alan Ransil, lead researcher for Filecoin Green at Protocol Labs, argued that these kinds of real-time solutions, with “programmable money,” offer an urgent upgrade to the existing “fiat system’s” laboriously slow measurement and response mechanisms. The world can’t afford to work off 1-year-old carbon audits, with information that’s too little too late.  Some speakers at the Protocol Labs’ event highlighted Toucan Protocol’s moves to bring carbon credits on-chain in the form of tradable tokens. But they also discussed the need to get beyond that voluntary market, which as my colleague Daniel Kuhn pointed out last November, does not actively halt CO2 emissions. There’s a need for real net-reduction strategies.  One of many interesting examples of the latter is found in GainForest, which was present at SXSW. That project, which won the Hack4Climate hackathon at the United Nations COP23 conference in Bonn, Germany, in November 2017, is working with indigenous communities in rain forest areas. It uses smart contracts to forge proactive incentive systems that tie the distribution of grant money to reforestation objectives.  In parallel to their efforts to achieve climate objectives, such projects are now also taking high-profile steps to mitigate what might be called blockchain technology’s environmental Achilles' heel: its own carbon footprint. GainForest recently moved from Ethereum, which relies on energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus, to Solana, which is based on a less computationally heavy proof-of-stake algorithm. And Metagood, an NFTs-for-good platform that raises money for causes such as the preservation of coral reefs in the Bahamas, uses cutting-edge processes to mint thousands of NFTs within a single transaction, reducing the computational load and the Ethereum gas fees for charities.  For more on the various efforts to reduce blockchain technology’s environmental externalities, read Ian Allison’s review of some of the leading ideas.

42394546,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBXmf,1647621790,How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?,"Key Takeaways:  Bitcoin mining is the process of discovering new blocks, verifying transactions and adding them to the Bitcoin blockchain.  Each time a new block is discovered, the successful miner is granted the right to fill that block with new transaction data.  In return for dedicating time and resources to performing this task, winning miners receive a free amount of newly minted bitcoin known as a “block reward” as well as any fees attached to transactions they store in the new blocks.  The process of giving successful miners newly minted bitcoin is exclusively how new coins enter circulation.  Why mine bitcoin?  There are two primary reasons why a person, or company, would want to mine cryptocurrency like bitcoin.  To stand a chance of earning bitcoin block rewards (which, as of April 2023, equals 6.25 bitcoins –approximately $177,000.) New blocks are roughly discovered once every 10 minutes.  To participate in securing and maintaining the decentralized Bitcoin network.  How do bitcoin miners discover new blocks?  In order to validate and add new transactions to the blockchain, miners must compete with each other using specialized computing equipment. They use their equipment to generate fixed-length codes known as “hashes” (see below.) In order to discover the next block, miners must generate a hash that has an equal or higher number of zeros in front of it than the “target hash.”  The target hash is a 64-digit hexadecimal code (comprising numbers 0-9 and letters A-F) all miners are trying to get below in order to discover the next block.  As a starting point, all miners take the data from the previous block, known as the “block header”– which contains things like a timestamp of the block, the hash of the previous block data, and an empty space known as a “cryptographic nonce.” Most of the data in the block header is fixed, meaning it cannot be changed, apart from the nonce. A nonce means “a number only used once” and is the part of the previous block header that miners are allowed to tweak. Remember, just changing a single bit of the input produces a totally different hash.  The tricky part is, hashes are generated completely at random, meaning it’s impossible for miners to know what the hashes will be before they generate them. So it’s simply a case of trial and error until someone finds the right nonce value – known as the “golden nonce.”  This is why miners have to invest in energy-intensive computers, particularly application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, that can generate trillions of hashes per second.  An easy way to think of bitcoin mining is to imagine each new block is a treasure chest with a combination lock on it. To get the free bitcoin block reward inside and win the right to add new transaction data into it (and collect the associated fees) you have to keep turning one of the number wheels on the lock (the nonce) until you crack the combination (the target hash.)  Here’s an example of what a target hash might look like:  0000000000000000057fcc708cf0130d95e27c5819203e9f967ac56e4df598ee  To see just how difficult it is to generate a hash with more zeros at the front than the above target hash, try creating a winning hash yourself with this free online hash generator. Simply type anything you want in the text box provided and see if it produces a hash with more than 17 zeros at the front!  What is a hash?  A hash is a cryptographic mathematical function that converts any message or data input into a fixed-length code. Think of it as an encryption technique where messages are mathematically transposed into a sequence of numbers and letters of a fixed length.  The outputs have set lengths to make it impossible to guess the size of the input. For instance, the hash for the word “hi” would be exactly the same length as the hash of the entire text of a Harry Potter book.  These hash functions are irreversible, meaning that it’s impossible to revert the hash back to its original input. The same input will also always generate the same sequence of letters and numbers. For example, the hash of “hi” will be the same code every time. Each code generated is completely unique too, meaning it’s impossible to produce the same hash with two different inputs.  In the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain uses Secure Hash Algorithm 256 or SHA 256 to generate a 256 bit or 64 characters long output, regardless of the size of the input.  How rewarding is bitcoin mining?  For every new block added to the blockchain, the protocol – a set of rules programmed into Bitcoin – releases a fixed amount of newly minted coins to the successful miner. This block reward system doubles as the distribution mechanism for Bitcoin.  As part of the programmed measures introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto to steadily decrease the number of bitcoins released over time, the coins awarded to miners are slashed roughly every four years, or 210,000 blocks, in a process known as a “Bitcoin Halving.” In 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. This figure was reduced to 25 BTC in 2013. The most recent halving occurred in 2020, and saw block rewards fall from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.  Note that bitcoin has a 21 million maximum supply cap, and we already have 18.9 million coins in circulation. Block rewards will no longer be distributed once 21 million BTC has been released to the market. Once this happens, miners will only be able to earn rewards in the form of bitcoin transaction fees.  Read More: What Happens When All Bitcoin Are Mined?  Even with this combination of two revenue sources, not every miner generates profits. To make ends meet, a miner’s earnings must exceed the amount spent on electricity and the purchase and maintenance of mining rigs. Also, as mining difficulty increases, large mining operations are forced to expand or upgrade their equipment to maintain a competitive edge. For most average miners who cannot afford to invest in expensive equipment, there’s an opportunity to combine their resources with other miners around the world. Each miner agrees to share rewards according to the contributions of each miner. These networks of miners are called “mining pools.”  There are, however, some rare instances where solo miners have successfully mined blocks on their own from home.  Bitcoin mining difficulty  An important thing to know about Bitcoin is that when Satoshi Nakamoto created the protocol, they programmed in a target block discovery time of 10 minutes. This means it should take approximately 10 minutes for a miner to successfully create the winning code to discover the next block.  So how does the network ensure new blocks are discovered every 10 minutes?  The Bitcoin protocol has the ability to automatically increase or decrease the complexity of the mining process depending on how quickly or slowly blocks are being found.  Every two weeks, the Bitcoin protocol automatically adjusts the target hash to make it harder or easier for miners to find blocks. If they are taking too long (more than 10 minutes) the difficulty will adjust downward; less than 10 minutes, it will adjust upward. More specifically, the protocol will increase or decrease the number of zeros at the front. This might not sound like much, but just adding a single zero to the target hash makes the code significantly harder to beat, and vice versa.  The 2021 crackdown on mining activities in China caused bitcoin’s network difficulty to experience its biggest drop in history. This subsequently led to remaining bitcoin miners reporting significant rises in mining revenue.  Through this system, the Bitcoin protocol is able to keep block discovery times as close to 10 minutes as it can. You can track the mining difficulty of Bitcoin here.  Read More: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty: Everything You Need to Know  While actively participating in the Bitcoin network can be a highly rewarding venture, the electricity and hardware requirements often limit its profitability – particularly for miners with limited resources.  Why does bitcoin mining use so much energy?  One of the biggest drawbacks of Bitcoin is the vast amount of energy it uses to mine new coins, validate transactions and secure its network. At press time, Bitcoin's hash rate – the measure of all computational power dedicated to mining new coins – stands at 183 exahash (Eh/s.) This means bitcoin miners collectively attempt to crack the target hash of the next new block 183 quintillion times per second.  According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI,) this activity consumes approximately 131 TeraWatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year – which is more electricity than the country of Ukraine consumes during the same time period.  The main reason for this extreme consumption is because each time bitcoin rises in price, it encourages new miners to join in the battle to win new coins and forces existing outfits to purchase more rigs or upgrade their equipment to remain competitive. When this happens, the amount of computational power used to mine bitcoin increases (hash rate increases) which, in turn, causes the bitcoin protocol to ramp up the difficulty so that blocks continue to be discovered at a steady rate every 10 minutes.  A natural byproduct of this increased competition is higher energy consumption – the more machines whirring away to mine bitcoin, the higher the collective energy consumption.

That effort accelerated Friday with the initial launch of six products spanning the DeFi spectrum: from wallets to staking, from crowdloans to cross-chain bridges, an automated market maker and yield farming to boot.  “Overall, we’re building a ’super app,’ an end-to-end DeFi platform for Polkadot to start,” founder Yubo Ruan told CoinDesk in an interview. He said an Ethereum offering is also in the cards.  The “super app” strategy is an uncommon one in crypto, he said. Most DeFi teams opt to specialize on one flagship product, be it a bridge or a wallet. Ruan said Parallel’s uncommonly large team (60-70 people) means it can cover more ground.  Polkadot DeFi  Parallel is one of the larger DeFi projects in the Polkadot world, with over $500 million in total value locked (TVL) and a 21% market share, according to its website statistics.

Ruan also said the DeFi super app makes the road to mass adoption a little smoother.

However, he added, “What isn’t blatantly obvious is the impact HUT’s acquisition of TeraGo’s Data Center business will have on the company’s future.”  Sutton expects the deal, which closed on Jan. 31, will add about C$20 million (US$15.79 million) of “high-margin, run-rate revenue” for Hut 8, allowing the company to offset the cash burn from its “HODL” strategy of keeping nearly all of its mined crypto. “Our long-term view is the data center business could eventually scale to a level where fiat profits [generated from the data center business] fully cover corporate overhead,” Sutton said.  Hut 8 paid C$30 million in cash in January to buy the TeraGo data center business and brought over about 400 commercial customers across a variety of industry verticals including gaming, visual effects and government agencies. Given Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton’s background of 20 years in the data center business, the miner “now has a familiar asset to monetize with a unique vertical focus,” Sutton wrote.  Read more: Crypto Miner Hut 8 Teams Up With Enthusiast Gaming for Multi-Year Partnership  The data center business is totally uncorrelated to digital asset mining and will help Hut 8 weather some of the market volatility that comes with being a bitcoin miner, while serving “deeply underserved” markets for Web 3 infrastructures, Hut 8 Vice President of Corporate Development Sue Ennis told CoinDesk in an interview.  “We really think it's a tremendous opportunity to complement our [mining] operations,” she said, adding that with the deal the company is taking a long-term view on Web 3 and setting the stage to service the industry as it grows. “The way we look at it is that you don't really need to bet on who the Web 3 winners are going to be when you own the racetrack,” Ennis said.  Shares rose but remain under pressure  Hut 8 shares fell initially on March 17 after the company posted a surprise loss for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results. The decline was short-lived, though, and the stock bounced back for a 7% gain by the end of the session. Still, HUT remains lower by nearly 70% since hitting an all-time high late last year, the shares falling alongside the big drop in the price of bitcoin.  The reported miss on Q4 income was mainly due to a revaluation of some of the warrants the company issued in 2021, which is now classified as liability of $114.2 million. “This is a standard practice for any company that has warrants outstanding,” Ennis said, noting that Hut 8 has the fewest amount of warrants among peers.  While the warrant revaluation made a big impact on GAAP earnings, said Ennis, investors should really be focused on results without the warrant liability - positive earnings of $0.31 per share versus the GAAP reported loss of $0.54.

The game follows the plot of popular games such as Tamagotchi and Pokemon. Gamers collect and breed creatures known as Axies, which they use to battle against other traders and players. Current Axie Infinity price action Axie Infinity price kicked off the second of March at a low of $44. Within a day, the price had skyrocketed all the way to $48.9 on the 15th, before correcting downwards to $47. The bulls had attempted to break past the $50 mark but faced huge resistance from break-even sellers. As of this writing, the price of the AXS token is trading at $47.005. Another attempt by buyers to break past the $48.9 mark was met by a barrier of $48.462. Axie Infinity is only 4 years old and has managed to gain traction within that short duration; as a result of the increasing hype surrounding NFTs and the metaverse.

42394536,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBWsF,1647611871,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty: Everything You Need to Know,"As the name implies, bitcoin mining difficulty refers to the degree of difficulty involved in discovering new bitcoin blocks through mining.  Because the Bitcoin network is completely decentralized and not run by any single overarching authority, an algorithm hard-coded into the source code by Bitcoin’s creator(s) Satoshi Nakamoto is used. This algorithm constantly readjusts the difficulty of the mining process in line with how many miners are operating in the network to ensure that blocks are discovered at a steady pace.  In this guide, we will explore this concept extensively, highlight its importance and detail the method used to determine and adjust bitcoin mining difficulty.  A primer on bitcoin mining  The bitcoin mining process is central to the security and validity of the entire network and its native cryptocurrency – bitcoin (BTC). Mining lies at the core of Bitcoin’s consensus system – that is, the system of agreement used by bitcoin to ensure all distributed participants reach consensus on new data entering the blockchain. The network relies entirely on a decentralized transaction validation process whereby anyone in the world can take up the responsibility of validating new transactions and adding them chronologically into the blockchain via new blocks.  As simple as this sounds, the whole process – known as proof-of-work – involves a computer-intensive effort that requires the would-be validators to use their machines to generate a winning fixed-length code before anyone else does.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  By forcing validators to expend some form of energy to discover new blocks, the idea is it dissuades potential bad actors from participating in the network and attempting to corrupt the blockchain with invalid transactions.  To increase their odds of winning, miners over the years have switched over to using specialized computing equipment called application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners that are capable of generating over one quintillion random codes a second; an exponentially higher number of guesses than any regular laptop is capable of producing per second.  Why bitcoin mining difficulty matters  The Bitcoin difficulty algorithm is programmed to keep the entire system stable by maintaining a 10-minute duration for finding new blocks. In essence, it takes roughly 10 minutes for one miner out of the entire network to generate a winning code and win the right to propose a new block of bitcoin transactions to be added to the blockchain.  To maintain this frequency, the algorithm steps in and increases or decreases the difficulty of mining bitcoin. Whenever there’s an influx of miners or mining rigs, it ramps up the difficulty of mining bitcoin. If the reverse is the case (that is, if there is a drop in the number of miners competing to find new blocks), the protocol reduces the mining difficulty to make it easier for the remaining miners to discover blocs. The mining difficulty of the bitcoin network is altered by adding or reducing the zeros at the front of the target hash.  The target hash is the name given to the specific hash (fixed-length code) that all miners are trying to beat. Whoever generates a random code that happens to have an equal or higher number of zeros at the front than the target hash first is selected as the winner.  Read more: What Does Hashrate Mean?  Without such a system in place, blocks would likely be discovered faster and faster as more miners joined the network with increasingly sophisticated equipment. This would result in new bitcoin entering circulation at an unpredictable rate and would likely have the knock-on effect of inhibiting it’s rise in value.  It’s important to note, a huge part of bitcoin’s appeal is its steady, predictable rate of inflation compared to the unpredictable and rampant inflation of fiat currencies caused by excessive quantitative easing. The fact that the circulating supply is capped at a maximum of 21 million coins also means it’s a truly finite asset with a relatively scarce maximum supply. Both of these factors should, in theory, help support bitcoin’s price over time – assuming demand remains high.  How frequent is bitcoin mining difficulty adjusted?  Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is updated every 2,016 blocks (or roughly every two weeks). This is why each 2,016 block interval is called the difficulty epoch, as the network determines whether the activities of miners for the last two weeks have reduced or increased the time it takes to mine a new block. If the time it takes is below 10 minutes, the mining difficulty will be increased. The opposite occurs when the block time is above 10 minutes.  How is bitcoin mining difficulty calculated?  Bitcoin mining difficulty is calculated with various formulas. However, the most common one is: Difficulty Level = Difficulty Target/Current Target.  Note that the Difficulty Target is a hexadecimal notation of the target hash whose mining difficulty is 1.  In contrast, the current target is the target hash of the most recent block of transactions. When the two values are divided, it yields a whole number which is the difficulty level of mining bitcoin.  For instance, if the answer is 24 trillion, then a miner is expected to generate approximately 24 trillion hashes before he can find the winning hash. Of course, sometimes miners can get lucky and find it with significantly fewer guesses.  How bitcoin mining difficulty is adjusted  Mining difficulty adjustments are made by comparing the standard time it should take to find 2,016 blocks of transactions on the Bitcoin network to the time it took to find the last 2,016 blocks. Keep in mind that the accepted block time is 10 minutes. Therefore, the expected time for mining 2016 blocks is 20,160 minutes (that is, 2016 X 10 minutes).  The network calculates the total time it takes to mine the last 2,016 blocks. The ratio of the standard 20,160 minutes (10 minutes x 2,016 blocks) to the time it took to scale the last difficulty epoch is then multiplied by the most recent difficulty level. The calculation yields a result that will determine the required percentage change in the mining difficulty that will bring the block time to the desired 10 minutes.  That said, an error in the original Bitcoin protocol makes difficulty level adjustments based on the previous 2,015 blocks instead of the theorized 2,016 blocks.  While a 10-minute block time is the goal, the mining difficulty cannot be altered above or below four times the current difficulty level. The upper limit for each difficulty epoch is a +300% change, while the lower is a -75% alteration. This rule is put in place to eliminate any abrupt changes in mining difficulty.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-everything-you-need-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3420c7c266d979e715346bb09eef29b12000c0f0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375078,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5RSb,1647609985,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Downtrend Intact, Recession Fears May Weigh","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin's post-Fed bounce stalls, the shape of the Treasury yield curve may keep risk appetite under check.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Immediate prospects for risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC), look bleak as bond markets question the U.S. central bank's ability to tighten monetary policy without pushing the economy into recession.  ""We're still in a downtrend market. Bear market rallies tend to be extreme. Until we break out of the down trendline, it's hard to say the bull market is around the corner,"" Kevin Kang, founding principal of BKCoin Capital LP, told CoinDesk in an email. He cited potential yield curve inversion, geopolitical tensions as key near-term risks to risk assets, including bitcoin.  Treasury yield curve inversion occurs when the 10-year yield drops under the two-year yield. The U.S. curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.  The curve was just 20 odd basis points short of inverting at press time, having flattened by 70 basis points since early January. So, recession fears will likely linger, keeping risk appetite under check.  ""Look at the massive flattening in the 2y10y – it's signaling that the [Federal Reserve's] ability to engineer a soft landing is quite narrow,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, said, referring to the two-year/10-year Treasury bond spread. ""Plus, there's still a large risk that inflation could remain high and sticky, even with the base effects that could kick in. It's not immediately clear to me that a terminal rate [peak rate of the tightening cycle] of 2.375% would satisfy that.""  On Wednesday, the Fed raised borrowing costs by 25 basis points and signaled six additional rate hikes for the rest of the year. The U.S. central bank tried to calm market nerves by assuring that the economy was strong enough to absorb seven rate hikes. However, that didn't help as the two- and 10-year yield gap broke below 19 basis points right after the Fed statement.  ""The dot plot showed seven hikes this year, which isn't a major surprise, but there's a pretty wide dispersion for next year and the year after, suggesting a lot of uncertainty over the future economic scenario,"" Duong noted.  ""Overall, I haven't seen anything that has changed my view that crypto markets will need to see a stabilization period in the next two or three months before a more sustainable recovery can get underway,"" Duong added.  Bitcoin jumped 4% to $41,700 on Wednesday. However, the follow-through has been anything but bullish so far. ""Market was oversold and saw a lot of short covering across the board,"" BKCoin's Kang said while explaining Wednesday's rise.

42375074,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5ROp,1647609735,Chainlink's Total Value Secured Expansion Isn’t Matched by LINK Token’s Growth,"Chainlink, a provider of real-world data to the smart contracts used in decentralized applications (dapps), has expanded significantly in the last 12 months, with the total value secured (TVS) on its platform leaping to about $58 billion from $7 billion in early 2021, an increase of more than 800%, crypto exchange Coinbase said in a report on Thursday.  The market cap of LINK, the oracle’s utility token, however, is up only about 30% to $6.1 billion during the same period, the report said.  This disparity between Chainlink’s TVS and LINK’s market cap may reflect several issues, said David Duong, Coinbase’s head of institutional research. “Market saturation may limit the platform’s future growth prospects, potential dilution of LINK’s circulating supply is uncertain, and imbalances pertaining to dapp demand, node operator fees and operating costs contribute to selling pressure,” he said.  Coinbase says it is possible that Chainlink 2.0, a planned upgrade of the product's technology, could address some of those issues, adding that the platform could see further adoption from additional use cases and “more cost efficient off-chain computations,” but the timing is still unclear, which makes it difficult to price in some of the potential developments.  In a report published last month, Bank of America said Chainlink could accelerate the adoption of next-generation blockchain use across finance, insurance, supply chain, gaming and gambling.

The investments values the platform at $500 million. C2X says it also has plans to launch its own publicly traded token by the same name, though no date for the release has been set, according to a press release.  The platform, which will include “token economics, NFT marketplaces and a wallet,” will be built on the Terra blockchain and advised by Hashed, a longtime investor in the Web 3 gaming industry and major player in the Terra ecosystem.  C2X says it will also be “guided heavily” and in part developed by South Korean game publisher Com2us, which is also advised by Hashed, according to the press release.  “Right now sentiment has completely shifted since the growth of Axie, the NFT boom and major talent inflow to Web 3,” Baek Kim, managing partner at Hashed, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message, referring to Axie Infinity, a popular blockchain-based online game.  “Com2us is pivoting to be a Web 3-first gaming company,"" Kim said.  Hashed participated in C2X’s private token sale and raised a $200 million fund of its own to support Web 3 gaming and ecosystems in December.  The investment in C2X is the latest affirmation of the confidence that FTX, Jump Crypto and Animoca Brands have in the growing Web 3 gaming industry. The trio’s support for the sector has included hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in the past year through various gaming funds.  “Blockchain technology provides a transparent and secure platform for users to buy, sell and store assets, and applying this concept to video games was the logical next step,” Paul Kim, director of MetaMagnet, said in the press release. “C2X puts the power in the hands of the users and builders, not in a single centralized entity, enabling the full community to direct the platform’s operations and fully invest in its success.”",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/18/web-3-gaming-platform-on-terra-blockchain-gets-25m-boost-from-ftx-jump-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12f85c62498966628444556f79beff6a237b0653-1200x675.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375081,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5RTr,1647604587,Popular Bitcoin Strategy Loses Shine as US Inflation Nears 8%,"The bitcoin cash-and-carry strategy, the crypto market's equivalent of the so called risk-free bet and one of the most sought-after trades, has lost its shine in the wake of rising inflation.  The market-neutral trade, which involves buying an asset in the spot market while selling futures contracts to pocket the spread between the two prices, now offers a negative real yield, or inflation-adjusted return. That's down significantly from a level of more than 10% a year ago.  At press time, three-month futures traded at an annualized premium of roughly 3% on major exchanges, including the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume and open interest, according to data provided by Skew.  That means a trader buying bitcoin (BTC) in the spot market and selling futures contracts would lock in a 3% annualized return in nominal terms. With the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) at 7.9%, that corresponds to a net yield of -4.9% in real terms.  ""Yields are very low at the moment, both in inflation-adjusted terms and nominal terms,"" said Vetle Lunde, a market research analyst at Arcane Research. ""The contracted yields are natural, following the extremely potent and unsustainable yields from last year.""  ""Cash and carry was likely a major source of demand in the spot market, especially last spring, with the market reaching a 50% annualized basis in April,"" Lunde said.  The cash-and-carry arbitrage was quite popular among institutions and sophisticated participants last year and put upward pressure on spot market prices.  With futures trading at a 25% or more premium on the CME and offshore exchanges and CPI at 4% last April, many institutions locked in double-digit inflation-beating returns using the strategy. Even though futures premiums dropped in the second half, with Binance and FTX cutting leverage, carry traders still pocketed at least 5% real return in late October and early November. However, a continued rise in inflation since then has coupled with a bearish market to push real yields into negative territory.  The stablecoin lending market has seen similar developments. ""Stablecoin farms are bleeding and fast as people aren't really paying attention to what matters. Your dollar yields NEED to be adjusted against inflation,"" Split Capital's Zaheer Ebtikar tweeted.  While the real yield from the cash-and carry-arbitrage has turned negative, it's still higher than the inflation-adjusted risk-free rate of return in traditional markets.  According to Investopedia, the yield on the U.S. three-month Treasury bill is widely considered a proxy for risk-free returns. That yield was 0.398% at press time, amounting to a CPI-adjusted risk-free rate of -7.5%. For the 10-year Treasury, the real rate comes to -5.75%, also underperforming the crypto cash-and-carry return.  The crypto market's relative attractiveness will continue to draw traditional market money, according to Split Capital's Ebtikar.  ""Even though stablecoin yield and cash-and-carry are yielding negative in crypto, there are still billions that are yielding even more negative outside of crypto that will continue to come into crypto,"" Ebtikar told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat. ""The USD implied funding rate from futures minus USD inflation is the lowest it's ever been, basically.""  According to quantitative trading firm and liquidity provider Folkvang Trading's Jeff Anderson, there is still interest in the cash-and-carry arbitrage, also known as the basis trade, but the focus has shifted to other crypto subsectors like non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  ""We see new entrants every week who are trying basis arb,"" Anderson said in an email. ""The money for the last six months, though, has not been focused on coins. Retail flows have been directed at NFTs while institutional cash is funneled into VC land.""  Arcane Research's Lunde foresees capital moving into crypto market-making activities or volatility trading.  ""What possibly may attract tradfi [traditional market investors] at the moment, I'd presume, is liquidity provision and market making, or even the low volatility,"" Lunde said in a Twitter chat. ""Decentralized option vaults (DOV) have contributed to lowering the implied volatilities (IV) in the options market, and contrarian volatility bets might become a more common strategy, offsetting the DOV pressure on the IV.""  DeFi option vaults became popular in the last quarter of 2021 and have contributed to the steady decline in bitcoin and ether implied volatilities, as noted in the First Mover newsletter dated Jan. 10. That has reduced yields on options selling. Implied volatility has a positive impact on the option's price.  However, according to Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer of crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime, there are still pockets of good yield in some decentralized finance pools and options.  ""The simple decentralized finance pools are low single digits, but some more complex pools like on [AVAX-based stableswap platform] Platypus or [scaling solution] Cosmos are still ~ 20%,"" Tang said in a Telegram chat. Cash-and-carry arbitrage and trading out-of-the-money higher strike call options were LedgerPrime's preferred strategies in the first half of 2021.",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/18/popular-bitcoin-strategy-loses-shine-as-us-inflation-nears-8,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a506fcafb76e2a4408e2ce61ba461dbe030f00b8-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375082,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5RV7,1647593086,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Drops for Second Time in March,"The difficulty of mining a bitcoin (BTC) block dropped 0.35% on Thursday, the second time this month, after a consistent climb since November.  On March 3, mining difficulty dropped 1.5%, data from information platform Glassnode shows.  The difficulty adjusts automatically relative to the computing power on the network, also known as the hashrate, to keep the time between each mined block relatively stable at 10 minutes.  The bitcoin mining hashrate has dropped from an all-time high in February of 248 exahash/second (EH/s) to 216 EH/s on March 17, according to Glassnode data.  ""This slight drop is likely due to unprofitable miners unplugging ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). As energy prices increase globally, we will likely see more ASICs fall off the network,"" Compass Mining founder and CEO Whitt Gibbs told CoinDesk in a Telegram message on Friday.  Electricity prices are soaring across the world as one of the world's largest exporters of fossil fuels, Russia, is enthralled in a war with Ukraine, and global energy supply chains are being severed by sanctions.  ""My bet is that Kazakh miners going offline due to electricity shortages and a government crackdown on illegal mining caused the drop,"" Jaran Mellerud, researcher at Oslo-based Arcane Research, told CoinDesk.  On March 15, Kazakh authorities said they seized almost $200 million of equipment from crypto mining operations as they crack down on illicit mines. Legally operating miners in Kazakhstan had their power cut off at the end of January, as the government struggled with energy shortages.  ""Using HashrateIndex's prices per TH (terahash, a measurement of the hashrate, the computing power on the bitcoin mining network) for rigs with medium efficiency, the Kazakh government should have seized around 3 TH/s worth of mining rigs, equivalent to 1.5% of bitcoin's hashrate,"" Mellerud said.  Despite the fact that North American miners continue to plug in new machines, ""the withdrawal of capacity from Kazakhstan is currently limiting bitcoin's hashrate growth,"" he said.

The Ultiverse ecosystem allows players to import their own NFTs from multiple supported blockchains for use in the virtual world, and also support NFT and land customization. Ultiverse will launch in tandem with its first internal game, a 3D multiplayer role-playing game in which different roles of players be able to interact with each other.  “The first generation of GameFi has been predominantly simple card-based games, and AAA games with high quality are in great need,” shared Gwendolyn Regina, investment director at BNB Chain Fund, which participated in the round.  “Ultiverse has one of the best teams with a stellar track record building top tier games.

The ACCC alleges the ads, which promoted investment in cryptocurrency or money-making schemes, were likely to mislead Facebook users into believing the advertised schemes were associated with well-known people featured in the ads, such as businessman Dick Smith, TV presenter David Koch and former NSW Premier Mike Baird. The schemes were in fact scams, and the people featured in the ads had never approved or endorsed them.  The ads contained links that took Facebook users to a fake media article that included quotes attributed to the public figure featured in the ad endorsing a cryptocurrency or money-making scheme. Users were then invited to sign up and were subsequently contacted by scammers who used high pressure tactics, such as repeated phone calls, to convince users to deposit funds into the fake schemes.  “The essence of our case is that Meta is responsible for these ads that it publishes on its platform,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. “It is a key part of Meta’s business to enable advertisers to target users who are most likely to click on the link in an ad to visit the ad’s landing page, using Facebook algorithms. Those visits to landing pages from ads generate substantial revenue for Facebook.”  The ACCC complaint accuses Meta, the compamy formerly known as Facebook, of failing to prevent ""publication of fake ads even after the celebrities reported similar false, misleading or deceptive ads to Meta.""

The agreement would restructure a $45 billion loan the country received in 2018.  The cryptocurrency provision is part of a Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) signed by Argentina and the IMF on March 3.  The agreement was already approved by the Chamber of Deputies, lower house of the Argentine National Congress, on March 11 and was scheduled to be discussed late Thursday by the Senate for final approval.
