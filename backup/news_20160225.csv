42398897,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhHyt,1456438819,ASIC Chief: Blockchain Will Have 'Profound Implications' for Regulators,"The head of Australia’s top securities watchdog said earlier this month that blockchain technology will have ""profound implications"" for how government officials regulate the marketplace.  Greg Medcraft, who has led the Australia Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) since 2011, was speaking before the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum Roundtable, a discussion forum for public and private finance institutions, at a meeting in London on 15th February.  In his speech, Medcraft discussed the impending ""digital disruption"" in capital markets, with a particular emphasis on blockchain technology. He argued that regulators need to move to better understand these changes and how to respond to them.  ""Given the speed of change – we need to think about that tool kit now,"" he said.  He spoke about how the potential adoption of the technology in capital markets could boost market efficiency, cut transaction costs, improve transparency and improve access to those markets for both investors and companies looking to raise money.  Medcraft went on to say that blockchain tech has the possibility to reshape how regulators like ASIC operate, but expressed caution against over-regulation – echoing a refrain from a growing number of regulators worldwide, as well as comments he himself has issued in the past.  Medcraft remarked:  ""Blockchain will have profound implications for how we regulate. We will need to find the right balance between speed of execution and streamlining of business processes. As regulators and policy makers, we need to ensure what we do is about harnessing the opportunities and the broader economic benefits – not standing in the way of innovation and development.""  The ASIC chief also offered details on some of the actions the Australian securities regulator has taken in response, including surveillance of firms and products released in the market and the development of methods for bringing forward enforcement actions in cases that involve blockchain data.  ""We are working to understand how enforcement action can be taken where a transaction entered into here or overseas is recorded in the blockchain,"" he said.  Ultimately, Medcroft noted, regulators need strike the right kind of balance, concluding:  ""We want to help industry to take advantage of the opportunities on offer, whether it is from blockchain technology, or other innovations – but not at any price.""

42398908,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhIAh,1456430374,Payments Players Move on Blockchain Tech in Industry Shake-Up,"Amid a steady stream of positive news, incumbent payment companies are quickly launching products and services incorporating blockchain technology.  To date, payments firms openly offering blockchain services include financial technology provider D+H, online payments startup Dwolla and cross-border payments specialist Earthport, though the latest to launch an offering is PayCommerce, a decade-old software-as-a-service payments and remittance platform that connects network members across the globe.  Each has so far taken a different approach to leveraging its market presence and products in a bid to win business, though all seem intent on taking advantage of their existing expertise and client networks in ways that would be difficult for blockchain startups.  Earthport, for example, now incorporates the Ripple protocol as part of its Distributed Ledger Payments Hub. Likewise, D+H has added blockchain tech to its Global PAYPlus payments hub. Dwolla, in turn, sees itself working on the outside of the DLT industry altogether, connecting digital asset movement on a blockchain to real-world cash payments.  In addition to how they’re using the technology, payments companies seem split on the types of blockchain software they're building services on. PayCommerce and D+H, for example, are unique in that they have built their own blockchains instead of relying on the bitcoin protocol or working with industry startups.  While that could seem risky, PayCommerce chief technology officer Sha Kader told CoinDesk the company has an advantage over startups still looking for enterprise customers.  Blockchain is, after all, a network technology, and one of the biggest hurdles for blockchain startups remains signing on users and interoperating between those users, something PayCommerce, with its 80 correspondent bank members and large corporate clients.  Both PayCommerce and Earthport are working to employ the technology within the boundaries of their business models. PayCommerce, for instance, doesn’t handle customer money and so doesn’t deal with MSB regulatory burdens. In contrast, Earthport acts as a business and compliance layer built on top, a move that makes sense for Earthport as a money services business.  Moving beyond hype  In recent months, both established companies and startups have rebranded traditional databases as ""bitcoin-inspired"" ledgers in an effort to take advantage of the blockchain ballyhoo and the technology's strong association with innovation.  But, not everyone believes the trend is positive.  Dave Birch, a payments expert with Consult Hyperion, recently lamented about the misuse of the term ""blockchain"", a word that’s become detached from its technological definition of a shared ledger implementation.  Even payments companies seeking to leverage the technology agree with this assessment of the industry.  Karen Morgan, head of marketing at PayCommerce, told CoinDesk:  ""It’s great overall that [DLT] is bubbling up to the top in terms of awareness because there’s benefit and value in the tech. But because everyone is really overusing the word it’s creating a lot of noise which makes it hard to differentiate.”  PayCommerce contends that its solution isn't just hype.  According to Kader, PayCommerce is developing a permissioned blockchain in a closed-loop model where each bank in the network gets a copy of the ledger that tracks transactions. PayCommerce itself controls access to the ledger and verifies transactions. An extensive rules-based engine allows smart contracts to move IOU tokens on the ledger.  Blockchain could be particularly helpful for transacting cross border since, in the traditional system, settlement delays can happen for a number of reasons, including a country’s inability to handle real-time settlement or more cumbersome regulatory compliance.  ""In an instance where the settlement is delayed, through smart contracts we have rules that generate an IOU token,"" Kader said. That IOU token is an asset on the network, similar to bitcoin the currency riding on the blockchain, he said.  While member banks can see the transactions happening on the blockchain, Kader continued, PayCommerce has the capability to limit access so only the banks that need to see certain transactions can.  PayCommerce plans on wrapping up its beta test in June with a DLT for cross-border payments launch shortly after that.  Implications unclear  While payments companies are interested in the technology, it’s less clear what the ultimate impact their investment in the space will be.  Are payments companies providing a mature layer of business support to a fledgling technology? Or are they trying to capitalize on its potential in a bid to hedge against any future impact to their business models? It seems the verdict is still out.  James Wester, research director in the global payments practice at IDC Financial Insights, believes that the attention is a positive indicator for the technology and a sign of its maturity.  Distributed ledger technologies ""have elicited so much excitement and attention, but along with that are serious use cases where the technology makes sense,"" he said, adding:  ""Just because it’s a bandwagon, doesn’t mean it’s not important or...it’s not serious.""  Wester contends that because DLT is so new, no one company or entrepreneur really has a first-mover advantage, and with the technology being open source, it would be hard to keep any kind of core advantage.  Although he acknowledges that many legacy institutions don’t have blockchain experts internally, so the industry could start seeing a significant number of acquisitions for talent in an attempt to compete with the offerings of startups.  Ni’coel Stark, managing principal at a stealth venture capital firm, agrees.  ""To build something quickly and proficiently is something that many businesses cannot do on their own, and that’s why corporations decide to move on a tech and talent acquisition,"" she told CoinDesk. ""This would be particularly true with blockchain, as the number of experts in the space are few, especially when measured against blockchain’s potential for disruption.""  Still, it's possible that the work of legacy players in DLT could end up making it harder for startups to find investors.  A substantial amount of money has so far been invested into bitcoin and blockchain startups over the past couple years, but as large enterprises build in-house or launch innovation labs, some of that investment might dry up.  After all, large corporates aren’t looking for investment rounds, they're now effectively seeding startups in their own innovation labs.

42398904,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhI6l,1456424566,European Parliament Report Proposes Task Force on Digital Currencies,"A new European Parliament draft report on digital currencies calls for the creation of a task force specifically devoted to the technology.  The report, penned by European Parliament member (MEP) Jakob von Weizsäcker of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, seeks the establishment of a task force, with its own budget and dedicated staff, that would study digital currencies and provide policy advice to the European Union and member-states.  Further, the report calls for tightening regulation of both exchanges and wallet service providers – something the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, is already considering. At the same time, the European Council is also weighing digital currency regulation.  The publication of the report follows a hearing in late January during which MEPs discussed bitcoin and blockchain technology within the context of terrorist financing and money laundering.  Despite the calls for stronger rules in regards to digital currency activity, the report notes that the technology has ""the potential to contribute positively to consumer welfare and economic development"". It goes on to echo comments made by von Weizsäcker during the January hearing about avoiding burdensome regulation.  ""[The European Parliament] calls for a proportionate regulatory approach so as not to stifle innovation at an early stage, while taking seriously the regulatory challenges that the widespread use of [virtual currencies] and [distributed ledger technology] might pose,"" it states.  At the same time, the report seeks approval for what it calls ""rapid and forceful regulatory measures"", stating:  ""But such a smart regulatory regime based on analytical excellence and proportionality must not be confused with light touch regulation: rapid and forceful regulatory measures need to be part of the toolkit in order to address risks before they become systemic if and when appropriate.""  The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is expected to vote on the report’s contents in April, and if approved, could move to the full Parliament for a vote as early as May.

42398899,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhI1q,1456418355,Exchange Acquisition Consolidates Finland's Bitcoin Market,"Finnish bitcoin broker Prasos has acquired Helsinki-based digital currency exchange Coinmotion for an undisclosed sum.  The acquisition of the exchange by Prasos – which operates a different bitcoin exchange called Bittiraha.fi, as well as a bitcoin ATM network in Finland – follows a trend of exchange consolidation in the past year.  While Prasos, which has headquarters in Jyväskylä, Finland, declined to disclose the buy price, it say the cash deal involved the purchase of the Coinmotion platform along with its customer base.  While none of the exchange staff will stay with the firm through the transition, Prasos indicated that some elements of the outgoing team may in future work on the platform on a contract basis.  Coinmotion  went live under the new management on 23rd February.  International plans  Prasos co-founder and CEO Henry Brade told CoinDesk the deal gives Prasos the ability to compete in the broader European exchange market, as well as in other regions, saying:  “We believe we can take on players like Coinbase etc, in more places than just Finland. We differentiate ourselves in one major way from all other major exchanges – we try to ask our customers as few questions as possible.""  In the interview, Brade said his company began discussing an acquisition with the Coinmotion team in the spring of 2015.  Brade framed the acquisition as a means for Prasos to expand its services, with the exchange proving the ability to offer features it previously could not.  “Our service at Bittiraha is a simple form-based system with no accounts and no wallets, and some users definitely prefer that,"" he explained. ""But investor type users want accounts, wallets, ability to store EUR and BTC with us and high security (vault service), and we can offer all of that with Coinmotion.”  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/25/exchange-acquisition-consolidates-finlands-bitcoin-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38eebfdff51cd3e5774f2d5a3f8f70f2c186f8de-2560x1849.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42398900,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhI3o,1456398002,Royal Bank of Canada Reveals Blockchain Trial With Ripple,"Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) has revealed it is working on a new proof of concept (PoC) for distributed ledger-based remittances using technology offered by industry startup Ripple.  The announcement comes via a new Deloitte Tech Trends publication in which the professional services firm discussed how RBC sought to better understand distributed ledger technology and how it could be applied to remittances.  RBC and Ripple, Deloitte said, are now working on a ""limited production"" PoC with the goal of evaluating how the distributed ledger trial could impact other areas of the bank's business if more widely implemented.  The report reads:  ""As much promise as blockchain represents, it is crucial to validate its scalability, reliability, security and performance for a large-scale deployment. RBC looks to do just that before expanding into other areas.""  In statements, Eddy Ortiz, RBC’s vice president of solution acceleration and innovation, also discussed the difficulty of moving the PoC past the ideation stage due to issues in articulating their internal pitch for how the technology could solve business problems.  ""We either oversimplified our plan and senior leadership didn’t see the value, or we went too technical and lost them,"" Ortiz stated.  Ortiz was ultimately successful, however, and in addition to remittances is working to develop a blockchain-based loyalty platform.  Notably, the release comes amid a broader push by Ripple to promote awareness about its partnerships with financial incumbents, following on the heels of a report that aimed to promote the cost savings enterprise users could achieve with its technology.  The publication found Deloitte speaking out about the benefits of Ripple’s consensus ledger, including what it called its ability to ""mitigate fraud, credit, [foreign exchange] and counterparty risks"".

42398895,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhHwv,1456374118,Blythe Masters: Wall Street Has Advantage Over Blockchain Startups,"Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, discussed the potential business impact of blockchain technology at an event sponsored by Women in Fintech and the Financial Women’s Association in New York this week.  Hosted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the event saw Masters speaking out about what she portrayed as the risk financial incumbents face by not taking steps to investigate potential applications of blockchain technology in their operations.  Addressing the audience, she cautioned that by taking a 'wait-and-see' approach to the technology, certain financial providers run the risk of being left behind.  Masters told the audience:  ""There's the fact that there are entire business models that have the risk of being disintermediated if a competitor of yours manages to take full advantage of this technology before you’ve fully appreciated or deployed it.""  Despite this, she stated she believes that startups are unlikely to disrupt many of the larger firms due to their sheer size and market reach, adding that she sees the technology consolidating existing players in the industry.  ""The advantage of being an incumbent rather than a newcomer is that the economies of scale are gigantic,"" she said.  Masters also discussed her departure from JPMorgan to blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, with the aim of dismissing inaccurate stories about her move.  Masters joined Digital Asset, first as a board member in 2014, becoming CEO in March 2015. The company has since raised more than $60m to address industry challenges including regulatory reform and capital requirements, operational risk, systemic risk and cyber risk.  But becoming the CEO of a company that was in any way linked to bitcoin was not something she – or anyone – could have foreseen, Masters said.  ""The one thing I said to myself was that I was not going to agree to take any board work, because the eventual day job could be in conflict to the board,"" she said, adding:  ""I made an exception [at Digital Asset Holding] because there was absolutely no way that there would ever be a conflict, because there was no way that I would work in the technology sector and especially one associated with bitcoin.""  Abstracting out bitcoin  Before Masters spoke, Amal Aly, a director in the financial services advisory at PwC, introduced the concept of blockchain technology to the room. She explained the present-day ecosystem whereby financial information is fragmented and siloed.  ""Lots of time is expended reconciling mismatched information,"" she said. ""Different parties of the same transaction keep separate records because we don’t trust the [other involved party].""  However, with blockchain technology, that is not necessary. ""By creating a shared distributed ledger, blockchain automates trust,"" she said, stressing: ""[Blockchain] is the technology beneath the bitcoin cryptography, but it is not bitcoin.""  For Masters, it took reading beyond what was written in the press for her to better understand the opportunities presented by bitcoin's underlying technology.  ""I had not read particularly complimenting things in the press, with it being linked to undesired activities,"" she said. ""Yet, the interesting thing is, if you abstract from all of that and think about the problem bitcoin was intended to solve, it turns out it is a very interesting problem that has implications for financial infrastructure.""  Fundamentally, what the technology allowed for was a trustless environment, she said.  Masters argued that the problem bitcoin was intended to solve was to “create a network where parties who didn’t know each other” could exchange value between and amongst themselves.  Once bitcoin was abstracted out of the equation, she explained, what was left was a system whereby parties could exchange value and be completed confident that the item was not counterfeited and hadn’t been faked.  ""The blockchain was lost in the noise because [bitcoin] was being proposed by people who wanted to see the end of financial institutions and who didn’t want government intervention,"" Masters said.  Male-dominated world  The night concluded with Masters drawing attention to how finance is a male-dominated field, and telling her personal story of how she rose through the ranks of JPMorgan and became the leader of a now well-financed blockchain company.  ""There are positives and negatives to being a woman in the context of an industry that is male dominated,"" she said. ""In the long run, at least for me, the challenge has been the balance of those positives and negatives and to recognize they're a part of the environment and learn to live with and take advantage of that.""  She went on to state that, when taking actions male colleagues might have been able to get away with, she was told to not ""be so bloody aggressive"".  Still, being both a mother and a career woman was something that did present the CEO with challenges.  ""The reality is, it was a choice I made to have a child and have a career. I think, with hindsight, that I became a better operator in my job for having been a parent than I otherwise would have been. I became a better parent than I otherwise would have been if I didn’t have a career,"" she said.  Masters concluded the event by focusing on her own personal ethic:  ""As a woman, you are perceived as something different. A lot of people don’t think the game is worth playing under those slightly asymmetric circumstances.""  Blythe Masters will be speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus 2016, 2nd-4th May, in New York.
