26694793,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606039,1714604437,Altcoins In Trouble As Seasoned Analyst Predicts 40% Drop In Prices,"Altcoins have suffered more in the crypto market following the Bitcoin price crash, leaving a lot of investors in losses. This is not out of the ordinary as these altcoins are known to have a higher volatility compared to Bitcoin, hence, their price swings can be more pronounced. Given the recent decline, the expectation is that the altcoins will recover. However, one analyst does not agree with that assessment. Altcoins Headed For 40% Crash In an analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), seasoned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen shocked the crypto community with his expectations for altcoins. According to the analysis, the worst is far from over for the altcoin market, as there are still more crashes to come. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals Why $59,800 Is An Important Level For Bitcoin Cowen explained that this was analyzed using altcoins versus Bitcoin pairs, and it seems each one looks weak against the apex cryptocurrency. This is due to the expected rate cuts, and historical performance suggests that a decline will follow. The crypto analyst pointed to the 2019 rate cuts and how altcoins had reacted to that development back then. Following the rate cuts, altcoins plunged against Bitcoin, with major players recording up to 40% losses during this time. “Perhaps this time is not different? This would mean ALT/BTC pairs drop another 40% from here over the next few months,” Cowen said. Cowen expects this to place out regardless of what happens in the market in the meantime. He explains that even if the market does recover in the short term, it does not invalidate the thesis. “Short-term countertrends do not invalidate this view,” he stated. If this repeats, then it could turn an already harsh market trend even bloodier. The altcoin market cap has already fallen below $1 trillion as of the time of writing, but a 40% decline from here could send it as low as $600 billion. Bitcoin Crash Drags Down Crypto Market While the Bitcoin crash has been brutal, the impact on altcoins has been much more pronounced. Ethereum has held up nicely with less than a 4% decline during this time, but others such as Stacks (STX), Arweave (AR), Neo (NEO), and Sei (SEI) are down an average of 9% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Expert Says ETH Is Yet To Bottom Against Bitcoin Meme coins were also not left out of the bloodbath, with market leader Dogecoin dropping 6% to $0.126 and Pepe (PEPE) plunging 7.74% to $0.0000063. Bonk (BONK) recorded a 5% decline to eliminate some of its gains from last week, and Shiba Inu fell 4.18%. Amid all of this, though, there have been some market winners, with Optimism (OP) recording 12% gains. Cosmos (ATOM) followed with a 9.8% increase, and Starknet (STRK) rose 9%, making them the top gainers of the day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

26692368,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606049,1714600804,Is This Cycle’s Bitcoin Bottom In? Analysts Forecast BTC Bounce Back,"As May 1st started, Bitcoin (BTC) faced a new correction that made the price stumble under the $60,000 support level. The flagship cryptocurrency has seen several retraces during this bull cycle, with BTC swiftly recovering the crucial support zones each time. However, in the past 24 hours, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to regain its momentum. Some analysts believe Bitcoin’s bottom this cycle might be in as this correction officially became its deepest retrace. Related Reading: If History Repeats, This Is How Bitcoin Price Will Perform In The Next 6 Months Is The Bitcoin Bottom Here? In the early hours of Tuesday, Bitcoin started to plunge from the $64,000 price range. As the day continued, BTC prolonged its fall to briefly trading around $59,958 – $59,191 before recovering. This time, the recovery didn’t last long as Bitcoin’s price resumed its downward trajectory to $57,000. In an X thread, crypto trader Milkybull examined some data suggesting the bottom might finally be in. According to the analyst, BTC is “following the 2017 PA.” This would suggest that “either the bottom is in or close.” Moreover, he urged investors to remember that while good news “usually signals the top,” bad news signals a bull market’s bottom. In the thread, the trader pointed out that the Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band indicator historically serves strong support during BTC’s bull cycles. As a result, he considers that the flagship cryptocurrency might “wick through the support and bounce back.” 2024's Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band indicator resembling 2017's. Source: MilkybullCrypto on X According to the analyst, Bitcoin and global liquidity are also strongly correlated, with BTC currently at a level it has previously bounced back from. These bouncebacks initiated “huge rallies across the crypto market” in October 2022 and October 2023. Lastly, the thread highlighted that Bitcoin “is at a critical decision point for the local bottom.” The trader considers that while some call for a $48,000 bottom, the $51,000 support level might be where BTC bounces back to resume its cycle to this cycle’s top. Bitcoin’s Deepest Retrace This Cycle According to crypto analyst and trader Rekt Capital, this correction has officially been the deepest BTC retrace this cycle. Per the post, today’s -23.64% retrace surpasses the -22.91% retrace seen in February 2023. The analyst also compared this cycle’s “Post-Halving” pullback to 2016’s. Moreover, the trader considers that this bullish cycle might be more similar to the 2016 one than investors think. #BTC We are here (orange circle) And we've seen Post-Halving pullbacks like this in the past (e.g. 2016)$BTC #Bitcoin #BitcoinHalving pic.twitter.com/OvOcmJTzFk — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 1, 2024 Previously, Rekt Capital listed three reasons these two cycles might be similar. Per the trader, the resemblances include the “Pre-Halving Re-Accumulation Range Breakout,” the “Pre-Halving Retrace Beginning,” and the “Similar Initial Reaction after the beginning of the Pre-Halving Retrace.” After today’s retrace, the analyst added the “Continued downside in the three weeks after the Halving” as a fourth similarity between the 2016 and 2024 cycles. Like eight years ago, Bitcoin faces an “additional downside below the Range Low of its Re-Accumulation Range” in the three-week window after Bitcoin’s “Halving.” Moreover, the analyst suggests that the current price development comes “as no surprise,” as it mirrors 2016’s “post-Halving Danger Zone.” As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading at $57,794.89. This correction represents a 6.2% drop in the past 24 hours. Similarly, BTC is registering 13.4% and 17.7% price decreases in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

Despite this recent market downtrend, Bitcoin investors remain confident as they believe the flagship crypto can still reach new heights in this market cycle. Some say this might be what Bitcoin needs before making another parabolic run to the upside. Bitcoin’s Decline Is Nothing To Be Scared Of Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision, reassured in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin’s recent price decline was not unusual, stating it was “pretty ordinary stuff.” He also pointed out that this was Bitcoin’s fourth 20% correction in the past 12 months, underscoring how normal these price movements are. Related Reading: Crypto Funds Mark 3rd Consecutive Weeks Of Outflows With $435 Million In Withdrawals Source: X Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, had previously warned that price declines of such magnitude were to be expected, stating that “bull markets are not straight lines up.” He noted that the same thing happened in the 2021 and 2017 bull runs when Bitcoin experienced about 13 price drawdowns of over 10% or more. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital claimed in an X post that “this is exactly what the cycle needs to resynchronize with historical price norms and the traditional Halving Cycle.” He added, “The longer this goes on, the better.” In another X post, he reassured his followers that Bitcoin is getting closer to its final bottom with each passing day. Like Rekt Capital, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also sounded confident that Bitcoin’s recent decline was just a part of the bigger picture for its move to the upside. They claimed this would be the “final shakeout before up, only rally to a cycle top.” Thomas Fahrer, the CEO of Apollo, also shared his bullish sentiment towards Bitcoin, as he suggested that the crypto token’s volatility is what makes it a great investment. “Price might fall to $40K, but it might rise to $400K. That’s just how it is, and it’s a great bet. Bitcoin is still the best asymmetric opportunity in the market,” he wrote on X. Bitcoin Bull Run Is Far From Over Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that Bitcoin’s bull run was far from over while comparing Bitcoin’s current price action to the last two halving events. According to him, Bitcoin consolidated for 189 and 87 days around the halving in 2016 and 2020, respectively, before the bull run resumed. Source: X He further noted that Bitcoin has only consolidated for 60 days this time around, meaning that the flagship crypto will continue its run eventually. In a subsequent X post, the analyst stated that Bitcoin might be 538 days away from hitting its next market top if it follows its trend from the previous two bull runs. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Bullish Signals, Can It Rally 50% From Here? Before now, Martinez mentioned that Bitcoin could rise to a new all-time high (ATH) of $92,190 if it breaches the resistance level of $69,150.

Drawing from the weekly chart, the trader maintains a bullish outlook, saying the coin will shake off weakness in the coming session. This aligns with bulls for the better part of Q4 2023 and Q1 2024. Bitcoin Is Falling, Losses $60,000 Bitcoin is under intense liquidation pressure, struggling against the deluge of sellers. Earlier today, BTC broke below $60,000, melting below April 2024 lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dips Below $57,000: 4 Key Reasons This dump confirmed sellers of April 13, signaling a possible start of a bear formation that may see BTC lose ground, peeling back February and March 2024 gains. Nonetheless, the analyst maintains that the uptrend will remain as long as Bitcoin stays above the $49,000 to $52,000 support zone, soaking up all selling pressure. This assessment, based on candlestick arrangement, can serve as a reassurance to BTC holders. The trader maintains that despite the sell-off, panic is unwarranted at this point. Referring to the Elliott Wave Principle, a technical analysis indicator, the analyst points out that the coin is simply pausing. For those with a more aggressive trading strategy, the dip, ideally towards the above support zone, could present an opportunity to buy on dips in anticipation of Wave 5. Currently, the analyst notes Bitcoin is in Wave 4, a stage that will take approximately the same time as Wave 2. Then, prices dumped after a brief rally, peaking in May 2023. However, prices rally in Wave 3, pushing prices below $30,000 to fresh all-time highs, peaking at $73,800. The drop from all-time highs to spot rates, looking at the Elliot Wave Theory, could indicate that prices are in Wave 4 before the eventual leg up, ending at Wave 5. What’s Next? Will BTC Breach $100,000 In Wave 5? Even so, when BTC will bottom up remains to be known. As things stand, the analyst said traders should watch two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of the 21 and 50 periods. A retest of these dynamic levels could offer support, preparing traders to buy on dips in anticipation of the final Wave 5. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price For May 2024 However, the analyst didn’t lay out the next possible target even from the chart. Still, if Wave 3 is around the same length as Wave 5, Bitcoin has a strong chance to surpass $100,000 after the current volatile price action ends.

Also pretty much as expected, the FOMC acknowledged that progress on lower inflation has stalled this year and said it wouldn't be appropriate to trim rates until it has greater confidence inflation is moving ""sustainably"" towards 2%.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} has bounced modestly in the minutes since the news hit, but remains under pressure, down more than 4% for the session at $58,000.  In addition to the rate news, the FOMC announced it is slowing the reduction of Treasuries held on its balance sheet – the so-called quantitative tightening (QT) – from $60 billion per month to just $25 billion per month. Other things being equal, the move is likely to boost risk appetite and asset prices, wrote economist Joseph Brusuelas.     Markets came into 2024 expecting a long series of rate cuts from the U.S. central bank, but those hopes have been whittled down sharply over the past few weeks as the economy continues to show strength and inflation has actually risen a bit in the year's first four months. According the CME FedWatch tool, markets (prior to today's Fed decision) were pricing in a nearly 25% chance of zero rate cuts this year. One month ago, there was just a 1% chance of no Fed easing in 2024.  That change in expectations has weighed a bit on traditional markets, with the Nasdaq lower by about 5% since hitting its 2024 high about three weeks ago and the S&P 500 off by a similar amount since touching its year-to-date high in late March. It's also likely contributed to the plunging bitcoin price, which is now down more than 20% from its record high from mid-March above $73,000.  A check of traditional markets shortly after the FOMC announcement, finds stocks remaining little-changed and the dollar and bond yields slightly lower. Gold is up 0.5% at $2,316 per ounce but remains about 4% down from its record high above $2,400 hit in mid-April.

42390931,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPzmP,1714586400,The Protocol: EigenLayer's 'Intersubjective Forking' Is Objectively Not Done,"EigenLayer, the Ethereum ""restaking"" project that quickly shot to the top ranks of the DeFi leaderboards thanks to so-called airdrop farmers, finally acknowledged plans to launch its own EIGEN token. The terms of the planned airdrop – or ""stakedrop"" as Eigen Foundation described it – left many traders disappointed, especially those who failed to manage their expectations. And there were also lots of questions about how the EIGEN tokenomics will work – and when. In this week's episode, we attempt to simplify it all; readers should manage their expectations.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  ALSO:  Arbitrum developer does the right thing – for its biggest rival.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: SEDA, Ocean, Stacks, Minima, Ether.Fi, SSV.  Nearly $80 million of blockchain project fundraisings.  April's winners and losers in the blue-chip CoinDesk 20 index.  Network news  INTERSUBJECTIFYING THE FORKIFICATION: The Ethereum restaking project EigenLayer, whose plan to repurpose the Ethereum blockchain's security to hordes of additional protocols has prompted systemic risk warnings from Vitalik Buterin himself, released a 43-page whitepaper on its forthcoming EIGEN token – more than twice as long as the original 19-page whitepaper on EigenLayer. To address the concerns, the project, led by the sesquipedalian computer engineer Sreeram Kannan, came up with a new plan for something called ""intersubjective forking."" The purpose of this mechanism would be to take care of ""instances of misbehavior that cannot be objectively identified on-chain, yet any two reasonable observers would agree that a penalty is deserved."" If such an ""intersubjective fault"" were to occur, the EIGEN token could be forked without having to fork the main Ethereum blockchain. Are you with me so far? Well, there's a catch, according to a blog post: Very little of this will be functional when the EIGEN token launches: ""With its design being completely novel, the concept needs to be absorbed and discussed widely by the ecosystem participants. The initial implementation of intersubjective staking at this launch mirrors the full protocol to only a limited extent. However, there are still several parameters that need to be determined for full actuation."" Such a not-really-fully-functional system would echo EigenLayer's mainnet launch a few weeks ago, where, as detailed by Coindesk, crucial promised features, including the paramount ""slashing"" and ""attributable security"" mechanisms, were held back from the launch, because they weren't ready. It goes without saying that a lot of these details were lost on crypto traders who had poured some $15 billion of deposits into the project, many of them merely hoping to qualify for the EIGEN token airdrop that roughly zero people in crypto doubted would eventually come. The parsimoniousness of the terms, however, apparently left many of these so-called airdrop farmers wanting. ""Not all feedback was glowing,"" as the Bankless newsletter put it, and complaints centered partly on the token's initial period of ""non-transferability."" Only 15% of the tokens will go to the ""stakedrop"" – the Eigen Foundation's term – and more than half of the tokens will be allocated to investors and early contributors, with unlocks starting after just one year.  In this schematic from the EIGEN token whitepaper, ""intersubjectively attributable faults"" lies somewhere between ""objectively attributable faults"" and ""subjective faults.""  MIXING IT UP: Ratcheting up a campaign against creators of blockchain protocols allegedly used to facilitate money laundering, U.S. prosecutors charged Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez, 35, and William Lonergan Hill, 65, with conspiracy to commit money laundering. Rodriguez has pleaded not guilty. Samourai Wallet was (its servers have been seized) a bitcoin wallet that promised to ""keep your transactions private and your identity masked” through a privacy-preserving service called ""Whirlpool,"" as reported by CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has ramped up efforts to knock down these coin ""mixing"" services. That includes arresting Bitcoin Fog operator Roman Sterlingov in April 2021 and participating in the arrest of the co-founders of Tornado Cash in 2023. The cases are prompting a fresh examination of the legal issues around open-source software. Is code speech? Late last week, companies behind the popular Lightning wallet Phoenix and privacy-preserving Wasabi Wallet took steps to close off access to U.S. customers – raising the additional question of whether blockchain innovation is more likely to occur outside the U.S. due to regulatory pressure or uncertainty.  Schematic illustrating basic concepts of how Samourai Whirlpool works. (Samourai)  ALSO:  The developer OP Labs, behind the Ethereum layer-2 network Optimism, disclosed in an April 26 blog post that two security issues had been found in its highly anticipated fraud proof system, currently on testnet. The irony was that the vulnerabilities were discovered by the project's biggest rival, Offchain Labs, behind the layer-2 network Arbitrum. Offchain not only proceeded to publish a lengthy blog post about the matter, but Offchain CEO Steven Goldfeder found time to crow that ""our team has a ton of expertise in building fraud proof systems, and I'm proud of our team for helping make Ethereum safer for everyone."" He tacked on a few heart emojis.  Six years after dropping support for bitcoin (BTC), Stripe is bringing back its crypto payments service, though initially only for Circle’s USDC stablecoin – on the Solana, Ethereum and Polygon blockchains.  BlackRock, a bitcoin ETF provider, received more than $20,000 in Runes airdrops in its wallet, including the RSIC•GENESIS•RUNE token, because the wallet inadvertently contained specific Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions, according to the on-chain analytics firm Arkham.  The iconic ""Buy Bitcoin"" sign held behind Janet Yellen during her televised Congressional testimony in July 2017 has been auctioned off for 16 BTC, or just over $1 million. Proceeds from the auction will go to fund a Bitcoin layer-2 startup called Tirrel Corp.

The project could lead to the development of layer-2 networks atop Bitcoin without requiring any major changes to the blockchain's underlying code.  Sergio Demian Lerner, an Argentine developer known for his early work on Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin stash, discussed the project Wednesday at the Bitcoin++ developer conference in Austin.  AUSTIN, TEXAS — The founder of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Rootstock has detailed plans for a new ""BitVMX"" project designed to improve the oldest blockchain's programmability by keying off developer Robin Linus's much-discussed ""BitVM"" design unveiled last year.  Sergio Demian Lerner, a Buenos Aires-based programmer known for his early research on Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto's mining activities and later for contributing to the Ethereum blockchain's development, discussed the project onstage Wednesday at the Bitcoin++ conference in Austin, Texas.  ""We have a roadmap to finish this in one year"" and ""we are moving forward at full speed,"" Lerner said during the presentation.  Linus's release of BitVM last year has been widely cited by Bitcoin developers as a breakthrough for the 15-year-old blockchain since it theoretically would facilitate the development of programmable layer-2 networks similar to those that are being used in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem to make transactions cheaper and faster. Key to the project's promise is that BitVM would require no changes to the underlying Bitcoin code – seen as crucial due to the blockchain's decentralized governance, often lacking consensus among developers over major upgrades.  Lerner had disclosed last month during an exclusive interview last week on CoinDesk's The Protocol podcast that he was working with colleagues on the new project without providing details.  Last week, Rootstock Labs published a blog post on the effort, arguing that ""theory and practice are two very different things,"" referring to Linus's original concept.  ""The BitVMX research team intends to build on this initial discovery with additional innovations to create an improved development framework for running programs on Bitcoin,"" according to the blog post. ""The name is a nod to BitVMX’s origins while highlighting its focus on extending Bitcoin and accelerating the development of the next generation of sidechains and layer 2s.""  Rootstock Labs added that ""a team of core contributors is working on a public roadmap of proposed improvements to the network in the next 12 months.""  According to an accompanying whitepaper, ""BitVMX framework provides the foundations to run any CPU on Bitcoin, with a focus to run a fully-compliant RISC-V processor programmable using a standard compilation toolchain"" – a technical description of the new system that boils down to facilitating a ""myriad of use cases.""

42390918,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPz7N,1714583040,Privacy Isn’t Just an Edge Case for Crypto,"If you’re not doing anything dodgy, why are you so resistant to KYC and AML?  This was the last thing I’d expected to hear from a speaker on a panel about “DeFi adoption across Asia.” But that was the response, at a satellite event on the sidelines of TOKEN2049 in Singapore last month, when an audience member asked about the challenges of meeting KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money-laundering) compliance requirements for web3 builders looking to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi).  Blame it on the hot and sticky afternoon weather that was making me cranky, or the glass of sparkling wine I nabbed off the buffet on the way in, but I couldn’t resist the urge to call him out.  Leah Callon-Butler is a CoinDesk columnist and director of Emfarsis Consulting.  “What if you’re someone in a developing country who lacks the necessary ID documents?” I heckled from the back of the event space. The speaker quickly agreed with me, acknowledging that identity verification is a massive obstacle for millions of people across Asia who are unable to open a bank account due to the many rigid and onerous KYC requirements. He added a caveat, however, stating that he still believed identifying and tagging users was essential for the purpose of avoiding illicit activity.  For years, the crypto industry has mulled how to avoid crypto being exploited for nefarious means while staying true to our community’s core ethos of privacy and decentralization. But KYC is known to be horribly ineffective, and the majority of financial crime still goes through the traditional banking world anyway. Meanwhile, public blockchains are open, transparent and immutable ledgers that anyone can access, making it easier for law enforcement to track and trace criminal activity. Pair this with privacy-protecting technologies, such as zero-knowledge proofs, and you’ve got yourself the foundations of a system that could do a much better job of balancing the right to know with the right to privacy.  Read more: Privacy-Enhancing Crypto Coins Could Be Banned Under Leaked EU Plans  In any case, forcing decades-old KYC rules onto crypto today is like taking something that was built for a horse and cart and retrofitting it to a rocket ship, as I wrote in an earlier op-ed for CoinDesk.  Anyway, it wasn’t actually the KYC thing that got me all riled up, and in hindsight I wish I’d not used the example of it being an obstacle to financial inclusion. A quick scan of the room told me the audience was made up of dudes in swanky suits, likely more concerned with taking their investment portfolios to the moon than solving the struggles of the unbanked. As such, my decision to refer to an edge case to prove a point about KYC’s failings served only to underscore that the only people with a good reason to avoid it must be marginalized, oppressed or persecuted in some way. Conversely, if you’re an upstanding citizen with a government-issued ID and a bank account who lives in a politically and economically stable, democratic country, privacy needn’t be your top priority.  After the Tornado  I was reminded of this after reading Neeraj Agrawal’s recent guest post for the Bankless newsletter, titled “Crypto Privacy Is Humanitarian.” In it, Coin Center’s long-time communications head makes a case for encouraging privacy tools such as the U.S. Treasury Department-sanctioned Tornado Cash by demonstrating how “crypto privacy is the difference between life and death” for “those who live in authoritarianism.” He cites a range of examples where crypto’s privacy properties have given “desperate people” a way to dodge the “weaponized intermediaries” that punished them by enforcing choke points in the financial system.  These include protestors in Belarus and Nigeria, Vladimir Putin’s political opposition in Russia, resistance fighters in Myanmar, sanctioned and starving Afghanis, a Chinese dissident artist evading censorship and women at risk of being unable to access abortion in the United States – the latter being a good example of how the line between dodgy and not-dodgy is constantly being redrawn.  Agrawal’s argument is powerful in demonstrating the very real “life or death” situations in which many people across the world unfortunately find themselves. But rattling off all these Orwellian instances where privacy is essential implies that privacy is nonessential for those without an extreme reason to avail it. Further, focusing on a person’s reasons for privacy is somewhat ironic – a form of doxxing in itself. It’s another way of saying that those who skirt KYC are trying to hide something.  Read more: Michael Casey - The Coming Privacy Wars  The narrative suggests that privacy-preserving behaviors exist on a bell curve. At one end of the graph, you have bad guys trying to conceal their crimes. At the other, you have freedom fighters resisting oppression. One is deemed a criminal while the other is a hero but both are unlawful, even if the laws in question are draconian or unjust. More important, for the sake of mainstreaming the right to privacy, neither example is a relatable experience for the mainstream population occupying the normal distribution of the bell curve – that is, all the normies of the world without a Netflix-worthy pitch to justify their privacy.  Privacy aficionados are often painted as conspiracy theorists, tin foil hat-wearing crazies and paranoid gun fanatics, whose chosen topic is incriminating in itself. “Normal people” become suspicious of those who deviate from expectations of disclosure. But publicly shaming people into revealing their private information is a method of social control that grooms complacency, establishing standards of behavior. From this place of nonchalance, it is a slippery slope into a dystopian surveillance state where our personal information can be easily collected and used against us as a tool of oppression.  This is why more movies like ""Identity Thief"" (2003) are needed (it’s a comedy starring Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman, if you haven’t seen it). I endured this cheesy Hollywood movie for the sake of writing this article. I wasn’t a big fan of it, but then I doubt I was the target audience. I can see how it would appeal to a mainstream audience, which is duly needed because so much of the pro-privacy content out there is just preaching to the converted.  The movie does a good job of demonstrating the sensitivity of personal identifying data that is commonly collected via standard KYC processes, how easily this data can be stolen and misused, and the awful ramifications for victims. It also shows remarkable empathy for the societal failures that lead to some criminal behavior being committed in the first place.  If we want to inspire a world where privacy is not an individual’s responsibility but the default feature on every platform we interact with, we need to do a better job of demonstrating how and why privacy is a basic human right for absolutely everyone. People who care about their privacy do not deserve to be called “dodgy,” and no one should need an excuse to protect their identity.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/06/14/privacy-isnt-just-an-edge-case-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba382b9adc0022aed6aeb9b1b5a955f01a060d1d-2061x1546.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26680294,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606036,1714582833,Bitcoin Euphoria Cools Off As BTC Distribution Enters Fear Zone,"Bitcoin has finally broken below the $60,000 support level for the first time in two months. The world’s largest digital asset has largely been in a euphoria phase since the beginning of the year, particularly after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. However, the current consolidation of the price of Bitcoin indicates the euphoria might be fading. According to a new report from Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm, the euphoria surrounding Bitcoin, which has been active for the past 6.5 months, looks to be fading. At the same time, the BTC distribution has entered into the fear zone and investors are now heavily weighted towards selling. Selling Pressure Rises After reaching an all-time high of over $73,737 in March 2024, Bitcoin has declined by more than 18% as investors take profits. This drop in price has been accompanied by a rise in the percentage of addresses holding losses, indicating increased selling pressure. The percentage of addresses making a profit has fallen in tandem from over 99% to 86% at the time of writing. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Bullish Signals, Can It Rally 50% From Here? On-chain analytics platform Glassnode noted in its recent report the consolidation action. According to the Net Unrealized Profit & Loss (NUPL) metric, Bitcoin has been in a euphoria mode very early in this cycle when compared to past cycles. Notably, the NUPL crossed over 0.5 approximately 6.5 months before the just concluded halving amidst hype about Spot Bitcoin ETFs. This is in comparison to the 2021 market cycle, where the NUPL was triggered into a profit zone 8.5 months after the Bitcoin halving. This metric suggests the market is still in its euphoria phase for the last seven months but has cooled off significantly due to correction in the past two months. Interestingly, the report noted a “distinct uptick in net outflows” across all wallet sizes throughout April, indicating the current sentiment among traders. This means traders are now in a sell-side pressure across the board. Furthermore, a majority of short-term (one week to one month) holders have been posting losses on the 90-day +1sd level since March. Source: Glassnode What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? While the “fear” rating may worry investors, a pullback after such a steep price rise is considered healthy by most crypto analysts. Many long-term holders are still holding strong and are waiting for the halving effect to kick in. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $59,899 and is down by 5.35% in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Crypto Funds Mark 3rd Consecutive Weeks Of Outflows With $435 Million In Withdrawals Considering the current cost-basis for short-term holders (STH) is at $66,700, and their realized price is at $59,800, many more holders in this cohort have possibly entered into the loss zone.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Returned To Neutral Levels The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that shows the average sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. This index estimates sentiment by considering five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media data, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $92,190: Crypto Analyst Reveals Path To ATH Target The metric uses a scale that runs from zero to 100 to represent this average sentiment. All values under 46 suggest that investors are fearful, while those above 54 imply a greedy market. The zone between these two cutoffs naturally corresponds to the territory of neutral mentality. Now, here is what the Bitcoin sentiment looks like right now, according to the Fear & Greed Index: The value of the metric appears to be 54 at the moment | Source: Alternative As displayed above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is at a value of 54, implying that investors share a neutral sentiment currently. However, the neutrality is only just, as the metric is right at the boundary of the greed region. This is a significant departure from yesterday’s sentiment: 67. The chart below shows how the indicator’s value has changed recently. The trend in the Fear & Greed Index over the past year | Source: Alternative As the graph shows, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has been declining recently. For most of February and March, as well as the first half of April, the indicator was in or near a special zone called extreme greed. The market assumes this sentiment at values above 75. As the asset price struggled recently, the mentality cooled off from this extreme zone and entered the normal greed region. With the latest crash in BTC, the index has seen a sharp plunge, now exiting out of greed altogether. Historically, cryptocurrency has tended to move against the majority’s expectations. The stronger this expectation, the higher the probability of such a contrary move. This expectation is considered the strongest in extreme sentiment zones, as well as extreme fear and greed. As such, major bottoms and tops have often occurred in these territories. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance: Traders Preferring The OG To Dogecoin & Other Altcoins The all-time high (ATH) price last month, which continues to be the top of the rally so far, also occurred alongside extreme values of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index. With the sentiment now cooled to neutral, some investors may be watching for a fall into fear. This is natural because a rebound would become more probable the worse the sentiment gets now.

42390925,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPzhH,1714579200,‘Sell in May and Go Away’: The Seasonality of Crypto-asset Returns,"Tick, tock, next block. Bitcoin works like clockwork as they say. Approximately every 10 minutes a new block of transactions is timestamped into the public ledger.  Obviously, time plays an important role in Bitcoin’s protocol. But what about the seasons?  Traditional financial research provides ample evidence for seasonality in equity returns. You have probably come across terms like the “January Effect” or “Turnaround Tuesday.”  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Seasonal performance patterns that are statistically significant can be observed on almost any time frame: Quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, and so on.  The saying “sell in May and go away” has already been around since the nineteenth century, as the summer months tend to have shown a remarkable weakness in equity returns historically compared to other months of the year.  A look at Bitcoin’s average monthly returns reveals that the summer months between June and September have also shown significantly lower below-average returns.  Why should we care about this?  Well, if you just held cash during the months of August and September (when you were on holidays) and were only invested in Bitcoin during the rest of the year, you would have outperformed a Bitcoin buy-and-hold investor by four times!  Hence, statistically-significant seasonal performance patterns could theoretically be used to derive significant alpha.  Moreover, the average seasonal performance pattern also suggests that Bitcoin could continue to rally over the coming weeks until around June, when the average seasonal performance pattern suggests that bitcoin could make a pause during the summer months before continuing its ascent towards the end of the year.  Having said that, as mentioned above, seasonal performance patterns can be observed on almost any time frame.  In this context, bitcoin seems to have fared best at the beginning of the week (Monday – Wednesday) while the performance towards the end of the week and especially on weekends have historically been below-average.  Similar patterns can be observed during different trading hours: While the performance during Asian trading hours (12 am UTC – 6 am UTC) were mostly below average, European (8 am UTC – 4:30 pm UTC) and American (2:30 pm UTC – 9 pm UTC) trading hours usually show above-average performances historically. That being said, towards the end of the American trading session (9 pm UTC), Bitcoin returns have historically been the worst.  Similar intraday performance patterns can also be observed in the traditional FX market where most of the trading volumes occur during the intersection between European and American trading hours (between 2:30 pm UTC and 4:30 pm UTC).  Bitcoin trades 24/7/365 around the globe but fluctuations in price are ultimately a product of human action. Thus, it is no surprise that “sell in May and go away” seems to apply to Bitcoin’s return profile as well.  While Bitcoin continues to work like clockwork, its performance is ultimately determined by the time we are awake or asleep, when we start working ande when most of us are on holidays or not at work.

42390919,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPzCV,1714579200,An ETH ETF Wouldn’t Deliver Full-Returns to Investors,"ETFs bring awareness but are less effective than private funds as an ETH investment vehicle.  With the recent approval, launch and success of spot bitcoin ETFs, all eyes have turned to the possibility of spot ETH ETF regulatory approval, an outcome we believe to be unlikely under the current administration. Additionally, an ETH ETF will, at least initially, lack a staking reward component, a key aspect of ETH total return.  We see the primary value of crypto-ETFs being the normalization of crypto investing for traditional finance allocators. Large ETF providers entering the space license their legitimacy, allowing allocators to invest in crypto without taking career-risk. However, for all the industry benefits of a spot ETH ETF, the return characteristics are not as attractive as total return options.  At the time of writing, rewards from staking eth are over 3% per annum, according to CESR, the benchmark composite ether staking rate. In other words, if an investor invests into an ETH ETF, they may be at a disadvantage compared to someone investing in a staked investment. CESR has been as high as 8% in the trailing twelve months.

ETH ETFs — A liquidity mismatch due to staking  Mechanically, staking reduces liquidity due to the validator entry and exit queues. In the summer of 2023 the entry queue rose to 45 days due to a surge in activity. As a network security activity, staking is not designed with the liquidity needed for securitization in mind. Due to the immense liquidity demands of an ETF, issuers will struggle to deliver liquidity and ETH total return, including staking rewards.  Structural Underperformance  Passively holding unstaked ETH is akin to holding unneeded fiat currency for long periods in a demand deposit account with zero interest. Said another way, passively holding unstaked ETH will create structural underperformance and, if compared to a total return benchmark, persistent negative tracking error. From any angle, that is an untenable position for an investor.  Private Fund Solution  For accredited investors, private funds offer an effective solution to achieve total return ETH exposure. Buying and staking ETH through a private fund structure does not face regulatory challenges. Managers can also match the liquidity of the fund to stake and unstake ETH on behalf of investors. With a thoughtful operational setup, there are limited tradeoffs; a private fund can be audited, benchmarked, and keep assets in qualified custody.

According to the analyst, Bitcoin is at a key junction currently testing the daily Moving Average 100 (MA100) level once more after recovering from it in the past. Historically, the crypto asset has found considerable support at the 100MA level. Should BTC recover from this point on, Captain Faibik anticipates a significant rise on the upside in the upcoming days. Thus, he expects the digital asset to reach a new all-time high within the month. The post read: Last time, BTC bounced back from the daily MA100, and now it is testing it again. If it bounces back from here, we can expect a Bullish Rally in the coming days. New All the High could be incoming this month The crypto analyst noted Bitcoin’s price action in the daily timeframe also suggests that a bullish rise is on the horizon. Faibik stated that on the daily timeframe chart, BTC is still moving above the major trendline and inside the green box indicated in his chart. As a result, the analyst expects BTC to undergo a quick comeback. Related Reading: If History Repeats, This Is How Bitcoin Price Will Perform In The Next 6 Months Another notable finding from Captain Faibik is that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been drifting below a trendline that has been in place for some months. Although this might indicate a brief waning of positive momentum, Faibik interprets it as a sign of an impending price recovery for Bitcoin. Given that BTC is still moving inside the bullish flag pattern, the expert anticipates a bounce back towards $68,000 in the upcoming days. $100,000 Price Target For BTC Captain Faibik’s most bullish target for BTC recently is the $100,000 price mark. Last week, Faibik pointed out key narratives that could catalyze Bitcoin’s price to $100,000 in the coming months. According to the expert, the presence of bullish investors in the market was the reason why BTC was trying to make a comeback in the previous week. Thus, for a significant price increase to $100,000, these investors must retake the crucial resistance level of $72,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Outlook: Analyst Foresees Peak In Late 2025 Furthermore, Faibik highlighted that BTC Bulls have solidly secured the weekly Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 10 following the October 2017 Descending Channel breakout. Due to this, the crypto analyst is setting $100,000 as the digital asset’s next price target. Following a decrease of more than 13% over the previous 7 days, the price of Bitcoin is currently trading at $57,701. In the last day, its market cap has plummeted by over 6%, while its trading volume has increased by about 61%.

The bank said bitcoin is now trading below the average spot ETF purchase price of $58K.  Risk assets like crypto are feeling the pinch due to rising macro headwinds and falling liquidity.  Bitcoin’s {{BTC}} breakdown through the $60K technical level opens the way for another move lower to the $50K-$52K range, investment bank Standard Chartered said in emailed comments on Wednesday.  The driver of the move lower seems to be a combination of crypto specific factors and macro influences, the bank said. Bitcoin was trading 6% lower at around $57,200 at publication time.  There have now been five consecutive days of outflows from U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the bank noted, and BTC is currently trading below the average ETF purchase price of about $58K.  “This means that more than half of the spot ETF positions are under water and so the risk of liquidation of some of them must be considered as well,” analyst Geoff Kendrick wrote.  The bank notes that headlines around the Hong Kong spot ETF launch were also poor, as attention was focussed on the turnover volume of $11 million “rather than the net asset position of the new ETFs which was pretty good.”  Risk assets such as cryptocurrencies, which thrive on liquidity, are also facing increasing macro headwinds, the bank said. It noted that broader liquidity measures in the U.S have deteriorated sharply since mid-April.  The bank advises buying bitcoin if it reaches the $50K-$52K range or if U.S. CPI on the 15th, a measure of inflation, is “friendly.”  Read more: Bitcoin ETF Slowdown Is a Short-Term Pause Not the Beginning of a Negative Trend: Bernstein",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/01/bitcoin-could-drop-further-to-as-low-as-50k-standard-chartered-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72ae280e7f877c015503d0e65549a58cf333d430-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

26671243,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605855,1714570204,Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price For May 2024,"As April comes to a bearish close, expectations for Dogecoin in May are not exactly bullish, especially as the crypto market has continued to fall. DOGE has been one of the main losers during this time, falling below $0.14. This underperformance is expected to continue as the machine learning algorithm at CoinCodex predicts further decline for the meme coin. Algorithm Predicts Another 13% Decline Despite the Dogecoin price already suffering a notable 14% decline in the last week, the machine learning algorithm believes it will fall another 13% in the month of May. The machine learning algorithm, which takes a number of metrics into consideration, presented that the DOGE price remains very bearish despite the market still sitting in greed. For the month of May, the algorithm expects the meme coin’s price to decline by a total of 13.66% from here, falling below $0.13 to $0.1238. Even on the shorter term, the Dogecoin price remains bearish with an expected 1% decline to $0.14 in the next five days. On the broader timeframe, expectations for the meme coin are not high as the machine learning algorithm does not expect the cryptocurrency to reach a new all-time high until 2029. For the year 2025, it gives the meme coin a yearly high of over $0.66, which is less than its current all-time high price of $0.7. The next two years after this are expected to be bearish as the price is predicted to fluctuate around $0.126 and $0.25. Then, a new all-time high price of $1.4 is expected. If this plays out, then it would mean that Dogecoin investors would have to wait another five years to see new peaks. Dogecoin Metrics Tell A Different Story While the machine learning algorithm remains bearish, the Dogecoin metrics have been painting a picture of bullishness. For example, there has been a steady increase in the Dogecoin trading volume, rising 28% in the last day alone. This suggests a return of investor interest and if it translates into demand, it could see the price rise rapidly from here. There has also been an accumulation trend for the meme coin, especially among whales. One whale, in particular, withdrew 226 million DOGE from the Robinhood exchange in two transactions. Usually, when investors move coins from exchanges to private wallets, it means they are accumulating for better prices. This could signal a turn in the tide. However, at the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is still struggling at $0.135, with a 4% drop in the last 24 hours. A reversal from here could see DOGE retest the $0.15 resistance. But a breakdown could send it back toward $0.12.

Holding leveraged funds like BITU for too long can result in underperformance and long-term capital erosion due to decay. BTC is currently correcting. Trying to catch the knife in BITU may lead to deep losses while BTC finds a bottom. Just 15 years into its existence, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has catapulted from a niche cypherpunk computer project to a global powerhouse, valued by the market at $1.2 trillion. With the increase in valuation and market interest comes an increase in the amount of proxies and derivatives available to speculators. One such product is the Proshares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ). Fund Objective & Details BITU was launched by ProShares on April 2nd, 2024. AUM: $121 million Expense ratio: 0.95% The goal of BITU is fairly straightforward. Before fees and expenses, BITU shareholders are attempting to generate 2 times the daily reward of the price of Bitcoin. So if BTC increases by 5% in a given day, BITU would theoretically increase by 10% in the same day. Thus, BITU is a 2x leveraged Bitcoin ETF and is primarily intended for short-term traders and not for long-term investment. Data by YCharts Since the fund is still relatively new, BITU holders who have been in the fund since inception are down 12% while BTC is down closer to 9%. While not as dramatic an underperformance as is possible with a 2x ETF, this does highlight the long-term risk in holding leveraged funds for too long. Risks with Leveraged ETFs Leveraged funds like BITU are rebalanced daily. When a 2x long fund is leveraged against a sector or asset that is in a sustained uptrend, the leveraged fund shares can work beautifully at maximizing gains for short-term trades. However, the opposite is also true to the downside. A 2x long strategy tracking an asset going down doubles the pain. But in order to win, leveraged ETF holders need a sustained uptrend. Chop won't work. That's because shareholders of leveraged funds also lose when the sector or asset experiences directional ambiguity. In a prior article covering the GraniteShares 2x Long COIN ETF ( CONL ), I detailed how long-term decay works with these funds due to daily rebalancing. In that note, I shared a table showing how it only takes a few weeks of holding before the leveraged shares start underperforming the intended strategy, even if the sector or asset can have a positive total return. For the sake of prospective BITU buyers, I've updated that table to show it would look here: Author's calculations In the example above, we're looking at 20 days of back and forth 5% intraday BTC moves that generate 10% back and forth moves in the BITU shares. By Day 20, BITU has underperformed BTC, though both are still marginally higher than from where they started. This illustrates why BITU and generally all 2x funds like it are poor long-term investments and shouldn't be held for a longer than a few days at a time. Unlike CONL which intends to track with shares of Coinbase ( COIN ), BITU shareholders have a greater risk of missing out on potential BTC gains due to the fact that the market for BTC doesn't actually close. This risk is highlighted in the Summary Prospectus in the Market Price Variance Risk section: As a result, the value of the Fund’s holdings may vary, perhaps significantly, on days and at times when investors are unable to purchase or sell Fund shares. For example, if Bitcoin rallies by 10% over the weekend and then falls back down to its Friday level, BTC will be even but BITU shareholders would have missed a 20% rally in the fund shares. This is also a risk for spot ETFs as well, but those fund objectives are different and meant for longer term holding rather than short term trades. Bitcoin Correction Given the obvious risks with buying BITU, timing is the most important factor and I suspect even short-term traders likely want to avoid this fund with BTC showing signs of an imminent deeper correction. Fundamentally, spot ETF flows started turning negative in April: The Block According to data from Farside Investors , daily net flows in the spot Bitcoin funds have been negative 9 out of the last 12 sessions as of April 29th. Up until recently, the only spot ETF that was experiencing outflows was the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). However, April has seen more of the other funds now turning to net outflows as well. This is an indication that investment demand for BTC has started to reverse, with the block reward halving now in the rearview mirror. BTC Daily (Investing.com) Technically, I see additional downside for Bitcoin in May as the coin retests important moving averages and prior areas of resistance. Consider the 50 DMA curling lower, the MACD crossing back down and the fact that the RSI has yet to hit oversold territory as it is still only at 37. Given the interest rate environment and general weakness in the equity market, I don't think BTC will be immune from further declines if the broader market is in risk-off mode, as I suspect it currently is. The point is, this is not an environment where I'd want to be trying to catch knives in BITU. Closing Summary BITU is not a fund for long-term investment. It could actually be a terrific trading instrument for short term tactical buyers, but we have yet to see the fund perform well for bulls since it's still such a new ETF. Not only are spot ETF investors starting to take profits, but the technical setup indicates further downside in BTC, in my opinion. Furthermore, I don't think the time is right to long BITU given the macro setup. September Rate Probabilities (CME FedWatch) The broader financial markets have been expecting numerous interest rate cuts in 2024, and we have yet to get a single one. In fact, the market is now pricing in the possibility that the Federal Reserve won't start cutting until September. In my view, this is going to further weight on risk assets like BTC. I'm still bullish BTC longer term. But in my view, it's best to express that idea through the spot ETFs for now and wait for a more clear indication of a trend shift back up before speculating with BITU.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4687936-proshares-ultra-bitcoin-etf-bitu-not-time-to-be-long?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26670948.jpeg

The research made use of 122,000 groups of connected nodes and chains of transactions called ""subgraphs"" with known links to illicit activity.  Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said it detected potential money laundering patterns on the Bitcoin blockchain after training an artificial intelligence (AI) model using a record 200 million transactions.  The work is an extension of a program carried out back in 2019 that used a dataset of only 200,000 transactions. The much larger ""Elliptic2"" dataset made use of 122,000 labeled ""subgraphs,"" groups of connected nodes and chains of transactions known to have links to illicit activity.  AI becomes more insightful the larger the dataset available to train the machine-learning algorithms, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer a plentiful supply of transparent transaction data on the blockchain. Elliptic used the transactions for learning the set of ""shapes"" that money laundering exhibits in cryptocurrency and accurately classifying new criminal activity, Elliptic said in a paper co-authored with researchers from the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.  ""The money laundering techniques identified by the model have been identified because they are prevalent in bitcoin,"" Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson said in an email. ""Crypto laundering practices will evolve over time as they cease being effective, but an advantage of an AI/deep learning approach is that new money laundering patterns are identified automatically as they emerge.""  Many of the suspicious subgraphs were found to contain what are known as ""peeling chains,"" where a user sends or ""peels"" cryptocurrency to a destination address, while the remainder is sent to another address under the user's control. This happens repeatedly to form a peeling chain.  ""In traditional finance this is known as 'smurfing,' where large amounts of cash are structured into multiple small transactions, to keep them under regulatory reporting limits and avoid detection,"" Elliptic said in the paper.  Another commonly occurring technique was the use of so-called ""nested services,"" businesses that move funds through accounts at larger cryptocurrency exchanges, sometimes without the awareness or approval of the exchange. A nested service might receive a deposit from one of their customers into a cryptocurrency address, and then forward the funds to their deposit address at an exchange.  ""Nested services are known to frequently have less stringent customer due diligence checks than the cryptocurrency exchanges they utilize, or sometimes have no such anti-money laundering checks at all, resulting in their misuse for cryptocurrency laundering - potentially causing them to feature in subgraphs deemed by the model as suspicious,"" said Elliptic.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/01/blockchain-sleuth-elliptic-explores-ai-and-anti-money-laundering-using-200m-bitcoin-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b45126084cf756e53a46a3b02e9abe43ff1e8a99-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) sank below $58,000 during the European morning on Wednesday to the lowest level since the end of February. BTC has fallen around 6% in the last 24 hours having dropped below the $60,000 support level late on Tuesday. The wider crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), has lost more than 5%. Cryptocurrencies have been dogged by risk-off sentiment in the broader financial markets amid a stagflationary feel in the U.S. following indications of slower growth and sticky inflation that have tapered hopes of an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Open Market Committee is due to give its latest rate decision later today.  Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao was sentenced to four months in federal prison on Tuesday having pleaded guilty to charges of enabling money laundering at the crypto exchange. The relatively lenient punishment (prosecutors had sought a three-year sentence) could be attributed to the positive image of the man that his defense lawyers had crafted as a philanthropist, family man and first-time lawbreaker. U.S. Judge Richard Jones said he didn't think he'd ""ever seen a volume of letters"" of support from friends or family for a defendant, such that the book in which they were contained literally fell apart.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler was accused of misleading Congress by Rep. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who said Gensler's agency already knew it considered Ethereum's ether a security before he attended a hearing and declined to answer that question. ""Chair Gensler refused to answer questions regarding the SEC's classification of ether,"" McHenry said in a statement posted on X on Tuesday. ""New court filings show this was an intentional attempt to misrepresent the commission's position."" The classification of ETH is a major question hanging over the U.S. oversight of digital assets. If ETH is a security that should be registered and regulated by the SEC, then many other tokens may also fit that definition.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows that BTC's price is now below the average ETF purchase level.  This means that more than half of spot ETF positions are underwater, and the risk of their liquidation must be considered.  The break below $60,000 therefore reopens a route to the $50,000-$52,000 range.

42390922,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPzRt,1714564860,"Restaking 'Gold Rush' Spreads to Solana From Ethereum, With Jito and Others Joining In","Restaking, an already hot service on the Ethereum blockchain, is now entering the Solana ecosystem, bringing profit-making opportunities but also risks.  Jito, a Solana-based project, is building a restaking service, four people familiar with the matter said.  A CoinDesk investigation found half a dozen teams quietly building out Solana restaking.  The crypto restaking craze is spreading from Ethereum {{ETH}} to Solana {{SOL}}, opening up money-making opportunities for investors and luring big players like Jito {{JTO}} and a handful of newcomer teams.  Ethereum and Solana are both proof-of-stake blockchains, meaning their networks are secured by a decentralized community of operators, often called validators, who pledge, or ""stake,"" ETH or SOL, respectively, for a financial reward.  Crypto's billion-dollar startup darling EigenLayer took this trust concept and literally leveraged it with restaking. Now, crypto investors could stake their idle ETH tokens to secure pretty much anything (and get some extra yield in the process). They did so with abandon: EigenLayer hoovered up $15 billion of ETH capital in less than a year.  Read more: Restaking 101: What Are Restaking, Liquid Restaking and EigenLayer?  The same game is poised to emerge in the Solana ecosystem in the coming weeks and months.  Solana infrastructure project Jito is building a restaking service, four people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. The yet-to-be-announced program is set to compete against a growing stable of companies all trying to replicate EigenLayer's magic outside of the Ethereum ecosystem.  ""There's a lot of hype around it right now. It's kind of like a gold rush,"" said Jito Labs CEO Lucas Bruder, while declining to comment on his company's plans.  Read more: EigenLayer, After Touching Off Restaking Frenzy, Plans Own EIGEN token  Restaking on Solana is so nascent that major protocol developers and even insiders at the influential Solana Foundation said they have yet to delve into the companies trying to bring it to their realm.  Nevertheless, a CoinDesk investigation found over half a dozen teams quietly building out Solana restaking. Some are hewing closely to EigenLayer's core design: a mechanism for many different crypto protocols to share the economic security of the blockchain's native token.  Interviews with the teams building this infrastructure, investors evaluating it and startups who might utilize it showed how Ethereum's trickle-down tech is being reimagined for Solana. Nevertheless, doubters fear restaking brings little benefit to Solana and fret it could build a financial house of cards.  Solana's restaking scene has no big kahuna just yet. Jito contends with two hush-hush companies raising capital from venture capital firms (Solayer Labs and Cambrian), one Cosmos-centric team whose system is already live (Picasso) and at least two hackathon teams (DePHY and Repl). They're all eager to catch the Solana restaking wave – if it comes at all.  Restaking emerges  Restaking is the latest answer to the security question at the heart of everything in crypto: how to use economic games to protect decentralized computing systems.  Validators earn interest as a reward, and their stake acts like collateral: If a validator tries to lie to the blockchain, a portion of the stake gets revoked (or ""slashed"") by the network.  What it all boils down to: The cost of attacking the system is roughly the amount of money staked in its defense. That's why Ethereum is considered so safe: there's over $100 billion worth of ETH staked. Solana, too, is well-regarded in part because of its mammoth $42 billion stake.  Restaking promises to apply this economic game to pretty much anything, leveraging the big staking numbers on incumbent protocols to help secure upstart blockchain services. Rather than 100 projects being separately secured by, say, $1 billion each, via restaking they could all be protected by their collective $100 billion.  While EigenLayer's restaking systems mostly benefit Ethereum scaling solutions – the so-called layer-2 blockchains built atop Ethereum and designed to augment its abilities – the restaking schemes being built for Solana are generally focused on applications. That's partly because Solana isn't seen as fragmented as Ethereum; it isn't dependent upon, and subservient to, a vast array of layer-2 blockchains.  One builder, Nicholas Deng of hackathon contestant DePHY, which raised $2 million in January, said restaking could provide ""better security for applications.""  Major venture capital firm Multicoin Capital – one of the most influential names in the Solana ecosystem with investments in many protocols, including the network itself – has its doubts. In an interview, Managing Partner Tushar Jain said he's yet to see the commercial problem that restaking solves.  ""Something that literally no developer has come to us and said is, 'You know why users aren't using my product? It's because there isn't enough economic security backing the consensus behind my protocol.'""  Head of the pack  Jito's plans for restaking remain cloudy. The company behind the massively popular client hasn't publicly committed to entering the restaking game. Bruder declined to comment on its plans beyond saying Jito is ""thinking a lot about it.""  The revelation nonetheless puts Jito in a strong position for early dominance of the Solana restaking scene. Jito has a strong reputation among protocols and validators; over 73% of stake-weight, or the proportion of SOL tokens pledged to secure the Solana blockchain, run on validators that use Jito technology. Its distribution of JTO tokens in December kicked off the ongoing rush of Solana ecosystem airdrops. This made it a household name among airdrop farmers, a core contingency of stakers and restakers.  Jito's still-unannounced vision for restaking includes SPL assets (the Solana equivalent of Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens), one DeFi team familiar with the plans said.  ""I believe in the economic security of Solana. But I also believe that governance tokens from protocols can be used for economic security, as well,"" Bruder said.  Plenty of investors believe in Jito. Two venture capitalists who asked to remain anonymous said Jito ""has the best shot out there"" because its team is intimately familiar with Solana's architecture, and the Solana community with it. ""There's a lot of skepticism within the community about non-Solana native teams pulling this off,"" one of the VCs said.  Cambrian  Cambrian founder Gennady Evstratov told CoinDesk his seven-person team is finalizing a $2.5 million fundraise. The valuation is around $25 million, three investors said.  Cambrian seeks to be for Solana what EigenLayer is for Ethereum: a security layer that uses restaking to support all sorts of ""middleware"" that isn't happening on the main chain. Its pitch deck from February proposes use cases spanning off-chain computation and zero-knowledge proof processing.  ""I wouldn't deny that we are inspired heavily by the EigenLayer model, but we are more than that,"" including a computation layer, he said. He compared Cambrian to a ""decentralized"" Amazon Web Services. ""It can be used to create lots of services out of the box to serve as a computational and security layer for different parts of the ecosystem.""  Within weeks, Cambrian will open up its testnet, he said. He's keeping a close eye on competitor Solayer Labs, whom he estimates is lagging behind Cambrian in its tech stack.  Solayer Labs  Whether that's the case is hard to tell. Like most of the teams interviewed for this article, Solayer Labs has not launched yet – let alone open-sourced its codebase.  Three venture investors familiar with the matter said the Delaware-incorporated, months-old company was looking to raise $8 million at an $80 million valuation in a seed round. Polychain Capital is leading the fundraise with a $4 million check, one investor said.  Solayer Labs' Rachel Chu would not share the final terms, but she told CoinDesk the startup is close to raising $10 million, with one check coming from Anatoly Yakovenko, one of Solana's founders and figureheads. (Yakovenko didn't respond to a request for comment.) His participation is a sign of embrace for a team that doesn't have deep Solana roots. Chu was previously a core developer at Ethereum-based decentralized exchange SushiSwap, while her business partner Jason Lee built Ethereum wallet service MPCvault.  ""Ultimately the problem we're trying to solve is scaling Solana,"" Chu said.  An April 8 blog post outlined Solayer Labs' plans to build ""a network of app-chains secured through Solana's economic security and execution"" whose users will be able to customize their environment: ""App builders at scale want more [transactions per second], less competition for blockspace, lower fees, and the aggregate economics that their business generates.""  ""Solana has premium vertical stack features,"" she said in a Telegram message on April 29. ""At the same time, we will see different strategies toward creative scaling solutions to efficiently distribute the workloads.""  Chu said Solayer's upcoming Shared Validator Network could include Actively Validated Services (AVS) that secure Solana infrastructure. ""The initial AVSs we're excited about are MEV strategies, distributed computing and oracle networks,"" she said.  A company blueprint calls for at least four experimental MEV-focused AVSs, including one that would auction ""the right to extract MEV"" and another that would police the MEV space. It also outlines a ""decentralized GPU cluster"" and an AVS that would task node operators with transaction sequencing, among other proposals.  Picasso  Picasso started building a restaking mechanism half a year ago and opened Solana's only functioning product earlier this month. Executive Director Henry Love claimed Picasso is ""probably at least 12 to 18 months ahead"" of Cambrian and Solayer Labs.  Picasso's road to restaking came a little backward. Instead of setting out to build a generalized platform through which anyone could secure anything, it first sought a way to secure its own piece of tech: a bridge connecting Solana with the Cosmos {{ATOM}} family of blockchains.  EigenLayer told Picasso it was keeping its system limited to Ethereum, according to Love, so the company started building its own restaking hub and AVS. Restakers had deposited $8 million worth of SOL and a handful of liquid staking tokens by press time.  His plan is to open Picasso's staking hub to other teams and builders that want to secure their crypto contraptions on Solana, Love said.  Points, points, points  Staking aside, crypto's most prominent economic game is its players' eternal search for gains. Traders are unyielding in their hunt for high-returning capital routes through which to jam their tokens. Airdrop hunters in the EigenLayer ecosystem believe the points they're accruing through restaking will one day grant them tokens – another source of yield. This paradigm is set to play out again on Solana.  ""The winner is decided not by anything but yield,"" Love said of the coming battle between Solana's restaking protocols. His team at Picasso is running a gamified rewards program through its Mantis interface that increases yields for winners.  Cambrian plans to run a points program and release a token after its restaking network launches late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter, Evstratov said.  Solayer Labs has its own multistage points program in the works. As described in its documentation, early birds will get a staggering leg up on latecomers. Depositors in Solayer's first phase (whitelisted for ""our earliest supporters"") will have two weeks to deposit as much as they wish for three times as many points as in later rounds. Those later rounds will have caps on total value locked, or TVL, and smaller points multipliers.  Jito doesn't stand to inspire the same airdrop hunter calculus as the others. It already airdropped its JTO token last year.  ""When that party's over – when inflationary emissions and tokens are given out as points or whatever – you need to look for places that have real revenue and real value-add. And the piece of that going back to the restakers will determine which platform is going to get the most restakers,"" Love said.  Restaking skepticism  But deep skepticism remains across the Solana ecosystem. Ethereum's reliance on layer-2 networks to function and its hulking base of staked assets make restaking especially useful there, said Ryan Connor of Blockworks Research. He thinks of Ethereum as a ""modular"" blockchain; it performs one task while outsourcing other things to layer 2s – the kind of thing that makes it ripe for restaking, since a shared pool of assets might be the only way to secure such a sprawling expanse of interconnected infrastructure projects.  Solana, meanwhile, is an ""integrated"" blockchain that tries to do everything in one place. ""It isn't to say there is *no* need on Solana, just far less of a need than Ethereum and other modular systems"" that could use restaking, he said in a Telegram message.  Fearful naysayers fret that restaking is crypto's latest ticking time bomb – a rehypothecation of trust that will inevitably collapse.  They point to the specter of contagion risk: the idea that if an operator is slashed by an AVS, the impact could ripple across the entire staking ecosystem, depleting the value of the entire restaking pool and cutting down the security of every other AVS as a result.  There's added risk from ""liquid restaking"" services – intermediaries that take deposits from users, restake them into EigenLayer and equivalent platforms and offer receipts, called ""liquid restaking tokens"" (LRTs), that can be traded in decentralized finance to earn even larger yields.  With the rise of LRTs comes an even larger fear of a mass catastrophe: If protocols start leveraging people's trust by allowing them to stake SOL, its liquid staking tokens and also liquid restaking tokens, then the surface area for a rehypothecation crisis grows. One slashed AVS or depegged asset could topple many.  One prolific angel investor in Solana projects told CoinDesk he had not yet invested in any restaking teams. When asked why, he responded cheekily: ""Just debating when restaking blows up crypto.""

26666973,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605983,1714563768,"Bitcoin Price Dips Below $57,000: 4 Key Reasons","Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a significant drop, falling to $56,556 during Wednesday morning in Europe, marking the lowest point since late February. This downturn represents the sharpest monthly decline since November 2022, with BTC tumbling approximately 7.5% within the last 24 hours and breaching the previously stable $60,000 support late Tuesday. #1 Derisking Before Today’s FOMC Meeting Anticipation and anxiety are high in financial circles as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to announce its interest rate decision later today. This event is crucial as the crypto market, notably Bitcoin, has grown increasingly reactive to macroeconomic signals. Recent data, reflecting a slowdown in GDP growth coupled with persistent inflation, has significantly reduced expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. “Bitcoin and other risk assets are currently feeling the pressure from a stagflationary environment, geopolitical tensions, and seasonal liquidity variations,” remarked Ted from TalkingMacro. Related Reading: If History Repeats, This Is How Bitcoin Price Will Perform In The Next 6 Months Initially, up to seven rate cuts were anticipated by the end of 2024, a sentiment that has shifted dramatically with the market now pricing in only one potential cut by December 2024. This shift comes amidst an environment where inflation data is trending upwards, challenging the Federal Reserve’s position and potentially leading to a more cautious approach from Jerome Powell, the Fed Chairman. “For the first time in recent memory, the market is calling the Fed’s bluff, quickly front-running the idea that the Fed may not cut at all in 2024,” noted Ted. #2 Cyclical Bitcoin Correction Phase Following an exceptional rally since the year’s start, the market is undergoing a natural correction phase. Prior to the price crash, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, noted: “We are a day short of breaking the record set in 2011 for days without a meaningful dip [-25%],” emphasizing the extraordinary nature of Bitcoin’s recent performance. Scott Melker, known as “The Wolf Of All Streets,” highlighted technical indicators that suggested an impending correction. “Broke and retested range lows as resistance. My biggest concern I have been discussing for months [was] that RSI never made the trip to oversold. Almost there now, all lower time frames oversold. This is still ONLY A 23% correction, very shallow for a bull market and consistent with other corrections on this run. We are yet to see a 30-40% pull back during this bull market, like those of the past.” $BTC Daily Broke and retested range lows as resistance. Nothing but air until around $52,000 on the chart.

In the United States, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faced substantial outflows, indicating a cooling investor sentiment. Related Reading: USDT Dominance Falling, Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Reach $80,000 According to recent data, the total outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $161.6 million. Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced outflows of $93.2 million, while Fidelity and Bitwise registered outflows of $35.3 million and $34.3 million, respectively. BlackRock had zero net flows once again. These numbers suggest a retreat in institutional interest, which has traditionally been a bulwark against price volatility. Parallel to the US, the debut of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong also faltered significantly below expectations. Six newly launched ETFs, intended to capture both Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, collectively reached just $11 million in trading volume, starkly underperforming against the anticipated $100 million. The spot Bitcoin ETFs accounted for $8.5 million in trading volume. This was markedly lower than the launch day volumes of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, which had reached $655 million on their first day. #5 Long Liquidations The market has also been impacted by substantial long liquidations, with a total of $451.28 million liquidated in the last 24 hours alone. The largest single liquidation was an ETH-USDT-SWAP on OKX valued at $6.07 million, but Bitcoin-specific liquidations were significant as well, totaling $143.04 million, according to data from CoinGlass. These liquidations have amplified the selling pressure on Bitcoin. At press time, BTC traded at $57,715.

Report,"Crypto firms were amongst the sectors that posed the greatest money laundering risk, according to a U.K. government report.  The country has been trying to tackle crypto crime lately, and the police have stationed crypto tactical advisors across the country.  Crypto firms, alongside retail banking, wholesale banking and wealth management, posed the greatest risk of being exploited for money laundering between 2022 and 2023, a report by the government’s financial arm said on Wednesday.  The conclusion from the report came from the Financial Conduct Authority risk assessments on 238 firms. The FCA is a financial regulator in the U.K., and it has been ensuring crypto firms register with it and comply with its money laundering rules since 2020.  The country has been trying to clamp down on crypto-related crime recently. The U.K. police said it had crypto tactical advisors stationed across the country to help seize digital assets attached to crime in October 2022. At the time, the National Police Chiefs’ Council said they had managed to seize hundreds of millions worth of crypto from crimes.  Data from the newly released report showed that between 2022 and 2023, there were the equivalent of 52.8 full-time financial crime specialist employees that were dedicated to anti-money laundering supervision at the FCA and 15.8 of those focused on supervising crypto businesses.  Meanwhile, wider supervisory teams outside the dedicated financial crime specialist teams opened 95 cases in relation to crypto-assets between the reports recording period.

A confluence of a broader crypto market downturn and persistent network congestion threatens to stall its momentum and cast doubt on its long-term viability. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Dive: Will This Spark A Surge In Network Activity? Solana Slides With The Market The recent crypto market correction hasn’t spared Solana. The token, which enjoyed a stellar run for months, has mirrored the overall slump. On Tuesday, April 30th, Solana dipped to $127, marking a daily decline of 4% and a weekly drop exceeding 10%. Lingering Congestion Woes Plague Solana While the market downturn is a concern, a more pressing issue for Solana seems to be its network congestion woes. Recent updates aimed at fixing a bug related to the QUIC protocol haven’t delivered the promised network decongestion. As of April 29th, the transaction failure rate remained stubbornly high at over 65%. This persistent network sluggishness directly contradicts Solana’s core value proposition of high transaction speed and efficiency. Source: Dune Analytics The congestion issues are particularly worrisome for sectors like Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which rely heavily on fast and reliable transactions. Solana has carved a niche for itself in these areas, and prolonged congestion could tarnish its reputation and deter future projects and users. Investor Optimism On Hold, But Long-Term Signals Remain Interestingly, investor reaction to the congestion hasn’t been overwhelmingly negative – yet. Solana’s price movement has largely mirrored the broader market trend, suggesting investors might be taking a wait-and-see approach. SOL 24-hour price action. Source: Coingecko Perhaps there’s a flicker of hope that Solana can overcome these challenges. While the short-term technical indicators paint a bleak picture, some long-term signals, like the 200-day moving averages, still offer a glimmer of optimism. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.082 trillion. Chart: TradingView Solana At A Crossroads The coming weeks and months will be crucial for Solana. Can it address the network congestion issues definitively? Will it be able to regain the trust of developers and investors shaken by the recent performance? Related Reading: Shiba Inu Surprise!

The wider crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), lost almost 9% before recovering some of the decline.  Cryptocurrencies have been dogged by risk-off sentiment in the broader financial markets amid a stagflationary feel in the U.S. following indications of slower growth and sticky inflation that have tapered hopes of an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Open Market Committee is due to give its latest rate decision later today.  Ether {{ETH}} slipped about 5%, dropping below $3,000, while dogecoin {{DOGE}} led declines among other major altcoins with an 9% slide. Solana {{SOL}} and avalanche {{AVAX}} both lost about 6%.  Bitcoin fell in April, returning its first monthly loss since August. The 16% drop was the worst since November 2022, when crypto exchange FTX imploded, but some analysts are warning of further downside in the immediate future.  Digital asset research firm10x Research said it sees selling pressure toward the $52,000 level based on outflows from the U.S. spot exchange-traded funds, which have totaled $540 million since the Bitcoin halving on April 20. It estimates that the average entry price of U.S. bitcoin ETF holders is $57,300, which could therefore prove to be a key support level.  The closer the spot price of bitcoin is to this average entry price, the greater the likelihood of further ETF unwinding, 10x CEO Markus Thielen wrote on Wednesday.  ""There might have been a lot of 'TradeFi' tourists in crypto – pushing longs until the halving – this time is now over,"" he wrote. ""We expect more unwinding as the average Bitcoin ETF buyer will be underwater when Bitcoin trades below $57,300. This will likely lower prices to our target levels and cause a -25% to -29% correction from the $73,000 top – hence our price target of $52,000/$55,000 during the last three weeks.""

26658519,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605926,1714551616,"If History Repeats, This Is How Bitcoin Price Will Perform In The Next 6 Months","In a recent thread on X (formerly Twitter), renowned on-chain analyst Checkmate provided an analysis regarding the future trajectory of Bitcoin. Currently, the premier cryptocurrency hovers around the $60,000 mark, a pivotal moment that echoes historical patterns within the Bitcoin market cycle. What Will The Next 6 Months Bring For Bitcoin? Checkmate argues that Bitcoin is positioned in a “chopsolidation” phase—a term coined to describe a stagnant yet volatile period. He suggests that this could last approximately six months, based on previous cycles, and potentially usher in a period of parabolic growth that could last between six to twelve months. “Bitcoin history tends to rhyme, and thus far, this cycle is no different,” Checkmate noted. “The song sung during the last two cycles paints around 6-months of chopsolidation ahead of us, followed by 6-12 months of parabolic advance.” Supporting his analysis, Checkmate refers to April 2021 as a significant high point for Bitcoin for “many good reasons,” noting that despite a considerable monthly drop of over $8,250 in April, such movements are typical and often signify healthy market corrections. “It’s an -11.2% monthly pullback, and is extremely common during uptrends, and corrections are healthy and necessary,” he stated, reinforcing his confidence in Bitcoin’s resilience and potential for recovery. Related Reading: USDT Dominance Falling, Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Reach $80,000 Further statistical backing comes from historical data focused exclusively on Bitcoin halving years (2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024), which Checkmate used to illustrate that such month-over-month corrections are not outliers but rather common occurrences within the digital asset’s cyclical trends. The end of each year post-halving has historically shown strong performance, supporting the notion that the current price point could be a precursor to significant gains. Sell In May And Go Away? Checkmate also retweeted a post from Charles Edwards. The founder of Capriole Investments commented on the market’s unprecedented bullishness, implying that a deeper correction is to be expected. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $92,190: Crypto Analyst Reveals Path To ATH Target “This is starting to get ridiculous. Bitcoin has not had a run like this since inception. We are now 1 day short of the record set in 2011 for days without a meaningful dip [more than 25%]. If you are not prepared to accept some downside in this asset class, you shouldn’t be here. Especially now,” said Edwards. His remark highlights the unusual lack of severe downturns in the market, suggesting that investors should be prepared for potential volatility. In another post on X, Edwards added a cautious note to the otherwise optimistic outlook. He advised, “Sell in May and go away. This looks like distribution to me. As long as we trade below $61.5K, scenario (1) is technically more likely. A strong reclaim of $61.5K would give some hopes to the bulls for scenario (2). A flush would also be good for the sustaining continuation of the bull market, the sooner we get one, the better the long opportunities are.” This perspective suggests a strategic withdrawal may be wise in the short term, implying that current market conditions might be more bearish than they appear and that a significant correction could potentially strengthen the market’s long-term prospects. At press time, the BTC plunged to $57,691.

A prominent Japanese Shiba Inu community member, KURO, documented the surge on social media, further fueling the buzz. However, the jubilation proved short-lived. The price quickly stabilized at a much lower point, ¥0.003741 (around $0.000024), highlighting the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market.

A Look Beyond The Listing The impact of the Binance Japan listing on SHIB’s long-term price trajectory remains to be seen. While it undoubtedly increased accessibility for Japanese investors, several factors will determine the coin’s future performance. The cryptocurrency market itself is currently facing headwinds. Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, has seen a significant price correction in recent months, dragging other digital assets down with it. SHIB’s fate is likely intertwined with the overall market sentiment. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.14 trillion. Chart: TradingView The success of the Shiba Inu development team’s ongoing projects, such as the Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain and token burning initiatives, could significantly impact the coin’s value proposition. If these projects gain traction and deliver on their promises, they could attract more investors and drive up demand for SHIB. SHIB price action in the last day. Source: Coingecko The Rise Of Litecoin As A Fiat Onramp Interestingly, the increased focus on fiat-to-crypto gateways like the SHIB/JPY pair coincides with the growing popularity of Litecoin (LTC) as a method to buy other cryptocurrencies.

Though it's heresy to say so, longing ETFs actually make more sense than self-custody in certain scenarios. At $10 average network transaction fees, nearly 19 million of the 54 million non-zero BTC wallet addresses can't move funds. We're now three months since the approval of spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs in the United States market. I don't think it's a stretch to say these funds have been an enormous success from an AUM growth standpoint. Even after adjusting for the asset exodus from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), more than 214k BTC in positive net flow has come into these products in three and a half months. That BTC has a nominal value of over $13.1 billion as of article submission. Spot ETF Holdings (The Block) Despite all of the success, more recently the funds have endured a little bit of BTC net outflow from a handful of the spot ETFs as the market digests the halving and various other developments that could have an impact on Bitcoin's demand. Data by YCharts As speculators are seemingly taking off some risk following a tremendous start to the year from a price appreciation standpoint, I think it's a good time to re-examine some of the important network metrics for Bitcoin and, as a byproduct of those metrics, the bull case for the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ). Major Catalysts in The Rearview Of course, the approval of spot ETFs was an important catalyst for soaking up investment capital demand. The other side of the supply/demand relationship has also been impacted this year through Bitcoin's block reward halving on April 20th. It's been well-covered at this point, but to quickly summarize; Bitcoin was designed to only ever have 21 million coins. For validating transactions, miners have generally been paid through new coin issuance from that 21 million fixed supply - this is known as the ""block reward subsidy."" Every four years Bitcoin's block reward subsidy is cut in half. Bitcoin Miner Rewards (Look Into Bitcoin) Historically, Bitcoin's price increases to new all-time highs 12-18 months following a halving event due to diminishing supply while demand for BTC has generally risen through a price mania that ensues. The argument could certainly be made that much of Bitcoin's post-halving price run already happened due in part to the approval of the spot ETFs. I'm personally not in the camp that the cycle highs have been made. However, I am in the camp that the cycle high will likely disappoint those looking for $400k-$500k BTC prices next year. The Case Against Self-Custody As a digital asset, BTC is designed to not require custodians or intermediaries. Spawning from cypherpunk ethos, self-custody is actually the entire point of Bitcoin. But as the years have gone on, the intended utility of BTC has morphed from peer to peer currency to ""digital gold"" that should be ""HODL'd"" rather than spent. We can certainly debate if this change in direction has been beneficial for long term adoption or not, but it's the reality of the situation and the tradeoffs that come with custody versus self-custody play into decisions about Bitcoin that we make as individual investors and speculators. Consider that utilizing custodians has long been viewed as the risky way to own Bitcoin. ""Not your keys, not your coins"" being the mantra in recent cycles to show that blowups at centralized companies like Celsius ( CEL-USD ), FTX ( FTT-USD ), and Voyager ( VGX-USD ) aren't indicative of Bitcoin's failure but rather a failure of human decision making. I want to be clear about this; I am still of the view that BTC should be self-custodied if the individual holder has the means to do so. But we must acknowledge that if Bitcoin's base layer isn't going to scale for wider usage, average transaction fees will indeed rise when fees become the primary incentive mechanism for Bitcoin miners as the block reward continues to decline. This will have a long term impact on the viability of self-custody if truly decentralized scaling networks don't (or can't) reach a critical mass. We're already seeing what can happen with transaction fees during times of high network demand: Bitcoin Average Transaction Fees (IntoTheBlock) On April 20th, the average transaction fee to move BTC on the network was over $128 - up almost 600% from the prior day. This enormous spike was due to the launch of the Runes protocol on Bitcoin. The hype around that project has since subsided. Still, for the entire week following the launch of Runes, the average transaction fee was larger than $22. We didn't see a single-day average transaction fee price under $10 until April 27th. And for some added context, the average fee between April 1st and April 19th was about $10.60. All of this matters because moving BTC in and out of self-custody requires paying these fees. A $10 transaction fee is totally fine for larger value transactions. But for the majority of people to justify holding BTC in self-custody, these fees are high. Bitcoin Address Value Cohorts (IntoTheBlock) At $10 average fees, nearly 19 million of the 54+ million non-zero Bitcoin wallet addresses are paralyzed. At $100 average fees, nearly 60% of on-chain wallet addresses can't move funds. This is serious risk and shows why the ETF option might actually make more sense for smaller-value HODLing. Consider a speculator who wants to buy $5,000 in BTC. Doing so through an exchange will require an upfront fee and then an additional fee to take custody. If we use $10 as an our base case for average transaction fees and 25 bps as our base case for annual ETF expense, it takes five years to make self-custody more cost-effective than simply buying the ETF: Investor-Absorbed Fees Self-Custody FBTC Coinbase ( COIN ) fee $50.0 - Network fee $10.0 - 1 yr Custody Charge - $12.5 Total $60.0 $12.5 Source: Analyst estimates Then if the self-custody holder wants to sell, they're going to pay these fees again. The cherry on top of all of this is the FBTC allocation can easily be held in a tax advantaged account like a Roth IRA and pay no capital gains taxes on asset appreciation. Reiterating My FBTC Buy Call Though I like a couple of the other funds as well, I maintain that FBTC is my personal preference for Bitcoin ETF exposure. The fee waiver for FBTC is still live currently though that waiver will expire at the end of July. Following that waiver, the fund's expense ratio will be 0.25%. This is not the cheapest expense ratio of the spot BTC ETFs. However, it is certainly still competitive and I suspect Fidelity's fee may ultimately become the cheapest over time because it has a critical advantage over almost every other spot ETF manager - it doesn't rely on Coinbase to custody the asset. This is what I said back in January : While I have almost no concern about Coinbase from a blockchain competency standpoint, using Coinbase for custody does add an additional element of potential risk simply by nature of it being a third party. Again, I don't view this as a significant risk, but I do think it gives Fidelity a long term edge since custody is being done in-house through a subsidiary business. Even though fees have become a bit of a race to the bottom for these ETFs, at a certain point that added layer for these other ETFs may ultimately require a larger cost to the investor. My thinking goes like this; as more retail investors and/or speculators buy BTC through ETFs rather than directly through company's like Coinbase, Coinbase will need to replace lost revenue from its retail exchange business. I suspect the company will look to raise custody fees on the asset managers who are relying on Coinbase for the purchase and storage of the BTC held in the ETFs. Since Fidelity is essentially self-storing, the risk of fee hikes down the line is likely lower compared to other ETF providers. Closing Summary There are big tradeoffs in going long BTC via ETFs like FBTC that are important to consider as well. The investor is at the mercy of market hours and can't necessarily sell when they want to if an exit is desired during the weekend or during a weekday evening. Additionally, FBTC holders aren't ultimately in control of the BTC represented by their shares. But there is no perfect solution to Bitcoin exposure in 2024, in my opinion. As I've illustrated, self-custody clearly has risks, particularly for smaller value holders, and it's not difficult to see how it can be far more expensive to HODL on-chain. Given my belief that miners will require transaction fees to incentivize long-term network security and the possible tax-advantages of buying FBTC in a Roth account, I think FBTC is a solid option for long-term Bitcoin exposure.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4687861-fidelity-wise-origin-bitcoin-fund-etf-the-case-against-self-custody-fbtc?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26651469.jpeg
