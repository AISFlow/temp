42377895,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uS1,1417733151,MasterCard Executive Argues Bitcoin Can't Be Trusted,"In a new video, Matthew Driver, MasterCard’s president for South East Asia, issued a strong rebuke of digital currencies like bitcoin, suggesting that cryptocurrencies carry too many risks to be successful.  Noting that MasterCard is ""not completely comfortable with the idea of cryptocurrencies”, Driver used the video as a platform to blast the technology as ""against the whole principle"" on which the credit card giant has established its business.  Driver argued that bitcoin's design makes it difficult for individuals to both trust that their transactions are safe and have faith in the system at large. He asserted that the ability for individuals to ""guarantee [their] anonymity"" by using digital currencies is especially troubling, a notable comment given that bitcoin has long been recognized as a pseudonymous network.  Driver continued:  ""Trust and security, a stable form of value, are incredibly critical if you’re going to be able to gain acceptance for the services you’re looking to provide. The challenge for cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, is that they’re unstable in terms of their intrinsic value.""  The payments exec went on to use the video, hosted by Singapore-based Channel NewsAsia, as an opportunity to tout MasterCard's services over both bitcoin and cash, stating that his company believes in ""moving to a world beyond cash and ensuring greater transparency and security and simplicity to the way people live their lives"".  The video notably follows MasterCard’s most recent testimony on the subject of bitcoin, a document submitted to the Australian Senate Standing Committee on Economics that called for the application of payment standards that include guarantees on network usage.  'Purpose not entirely clear’  According to Driver, one of the main issues with digital currencies like bitcoin is that users lack safety nets should they run afoul of fraud.  ""[Cryptocurrencies] don't offer, perhaps, the recourse that consumers are naturally expecting that come from using cash in the day-to-day,” he said.  Driver argued that cryptocurrencies ""serve a purpose that’s not necessarily completely clear"", and specifically took aim at bitcoin mining – the process by which a distributed network of computers process transactions – stating:  ""Trust is a critical component of any payment system. So, if you think about the idea that, all of a sudden you have cryptocurrencies being manufactured, if you like, on an anonymous computer in an anonymous location, it’s completely legitimate to have some legitimate concerns about how its working.""  Driver said that regulators want fully compliant payment systems that have clear-cut information on those involved. As much as 77% of the bitcoin mining network, however, has been traced to a known entity or mining address, according to Blockchain.info.  At the close of the video, Driver returned to the subject of anonymity, stating that ""if it’s an anonymous transaction, that sounds like an suspicious transaction"".  “Why does someone need to be anonymous?” he asked.

42377891,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uMz,1417730406,US Marshals: Bidder Turnout in Second Bitcoin Auction Declines Sharply,"The US Marshals Service (USMS), the federal agency charged with managing the sale of property confiscated by federal law enforcement agencies, has released new data on its auction of 50,000 BTC confiscated from alleged Silk Road head Ross Ulbricht and held today.  The USMS data, distributed via email, indicates that the number of bidders in the agency's second bitcoin auction has declined significantly from the first auction held this June.  That auction, which received widespread media coverage in the US and had an observable affect on bitcoin's market, attracted a total of 45 registered bidders, who placed 63 bids over the course of the auction. By contrast, 11 registered bidders participated in today's auction, submitting a total of just 27 bids.  Overall, the number of registered bidders decreased 75% from the first auction, while the number of bids fell 57%.  The USMS indicated that it had no further information regarding the auction or any winning bidders to release at the time it issued the finding, stating:  ""Bids are being reviewed, and the auction is in the evaluation process.""  Notably, the 50,000 BTC (worth roughly $18.6m at press time) is only part of a larger sum of bitcoins taken from Ulbricht at the time of his arrest in October 2013. An additional 94,000 BTC will be auctioned off by the USMS in the coming months, the agency has stated, though the dates for these events have not yet been issued.  Contributing factors  Perhaps accounting for the difference in participation observed between the events was the shorter auction period.  Today's auction began at 8:00 am and ended at 2:00 pm EST, providing bidders a six-hour window within which to submit bids. By contrast, the agency's first bitcoin auction, held 27th June, allowed bidders a 12-hour window, from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm EST.  Additionally, members of bitcoin's investment community had earlier reported a decline in interest among their clients. For example, Binary Financial managing partner Harry Yeh told CoinDesk that he believes the decline is indicative of an overall decrease in the difficulty associated with purchasing large blocks of bitcoin on the open market.  The decline could also reflect increased participation in bidder syndicates assembled by companies in the bitcoin industry. For example, 42 bidders participated in a syndicate headed by illiquid asset marketplace provider SecondMarket in June's auction. Thursday's auction saw at least two syndicates participate, including those launched by the Bitcoin Investment Trust and the trading desk at Digital Currency Group and Mirror.  Previously announced participants in the auction include Binary Financial, Bitcoin Investment Trust, Bitcoins Reserve, Mirror (formerly Vaurum) and Pantera Capital.  Price unaffected  At press time, the USMS auction seemed to have little affect on the price of bitcoin, which was down nearly 1% on the CoinDesk US Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The price of bitcoin also experienced only slight fluctuations over the course of the day, opening at $374.97 and moving between a high of $378.11 and a low of $367.44.  By contrast, June's event coincided with a more tumultuous day in the bitcoin markets, with the price rising 7%, a factor that could be attributed to the bullish sentiment in the community following the successful sale.  Overall, the price of bitcoin has declined from roughly $640 at the time of June's action to a press time total of $371.81 today.

42377903,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uap,1417722952,"Questions Linger as Daily Bitcoin Transactions Pass 100,000 Milestone","The number of daily bitcoin transactions has passed the 100,000 milestone, but questions remain about the exact cause of the spike.  Data from Blockchain shows a total of 102,220 transactions at press time, although other metrics like transaction fees or bitcoin days destroyed do not support it. These two metrics remain relatively flat, while the sheer number of transactions is going up.  Since the charts exclude popular addresses as defined by Blockchain, it is possible that the figure has passed 100,000 on a couple of occasions, but this is the first time such volumes were recorded without popular addresses.  Transaction figures rising steadily  The average number of bitcoin transactions ranged between 50,000–60,000 over the past several months, but it inched passed 70,000 in August, eventually crossing 80,000 in mid-September. Volume tapered off in October, but November saw another increase, including a brief spike over 95,000 transactions in mid-November.  At the time, analyst Tim Swanson said the increased transactions did not serve any commercial purpose and attributed them to a combination of factors.  CoinDesk reached out to Swanson again, who confirmed his earlier analysis, adding that the numbers can be artificially inflated with relative ease.  ""Neither fees to miners nor bitcoin days destroyed have had a similar increase and those are much harder to game,"" he said, adding:  ""For less than $500 a day transaction volume can be artificially inflated by 10,000 or more. In all likelihood it is a combination of an increase in P2SH, Counterparty transanctions, which also hit a new record high; advertisement spam such as metadata within OP_RETURN; mixing, through Coinjoin and Coinshuffle, and mining rewards.""  It should be noted that the hash rate distribution amongst major mining pools has changed in recent weeks. This week also saw the first decline in bitcoin mining difficulty in roughly two years.  No bullish sentiment  An increase in the number of non-commercial transactions can also be caused by different forms of blockchain 2.0 transactions. The ChangeTip hype could not have contributed to the increase, as ChangeTip transactions are handled off-chain.  Whatever the cause may be, raw data suggests the number of commercial transactions is not growing at nearly the same rate.  This also means bullish sentiment may not be justified, as the price has been stagnant for weeks, along with the number of Google Trends and other indicators that usually coincide with volume spikes or price fluctuations.  On the contrary, the number of transactions has been climbing steadily for months while the bitcoin price has remained stagnant.  Disclaimer: This article should not be viewed as financial advice.

42377887,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uKT,1417714154,Proposed US Law Calls For Five-Year Moratorium on Bitcoin Regulation,"HR 5777, a new bill submitted to Congress by US Representative Steve Stockman (R-TX), calls for a five-year moratorium on digital currency regulation within the US.  The bill  , titled the Cryptocurrency Protocol Protection and Moratorium Act, would hold off any “statutory restrictions or regulations” for the five-year period after 15th June 2015. The bill was submitted on 1st December and has since been referred to both the House Committee on Ways and Means and the House Committee on Financial Services.  The draft law also calls for virtual currencies to be classified as traditional currencies under US tax regulations. Currently, the IRS taxes bitcoin holdings as though they were a type of property. Stockman filed a bill earlier this year looking to classify digital currencies similarly to foreign currency.  The timing is notable given the pending finalization of the New York Department of Financial Services's (NYDFS) BitLicense framework, the comments of which were made public on the regulatory group's website yesterday.  In past statements, Stockman said he believes that “New York is putting the cart before the horse” in shaping its regulatory framework.  The section outlining the regulatory moratorium reads:  “Neither the Federal Government nor any State or political subdivision thereof shall impose any statutory restrictions or regulations specifically identifying and governing the creation, use, exploitation, possession or transfer of any algorithmic protocols governing the operation of any virtual, non-physical, algorithm or computer source code-based medium for exchange.”  The clause also calls for ""further suspending the enactment and effectiveness of any and all pending statutes and regulations until the end of the aforementioned moratorium period, except as otherwise provided in this section"".  Pointing to bitcoin benefits  According to HR 5777, the moratorium is needed to fully assess and examine the potential economic benefits of digital currencies.  The draft text suggests that bitcoin may offer the American public economic and technological advantages, and ""may be crucial to overall economic growth"".  Stockman's move to preempt regulatory frameworks both currently in development and in the future reflects prior statements by the Texas Republican, who suggested in previous conversation with CoinDesk that the rules being written for bitcoin today would drive away the individuals and companies needed to ensure its success.  As Stockman commented in July:  “Many [doctors] are dropping out of the profession because it’s overregulated. Now, what may happen to the bitcoin community is that, if there’s so much regulation, there’ll be a lot of people who say, 'You know what, I’m done with this. I’m not gonna do it.' And it’s going to crush the industry.”  Whether the bill will be passed remains to be seen. Following the release of the draft text, Bitcoin Foundation global policy counsel Jim Harper noted on Twitter that the bill may likely fall short due to lack of support and Stockman's pending exit from Congress after his unsuccessful bid for the US Senate.    Don't get too excited. Introduced at the end of a Congress by a departing member. #Bitcoin https://t.co/9rBcHNf2S6      — Jim Harper (@Jim_Harper) December 4, 2014      Push for shift in tax treatment  The moratorium bill contains legislative language that calls for the IRS to treat bitcoin and distributed ledger systems as currencies rather than assets. The bill criticizes the current property-focused tax perspective, arguing that it fails to address the multifaceted characteristics of cryptocurrency.  “Tax treatment of cryptocurrency as property does not account for the substantial liquidity and highly limited acceptance and use of cryptocurrency, and substantially and unfairly discourages taxpayers engaging in a trade or business from using cryptocurrency in commerce,” the text reads.  Stockman's bill, if passed, would require the IRS to revisit and rework its current regulatory framework regarding digital currencies.  Notably, the draft law calls for bitcoin mining income to be taxed as income only at the point of conversion rather than at the point at which bitcoins are created through processing blocks and verifying transactions.  The bill states that, owing to the operational challenge of mining, which includes “the risk that substantial effort may yield no production”, miners should only have to pay taxes on bitcoin revenue “when actual income is realized by a transfer and and conversion of proceeds into dollars”.  CoinDesk has reached out to Rep. Stockman and is awaiting comment on the draft bill.

42377867,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rBT,1417707438,Bitcoin Industry Responds to UK Treasury's Call for Information,"The United Kingdom Treasury's public call for information on digital currencies closed yesterday, after a 31-day consultation period.  The Treasury issued the call on 3rd November after the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in the summer that a ""major programme of work"" would be launched around researching digital currencies and associated technologies.  Now, the UK Digital Currency Association and several companies in the industry have published their responses to the Treasury's call.  The UKDCA's 46-page response underlines the fact that digital currencies should be treated as a 'financial measure' and thus regulated like foreign exchange and gold. It called for a light touch from regulators, arguing that over-regulation would stifle innovation.  The association stresses that digital currencies should not be treated as 'financial instruments' because this would create obligations that are ""too onerous"" for a new industry. However, it says that financial products built on digital currencies, like derivatives, should be regulated as financial instruments.  Not a financial instrument  The UK financial regulator defines financial instruments as transferable securities, money-market instruments and most derivatives, including futures, swaps, options and forwards.  The UKDCA says exchanges should be overseen by the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, and treated as 'payment institutions'.  It also recommends that exchanges be governed by the anti-money laundering regime administered by the tax authority, HMRC. Exchanges currently face difficulty registering with HMRC because their applications as bureau de changes, the category with the best fit, are usually rejected.  The association explains that it is working to develop a set of standards to promote consumer protection and limit market abuse that would operate alongside existing laws.  It has also contacted top certification houses in order to design a 'certification mark' that would operate as a technical standard for the industry, and has asked for government funding to kick-start the process.  The association writes:  ""With government's financial support we will be able to deliver a global standard for digital currency business compliance; combining the best existing ISO standards and new relevant cutting-edge standards.""  Appeal to intervene against banks  The UKDCA has also issued a call to Treasury to ""intervene"" on behalf of digital currency firms so that banks will establish relationships with companies in the nascent sector.  The UK would face dire consequences if it failed to get the regulatory balance for digital currencies right, the UKDCA warns. It named Hong Kong and Singapore as the UK's ""biggest competitors"" for global digital currency businesses. The report points out that Luxembourg is the UK's biggest competitor in the European Union as a base for those businesses.  The UKDCA says:  ""If the UK is too heavy handed, domestic capital will simply move offshore and credible highly scalable digital currency businesses will not move here.""  The UKDCA wrote to members in November explaining that Treasury staffers running the consultation had said a coherent response from the association would generate the most impact. The response was drafted from comments submitted through an online survey by members and at several meetings.  Other responses largely in line  Other published responses to the Treasury call echoed several of the UKDCA's points. Bitcoin exchange Yacuna, which is based in London, advocates regulation of digital currencies with existing laws. It also joins the UKDCA's appeal to the government to ask banks to work with cryptocurrency businesses, saying  ""The UK banking industry is currently blocking access to banking infrastructure and business accounts for businesses related to digital currency.""  Australian startup CoinJar recently relocated to the UK, partly because of a heavy goods and services tax treatment on digital currency purchases imposed by Australian authorities. In its response, it observes that UK banks' refusal to work with digital currency businesses adds unnecessary costs to everyday business.  Neither Yacuna nor CoinJar are UKDCA members, although Yacuna said it was considering joining and CoinJar has only very recently relocated its headquarters to the UK.  A crowd-sourced response posted on the Bitcoin Foundation's forum and signed by several digital currency business owners including ATM operator SatoshiPoint and new UK-focused exchange Mimex, also repeated points raised in the UKDCA letter. These included intervention in the banking sector on behalf of bitcoin businesses and regulation within existing frameworks.  Regulators are making slow but steady progress in their attempts to grapple with the questions posed by the rise of digital currencies.  Yesterday, the New York State Department of Financial Services published more than 3,700 comments it received on its digital currency regulatory proposal, which has been dubbed the 'BitLicense'.

42377879,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rO3,1417702944,Russian Conference Presses On Under Threat of Bitcoin Ban,"Although governments worldwide have been slow to pick up on the advantages afforded by bitcoin, Russia's regulators have been among the most visibly reluctant to acknowledge the technology's potential to enable financial innovation.  Proposed domestic legislation  that would seek to bar consumers and businesses from using digital currencies, and even impose fines for such activities, is still in its early stages, but fear regarding such measures remains a powerful deterrent to the local ecosystem.  In the face of this narrative, Moscow-based exhibition company Smile Expo is holding its second Russian bitcoin conference this year, taking place today at the Ambassador Hotel, St Petersburg.  The one-day conference will see talks on range of topics, from how new users can buy and sell bitcoin, to larger, as-yet-unanswered legal questions.  Despite the uncertain backdrop, conference coordinator Natalie Gavrilenko is optimistic about today's conference, even as the company actively seeks to dispel rumours that have threatened attendance.  Gavrilenko told CoinDesk:  ""We have a lot of worries and fears from our potential visitors and attendees about the possibility they will be added to a 'blacklist' by government. That's why we are trying to educate the public, posting articles, press releases about the legislative status of bitcoin in Russia and publishing interviews from famous lawyers with their opinions.""  Gavrilenko would not comment as to whether attendance figures were affected by recent news, but did suggest the conference has faced difficulties enlisting speakers due to the fact that much of the industry has sought to relocate abroad.  Speakers will include BTCsec founder Ivan Tikhonov, Pvael Rassudov of the Russian Pirate Party, and representatives from local law firm Tolkachev & Partners.  Notably, Smile Expo's first bitcoin conference was scheduled to take place in March, but was rescheduled to April amid concerns that government action would be taken against the technology.  Anonymous registration  Gavrilenko acknowledged that the event may be the last bitcoin conference held in Russia, but stressed that in the meantime, participants face no legal repercussions for attending.  ""Bitcoin Conference St Petersburg is an information and educational event, and attending this event cannot cause any legal consequences,"" she said. ""Attending a conference aimed at providing information is not evidence of any dishonest intent.""  Despite her conviction on this point, the conference itself is allowing attendees to register, participate and pay for the conference without providing any personal information. Rather, Gavrilenko explained, attendees can select and use nicknames for the event.  Smile Expo holds a number of conferences annually that center on all manner of subjects, from 3D printing to robotics and gaming.  Contingency plans  Gavrilenko further affirmed Smile Expo's desire to hold additional digital currency conferences, noting that these could take place outside of Russia. The company has already organised a bitcoin conference in Kiev, Ukraine, this September.  ""In case of a full legislative ban of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin in Russia, we have some ideas about where we can go to told bitcoin expos and conferences,"" she said. ""But we hope that Russian government will not be very fast in their intentions.""  Gavrilenko indicated that Smile Expo is already planning bitcoin conferences in Russia in 2015, with the goal of holding the events in Moscow and St Petersburg.  Gavrilenko also voiced her optimism that this week's event would run smoothly, concluding:  ""For today, there is no active ban, and we have some more time to be free in our bitcoin space and not be punished.""

42377883,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rVb,1417695904,How HelloBit Plans to Become the Uber for Global Remittance,"Remittance, the ability to send cross-border payments from one party to another, has emerged as a major use case for bitcoin, and a number of companies are already seeking to build global remittance platforms using the digital currency.  One of the main reasons is that, according to the World Bank, remittances cost consumers an average of 8% worldwide. Yet, despite bitcoin's potential to lower costs in this financial sector, there hasn’t been a blockbuster venture in this space yet.  HelloBit  is one bitcoin startup taking on a different strategy to achieve this goal.  Instead of creating infrastructure that enables global bitcoin payments, HelloBit has built a consumer app that will connect bitcoin senders to local exchangers. Users can connect with these exchangers, be they individuals or businesses, and receive payments in local currency.  The company's co-founder Ali Goss likens his startup to ride-sharing giant Uber in the way that it seeks to integrate the power of a cellphone service into an existing market.  Goss said:  “The idea is like Uber. You have a cellphone, you can earn money dishing out currency, receive it on the back-end. It’s definitely Uberfication.”  'Bitcoin is remittance'  Goss began working on HelloBit in 2013 when he founded the company with a focus on education.  However, he soon pivoted, believing that to have an understanding of how digital currency could change financial systems for the better, users would need a hands-on tutorial of how bitcoin works.  Goss wanted to build a company to facilitate this process – at that time, he just needed to figure out a solid use case.  ­  After witnessing many companies focus on infrastructure in 2013, Goss decided to focus specifically on consumers. “I didn’t want to do [infrastructure], I wanted to do something else,” he said.  While attending 2013's Inside Bitcoins conference in New York, Goss first learned of bitcoin's potential for cross-border payments.  He recalled:  “I thought, well, bitcoin in and of itself is remittance. So to me that [was] the best value proposition.”  Making the connection  HelloBit is a three-party remittance system. While the sender and exchanger need to have a smartphone, the receiver requires only a feature phone.  The sender transmits bitcoin to a local exchanger using the app. The exchanger then provides the receiver, who gets an SMS code to validate that they are the recipient of the transaction, with local currency.  The concept is sort of like Localbitcoins, but Goss says HelloBit is, “algorithmically built” to score exchangers on a number of metrics. The score calculates an exchanger’s liquidity, hours of operation, availability and trustworthiness, which is derived from user feedback.  The end result is a system that is designed to reduce remittance costs. HelloBit also empowers local exchangers to cater to their recipient customers, somewhat like a mobile Western Union.  HelloBit plans to make money by charging a fee to exchangers on top of what they charge for transactions – the exchanger gets to choose what percentage fee it charges through a sliding scale in the application. HelloBit levies this fee amount in bitcoin.  Taking market share  While developing countries often pay lower amounts for remittance services, in much of the world, a poorly developed banking infrastructure leads to higher costs.  Key to HelloBit's long-term success will be lowering these overall costs and taking market share from existing remittance companies before they see the opportunity for bitcoin.  Western Union, for example, does not see bitcoin as a solution to its cost structure, according to its CIO John “David” Thompson.  Of course, it will have to edge out competition. Ripple Labs has built a node-based distributed payment infrastructure that can exchange virtual currency for fiat currencies through exchanges it calls 'gateways'.  Recently, Mexican bitcoin exchange MeXBT launched at Money 20/20, planning to focus on Latin American remittance.  Additionally, Coins.ph, a Philippines bitcoin exchange, has just released a wallet app that offers cross-border payment capabilities.  Goss said HelloBit initially focused on the Latin American market, but has found substantial interest for the platform in India and the Philippines, and has decided to shift its strategy accordingly.  Tackling regulatory issues  While on the surface attacking the high cost of remittances seems like a surefire business proposition, regulatory issues often plague cross-border payments providers, and this is has been singled out as one of the causes of the industry's high fees.  Nevertheless, HelloBit has been built to be a connector, and leaves the complications of the exchange business to local operators. “We’re just matching the two people for a transaction,” Goss said.  HelloBit's exchangers do have to go through a Know Your Customer (KYC) process in order to be verified into the system and there will be other platform safeguards to limit issues that could arise with money laundering in the process, according to the company.  Goss said HelloBit wants to partner with other companies in the bitcoin space, especially those focused on building remittance infrastructure, to increase global penetration.  “Ultimately, I think there’s a lot to be said about B2B partnerships,” he said.  HelloBit is currently in early signup mode. Interested parties wanting to use the platform can enter in their email address for an early invite on the startup’s website.  The company is planning to waive transaction fees on the first $2,000 for early adopters. The smartphone app will be available for both Android and iOS.

CEO Rick Day told CoinDesk the exchange has ""solid banking relationships"" in the EU, saying there are now over 100 banking options for users to choose from.  As well as the EU, igot indicated that it has also secured a partnership in Kenya and will launch there in the very near future. Kenyan customers will able to cash out from their igot accounts directly to the country's M-Pesa mobile payment system.  Customers in all 40 of igot's serviced countries, Day said, have full access to all exchange features, including the ability to deposit and withdraw from their local banks. The only service not available outside Australia at this point is the popular bill-payment service which accesses the country's BPAY network.  Attracting customers  In an aggressive drive to attract new customers, the exchange recently dropped its buy price to 0% and its sell commission to 0.5%. Igot already does not charge fees for deposits or withdrawals.  Trade volumes, Day said, have leapt 400% to a daily 1,200 BTC since the new pricing scheme launched, and customer signups are showing a new diversity among bitcoin users.  ""A lot of older people and female customers have started signing up. This shows that bitcoin is going mainstream for sure.""  Rapid growth  Igot's expansion has been swift, given that other multinational exchanges like BitX have cited regulatory compliance and banking procedures in different jurisdictions as a speed hump.  Yet, it has still been a time-consuming process, Day said, adding:  ""We spent months working on this. We've secured solid banking relationships, as well has worked with the right partners in each jurisdiction to make sure we're completely compliant in those regions.""  Igot is busy redesigning its home page to reflect the new international flavor, which is set to go live next week.  Chasing remittances  The global remittance market has long been one of igot's main targets, and it is for this reason the company is also targeting the Middle East, with its large populations of foreign workers who are mainly drawn from the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.  The firm  launched the United Arab Emirates' first bitcoin exchange in Dubai in August and plans to expand even further into countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt.  A ""full-fledged remittance strategy"" will launch soon with a bitcoin backend, allowing transfers a sub-1% fee to bank accounts within igot's existing markets.  The firm's largest markets at this stage remain its home nation of Australia and India, where it has a subsidiary office. Liquidity in India, Day said, has ""improved dramatically"" in the past couple of months.  UAE to India is the strongest remittance channel, though the UAE market overall sees a higher volume of bitcoin sell orders than buys.

42377877,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rMn,1417676425,Ripple Labs Partnership Brings Real-Time Transactions to Global Payments Hub,"Ripple Labs has partnered with global payments company Earthport, providing new channels for enterprise access to Ripple’s open-source transaction protocol.  Earthport  specializes in cross-border payments, maintaining one of the largest open networks of its kind. The company’s payments hub features local clearing institutions and payments companies from 60 countries around the world. Additionally, Earthport works with major banking partners like Bank of America, Barclays and BBVA.  The partnership provides Ripple with access to a broader pool of potential customers, all of whom are required to comply with existing anti-money laundering and know-your-customer (AML/KYC) requirements in their respective jurisdictions. According to Ripple Labs, the partnership is another step in its continued focus on enterprise-level clients, especially those in the banking industry.  Earthport CEO Hank Uberoi said that at its heart, protocols like Ripple’s enable what he called “real time communication between the sender and the receiving party.” Uberoi went on to say that his company found Ripple compelling because of its potential to solve chronic issues in cross-border transaction channels that see high volumes.  He told CoinDesk:  “[Ripple] solves a problem that exists today, not necessarily 10 years out. It could gain acceptance today because they’re dealing with many currencies, not just with cryptocurrencies, and that’s important to us because we don’t want to create solutions for which there is no demand today, though there may be some in the future.”  Ripple Labs CEO Chris Larsen called the partnership “a watershed moment” for the company, adding that the move is crucial in its continuing bid for the banking industry to embrace distributed ledger systems.  Inroads into bank network  By connecting to Earthport’s cross-border payments hub, Ripple Labs gains access to a global network of compliant financial organizations.  During the past few months, the cryptocurrency startup has inked deals with US banks that, at the time, expressed interest in open-source transaction technologies because of the need for more cost-efficient access to global money channels.  Larsen said that the move gives institutions the ability to utilize the Ripple protocol through a fully compliant entry point, explaining:  “It’s brought a huge scale of opportunities. It’s great for our existing bank customers, it's great for the banks coming into the Earthport hub, and it accelerates our ability to bring more liquidity on for more and more market makers.”  “It really accelerates the growth of the protocol and the network,” he continued.  Adoption over the long-term  Because “banks move slowly,” according to Uberosi, the Earthport CEO sees adoption happening in stages, with institutions approaching technologies like the Ripple protocol based on the practical benefits to their operations.  Uberoi said that the joint work between the Ripple team and Earthport will make it easier for banks and payments companies, because the steps required to do so – particularly in the areas of compliance and access – will be a lesser-risk endeavour.  Uberoi told CoinDesk:  “People will start to realize that using this combined infrastructure, they can start addressing many needs and problems that exist in the current cross-border paradigm.”  “It will take a little bit of time,” he added.
