42404772,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkWT5,1592858531,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hits $9.6K as Bullish Crypto Sentiment Returns,"Bitcoin’s price is rallying and traders also increasingly see investment opportunities on the Ethereum network.      Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,563 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining 2.5% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Monday (8:00 p.m. Sunday ET), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,298 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. It began making gains around that time, appreciating 3% to over $9,600. The price is now well above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.      A jump in the bitcoin market Monday after days in the doldrums mirrors the longer-term outlook of Fairlead Strategies’ Katie Stockton, who sees an upward trend for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. “Bitcoin remains wound up in its consolidation phase, a reminder why it’s a good idea to await breakouts [and] breakdowns,” Stockton told CoinDesk. “A breakout continues to appear more likely than a breakdown from an intermediate-term momentum perspective and would occur above $10,055 in our work.”      A “consolidation phase” is a term used by technical analysts to mark a period of indecision by traders overall. In fact, according to data from aggregator Kaiko, volatility of the top free-floating cryptocurrencies bitcoin, ether and XRP has trended down since June 7.      “Volume has been muted and volatility is getting coiled,” said Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at liquidity provider Blockfills.      Read More: Bitcoin Spot Volumes Are Weak While Options and DeFi Strengthen      Despite the pop Monday, Van Huis continues to expect selling pressure to affect the bitcoin market due to competition in the mining sector. “If we start to make a move up, it could really be interesting as the race for mining equipment comes into focus. This will play into access to financing or sale of bitcoin to cover new costs,” he said.      “This also could bring some altcoins into focus if bitcoin is battling mining woes,” Van Huis added.      Interestingly enough, bitcoin dominance is down from its 70.5% high in January 2020 and has flattened during June. This suggests Van Huis’ thesis that alternatives, such as assets on the Ethereum network, might be of greater interest to traders in June.    Ethereum network gas prices up    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and which powers the Ethereum network, is also jumping today. Ether was trading around $242 and climbed 5.7% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Decentralized lender Compound and the appreciation of its COMP token is fueling speculative interest, and may be stretching the Ethereum network to its limits and increasing gas prices. On Jan. 1 of this year, the average Ethereum network gas price for running smart contract code was 11.6 gwei [each gwei is worth 0.000000001 ETH). By June 22 that number jumped 157% to 29.9 gwei, with decentralized finance (DeFi) attracting the interest of many traders.      Read More: The Zcash Privacy Tech Underlying Ethereum’s Transition to Eth 2.0      “The Compound coin hype lately is pushing the on-chain gas price,” said Peter Chen, a trader at Hong Kong-based OneBit Quant.      Chan says the demographics of traders on DeFi is shifting and the increase in tether stablecoin usage is a big factor pointing to the change. “We’ve seen a significant increase of USDT trading volume,” he told CoinDesk. “It’s suggesting Asian traders are now pouring into the DeFi market; the majority was U.S. and Europe before.”      Read More: Tether’s Supply on Compound Jumps to Over $224M in a Week    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are all in the green Monday.

42404770,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkWS6,1592851180,Liquidity on Bitcoin Perpetuals Exchange FTX Catches Up to Industry Leader BitMEX,"For a second month in a row, the bitcoin market lacks a clear directional bias, with prices largely restricted to a narrow range of $9,000 to $10,000. However, the cryptocurrency’s liquidity on derivative exchanges continues to heat up, a sign of a sustained rise in investor interest.      On a relatively new exchange like the Antigua-based FTX, the order book depth, as represented by the number of buy and sell orders at each price, now matches the depth seen on industry leader BitMEX.      One derivative seeing growth is bitcoin perpetuals, a form of futures contract, but without an expiry date and thus without a settlement. Perpetuals have a funding rate that occurs every eight hours and traders holding a position at the funding timestamp receive or pay funding.      As of Monday 13:10 UTC (9:10 a.m. ET), the daily average bid/offer spread for bitcoin perpetual swaps for $10 million quote size on FTX is 0.32% compared to 0.28% on BitMEX, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. BitMEX was founded in 2014 and is one of the largest bitcoin perpetuals exchanges by trading volumes while FTX launched in May 2018.      The bid–offer spread is the difference between the prices quoted for an immediate sale and an immediate purchase for an asset. The larger the gap, the greater the spread. A small spread implies a highly liquid market and vice versa.      See also: Bitcoin Price Drop May Be a Bear Trap, Options Market Suggests      As such, one may conclude FTX is less liquid than BitMEX. While that is true, the liquidity gap between the two has reduced substantially over the past two months. “Liquidity for bitcoin perpetual swaps on FTX has caught up with BitMEX,"" Skew tweeted Friday.      The bid/offer spread on perpetuals listed on BitMEX and FTX rose sharply after bitcoin collapsed by 40% on March 12. The spread tends to widen dramatically during a price crash when traders offload large quantities of assets within a short period of time.      The market depth was decimated following the March 12 bitcoin price crash of 40%. However, even then, BitMEX was reporting a lower spread than other exchanges.      FTX consistently reported a higher spread before the March crash and for nearly 2.5 months following the price slide. Notably, FTX registered a spread of 2.75% on May 11, when the cryptocurrency underwent its third mining reward halving. On that day, the spread on BitMEX was 0.63%.      The situation, however, changed earlier this month, with the spread on FTX converging with that on BitMEX.      ""Over time we've seen increasing volume and a growing user base on FTX as more of the crypto ecosystem onboards,"" an FTX spokesperson told CoinDesk, adding, ""We've particularly put an emphasis on growing the liquidity base over the past six months, and this quarter it's started paying off.""      Trading volumes on FTX surged from $44 million on Jan. 1 to $2.4 billion on March 13. However, volumes have since tapered off to levels seen in January this quarter, although the decline is not just limited to FTX and is seen across major exchanges.      However, FTX and Binance have suffered more than 80% decline in daily trading volume over the past three months, while BitMEX has seen nearly 40% decline, according to Skew data. That explains why BitMEX is still more liquid than FTX.    Not just FTX    Binance’s order book depth, too, has improved over the past three months. At press time, the daily average bid/offer spread on Binance for a $10 million quote is 0.29% - nearly indistinguishable from the 0.28% seen on BitMEX.      Also, Binance’s spread narrowed to BitMEX levels in April, that is, nearly two months before FTX registered a similar decline.      See also: Bitcoin SV President Hits Out at Binance as Former Critic Becomes Top Miner      Meanwhile, derivative exchanges Deribit and bitFlyer are still relatively less liquid, with bid/offer spreads at 3.12% and 4.86%, respectively. One possible explanation for the relatively low liquidity on these platforms could be the fact that they account for negligible amount of global futures/perpetuals volume. Notably, Deribit, which is the largest options exchange by volume, contributed just 1.3% of total volume traded on Sunday, as per data source Skew.      Looking forward, both Deribit and bitFlyer and other exchanges are likely to see higher liquidity because institutional participation is expected to increase over the long run. The coronavirus crisis has established bitcoin as a macro asset, according to Messari analysts.

42404763,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkWMC,1592845185,"PayPal, Venmo to Roll Out Crypto Buying and Selling: Sources","Fintech giant PayPal plans to roll out direct sales of cryptocurrency to its 325 million users, according to three people familiar with the matter.      Currently, PayPal can be used as an alternative means for withdrawing funds from exchanges such as Coinbase, but this would be a first in terms of offering direct sales of crypto.      “My understanding is that they are going to allow buys and sells of crypto directly from PayPal and Venmo,” a well-placed industry source told CoinDesk. “They are going to have some sort of a built-in wallet functionality so you can store it there.”      It is unclear which or how many cryptocurrencies would be available. The industry source said they expected PayPal “would be working with multiple exchanges to source liquidity.”      A second source confirmed that PayPal is looking to offer buying and selling of crypto and said the service could be expected “in the next three months, maybe sooner.”      PayPal declined to comment on the plans.      San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase and Luxembourg-based Bitstamp were mentioned as likely contenders by the sources. Both Coinbase and Bitstamp declined to comment.      It’s worth noting that PayPal has a longstanding relationship with Coinbase, going back as early as 2016. In 2018, Coinbase made instant fiat withdrawals to PayPal available for U.S. customers. Last year, European Coinbase users could withdraw to their PayPal accounts, followed by users in Canada.      Meanwhile, fintech apps that offer crypto are making money. Square, the payments unicorn launched by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, rolled out bitcoin purchases in its Cash App in mid-2018. Cash App reported $306 million in bitcoin revenue in its most recent earnings report.      London-based Revolut, which began offering crypto to users following a 2017 partnership with Bitstamp, raised $500 million in February, valuing the platform at $5.5 billion. Robinhood, the fintech app thought to be fueling the recent retail boom in equities day trading, first offered crypto in February 2018.      Crypto is increasingly seen as an obvious way to bolster user numbers on fintech apps and create new revenue streams. Indeed, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has made it clear his plan this year is to aggressively monetize Venmo, which has over 52 million accounts.    Hiring push    Around the start of 2020, PayPal posted job openings to ramp up its new Blockchain Research Group. PayPal posted eight engineering positions: four in San Jose and four in Singapore.      Following PayPal’s short-lived dalliance with the Facebook-led Libra project last year, the focus now is expanding its own payments expertise, one of the sources added.      In an interview with CoinDesk earlier this year, PayPal Chief Technology Officer Sri Shivananda said the company wanted its own “perspective and view on [blockchain] technology itself to see how it can help us contribute to the concept of creating an open digital payments platform that can serve everyone.”      Shivananda said he was unable to comment on any of PayPal’s specific plans.      “We are a strong believer in the potential of blockchain.

Despite Bitcoin's ability to disintermediate money from politics, a new quantum computer may eventually crack its code. Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    A Quiet Revolution Alexandra Elbakyan, the founder of Sci-Hub, a database of over 80 million articles from academic journals usually locked behind subscription services, is fomenting a quiet rebellion against copyright funded by bitcoin. The website has been sued by two science publishing houses and reportedly investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice, effectively cutting Elbakyan off the mainstream financial services in the West. Elsewhere, Honeywell unveiled the most powerful quantum computer to date, again opening questions over Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies’ security models. “According to a June 2017 paper, a quantum computer would need to have around 2,500 qubits of processing power in order to break the 256-bit encryption used by Bitcoin,” Decrypt’s Liam Frost reports.      Confusion at the Top Zhan Ketuan, the once-ousted Bitmain co-founder who returned to power this month, offered to buy back shares held by his rival co-founder Wu Jihan in an attempt to end the firm’s internal war. Zhan’s offer values the company at $4 billion, significantly down from a market high. Meanwhile, after significant push and pull, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton may be the next U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Clayton was nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump to replace Geoffrey Berman, who initially refused to step down. Finally, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) told crypto businesses they must submit their completed anti-money laundering applications by June 30, although the hard deadline for applications is Jan. 10, 2021.      Crime and Punishment New Zealand police have seized NZ$140 million (US$90 million) in bank funds linked to Alexander Vinnik, a Russian alleged to have been the controller of the now-defunct BTC-e cryptocurrency exchange. The seizure is said to be the largest in the country’s history by federal police. Meanwhile, a wallet allegedly linked to PlusToken, which has been accused of being a $3 billion Ponzi scheme, has withdrawn 26 million EOS tokens (more than $67 million). (Decrypt)      Pilots, Tests & White Papers The National Bank of Cambodia has revealed new details about its upcoming blockchain-based payments system dubbed ""Project Bakong."" The quasi-digital currency project is a revamp of the Khmer Riel secured by a Hyperledger Iroha blockchain. Meanwhile, a solar energy trading trial, partly funded by the Australia government, run by blockchain startup Power Ledger found the initiative to be “technically feasible” for real world use. Finally, the Italian Banking Association (ABI) said its 700 banking institutions are willing to pilot a digital euro.      Crypto for Social Good Racial diversity and financial inclusion are good for cryptocurrency and blockchain – and the industry has work to do. At a virtual Juneteenth event put together by the founder of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, panelists said crypto has the potential to allow citizens to opt out of what they described as a racist financial system, though people of color must be part of the development of the technology. Independently, Ron Kim, a member of the New York State Assembly, has become a fierce advocate for progressive politics as well as a surprising voice for crypto advocacy. Kim has put forward bills to create local cryptocurrencies and a decentralized standard for contact tracing in a bid to give his constituents self-sovereignty.      Funding & Finance Crypto trading platform CrossTower has raised $6 million in a seed funding round led by European tech investor Gerard Lopez. The platform supports highly active order books and tight spreads for crypto-to-crypto trading. Elsewhere, OMG Network's parent company SYNQA has raised a $80 million Series C fund led by SCB10X, the venture arm of Thailand's Siam Commercial Bank, and Mirai Creation Fund II of Japanese asset manager SPARX Group, and including participation from Toyota Financial Services Corporation, among others. (The Block) Finally, a record $1 billion of Bitcoin and Ethereum options will expire on the Deribit exchange on June 26. (The Block)    Market intel    Bitcoin & Gold Bitcoin is reporting moderate gains on Monday as gold, a safe haven asset, rallies amid renewed coronavirus concerns. The cryptocurrency is priced around $9,430 – up 1.5% on the day – having put in lows near $9,260 during the Asian hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Gold, however, printed a one-month high of $1,759 per ounce early on Monday and was last seen trading near $1,750.      Looking Through the Water XRP, the fourth-biggest digital asset by market value, has been left out of 2020’s crypto rally, marking the second straight year of underperformance. The token is down 2% in 2020, while bitcoin is up 30% and ether has gained 76%. Analysts told CoinDesk’s First Mover XRP is likely underperforming because of regulatory pressure, slow growth as a payments solution and a lack of classic proof-of-work mining that generates fresh supply for the trading market. Such negatives have outweighed bullish factors like a reduced pace of sales by the XRP software developer Ripple and signs of progress in a partnership with the payments transmitter MoneyGram (NASDAQ: MGI).    Opinion    Start With Gold Gunnar Jaerv, COO of First Digital Trust, said the tokenization revolution, which could reach more than $544 trillion worth of assets, will be kicked off by tokenizing precious metals by paving the way for regulatory clarity and proving the effectiveness. “Gold has long been a trusted store of value for investors, especially when fiat currencies experience volatility. By tokenizing assets like gold on the blockchain, you are guaranteed the digital rights to your investment,” Jaerv said.    Crypto Long & Short    What Changed My Mind About Bitcoin Narratives CoinDesk’s Head of Research Noelle Acheson thinks one of crypto’s virtues is its level of debate. Last week, Bloomberg editor Joe Weisenthal and several JPMorgan analysts gave differing views of Bitcoin’s value and performance throughout 2020. Both are centered around the idea that Bitcoin has a central narrative it either hits or misses. “I have always regarded bitcoin’s lack of a clear narrative as a strength. I was wrong – it is both a strength and a weakness,” Acheson writes. “Bitcoin’s main use case is yet to be determined… [and] the demand growth from any one of its many narratives could be enough to push up its value.”    Who won #CryptoTwitter?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/22/blockchain-bites-bitmains-4b-valuation-cambodias-cbdc-and-btc-es-bust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c8f1fd470c2372b4fb17106190667e5aeeabb7c-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404760,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkWIG,1592841369,The Big Thing Holding Back India's Crypto Boom,"Until recently, India’s crypto industry had much reason for optimism. In March, the country’s Supreme Court overturned a ban on banks working with exchanges, clearing a major hurdle. Then the coronavirus pandemic seemed to improve the business case for digital currency, with several exchanges reporting steep growth in users.      Now, uncertainty is back. The government may be about to ban crypto altogether, according to media reports, and India’s central bank has been unhelpfully unclear about its guidelines for commercial banks. There are dozens of unanswered questions, and startups are back to asking, ''What's next?''      The uncertainty is hard for crypto businesses such as the Sequoia-backed crypto exchange CoinSwitch. It launched an app on June 1 called CoinSwitch Kuber, and has signed up more than 100,000 users so far, CEO Ashish Singhal says. It is so simple to use, he says, that his 65-year-old mother is able to buy and sell bitcoin and check her portfolio.      See also: India’s Rumored Crypto Ban May Be Overblown, Say Industry Pros      Despite this, when trying to open a business account, he received a rejection from a private bank. ''We were in touch with the bank for many weeks and prepared the required documents, but it ended up with a 'no,''' he says.      The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) says there is no banking ban in place. It was forced to clarify the matter in response to a right-to-information request filed by Harish B.V., co-founder of the Unocoin exchange, on April 25. But Indian commercial banks are still waiting for further instructions from the central bank. A senior banker interviewed by The Economic Times said, ‘‘We will be guided by RBI’s directions on the matter and once we get clarity we will act appropriately. As banks, some of the concerns we had on cryptocurrencies were around security, use of money and traceability.”      Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX, an exchange acquired last year by Binance, blames a RBI edict issued in April 2018 that barred banks from facilitating any service in relation to virtual currencies. This communicated to the masses that crypto is a fraud, he says. He claims the trading volume of WazirX went up by 400% after the recent Supreme Court ruling, and that it could have been even better with clear guidelines from the RBI.    The Indian government has a history of banning what it doesn't understand.    ''Due to the lack of [banking] regulations, we aren't able to make most of it in the booming time of crypto,” he says.      To spread crypto awareness in India, Shetty began a Twitter campaign named #IndiaWantsCrypto. He starts his day composing a Tweet on crypto each morning. A similar awareness program called DCX Learn has been launched by CoinDCX, another leading crypto exchange. It had 10 times its normal number of user sign-ups in the Q1 of 2020, leading CEO Sumit Gupta to start an online educational platform dedicated to blockchain and cryptocurrencies on June 16.      Indian crypto has seen strong volume from women traders and youngsters from tier-2 or -3 cities. Singhal claims that as per the current data, 52% of the trades are made by women on CoinSwitch, and the youngsters from small towns are curious to know about alternates to the stock market and mutual funds.      Shetty says many women support his #indiawantscrypto campaign and ask questions about his startup. That was not the case three or four months ago. For example, social media influencer Akanksha Redhu has supported the campaign and helped escalate it in the conversation. The number of users from small towns has increased 155.5% in the past three months, he adds.      India leads in other areas of software and IT development but it lacks leadership in blockchain and cryptos. Crypto pros fear the lack of regulations would lead to scams and fraud, and they might have to face a blanket ban ultimately, which would be a big jolt to new companies.      The trade body Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI), which represented the crypto industry before the Supreme Court, wants to be heard by RBI and the government and make the policy collaboratively. Shetty wants the central government to act more like the Telangana State government, which is fostering blockchain companies. ''In the last two years, only $3 to $5 million have been invested in the Indian crypto industry. If we are late movers, our country will lose innovation and won't succeed,'' Shetty says.      Sat Prakash Sharma, chief economist at the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says that for youngsters, crypto is a way to ''multiply money infinite times,'' and is not something meant for the wider Indian population.      See also: Tanvi Ratna - The Dangerous Truth About India’s Cryptocurrency Verdict      Pankaj Jain, a New York-based Indian crypto investor, says officials show a lack of awareness about the potential of digital assets and blockchain tech. ‘‘The Indian government has a history of banning what it doesn't understand,’’ he says. ‘‘Gas the building to kill a fly.’’      Singhal says the large unbanked population lives in India, and that is where the democratic setup of cryptos could bring people to the exchange. He gives an example of demonetization in 2016 (when Indians were asked to hand in 500- and 1,000-rupee notes), which encouraged Indians to use services like Paytm or Google Pay. Now many people hardly carry cash to pay bills or to buy movie tickets.

Headquartered in Beijing, the company operates Antpool and BTC.com, which have historically been two of the largest bitcoin mining pools by computing power.  Bitmain also runs multiple mining farms, including in Canada and multiple locations in China and the United States. Additionally, Bitmain has attempted to establish a presence in the artificial intelligence industry and produces deep-learning chips among other products. Likewise, the company has invested in numerous crypto startups including derivatives market provider ErisX, crypto financier Global Digital Mercantile Ltd., crypto financial services startup Circle, and EOS creator Block.one.  In 2018, Bitmain considered becoming a publicly traded company, and filed an application to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX). However HKEX was reportedly hesitant to approve the application due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. The company allowed the application to lapse six months after filing, but indicated that it may attempt to go public yet again in the future.

42404752,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkWAO,1592840345,Fed Economists Call Fears of Original Libra Stablecoin ‘Overstated’,"Economists at the Federal Reserve said an earlier version of Libra, the Facebook-linked stablecoin frequently targeted by lawmakers and central bankers as an economic wrecking ball, was unlikely to have lived up to its sovereign currency-killer hype.      Calling “fears of a so-called global stablecoin” “overstated” in a new report published Monday, economists Garth Baughman and Jean Flemming say policymakers may have focused perhaps too acutely on the likely downside of the previous Libra iteration's multiple currencies backing a new stablecoin. The pair modeled a so-called basket-backed stablecoin in a hypothetical scenario, evaluating the likely impact that stablecoin would have on the economy as well as the likelihood of it being adopted.      Critics argued Libra’s original plan to maintain its stablecoin’s value from multiple currency reserves could destabilize or even displace those underlying fiat currencies. U.S lawmakers tried to freeze the project, Australia’s central bank said no one would use it and France’s finance minister threatened to block Libra over fears it could oust sovereign currencies.      The Fed economists wrote that their own modeling discounts that possibility.      “Our model shows that although the basket may have the potential to become important and globally demanded, [the regular ebb and flow of fiat value and trade] make it such that the basket never dominates either of the component currencies,” they wrote.      See also: Libra Is Ready for the Digital Money ‘Space Race’: Dante Disparte      Their point is in some ways moot. Libra’s project leaders abandoned plans for a single basket-backed stablecoin in April 2020 in a major concession to regulators. Now, Libra’s “global stablecoin” will be a basket of other stablecoins themselves backed by fiat reserves.      But the Fed's paper, written in February and apparently updated a month after Libra’s change, nonetheless raises questions about whether policymakers moved too aggressively against the tech project they blasted for months.      “A simpler question arises: Does a basket currency actually provide substantial value relative to the current system?"" they asked. They found that may well be the case in certain circumstances.      “Although the basket currency will never dominate the sovereign currencies it comprises, we find that there can be substantial gains in world welfare if many sellers accept the basket as payment,” they wrote.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/22/fed-economists-call-fears-of-original-libra-stablecoin-overstated,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e08dab5ed66a43d52bca8357bbff61420a4dbb96-1500x693.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The funding is for Opyn, which offers crypto-based derivatives, beginning with the oToken, which is a permissionless hedging instrument. The company reports $36 million in trading volume since launch. Others in the funding round include angel investors Balaji Srinivasan, formerly of Coinbase; Robert Leshner, founder of Compound; and Linda Xie, also a Coinbase alum who co-founded Scalar Capital.      Crypto getting down with the risk management business sounds like the death knell of the punk-rock era of the industry. On the other hand, as projects like Opyn become more robust they will create ways for thesis-driven investors to make money via contrarian positions, and that could be very punk rock.      With the surge in demand for the COMP token, many users may have funds that would normally be in cash rather than crypto right now, which could feel risky for users. The ability to insure their USDC deposits on Compound might now be unusually attractive.      Read more: Options Protocol Brings ‘Insurance’ to DeFi Deposits on Compound      Opyn offers oTokens, which are basically insurance policies, but without insurance adjusters. So here's how a user would insure their USDC using the product. An oToken would allow them, for a small fee, to recover most of the investment's value if they turned in the underlying token.      So a user could insure $100 in USDC for $95. The user could unlock the $95 in collateral on their oUSDC token but they would have to turn in 100 USDC to do it. They can do this at any time without any kind of check or verification.

In the last couple of years, traditional financial institutions and regulators have started to embrace digital assets. Asset tokenization – declaring ownership rights to an asset in digital form – is opening new market opportunities, channels of investments and consequently, new streams of capital for global businesses and markets.      Some estimates show more than $544 trillion worth of assets could become tokenized in the future, and nations with progressive regulators will be the first to access its potential. There’s been a recent uptick of financial regulators and institutions developing digital asset adoption infrastructure further indicating the advancement of this new way of managing funds. In May 2020, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) declared customers can now legally carry out digital asset transactions, for example.      See also: Olga Feldmeier - Looking for a Safe Haven Digital Asset? Try Gold    French banking giant Societe Generale is testing tokenized bonds that are settled in digital euros by the central bank of France. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Inland Revenue Department has begun providing guidancehttps://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/04/tnf-hong-kong-taxation-of-digital-assets.html for taxpayers on how to correctly invest in these new forms of digital assets.    Institutional adoption of tokenized assets in 2020 is inevitable, but, like other newly introduced assets, they need clear taxation processes, security protocols and regulatory frameworks across the board for investors to make the most of them legally, and safely.    Tokenization of assets is starting    From precious metals to real estate and art, tokenization is revolutionizing a wide range of industries.      One of the most popular forms of tokenization is precious metals, in particular gold. Gold has long been a trusted store of value for investors, especially when fiat currencies experience volatility. By tokenizing assets like gold on the blockchain, you are guaranteed the digital rights to your investment.      Tokenized gold has a myriad of benefits when it exists on the blockchain. Firstly, when investors buy in, they are purchasing the rights to real physical gold stored in secure vaults. This eliminates issues of storage and transport and eradicates unnecessary bureaucracy and untrusted third parties, as the asset is immutable and instantly accessible on a distributed ledger.      It can be traded, collateralized or static, and can be cheaper, too. Traditional gold purchases have added premiums up to 30% when sold through retailers. When you buy tokenized gold, you’re able to access it closest to its spot market price. And if you were looking to break up a traditional gold bar, it immediately drops in value and you can no longer sell it in bulk to certain institutions.      In the real estate industry, you can now enjoy the luxury of investing in property by purchasing fractional ownership, which dramatically opens up opportunities for wealth. In 2018, Hong Kong was the most expensive city for property, with the average price for a home costing $1.24 million. For the majority of the population, entering the house market is a near impossible task. Digitized real estate is not a radical idea either as it already exists in the form of digital titles in various countries around the world.    When you buy tokenized gold, you’re able to access it closest to its spot market price.    Some countries are still using outdated forms of record-keeping via paper, but many are already keeping digital records. The next step is adding this asset to the blockchain and drafting smart contracts that declare the rights.      Having real estate titles on a decentralized ledger can boost investor confidence and foreign direct investment too. Some countries are plagued with inefficient record-keeping and corruption concerns. With a title registry on the blockchain, these transactions are transparent and secure, enabling investors to rest assured record titles are honored by government bodies.      In sport, we see Spencer Dinwiddie, a famous U.S. pro basketball player, becoming the first athlete to tokenize his own contract and introduce a new asset class to a fanbase of more than two billion. In the art world, we see enthusiasts purchasing digital tokens to own a portion of rare anime artwork.      There are a few things to consider when deciding to invest in tokenized assets. It’s simply not enough just to purchase a token – you need to understand the tax requirements of your investment and the regulations of your own jurisdiction.      Digital tokens often fall under strict regulations that can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Therefore, you should only trade on exchanges that are compliant. If jurisdictions prevent the free and international exchange of tokens, then your opportunities will be limited. Luckily, international regulatory alignment is increasing.    Hong Kong    Some regions of the world have environments of free token trade, allowing the industry to flourish. Hong Kong, where First Digital Trust is located, has a unique position. The growth of Ethereum has led to many private and public companies moving to the city to make the most of its position in business, technology and law.      On top of that, assets such as gold are taxable in the hands of individuals or corporations in most places around the world. But in Hong Kong, gold tokens can be designed so U.S. taxes can be deferred. This has made Hong Kong an ideal location for tokenized trade.      See also: Frances Coppola - The Tokenization Delusion      The Basic Law of Hong Kong enshrines multiple free market principles that have always made it an enticing financial hub and place of trade. Despite COVID-19 causing economic challenges, and the recent turn of events, Hong Kong’s free market principles have not been affected. The financial center has remained resilient and global trade continues to flow throughout the city.      In 2019, the “Statement on Security Token Offerings” was announced, highlighting a strong interest in the new asset class of virtual assets, acknowledging the advantages of cryptocurrencies, crypto-assets and digital tokens.      The benefits for institutional investors are undeniable, but what’s holding them back is a lack of clarity. Digital assets are not just shiny cryptocurrencies. They are securities and commodities in various forms. Investors aren’t clear on what can be tokenized, and they are not confident in the regulations and processes surrounding them.      For this industry to thrive, we need greater involvement from key players. We need more than token issuers running the project. We need taxation, accounting, ownership titles, custodians, legal teams, auditors and regulators. We need a global collaborative effort and the regulatory infrastructure to optimize on these opportunities.    Real-world custodial solutions    With new asset opportunities, there also comes new risks. For example, if a token issuer is also holding onto the underlying assets, what’s stopping them from selling it or borrowing against it? How do you protect the claim to the underlying asset and be protected by law?      As with any new digital asset advancement, the correct technology and infrastructure must be able to protect it. This is where custody services are critical, and why they are on the rise. Qualified independent custodians and trustees hold the title and safekeep the real-world asset that is backing the digital token.      Furthermore, digital assets can be fraught with risk if they are not settled correctly. Custodians eliminate the risk of counterparties failing to fulfill a transaction, and investors are better protected when using regulated custodians. The solutions for digital asset security must be as robust as traditional asset security.      Tokenized assets are the future, and regional regulators, custody providers and investors all have a part to play. There is immense potential in opening the doors to tokenizing assets, but a global standard is required. Legislative and regulatory frameworks differ from one jurisdiction to the next, limiting the spread of adoption.      Without supportive regulatory measures, increased engagement from relevant parties and stronger levels of protection, the whole industry is at risk. A lack of scrutiny and protection could shatter the entire token economy, scaring off investors from digital asset potential. But if we do it right, the opportunities are endless.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Gunnar Jaerv,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/22/the-tokenization-revolution-starts-with-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed9f518b2a810b5e35d1875c4b7ee9330a83b2ff-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404749,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkTug,1592830296,First Mover: XRP Just Isn’t Exciting Crypto Traders This Year,"XRP, the fourth-biggest digital asset by market value, has been left out of 2020's rally in cryptocurrencies, marking the second straight year of underperformance compared with its larger and more popular rivals, bitcoin and ether.      The token is down 2% in 2020, while bitcoin is up 30% and ether, the native token from the Ethereum blockchain, has gained 76%.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Cryptocurrency analysts and investors say XRP is likely underperforming this year because of regulatory pressure, slow growth as a payments solution and a lack of classic proof-of-work mining that generates fresh supply for the trading market. Such negatives have outweighed bullish factors that include a reduced pace of sales by the XRP software developer Ripple and signs of progress in a partnership with the payments transmitter MoneyGram (NASDAQ: MGI).      “Even throughout this most recent bull crypto market run, there has rarely ever been anyone discussing XRP,” said Jack Tan, managing partner at Taiwan-based trading firm Kronos Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      XRP’s lagging returns follow an abysmal 2019, when the price fell 45% while bitcoin more than doubled. The token’s share of the overall digital-asset market capitalization has tumbled to 3%, from 12% early last year, according to metrics compiled by TradingView.      Mike Novogratz, whose firm Galaxy Digital owns a $29 million stake in XRP software developer Ripple, according to a Q1 2020 filing, said in January at a conference he thought XRP would “underperform immensely again” this year. He wasn’t wrong.      “We can’t control, nor do we focus on, the price of XRP day to day,” a Ripple spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email. “What Ripple is thinking about is the utility of XRP, and building solutions that solve real problems with global payments.”      XRP has been one of the crypto industry’s most popular assets since 2012. That year, as an alternative to bitcoin, the founders of what would become San Francisco-based Ripple gifted the company 80 billion XRP out of a total 100 billion created.      The leading software company working on XRP, Ripple is a startup with over 530 employees, according to LinkedIn, and has raised over $286 million in venture capital from firms including Galaxy. Major product offerings from the company include RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), which are used to facilitate fast and cheap payments.       XRP is notable for an often vocal and devoted community of backers, who sometimes refer to themselves as the XRP Army and support both the cryptocurrency and Ripple. There are also investment firms backing the cryptocurrency.       “XRP is a perfect currency for what we do,” Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch who now runs Arrington XRP Capital, one of the largest XRP investment funds, said in a phone interview.       XRP’s properties of being fast and cheap – Arrington said he’s been able to move millions of dollars in the digital asset for as little as $0.45 – is one major reason why the fund likes its future potential.      “Right now we think XRP is dramatically undervalued,” he said. “All else being equal, we're buyers at these prices. Maybe not leverage buyers, but we think it's undervalued.”      Just last week, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Chris Giancarlo said XRP deserved to be considered a cryptocurrency, not a security. Giancarlo is now a senior partner at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, where Ripple is a client.      The question of whether XRP might be declared a security has haunted the asset because a declaration to that effect by the Securities and Exchange Commission would likely subject the token and its ecosystem to stricter regulations and potentially enforcement actions. Multiple lawsuits, one filed as recently as May, allege XRP should be a security.      XRP’s price didn’t really budge in response to Giancarlo’s comments, possibly an indication traders are still waiting to hear from the SEC on the matter.      Another overhang is sales of tokens into the market: Ripple Labs does sell XRP to raise cash, although according to a first-quarter market report published by the company its sales of the tokens dropped to $1.75 million during the first three months of the year, down 86% from fourth-quarter levels.      One of the biggest users of XRP is the payments transmitter MoneyGram, which received a $50 million equity investment from Ripple Labs last year. Upon completion of the investment in November, MoneyGram announced 10% of the company’s Mexican peso foreign exchange liquidity was already using Ripple’s ODL product to move money.      In February, Ripple Labs executive Ashseeh Birla provided an update on MoneyGram’s progress using its technology:      In the first quarter of 2020, MoneyGram reported it was able to reduce its operating expenses with a $12.1 million “benefit” derived from “Ripple market development fees.” However, there’s no further information about the growth of ODL within the company’s business lines other than that the partnership, valid through July 2023, is expected to continue to reduce expenses.      Ripple Labs has formed relationships with hundreds of partners, including Bank of America, which has reportedly piloted some of its technology.      But banks might be worried about holding the tokens for fear of having to report any gains or losses to shareholders or supervisors, Haohan Xu, CEO of cryptocurrency liquidity provider Apifiny, wrote in an email message.      “This is especially given the different regulations across the globe, and being exposed to the volatility risk when holding XRP,” Xu said.      So can demand for XRP be driven by usage or expected usage of its network for payments? How will XRP’s regulatory issues conclude? Does selling pressure from a lack of proof-of-work mining create some concern among traders?      ""XRP is an interesting crypto asset because whilst the fundamentals seem to indicate growth and greater adoption, the price action is showing the opposite,” Simon Peters, a cryptocurrency analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,432 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,441 | 24-Hr Low: $9,273      Trend: While bitcoin is flashing green at press time, it is still trading within the narrow range of $9,000–$10,000 it's been largely stuck in for over a month.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands near $9,440, representing a 1.5% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Prices are rangebound for the 11th straight day amid mixed signals on the technical charts. On the bullish side, the three-day 50- and 100-candle moving averages (MA) have produced a bullish crossover. A similar cross accelerated the uptrend in June 2019 and marked the beginning of a multi-year bull run in October 2015.      However, the three-day MACD histogram, an MA-based indicator used to identify trend strength and trend changes, has crossed below zero for the first time since early April, confirming a bearish reversal. The daily chart, too, is reporting conflicting signals with the MACD hovering below zero and the 50- and 200-day SMAs, signaling a bull market.      With indicators lacking consensus on the potential direction of the next range breakout, traders will be waiting for a strong directional cue to emerge.      A UTC close above $10,000 would restore the bull run from the March low of $3,867 and open the doors for a $1,000 rally. On the way higher, the February high of $10,500 could offer resistance.      Alternatively, a move below $9,000 will likely yield a sell-off to the 200-day SMA at $8,267.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | XRP,"Daniel Cawrey, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/22/first-mover-xrp-just-isnt-exciting-crypto-traders-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d624c68b06c09d92786e4c0675800acb13e4018-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CrossTower said its platform supports highly active order books and tight spreads for crypto-to-crypto trading. Launched last month, users can trade nine of the most frequently traded cryptocurrencies on the crypto exchange operator’s platform, including bitcoin, ether, XRP and Zcash.      The firm’s co-founder and president, Kristin Boggiano, said CrossTower was launched at a time of change in the financial markets.      “Jurisdictions and governments around the world are increasingly embracing crypto finance to avail more efficient payment, trading and investment services,” she said.      She added that while the firm is not chasing a specific volume of users, its mission is to make investing in digital assets more mainstream.      “While CrossTower aims at a wide market, the institutional-ready approach is one of the founders’ most appealing and distinguishing strengths,” said Gerard Lopez, speaking about what attracted him towards making an investment in CrossTower’s platform.      CrossTower co-founder and CEO Kapil Rathi said what distinguishes the firm’s trading platform from all the others on the market was its “get paid to trade” pricing model. According to Rathi, the model upsets the status quo by offering rebates to takers and charging a nominal fee to market makers.      “This fee structure is designed to draw traders to the system as we will pay takers of liquidity 1 bps of the value of each trade,” Rathi said.

42404750,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkTth,1592827705,Bitcoin Sees Small Gain as Gold Rallies to One-Month High,"Bitcoin is reporting moderate gains on Monday as gold, a safe haven asset, rallies amid renewed coronavirus concerns.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is priced around $9,430 – up 1.5% on the day – having put in lows near $9,260 during the Asian hours, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Gold, however, printed a one-month high of $1,759 per ounce early on Monday and was last seen trading near $1,750.      The precious metal looks to be rising as the markets return their focus to the coronavirus pandemic, with the number of new cases rising at a faster pace in Germany, the U.S. and other parts of the world over the past few days. Investors seem worried the major economies may reimpose lockdowns to avoid a second wave of the outbreak, which could worsen an already deep economic crisis.      Some companies like tech giant Apple have already announced temporary store closures in four U.S. states following a jump in COVID-19 cases last week.      Authorities in Australia have extended a state of emergency for four more weeks to July 19. Meanwhile, the uptick in the German infection rate caused by an outbreak among abattoir employees has sparked debate about working conditions in its meat processing industry, as noted by popular macro analyst Holger Zschaepitz.      Hence, it's perhaps not surprising safe haven assets like gold are drawing bids. A recent study by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis shows the majority of bitcoin is held by those who treat it as ""digital gold,"" or an asset to be held for the long term.      Bitcoin’s uptick seen so far on Monday may bring cheer to those who believe in the safe haven narrative. However, a closer look at the markets suggests the cryptocurrency is tracking S&P 500 futures.      U.S. stock futures, which were down by nearly 1% during the early Asian trading hours, are now reporting a 1% gain.      Further, while gold has gained over 5% in the last two weeks, bitcoin has largely been restricted to a narrow range of $9,000 to $10,000 since the May 11 halving.    Futures fatigue?    As the top cryptocurrency's rally from the March 13 low of $3,867 looks to have stalled near $10,000, institutional investors are showing temporary exhaustion, according to one analyst.      ""On the CME futures, we are seeing some signs that the bulls might be getting tired waiting for a breakout above $10,000. The average daily traded volume is trending down which is not surprising since it follows price volatility. But at the same time open interest is also trending down,"" noted Ecoinometrics, a bitcoin analysis company.      As of Friday, futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which is widely considered to be synonymous with institutional activity, registered trading volume of $195 million, down nearly 80% from the high of $914 million observed on May 11, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      In addition, open interest – the number of contracts traded but not squared off by taking offsetting positions – was $394 million Friday, down 26% from the high of $532 million seen on May 19.      While futures activity is slowing down, CME options are reporting record open interest.      Option contracts worth $417 million were open on the CME on Friday, representing a staggering 3,000% rise from the tally of $13 million observed on May 1.      As such, one may argue that institutional interest in bitcoin hasn’t died down but merely shifted instruments.      It remains to be seen if the record open interest on options is rolled over to July expiry contracts following the expiry of June contracts this Friday.      As of this writing, there are 114,000 contracts set for expiry on June 26, according to Skew. If that open interest is not rolled over to July/September, it would confirm what futures activity is suggesting.      “The last two month-end/month-open (end of April/start of May and start of June) both saw large upside moves as stale positions were rolled off and new positions were put on,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital noted on its Telegram channel. ""We are questioning whether this can be 3 in a row after such a large open interest, comprising mostly upside calls rolls off, or has the short-term institutional bullishness mostly died down.”      Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/22/bitcoin-sees-small-gain-as-gold-rallies-to-one-month-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/217b85249d152dc501e3ab7682ea577ff2181f8e-1200x743.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""The 30 June date allows the FCA to review submitted applications and raise any follow-up questions with firms, with enough time for that process to be completed before 10 January 2021,"" the FCA said.

The seizure of funds, which were controlled by a New Zealand-registered company, is said to be the largest in the country's history by federal police. The force's Asset Recovery Unit moved to freeze the funds amid a global investigation into the activities of the exchange and its operators, according to a report by news source NZ Herald.      U.S. prosecutors have alleged that Vinnik controlled BTC-e, a bitcoin exchange used to launder billions of dollars for criminal enterprises. Vinnik, who has been denying the charges for up to three years, was arrested based on extradition orders from the U.S. while on holiday with family in Greece in 2017.

42404734,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkTfv,1592817929,Bitmain Co-Founder Offers Share Buyback at $4B Valuation to End Power Struggle,"Zhan Ketuan, the once-ousted Bitmain co-founder who returned to power earlier this month, is proposing a solution to end the firm's internal war.      In a letter Sunday, Zhan, who as Bitmain's biggest shareholder owns 36% of its stock, offered to buy back shares possessed by rival co-founder Wu Jihan, several founding members and some of Bitmain employees, at a company valuation of $4 billion.      Wu controls about 20% of Bitmain and three other founding members own about 15% in total. Bitmain's employee stock option pool has another 19% and the remaining 10% belongs to external investors.      Read more: How Was It Possible for Bitmain to Oust Its Largest Shareholder Overnight?      But Zhan's $4 billion valuation of the firm is significantly down from a market high seen in the summer 2018. Bitmain had been valued at around $1 billion in September 2017 during its Series A round. When it went into high-profile fundraising in August 2018, it was valued at $12 billion and eventually $14.5 billion in a pre-IPO round.      The offer comes in an effort to bring about negotiations that could end the divisions that have been tearing the company apart since Zhan clawed his way back into the firm after being ousted by Wu last October.    Chip threat    In addition to causing division among employees, the power struggle is endangering the firm's miner manufacturing processes.      Zhan's letter had been in response to a Sunday statement on Beijing Bitmain's official website, which is controlled by Wu, saying its Hong Kong parent entity had cut off the chip processor supply chain to its Shenzhen factory.      ""Bitmain Hong Kong has suspended the chip supply for the time being to Century Cloud Core, which is now controlled by Zhan's relatives, until we are assured, through negotiation with Zhan's relatives, that they are committed to protecting the interest of Bitmain's customers and of the company as a whole,"" the statement reads.      Bitmain Technologies Limited in Hong Kong is Bitmain's offshore sales and procurement center for crypto mining hardware. The bitcoin miner's manufacturing business relies on computing chips supplied by semiconductor companies.      Since Zhan's forceful return to the firm, he had seized control of Century Cloud Core, Bitmain's packaging factory and warehouse in Shenzhen, and paused shipments to customers. According to a former employee at Beijing Bitmain who is familiar with the matter, Zhan's brother-in-law, Zhou Feng, has been placed in charge of the Shenzhen entity.      In his letter, Zhan responded that, if necessary, he would procure chips directly via Beijing Bitmain, even if that would cause a great deal of loss for the company as a whole.      He further accused Wu of, among other things, forging a resolution passed by a claimed ""shareholder meeting"" last November at the Bitmain's Cayman Islands-based holding entity. In fact, the meeting was never held because ""several other shareholders including Zhan Ketuan as the biggest stakeholder never received a notice of such meeting ever,"" Zhan claimed.

That, in turn, is fully owned by the ultimate controlling entity, BitMain Technologies Holding, which incorporated in the Caymans but also registered in Hong Kong.      When ousting Zhan in October last year, Wu filed to the Hong Kong government to have Zhan's name removed as a board director at the Cayman holding company.

42404748,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkTsi,1592812800,"Blackballed by PayPal, Scientific-Paper Pirate Takes Bitcoin Donations","A quiet rebellion against copyright is being waged on a single website by a freelance coder, using cryptocurrency where PayPal won’t do.      Bitcoin as a censorship-free money has been used by outlaws of all sorts, but this time the outlaw is a young scientist from Kazakhstan breaking through the paywalls of academic journals.      Alexandra Elbakyan, a 31-year-old freelance coder, neurobiologist and phylologist, is running a database of over 80 million articles from academic journals that are normally available only through subscriptions. What started out of frustration when she was a graduate student became a free research service funded only through donations. For most people in the world, bitcoin is the only way to support Elbakyan’s work.      The website, called Sci-Hub, has been sued by two science publishing houses and reportedly investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible espionage on behalf of Russian intelligence. (Elbakyan said she never got contacted by the U.S. authorities about it.) This effectively cut Elbakyan off the mainstream financial services in the West.      Elbakyan told CoinDesk the website sees about 600,000 visits each day. Even for those researchers who have access to subscriptions via universities, Sci-Hub turns out to be the most convenient option to get content for their research, she said.      But her struggles underscore one of the fundamental value propositions of cryptocurrency: When people can’t use the mainstream payment ralis, crypto offers an alternative. It’s hardly a bellwether of a broad adoption coming, but it is “a good example of bitcoin as a niche payments rail,” economist John Paul Koning told CoinDesk.      “For most purposes, people prefer to use regular fiat payments because they are easy,” said Koning, a CoinDesk columnist. “But when they get locked out, either because they are engaging in illegal activities or legal ones that are deemed socially unacceptable, bitcoin becomes an option. People who have been locked out of these conventional systems are slowly discovering that bitcoin can serve them.”      See also: Tearing Down Monuments Isn’t Censorship – It’s Speech      Elbakyan says bitcoin only constitutes a small part of all donations. Most often, it’s the online payment service Yandex.Money that is available in Russia and nearby countries including Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. However, for all the other parts of the world, crypto is the only direct way to support Sci-Hub.      Sometimes, that can be an issue. Still few people trust bitcoin, Elbakyan says, and some countries prohibit crypto, such as Bolivia and Ecuador.      “Somebody wrote to me recently saying that in his country only drug addicts use bitcoin, and asked if there were any other ways to donate,” Elbakyan said.      In 2018, University of Pennsylvania postdoctoral fellow Daniel Himmelstein and a group of other scholars found that Sci-Hub raised more than 94 bitcoin, worth about $900,000 at recent prices, before 2018. Speaking with CoinDesk, Elbakyan confirmed that the estimate was mostly fair.      The 2017 bitcoin rally was a good moment for her, Elbakyan says, as she could sell some bitcoin at a high price. But otherwise she’s nonchalant about all things blockchain and distributed tech. When asked if distributed file storage solutions currently in the works could be useful for Sci-Hub, she says the site works fine as it is.    Access denied    Elbakyan’s clash with the publishing industry cost her the ability to use any U.S.-based services. In 2015, Dutch science publishing house Elsevier, a publisher of 2,500 science journals, including The Lancet and ScienceDirect, sued Sci-Hub for copyright infringement.      In 2017, a federal court, the U.S. Southern District Court of New York, sided with Elsevier and ruled Sci-Hub should stop operating and pay $15 million in damages. In a similar lawsuit, the American Chemistry Society won a case against Elbakyan and the right to demand another $4.8 million in damages.      In addition, both courts effectively prohibited any U.S. company from facilitating Sci-Hub’s work. Elbakyan had to migrate the website from its early .org domain, and the U.S.-based online payment services are no longer an option for her. She can no longer use Cloudflare, a service that protects websites from denial-of-service attacks, she said.      “When I opened a PayPal account, the donations would hit every minute. But after one day the wallet would get frozen,” Elbakyan said. She showed CoinDesk an email from PayPal in 2013, in which the company notified Elbakyan that Elsevier reported her for copyright infringement and she should either remove the violating materials from Sci-Hub or remove PayPal as a donation option.      See also: The Decentralized Web Has Plans, if Not Solutions, for the Misinformation Nightmare      “Payment processors are increasingly taking a keen interest in what their users are doing with their services; even going as far as banning political figures who they might disapprove of,” says Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures.      “In this world of politicized payment rails, the existence of a neutral alternative that treats everyone equally is a godsend,” Carter said, referring to bitcoin.      PayPal’s press office did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.      So now researchers in the U.S. who, just like Elbakyan, can’t afford costly subscriptions to access scientific content, can only thank her by using bitcoin. And they are using Sci-Hub, data shows.      Himmelstein found that Sci-Hub has been steadily growing in popularity since its inception in 2011, going from 185,243 downloads per day in February 2016 to 458,589 in 2017. The researchers found Sci-Hub usage has exceeded that of the University of Pennsylvania online library twentyfold.    Academic lifeline    As she was speaking to CoinDesk, 30 papers were being downloaded over the course of three minutes, Elbakyan said, adding that during the busiest hours, there can be thousands of papers downloaded in the same amount of time.      “If you’re working from home, you need to access the university’s server first. And many people told me that they needed to click through multiple links and even then the paper wouldn’t open up – this is how clumsy the legal access is,” Elbakyan said.      She first got frustrated with the cost of academic knowledge as a student, working on her graduate paper, Elbakyan wrote in her autobiography on Sci-Hub. When she was a teenager she hacked websites for fun. When she was 16 she created a script allowing her to download books from the MIT CogNet website for free, despite the paywall, Elbakyan wrote.      Back then, she would rely on the network of researchers who would share papers they had access to via an online forum, she said in an interview with the website Newtonew. Then, she decided to create an automatically updating database of academic knowledge, which became Sci-Hub.      The website is using other researchers’ credentials for university proxy servers – Elbakyan won’t say how exactly she gets the credentials – and automatically downloading papers onto Sci-Hub’s server, where people can find them using a web address or unique identifier of a paper they need.    ‘Most people don’t care’    Elbakyan is maintaining the website alone, believing it’s the safest way. “If you have a team, it can fall apart at some point, or you might have a mole,” she said.      But while she doesn’t need more people working on Sci-Hub, she would love to see a widespread discussion about free access to academic knowledge, she says. A self-described Communist in her political views, Elbakyan believes the paywall policy of science publishing is a kind of censorship.      “I had a dream that Sci-Hub gets discussed by the U.N.,” Elbakyan said, referring to the United Nations. “For example, Russia could tell the U.S. that it’s a violation of human rights [to ban Sci-Hub] because the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights says everyone has the right to participate in scientific advancement. But that remained only a dream.”      See also: The New York Times Proves Why Civil’s Vision Is Still Vital      Elbakyan says she hasn’t approached any political parties or government bodies, thinking they could pick up on the censorship argument if they were interested. She does not believe most people are interested in discussing freedom of knowledge.      “There is no real community to discuss that, you hardly hear such voices. Not just in the mainstream media, but even on YouTube, for example. It all died by 2013, when Aaron Swartz died,” she said, adding that even though many people are using her website or pirate websites such as torrent trackers, few care how and why they work.      “People don’t think about the [copyright] laws, about doing something about it or voting against it,” Elbakyan says. “When people reach out to me, they usually write to say ‘thank you’ or ask how to better donate.”      Sci-Hub’s standoff with the publishing industry is a good fight, Carter (who is also a CoinDesk columnist) believes. “The law and morality don't always match up, and they certainly don't in this case,” he said, adding:    “Sci-Hub has undeniably made the world a better place, and Alexandra has had to live as a pariah because of it. Funding her operations with bitcoin perfectly demonstrates its value proposition.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/22/blackballed-by-paypal-scientific-paper-pirate-takes-bitcoin-donations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/884bb5116ac857db35eb0b499d100b230df83459-1200x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404743,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkTnn,1592809200,Securitize's Japan Subsidiary Becomes First International Firm to Join Self-Regulatory Group,"Securitize Japan, a subsidiary of U.S.-based Securitize, became the first global token issuance platform to join the Japan Security Token Offering Association (JSTOA), the company announced Thursday.      Securitize co-founder and Chief Executive Carlos Domingo told CoinDesk that a leading Japanese financial services company, SBI Holdings, founded JSTOA, and is a Securitize shareholder.      Six major Japanese brokerages formed the association last year in a bid to consolidate expertise on securities and develop security token business opportunities in Japan. It is a state recognized financial instruments and exchange association that operates as a self-regulated entity.      U.S.-based Securitize could not join the association until now because JSTOA only accepted Japanese-regulated entities into its ranks. Securitize Japan is regulated in the country.      “So we had already talked to them, and some of the members about how as soon as the association was open to non-regulated members, we [wanted] to be the first company but we are not,” Domingo said.      Headquartered in San Francisco, Securitize expanded its operations to Japan last year after Japan-based VC firm Global Brain invested in the platform, and has since established a subsidiary company.      Domingo, who lived in Japan for many years and speaks the language, said there were a number of reasons why Securitize wanted to establish business ties with the country.      “Japan has been a very forward-thinking country in terms of blockchain and crypto,” Domingo said.      See also: Japan’s High Court Rejects Former Mt Gox CEO’s Conviction Appeal      According to Domingo, Japanese investors are very active in the blockchain space, and Japan has comprehensive laws on cryptocurrency regulation, although it has had trouble making a clear distinction between digital assets and cryptocurrency. Large financial services institutions are also inclined towards taking advantage of adopting blockchain technology and digitization for securities, Domingo added.      “So, if you put all those things together, we definitely saw that this was an opportunity and moreover, none of our competitors had any presence in Japan,” Domingo said.      In his view, cracking the Japanese market is not an easy task for foreign entities.      “Japan can be intimidating for doing business,” he said, adding that the lack of U.S. or European securities platforms operating in the country gave them a competitive advantage.      The chairman of JSTOA and chief executive of SBI Holdings, Yoshitaka Kitao, said in a statement to the media that Securitize brings years of experience and proven market success in developing and deploying security token technology.      “We are very proud to have them join the JSTOA, and look forward to working alongside them,” Kitao added.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/22/securitizes-japan-subsidiary-becomes-first-international-firm-to-join-self-regulatory-group,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f0374afecc9f5049a185d7b6b005ff1d142c452-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The trial, which was partly funded by the Australia government, surveyed 48 households in Fremantle, Western Australia, and found blockchain energy peer-to-peer energy (P2P) trading delivered lower costs ""desired by consumers.""      “Power Ledger has demonstrated how peer-to-peer energy trading can incentivise the right outcomes for the grid in a more cost-effective way,” Power Ledger chairman Jemma Green said in a press release.      The trial ran between December 2018 and January 2020 as part of the RENeW Nexus Project and used Power Ledger’s blockchain technology to trace the transactions of rooftop solar energy traded between households. RENeW is an Australian national not-for-profit organization advocating for sustainable living.      See also: Power Ledger to Bring Blockchain Energy Trading to West Australian Housing Developments      A report detailing the findings of the trial and published earlier this month in a joint effort between Power Ledger, Curtin and Murdoch Universities found energy trading could provide localized energy markets with the ability to deliver a more stable power grid, at lower costs.      Other findings included how the Australian tariff structure needed an overhaul in order to make P2P energy trading more attractive to the consumer as well as making it more readily accessible to deal with excess solar energy (during the day) in the grid without the need for government subsidies.      “Participants had a positive view of P2P energy trading and could see its benefits but stated that changes to the tariff structure would be required to make it attractive,” the report claimed.      Additionally, the project included a study of a distributed Virtual Power Plant (VPP) as well as a microgrid with a 670kWh battery that is to service homes in the ""East Village development in Fremantle.""      The Village is a sustainable development initiative featuring smart homes powered by green renewable energy.

42404744,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkTom,1592794800,Italian Banks Are Ready to Trial a Digital Euro,"The Italian Banking Association (ABI) announced Thursday its banks are willing to pilot a digital euro.      ABI, made up of over 700 Italian banking institutions, expressed its desire to help speed up the implementation of a digital currency backed by the European Central Bank (ECB) by participating in related projects and experiments. Last year, ABI set up a working group to research digital and crypto assets.      The group shared 10 considerations for a digital euro in Thursday’s announcement, starting with, “Monetary stability and full compliance with the European regulatory framework must be preserved as a matter of priority.”      The group prioritized the need for a digital currency framework to be fully compliant with European Union regulations to win the public’s trust, and said banks will play a critical role in upholding that trust.      In its second guideline, the group said Italian banks are already working with distributed ledger technology, referencing the Spunta project. The project was an initiative by the ABI Lab to integrate blockchain to accelerate the processing of interbank settlements.      According to the group, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would lead to future innovations to the traditional banking system like P2P transactions, machine-to-machine transactions and the ability to manage exchange rate and interest rate risk thanks to the programmable capabilities of digital currencies.      “A programmable digital currency represents an innovation in the financial field capable of profoundly revolutionizing money and exchange. This is a transformation capable of bringing significant potential added value, particularly in terms of the efficiency of the operating and management processes,” the announcement said.      Italy is not the first nation to express an interest in experimenting with a digital euro. Earlier this year, France’s central bank sent out a call for proposals for CBDC experiments. The Dutch Central Bank also announced the Netherlands was willing to trial a digital euro.      Last year, the head of Germany’s Central Bank, Jens Weidmann, in a speech, warned a CBDC could destabilize financial systems. Later in the year, the Association of German Banks made an announcement advocating for a programmable digital euro.
