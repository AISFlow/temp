This sell-off trend has contributed to the further decline of the digital asset&apos;s prices in recent times. However, as the bear run continues, there has been a marked reduction in the amount of BTC being sold off by the holders. The decline in the number of addresses that are sending their coins to centralized exchanges speaks volumes about this. Sellers Beginning To Cool Off Over the last year, the number of bitcoin addresses that had been sending BTC to centralized exchanges, presumably to sell their holdings, had grown incredibly. But had started to decline in recent weeks as the sell-offs had begun to subside.

42422286,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jUxh,1663968196,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops Below $19K Amid Ongoing Volatility,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether both traded lower on Friday following Thursday’s mild increase. Both digital assets continue to trade sideways, as they lack a substantive catalyst to push prices higher.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price fell 4% on moderate volume on Friday, following a 5% increase on Thursday. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now trading below $19,000 and is down 5% week over week. So far this year, bitcoin prices are down 61%.  Ether (ETH) fell 3%, also on moderate volume compared with its 20-day moving average. Ether prices are down 12% week over week and 65% year to date. Since the widely anticipated and successful Ethereum Merge, ETH prices are down approximately 20%. Ether supply has increased by 5,400 post-Merge, though supply would have likely increased by more than 105,000 ETH had it not occurred. So while the Merge has not been deflationary by textbook definition, it has slowed ETH’s inflation rate considerably.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, fell 2.79% on the day.  Economic Calendar: The economic calendar was light today, but there were a couple of items worth considering.  The private sector business activity continues to contract, but not at the rate that was expected. The S&P Global U.S. Composite PMI, which tracks data from manufacturing and service companies, was 49.3 in September. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion of business, while readings below 50 indicate a contraction.  September’s reading was higher than August’s reading of 44, and above expectations for 48. Ironically, business expansion is not ideal for risk assets at the moment, as it will likely prolong the Federal Reserve’s current fight against inflation.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities declined, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 480 points, a 1.6% drop that sent the index to its lowest point of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 both slipped about 2%.  Commodities: Energy sold off as well, with West Texas Intermediate crude oil falling 5.4%. Natural gas declined 3.4%, while European Brent crude and gasoline (RBOB) fell 4.4% and 4.7%, respectively. Despite its safe-haven reputation, gold fell 1.8%. Copper, used as a barometer of economic conditions, decreased 3.6%.  The dollar index (DXY) was stronger, increasing 1.18% and at one point changing hands at 113.23, a 20-year high.  Latest Prices  ● Bitcoin (BTC): $18,895 −1.9%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,304 −1.6%        ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): $945 −1.3%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,693.23 −1.7%        ● Gold: $1,652 per troy ounce −1.1%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.70% −0.01         Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  The USD Continues to Offer the Clearest Signal on BTC Prices  The macroeconomic narrative saturating every pore of crypto-asset markets is difficult to ignore.  With the Federal Reserve trying to stave off inflation by raising interest rates and reducing the size of its $8 trillion balance sheet, risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, will continue to come under pressure.  As interest rates increase, holding the U.S. dollar becomes more attractive because of rising yields. Speaking on Friday’s First Mover program, CoinDesk’s Lawrence Lewitinn likened the current bid behind the dollar to investors who purchased UST in search of higher yield.  The correlative or causative relationship between the two assets remains unclear, but also cannot be easily ignored.  For starters, bitcoin and the U.S. dollar index have an almost completely inverse relationship currently. As recently as November 2021, the opposite could be said as BTC and DXY prices moved relatively in tandem.  Ultimately, the relationship appears to be between BTC and an increase in a risk-on appetite, with the impact occurring via the relationship between BTC and the U.S. dollar. Given the on- again/off-again relationship between the two assets, traders will likely be watching for correlations to shift again.  On a technical basis, BTC appears to be trading near fair value as mentioned in Wednesday’s Market Wrap. Bitcoin’s weekly chart going back to July 2021 shows an asset trading near an area of significant price agreement.  Absent a new bullish catalyst, there doesn’t appear to be much incentive for investors to push prices higher at the moment.  Derivatives markets show some appetite for risk, but little that counters a “neutral for now” narrative. Looking at Glassnode’s BTC open interest by strike price chart, there appears to be elevated put buying at the $18,000 strike price.  A put option represents the right but not the obligation to sell an asset at a specific price. Were bitcoin prices to fall below $18,000, those put options would likely be exercised, putting additional downside pressure on the markets.  Call option purchases (i.e. the right but not the obligation to buy) begin to increase at the $19,500 strike price, a 4% premium to current prices.

Most recently, a bipartisan bill proposed by the U.S. Senate hinted at giving that responsibility to the CFTC, essentially giving the market regulator “exclusive jurisdiction,” and the ability to define what is and is not considered a “digital commodity.”  The CFTC oversees commodities futures, such as oil and metal, including financial currencies, and has taken on a prominent role in crypto. In part that’s because some exchanges, such as the CME, offer bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) trading options. The SEC on the other hand, is responsible for overseeing the securities markets, including stocks and bonds, and more broadly aims to protect investors.  Read more: CFTC Would Become Primary Crypto Regulator Under New Senate Committee Plan  Shirzad said there is “little dispute about the importance of having regulation,” both from progressive and conservative lawmakers, but the issue of which U.S. agency should be charged with regulating the cash market, and having oversight over crypto exchanges, including Coinbase (COIN), is still up in the air. In the past, The SEC has cracked down on the exchange for allegedly marketing its tokens in a manner that would deem them as securities.  Still, Shirzad says it is apparent that “commodities should be regulated by the national commodities regulator, which is the CFTC.” What’s left is transparent regulatory standards.  “Some amount of regulation makes sense for the parts of the crypto economy that need regulation,” Shirzad said. “The thing that members of Congress are most focused on is regulating crypto intermediaries.” Crypto intermediaries, like Coinbase, that take in the public’s money and work as the middleman to delegate market activity, fall under that purview.  “If any particular regulator thinks any particular token is one thing, the degree to which we can have clarity on that allows us to operate under clearer guidelines and allows us to do what we need to do,” Shirzad said.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  The Brazilian Federal Police began raids on six undisclosed crypto exchanges on Thursday in an investigation into tax evasion and money laundering involving the use of cryptocurrencies.  As part of Operation Colossus executed in conjunction with the Brazilian tax authority, the Federal Police is carrying out 101 warrants issued by a criminal court in São Paulo, according to an official police report. They include two arrest warrants and 37 search and seizure warrants.  In addition, the police ordered the freezing of roughly $238 million in assets and securities held by those under investigation, and they also seized an undisclosed amount of virtual assets held by 28 exchanges under investigation.  The investigations stemmed from a report conducted by Brazil's Financial Intelligence, which found suspicious bank activity linked to the trading of crypto assets. The alleged crimes occurred between 2017 and 2021, but according to the Brazilian police they are ongoing.  This article was translated by Andrés Engler, and edited by CoinDesk.

42422287,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jUvh,1663955153,Troubled Data Center Compute North Struggled With Crypto Winter. Then Its Relationship With a Major Lender Soured,"Compute North’s bankruptcy filing was caused by trouble dealing with one of its biggest lenders – Generate Capital – along with market headwinds and supply-chain disruptions, according to the newly appointed chief financial officer of the operator of data centers used by crypto miners.  The company’s Chapter 11 case, revealed Thursday, has rocked a mining industry already under pressure due to the crypto bear market and a global energy crisis, which raises the cost to mine new tokens. Compute North, which makes most of its revenue by hosting the computers of miners, is a well-known name in the industry with clients such as Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Bit Digital (BTBT) and BitNile (NILE). The shares of all three miners fell on Friday.  Read more: Crypto-Mining Data Center Compute North Files for Bankruptcy, CEO Steps Down  Compute North’s long-term debt stands at $128.3 million, CFO Harold Coulby said in a filing. About $99.8 million of that is in the form of a senior secured promissory note to renewable energy prodiver NextEra, another $21 million in a similar note to miner Marathon and $7.5 million lies with an equipment financing loan with digital asset mining and staking firm Foundry (which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group).  The big lender  In explaining the bankruptcy in a filing Friday, Chief Financial Officer Harold Coulby pointed to one of the firm’s biggest creditors. In February, Generate Capital agreed to lend up to $300 million to Compute North to finance projects in Nebraska and later Texas, the CFO said. As part of the financing agreements, the lender received a “a right of first refusal to finance all of Compute North’s future projects and the right to appoint a director” to its board of directors.  Out of the $300 million credit facility from Generate Capital, about $101 million is currently outstanding, according to Houlby's filing.  Generate Capital did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment at the time of publication.  In July, the lender asserted several “technical events of default,” which led to taking control of Compute North assets. Generate Capital exercised its voting rights to take over Compute North subsidiary that owned the two bitcoin mining sites the two firms were developing. That included the Wolf Hollow site in Texas, slated to run at 300 megawatts (MW) capacity initially and 600 MW at a later stage, which would make it the miner’s biggest operation. Because Generate Capital has already seized assets, it is not counted among the current creditors.  Also in the second quarter, Generate Capital stopped the funding for new sites other than the ones in Texas and Nebraska, according to Coulby.  The hosting firm couldn’t find an alternative source of funding and therefore couldn’t complete the buildout of its mines, the CFO said. In the weeks that followed it tried to come up with a solution with Generate Capital and other prospective investors, but couldn’t find one in time.  Making matters worse, supply-chain disruptions, soaring energy prices and the decline in bitcoin prices squeezed Compute North’s already tight liquidity. The firm put down $30.9 million in 2021 and $41.4 million in 2022 on deposits for fixed assets like transformers, which take a long time to be delivered, said Coulby.  “Facing the threat of ongoing degradation to the value of its business, including the potential termination of contracts that Compute North may be able to assign in a sale transaction, Compute North had no choice but to commence these Chapter 11 Cases in order to preserve and maximize the value of its assets,” he wrote.  Read more: Foundry Starts New Service to Reduce Supply-Chain Lag for Bitcoin Miners  Corporate structure  At the time of the bankruptcy filing, Compute North operated 259 MW of bitcoin mines, the CFO said. Last year, the firm brought in $34.1 million from hosting mining machines, $19.1 million from selling equipment and $12.1 million from self-mining.  In the filing, Coulby described a complex system of subsidiaries under which Compute North managed its operations. Bitcoin mining facilities were handled by different subsidiaries, some of whom were owned in part by its creditors.  The bear market is taking a heavy toll on the crypto mining industry, as miners with heavy debt loads keep falling victim to the crypto winter. Most recently, Celsius Network's mining unit, which said in March it planned to go public, also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, along with its parent company.

42421446,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMX7,1663952400,Is Powell 2022’s Paul Volcker? The Answer Matters to Bitcoin,"What if Jerome Powell wins the inflation fight?  In the wake of the Federal Reserve’s big rate hike this week, some commentators are comparing the Fed chairman with one of his predecessors: Paul Volcker. The Fed’s leader under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan introduced aggressive monetary tightening in the early 1980s, which thrust the U.S. into a recession but rammed inflation down to consistently low levels. That led to a decades-long period of prosperity known as the “Great Moderation.” Can the increasingly hawkish Powell have similar success?  Before we address that, let’s note that it’s a critical question for bitcoin, whose advocates position it as “sound money,” a more reliable system for protecting purchasing power that’s immune to the human failings of fiat-based monetary policy.  Whether Bitcoin succeeds will largely hinge on whether people have confidence in the incumbent fiat system to which it poses an alternative and in the central bankers who, since the end of the dollar’s gold peg 1973, have determined the monetary policies behind that system. If people lose faith in central banks, the idea goes, currencies will falter, exacerbating inflationary pressures and driving users to alternatives like gold or bitcoin.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe here to get the full newsletter.  So, in the minds of bitcoiners, this a major test moment for Powell.  To be fair, in light of cratered crypto markets, bitcoin is also being put to a major test right now. But it’s Powell we’re focused on here. Can he do another Volcker?  Myth, message and reality  In the 1980s, Volcker almost single-handedly restored trust in the global fiat system. Taking a politically difficult stand that reinforced the economy’s long-term health earned him quasi-sainthood in financial circles – the antithesis of his predecessor, the hapless Arthur F. Burns. Volcker also demonstrated to governments and their voters the value of central bank independence.  Among economists, conventional wisdom now holds that if a country’s political leaders ignore Volcker’s legacy and stop central banks from making tough decisions, markets will punish them. Currency failures such as Zimbabwe’s, Argentina’s and Turkey’s are pointed to as examples. By contrast, the U.S. economy’s long, mostly steady and rarely interrupted expansion since Volcker’s 1982 recession, and the concurrent 40-year growth in its stock market – with a more than 100-fold increase in the S&P 500 to its peak last year – is presented as proof of the payoff to those who play by the rules.  The reality is much more complicated.  As we discussed two weeks ago, the dollar’s status as the dominant reserve currency gives the U.S. unique latitude with monetary policy and creates fallout in other countries.  In the years following the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed’s highly accommodative monetary policy pushed “hot money” into developing economies, making policymaking doubly difficult there. Now that the dollar is resurging, hot money is fleeing back to the U.S., forcing central banks everywhere to follow the Fed’s monetary tightening lead to protect their currencies, whether their economies warrant that or not. Volckerism isn’t exercised on a level playing field.  Read more: Emerging Markets Lead Global Crypto Adoption in Bear Market, Chainalysis Says  Political risks vs reputational risks  These global imbalances and the “quantitative easing” (QE) monetary policies they permitted have reached a breaking point. They fueled a massive debt buildup in the U.S. and elsewhere, which will become much harder to reckon with now that interest rates are rising.  The policy reversal will prompt a flood of bankruptcies and an economic contraction, and there’s no guarantee it will tame inflation. That could remain propped up by war-fueled commodity price gains, supply chain inefficiencies and entrenched, self-fulfilling expectations. What will Powell’s Fed do in that environment? Will it push even harder, driving the U.S. economy into a much deeper hole?  My bet is “no.” There is too much at risk politically. The pressure to soften monetary conditions again will be too strong once U.S. businesses are shuttering en masse and hordes of Americans are losing jobs. And when that happens, as low-cost money is again pushed out into the world in search of risky assets, bitcoin will benefit as one target of those flows.  Read more: Here’s What’s In the White House’s Crypto Reports  But the bigger, longer-term issue is not whether the Fed could be pulled into this whipsaw response, but what Powell’s bold new stance will do to his and other central bankers’ reputation over time.  If he succeeds in cooling speculative excesses and ushers in another era of predictable, moderate inflation, Powell could give the entire fiat system and its dollar-based center a shot in the arm for years to come. It will make it hard for bitcoin – or gold, for that matter – to make an alternative case.  A lot is resting on this. It’s not enough for bitcoiners to say the dollar has steadily lost purchasing power because of inflation. What most people want is predictability. Far from worrying about a 2% annual inflation rate depleting the value of their dollars, investors were comfortable with that consistency during the Great Moderation. A return to similar stability would be a huge win for fiat.  This is not 1982  What does success mean, though? Ultimately, it comes down to our perception of the outcome. The problem is Powell is trying to explain his strategies in a far more hostile environment than Volcker faced.  In 1982, the U.S. had the wind at its back. The computing revolution was just starting, which put the country on the cusp of a productivity boom, while the more disruptive aspects of the internet age were still in the distant future. The U.S. was on the verge of winning the Cold War and had mostly gotten over the social tensions of the Vietnam War. Most important, the wealth gap was nowhere near as extreme as it is now. Americans were optimistic.  Fast forward to 2022. There’s a war in Ukraine, which led to Russia’s (and potentially China’s) exit from the dollar-centric global financial system. The planet faces a climate disaster and an entire generation of teenagers and twentysomethings is emerging from a global pandemic with an abiding cynicism toward an ossified 20-century capitalist order.  Meanwhile, it has become so much harder for the Fed, or any policymaker, to control the message. I’m not talking about their communication channels with bond traders, which they use to signal market rate adjustments; I’m talking about communicating with us, we the public.  At the end of the day, what matters for a central bank charged with protecting a currency’s value is the judgment of the currency’s everyday users. These days, those people’s views are shaped by social media, a sprawling, unpredictable system captured by bots and trolls. This makes it very difficult for policymakers to manage their message and sustain trust.  Success is far, far from guaranteed for Powell. That means that bitcoin, for now, remains relevant.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Michael J.

The move comes amid a renewed push by crypto firms looking to bring ""tokenomics"" into real-world assets – an endeavor that has mixed results in crypto. Tokenomics is a catch-all for the elements that make a particular cryptocurrency valuable or interesting to investors, including token supply, utility, etc.  Read more: Tokenized Real Estate Falters as Another Hyped Deal Falls Apart  But the new Ethereum-based token from Eurion is not trying to give investors an ownership stake in Swiss chalets or city skyscrapers, as previous crypto real estate efforts have pursued. Instead, it will approach a simpler, less regulatory complex use case: influence.  “We're not tokenizing assets, so they don't own anything,"" the firm’s CEO, David Niewiadomski, told CoinDesk in an interview, explaining “ the focus is on giving “decision-making” powers to token holders.  The ERN token, which will be listed on Uniswap, will give its secondary owners an irrefutable vote in Eurion's investment decisions, Niewiadomski told CoinDesk. He believes that the token is not a security as per U.S. law.  The firm is setting a minimum target of $4.5 million, he said, adding that the total supply will be capped at 1 billion tokens.  Without delivering ownership to its holders, the token will hold its value through buybacks that “will raise its floor price over time,"" according to its press release.  “As profit is generated from investor selected assets, a portion of that profit will be used to buy back tokens that can never be sold. This will in turn decrease circulating supply. So over time the amount that is bought and cannot be sold will grow as the portfolio of investor selected assets grows,"" Niewiadomski said.

42421442,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMRx,1663942798,The Most Important Bear Market in Crypto History,"I spent Thursday at Messari’s Mainnet conference, which was certainly bustling but, it must be said, slightly subdued compared with CoinDesk’s Consensus festival in June. That’s not to knock Messari. If Consensus didn’t exist, Mainnet might be the best all-around crypto conference. The difference is mainly a matter of timing: Consensus caught the trailing edge of a frenetic bull market, and now we’re definitively in the season of the bear.  Every bear cycle in crypto is greeted with a degree of relief by founders, engineers and other insiders, because they’re freed from the hamster wheel of chasing deposits, users and mainstream attention, and instead able to focus on building for the long term, both technologically and strategically.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Mainnet offered a few glimpses of where projects are focusing their off-season energy this time around. One major theme is the financial and engineering push for more capital efficiency in decentralizedfinance (DeFi) and other on-chain services – that is, finding ways to safely get more leverage or liquidity out of less collateral. That could be a huge competitive differentiator in the future - though the competition is also certain to produce some overreach and blowups.  Another goal (however obvious) is building much more user-friendly front-ends for crypto applications. There are also major unanswered security questions, highlighted by yet another round of huge hacks this week. That’s a particularly ideal bear-market project: Without the pressure to move fast, you can take more care to build things that aren’t easy to break.  See also: Bitcoin Should Change ... Slowly | Opinion  Of course, you have to fund that kind of development, and both revenue and retail speculation have substantially shrunk. The good news is that venture investment is definitely continuing. One founder who completed a recent raise told me, though, that in the bear market, bigger bets are going to fewer entities. In essence, VCs are still going long crypto and blockchain. They’re just a lot more selective than a year ago.  That’s all well and good, but it’s not enough. Thanks to the combination of macroeconomic pressures like inflation and the broad losses suffered by retail speculators, the big challenge for this bear market – and an unknown that I find myself considering for the first time in my decade covering crypto – is making sure there even is another bull market.  Extreme cyclicality has been a hallmark of the crypto industry since its inception. That’s certainly not unique – we found out this year that the broader tech market can still experience painful drawdowns, three decades after AOL sent out its first CD-ROM. But the cycles in crypto can be particularly sharp and painful because not only is this still largely a speculative technology, it’s one that retail investors can dabble in with few restrictions or safeguards.  That’s why the current bear market may be the most important in crypto’s history. In the unprecedented bull market from 2020 to 2022, a critical mass of retail investors was enticed by the past returns of the asset class. Exchanges, non-fungible token (NFT) producers and others focused on retail were more than happy to court them with Super Bowl commercials and major media appearances. And then, by and large, retail got severely burned, by the bursting of a transitory bubble (BTC and ETH) or, far worse, by the collapse of deeply flawed and even fraudulent projects.  I moderated a panel at Mainnet about the strategic balance between catering to big-money whales, day-trading degens and “newbs,” aka normal human beings. The trap for many crypto projects is that while the big, easy returns come from whales and degens, those users are also hyper-agile “rotator capital,” willing and able to pull up stakes and move their entire net worth to a new system for a few extra basis points of APR.  See also: How DeFi 'Degens' Are Funding the Next Wave of Open Source Software | Opinion  More importantly, degens and whales are speculators and liquidity providers, not “users” proper. To eventually reduce market cyclicality, crypto projects need to find actual use cases where they can beat existing services. For now, the obvious cases are still pretty limited: cross-border payments (mostly meaningful for BTC), NFTs (mostly meaningful for ETH) and, to a lesser extent, gaming – where there is a huge market, but the actual advantages of crypto are a bit less clear.  There will be a lot more real end-user services and products to add to that list. Some won’t come along until the technology has advanced further, whether in terms of throughput or user interface. But the industry needs them yesterday. One final clear advantage of a bear market is that, with speculators in retreat, it’s much easier to find and test the demand for real products that offer real benefits. That’s the task that lies before blockchain entrepreneurs right now.  Finally, a couple of blind items for those who stuck with me to the end.

Riley,"Bitcoin miner Iris Energy (IREN) signed a deal to sell up to $100 million in equity to investment bank B. Riley over the next two years, marking the bank's second big investment in the industry that is facing serious market headwinds.  Publicly traded bitcoin miners have seen their stock prices tumble this year as the price of bitcoin has slumped by as much as 60% and energy costs soar. In July, B. Riley signed a similar deal in nature and size with Core Scientific (CORZ), the largest bitcoin miner in the world by actual hashrate, or computing power.  Iris has the right, but not the obligation to sell B. Riley the stock, according to the filings. The miner may sell B. Riley up to 25 million of IREN ordinary shares in the 24 months starting Friday, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission. If the miner sells all the shares to the bank, for about $100 million, B. Riley would have an up to 31% stake in the miner, the filing said.  As part of the deal, Iris may elect, in its sole discretion, to issue and sell up to 24.8 million shares to B. Riley Principal Capital II and about 198,174 ordinary shares as consideration for the bank’s commitment to the deal.  Iris intends to use any proceeds from the deal to fund company's growth, including hardware purchases, acquisition, development of data center facilities, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Market Move: Ethereum miners have $319 million in ether that they theoretically could start dumping, which would weigh on the price.  Chart of the Day: The discount between the price of liquid-staking protocol Lido's staked ether (stETH) and the price of ether (ETH) has pretty much evaporated, according to data source Dune Analytics.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was sliding after a surprisingly strong performance on Thursday – a 5.1% gain that was the largest cryptocurrency’s best single-day return in two weeks.  “Bitcoin continues to display strong resilience in the face of a broader risk-averse mood in financial markets,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote in an investor update. “Given it is the ultimate risk asset, this is quite surprising and perhaps even encouraging.”  Traditional markets were reeling Friday from signs that there’s no easy fix for the global economic challenges, with activity slowing or possibly even contracting, inflation still persistent and central bankers ratcheting monetary conditions tighter.  The U.K. pound tumbled as the government announced a plan to stimulate the economy through tax cuts – prompting fresh inflation warnings from economists and leading traders to bet on faster interest-rate hikes by the Bank of England.  The dollar surged to a new record valuation in foreign-exchange markets, which is likely seen as a negative for bitcoin, because the cryptocurrency often trades in an inverse relationship to the greenback. As of press time, bitcoin was changing hands around $18,900.  The CoinDesk Market Index was roughly flat over the past 24 hours.  Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, wrote in his latest blog post that he thinks ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, will outperform bitcoin following last week’s successful completion of the Ethereum blockchain’s Merge: “The price of ETH continues to get smoked due to deteriorating USD liquidity, but give the changes in the supply and demand dynamics time to percolate. Check back in a few months, and I suspect you’ll see that the dramatic reduction in supply has created a strong and rising floor on the price.”  CoinDesk Market Index  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cronos CRO  +10.77% Currency Ribbon Finance RBN  +4.38% DeFi Alchemy Pay ACH  +3.84% Currency  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra Luna Classic LUNA  -7.51% Smart Contract Platform ApeCoin APE  -5.81% Culture & Entertainment Celsius CEL  -4.91% Currency  Sector classifications are provided via the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), developed by CoinDesk Indices to provide a reliable, comprehensive and standardized classification system for digital assets.

Market Moves  Ethereum Miners’ $319M Crypto Hoard Hangs Over Market After Merge  By Jocelyn Yang  In the years and months leading up to the Ethereum blockchain’s historic shift last week to a more energy-efficient system, data miners working for rewards on the network had accumulated nearly $341 million worth of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH).  Now, a week after the Merge, crypto analysts are warning that miners’ sales of their hoards could become a source of near-term, downward pressure on the cryptocurrency's price, with the market already sinking by 19% in the past month.  “Miners dumping their ETH is an overhang that we’ll have to get through over the coming months in order to resume up-only mode, but it will happen,” Lucas Campbell, editor of the Bankless newsletter, wrote Monday.  Ethereum miners dumped more than 16,000 ETH from Sept. 12 to Sept. 19. (The Merge took effect on Sept. 15.) The decline reduced the miners’ combined balance to about 245,000 ETH, or about $319 million worth.  Read the full story here.  Chart of the Day  Lido's stETH Trades Almost at Par With Ether  By Omkar Godbole  The discount between the price of liquid-staking protocol Lido's staked ether (stETH) and the price of ether (ETH) has pretty much evaporated, according to data source Dune Analytics.  Investors have piled into stETH since the Ethereum blockchain switched to proof-of-stake technology on Sept. 15.  According to Nansen, the so-called ""smart money"" has poured $33 million into the stETH token in seven days.  The token came under pressure early this month as some investors switched to ether to collect a potential Ethereum fork token ETHPoW.

42373753,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvV5Pl,1663930882,Celsius Shareholders File to Stake Their Claim for Bankruptcy Payouts,"Holders of preferred equity in failed cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network want to make sure they’re at the table in talks on clawing back their investments, as well as first dibs on proceeds from the sale of certain assets, saying they are worried the bankruptcy process is overly focused on retail customers.  Law firm Milbank LLP filed a motion in the bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York to appoint a Preferred Equity Committee to represent Series A and Series B shareholders, and to place them at the front of the queue when it comes to the sale of custody firm GK8 and the Celsius mining operations.  “Not only is the UCC [Unsecured Creditors Committee] laser focused on maximizing value for the customers, without regard for the Equity Holders, but the Debtors also have made it abundantly clear that the UCC is their partner, and these cases are all about the customer,” the statement said.  The lawyers said a fiduciary is needed to take the equity holders’ side of the dispute before a plan of reorganization is proposed that “violates the Bankruptcy Code.”  The action on the part of the shareholders, who poured some $750 million in Series B funding into the company just months before it sank into bankruptcy, creates another faction of claimants.  In a move that will further divide the Celsius case, the motion also requests that the court caps claims at the U.S. dollar value as of the date of the bankruptcy petition date. Effectively, this means that if cryptocurrency prices increase over the course of the proceedings, the upside goes to the equity holders and not the customers. If crypto goes down, however, customers take a hit.  “This is a total bombshell likely to alienate the entire creditor body and constituencies,” Thomas Braziel, founder of bankruptcy investment specialist 507 Capital, said in an interview. “It is potentially leading to World War III in the Celsius case.”  See also: Celsius Network Might Be Planning to Turn Its Debt Into Crypto ‘IOU’ Tokens",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | MINING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/23/celsius-shareholders-file-to-stake-their-claim-in-bankruptcy-payouts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d740ad197e23d06f1464b6de04f19b26716f1b0-5000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This action followed its 6% gain as of yesterday. Meanwhile, Ripple Coin (XRP) seems to be among the notable digital tokens in the bullish trend. Investors incurred huge losses due to the ongoing crypto winter. Many believed that the Ethereum Merge would halt the market&apos;s bearish trend. On the contrary, most altcoins, including BTC, depreciate their prices.

As of September 20, BTC gained some push to arrive at $19,500. The 24-hour growth of 1.72% reduced its weekly losses to around 10.90%.

This report takes a look at the unique offerings provided by both crypto and forex trading, as well as the benefits associated with these highly sought-after markets. Benefits Of Forex Trading Forex trading is one of the oldest and largest forms of trading currently available. Simply put, it is the conversion of one currency to another in a bid to make money when one currency gains or loses strength against another currency.

Liquidity One of the most important things when it comes to trading any type of asset is having enough liquidity. Given that the forex market is the largest in the world, recording an estimated $6.6 trillion in daily trading volume, there is a lot of liquidity in the market.

This was a groundbreaking moment for the crypto industry. Although the Merge was anticipated to boost investor confidence, it occurred at the worst possible time. The Merge took place at an interesting point in crypto history. The update went up on September 15—just two days after the United States CPI data was made public. There was a widespread selloff in the stock markets because of the Federal Reserve&apos;s interest rate increase, reporting its annual inflation rate hike of 0.1%, and affecting the cryptocurrency market. On the day of publication, Bitcoin dropped 12.71 percent, and Ethereum fell 12.67 percent.

In a motion filed Thursday evening, the state’s Assistant Attorney General Stephen Manning asked Judge Martin Glenn, who is overseeing the case, to admit him on behalf of Washington’s financial regulator.  Securities regulators in Washington, Alabama, Kentucky, New Jersey and Texas began an investigation into Celsius after the company suspended customer redemptions in June.  While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been working with its counterparts to regulate crypto via Washington, D.C., states such as Washington have taken a more active approach in regulation as there’s a growing belief that the Feds are moving too slowly.  The Vermont Department of Financial Regulation perhaps had the strongest words regarding Celsius when it suggested in September that the company’s structure resembled a Ponzi scheme.  ""This shows a high level of financial mismanagement and also suggests that, at least at some points in time, yields to existing investors were probably being paid with the assets of new investors,"" the filing from Vermont said.

42373742,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvV5ER,1663905600,"Ethereum Merge Vastly Increased Stakefish’s Profile, but 25% of Its Employees Are Gone Anyway","On the very day that the Ethereum Merge dramatically elevated the importance of validators in the blockchain’s ecosystem, one of the biggest ones – stakefish – was beset with chaos.  More than 25% of its workforce, according to people familiar with the matter, was either laid off or resigned, including two senior departures: Head of Strategy and Operations Jun Soo Kim and Head of Protocols Daniel Hwang.  CoinDesk spoke with four current and former employees for this story, all of whom took issue with how the layoffs were handled. One of the employees asked not to be identified because they signed a non-disclosure agreement. In total, right when stakefish was set to rake in big rewards for securing Ethereum’s new miner-free network, eight employees were laid off and three more resigned from the company.  According to these employees and internal messages reviewed by CoinDesk, workers were not informed they would be let go from stakefish until a few days before their termination date, Sept. 15. That was also the day of the Ethereum Merge – precisely the event for which stakefish had spent years laying crucial groundwork because that day was when Ethereum officially shifted from being run by miners to validator operators like stakefish.  When asked for comment via the messaging service Telegram, Chun Wang, the CEO and founder of stakefish, wrote: “It is normal in a bear market to reduce team size and optimize costs.” He added: “Only non-tech positions are laid off. We’re still working hard to hire more developers and devops.”  Kim’s resignation in particular marks a major blow to stakefish, which offers customers the ability to help secure proof-of-stake blockchains like the newly revamped Ethereum in exchange for rewards. According to former employees, Kim, whose resignation will take effect in October, was viewed as a potential replacement for Wang and served as a sort of interim CEO whenever the company’s founder was absent.  Kim told CoinDesk that he decided to leave in order to start his own venture.  Hwang, the only member of stakefish’s senior leadership to be included in the layoffs, opted to resign rather than accept a two-week severance package, which he told CoinDesk he considered “insulting.” Another employee who spoke to CoinDesk reported having been offered the same deal. (For comparison, Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange that laid off 18% of its workforce earlier this year, offered its employees a minimum of 14 weeks severance pay).  Hwang said he was tipped off that he would be let go by Andrea “Dimi” Di Michele, one of his direct reports. Dimi, who was appointed as Hwang’s replacement and was one of stakefish’s longest-serving employees, resigned from the company a few days later.  “They gave, like, two days' notice,” Dimi told CoinDesk. “I don't want to throw shade on stakefish – it’s not my intention – but I think it's not fair what's going on,” he said. “In general, stakefish had a great opportunity to do something great,” he added. “I'm very disappointed.”  Ethereum’s switch from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system handed the reins of the second-largest blockchain from miners to validators that “stake” ether (ETH), Ethereum's native currency, by sending it to an address on the chain where it cannot be bought or sold. Stakefish, which sets up interest-earning validators on behalf of its customers, controlled around 2% of all staked ETH at press time. It is also a major validator in other ecosystems, including Cosmos, Polkadot, Polygon and Solana.  Stakefish is based in the British Virgin Islands and has co-working spaces in Palo Alto, California and Seoul, South Korea. Most of its staff works remotely.  Wang, stakefish’s founder, co-founded F2Pool, the third-largest bitcoin (BTC) mining pool. Employees told CoinDesk the two companies frequently collaborate and share resources.  As news of the layoffs spread across stakefish, several employees took to the company’s Slack messaging platform to air their grievances around how information had been communicated to employees.  “I have to express my opinion that this layoff is implemented in a horrible way,” one employee wrote. “Keeping everything quiet makes the top management’s words untrustworthy. It only makes low morale much lower, and the employees have no idea what to expect next. Lower morale, more people will decide to go. Maybe that’s the goal?”  “I understand the decision however the implementation of this decision by those in HR has been for want of a better word horrific,” responded another employee. “Letting people know in a staggered fashion that they are to be fired with 2 days notice as if rumors and news like that does not travel sideways in a company is absolutely unbelievable.”  This employee reported hearing of the layoffs on a call with their team. “Upon further pushing we found out that people currently on this call were yet to hear that they are in fact fired, which as you can understand left us all dumbstruck,” they wrote.  “As of today 1 member of the marketing team has still not been contacted by anyone that they are to be fired tomorrow,” responded a third employee.

The ruling will allow the federal tax agency to continue looking for potential tax evaders in an ongoing probe.  The summons requires M.Y. Safra Bank to provide information about the SFOX customers who may not have reported and paid taxes on crypto transactions. In August, the IRS received authorization from a California judge to serve a ""John Doe"" summons on SFOX itself.  “The government’s ability to obtain third-party information on those failing to report their gains from digital assets remains a critical tool in catching tax cheats,"" IRS Commissioner Charles P.

""The court’s granting of the John Doe summons reinforces our ongoing, significant efforts to ensure that everyone pays their fair share.""  M.Y. Safra Bank is not alleged to have engaged in wrongdoing, the DOJ release said.  The IRS has previously served such summons's on companies like Kraken and Circle, and typically does so when it wants to confirm whether the recipient's customers are properly reporting their taxes. Cryptocurrency transactions are taxed like property, with the IRS collecting capital gains tax on every transaction.  The California judge's ruling authorized the IRS to serve a summons against SFOX, asking for information about any ""U.S. taxpayers who conducted at least the equivalent of $20,000 in transactions in cryptocurrency between 2016 and 2021 with or through SFOX.

Bitcoin and Ether Rebound  By James Rubin  Bitcoin spent much of Thursday regaining ground lost in the fitful aftermath of the U.S. central bank's latest interest rate hike a day earlier.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading around $19,350, up about 5% over the past 24 hours. BTC dipped below $18,400 late Wednesday afternoon (UTC), its lowest level since early June, following the Fed's 75 basis point increase, but crypto investors started to return in Thursday's early hours.  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,330, a 7% gain from the previous day when it dropped below $1,250 for the first time since July. The second-largest crypto by market value has declined in recent days amid wider economic concerns and a post-Merge hangover. The Merge is the technological overhaul of the Ethereum blockchain to a more energy efficient proof-of-stake protocol.  Other cryptos followed a similar path, beginning their rallies from the previous day's carnage early Thursday and spending most of the day in the green. XRP and CHZ recently jumped more than 20% and 16%, respectively. ALGO rose over 11%.  Stocks  Equity markets veered in a different direction from crypto prices for one of the few times in recent months with the tech-focused Nasdaq off more than 1% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) both down a few fractions of a point. The declines came amid ongoing inflationary fretfulness that has prompted several central banks to raise their interest rates and protect their currencies.  ""The markets are not done de-risking,"" Mark Connors, head researcher at Canadian digital asset firm 3iQ, told CoinDesk. ""The [Federal Reserve] will not change stance any time soon, and we are very close to posting a third consecutive down quarter in U.S. GDP.""  Connors added: ""People are realizing this is not going to be a short-term pivot, that growth is slowing and the Feds are not done hiking.""  Rate hikes  On Thursday, the Bank of England boosted its interest rate for a seventh straight time, and the banks of Switzerland and Norway also announced rate hikes. The BOE's second consecutive hefty half-percentage point increase sent its rate to 2.25% as the country aims to combat surging prices for energy and household goods. Japan's historically dovish central bank has left rates low, but the government has begun to purchase yen to prop up its price.  In the ongoing saga of Celsius Network, the beleaguered crypto lender now appears to be considering a plan to turn its debt into crypto “IOU” (“I Owe You”) tokens, CoinDesk's Cheyenne Ligon reported. And the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued an order filing and settling charges against blockchain software protocol bZeroX and its founders, the CFTC announced in a press release Thursday. The order penalizes the protocol and its founders Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner $250,000 for offering illegal, off-exchange trading of digital assets and other violations.  Despite the current turmoil in crypto markets, 3iQ's Mark Connors believes that barring unforeseen events, bitcoin will outpace traditional assets in the months ahead forming what he described as ""a nice band around $19,000 to $20,000.""  ""As we absorb [a] higher rate environment, lower growth environment, I think bitcoin and [ether] will hold value while the market retreats,"" he said.

Insights  As the Fed Hikes Rates, Ether, USDC Lending Yields Pay Less Than T-Bills  By Sam Reynolds  In the prelapsarian days of 2021’s bull market, Alex Mashinsky, the CEO of Celsius Network, said the 8.8% yield paid on stablecoin deposits was “the true value of the dollar.”  Fast forward to September 2022. Celsius has filed for bankruptcy protection, and some of the surviving decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols have less yield than bonds – and even savings accounts.  According to DeFiPrime, the average yield one can expect for lending USDC via DeFi protocols is 0.98%.  Aave and Compound are paying 0.41% and 0.71%, respectively. In early April, Aave was paying depositors 2.67%.  Rates for other digital assets on the two protocols aren’t much better. DeFi Rate, a data aggregator, puts interest for bitcoin at 0.01% on Compound, 0.09% on Aave. Ether pays out 0.21% yield, while Aave is at 0.97%.  In contrast, the current one-year Treasury bond is paying 4.08%, up almost a full percentage point from early August – and its highest level since 2007 – as the Federal Reserve makes historical moves to control inflation..  ""If the Fed remains hawkish, we are likely to see markets test lower lows and remain muted until inflation figures appear to start improving,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in an earlier statement.  The story here is in utilization rate, a measure of how much of the available supply of capital is being used by borrowers.  Across all protocols and assets, it's at near-historical lows.  On-chain data from Aave shows that utilization of USDC is at 21%, down from around 90% this time last year. On Compound, it's around 34%. (Compound doesn’t make its historical data easily available.)  Ether on Aave still has a relatively high utilization rate, but it's in a peculiar situation. Just before the Ethereum Merge, nearly all the available ether on the protocol was used up as traders borrowed it – paying up to 103% interest at the peak – to create a large pool of tokens for themselves in order to receive airdropped forked tokens such as ETHPOW.  While utilization has dropped to 47%, higher than USDC, it still is lower than the pre-Ethereum Merge rate of around 63% from a month ago. Interest rates for borrowers are back at around 2.7%.  Of course, all this isn’t to say you can’t chase yield with tokens. There’s just not as much of it available.  Centralized lending (CeFi) protocol Maple Finance is still paying out double-digit interest to depositors to put their USDC in available lending pools.  But these are blue chip borrowers like Alamada Research, Amber Group and Wintermute. Of course, for new loans there’s just not the return there once was: Rates are now between 7.5% and 11%, compared with the 15% available last year. Rates lower when that loan is denominated in ether.  CeFi lending comes with its risks, though, as CoinDesk documents here in its learn section.  The Fed’s quest to control inflation with higher interest rates means there are many savings accounts that offer over 2% interest to depositors – more than what some DeFi protocols are paying for USDC and ether.  As an added bonus, they come with FDIC insurance.
