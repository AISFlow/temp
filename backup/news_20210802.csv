The text’s definition of a broker is too broad, according to Toomey, and affects non-financial services parties, like bitcoin miners, that he said should be exempt. Plus, non-custodial services would struggle to properly file identification forms with the Internal Revenue Service, he said.      “Congress should not rush forward with this hastily-designed tax reporting regime for cryptocurrency, especially without a full understanding of the consequences,” he said in a press statement.      Toomey promised to amend the bill. He is now looking for a Democrat senator as co-sponsor, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Spagni, known online as “Fluffypony,” is accused of stealing approximately $100,000 from his former employer, Cape Cookies, by generating false invoices from fictional entities and routing payment to his personal bank accounts between 2009-2011.      Spagni was previously charged with fraud and related charges in a regional court in Cape Town, but pleaded not guilty and failed to appear in court. According to court documents, South African authorities could not find Spagni at his home address in South Africa. After speaking with Spagni’s friends and family they learned Spagni had fled South Africa.      South African police issued a warrant for Spagni’s arrest in April.      Spagni's wife, Saskia Spagni, tweeted a message on her husband's behalf on Monday in which he said, ""Unfortunately, due to a misunderstanding with regards to the setting of court dates in an old matter, which I have continuously been trying to resolve since 2011, I have been held in contempt of court and currently awaiting extradition.""      Spagni added that he was hoping to resolve the issue soon and that ""in the meantime my business affairs will continue under the leadership of my partners.""      Though Spagni stepped down from his day-to-day leadership role in 2019 after five years with the privacy-focused project, he was still a public representative of Monero and often took responsibility for coordinating Monero’s press and public-facing information.      Spagni was arrested in Nashville when a private charter jet he was using for a trip from New York to Los Cabos, Mexico, stopped for fuel.      According to the arrest warrant, Spagni is currently in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and will be held without bail until his extradition.      Spagni is believed to have “significant cryptocurrency assets that would enable him to flee” as well as a “watch valued at $800,000,” according to the warrant.

42387410,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBtE6F,1627935570,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Underperforms Ether; Crypto Tax Ahead?,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher on Monday as bullish sentiment continues into August. Bitcoin underperformed other major cryptocurrencies and is down about 3% over the past 24 hours compared to a 2% rise in ether over the same period.      Buyers remain active despite ongoing regulatory crackdowns in China. On Sunday, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) said it will keep applying high regulatory pressure on crypto trading, mostly due to concerns about financial risk.      Traders are also digesting the 58-page “Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, proposed by Rep. Don Beyer’s (D-Va.), seeking to create an exhaustive regulatory regime for digital assets. The U.S. Senate is also advancing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill with a crypto tax provision, which could be a source of market anxiety.      For now, a breakdown on intraday charts “suggests that bitcoin may fall back to the mid-range at around $36,000, or lower, before the rally continues,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, in an email to CoinDesk    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $39,164.5, -5.06%  Ether (ETH) $2,604.8, -2.05%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4387.15, -0.18%  Gold: $1812.9, +1.44%  10-year Treasury yield closed 1.173%, compared with 1.236% on Friday.  Meme stock rotation    Over the past month, popular “meme stocks” have sold off as bitcoin rallied. This inverse relationship was noted in The Daily Shot newsletter a few months ago, and indicates a pattern of buying and selling across high yielding traditional and crypto markets.      It is possible that traders will flock to meme stocks if bitcoin pulls back from overbought levels.    Bitcoin call buying    The bitcoin options market has been heavily skewed towards call buying over the past month, which could signal the return of bullish sentiment.      ""Now that the large spot price sell-off already occurred in May, there aren't as many gains to be protected via put buying,” wrote Gregoire Magadini, co-founder and CEO of Genesis Volatility, in a Telegram chat.      “Combine the lower spot prices with lingering high-ish implied volatility, and bitcoin puts start to look very unattractive,” Magadini wrote. “It makes more sense to buy the dip with call structures than to position oneself using puts.”      The chart below shows the bitcoin put/call ratio at the lowest level since January, which preceded a brief 25% pullback in the bitcoin spot price.    Crypto fund outflows continue    Digital-asset investment products had their fourth straight week of net outflows, even as cryptocurrency markets staged their biggest rally since early this year.      Net outflows across all digital-asset funds totaled $19.5 million, according to a report Monday by CoinShares.      Bitcoin-focused funds had outflows totaling $19.7 million, partly offset by net inflows to funds focused on other categories, including multi-asset funds, wrote CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma.    July crypto comeback    Cryptocurrencies rebounded in July after a sluggish May and June. AAVE, an open-source and non-custodial protocol that runs on the Ethereum blockchain, outperformed major crypto currencies with a 33% gain in July. Bitcoin was not far behind with a 20% gain compared to a 12% gain in ether.    Ether developments    Ether looks to extend its record daily winning streak in the run-up to a planned upgrade on Ethereum’s blockchain that could significantly reduce the cryptocurrency’s supply growth.      Aside from bitcoin’s price recovery from $30,000, ether may have received a boost from Ethereum’s upcoming 11th backward-incompatible upgrade, or hard fork, slated to happen on Aug. 4, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.      The so-called London hard fork contains four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP), of which EIP-1559 will activate a mechanism that would burn a portion of fees paid to miners. Once it takes effect, increased network usage will result in a higher amount of ETH being burned, thereby curbing the cryptocurrency’s supply growth over time.      Meanwhile, 27 of 40, or 68%, of crypto experts surveyed by Finder believe that ether will one day overtake bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap; 58% of the panelists believe that the “flippening” could happen within the next five years.      The price of ether is expected to reach $4,596 per ETH by the end of this year, according to the average forecast from 27 experts on Finder's panel who gave their price predictions.

42387403,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBtDxR,1627933696,'Preying on Human Weakness': Why Investors Are Nervous About Robinhood,"Robinhood Markets' initial public offering has been a mixed bag so far. The stock crashed hard after its debut last Thursday, losing 8.4% within hours of listing – the worst performance ever for an IPO of its size. The Financial Times identified concerns about regulation and the fragility of the pandemic day-trading frenzy as headwinds for the stock.      That may have been a transitory swoon, though: The stock bounced back Friday, and Cathie Wood’s Ark, a clear leader of the growth-investing pack, has been buying. As I’ve written here before, I find Robinhood long-term compelling as an investment, given a broad and continuing rise in mainstream investing, speculation and “meme stocks.”    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    That it looks like a good business, though, doesn’t mean it’s good for society. Critics, including Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, have accused Robinhood of being in essence a form of legalized gambling. Galloway wrote last week that “the company preys on human weakness, in particular young men’s susceptibility to gambling addiction.” The critique is based on Robinhood’s dependence on active trading for revenue, even if that isn’t a good investing strategy overall; and its history of using gamification to keep users hooked.      Part of the risk of a $HOOD position is that regulators will eventually reach the same conclusion and impose restrictions on the business, just as they have with gambling proper. To get a better sense of how regulators might scrutinize Robinhood, then, it’s worth looking directly at the logic behind gambling regulation.    Freedom isn’t free (especially if you’re unlucky)    “Gambling” through Robinhood is legal, of course, because underneath it are stocks instead of a roulette wheel. But to take a step back, why does Galloway regard gambling as such to be a problem? Gambling is, after all, legal in many forms in about 20 U.S. states, and 45 states have official lotteries. For the vast majority of people, games like poker, roulette and slot machines are just good fun, and gambling for money has been part of human society for thousands of years. Most gamblers set budgets, and in investing parlance, bet only what they can afford to lose.    Read more: How $33B Robinhood Ended Up Being Worth Less Than Coinbase | David Z Morris    But the decision to legalize gambling is often a painstaking attempt to balance added revenue and personal freedom with some serious and well-known harms. Gambling has addictive properties, and a small portion of gamblers develop “problem gambling” behaviors comparable to drug or other addictions. The North American Foundation for Gambling Addiction estimates that about 2.6% of the U.S. population – nearly 9 million people – have experienced life harm related to gambling behavior. (One reason lotteries are more widespread is they may contribute less to problem gambling behaviors, while capturing revenue for the public sector.)      Those behaviors don’t just harm the problem gamblers themselves. Much like drug addicts, problem gamblers are more prone to behaviors like theft, fraud, domestic violence and unmanageable debt. A 1996 study found that an average problem gambler cost their employer $1,300 per month in lost labor (in 1996 dollars).      Overall, the same study concluded that the costs of problem-gambling in lost productivity, bad debt, criminal justice proceedings and the like totaled $307 million annually for the state of Wisconsin, its area of focus. That amounted to 42% of the revenue generated by gambling operations, leaving just $188 million in annual net benefit to the state after gambling legalization measures.      But neither the costs nor the benefits are evenly distributed. Not surprisingly, the 2.6% of gamblers who have a problem generate a disproportionate amount of gambling revenue – between 5% and 15% of casino, lottery and sports betting revenue, according to research conducted by the University of Chicago. That means a large portion of casino and gambling profits are extracted from individuals who aren't making careful decisions about their risk.      Similar tradeoffs are also true of cryptocurrency. A relative lack of regulation has created both huge new innovations and opportunities for the most savvy investors, and a high level of fraud or bad ideas that are more likely to harm novices. Legislators worldwide are clearly still searching for what they think is the right regulatory balance of risk and benefit.    Fixing market failure    So while gambling may be a net positive for business and society, those least able to control its addictive impacts bear a huge negative burden. And though we’re years away from definitive research, there is every reason to assume that Robinhood’s revenue also relies on the high-risk behavior of a few users.      This is to some extent inherent to day trading, which produces the same sudden, unpredictable jolts of pleasure that make gambling addictive. Robinhood generates more than half of its revenue from options trading, arguably the riskiest offering on the platform. The company has also tried to encourage heavy users through “gamification,” including dropping virtual confetti with a stock purchase and representing stocks as lottery-like scratch-offs. Robinhood removed some game-like features, including the confetti, in March, after Massachusetts regulators late last year filed a complaint targeting in part the app’s “use of gamification strategies to manipulate customers."" Both are designed to keep players playing, and seem likely to have the greatest impact on those users most susceptible to problem behaviors already.      It’s also worrying that 43% of Robinhood users according to a data analysis of about 5,000 users by the fintech company Stilt. Credit scores below 670 are considered ""fair"" or ""poor"" by reporting agencies, suggesting Robinhood users are either already bad at managing risk or don’t have much disposable income they can afford to lose. Evidence of impacts here is still anecdotal, but it’s not hard to find stories online of novice traders losing all their money on Robinhood.      [Following publication of this piece, Robinhood disputed Stilt’s conclusions, describing the 43% number as “false.” The company sent CoinDesk the following statement: “According to data from Experian based on a sampling of approximately two million Funded Accounts in November 2020, approximately 65% of our customers with Funded Accounts have credit scores of prime or higher, and over 65% have debt to income ratios under 20%.” Prime credit is a classification used by financial institutions and refers to a score of roughly 660 or above. So according to Robinhood’s data, about 35% of its users have scores below 660 – substantially better than what Stilt found.”]      Evidence of impacts here is still anecdotal, but it’s not hard to find stories online of novice traders losing all their money on Robinhood. That suggests that the social costs of Robinhood, like those caused by gambling, aren’t fully captured in the direct costs to users – what economists call a ""negative externality."" Another classic example is pollution, because the price of something like a car doesn’t naturally capture the harms of dumping its by-products into the atmosphere (this is also an example of the tragedy of the commons). There are also ""positive externalities"" – education, for instance, produces social benefits well beyond what accrues to the user directly, meaning education will be underproduced in a pure laissez-faire market.    Read more: A Gamble Inside a Gamble: Robinhood’s Wild Memestock IPO | David Z. Morris    Crucially, Robinhood may also have its own positive externalities. The trading app really does seem to have “democratized finance,” attracting a younger and more diverse customer base than traditional brokerages thanks to its marketing and lower barriers to entry. That’s a benefit to society more broadly through both expanded wealth creation and, more narrowly, because it helps drive more accurate price discovery of stocks. (Yes, that may sound like an insane thing to claim in the wake of huge social bubbles in $GME and $AMC, but in the long run, it’s inevitably true.)      Markets are generally a very good technology for price discovery – it’s what they’re for! – but they’re not perfect, and modern governments generally see it as their role to correct market failure. The U.S. and other governments have almost uniformly stepped in to correct the market’s inability to price pollution, for instance, and to support the production of education.      The novelty of Robinhood’s offering means that legislators will take some time to evaluate its social benefits and risks. But enough stories of users getting wiped out could lead to restrictions. They wouldn’t simply parallel gambling rules, which have generally been based mainly on geographic restrictions.      Instead, Robinhood could find itself restrained by limits on gamification, or higher educational or credentialing requirements for accessing certain products. Much like the rising tide of restrictions on cryptocurrency, that could prevent some harm as well as some amount of good. Whether regulators get that balance right or not, such measures would certainly restrict Robinhood’s revenue, and that worry may hang over the stock for years to come.      UPDATE 8/4/2021, 19:15 UTC: This story has been updated to reflect that Robinhood removed the “confetti” interaction in March 2021.      This piece has also been updated with a statement from Robinhood about its customers’ credit scores.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,David Z.

42387408,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBtE3j,1627931295,What Does Last Week's Steep Drop in Bitcoin's Balance on Exchanges Really Mean?,"The amount of bitcoin being held across all exchanges fell sharply last week, a sign that based on past experience was taken a positive for the bitcoin market.      But the changing dynamics of the market show that as the crypto market grows bigger, relying on just one or two metrics can’t always reveal the full story of what’s going on.      Data from blockchain data firm Glassnode shows that the balance of bitcoin on all exchanges fell 4.1% to 2.48 million from 2.587 million in the last four days of July.      The market’s initial reaction to the drop was positive, because as recently as last September, a decrease in the number of bitcoin held on all exchanges came at the same time as a price rally.      The presumed logic is simple: More BTC was moved off exchanges, potentially to cold storage wallets, as investors became more bullish about the long-term value of their bitcoin holdings.      But after analysts took a closer look at the data, particularly given that the recent drop was much steeper than the previous one, they said that the decline may not necessarily reflect just bullish sentiment.      It is “really hard to know what’s happening with just one dimension,” Willy Woo, an independent blockchain data analyst, told CoinDesk. “As the network changes, the measuring stick does along with it.”      Indeed, just as the market started noticing the drop, crypto exchange Kraken, for example, announced last week that the bitcoin balance drop on its exchange was the result of its internal transfers, which immediately damped some of the initial excitement.      “We can’t confirm that the drop is not entirely due to exchanges’ internal transfers,” Philip Gradwell, chief economist at blockchain data firm Chainalysis, said. “Some are, but not all, and potential withdrawals need to be observed for longer to see if they are genuine withdrawals.      “This makes giving definitive statements on exchange balances far back in the past pretty tricky,” he concluded. “We are working on an improvement to understanding this.”      Clara Medalie, research lead at blockchain data firm Kaiko, said that while it is easy to tell which addresses belong to an exchange, many more entities such as over-the-counter (OTC) desks and brokers associated with the exchanges are receiving lots of bitcoin.      “Thus, it is difficult to actually measure an exchange outflow because these transfers very well could just be being sent to other exchanges or trading desks, or simply between addresses on the same exchange,” Medalie said.    Bullish, but conservatively bullish    Some argue, however, that by also looking at a few other blockchain data metrics, last week’s drop in bitcoin’s balance on exchanges might still reflect a bullish market sentiment by large.      Woo told CoinDesk that when the drop took place last week, the holdings of the cohorts owning small, medium and large amounts of bitcoin increased, showing some aggressive purchases by both bitcoin whales (large holders) and smaller investors.      As CoinDesk reported, the actual number of BTC available for trading is much lower than bitcoin’s current supply at 18.77 million, or 89% of the 21 million cap, because of increased hoarding by investors and the permanent loss of mined BTC over the years. A decline on BTC’s balance on exchanges and increased BTC balances of holders across their wallet addresses indicate that some of the coins were sold to buyers off the exchanges.      “The largest of the whales may be exchanges that were previously thought of as distinct separate entities, when now we discover in effect they were exchanges all along,” Woo said. “‘Shrimps (bitcoin holders with less than one BTC) to smaller whales all increased their holdings … These guys are unlikely to be exchanges, so it validates most of the coins that left exchanges are real.”      As data from Glassnode shows, in the past two weeks, the total circulating supply held by entities with different amounts of BTC all increased, with the exception of entities with balances between 100 and 1,000 BTC, and those with balances of more than 100,000 BTC.      “When I see big outflows like this, I think that traders ‘like the price’ and are willing to hold over a longer time period,” George Kaloudis, research associate at CoinDesk, said. “It certainly shows that investors are more willing to weather the storm in the near-term given the friction of moving funds back on exchanges to liquidate.”    Changes in preferred exchanges    The outflows of bitcoin balance on exchanges, based on analysis by Chainalysis, is also a case-by-case situation, an indication that some investors and traders may have changed their preferred platforms for trading and other crypto activities.      As the chart below shows, the drop in the number of bitcoin held on crypto-to-crypto exchanges was much steeper than the drop in bitcoin balances on crypto-to-fiat exchanges since May 1.      “I think much of the bitcoin that has been withdrawn is moving exchanges, as people change which exchanges they trade on,” Gradwell said.      Even though it is not clear what has triggered the change of preferred crypto exchanges by traders and investors, Binance, the most popular crypto exchange by trading volume, has faced tougher regulatory actions in countries around the world.      Bitcoin's recent outflows from exchanges ""was presumably catalyzed by Binance's announcement of dramatically lower withdrawal limits for non-KYC (know-your-customer) customers,"" blockchain research firm Delphi Digital wrote in its daily market update on July 29, which also noted that Binance and Coinbase were the top two exchanges in terms of absolute outflows.      Binance also said that its users in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands won't be able to open new futures and derivative positions on the platform.      On the other hand, the shift in preference for crypto-to-fiat exchanges also could signal that new investors in crypto are more comfortable with bitcoin investments only, according to CoinDesk’s Kaloudis.      “We are seeing new entrants to the bitcoin market who are presumably less comfortable trading across cryptos in general, [which is] theoretically more bullish for bitcoin adoption,” he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/02/what-does-last-weeks-steep-drop-in-bitcoins-balance-on-exchanges-really-mean,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91c386e52ffd8144d079dbdfd3d0152d63c1e26e-713x490.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Maley is a chief market strategist at Tabak and Co., and during the call with MarketWatch, the strategist has talked about Bitcoin and Ethereum.

One Republican reckons someone in the Biden Administration must have put his colleague up to the task.      Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) speculated Monday that Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) proposed the sweeping bill on digital assets at the request of the Treasury Department.      “Don Beyer hasn’t been involved in this space at all that I know of,” said Emmer during an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover,"" “and all of a sudden he comes out with this proposal that will give the [Federal Reserve] complete control over creating central bank digital currency with all kinds of related authority to it.”      “Call me suspicious if you want, but I think that sometimes someone at Janet Yellen’s Treasury would call a long-time ally like Don Beyer and say, ‘Look, we really need to push back on these Republicans,’” said Emmer, a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.      Emmer’s comments echoed those of fellow Republican congressman, Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), but on a different bill. Davidson claimed in a Bitcoin Magazine interview that the Treasury Department had a hand in the crypto-related language found in the $1 trillion, bipartisan infrastructure bill winding through the U.S. Congress.      Read more: New Crypto Bill in US Congress Is the Most Comprehensive Yet      Beyer, chairman of Congress’ Joint Economic Committee and a member of the tax policy-making House Ways and Means Committee, introduced his bill Thursday just as Congress was weighing the infrastructure deal cobbled together between a group of Democratic and Republican senators. Critics of that proposal, which looks to gain roughly $28 billion in revenue from taxing the cryptocurrency industry, say its definition of what constitutes a crypto “broker” is too wide. Some revisions have been made to narrow that definition but many say it still goes too far.      When asked what revisions on the infrastructure bill he would recommend, Emmer replied that major infrastructure should not be paid for by taxing cryptocurrency as it is not related to the crypto space.      “This is a desperate attempt by a bunch of senators to try and find revenue from any source they can,” Emmer said of the plan.

42387390,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBtDiL,1627929228,"Congress, Don't Rush Regulating Crypto","After months of negotiation, there appears to be bipartisan consensus on an infrastructure bill. A $28 billion surprise for the crypto industry was also tucked into the legislation: The U.S. Congress plans to tax various actors in the crypto financial system to help pay for infrastructure spending. It will do so by classifying these parties as “brokers” under the Internal Revenue Code.      The news hit the crypto industry like a bomb. The new tax classification could force many previously unregulated parties to conduct “know your customer” scrutiny on transacting parties, dramatically transforming the crypto ecosystem. Since the announcement, the entire crypto sector has been frantically trying to get policymakers to change course, and even though I am generally a critic of the crypto sector this time I think they are right. While I reserve comment on the substance of the proposed crypto legislation, the process being used to regulate crypto through an unrelated bill on infrastructure is deeply flawed and risks increasing rather than reducing harms to the public.    Angela Walch is a professor of Law at St. Mary’s University School of Law and a research associate at the Centre for Blockchain Technologies at University College London. She does not own any cryptocurrencies or have any financial interests in the crypto financial system.    On July 27, I testified about the crypto financial system at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing, & Urban Affairs Committee. I explained that the crypto financial system has reached significant scale (in the trillions of dollars and growing), and that due to numerous links that have been built between it and the traditional financial system (such as futures products, investment funds and many others) there is potential for crises in the crypto financial system to spill over into the traditional financial system.      I further testified that mainstream beliefs about basic characteristics of crypto systems are flawed because they are based on idealized views of these systems rather than realistic ones. (To give this a bit more color, if you have heard that crypto systems are immutable, allow the direct transfer of value online without intermediaries and don’t require you to trust anyone because they are decentralized, then you need to look for more realistic sources of information.)      If investors and policymakers make decisions based on misunderstandings of the characteristics of crypto systems, then each decision is flawed and embeds risk. This leaves us with a ticking time bomb at massive scale that – due to many links between the crypto financial system and the traditional financial system – has the potential to impact the public at large, including people who may never have touched a cryptocurrency in their lives.    Read more: How the Proposed Crypto Tax Rules Miss the Mark | David Z. Morris    For all of these reasons, after researching cryptocurrencies since 2013 I believe we can no longer wait to engage in comprehensive, tailored regulation of the crypto financial system, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for in a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on July 26. For over a decade regulators, industry and the courts have been sparring over how the crypto financial system fits into the regulatory structure of the traditional financial system, and it is time to stop trying to cram this square peg into a round hole. Crypto industry players have been complaining for years about a lack of regulatory clarity, and all the while systemic risk has been building as the crypto financial system has exploded in scale and links to the traditional financial system have multiplied.      One may think, therefore, that I would be happy to see the regulation of activities in the crypto financial system included in the infrastructure bill. Unfortunately, that is not the case.      For a number of reasons, I believe that this is the wrong way to go about regulating the crypto financial system.      First, as I explained in my Senate testimony, the crypto financial system is large, complex and intertwined with the traditional financial system. The market cap of cryptocurrencies hit a value of over $2 trillion in April, and that doesn’t include the financial products tied to cryptocurrencies or the companies operating in the crypto financial system. In short, it is now massive, and it’s fair to say that we now have a traditional regulated financial system and a smaller but still sizable, largely unregulated, crypto financial system.      As to complexity, the sociotechnical systems (known as “crypto-economic systems” among academics studying them) on which cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether operate are a complicated blend of software code, cryptography, software developers, miners and validators who add transactions to the blockchain, and users. Each system has its own “crypto-economic” incentive structure built into it, in theory designed to share power among its participants in a stable way.      Further increasing complexity are the products and services that operate on top of base level crypto systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A “decentralized” financial system, known as DeFi, now runs on the Ethereum network, with decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and other mirrors of the traditional financial system. Outside of the systems themselves, parties like crypto exchanges and wallet providers, along with investment funds, so-called “stablecoins,” and financial products that financialize digital assets, fill out this complex web.    Read more: US Stablecoin Regulation Could Lead to Geopolitical Competition | Tanvi Ratna    Regarding linkages to the traditional financial system, the crypto financial system is no longer its own isolated world of enthusiasts. Coinbase, a large crypto exchange, went public earlier this year at a valuation of more than $85 billion. Venture capital funds like Andreessen Horowitz are devoting billions to investments in the crypto financial system. Futures in bitcoin and ether have traded for several years now. Companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy and Square have disclosed that they hold large amounts of cryptocurrencies. A recent survey revealed that seven in 10 institutional investors expect to buy or invest in digital assets in the future, and that more than half of institutional investors in Asia, Europe, and the U.S. currently invest in them. (I could go on.)      Second, given this scale and complexity, along with the numerous linkages to the traditional financial system, regulation of the crypto financial system should be done with great care and deliberation, rather than casually and in haste.      Regulating the crypto financial system now is like trying to fix an airplane in mid-flight – an incredibly challenging task. It is a live, ever-evolving system with multiple interacting parts that regulation could affect in surprising ways through feedback loops and spillover effects into the traditional financial system. These effects can result in real losses of value to millions of people in the U.S. and globally. Making changes to crypto systems through regulation needs to be done with humility and care, not by wildly swinging a hammer, as I fear we would do by rushing crypto regulation into an unrelated infrastructure package.    Regulation should find a balance where Congress does neither too much nor too little.    Getting regulation of the crypto financial system right will require thoughtful consultation with numerous parties, from expert technologists doing bleeding-edge work on crypto-economic systems, to academics from multiple fields, industry players, and experts on how the crypto financial system is the same as and different from the traditional financial system. The consultation should bring together a diversity of perspectives, including those who believe crypto is a wholly positive innovation, those who have serious concerns about its value and the risks it poses and those who fall somewhere in the middle.      A vital part of this consultation will be fact-finding to ensure thorough and accurate understanding of the technological and human systems within the crypto financial system. Though policymakers have ostensibly been fact-finding on crypto for years now, as I argued in my testimony, mainstream understanding of crypto systems is shallow and deeply flawed. Only with such an exhaustive process can the resulting regulation triangulate on the best, most nuanced outcome. Rushing partial regulation of the sector into an unrelated infrastructure bill short-circuits that essential process.      Regulation should find a balance where Congress does neither too much nor too little, where it fosters the good and tempers the bad, where systemic resilience and stability are enhanced, and where potential harms to the public are minimized. Clearly, this “Goldilocks” nirvana is a tall order that we can hope to achieve only through humility, open-mindedness, solicitation of deep and broad expertise, discussion, and debate, all of which require at least a modicum of time.      Further, we cannot forget that the crypto financial system is inherently global, seamlessly reaching across national borders. U.S. policymakers can expect to make a massive difference by regulating the crypto financial system domestically, but this doesn’t make the risks posed by crypto go away elsewhere. Regulation will likely require cross-border regulatory cooperation like we have seen with the Financial Action Task Force for policing global money laundering and terrorist financing or the Basel Accords for global banking. Rushing partial regulation of the crypto financial system into an infrastructure package risks cutting short a coordinated international response to an international problem.      I appreciate the pressure that policymakers must feel to address the systemic risks from the crypto financial system. But just because policymakers and regulators have allowed it to grow to its present state largely unchecked, does not mean that rapid-fire, piecemeal regulation is the best way to address the situation. The crypto financial system has become a many-headed hydra, and taming this hydra will require thoughtful planning, strategizing and public debate rather than a shotgun approach bolted on as an afterthought to unrelated legislation.      The stakes here are high and the regulatory approach must be sound. I urge Congress to strike the crypto regulatory measures from the infrastructure legislation and to give regulation of the crypto financial system the time and attention it so urgently demands.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Angela Walch,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/02/congress-dont-rush-regulating-crypto,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42387398,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBtDr9,1627928679,The Node: The First Step to Making Sense of the Token Economy,"Let me tell you about the biggest ah-ha moment I ever had covering crypto. It's maybe the ah-ha moment that has kept making everything else make sense from that day forward.      The insight answered this question: How did digital tokens create a new and different way to make it worthwhile for teams to devote years to building some online product?    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    If you weren't there for the initial coin offering era, here's an oversimplification: Folks were raising money to build services that would be open source and charge no platform fees to their users. They did this by selling tokens, which weren't stock in the company but typically some kind of access enabler for some part of the new service.      There are a lot of forms tokens take, but here's the simplest: Most of these ICO startups created some kind of marketplace, enabling a connection between people who needed a service and those who could provide it. While the marketplace itself didn't charge fees, it would enable transactions only with the native token.      The ICO era may have passed, but what clicked for me then is still relevant now.      Take that initial idea and add complexity and innovation and that gives you the plethora of companies created in this vein up through today. In truth, basically no one uses the model above, but the idea started there.      So this part about not charging fees for building these marketplaces kept bugging me. How would the creators make money?      I think it clicked while I was talking to a founder making a decentralized auction site, like eBay. The big selling point was that the protocol would allow folks to host all these items for sale and it wouldn't charge anyone any money for them to host the listing or for the protocol to manage bids on it.    Read more: Why the World Still Needs Uncensorable Marketplaces | Marc Hochstein    Obviously, this is a very nice deal for users, but how the heck did it make sense for this team to spend a lot of time and money to build it?      That was what was so clever about the ICO model, though. It created an incentive to build something valuable that the creators could eventually walk away from and let run itself. The way it did it hit me that day, so let me help you see it, too.      Once this insight slips into place, it's fairly easy to make other token projects make sense from here.    EthBay    Let's imagine a simple decentralized eBay. Let's call it EthBay.      On EthBay, to host a sale, sellers would need to hold a certain amount of EthBay tokens. They wouldn't need to pay to sell, but they would need to buy that token and prove it to EthBay for as long as they wanted to run listings. Once they were done selling, the merchants would be free to unstake and sell their tokens.      Most projects quickly walked away from the idea of the token as the transaction medium of their protocols because it created too much friction for users, but requiring businesses running on one to stake some token could be used to protect users, because bad operators could lose their stake.      So the staking requirement creates demand for the token, and it slows what's called ""token velocity"" – the speed at which a token gets sold after a new person attains it. (Note: Slower token velocity should increase price so long as there is demand.)      Obviously, more listings would require more tokens, and eventually other services would get built on top of EthBay that would also require tokens to operate (such as arbitration services).      The pure idea of an ICO was this: A team would create some finite supply of token that made sense for them, set aside a portion to use to attract early adopters with giveaways and promotions, set aside a portion for the team and investors and set aside a portion to sell to the public.      The sale to the public would serve as their operational funds to get off the ground. Then, if they built it and the people came, the token value would start going up.      So here's the insight:      It was that rising value in token value that would, in theory, pay for all the hard work of the founders and the team. If they built a good product, the tokens they had set aside for themselves would go from, say, 10 cents in the ICO to $1 by the time the team was ready to wrap.      But only if the finished product created a marketplace that users wanted to use.    Just the beginning    Tokens were a nascent concept when this clicked for me. Folks didn't know whether to think of them as arcade tokens or receipts or insurance or licenses. The truth is they are all those things and more now.      Still, whenever a new project doesn't quite make sense to me in cryptocurrency, I try to picture where the token sits in its particular concept, how the creators envision value going to that token and how they can see that token making their work as builders worthwhile.      Looking at new projects through that frame, I have found, can make them much less baffling.

42411918,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh56w,1627927735,What Is Cryptography?,"Cryptography puts the “crypto” in cryptocurrency. It has existed much longer than our digital age and has evolved like languages over the centuries.  Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into a form that only intended recipients can process and read. Its first known use dates back to the year 1900 BC as hieroglyphics in an Egyptian tomb. The term itself comes from the Greek words kryptos and graphein, which mean hidden and to write, respectively.  One of the most famous uses was developed by Julius Caesar around 40 BC and was aptly named Caesar’s cipher. A cipher uses a secret piece of information that tells you how to scramble and therefore unscramble a message. Caesar used a substitution cipher, where each letter of the alphabet was replaced by a letter in a different fixed position further up or down in the alphabet. For example, the alphabet could be moved five places to the right meaning the letter ""A"" would now be ""F"", ""B"" would now be ""G"" and so on. That meant he could pass along messages without fear of them being intercepted, because only his officers knew how to unscramble the message.  Read More: What Is Cryptocurrency?  Giovan Battista Bellaso, a 16th-century cryptologist, designed the Vigenere cipher (falsely attributed to diplomat Blaise de Vigenere), believed to be the first cipher that used an encryption key. The alphabet was written across 26 rows, with each row shifting a letter to create a grid. The encryption key was written out to match the length of the message. Then, the grid was used to encrypt the message, letter by letter. Finally, the sender shared the encrypted message and the secret keyword to the recipient, who would possess the same grid.  Then along came computers, which enabled much more sophisticated cryptography. But the goal remains the same: to transfer a readable message (plain text) into something an unintended reader cannot understand (cipher text). The process is known as encryption and is how information can be shared across public internet connections. The knowledge about how to decrypt – or unscramble – the data is known as the key and only intended parties should have access to this information.  How does cryptography work?  There are many ways in which to encrypt information, and the levels of complexity depend on the degree of protection the data may require. But we commonly see three types of cryptographic algorithms.  Symmetric encryption  Symmetric encryption – or secret-key encryption – relies on a single key. This means that the sender and receiver of data both share the same key, which is then used both to encrypt and decrypt the information.  To do that, the secret key needs to be agreed upon ahead of time. While still a good source of encryption, the fact that there is only a single key protecting the information means there is some risk when sending it over insecure connections. Just imagine you want to share your front door key with a friend by hiding it under your doormat. Your friend now has access to your house. But there is also a chance a stranger could find the key and enter without your permission.  Asymmetric encryption  Asymmetric encryption – or public-key encryption – uses a pair of keys. This added level of security instantly increases the protection of the data. In this case, each key serves a single purpose. There is a public key that can be exchanged with anybody, over any network. This key has the information on how to encrypt the data and anyone can use it. But there is also a private key. The private key is not shared and holds the information about how to decrypt the message. Both keys are generated by an algorithm that uses large prime numbers to create two unique, mathematically linked keys. Anyone with access to the public key can use it to encrypt a message, but only the private key holder can decipher the message.  It works almost like a mailbox. Anyone can put a message into the deposit slot. But only the owner of the mailbox has the key to open it and read the messages. This is the foundation for most cryptocurrency transactions.  Read More: Why Use Bitcoin?  Hash functions  Hash functions are another way cryptography can secure information. But instead of using keys, it relies on algorithms to turn any data input into a fixed-length string of characters.  Hash functions also differ from other forms of encryption because they only work one way, meaning you cannot turn a hash back into its original data.  Hashes are essential to blockchain management because they can encrypt large quantities of information without compromising the original data. Having an organized way to structure data not only increases efficiency, but hashes can also act like digital fingerprints for any data that’s been encrypted. This can then be used to verify and secure against any unauthorized modifications during transport through networks. Any changes to the original data would result in a new hash, which would no longer match the original source and therefore would not be verifiable on the blockchain.  Digital Signatures  A digital signature is another key aspect of ensuring the security, authenticity and integrity of data in a message, software or digital document. As their name suggests, they act similarly to physical signatures and are a unique way to bind your identity to data and therefore act as a way to verify the information. But rather than having a unique character to represent your identity like with physical signatures, digital signatures are based on public-key cryptography. The digital signature comes as code, which is then attached to the data thanks to the two mutually authenticating keys. The sender creates the digital signature by using a private key to encrypt the signature-related data, with the receiver getting the signer’s public key to decrypt the data. This code acts as proof that a message was created by the sender and that it has not been tampered with while being transferred, and it ensures that the sender cannot deny they sent the message.  If the recipient is unable to decrypt and read the signed document with the provided public key, it shows there was an issue with the document or signature, and so the document cannot be authenticated.  Read More: How to Store Your Bitcoin  What is cryptography used for in cryptocurrencies?  A large draw of cryptocurrencies is their security and transparency on the blockchain. All of that relies on cryptographic mechanisms. That is how most blockchain-based cryptocurrencies maintain security, and therefore it constitutes the very nature of cryptocurrencies.  It was on a cryptography message board back in 2009 that Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto suggested a way to solve the double-spend problem that had long been the Achilles heel of digital currencies. The double-spend problem occurs when the same unit of crypto has the potential to be spent twice, which would destroy trust in them as an online payment solution and make them essentially worthless.  Nakamoto proposed using a peer-to-peer distributed ledger that was timestamped and secured by cryptographic means. That led to the creation of the blockchain as we know it today. As with all technology, cryptography will evolve to keep up with the demands for a secure digital environment. This is especially true with the growing adoption of blockchains and cryptocurrencies across industries and borders.  Further reading on blockchain technology  What Is Blockchain Technology?  Blockchain technology eliminates the need for a trusted party to facilitate digital relationships and is the backbone of cryptocurrencies.  What is a Distributed Ledger?

42387407,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBtE2T,1627922462,Ether Prints Record Winning Streak as London Hard Fork Looms,"Ether looks to extend its record daily winning streak in the runup to a planned upgrade on Ethereum's blockchain that could significantly reduce the cryptocurrency's supply growth.      The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading 1.6% higher on the day near $2,600 at press time, having rallied 43% over an unbroken string of 12 straight daily price gains, according to Coinbase data.      ""Ether has notched a 12-day winning streak, the longest ever,"" blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock tweeted early today, citing $2,598 and $2,753 as key resistance levels on the path toward $3,000.      Aside from bitcoin's price recovery from $30,000, ether may have received a boost from Ethereum's upcoming 11th backward-incompatible upgrade, or hard fork, slated to happen on Aug. 4.      The so-called London hard fork contains four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP), of which EIP-1559 will activate a mechanism that would burn a portion of fees paid to miners. Once it takes effect, increased network usage will result in a higher amount of ETH being burned, thereby curbing the cryptocurrency's supply growth over time.      The upgrade may bring ether a store-of-value or deflationary-asset appeal in the eyes of some investors – a narrative so far largely focused on bitcoin. The top cryptocurrency's supply is capped at 21 million, and its per-block issuance is reduced by 50% every four years.      Under simulations run by Dune Analytics, the upgrade would have burned more than 2.9 million coins in 365 days if implemented a year ago, amounting to over 70% net reduction in supply growth.      ""The highly anticipated Ethereum London hard fork event will expose users to a more flexible and cheaper fee structure and introduce a mild burn effect, billed to make ether deflationary,"" Greg Waisman, co-founder and COO at the global payment network Mercuryo, said. ""The coin has trailed an uptrend from the weekend, and we may see this brewing positive sentiment over the coin shoot its price to $3,000 in the coming days/weeks following the update.""      Options data shows investors are positioning for continued gains. Both long-term and short-term put-call skews are flashing negative values for the first time in nearly three months. That's a sign of greater demand for calls or bullish bets relative to puts.      One-week, one-, three- and six-month put-call skews hover below zero, an across-the-board bullish market positioning last observed in early May.

42387409,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBtE4z,1627901103,Bitcoin Logs Biggest Weekly Price Gain in 3 Months as Illiquid Supply Hits Record High,"Bitcoin posted its steepest weekly gain in three months last week, and blockchain data hinting at renewed supply-side weakness indicates further advances may be in the offing.      The top cryptocurrency by market cap added 12.4% in the seven days through Aug. 1, the most since the final week of April, according to Bitstamp data. It advanced 18.4% in July, snapping a three-month losing streak, and was last changing hands near $40,000.      Data tracked by Glassnode show bitcoin's illiquid supply, or the balance held by illiquid entities, decoupled from prices in May, signaling renewed holding sentiment. The measure reached a record high 14.447 million over the weekend.      ""Amount of bitcoin held by the strongest holders has retraced the whole dump and surged to [all-time high]. This is very bullish,"" Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer at Moskovski Capital, tweeted.      The figures show investors are again holding for the long term, or HODLing, reducing the supply of coins available for sale in the market.      Bitcoin supply currently is 18.77 million, or 89% of the 21 million cap. However, according to Glassnode, the actual number of coins available for trading is much lower due to increased hoarding by investors and permanent loss of mined BTC over the years.      While bitcoin moved in tandem with illiquid supply from October 2020 to May 2021, it diverged in mid-May. As the chart shows, the link may now be reestablishing. A similar split occurred for several weeks before bitcoin began its meteoric rise from $10,000 in October 2020. If the illiquid supply continues to rise, a supply-side crisis may emerge, and last price year's surge may be repeated.      Other blockchain indicators also signal an impending supply squeeze, as tweeted by analysts Willy Woo and Will Clemente.      From a technical analysis perspective, the bull case would strengthen once bitcoin establishes a foothold above a three-month descending trendline.      The trendline hurdle is $42,464 at press time. That's also the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from April's high to May's low.

42387405,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBtDzx,1627884187,Bitcoin Price Slumps 5% as Recent Rally Begins to Cool,"The run-up in bitcoin's price witnessed during the final days of July is facing pressure from sellers looking to cash in their profit amid tensions over a proposed U.S. infrastructure bill's language.      The pullback from Saturday's top of around $42,400 to current prices of around $39,500 is likely associated with uncertainty surrounding the bill, according to Daniel Kim, head of capital markets at Australia-based decentralized lending company Maple Finance.      An earlier version of the bill sought to increase information reporting requirements and a broadening of the definition of a “broker” for any parties that might interact with crypto, including decentralized exchanges.      ""This ultimately created a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt with users moving funds off platforms, reducing liquidity, and uncertainty of price with this impact,"" Kim said in relation to the bill's proposal on Thursday.      Crypto exchange FTX's bitcoin reserve almost doubled in July while Binance’s reserve dropped by 70,000, and this has left a lot of uncertainty in the market, Kim added.      Bitcoin had been mounting a significant push toward resistances near $42,000 and cemented a 10-day winning streak, the crypto's longest in eight years, on Sunday.      The rally came to an end later in the evening and has fallen 5.5% over the last 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows.      The bill, which is being debated in the Senate, seeks to bolster tax receipts in order to fund the more than $1 trillion in infrastructure improvements across the country, $28 billion of which would come by way of crypto transactions.      Criticism over the bill's definitions as it relates to the crypto community has been vocal with some suggesting the bill is too broad and could apply to most economic activity in the U.S. crypto industry.      An updated version of the Senate’s bipartisan infrastructure bill, revealed Sunday evening, seeks to narrow the definition of “broker” to people who provide digital asset transfers.      The bill's revised language does not explicitly include decentralized exchanges, nor does it explicitly exclude miners, node operators, software developers, or similar parties.

42407060,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf99S3,1627873643,Updated US Infrastructure Bill Narrows Crypto Reporting Requirement,"An updated version of the U.S. Senate’s bipartisan infrastructure bill narrows the definition of “broker” for the purposes of crypto tax collection but stops short of specifying that only companies that provide services for customers qualify.      The bill, which is being debated by the Senate, funds around $1 trillion in infrastructure improvements across the country, and would be paid for in part by about $28 billion in taxes generated from crypto transactions. An earlier version of the bill sought to do this by boosting information reporting requirements and broadening the definition of a “broker” for tax purposes to include any parties that might interact with crypto, including decentralized exchanges or other non-custodial service providers.      An updated version of the bill now specifies that only people who provide digital asset transfers would be treated as a broker, according to a copy of the draft bill obtained by CoinDesk and later posted online. In other words, the language now does not explicitly include decentralized exchanges, but it also doesn’t explicitly exclude miners, node operators, software developers or similar parties.      “Any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person” is now included in the definition, according to the bill.      Where an earlier draft also said the bill provided for an ""expansion"" of the definition of the term ""broker,"" the current version provides for a ""clarification"" of the term.      At the heart of the issue is information reporting requirements. The initial version of the infrastructure bill did not propose new taxes on crypto transactions, but rather, proposed increasing the type of reporting that exchanges or other market participants must provide around transactions.      This means the bill would enforce existing tax rules on a broader set of transactions. It could be difficult for some types of exchanges – namely, decentralized exchanges – to comply, given there’s no clear operators that can provide this type of reporting.      Under the previous language of the infrastructure bill, other parties might also have gotten swept up in these rules, such as software developers, hardware manufacturers or miners who don’t send transactions to customers directly. However, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), one of the lawmakers working on the bipartisan bill and the lawmaker who may have drafted the language, does not intend to capture these types of entities. A spokesperson told CoinDesk that “non-brokers” would not have to comply with reporting requirements.      “This legislative language does not redefine digital assets or cryptocurrency as a ‘security’ for tax purposes, impugn on the privacy of individual crypto holders, or force non-brokers, such as software developers and crypto miners, to comply with [Internal Revenue Service] reporting obligations. It simply clarifies that any person or entity acting as a broker by facilitating trades for clients and receiving cash, must comply with a standard information reporting obligation,” spokesperson Drew Nirenberg told CoinDesk.      When asked if the senator intended to publish this statement in the Congressional Record, another spokesperson said the statement was only for press purposes.      Clarifying intent in legislative history is one way Portman or other lawmakers could specify that DEXs, miners and similar groups would not be defined as brokers. Now that the bill is introduced, other Senators can also offer amendments to modify or strike the provision.      UPDATE (August 2, 2021, 03:20 UTC): Adds that the bill was posted to the Senate's website.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/02/updated-us-infrastructure-bill-narrows-crypto-reporting-requirement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5533dbf9aae9cfd35d8ea339500e3c77dbbbb88-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
