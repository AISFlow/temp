42425390,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTJh,1391631149,Kazakhstan Central Bank Could Ban Bitcoin to Protect Bankers,"Kazakhstan's Central Bank Governor, Kairat Kelimbetov, has indicated in public comments that the National Bank of Kazakhstan could move to classify bitcoin as a ponzi scheme this year.  The remarks were issued on 4th February at a press conference, according to Tengrinews.kz, an English-language news site based in Kazakhstan.  There, Kelimbetov suggested that the Finance Ministry of Kazakhstan is studying bitcoin, but has yet to determine a formal stance on the virtual currency.  “The issue is rather complicated. Some claim the currency is a good tool of money laundering and an absolute evil. That’s why some monetary authorities, like those in China, have banned bitcoin,"" Kelimbetov said.  Kelimbetov cautioned that a decision on the legal status of bitcoin has not yet been made, but that one was likely to be issued this year.  Protecting the country's banking system  Perhaps more interesting are previous comments made by Kazakhstan's vice minister of finance Ruslan Dalenov this December, who noted that any actions against bitcoin could be a move to protect domestic banks. Dalenov has revealed in previous statements that money laundering is not a concern with bitcoin.  ""There is a cheaper and clearer means - cash. This is where we should start our fight,"" Dalenov said.  Dalenov has also stated that should bitcoin adoption increase, there would not be any work for bankers, suggesting that the move has more to do with job protection in the country than bitcoin's violation of any existing laws.  A regional consensus grows  The announcement notably comes on the heels of similar comments made by the Estonian Central Bank on 31 January, which issued a warning to its citizens that bitcoin may be a ponzi scheme that could put citizens and their wealth at risk.  Like Estonia, Kazakhstan shares a border with Russia. As a result, it may not be surprising that both comments came just days after Russia suggested that its bitcoin users could be breaking the law.  However, as highlighted by yesterday's statements from Kazakhstan, the region is still working out the issues. Some high-level bankers in Russia, for instance, have issued pleas to allow bitcoin innovation to continue.  For more information on the legal status of bitcoin activities in Kazkhstan, click here.

42425409,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTrh,1391626804,Tea Merchant Builds Coinbase Alternative for Litecoin Processing,"When online farm-direct tea marketplace Tealet first contemplated accepting bitcoin, it did so because it perceived there would be an overlap between its customer base and the emerging virtual currency users.  As CEO Elyse Petersen told CoinDesk this October, both the company and bitcoin users are dedicated to ""trying to cut out the middlemen"".  However, Petersen had no idea just how enthusiastic the response would be. In the months since, Tealet has relocated from Hawaii to a new home in Las Vegas. There, it's found itself taking on a role as an ambassador for the cryptocurrency community, both to interested customers as well as other tech startups that want to replicate its success.  Since its 17th September launch, Tealet has seen 45% of its total revenue come from its bitcoin customers, who purchase from its extensive catalogue of loose leaf teas or subscribe to its bi-monthly tea delivery service.  Inspired by these strong sales figures, Petersen and Tealet web developer Cody Moniz began to consider the benefits of adding other virtual currencies, finally selecting litecoin as the payment option that could give its bottom line a boost.  But, after conducting some market research, Petersen came to an important realization, one that would lead her team to go above and beyond what many merchants would hope to achieve:  ""A service like Coinbase is not available for Litecoin, so we had to build our own,"" Petersen said.  Selecting litecoin  Despite her success with bitcoin, Petersen may not have moved so quickly on litecoin if it hadn't been for her friend and fellow MBA student Warren Togami, a lead developer for litecoin who conducts interviews with Charlie Lee, and the passion of Tealet developer Moniz.  Petersen said that though Warren did suggest that she pursue litecoin, she was ultimately swayed by the virtual currency's unique approach to market adoption.  ""We found it interesting that the marketing angle is not to bash bitcoin, but to try and build their brand around bitcoin and encourage bitcoin users just as much as they do litecoin users,"" Petersen said.  Market research  While enthusiastic about the possibility, Petersen was further dismayed by a lack of options that could provide the ""smooth and low-risk transition"" from litecoin to USD Tealet required.  ""We looked around at all the different options, but there was no main processor out there. The merchants that did have something, it was more of a manual process. When you would go through the shopping cart, they would just give you a litecoin address, and they would manually manage the orders as they came in,"" said Petersen.  Such a system, while useful to some merchants, simply wasn't practical for Tealet, which can process upwards of 100 orders a day.  Developing a solution  The completed project was the result of two weeks of effort by Moniz, who Petersen described as a ""cryptocurrency fanatic"" who was happy to put his skills to the test with a big challenge. Warren, in turn, conducted quality control to ensure the project was ready for its launch.  As of 5th February, Tealet shoppers can now add teas to checkout, and before completing the purchase, choose whether to pay with a debit or credit card, bitcoin or litecoin.  Next, a window will appear displaying a QR code along with the amount the customer owes in LTC. Prices will be valid for a 30-minute window. Once customers complete their purchase, Tealet's new system processes the order.  To mark the launch, Tealet buyers will also be able to purchase special litecoin tea boxes, which also come with free litecoin keychains.  A white-label solution  For now, the processor is a work in progress. Petersen said that Tealet still needs to manually move its litecoin earnings from a BTC to USD state. But, she's optimistic such kinks will be ironed out.  ""Theres a little bit of exchange risk we're taking on, but we're just so enthusiastic about accepting litecoin that we're willing to take on that risk now,"" Petersen explains.  Petersen hopes Tealet will soon be able to offer its processor as a white-label solution, though she acknowledges more advanced solutions from competitors could make it obsolete with time. This version of the processor would utilize watch-only wallets to help other merchants accept LTC without worrying about money service business or money transmitter requirements.  The CEO mentioned that she has since learned about market alternatives like GoCoin, which now offer litecoin processing, and is considering making the switch to this service.  ""It's kind of funny, it's like 'You're a payment processing company?' 'How did that happen?'"" Petersen remarked.  Still, her story is proof that despite the rise in popularity of bitcoin and litecoin, market solutions are still limited, and that opportunity abounds for enterprising firms.

42425404,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwThh,1391618920,Charity Boss Suspects Stolen Coins Were Used in 180 BTC Donation,"An old story about bitcoin charities and stolen coins resurfaced this week, with Dmitry Murashchik, Director of Bitcoin100, telling Forbes that he suspects a large donation might have come from a 2013 exchange hack, but he has no way of knowing for sure.  The 180 BTC donation in question took place in January 2013. At that time, the total value was under $3000, but it would be closer to $150,000 at today’s rates.  Murashchik, better known as ‘Rassah’ on the BitcoinTalk forums, has operated Bitcoin100 since 2011 as a means to promote more widespread bitcoin use and demonstrate its effectiveness at fundraising without processing fees or chargebacks.  However, bitcoin’s other selling points, such as relative anonymity and non-refundable nature, could cause headaches for those with good intentions.  Charities often receive funds from stolen credit cards, but those transactions can be reversed – with the charity in question usually having to pay a $20-$100 processing fee for its troubles. A large, anonymous bitcoin donation, though, would be like leaving a bag of cash on a charity’s doorstep after hours.  Untraceable transaction  Even now, Rassah has seen no proof that the donation came from the proceeds of a theft, but can only wonder if it did, since the transaction occurred at around the same time as a few early bitcoin exchanges were hacked and relieved of funds. It's hard to be sure, though:  “That money may have been a generous donation,” Rassah said. “There were wealthy bitcoiners then too, and $2,600 [then 50 to 100 BTC] wasn’t that much higher than many others donated.”  Bitcoin100's procedure, in cases of large, anonymous donations, is to ask someone to come forward and take credit, even if anonymously. However, if someone donates money and doesn’t come forward, he said, there is absolutely no way to find out who they were.  “The most we can do is save a copy of the transaction number and set aside that money for some months, in case someone claims it was stolen.”  Bitcoin100 eventually kept the money in question. The organization has always been transparent about its operations, publishing its vanity address online for anyone to examine on Blockchain.info or similar explorers. Promoting transparency via the public ledger is actually another of Rassah’s motivations for pushing bitcoin charity.  Charities in most countries are legally required to report any suspicious donations. However, with bitcoin not officially recognized as a currency in any country, and having legal status as an asset in only a few places, large scale thefts usually go unpunished, if they are investigated at all.  Promoting bitcoin  According to its homepage, Bitcoin100 “donates the bitcoin equivalent of $1000 to non-political, secular charities that prominently display an option for supporters to contribute via bitcoin on their website.”  Unlike another more recent high-profile entrant into the bitcoin charity sphere, the BitGive Foundation, Bitcoin100 does not convert its donations into local currency before passing them on to recipients. Instead, the organisation encourages them to continue collecting digitally.  In fact, most of its efforts, according to posts on its forum threads, are spent convincing charities or other recipients to accept bitcoin in the first place, often without success.  Rassah is a big believer in bitcoin’s ability to help the poor, both through donations and remittances, which incur often-unreasonable fees of up to 11% when sent through an established money transfer business. This hits senders of small amounts the hardest.  The situation is made even worse because Paypal and credit cards often block access to some countries altogether, and, even if they didn't, those who need money the most often don’t have sufficient cash to open bank accounts.  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, however, largely solve these problems.  Preserving privacy  When asked if he would consider using a block chain or other investigation service to dig into donors’ backgrounds, Rassah was quite adamant that he did not support such services.  Breaking privacy on a massive scale or blacklisting addresses is “highly unethical”, he said, and “doesn’t prevent crime that has already happened, either”. He indicated that he would rather deal with anonymously donated, potentially stolen coins himself, and even pay out of his own pocket if he made the wrong call.

42425407,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTjh,1391614762,Bitcoin Has the Power to Transform Digital Media Forever,"Michael Jackson is a software engineer, entrepreneur and venture capital investor at Mangrove Capital Partners. He is also the former COO of Skype.  It is little wonder that many perceive bitcoin as a commodity rather than a method of exchange.  Extensive media coverage of the digital currency’s price fluctuations has driven enormous speculative interest. While it has enjoyed relative stability over recent weeks, it remains inherently unstable and vulnerable to speculation.  If this can be addressed, however, it may well turn out to be one of the most transformative technologies we’ve seen in recent years. The internet has been lacking a frictionless payment system since its very inception and digital currency could profoundly change the way industries operate. One that stands to benefit the most is the digital media industry.  Painful evolution  We’ve seen a somewhat painful evolution for those industries with products that can be stored and transmitted over the web – with media, music, film and publishing being the most obvious examples.  Even now, the use of paywalls to monetise content is a high friction process. Setting up an account and providing credit card details is both tedious and a significant commitment. On the other hand, the simplicity and ease of paying for apps using a mobile account meant Apple customers spent $10bn on the App Store in 2013 alone.  Digital currency promises to go further for digital media – enabling content owners to incorporate payment intrinsically within their content. For example, publishers could very simply watermark a single article and wrap it in a layer of encryption so it can only be accessed using a bitcoin key.  When a bitcoin holder clicks on the article they want to read, their key automatically unwraps the layer of encryption and a payment is made. By attaching the relevant bitcoin to the article’s watermark, the publisher could also track its usage in order to identify and address any copyright infringement.  The same is true for everyone from bloggers to media conglomerates – and for all kinds of businesses, from social media to online gaming. It could also be used by the music, science and education industries, as well as pretty much every service delivered through the web for that matter.  As well as helping all of these industries and businesses create new value, a widespread virtual currency would also undoubtedly lead to a whole myriad of new applications and services being delivered over the web.  With strengths, come weaknesses  While bitcoin has so much to offer, it does of course have its weaknesses – until it has price stability it is unlikely to be trusted as a medium of exchange, as people want to know that the currency they hold will still be worth the same amount the following day.  Conversely, those with bitcoin will hoard their holdings if they expect its value to keep rising. Reversibility of transactions is also important. However, the existing implementation can be modified and we may well see a second generation of bitcoin-based or bitcoin-inspired digital currencies emerge – one if which may well be adopted more broadly.  [post-quote]  Indeed, 'virtual currencies' are already proven. The international telephone industry itself has used special drawing rights (SDR) as a currency for inter-operator settlements for many years.  We are also seeing the rapid adoption of 'mobile minutes' as a currency in under-banked markets including a number of African nations. So too could a digital currency be used to transact by anyone or anything connected to the web.  If one of them does become widely adopted as a currency, rather than just a commodity, then it will be so pervasive that it will essentially become a global authentication system – the potential of which is almost too staggering to comprehend. As well as simplifying transactions, it would transform business processes and unleash fresh productivity gains for economies around the world.  This is what excites venture capital investors, and also what reinforces my belief that we are still very early on in the wave of technological innovation that we’ve been undergoing for the last two decades.  Rather than viewing bitcoin as a commodity and speculating on its value, we should be exploring how we can create value – through a digital currency that really can be widely adopted.  Those businesses that face transformational changes are most likely already working on their own concepts and designs but there remains immense opportunity for more nimble entrepreneurs. So far I’ve not found any but I hope they will emerge very soon.  This was written by bitcoin commentator, venture capital investor, engineer and entrepreneur Michael Jackson of Mangrove Capital Partners. Michael has discussed bitcoin with governments and at some of the technology industry’s most respected events – including last year’s TechCrunch Disrupt and Dublin Web Summit.

42425398,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTXh,1391610912,CoinSummit San Francisco Announces Itinerary and Speakers,"CoinSummit San Francisco, a two-day invitation-only event aiming to connect virtual currency entrepreneurs, angel and VC investors, hedge fund professionals and bitcoin enthusiasts, has revealed its preliminary agenda and speaker list.  Taking place on 25th and 26th March at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, CoinSummit San Francisco will follow Bitcoin Londonhttp://www.btclondon.com/, the inaugural bitcoin event held by the organisation last July.  Notably, Jackson Palmer, co-founder of Dogecoin, will be making his first public speaking appearance. Other speakers at this year's event include notable members of the bitcoin and digital currency community, such as; Nicolas Cary, CEO of Blockchain.info; Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple Labs; and Alan Safahi, co-founder and CEO of ZipZap.  Angel investor Roger Ver, AngelList's Naval Ravikant, Ribbit Capital's Nick Shalek and Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Venture Partners, will be representing the investment community, among other heavy hitters from Silicon Valley.  CoinSummit's vision  The second major event for CoinSummit, CoinSummit San Francisco is the brainchild of husband and wife team, Pamir Gelenbe, serial entrepreneur and partner at Hummingbird Ventures, and Gulnar Hasnain, former head of environment and sustainability strategy for the mayor of London.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Gelenbe said he felt there was a need for a high quality event focused on CEOs, founders, and investors, and that he and his co-founder chose San Francisco as the host city because the Bay Area is the ""nexus of innovation"" in the US and the world.  ""I guess what I like doing when I get into something is to hold a conference, because that's the best way to meet up with other people. I guess other people would start a website or something, but my way of doing things would be to start a conference,"" Gelenbe said.  Event differentiators  Gelenbe went on to discuss how he and Hasnain have focused on quality over quantity when compiling the guest list for the event, and that panels will be capped at two to three panelists to ensure a lively and focused debate.  ""True debate topics I want to focus on are the price of bitcoin in two to three years, and whether regulation is going to kill this whole thing. Obviously, the answer is somewhere in the middle, but that's one of the innovations we want to bring in terms of content.""  Another differentiator, according to Gelenbe, will be the visually striking location, which he hopes will create an inspiring environment for networking and discussion.  Day one itinerary  Beginning on Tuesday 25th March, the first day will provide panels on investment opportunities in the bitcoin space, bitcoin's regulatory and legal challenges and the future of bitcoin mining, among other topics. Opening remarks will be given by Gelenbe at 10:30 (PST).  First-day speakers will include Carey, Larsen and Shalek, as well as; Patrick Murck, the Bitcoin Foundation's general counsel; Emmanuel Abiodun, CEO and founder of Cloudhashing.com; and a to-be-announced government representative.  Startup pitches will be heard from 14:00 to 15:00, and will feature a handpicked list of startups that Gelenbe believes deserve access to an audience of ""the right people"". He said:  ""Startup pitches will feature three Series A startups pitching for five minutes, then answering questions, so it's going to be very rapid fire.""  Two one-hour intervals starting at 12:15 and 13:15 will provide for networking opportunities. Additionally, a cocktail party will be held from 17:45 to 20:00.  Day two itinerary  Wednesday's events will begin earlier in the day at 9:00 (PST) with a debate on the longevity of bitcoin and continue through 17:30 with closing remarks by Gelenbe.  Notable speakers contributing to day-two discussions include Nejc Kodric, co-founder and CEO of Bitstamp; Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum and Kryptokit; and Brock Pierce, investor and board member at the Mastercoin Foundation.  Day two will also feature two one-hour networking intervals. For a full list of speakers and an up-to-date schedule, click here.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a sponsor of CoinSummit San Francisco.

Now, the celebrity altcoin is taking the next step in its evolution with today's launch of MaxCoin, the official cryptocurrency of financial journalist and host of RT's Keiser Report, Max Keiser.  MaxCoin marks the first time a virtual currency will be endorsed by a pop culture figure prior to its launch. On 28th January, Keiser even participated directly in the mining of MaxCoin's genesis block on episode 555 of Keiser Report:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q684UxfDSU&feature=youtu.be  What is MaxCoin?  Luke Mitchell, a computer science student at Bristol University and head of the MaxCoin project, indicated that MaxCoin aims to establish itself as a viable alternative to bitcoin and litecoin, and would like to differentiate itself from other altcoin options out there by bringing genuine innovation to the table.  ""At the moment, there's a lot of altcoins that are clones of bitcoin or litecoin and that don't really have any special features per se. They're just clones where someone wants to take the amount of coins in circulation, often for maximum profit.""  The developers have promised not to pre-mine MaxCoin before its public launch tonight at 19.30pm (GMT). Perhaps most notably, the currency will use Keccak SHA-3 hashing and will debut as a CPU-mineable coin.  The new algorithm also means SHA-256 bitcoin ASICs and scrypt-based mining rigs cannot be redeployed to mine MaxCoin, putting mining power back into the hands of individuals and amateurs. The network will have a 30 second block time and an initial reward of 96 coins.  Who is Max Keiser?  London-based New York native Keiser has long been a financial journalist. He currently hosts Keiser Report on Russian state-owned network RT, and Iranian Press TV's On the Edge.  He has also produced TV shows for BBC World News and Al-Jazeera English. A well-known bitcoin advocate, he currently writes for the Huffington Post and updates prolifically on his Twitter account.    #Maxcoin went to school on BTC and its cryptography is actually stronger (no NSA influence at all with Maxcoin). @maxcoinproject      — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) February 2, 2014    In his outspoken promotion of all things bitcoin and digital currency-related, Keiser has gained many fans in the community.  If elected mayor of London, he says, he would base the city's entire economy on bitcoin and he has often promoted a strong anti-bank sentiment. Similarly, bitcoin is a frequent topic on Keiser's own website, which features upwards of 20 posts on bitcoin at a time.  Max Keiser criticism  Given his strong stance, Keiser is often criticized as a provocateur. In one notable incident, Keiser called for JPMorgan bankers to be decapitated.  Keiser has used similarly strong words against bitcoin critics like Joe Weisenthal, who chronicled the reaction to his criticism of bitcoin on Business Insider.    @maxkeiser@LibertyBlitz@TheStalwart Max, not a nice thing to say.

42425402,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTdh,1391596204,Cryptocurrency Auroracoin Given to Every Person in Iceland,"A team of Icelandic cryptocurrency enthusiasts is gearing up to launch an altcoin designed specifically for the population of Iceland.  Auroracoin  is a litecoin-based digital currency, 50% of which is pre-mined. This is where it gets interesting: the pre-mined coins will be distributed to the entire populace of Iceland starting on 25th March. Each one of the country’s 330,000 citizens will receive 31.8 auroracoins.  Why Iceland?  Iceland’s banking sector does not have a very good track record, and this appears to be the driving factor behind auroracoin. The team cites the government's use of strict capital controls following the collapse of the local banking sector in 2008.  These controls are still in effect, and the auroracoin team disputes the notion that they are good for the economy, or the people of Iceland for that matter, stating:  “These controls were supposed to be 'temporary', but as with so many government actions, they remain in place to this day. This means that the people of Iceland have, for the past five years, been forced to turn over all foreign currency earned to the Central Bank of Iceland.”  “This means that the people are not entirely free to engage in international trade. They are not free to invest in businesses abroad. The arbitrary use of power this entails and the unsustainable debt of the Icelandic government has created uncertainty and risk in all aspects of commerce.”  The developers' statement continues: “This has had a crippling effect on foreign investment, as foreigners in general avoid investing in Icelandic enterprises, because of the risk of not being able to convert their investment back into dollars or euros.”  Digital currencies are one way of getting around the restrictions. In theory, they could allow consumers and investors to do whatever they like with their money, but only if the government does not step in.  Auroracoin's developers also point out that the Icelandic krona has lost 99.5% of its value since 1960 relative to the US dollar.  Print money, get out of debt  The trouble with the Icelandic financial system is not that it is in some way different than financial systems in other western countries, but that it was relatively small to begin with.  Once the bubble burst, Iceland’s relatively small economy could not help and the country still finds itself in a world of trouble. That explains the devaluation of the krona, as the government can only service its debt if it keeps increasing the money supply, resulting in high inflation.  Auroracoin is supposed to be distributed to the entire population by an “Airdrop” which should reach every citizen. That’s what sets it apart from other altcoins – it will have a large user base at launch, provided people take interest. This is, in part, made possible by Iceland’s extensive ID database.  It is an interesting concept, but it might have a few problems getting off the ground.  First and foremost, it will not be easy to reach the entire population and get them on board. Even if this happens, the government may choose to get involved, but it's an interesting experiment nonetheless.

42425399,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTPh,1391563861,WeCoin88 Slashes Transaction Fees on Art Sales Using Bitcoin,"Another company is using bitcoin to try and disrupt the sale of high-value physical assets by slashing transaction fees, this time in the art world. WeCoin88 is hoping to reduce fees on art sales by around 10% using the digital currency.  WeCoin88 is a service offered by Brussels-based Tutela Capital, a company launched by mathematicians that specializes in applying statistical analysis to art pricing. The spinoff service was launched to handle bitcoin-based conveyancing for art sellers.  Tutela, which advises galleries on how to value their work, uses a database of three million artworks, complemented by machine learning techniques. Cofounder Dr. Fabian Bocart explains that the company got into bitcoin because he is a believer in the digital currency.  ""Because of our mathematics background, we had an interest in bitcoins, and we realized that there were almost no platforms that would enable us to handle physical assets like art, in bitcoins, professionally,"" he explained. ""Bitcoin is like a large economy with a GDP, and art will be a big part of that economy.""  Launched late last month, WeCoin88 is currently offering artworks worth a total of 4500 bitcoins from at least 12 galleries, says Bocart (this varies from week to week). Buyers can purchase artworks in either bitcoins or US dollars, although the physical assets are quoted in bitcoins. However, Tutela mandates that the sellers must take payments in bitcoin.  The rationale for this move is that, while buyers may not be persuaded to purchase pure in bitcoin, sellers are more amenable. He wants sellers of artworks to think exclusively in bitcoin, rather than using it simply as a means to transfer funds into fiat currency.  Fees and logistics  Tutela charges a 3.8% buyer fee, and no seller fee. ""Because we deal in bitcoins, you get rid of the issues related to funds transaction that is really a burden in art,"" Bocart said, adding that security is less of an issue. ""You can rely on a strong network which is basically free.""  Tutela also hope to significantly increase its transaction volumes using the bitcoin mechanism, which will help to drive down transaction fees, he said.  The company has a due diligence process for the sale of its clients' artworks. After the purchaser pays for the art, Tutela holds onto the funds during a 15 day review period, during which the purchaser can change their minds. After that period, the bitcoins are sent immediately to the seller.  Notably, Tutela will not vary the price of the artworks in bitcoin to reflect the volatile nature of the digital currency. Doesn't this leave the company open to traders simply looking for arbitrage opportunities, and potentially expose it to exchange risk?  Sellers could change the pricing themselves, but few do today, Bocart admitted.  ""There is arbitrage in bitcoin as with any currency,"" he said. ""The only difference here is that volatility is higher than in bitcoin. But on the other hand, to have true physical arbitrage, you have to go back to the art market which has costs which are usually very high.""  The cost of art conveyancing normally amounts to 10 – 15% of the artwork's price, he concluded.
