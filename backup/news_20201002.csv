42432815,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1lbh,1601678011,Coinbase Employees Have Begun to Take Severance Packages,"Companies can’t become “apolitical” overnight.      According to multiple Coinbase workers, the plan to offer a clean exit for mission-dissenting staffers has been in the works for six months. So far, at least three people in the 1,200-person firm have taken the severance package, one of these sources told CoinDesk on Friday.      In the past week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong published a blog post discouraging politics in the office and offered a severance package for employees who disagreed with a new mission statement. According to three employees, who all spoke with CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity, Armstrong and other managers at the San Francisco-based crypto exchange said in company-wide meetings that they had been planning this move for six months.      Armstrong began to plan for the company’s new position after several Coinbase engineers closed their laptops one day over the summer after Armstrong wouldn’t say “black lives matter” externally amid social unrest over police killings of unarmed black men and women.      Armstrong recently clarified in company meetings that he could say “black lives matter” (lowercase) and admit to societal injustice but not “Black Lives Matter” (uppercase) and associate himself with the social movement for racial equity. On the day of the walkout Armstrong tweeted:      Another source familiar with the company’s inner workings said the policy was rolled out in response to polarizing political conversations happening in all-company Slack channels and other venues rather than the walkout itself.      Employees are still allowed to have political conversations in non-general channels created by employees, this source added.    Blog-post politics    One employee said Armstrong could have avoided controversy if he had communicated the company’s new direction only internally. (Employees learned of the decision a week prior to the public blog post, staffers said.)      “I think that if he was trying primarily to communicate this to employees and had consulted and listened to really anyone who might be sensitive to the concept of selling this to his employees, this could have blown over and turned into something banal and corporate,” the employee said.      Still another employee said that the timing of the policy’s release was bad. It came at the end of the third quarter, amid rumors of the firm going public, and after a Louisville grand jury failed to charge police officers for murder in the controversial killing of Breonna Taylor.      “I don’t think it was targeted at Black Lives Matter in general,” the employee said of the blog post and new company mission. “We just have a lot of projects we need to get done.”      Multiple employees said the company has distanced itself from employees by moving questions in all-hands meetings to messaging platform Slido after the summer walkout. In a companywide “ask-me-anything” held Thursday, Armstrong and company leadership explained that the new direction doesn’t mean that Coinbase is going after employees that dissent.      “Everyone reaffirmed in the AMA that they do support the blog post but were walking back some of the more extreme implications that might come with being an apolitical company and reaffirmed the commitment to diversity and employee support,” one employee said. “What people might imagine – whether the company is going to be crushing all internal discourse or ejecting employees with strongly held political beliefs – isn’t going to happen.”      It is unclear what punishments employees might face should they not abide by the new decision. That said, leadership has made it clear that the rules around non-work discussions are loose so long as they’re not tied directly to politics.      In response to employees asking if they could make a #spaghetti-monster-for-president Slack channel, leadership said that would be fine, these employees said.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/02/coinbase-employees-have-begun-to-take-severance-packages,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ff948260f0ce779f2d8f4e5f6b4db5fa4068378-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432829,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1m9h,1601671000,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rebounds to $10.5K; Stablecoin Market Cap ‘Goes Parabolic’,"Bitcoin has performed well in the face of a bleak news cycle while stablecoin assets in the crypto ecosystem continue to grow.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,515 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.44% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,362-$10,667  BTC above its 10-day moving average but below the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price stumbled in the early hours of Friday, falling to as low as $10,362 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase around 5:00 UTC (1 a.m. ET) before rising to $10,515 as of press time.      Despite the continuous stream of negative news this past week, the crypto markets have remained resilient, according to Zachary Friedman, chief operating officer of brokerage Global Digital Assets.      “If we look back, we have seen a hack of Kucoin, a major BitMEX lawsuit and even trouble in the traditional markets through the announcement that [U.S. Pres. Donald] Trump contracted COVID-19,” Friedman said. “Historically, these three collective events would have sent markets reeling. This shows that the market is increasingly filled with more bullish investors [who] believe in the fundamentals.”      Bitcoin’s dip to $10,362 Friday is its lowest price point since Sept. 24, well before the recent torrent of bad news began and perhaps a sign of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency’s capacity to recover quickly.      Jean-Baptiste Pavageau, a partner at crypto quant trading firm ExoAlpha, anticipates some increased volatility ahead. “Liquidity is a key metric for professional traders,” said Pavageau. “While BitMEX witnessed sometimes unusual price behavior on its exchange, it would not be surprising to observe more of these spikes and crashes while the liquidity dries-up.”      Read More: BitMEX Moves $337M in Bitcoin Ahead of First Withdrawals Since Charges      Indeed, BTC/USD open interest on BitMEX, a measure of liquidity on derivatives exchanges, has dropped since the revelation of its legal troubles, going from $589 million just prior to the news Thursday to $461 million as of press time, a 21% decline.      As open interest on BitMEX wanes, investors are increasingly moving bitcoin to other exchanges. At one point, an outflow of over 11,000 BTC went to other exchanges at 01:00 UTC Friday, including 4,786 BTC to Binance, 3,899 BTC to Gemini and 989 BTC to Kraken, according to data analysis firm CryptoQuant.      “It’s going to be a volatile couple of weeks,” added Mostafa Al-Mashita, vice president of trading for Global Digital Assets. “I would not be surprised to see another 'black swan' event in the next two months, although bitcoin's price action has been surprisingly bullish considering the news,”      Volatility in bitcoin is positive news for options buyers, and that market has 34,100 BTC in bets placed for expiration on Oct. 30.      The options market for October expiration provides some probabilities for bitcoin’s future price, as traders see a 63% chance of bitcoin over $10,000, a 50% chance over $10,500 and a 36% chance of $11,000 per 1 BTC.      “It's a tough market at the moment, up one minute and down the next,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for crypto brokerage Koine. “I still think there are risks to the downside. Markets don't like uncertainty and we've sure got that until early November.”    Stablecoins over $20 billion    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Friday trading around $344 and slipping 2% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Tether (USDT), at $16 billion, leads the way, with U.S. dollar coin (USDC) in second at $2.5 billion followed by TrueUSD (TUSD) with a $507 million market cap.      A yield farmer who chooses to go by the handle devops199fan believes stablecoins provide an important role as an increasing market for stable assets strengthen the decentralized finance, or DeFi, ecosystem. “The stablecoin market cap is starting to go parabolic,” said devops199fan. “I think we're just getting started.

42432821,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1lrh,1601663837,Belarus News Media Are Testing Decentralized Tech to Resist Censorship,"Belarus is cracking down on reporters.      The nation's government, led by President Alexander Lukashenko, whose election was mired in controversy and has not been recognized by the European Union, announced Friday it was canceling the press accreditations for all foreign journalists immediately. The move comes as Belarus continues blocking its citizens from accessing local media websites, including the Belarusian branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, in the wake of a massive, three-day internet outage and weeks of protests over the Aug. 8 election.      Now, some media outlets are fighting back. To make their mobile apps more resilient, some Belarusian news organizations are using NewNode, a decentralized file-sharing service by the California-based startup Clostra, which basically runs on the same principle as torrents. This means users store bits of content on their devices, sharing them with others in a peer-to-peer fashion.      This story is much bigger than Belarus because Internet censorship is a global phenomenon. While governments around the world are getting more skilled at blocking online content, local activists and media are experimenting with new forms of resistance.    ‘Self-healing network’    The principle behind NewNode is that if one user can’t access a website but another one can, they can connect to each other and exchange available data like torrent clients do. But it won’t help if there is a total internet shutdown, or if the entire mobile network is down.      This makes the technology applicable in places like Belarus, whose Internet shutdown wasn’t absolute. Even the most severe internet outages were a result not of “unplugging” of internet connections but rather of a bottleneck created by intense traffic filtration by the government.      “Devices will connect to one another automatically and build a network and use it to help one another get content using whatever means of Internet access exist. It’s a distributed self-healing network that automatically scales with the number of devices,” explains Stanislav Shalunov, CEO of Clostra.      NewNode is in its infancy now, and the company does not disclose the number of its users worldwide. But when over 800,000 new users in Belarus joined in one month since the election, it was a notable uptick for the company. Before the election, Clostra counted only 10 NewNode users in Belarus. Now Belarus is the largest user base for NewNode, Shalunov said.      “We grow fastest when we can solve the biggest problems, and the shutdowns in Belarus were very significant,” he said.      Before Clostra, Shalunov worked at BitTorrent, and later co-founded another rebel communications startup, Open Garden, the company behind the messaging app FireChat. Firechat, which uses Bluetooth and WiFi to connect mobile phones into an off-line network, took off during the Hong Kong protests in 2014. NewNode uses these two plus the usual mobile internet.      Clostra’s core team also includes former BitTorrent architect Greg Hazel and Blockstream VP of engineering Ben Teitelbaum.      Belorusian media learned about NewNode by “word of mouth,” the executive director of Clostra, Marina Feygelman, told CoinDesk, and because app stores were classifying the app as a VPN. During the internet shutdowns, VPN services surged in popularity in Belarus as people were looking for ways to stay online, and tools like VPNs and proxies helped trick the traffic filtering software employed by the government.    Testing regime    According to Shalunov, there are currently about two dozen media publications worldwide using NewNode for their mobile apps, although most of them prefer not to publicize this fact.      “We’ve been developing our app for people in the countries where the authorities are blocking us,” said Arkady Pildes, senior product manager at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The company recently released its mobile app with NewNode built in, he said.      Radio Liberty’s app is using both NewNode and Psyphon, a proxy that became extremely popular in Belarus during the post-election internet outage. The app can use either NewNode or Psyphon tech, depending on which can provide a faster and more efficient connection, Pildes said, and the switching happens automatically.      NewNode is far from a perfect solution. The tech can create excessive mobile traffic for users who are relaying data to others, putting financial pressure on them if they aren’t using unlimited internet plans, Pildes said.      Another possible caveat is that a Bluetooth connection requires users to reveal their locations. Radio Liberty decided this could be unsafe for its Belarus users, so it did not use that option for its app.      Tut.by, an independent Belarusian news publication whose website users were affected by the post-election internet outage, is now using NewNode tech for its new mobile app. The app on Android has been downloaded over one million times in Google Play, according to Mikita Puzik, Tut.by’s product manager.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/02/belarus-news-media-are-testing-decentralized-tech-to-resist-censorship,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53c9b2528b765d69eb787f6e1592bd799236f527-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432831,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1m7h,1601662520,Bulls Exit BitMEX Bitcoin Futures Market,"Cryptocurrency traders look to be unwinding long positions in bitcoin perpetual futures listed on crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, which has been charged by regulators with facilitating illegal transactions in the U.S.    On Thursday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed civil charges against the exchange while the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed criminal charges accusing four founders and executives of BitMEX of evading rules designed to stop money laundering.  Since the announcements, BitMEX has witnessed an outflow of more than 40,000 bitcoins, currently worth more than $422 million, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis.  Open positions in BitMEX futures have declined by more than 22% from $592 million to $460 million since the CFTC and DOJ announcements and are down more than 50% from the high of $1 billion seen on Sept. 1.  According to data source Skew, the annualized rolling three-month perpetuals (futures without expiry) basis has declined from 6% to 1.84% in the past 24 hours.  Basis refers to the difference between the futures price and the spot price.  Essentially, the BitMEX futures premium has declined from 6% to 1.84% in the past 24 hours. In other words, long positions are being squared off.  Futures usually trade at a premium to spot prices, and the net buying pressure for futures determines the premium.  The differential between the premium offered by other exchanges and BitMEX has widened over the past 24 hours.  That indicates increased urgency among traders to move their bullish leveraged positions away from BitMEX, which could be in for a long, drawn-out battle with the U.S. regulators.  ""BitMEX, with over $70 billion monthly turnovers, has enough resources to keep on fighting with the CFTC and DOJ engaging with the best lawyers in the industry. They have announced their denial of allegations already, and this might turn into a quite long battle,"" said Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin.  However, BitMEX’s market share has been on the decline.  ""Open interest is declining since the beginning of September, and the relevance of BitMEX is getting smaller and smaller,"" Patrick Heusser, senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.

42432811,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1hRh,1601655786,"Money Reimagined: Trump, Crypto and Fairer Taxes","For Democrats, it was a moment of truth. For Republicans, it was “fake news.”      Among some members of the crypto commentariat, there was a very different reaction to The New York Times’ recent scoop on Donald Trump’s tax returns – a bombshell story to kick off a week of even bigger bombshells about the now COVID-afflicted U.S. President. Rather than challenge the story, they challenged the response to it.      The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, Jesse Powell, said it was “fake outrage” and defended citizens’ rights to minimize the state’s incursions into their private property with “legit deductions.” National Football League star and prominent bitcoiner Russell Okung said “Focusing on Trump’s tax returns feels so ...trivial.” And the popular Twitter handle of @DrBitcoinMD suggested the best response would be to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and end taxation altogether.      With eyes wide open to the inevitable Crypto Twitter backlash, let me say these libertarian-inclined takes are wrong-headed. The outcry over a person of such power and privilege paying less to help fund our government than pretty much every other American is not just understandable; it’s a catalyst for badly needed change in the very economic system that the crypto community rightly rails against.      Also, whether we like it or not, taxation – defined broadly as a means by which a community collectively redistributes resources toward defending its common interest – is vital to any governance system. And that includes blockchain governance systems.      Think beyond the functional transaction of a government taking 20% of your paycheck to pay for roads, armies, courts and so forth. Instead, view a nation, or a blockchain’s user base, as a community that needs someone or something to set, enforce and interpret the rules by which its members engage in economic exchange. Without those rules, a community ceases to function, or even to exist. By extension, taxation is unavoidable.      The relevant question, then, is not whether we should pay taxes but how? What is the optimal balance between private interests and public interests? What is fair? Or, better put, how do we make that system reflect our shared interests and not those of the administrators of the taxation regime? Our goal should be to make tax a service, not a means to accumulate unidirectional power.      On this, crypto may have some answers.    Paying for system security    To more deeply explore the parallels between nations and blockchain, we can think of cryptocurrency miners as occupying both the executive and judicial branches of government.      Miners police the ledger and ensure it’s secure for everyone else to use. They also act as judges interpreting the underlying protocol’s “laws,” a process that plays out when there’s a fork in the code. For carrying out these functions, miners use costly energy resources (in proof-of-work mining) or incur opportunity costs in having to lock up funds (in proof-of-stake systems).      And the legislative branch? That’s the developers who write the code that defines the blockchain protocol’s governance rules. They also find bugs – somewhat analogous to unintended legal loopholes – and thus keep users safe from exploits and failures. Doing so, they expend resources in terms of time worked and ideas shared.      The question of how to reward developers has always been tricky for blockchain governance, because most blockchains are open-source projects and because the wrong incentives could create perverse outcomes. (See ICO scams.) Hence the debates over Zcash’s otherwise well-intended 20% developer reward. And the concerns in 2015 about a VC-funded Bitcoin Association’s potential for conflicts of interest that led MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative to take over responsibility for some Bitcoin developers’ salaries. (Disclosure: I took a job at the DCI immediately after that and am still an unpaid adviser there.)      Still, some form of reward to these various “governors” of the system is necessary. This leads to questions not only about who to compensate but about how to obtain the resources for that, and from whom. There are many options.      Most blatantly, taxes can be imposed by directly extracting individual users’ property. For traditional governments, this presents itself as income and property taxes, as well as sales taxes and usage fees for government services. In blockchains, it appears as the transaction fees demanded by miners and validators.      Tax can also be imposed more subtly via an increased money supply, which dilutes the value of users’ property by way of inflation while generating seigniorage income for whichever entity enjoys initial ownership of the currency. Currency-issuing governments monetize their debts this way, but it’s also how Bitcoin users are taxed when miners are rewarded with 6.25 bitcoins for securing a block.    Conflicts and compromises    Given the reality that resources are always limited, decisions over the various design options for these taxation systems are inherently political.      Should a progressive income tax or a regressive sales tax be used, or a combination of the two? Or should we do away with all taxes and instead fund the security system through monetary dilution and managed inflation? (Many crypto libertarians seem opposed to both choices, which leaves us nowhere.)      Similar debates exist in blockchain development. Is a proof-of-work system, with its tendency toward expensive industrialized mining, preferable? Or is proof-of-stake, which is criticized for a bias toward the richest members of the community, better?      The main point, though, is that doing nothing is not an option. The security of the system must be paid for, which means users must be taxed, one way or another.      So we have to compromise. And for that, questions of fairness are vital.      The word “fair” is sometimes maligned for meaning a socialist-leaning version of “equal.” But, to me, it speaks to finding a balance that attracts sufficient consensus to assure the sustainability of the system. It’s the optimal design for breeding trust.      Right now, consensus within the U.S. is as weak as anyone can remember. There’s similarly a lack of consensus among the various crypto tribes competing to be the dominant system. And while they might not use the word, much of that reflects disagreement on which “taxation” systems work best.      The nice thing is that it’s much easier for blockchain users who disagree with a particular taxation model to vote with their feet, to sell one token and buy another, than it is for a citizen of a conflicted nation to emigrate to a better-managed one. In a blockchain, there’s no state power employing its monopoly over legitimized violence to coerce you to stay or go.      So, there’s a lot the crypto community can add to debates over governance models. Just don’t buy into the myth that taxes are unnecessary.    A must-attend Ethereum event    The Ethereum Foundation’s plan to create a new governance model is reaching a critical juncture with the first “Beacon Chain” phase of its long-awaited Ethereum 2.0 upgrade supposedly coming soon. It arrives at an intense moment in the blockchain’s history, as interest and investments in Ethereum-based decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens and stablecoins have exploded.      To mark it, CoinDesk is putting on a star-studded virtual event on Oct. 14. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin will provide the opening keynote, and I’ll be sitting down (virtually) with Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Heath Tarbert to get his take on how regulators will view Eth 2.0 services like staking and what they make of DeFi.      If you’re at all interested in what the future of Ethereum, as well as Dapps, DeFi, NFTs and stablecoins, please register.    Bitcoin and inflation expectations    As noted in prior editions of Money Reimagined, it’s been hard to nail down a consistent theme for investors on bitcoin’s direction this year. At one point, amid the initial COVID-19 shock, bitcoin seemed correlated with gold because both collapsed while a panicked world rushed into dollars. Then, as the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates and bought assets to create bank reserves, the pair recovered in unison as the dollar lost ground.      But soon thereafter they parted ways as bitcoin formed a closer correlation with stocks. More recently, as the market has digested a Fed shift to a more lenient stance on inflation, BTC-gold is back in vogue. It’s all a bit frustrating: whereas bitcoin was once prized as an uncorrelated asset that could add unexpected alpha returns, it’s now in the worst of both worlds: an asset that keeps changing its dancing partners.      This may all be a function of the denominator. Everything is based in dollars, and it’s the dollar that’s moving around against everything. So bitcoin, also quoted in USD, ends up running in lock-step with everything else. We shouldn’t over-analyze occasional departures from trends here and there.      Still, the bitcoin economy is tied to a narrative. And that prevailing narrative is about the looming failure of fiat money: the idea that profligate governments and their complicit central banks will lose control of their currencies’ value, fomenting out-of-control inflation. I personally think consumer-price inflation won’t appear for some time, but do believe the disjuncture between a booming stock market and a deeply depressed real economy is a sign of the kind of financial dysfunction that will make bitcoin attractive regardless of what the Consumer Price Index (CPI) actually says.      Still, given that I’ve been looking for some other indicator that might capture the meta bitcoin narrative, I was happy to get the chart below from my colleague Omkar Godbole. It reminds us not to look at inflation itself, but at how the market is pricing inflation expectations. What people think about future inflation and how about Bitcoin’s place in the world seem quite aligned.      The inflation expectations measure here is not a survey of people’s opinions; it’s hard-coded into the market. The 10-year breakeven inflation rate quantifies the difference between the yield on the ordinary 10-year U.S. Treasury note, whose interest rate coupon is fixed, and the yield on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), whose payout rate is adjusted according to changes in the CPI. As the willingness to protect against inflation grows, the price on the 10-year TIPS also rises, which by definition makes its yield fall. The difference between the lower-yielding TIPS and the higher-yielding fixed-coupon Treasury note of the same duration thus becomes a nifty measure of inflation expectations over 10 years.      If you accept that this correlation is meaningful, there’s actually not that much good news for bitcoin bulls here. Inflation expectations are generally rising on the back of the Fed’s aggressive stimulus and, yes, that seems to align with a recovered bitcoin price. But let’s put this into perspective: the TIPS breakeven point is still below its January peak, shortly before the U.S. entered its current COVID-driven recession in February (marked in the chart by the gray color.) And even then, at 1.8%, that expected rate is below the Fed’s long-term target inflation rate of 2%. The Fed would love to see inflation above 2%. So, if bitcoin is supposed to be a bet against an inflationary blowout, it still has a long way to go.      Still, some caveats: a) As always, correlation is not causation. This chart could be meaningless. And b) I think of Bitcoin as a form of black swan protection. It’s insurance against the kind of event that isn’t reflected in traditional markets’ prices until it's too late, because to bet on it is to assume something so profoundly disruptive that it undermines everything. (Think back to the failure of the mortgage market to absorb the realities of the housing crisis in 2006 and 2007.)      And that brings us back to narrative. There’s a story to tell that the geopolitical framework of the global economy is cracking. The COVID-19 virus, a global economic recession and the potential end of U.S. democracy are a dangerous cocktail. No traditional, quarterly-return, Fed-obsessed institutional investor is going to bet on such a meltdown. Yet, for ordinary people, bitcoin offers a way to do so. If you believe, with conviction, in that narrative, bitcoin’s “meh” moment is a buying opportunity. Both the bullish and the bearish cases are ultimately stories we believe or not.    The global town hall    SURGICAL MONETARY POLICY. If we’re going to talk about the kind of long-term paradigm shifts that are relevant to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology’s outlook, it helps to map out long-term secular trends. So, I’m grateful to the Singapore-based writer who identifies as Pondering Durian for a great take on Bridgewater Associates’ founder Ray Dalio’s analysis of the rise and fall of empires through history.      Dalio observes eight indicators of an empire’s status over time: education levels, whose upturn is shown to be a leading indicator of the emergence of an empire; competitiveness; the country’s role in global trade; the status of innovation and technology; its economic output; the presence of a financial center; its military strength; and the extent of its reserve currency status.      What’s striking is that reserve currency is the lagging indicator, the one that comes last. This makes sense because, thinking of the dollar’s role in the global economy, it enjoys what seems like an unbeatable, self-fulfilling position the U.S. wields to exert its influence all over the world. (See the BitMEX item in Relevant Reads.) But as Dalio points out, eventually, the weight of all those other deteriorating factors gets too much and the reserve currency status also gives way.      The charts in Pondering Durian’s piece include an aggregate of all indicators intended to show the overall measure of imperial power over time. One shows a distinct downturn in the United States’ once unprecedented strength, coupled with a powerful rise in China’s, to the point where they seem about to cross. It affirms the point we’ve been making here: that complacency about the dollar’s perpetuation is dangerous.      The writer then makes the next step and points to a story that “has flown surprisingly under the radar” in Western media: the emergence of China’s digital currency known as the Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DCEP) system. Here, Pondering Durian says, is where China is poised to leapfrog the West in money technology, which in itself could challenge U.S. hegemony. Interestingly, the case being made is not that the DCEP will supplant dollar usage abroad per se, but that it will make China’s capacity to manage its domestic economy so much more efficient than anything that the Fed, under its current design, can do.      Taking an analogy from health care, the writer says it’s all about “precision monetary policy”: the capacity for the central bank to fine-tune the economy by directly managing the money in people’s wallets, rather than having to run policy through the cumbersome and imprecise mechanisms of interest rates and the banking system. This is not about China looking to directly engage the U.S. in trade wars, battles of geopolitical influence, or even try to get its currency on the world stage. It’s about building an empire the way the U.S. did: by improving its own domestic economy and then turning that to its advantage. This is why the U.S. needs to pay attention to the DCEP – why, in fact, it can learn from it.      BETTING ON CIVIL WAR? I really don’t want to get too gloomy, but something about the past week seems to compel it: A ridiculously dysfunctional presidential debate that did little more than present the U.S. as a laughingstock; a U.S. President who suggested he may not accept a peaceful transition of power if election results run against him; and a Supreme Court nomination process that could stir up the deepest angst of America’s culture wars coming at an unimaginably difficult moment.      If you have any doubt the United States is going through a kind of shared manic depression experience, then take a look at this new survey by Engagious, the Sports and Leisure Research Group and ROKK. The three research outfits recently started periodic surveys to produce what they optimistically called their “back to normal barometer,” but this result suggests things are heading exactly in the wrong direction.      It found that 61% of Americans believe the U.S. could be on the verge of another civil war; two-thirds “strongly agree” with the notion. It also found that 52% of consumers have stockpiled food or essential goods in anticipation of social unrest tied to a resurgence of COVID-19 and/or the election. These are not the numbers of a healthy society. They should be relevant to any decision about what to do with one’s money.

The aggressiveness and cross-departmental nature of the BitMEX enforcement action naturally has people wondering whether U.S. regulators have their eyes on other Wild West corners of the crypto world, in particular the DeFI craze. It’s a legitimate question, though, whether decentralized exchanges, which aren’t supposed to have custody of their customer’s assets, are safe from this because of their decentralized design.

Top shelf    BitMEX's big mess The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal prosecutors are charging crypto trading platform BitMEX with facilitating unregistered trading and other crimes. Further, several executives and employees have been charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act, with one in custody. BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes remains at large. It is uncertain how this may affect the crypto industry, though it appears traders took it in stride in intraday trading. More than 32,200 BTC (19% of the exchange's total funds, worth around $337 million) moved off BitMEX before the exchange’s set withdrawal time at 13:00 UTC, according to data source Glassnode.      Digital euro An executive at the European Central Bank (ECB) has said a future digital euro initiative could save the eurozone from relying on digital currencies issued by foreign entities. In a post on Friday, ECB executive member Fabio Panetta, formerly head of the Italian central bank, said the envisioned aim of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be to ""preserve the public good that the euro provides to citizens."" The statement comes as the ECB moves to trademark the phrase “digital euro.” Though, officially, it should be said the central bank is only studying the idea, without committing to issuing a CBDC.      Babel’s leverage Leaked recordings of a private conversation suggest crypto lender Babel Finance leveraged some user funds to long bitcoin and faced potential default risks during this year’s Black Thursday market crash in March. Seven audio files first emerged online that appear to be parts of a longer in-person conversation between Babel co-founder Del Wang and an unknown person. The company disputes this claim. Babel is primarily a savings and loan operation that, according to the recordings, also placed leveraged bets on BTC’s price. Using $750,000 raised from Neo Growth Capital (NGC) and another $4 million as deposits, also from NGC, Babel began taking out positions in early 2019, when the price dropped to $3,000, betting it could reach as high as $18,000, CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhao reports. Things got messy this year, when a coronavirus-led panic crashed the crypto markets.      Atari coin The Atari Group, the company behind such classic video games as Pac-Man, will begin publicly selling its Atari Token (ATRI) cryptocurrency in early November. ATRI is a self-styled entertainment industry payment method in the form of an ERC-20 token atop the Ethereum blockchain. It has been in the works since at least early 2018. Crypto casinos, ""blockchain games"" and the video game distribution platform Ultra.io will be among the utility token's earliest use cases, said Atari's blockchain subsidiary, Atari Chain. The token will list on Bitcoin.com and Atari's own crypto exchange at the close of the public sale.      National and decentralized Venezuela has launched a “decentralized” national stock exchange built atop the Ethereum blockchain. Enabled under a new law listed in the country's Official Gazette on Tuesday, the exchange comes as part of new measures announced by Pres. Nicolas Maduro in a bid to sidestep tough U.S. sanctions. A draft of a wider ""Anti-blockade Law for National Development and the Guarantee of Human Rights,"" aimed to give the government tools to ""defeat all mechanisms of persecution and international blockade,"" was also announced Tuesday in a speech to the country's National Assembly. The news comes soon after Venezuela legalized the cryptocurrency mining industry.

It should already know how risky that is. (David Z. Morris/Fortune)  At stake    Are DEXs better off? The sudden takedown of BitMEX, an institutional part of centralized crypto trading, raises questions about the viability of decentralized exchanges (DEXs).      CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports the value proposition of decentralized platforms is that they are – at least in theory – wholly owned by their communities, rather than their investors or a C-suite of executives.      However, they are founded by real, live humans who are subject to the whims of law enforcement agencies. Are they next?      It seems like BitMEX’s takedown was wholly its own doing, by allegedly serving U.S. customers without proper authorization from the CFTC, and eschewing proper know-your-customer (KYC) requirements up until earlier this year.      But without a figurehead like Chief Executive Arthur Hayes, can the same accusations be leveled against platforms like Uniswap – which create open markets without regulatory oversight that anyone can enter?      “For DeFi builders it might be relevant to have from the start a clear path towards decentralized governance similarly what Ethereum and Bitcoin is today, where there is no centrally controlled entity governing these protocols by design. In the end also remember who you are building for and make safe products for all stakeholders,” Stani Kulechov, co-founder of the Aave DeFi money market, told CoinDesk.      Others, like Robert Leshner, founder of DeFi lending platform Compound, even suggested regulators might find virtue in DeFi. Though time will tell.      For now, there could be apparent security in the limited size of the DEX subsector. The $11 billion DeFi market pales in comparison to the larger centralized exchange (CEX) market, Foxley notes. But the gap is closing.      CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports September volume on DEXs recorded its third consecutive month of doubling. Aggregate trading volume on decentralized exchanges reached $23.6 billion in September up from $11.6 billion in August.    Market intel    Coronavirus scare The cryptocurrency and Asian stock markets sold off early Friday after U.S. Pres. Donald Trump announced he and his wife had tested positive to COVID-19. In a tweet on Friday, Trump said he and First Lady Melania Trump had begun their quarantine process. Bitcoin is also down by 1.9%, having fallen from $10,678 to around $10,400, at press time. The Australia ASX All Ordinaries fell 1.35%, while the S&P 500 futures fell about 2% on the news. ""We will get through this TOGETHER!,"" Trump tweeted.    Internet 2030    Self sovereign identity In today’s internet, most of us have made the Faustian bargain of trading agency for convenience. We trust Facebook with our log-in credentials to countless other sites, the photos of our family, the contents of our private messages, and troves of personal details that can be repackaged, exploited, and weaponized – in just one tiny example, arguably tipping the 2016 election to Donald Trump.      But most of us make that Faustian bargain. We hold our nose and click. We feel that unless we want to be an online hermit, there really is no choice.      But what if we “owned our data,” meaning that instead of trusting the Googles and Facebooks with our precious data – a resource more valuable than oil – we are the custodians of our data, and we only share it when we choose, in certain contexts, and perhaps we can sell it or license it?      “You’re re-democratizing the internet,” says Drummond Reed, chief trust officer of Evernym, one of the organizations trying to make SSI a reality. “You’re pushing the power, literally, out to the peers.” Reed is no Pollyanna, and he doesn’t expect the Facebooks to vanish in the next decade, but he predicts that “we will see a pretty dramatic reshaping of the power distribution.”      Okay, but what would that actually mean from a user experience? SSI can be an abstract concept, making even Bitcoin look simple and easy to explain. It’s tough to visualize or appreciate. So for this scenario, we’ll envision some ways that SSI – and ownership of your data – would change your (online) life.      Welcome to a better internet.

As first reported by Decrypt, the popular crypto exchange emailed some users saying that as part of a deal with HMRC, it must provide records on customers who had received more than £5,000 ($6,500) during the 2019-2020 tax year.  The email appears to have been only sent to users the exchange believed crossed that threshold; it encourages them to reach out to their accountants or tax advisers.  The notice comes over a year after HMRC first requested crypto exchanges send over information on U.K. residents who had moved money on their platforms.  Per the email, Coinbase said HMRC had originally requested records on its customers between 2017 and 2019, but a compromise limited the data to customers using digital assets to receive greater amounts.  In the U.K., cryptocurrencies count as an investment asset and are subject to capital gains tax, which for high-income earners can come to approximately 20% on gains.

42432812,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1hPh,1601646666,"Trump COVID Test, BitMEX Charges Bring October Shocks for Bitcoin","U.S. regulators and law-enforcement officials brought charges on Thursday against BitMEX, a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange that has grown in recent years to be one of the industry's biggest players.      According to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, prosecutors accused BitMEX of facilitating unregistered trading and other violations, including ""conducting significant aspects of its business from the U.S. and accepting orders and funds from U.S. customers,"" as reported by CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De.      The news dominated cryptocurrency news headlines and sent traders and analysts scrambling to assess the damage and implications. Some 23,000 bitcoin were apparently withdrawn from BitMEX addresses in a single hour, the cryptocurrency-markets data firm Glassnode tweeted early Friday, citing blockchain data.      BitMEX, led by CEO Arthur Hayes, said it intends to defend against the allegations ""vigorously"" adding that the trading platform was operating normally and that all funds were safe.      Bitcoin prices tumbled after the announcement, as illustrated by CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey in an hourly price chart:      Cryptocurrency traders are conditioned to expect volatility whenever there's major news involving one of the biggest industry exchanges, but despite the quick drop, prices quickly stabilized, as reported by CoinDesk's Zack Voell.      BitMEX is a well-known player in the constellation of global cryptocurrency exchanges, partly because it was a pioneer, in 2016, of a new product called the “perpetual bitcoin leveraged swap.” At the time, few traders in nascent digital-asset markets could have anticipated what a major impact the obscure roll-out would have on the industry.      But the instrument, which made it easy for customers to trade the equivalent of $100 of bitcoin for every $1 down, proved hugely popular and successful among risk-hungry traders, vaulting BitMEX into the top ranks of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.      Even so, the perpetual swaps were infamous for exacerbating price swings: It’s a well-known trope among bitcoin traders that every time the market tilts one way or another, BitMEX customers’ thinly capitalized positions get liquidated in a series of rapid margin calls, exacerbating price swings that reverberated to other exchanges.      Such episodes are so notorious that crypto traders even have a slang verb for the phenomenon: to get ""rekt,"" with websites and even Twitter accounts devoted to tracking their magnitude and frequency.      If BitMEX's role in the markets were to diminish, that might mean fewer volatility-inducing liquidations.      “Long term, it’s so much better for the spot market,” Steve Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager Digital, an online cryptocurrency trading platform, told First Mover.      Industry executives were quick to point out that some traders had apparently been shifting their allegiances recently to rival exchanges that had copied BitMEX's ""100x"" bitcoin derivatives contracts.      “Two years ago, this would have been catastrophic, because BitMEX was such a huge percentage of everybody who’s playing leveraged trading,” David Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes Inc., told CoinDesk's Muyao Shen in a phone interview. “Now, there are quite a few alternatives to BitMEX and several of them have always been more stringent about trading or not allowing U.S. clients to trade on those platforms.”      CoinDesk's William Foxley reported that the BitMEX news reverberated in the fast-growing blockchain-based sector of ""decentralized finance,"" or DeFi, where programmers are developing semi-automated platforms for lending and trading.      The systems are often cast as ""uncensorable"" since they mainly exist within strings of programming encoded atop the Ethereum blockchain network. The question is whether they still might be subject to the laws of various jurisdictions, since they are, ultimately the craft of ""real, live humans.""      Centralized exchanges such as BitMEX as “opaque platforms that can easily facilitate money laundering,” Robert Leshner, founder of the DeFi lender Compound, told Foxley. “By contrast, DeFi done right is a breath of fresh air – complete transparency, accountability, tamper-resistance and self-custody.”      Ahem.      Cryptocurrency industry regulations are still evolving, and the rulemakers are always a few or myriad steps behind. But they do sometimes crack down, and it's probably not a coincidence that often they take aim at the most threatening upstarts, those that attempt to change the rules of the game.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin has come under pressure in the past 24 hours, seemingly due to the BitMEX controversy and risk-off moves in traditional markets.      On Thursday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal prosecutors announced they're charging BitMEX for failing to implement anti-money-laundering procedures and operating an unregistered trading platform.      Further, President Trump announced early Friday he and his wife had tested positive for coronavirus and were going into self-quarantine, ratcheting up pre-election uncertainty and sending global equities lower.      Bitcoin has declined from $10,900 to $10,400 in the past 24 hours. The daily chart now shows the cryptocurrency is stuck in a narrowing price range.      A triangle breakdown would signal a continuation of the sell-off from August's high above $12,400 and expose the 200-day average support at $9,400.      Alternatively, a breakout could invite stronger chart-driven buying pressure.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: BitMEX Moves $337M in Bitcoin Ahead of First User Withdrawals Since US Charges    Token Watch    Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum developers will take a second whack at a final Ethereum 2.0 “dress rehearsal” after the first, Spadina, failed due to “critical peering issues.”    What's Hot    A partner at Goldman Sachs, Damien Vanderwilt, is joining Galaxy Digital at the beginning of 2021 (The Block)      September volume on DEXs recorded its third consecutive month of doubling the trading volume from the previous month (CoinDesk)      The European Central Bank has applied for a trademark on the phrase “digital euro,” according to Bloomberg reporting (CoinDesk)      Nearly $8 billion have been added to the aggregate supply of stablecoins in the past three months (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    U.S. economy added 661K jobs, below 875K estimate and slowing from 1.49M in August (Bureau of Labor Statistics)      Emerging-market countries could experiment with quantitative easing, suggests new study led by New York Fed economist (New York Fed)      U.S. House passes $2.2T stimulus bill that is unlikely to get through Senate (CNBC)      U.S. companies issue $1.4T over first nine months of 2020, as record issuance facilitated by Federal Reserve backstop (WSJ)      If Democrats win the presidential election that may be good for stocks, because of the likelihood of more fiscal stimulus (CNBC)      Bond-rating firm Moody's cuts New York State and New York City to Aa2 from Aa1 (WSJ)      Rents on apartments in New York City to San Fransisco are plummeting as people shift to work-from-home (Bloomberg)      Capital expenditures needed to reorient multinational corporations export operations out of China would cost $1T (WSJ)    Tweet of the Day",NEGATIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/02/trump-covid-test-bitmex-charges-bring-october-shocks-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a796ffd95a199b98a9425304bfe9124d1fdf017a-1300x928.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432792,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1grh,1601645860,Ripple Wins US Patent for New Oracle-Based Smart Contract Design,"Blockchain payments technology firm Ripple has won a patent for a design that can execute smart contracts based on data collected from the outside world.    Earlier this week, Ripple Labs received a patent (No. 10,789,068) for a smart contract that can use oracles to connect a distributed platform to a variety of different real-world data.  Originally filed in June 2018, one example of a use case provided includes using the smart contracts to automatically settle options contracts when pre-agreed conditions are met, such as a company's debt-to-equity ratio hitting a certain threshold.  Another example, for the oil industry, is feeding data on the density of a specific crude oil shipment to help a smart contract determine whether to make a trade.  Smart contracts are mostly associated with Ethereum, but other large blockchains are looking to add similar capabilities.  Earlier this year, derivatives exchange BitMEX, which is now facing legal troubles, awarded a $50,000 grant to a Bitcoin Core contributor to develop a Bitcoin smart contract.  One of the two authors of the patent, Ripple’s former CTO Stefan Thomas, previously revived a defunct project called Codius – one working to bring smart contracts to Ripple – into a new startup, Coil.  While a patent indicates that time and effort going into a rough draft of, in this case, a new smart contract-based derivative, it doesn't necessarily mean that Ripple has any active plans to move ahead with development.  CoinDesk reached out to Ripple for comment but hadn't received a response by press time.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York both announced they are charging BitMEX with facilitating unregistered trading and other illegal transactions.  Since then, more than 32,200 BTC (worth around $337 million) has been moved from BitMEX – 19% of the exchange's total funds, according to data source Glassnode.  Further, outflows are likely to greatly increase following BitMEX's daily withdrawal time of 13:00 UTC.  That's when the exchange processed all withdrawal requests lined up since the previous day.  Open positions in bitcoin perpetuals (futures without expiry) traded on BitMEX have also declined by nearly 22% from $592 million to $462 million, according to data provided Skew, a crypto derivatives research firm.  However, liquidity, as measured by the bid/offer spread, on the exchange remains relatively stable, and the large trades can still be executed at low cost.  The daily average spread between the buy and sell orders (bid/offer spread) on BTC perpetuals for a $10-million quote size remains unchanged on the day at 0.34% – near the lower end of the three-week-long range of 0.32% to 0.39%.  Bid-offer spreads on other exchanges also remain stable.  According to Philip Gradwell, economist at blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, outflows from BitMEX are adding to liquidity on other exchanges.  ""Total inflows to exchanges averaged 65,000 bitcoin this last week, so BitMEX withdrawals are adding 25% more liquidity already,"" Gradwell tweeted early on Friday.  ""More than 65% of the total outflow has been transferred to other exchanges, while the rest into unhosted wallets,"" he added.  Stable liquidity on BitMEX and other exchanges suggests there's no serious panic among traders following the U.S. charges.  According to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, BitMEX's reputation among large trading firms had already been dented by outages seen earlier this year.  As such, its overall importance to the broader ecosystem is not as critical as was the case a few years ago, Vinokourov said.

42432797,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1gxh,1601631267,"Digital Euro Will ‘Protect’ Eurozone From Foreign Issuers, Says ECB Exec","An executive at the European Central Bank (ECB) has said a future digital euro initiative could save the eurozone from relying on digital currencies issued by foreign entities.    In a post on Friday, ECB executive member Fabio Panetta, formerly head of the Italian central bank, said the envisioned aim of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be to ""preserve the public good that the euro provides to citizens.""  But a digital euro would also ensure foreign-based issuers, whether that's other central banks or private companies, don't become too integral to the eurozone's stability – something that could even threaten the ECB's monetary sovereignty.  The post comes as the central bank releases its report into the proposed digital euro.  Running to 54 pages, the paper argues CBDCs stand to provide citizens with a ""risk-free"" form of money, unlike cryptocurrencies and private stablecoins, which could require users to surrender their financial privacy to for-profit entities.  It would also offer citizens easier access to a payment method, thereby improving financial inclusion.  The report also touches on the theme of protecting the eurozone's monetary sovereignty: A digital euro could ensure ""strategic autonomy"" for the bloc, as well as bolster the euro's international standing as a reserve currency.  The worry that, just like with the tech giants, the European Union could end up relying on foreign providers for payments, has been palpable across the continent over the past year.  ECB President Christine Lagarde said in Germany last month that the EU had fallen behind countries like China in CBDC development.  More directly, France's economic and finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said last year Facebook's libra coin actually threatened to undermine the European project.

Enabled under a new law listed in the country's Official Gazette on Tuesday, the exchange comes as part of new measures announced by President Nicolas Maduro in a bid to sidestep tough U.S. sanctions.  A draft of a wider ""Anti-blockade Law for National Development and the Guarantee of Human Rights,"" aimed to give the government tools to ""defeat all mechanisms of persecution and international blockade,"" was also announced Tuesday in a speech to the country's National Assembly.  Already launched, the new BDVE exchange is built to enable Venezuelan investors to trade stocks, bonds and real estate in digital form.  It is said to run on the Ethereum blockchain digitizing traditional assets using the ERC-223 and ERC-721 token standards, according to its operation manual.  Authorized by the office of the National Securities Superintendence, the exchange will undergo a trial for 90 days, during which time authorities will decide whether to approve or revoke its trading license.  U.S. sanctions have hit Venezuela's economy hard in what Maduro calls a violation of Venezuela's human rights.  The president said the anti-sanctions law would empower Venezuela's oil-backed cryptocurrency, known as the petro, as well as other cryptocurrencies, for national and foreign trade.  The news comes soon after Venezuela legalized the cryptocurrency mining industry, but at the same time specified that private operations must all work through a pool controlled by the government.

42432809,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1hLh,1601625768,Cosmos Gains Traction in India Amid Broader Crypto Resurgence,"As demand for bitcoin surges in India, especially in urban tech hubs, smart-contract platforms like Ethereum and others are also gaining momentum.      Cosmos, promoted by the Switzerland-based Interchain Foundation, is especially finding traction with students like Aditya Nalini at the Vellore Institute of Technology in southern India. He’s one of four “ambassadors” trained by the community organization Cosmos India, founded in November 2019. The Cosmos India community grew from a handful people in 2019 to more than 1,000 participants in less than nine months, local organizers say, despite the pandemic.      Nalini now holds the majority of his modest wealth in cryptocurrency, he said via email, after initially discovering the collectibles game CryptoKitties in 2017. Although bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, Nalini says he has never owned bitcoin and says there are many students like him.      Meanwhile, there’s a bull market raging across Indian crypto exchanges. Global exchanges have also seen an increase in demand for altcoins like ATOMs. None of this is to say Cosmos is the leading cryptocurrency project of 2020. Yet, as a much younger project than Ethereum or Bitcoin, it is quickly gaining brand recognition.      “OKEx ... saw record high numbers when alt season was at its height in August,” said OKEx press manager Vivien Choi, speaking to markets that include India but aren’t limited to it. “OKEx has seen a rise in demand for ATOM especially last month throughout the globe.”      Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which both already have strong brand identities, Cosmos is still relatively new to Indian crypto fans. This gives the project the feel of being the “next big thing.” Nalini described the Cosmos ecosystem as the “father” network, because the Cosmos interoperability project allows all the different altcoin projects to “talk and take help from one another instead of fighting for dominance.”      Instead of holding bitcoin (BTC), Nalini holds ether (ETH) and Matic tokens, in addition to ATOM.      “My portfolio currently has 60% atoms, 30% matic and 10% ether, where ETH is more to interact with dapps and play than from an investment standpoint,” Nalini said. “Being a student, it was extremely difficult building a portfolio. ... I built mine by winning competitions, participating in bounties and winning giveaways.”      Read more: Matic Launches Mainnet Aiming to Bring More 'Firepower' to Ethereum      Local hackathons and meetups have been the engine fueling India’s crypto boom. According to Cosmos India co-founder Abhitej Singh – who is also the communications lead at the organization’s sponsor startup, Persistence One – roughly 1,000 Indian people participated in Cosmos programs so far in 2020. This work is largely funded by a grant from the Interchain Foundation, which manages nearly $104 million generated since the ATOMs token sale in 2017.      “One of the key goals for Persistence One is interoperability, hence there is a lot of alignment with Cosmos' vision,” Singh said in an email.    Education    Beyond meetups and ambassador training, Cosmos India also operates outreach programs at the Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology (NMIT) in Bangalore and the International Institute of Information Technology in Hyderabad.      For example, after working with Cosmos India, NMIT Professor Sanjay H.A. said he will add a Cosmos case study to his blockchain engineering course next semester.      “What I liked about Cosmos is interoperability,” he said. “Usually the sixth semester starts during January. But, due to the pandemic, it may start during March 2021 for this academic year.”      Beyond university courses, meetups appear to attract a few dozen participants each, even up to 75 people at an event co-hosted with the startup Inblox Network during Bangalore Blockchain Week in February 2020.      Read more: India May Be Starting Its Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Yet      “Students play a significant role in driving the narrative for any new technology in India,” Singh added, speaking to academic collaborations already in process. “We aim to connect with around 50,000 students over the next year through the webinars, hackathons, tutorials and student chapters. Our goal is also to have Cosmos in the curriculum as an optional course in at least five universities.”    Upstart coins    Bitcoin is still undeniably king in the Indian crypto market. But targeted student programs may determine which rupee-altcoin pairs become mainstays on locally accessible exchange platforms.      “Our initial volume was huge and ATOM-INR volume was among the highest ATOM pairs worldwide for a couple of days,” said Vikram Rangala, CMO at the Indian exchange ZebPay. “Interest from that group tends to shift between tokens depending on which one is active at the moment. But Cosmos also has a lot of support from long-term investors and developers here.”      However, Rangala added this may merely be a broader bull-market effect.      “We launched other tokens since then which may have gotten more attention,” he said.      Read more: Cosmos’ Founding Team Broke Up Early This Year. The Project Didn’t      For comparison, Ethereum’s greatest strength has arguably been its community-building strategy, including educational initiatives by Ethereum advocate Natalia Ameline. As for the Cosmos community, Nalini said more than 300 people registered in less than a week for the next Cosmos hackathon, HackAtom India.      “The Cosmos community is rapidly growing in India,” Nalini said, especially among students.      “Ethereum and Bitcoin communities are still very large, compared to Cosmos,” he said. “But it’s also because of the first movers advantage. ... At Cosmos India, something that is very unique is the inclusion of colleges and universities in the outreach program. No other blockchain community has done it so far.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,"Leigh Cuen, Shuai Hao",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/02/cosmos-gains-traction-in-india-amid-broader-crypto-resurgence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d9003c5293076023db07fa5198b2774d48b9f81-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432801,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1h5h,1601596800,Leaked Recordings Suggest Crypto Lender Babel Leveraged Users' Funds in Longing Bitcoin,"Leaked recordings of a private conversation suggest crypto lender Babel Finance leveraged some user funds to long bitcoin and faced potential default risks during this year’s Black Thursday market crash in March.      Seven audio files first emerged online on Sept. 25 that appear to be parts of a longer in-person conversation between Del Wang, co-founder of Beijing-based Babel, and an unknown person.      The recordings offer a rare hint of strategies taken by the industry’s nascent crypto lenders in managing their balance sheets, suggesting some business practices may be different from what they claim.    The audio files were initially uploadedhttps://anchor.fm/scamstophere/episodes/1--NGC754m-ek3vve to Anchor.fm by an anonymous Twitter user on Sept. 25 but were soon taken down by the platform after Babel filed complaints. The anonymous Twitter user then posted the recordings to YouTube.    Several people familiar with the company listened to the recordings and confirmed to CoinDesk that it was Wang speaking. In one of the files, the unknown person also addressed Wang by his full name.      In a written response to CoinDesk on Sept. 30, a Babel representative said the company is unable to confirm the authenticity of the recordings because they are “fragmented” and “clearly artificially edited.”      The representative said they can’t comment on the content of the recordings and claimed the accusations made by the anonymous publisher were baseless and not factual. Wang didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on the recordings.      Following Babel’s initial response to Decrypt that the recordings could be patched together, the anonymous Twitter account posted two longer recordings on Sept. 30 that contain the previous seven parts. The new recordings suggest the conversations happened around March 20.      Founded in 2018, Babel Finance is registered in Hong Kong with operations based in China. It has essentially taken on the role of a crypto bank in the industry by offering both saving and lending products. One of its money drivers was the difference between lending and saving interest.      But according to the leaked recordings, Babel also bet that bitcoin’s price would rise and leveraged both its own and some customer funds to long bitcoin, which faced potential default risks during bitcoin’s 60% crash six months ago.    ‘It’s called X Plan’    In the additional recordings published on Sept. 30, Wang can be heard saying Babel started buying bitcoin in early 2019 when its price was around $3,000. The initial capital for those purchases came from the $750,000 raised from Neo Growth Capital (NGC) and another $4 million as deposits, also from NGC.      When asked why NGC didn’t buy bitcoin with the $4 million, Wang said NGC wasn’t planning to use that money for such a purpose. An unidentified partner at NGC reportedly said he was not aware of the NGC funds being used to speculate on bitcoin’s price.      Wang apparently said in the recording that Babel adopted a strategy where it pledged the bitcoin it purchased to another lender in order to borrow more money when bitcoin’s price went up to $4,000.      With the newly borrowed money, it continued buying more bitcoin. When bitcoin’s price went up again, it repeated the same method, which put more leverage on its long positions. “We became the customer of ourselves,” Wang said in the recordings.      “We kept increasing our [bitcoin long] positions starting from $3,000 all the way to $14,000,” Wang was heard saying in the recordings. “Initially we had about 3X leverage, but then we leveled up as bitcoin’s price surged.”      Read more: What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn’t Telling Its Depositors      “It’s called X Plan,” Wang said in the recording, seemingly referring to the leverage strategy. “Initially only Flex Yang [Babel’s CEO and the other co-founder] and I knew about it. But later on three other shareholders also became aware of the plan.”      Babel declined to elaborate on X Plan or comment specifically on the usage of NGC’s funds in the beginning, claiming information with its customers is confidential.      The apparent upside of this method is the multiplied return on the back of bitcoin’s bull run in the first half of 2019, when bitcoin went from $3,000 to $14,000.      Wang said in the recording that when bitcoin reached $14,000, the firm did realize this was not a long-term game and initially set a profit-stop order at $18,000. Even though it had later lowered the stop order targets, it didn’t fully close its positions.      “Had we closed our positions even at $10,500, we could have made net profits of two to three hundred million yuan [around $30 million to $40 million],” Wang was heard saying.      But the downside was the risk of how quickly Babel’s crypto reserves could react to margin calls from its capital sources for more bitcoin if bitcoin’s price suffered a sudden plunge.    User funds    Babel boasts that it is one of the major crypto lenders in the world, claiming to have over $350 million in outstanding loans as of June 30 this year.      But customers’ deposits only constitute a relatively small part of the money that’s available for borrowers. A majority of Babel’s capital comes from other institutional lenders.      Babel’s CEO and co-founder Flex Yang said prior to March 12 his firm was able to enjoy a collateral-to-loan (CTL) rate as low as 100% for borrowing funds from its capital sources. The firm’s main capital partners included BlockFi, Genesis Capital and Tether at the time.      That means Babel would only need to pledge $1 million worth of bitcoin in order to borrow $1 million of USDT.      But, when lending this amount to its own customers, Babel required an over 160% CTL rate, meaning borrowers needed to put in over $1.6 million worth of bitcoin as collateral. As such, Babel would have the difference of the $600,000 worth of bitcoin collateral sitting on the liability side of its balance sheet.      One reason Babel could enjoy a more attractive collateral rate from its capital sources is because it advertises that Chinese bitcoin miners who are able to generate bitcoin organically and meet margin calls if needed are its primary lending customers.      In an ideal situation, the risk would be relatively low for Babel if it holds all the $600,000 bitcoin collateral in the example above within its reserve.      But the reality appears to be muddier because Babel didn’t exactly draw a fine line between its own assets and user funds, according to Wang in the recording.      Read more: SEC Orders Salt Lending to Offer Refunds to Investors in Its $47M ICO      In the response to CoinDesk, Babel claimed that customers’ collateral is either stored in cold wallets or further lent out to counterparties while taking in USDT as collateral.      “The situation of Babel using customers’ funds to trade crypto doesn’t exist,” the firm claimed in the statement.      But then that raises a question of how it could even differentiate customers’ positions from its own long positions if they were bundled together to execute a leverage plan.      In one of the recordings, the unknown person said to Wang: “Strictly speaking, these [user] funds do not belong to you, and you should not have used them as leverage.”      “Right,” Wang answered, explaining: “The money we used to buy bitcoin came from our fundraise, our interest profits and profits we made through increasing our long positions.”      The person went on to question: “If it was all just your own asset, you couldn’t have got this large [long] position. … That means you probably have also used parts of borrowers’ collateral and depositors’ funds.”      Wang did not directly answer with a yes or no to that question but said that “if considering ourselves as a customer, then our funds and real users’ funds are all mixed up together.”      “The good customers are the real customers. The bad customers are ourselves,” Wang was also heard saying in the recording.      Babel declined to disclose how large its long positions were before this year’s March sell-off.    March 12    The real risk didn’t start to materialize until March 12, when bitcoin’s price crashed by over 60% in a matter of a day.      The sudden drop led to a severe devaluation of Babel’s collateral at its capital sources, to the extent that its collateral at Tether at one point was worth below 80% of what Babel had borrowed from the USDT issuer, people familiar with Babel’s operations told CoinDesk.      The people said at that point Babel owed Tether 2,000 to 3,000 BTC just to meet the 100% CTL rate. If Tether chose to liquidate Babel’s position, itself would also suffer a loss since the bitcoin collateral it had was worth much less than the money it lent out at that point.      When asked why Babel didn’t send in more bitcoin to meet the margin calls from its capital sources during the March 12 crash, Wang said in the recording the firm didn’t have the coins for its own positions. He said Babel later liquidated some borrowers’ positions worth 3,000 to 4,000 BTC but didn’t exactly sell them.      Babel declined to comment on Wang’s comment about it falling short of reserves to meet margin calls but claimed it didn’t default any borrower due to its own violation of terms, such as failing to pay back collateral as demanded.      Babel said it also didn’t default any institutional lenders and there was no forced liquidation from its capital partners due to Babel’s own violation of terms.      But one smaller lending partner, Hong Kong-based OSL, force-liquidated Babel’s more than 500 BTC collateral following the March 12 crash, according to screenshots of conversations between the two seen and reviewed by CoinDesk.      Yang said the forced liquidation came after Babel met OSL’s margin calls and subsequently blamed OSL for the act instead of itself. OSL has not yet responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment.      In fact, the people familiar with the situation said when the March 12 crash happened, Babel asked for credit loans from Tether so it could meet margin calls from other lenders and subsequently transferred the debts to the USDT issuer.      Read more: $100M+ in Margin Calls: Crypto Lenders Demand Collateral as Market Buckles      According to the sources, Babel also managed to get Tether to agree to extend its margin call deadline to a month so that it would have more leeway to send more collateral.      To gain Tether’s trust for that, Babel even proposed to pledge some of its equity to Tether, which declined the offer but took Babel’s words, according to email exchanges reviewed by CoinDesk between the two parties just days after the market crash.      “Essentially, at that very moment, Babel was in debt to both its customers as well as its capital sources,” the people said of the risks Babel endured at the time.      Babel declined to comment on Tether’s help, citing it cannot disclose business details with its partners without proper approval.      Tether also declined to comment and said it cannot and will not confirm whether it has any client relationship with any private party.      But the market’s bounce back to above $6,000 within weeks after March 12, together with Tether’s extension and Babel’s new saving products afterwards, helped the firm gather more bitcoin and alleviated its risks for the time being.      Babel declined to disclose its current bitcoin long position but said its overall leverage is kept within three to five times. “We are supporters of crypto assets. Our net assets and a majority of our profits are stored in the form of bitcoin but we adjust the balance based on market’s volatility,” it said.      It’s unclear where Babel’s balance sheet sits right now. The firm said it has expanded its investment into risk management with custody partnerships with Coinbase Custody and is working on opening a custody account with Fidelity. It has hired an internal compliance offer and is working with an outside auditor to up its level in financial transparency.
