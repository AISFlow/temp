18574110,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554665,1696892423,Top 5 Altcoins For October 2023 That Could 20X Your Crypto Portfolio,"By now, Bitcoin has grown to the point where crypto investors do not expect very large returns from it and are now looking toward altcoins that could provide the kind of returns they seek. However, with thousands of altcoins circulating in the crypto market, it can become quite hard to pick the coins that could end up doing well. So here are five altcoins that are well-positioned to do well in the next bull market that could potentially 20x your crypto portfolio. Lido DAO (LDO) Is A Top Crypto Contender Lido DAO (LDO) has grown rapidly to dominate the Ethereum liquid staking game, accounting for over 30% of all staked ETH in LSD protocols. This has brought immense attention to its native token, LDO, which on its own has also seen a good run over the years. Related Reading: Crypto Investor Buying Power Just Reached A 6-Month High, What This Means However, at just a $1.4 billion market cap, LDO is still what can be referred to as undervalued given its standing in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. A bull market could easily see the market cap of LDO cross $30 billion, which would be a more than 20x return on investment from its current $1.61 price level. Arbitrum (ARB) Dominates Ethereum Layer 2 Altcoins Arbitrum (ARB) features on this list because of the network’s performance over the years. Of all the Ethereum Layer 2 networks currently in the game, Arbitrum leads the pack both in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) and daily trade volume. This puts it ahead of the likes of Optimism (OP), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polygon (MATIC), all of which have been in the game just as long. However, of the 4 leading Ethereum L2s, Arbitrum has the lowest market cap. At $1.08 billion, it is yet to see the same kind of surge its competitors saw in 2021 due to the token launching in the bear market. Arbitrum’s performance even in a bear market shows that it could easily be a top 10 cryptocurrency in the bull market. Related Reading: Why You Should Pay Attention To The XRP Price Predictions Stacks (STX): The Crypto Child Of Bitcoin Currently, when crypto investors think of NFTs and DeFi on the Bitcoin network, they think of Stacks (STX). This is because Stacks is a Layer 2 network that allows the usage of smart contracts on Bitcoin. This means developers are able to build protocols as well as launch NFT collections on the Bitcoin network using Stacks (STX). STX’s market cap is still very low at just $715 million especially given what it enables developers to do on the Bitcoin network. This offering makes sure that Stacks is always on the radar of investors, making it a billion-dollar token that could easily bring 20x returns. Total market cap excluding Bitcoin is $514 billion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap Exclude BTC on Tradingview.com Kava (KAVA) Joins The Fun With Layer 1 Technology Kava (KAVA) has been building up into mainstream adoption despite competition with the biggest networks in the space. This Layer 1 blockchain is taking another route to interoperability by combining the best parts of the Ethereum and the Cosmos networks. Related Reading: LINK Price Primed For Meteoric Rise: Analyst Predicts 130% Rally To $18 Ethereum is known for its developer power, enabling developers to build pretty much anything, but still held down by slow transactions and high fees. On the other hand, Cosmos has some of the highest speeds and interoperability and when both of these are combined, it presents basically a supercharged Layer 1 blockchain equipped to handle almost anything. Its native token KAVA is already one of the most watched Layer 1 native tokens, and at a $500 million market cap, it’s fair to say that this altcoin is far from done. Altcoins Are Not Complete Without The Trust Wallet Token (TWT) With so many centralized exchanges running into issues such as hacks and bankruptcy, more crypto investors are choosing to self-custody their coins. The top 2 self-custody wallets that also allow users to take advantage of DeFi and NFTs are MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Since only the latter currently has a token, it has been able to corner that market share for itself. Related Reading: Brace For Impact As $200 Million In Crypto Is Being Unlocked In October Trust Wallet’s native TWT token rose in popularity when the FTX crypto exchange crashed in 2022 and has not stopped. Going into the bull market, self-custody is expected to be the main avenue to store coins and TWT’s current $411 million market cap could quickly turn into an $8 billion market cap in the bull market.

42392362,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5nbL,1696889266,Real-World Asset Loan Worth $20M at Risk of Losing $7M on DeFi Platform Goldfinch,"A tokenized loan worth $20 million soured in a lending pool on decentralized lending platform Goldfinch after borrower Stratos’ bets on a real-estate tech company and digital asset investments “has not performed as expected,” protocol contributor Warbler Labs said Saturday in a protocol governance forum post.  Now, some $7 million of the $20m funds are at risk of loss, Warbler disclosed.  The distressed pool made a four-year loan of $20 million worth of [USDC] stablecoins with an 11% annual interest rate to fintech credit fund Stratos in February 2022. Warbler Labs was one of the 43 ""backers"" and underwriters of the loan, a spokesperson said.  Stratos allocated $5 million of the funds to REZI, a real-estate tech firm focusing on apartment rentals in major U.S. cities, which has now stopped paying and is expected to write down the position to zero, the post said.  Another $2 million of the funds – dedicated to something it called POKT – was allocated to “digital asset investments” Warbler Labs said it “was not aware of at the time of the investment,” according to the post. Stratos sold this position at a “near full loss,” and added loan collateral to cover the shortfall.  Warbler Labs said it will backstop all losses to investors in the pool.  “This is disappointing and unexpected to say the least,” Warbler co-founders Michael Sall and Blake West wrote in the post. “Warbler Labs will take on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and we have decided to backstop losses related to REZI and POKT, excluding Warbler’s and Stratos’ positions.”  The remaining $13 million was allocated to e-commerce marketplace management startup Threecolts, which is “performing strongly,” the post noted.  The soured loan highlights the risks of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) such as private credit, which has become one of the latest trends in a crypto industry hungry for something to get excited about as capital inflows dried up. It also brings under scrutiny the due diligence process performed on blockchain-based RWA lending protocols, especially after last year’s string of defaulted loans to crypto trading firms.  The development followed another credit event of a Goldfinch pool earlier this year, when African motorcycle taxi financing company Tugende defaulted on a $5 million loan set to mature this October. The borrower also breached loan covenants by making intercompany loans to stem the financial struggles of a sister company, a Goldfinch governance post said.  “This is the second occurrence of a lack of transparency from a borrower or a lack of auditing capability from Goldfinch,” pseudonymous user Wiz said Saturday on the platform’s governance forum. “We can all appreciate that Warbler Labs will backstop the loss, but it is increasingly worrying to discover a complete lack of control from the loan underwriter, especially in the context of Stratos being an equity investor in Goldfinch.”  “There is a case of reputational risk,” another user named mans9841 commented under the forum post. The “RWA narrative has just started to ride and we cannot let ourselves down after building so much.”  CORRECTION (Oct. 11, 20:20 UTC): Warbler Labs said it was one of the ""backers"" and underwriters of the loan, not the pool manager and the underwriter as the earlier version said.

18572467,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554707,1696888846,"Bitcoin Halving Is 200 Days Away, This Happens Every Time: Is It Time To Doubledown?","Bitcoin is 200 days before halving, a supply shock that historical patterns show that prices tend to rally, even clearing previous all-time highs once it happens. In a price chart shared by the “thescalpingpro” on X on October 9, the analyst appears to suggest that the world’s most valuable coin is in the early stages of not only breaking above 2021 highs but registering new highs after the network halves in 2024. Early Signs Of Bull Rally: 200 Days Before Halving Thus far, the trader notes that Bitcoin is down 60% from previous all-time highs in 2021. This formation, the analyst says, appears to replicate the same pattern before Bitcoin halved in 2019. Then, just like it is presently, the coin fell 60% from 2017 highs of around $20,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu-Based BONE Gearing Up For Massive Rally, Here’s Why As historical pattern shows, Bitcoin prices tend to bounce back strongly after posting sharp losses from previous highs. These upswings are often accelerated by the halving event momentum, pushing prices further away from cyclical lows. Every four years, Bitcoin halving occurs, where the reward for mining a Bitcoin block is reduced by half. This feature is built into the protocol to slow the issuance of new Bitcoin. Due to the decrease in the number of coins released to circulation during halving, inflation is reduced, which supports prices, as previous price action has shown. Although the impact of halving has been well studied, the sequence of events preceding this event appears to be stirring demand. As aforementioned, 200 days before the 2016 and 2019 halvings, Bitcoin fell roughly 60% from all-time highs. The asset’s prices are at a similar price point precisely 200 days before halving. For this “near-perfect” replication of events, “thescalpingpro” is bullish that the coin might follow a familiar pattern of past cycles. Bitcoin Race To $48,000 Before Halving? The spike to all-time highs and beyond, as previewed, is a scenario that could happen once the halving happens. Before then, however, another analyst is convinced the coin could rally to $48,000. Related Reading: Time For Self-Custody? Crypto Exchange Reveals Hackers Tried To Gain Access 159,000 Times The analysis is based on crucial support and resistance levels formed by the Fibonacci retracement levels. The analyst is convinced that the coin will retest the 61.8% of the swing high low of the recent 2021 to 2022 range, placing Bitcoin at $48,000 once it recovers. The race to this level will be further driven by “halving momentum” and the “bear-to-bull transition from various indicators,” including the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and the on-balance volume of major exchanges, which appear oversold.

The company is “focused on extending our runway so that we have ample opportunity to pursue our Real-Time Observability thesis,” Cutler told CoinDesk in an email.  Blocknative, which was founded in 2018, now has 24 people in total, according to Cutler, implying about a dozen employees were affected.  The company raised $12 million in a funding round in July 2021 from Foundry Group, Blockchain Capital Robot Ventures and others, after raising $5 million in a seed round a year earlier, CoinDesk previously reported. Blocknative announced another $15 million investment round in December 2022.  “Taken together, these changes extend our runway to well over three years,” Cutler wrote in the email.  'Crypto winter'  The restructuring at Blocknative adds to job cuts in the blockchain industry that have accelerated in recent weeks with digital-asset markets seemingly stalled, including prices for bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum’s ether (ETH), and deepening the pall known as “crypto winter.”  Blocknative’s restructuring comes just a couple weeks after the company announced it would exit services related to its MEV-Boost Relay, a type of software used by Ethereum network validators, after the effort failed to ‘materialize’ economically.  Cutler said then that Blocknative would continue in other core services.

18570924,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554692,1696885232,Bitcoin And XRP Set To Shine: Shock $8 Trillion Predicted Amid US Dollar ‘Collapse’,"Despite initial expectations of a robust rally, major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP have encountered a slowdown in momentum following a promising start in 2023. However, a prominent tech company’s leaked disclosure can alter this trajectory. With the Federal Reserve (Fed) grappling with a staggering $33 trillion US “debt death spiral,” investment banking firm Jefferies analysts have warned that the Fed may be compelled to restart its money printing presses. This move could trigger the collapse of the US dollar and ignite a significant price boom for Bitcoin, rivaling the value of gold. Expert Advocates For Bitcoin As An Inflationary Safeguard A recent Forbes report indicates that Bitcoin’s highly anticipated halving event, expected to cause price volatility, is imminent. Christopher Wood, Jefferies’ global head of equity strategy, emphasized in a note to clients seen by CNBC that G7 central banks, including the Federal Reserve, are unlikely to withdraw from unconventional monetary policies smoothly. Notably, Wood considers Bitcoin and gold as “critical hedges” against the resurgence of inflation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trader Shares The “Only Chart” You Need To Profit From BTC In 2024 Since spring of 2022, the Federal Reserve embarked on reducing its ballooning balance sheet of nearly $9 trillion, which expanded significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic downturn. This process, known as quantitative tightening, involves draining liquidity from the financial system and shifting the burden of newly issued debt onto the private sector. US Dollar Caught In ‘Death Spiral’ In addition to balance sheet reductions, the Fed has implemented rapid interest rate hikes to rein in soaring inflation. However, this approach has raised concerns about a potential counterproductive “death spiral” for the US dollar, potentially bolstering the value of Bitcoin. Wood suggests that the Fed may be forced to adopt a more accommodating stance in response to a US recession. This shift would occur due to a larger-than-usual lag in the Fed’s interest rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation following the significant expansion of the money supply in 2020 and 2021. Wood further explains: Such a failure to exit from unorthodox monetary policy in a benign manner is likely to culminate in the collapse of the US dollar paper standard to the benefit of both gold bullion owners and also owners of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, along with Ethereum and XRP to a lesser extent, has witnessed a surge in institutional interest, driven by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock. The CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, who had previously expressed skepticism towards Bitcoin, made a notable shift in June. Fink’s endorsement of Bitcoin sparked a rush among Wall Street investors toward cryptocurrencies. With custodian arrangements in place for digital assets, Bitcoin has gained credibility as an investable option for institutional investors, presenting itself as an alternative store of value to gold. Related Reading: Shiba Inu-Based BONE Gearing Up For Massive Rally, Here’s Why In conclusion, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy challenges and the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have created a perfect storm, propelling their prices to new heights. Per the report, investors increasingly turn to digital currencies as potential hedges against inflation and storehouses of value as the US dollar faces uncertainty. When writing, the leading cryptocurrency in the market is trading at $27,300, reflecting a decrease of over 2% in the past 24 hours. This decline follows an overall downtrend in the market since the beginning of the new trading week. Notwithstanding the recent drop, BTC is positioned above its critical 50-day and 200-day Moving Averages (MAs). This favorable positioning may support a rebound in the cryptocurrency’s value and prevent further decline, helping it maintain the crucial $27,000 milestone.

42392363,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5nqj,1696884974,What to Expect When Caroline Ellison Takes Stand in Sam Bankman-Fried's Trial,"Caroline Ellison, the former Alameda Research CEO and ex-girlfriend of Sam Bankman-Fried – and the star witness in the government’s case against the disgraced crypto wunderkind – will begin her testimony on Tuesday. It’s expected to be the most consequential day of testimony yet in Bankman-Fried’s high-stakes criminal trial.  A 28-year-old Stanford grad whose on-and-off-again romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried spanned several years, Ellison was the CEO of Alameda Research – the crypto trading firm established by Bankman-Fried – as it allegedly received $8 billion in misappropriated FTX user funds.  When lawyers kicked off their opening arguments on Oct. 4, no one other than Bankman-Fried himself featured more prominently than Ellison.  When Ellison was CEO, Bankman-Fried “was using her as a front,” U.S. Attorney Thane Rehn told the jury last week. “In reality, he was still calling the shots at Alameda, and he came up with a scheme to take money from FTX and give it to Alameda.” As for what to expect from her testimony, Rehn told the jury that Ellison would “tell you about how she and the defendant stole the money that customers entrusted to FTX and used it to make investments through Alameda.”  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried’s Closest Friends Will Testify Against Him. Here’s Who Else We’ll Hear From  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers, in turn, have suggested Ellison may be the real responsible party for Alameda’s collapse, painting a picture where he, occupied with running FTX and his other tasks, delegated his trading firm’s operations to his handpicked lieutenant.  During cross-examination they may grill her on her managerial decisions.  Ellison was far from an unwitting front-person during her time at Alameda, said Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s lead attorney, in his opening argument in defense of Bankman-Fried. Instead, she was firmly in control of the reins at the trading fund – and her poor leadership, according to Bankman-Fried’s lawyers, is what ultimately placed the firm into dire financial straits. At one point, “as the majority owner of Alameda, [Bankman-Fried] spoke to Ms. Ellison, the CEO, and he urged her to put on a hedge,” Cohen told the jury. “She didn't do so at the time,” but if she had followed Bankman-Fried’s advice, she “would have offset some of this.”  Other court filings suggest Cohen and his team may seek to try to discredit – to an extent – Ellison as a witness by emphasizing that she is cooperating with prosecutors in hopes of a lighter sentence and by leaving open a door to cross-examine her about possible recreational drug use.  A witness's recreational drug use might affect his or her recollections, defense attorneys wrote in a filing, and “drug use that impaired an employee’s performance of duties in a manner that could have affected the accuracy of company records or the reliability of contemporaneous statements may also be relevant not just to credibility but also to important factual issues.”  While defense attorneys didn't say they were specifically referencing Ellison, she has famously tweeted about using amphetamines.  Origins  Bankman-Fried established Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency trading firm, years before founding FTX, the crypto exchange platform that imploded in November 2022. He ran it for a time, before handing control over to Ellison and Sam Trabucco, who operated the company as co-CEOs until August 2022. Trabucco resigned, and Ellison took over as sole CEO.  The two companies were supposed to operate separately. Last week, however, former FTX Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang testified that the exchange “gave special privileges to Alameda Research on FTX which allowed it to withdraw unlimited amounts of funds from the platform, and we lied about this to the public.”  Prosecutors say that Bankman-Fried – with cooperation from Ellison and a small cadre of insiders – secretly used these special privileges to siphon FTX user deposits into Alameda, and subsequently lost that money through a series of crypto gambles, venture investments, political donations, personal expenditures and other transactions.  Altogether, approximately $8 billion of FTX user money landed in Alameda’s coffers while Ellison was serving as the trading firm’s head, witnesses said in court. It remains unclear how much money will ultimately be recoverable for FTX’s creditors.  Ellison has been expected to testify against Bankman-Fried since December 2022, when she pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and five counts of conspiracy. Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the trial, revoked Bankman-Fried’s bail after prosecutors accused him of leaking Ellison’s personal diaries to The New York Times this past summer – a move that Kaplan said amounted to witness tampering.  Ellison’s plea agreement waived her of any charges except criminal tax violations, provided she fully cooperated with the U.S. Attorney's office.  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

Stocks have reached oversold levels, but are not considered investable. However, there may be potential for high return swing trades. The earnings of crypto mining businesses are correlated to the market prices of Bitcoin, and the industry is currently not profitable. This article will compare, from a technical perspective, a few of the crypto mining stocks we follow closely at Crypto Waves. Specifically, we will take a look at (RIOT), (MARA), (CIFR), (CLSK), (HUT), (BITF), (HIVE), and (BTBT). Since the summer highs, stock prices in the above list have lost between 56%-64% of their value from peak to (current) trough, in under three months! In roughly the same time frame, BTC has dropped 21.75% (from peak to (current) trough). From a technical standpoint observing key oscillators, this class of stocks has reached very oversold levels, but are they investable? In our view on that matter, no. However, that does not mean the same as us ruling out the prospect of some very high return swing trades developing to the upside. In their current patterns, we view upside trades as quite speculative but we will lay out conditions for a prospective more attractive upside setup in a few of the miners. The business of crypto mining is essentially companies hoping to capture the surplus value from generating newly minted coins vs. the cost of “mining” the block, which would convey to the “miner” newly minted coins as a reward. The costs consist of investment in capital expenditure in “Mining Rigs,” which are dedicated computer systems designed to perform the complex calculations required for mining. These rigs consist of multiple high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that can handle the intense computational workload. The main operating cost is the power required to perform the computational workload. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) undergoes a halving cycle roughly every four years. The event is referred to as a “halving” because when it takes place, the reward for each block mined is reduced to half of what it was preceding the event. The next expected halving is roughly six months away. Though we will not provide a deep dive into performance metrics of this industry, at the current BTC price and mining reward, this is not a profitable industry. Much like precious metals miners, the earnings of these crypto mining businesses are strongly correlated to market prices in the underlying commodity being mined, in this case, we are primarily talking about Bitcoin. Our thesis on BTC remains bullish. Fibonacci support ranges down to the $20k region, and so long as no sustained or meaningful break below this region develops, our confident expectation is for BTC to climb to the $40k-$49k region. Though I have less conviction about BTC moving directly above the 2021 high, and into $100k+ territory, without any breaks below the 2022 low, a technical setup has emerged for this prospect. That said, while the thesis in BTC is more confidently bullish, especially in the long run, in which we do have strong conviction about moves well north of $100k, we can’t convey a strong investment grade thesis for the miners. From a technical standpoint, though most miners had enormous gains from the pandemic lows into all-time highs and have held higher lows in the retrace into last year’s low, the patterns do not convey any confident prospect of reaching new all-time highs. Similarly, though the bounces from the 2022 lows into this year’s high have produced staggering gains, the patterns do not convey a confident prospect of exceeding the 2023 highs, let alone all-time highs. The only positive aspects to report are that: the charts are very oversold (but certainly can continue to become more oversold) and (more importantly) some of these charts are displaying very corrective patterns in their declines off the 2023 highs. This is suggestive of these securities prospectively holding a higher low (above the 2022 low) and forming another rally segment to exceed the 2023 highs but without confidence to reach or exceed the all-time highs. In the group with corrective decline patterns are the following tickers: MARA and CIFR. On the other hand, there are RIOT, HIVE, and BTBT. These all appear to have formed impulses from the summer highs which is very challenging to a prospective sustained bullish thesis, beyond a dead cat bounce. What’s particularly peculiar with RIOT and BTBT is that, while these have retraced considerably less of their rallies from last year’s low (while their patterns are most suggestive of downside follow-through), which sends a mixed message of sorts. Of the remaining names mentioned near the heading of the article, HUT and BITF have patterns that appear to favor general downside continuation (with some corrective bounces) but that are less clearly impulsive to the downside. BITF possibly has 5 waves down already, but another corrective bounce followed by a lower low would make that pattern significantly more resolute (see below). Lastly, we have CLSK. CLSK still has just three waves down from this summer’s high but is developing a potential impulse to the downside. Nevertheless, if price maintains above the 61.8% Fibonacci retrace and takes out some key resistance, a setup to the upside for considerable gains should not yet be ruled out. Regarding all of the aforementioned names: Every single one is still maintaining its 61.8% retracement of the rally from the 2022 low into the summer 2023 highs (See charts below). So long as price is above those key levels, I can’t get strongly bearish. However, I do want to distinguish between those that are currently providing stronger signals of caution (RIOT, HIVE, and BTBT) and those that are better candidates, from an Elliott Wave perspective, for bigger bull runs in late 2023 and early 2024 (MARA and CIFR). In summary, in the current posture, MARA and CIFR appear the least bad, even though MARA’s retrace is towards the larger end of the spectrum. All that said, a corrective decline is not sufficient, in our view, to start speculating with some positive expected value on the long side. What will be needed are micro impulsive rallies through resistance. Below we will review in detail some general conditions regarding price fluctuations in the coming weeks that would enable bullish setups to develop in MARA and CIFR. Though we’re skeptical about CLSK we have included it as well as the bullish potential is still intact albeit more farfetched. MARA (Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc.) From the low near the end of 2022 to the 2023 high, MARA stock gained 540% and is currently (as of this writing) up 160%. From an Elliott Wave pattern perspective, MARA is interpreted to be forming a larger corrective move, in which the initial portion completed into the summer highs. The correction since then appears to be forming a higher low to set up a move to $32+ to test the March 2022 high. (Shown with the black labels on the accompanying chart) As stated above, this is not a high confidence forecast (yet), but should price maintain support in a corrective decline and then develop impulsively to the upside from above $5~, a move to $32 is the preferred interpretation. The alternative thesis (displayed in red) is that price has completed its corrective bounce off the 2022 low and is starting a larger decline to under $2. At a micro level, a move meaningfully over $9.70 is needed to establish at least a temporary low in place. That said, Fibonacci resistance for downside continuation sits between $10-$11.10. Ultimately, to become more confidently bullish from the current low, we’ll need to see a 5 wave rally up through the late August high of $14. Should such a move develop, I would consider pullbacks possible buying opportunities for a rally to $32-plus. Key levels to watch, should price decline further, are $6.32, which is the key Fibonacci 61.8% retrace, and $5.13, which is the March temporary low from which price launched. Sustained breaks below these levels reduce odds of upside continuation as per the black count. Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) CIFR (Cipher Mining Inc.) Cipher has so far produced the most shallow retrace of the bunch. From the low near the end of 2022 to the 2023 high, CIFR stock gained 1288% and is currently (as of writing) up 600% from the 2022 low. From a technical perspective (displayed in the black-lettered labels in the accompanying chart), Cipher appears to be forming a larger bounce in which the initial portion completed into the summer highs and with price pulling back correctively to form a higher low. Thus far, CIFR has retraced the least of its rally in the first half of the year, not yet having reached the key 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. It’s reasonably likely that while price remains below $3.15, CIFR can see further extension downward into key confluence support in the $1.25-$1.80 region. That said, so long as price does not make a sustained break below $1, a rally back up to test near the all-time high at $15.39 looks like a viable prospect. All that said, for a confident set up to trade to the long side, traders will want to see a price turn up impulsively from the Fibonacci support region (roughly $1-$1.95) and take out some resistance. Considering that this decline from the July high still appears incomplete, we do not yet have key resistance levels to take out to establish a prospective low in place. Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) CLSK (CleanSpark, Inc.) From the low near the end of 2022 to the 2023 high, CLSK stock gained 340% and is currently (as of writing) up 115%. The action counts best as 3 waves up which does not provide a high confidence prospect for upwards continuation. However, so far CLSK only has three waves down into Fibonacci support, which keeps alive the potential for another segment up to form a larger corrective move. Specifically, this entails a large degree 3 wave move in which the initial wave completed into the summer highs and price forming a higher low to set up a move to around $14 to test the March 2022 high. (This prospective path is displayed in black on the accompanying chart.) As stated above, this is not a high confidence forecast (yet), but should price maintain support in a corrective decline and then develop impulsively to the upside from above $3~, a move to $14 ($13.91) is the preferred scenario though we should note this is even more speculative than with MARA. The alternative thesis (displayed in red) is that price has completed its corrective bounce off the 2022 low and is starting a larger decline to under $1. Though the broad strokes appear set up like MARA, CLSK is in a more concerning posture. Though the decline down from the July high is still just three waves, the move is setting up more impulsively to the downside which is cause for concern to those entertaining a possible trade to the upside. On the micro level, it’s reasonable that the bounce from last week’s low continues higher and $4-$4.20 is the resistance region to watch. Should price rally correctively to resistance and then produce a lower low under $2.85, price will have a 5 wave impulsive decline from the summer highs, which suggests downside continuation as per the red count to become the favored perspective. For the bullish case to assert itself, ideally, the low is in or perhaps one more low early this week that maintains the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement around $3 ($3.07). For a more advantageous long side setup, we will want to see an impulsive rally that resoundingly exceeds $4.33 with follow through above $5.45. At that point we’d see pullbacks as potential buying opportunities for a more reasonable prospective rally to $14.

18569152,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554666,1696881624,These Bullish Factors Prove XRP Price Rally Is Not Over Yet,"The XRP price has retraced a good portion of its gains following its surge above $0.54 last week. Naturally, this could signal that the end is in sight for an XRP rally but this is not necessarily the case when you look at the altcoin’s metrics and performance even amid its price decline. XRP Daily Transaction Count Remains Above 1 Million The XRP daily transaction count first skyrocketed above 1 million back in July when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that programmatic XRP sales did not constitute investment contracts. The XRP price had rallied more than 60% as a result of this and daily transaction counts shot up as well. By the time August rolled around, XRP’s daily transaction counts had surpassed that of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the network has not slowed down since. Looking at data from BitInfoCharts, XRP is still maintaining its more than 1 million transactions per day numbers. Daily transaction count remains above 1 million | Source: BitInfoCharts Since the start of October, the altcoin’s daily transaction figures have also come out consistently above that of Bitcoin and Ethereum, showing that interest in the network has not diminished. XRP Ledger Crosses 83 Million Blocks As transaction counts have been on the high side, block production on the XRP Ledger also shows active participation from users. Late last week, the blockchain marked its 83 millionth block. Related Reading: 39-Month Cycle Says XRP Price Is Poised For Breakout To $1,000, Here’s When This was confirmed by the XRPScan account on X (formerly Twitter), coming less than two months after the Ledger marked its 82 millionth block.

Additionally, there have been 392,000 transactions and rising, with an average Transaction Per Second (TPS) of 20 TPS. XRP sees rocky start to the new week | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Daily Trading Volume Jumps 56% Another major factor that could point to the XRP price rally not being over is the jump in daily trade volume. Between Sunday and Monday, the XRP daily trading volume rose more than 56% to reach approximately $480 million. This follows a jump above $500 million previously before the cool-down. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Data To Prove That XRP Is Deflationary Just like other factors listed above, the jump in trading volume suggests rising interest. Given that the XRP price has not been in free fall, it could point to the volume being skewed more toward buying rather than selling. In such a case, a rally is more likely to ensue. XRP Price Rally Could Continue Despite the XRP price falling to bearish pressure over the last few days, it could quickly recover as metrics continue to flash bullish. As one crypto analyst points out, the XRP price is reaching the point in its 39-month cycle where it could bounce toward another rally. For the top of this rally, the analyst puts the price at $1,000. Currently, the XRP price is sitting at $0.5141, registering a 1.49% loss in the last 24 hours.

42392374,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5og1,1696879208,Digital Asset Recap Q3 2023: Bitcoin and Ether Outperform Wider Market Amid Regulatory Pressure and the Promise of ETFs,"Over the past quarter, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization, declined -11%. Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed the broad benchmark by declining -10.9% while ether (ETH) underperformed, posting a loss of -12.5% for the last 3 months.  It's helpful to view these numbers in the context of their year-to-date performance, where Bitcoin has gained an impressive 64%, and Ether has risen by 41%. This underscores the resilience of these cryptocurrencies as some of the top-performing assets in 2023. This quarterly outperformance of BTC versus ETH and the broader CMI is a continuation of a trend we’ve seen throughout the year. Institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to support BTC, while the continued regulatory pressure on alternative tokens drives the bifurcation in the crypto market between the established majors (Bitcoin and Ether) and other digital asset protocols and projects.  Sector-by-sector  Looking within sector quarterly performance with the CoinDesk DACS framework, the trends and preferences towards larger capitalization tokens are less clear. Over Q3 of 2023, Computing (CPU, +3%) and DeFi sectors (DCF, -8%) were relative out-performers, while Smart Contract Platform (SMT, -13%), which contains Ether, and Culture and Entertainment (CNE, -22%) were relative under-performers. See the chart below for a full sector performance breakdown for Q3 of 2023.  News related to U.S. regulation was a key driver of price movements this quarter, with SEC actions featuring prominently in this. This followed regulatory enforcement action against Coinbase and Binance earlier in June. Meanwhile, regulatory filings for spot ETFs by some of the world's largest asset managers introduced a lot of price action ahead of potential approval dates.  While July and August were relatively muted months for the market, September saw the outperformance of DeFi, Digitization and the Computing sector off the back of the partial Ripple court case win earlier in the month, and investor enthusiasm for AI, which propelled Chainlink (LINK), an on-chain data provider and the largest token of the Computing sector, to rise 24% for the month.  September also marked the one-year anniversary of Ethereum’s successful transition to a “Proof-of-Stake” consensus mechanism. This reduces the amount of computational work needed to verify blocks and transactions, effectively eliminating its carbon footprint. So far, the network has been operating as intended with staking assets becoming a popular way for crypto investors to enhance returns. CoinDesk Indices Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR), a metric used to proxy the expected income from Ethereum staking activities, averaged 4% (annualized) over the quarterly period, trending lower to end September at 3.6%.  One significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape in this quarter is the reduced level of risk, as defined by standard risk measures. We are now seeing lower levels of volatility, decreased correlation with traditional equities, and slightly reduced correlation among the top-30 tokens, as shown below.     This shift could be an indication of a maturation of the market, as investors are becoming more discerning across token sectors, or it could be an artifact of market illiquidity, as trading volumes continue to decrease across large cryptocurrency exchanges.  Where next?  Bond yields are rising sharply off of a relatively hawkish September FOMC, where the summary of economic projections (i.e. “the dot plot”) eliminated the expectation for interest rate cuts in the near term. This dot plot guidance allowed the Federal Reserve to be clearer and more concise in indicating to the market that interest rates would have to be held higher for longer. While rising interest rates haven’t immediately impacted the price of digital assets, the tightening of financial conditions and strengthening of the U.S. dollar should be expected to add further headwinds to the price appreciation for crypto currencies. Coincidentally, the CoinDesk Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators have registered neutral to slightly negative trend signals over the first few days of Q4.  A catalyst to break through the macroeconomic headwinds of tightening financial conditions could come in the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF.  Why?  Firstly, it would greatly enhance accessibility, allowing a broader range of investors to easily gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct purchase and storage, like how gold ETFs, starting in the early-2000s, simplified the process of gaining exposure to physical gold. This in turn could shift and diversify the investor base in cryptocurrencies, from tech-savvy enthusiasts to more mainstream, longer-term investors seeking diversification, which could result in a reduction in volatility across the digital asset market.  Additionally, the ETF structure would facilitate easier institutional adoption, delegating asset acquisition and storage to qualified custodians, making it more familiar and regulated for institutional investors like hedge funds and pension funds.  Finally, a Bitcoin ETF will allow investors to allocate a portion of their assets to Bitcoin as a store of value or an uncorrelated asset class. This could result in a significant influx of capital into the cryptocurrency market, marking the maturation of Bitcoin from a niche asset class to a regulated and accepted part of the traditional financial system.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/10/09/digital-asset-recap-q3-2023-bitcoin-and-ether-outperform-wider-market-amid-regulatory-pressure-and-the-promise-of-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/828b7aa229a7c942f15f3d1baf5ca05f7258a9ee-1024x697.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, seasoned traders are being urged to exercise caution as they navigate their positions in this dynamic landscape. Recent developments surrounding a long-standing BNB holder have brought the coin into the spotlight once again, shedding light on its remarkable journey. A noteworthy event in the BNB ecosystem unveiled itself when one of the early adopters and staunch proponents of BNB decided to make a move. This dedicated holder recently sent a staggering $1.48 million worth of BNB to the Binance exchange, signaling a momentous decision. What makes this action all the more intriguing is the jaw-dropping profit it yielded—an astonishing $54 million on the sale, as disclosed by Lookonchain. An early $BNB holder deposited 7,005 $BNB ($1.48M) to #Binance again today. The early holder has a profit of more than $54M on $BNB and currently has 5,447 $BNB ($1.15M) left.https://t.co/JzcPPKtog1 pic.twitter.com/k2B6IKF2RO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 8, 2023 Related Reading: XRP Journey To $0.55: Is A Breakthrough Imminent In The Coming Days? Crypto’s Journey To The Present The historical context of this holder’s involvement with BNB adds depth to the narrative. In 2018, they deposited a substantial 500,543 BNB into Binance when the coin was valued at $112 per unit, amounting to a staggering $56 million. Surprisingly, this significant sale did not trigger a massive plunge in the coin’s market value, indicating its resilience amidst such significant transactions. As of the latest available data, CoinGecko reports BNB’s price at $210.27, with a modest 0.5% decline over the past 24 hours and a 4.3% dip in the past week. BNB market cap currently at $32 billion. Chart: TradingView.com An analysis of the BNB/USD 4-hour chart by a BNB price report suggests a stabilization of BNB’s volatility, which could result in fewer pronounced price fluctuations. Notably, neither the upper nor lower Bollinger Bands touched the BNB price at $211, signifying that the coin was not in an overbought or oversold state. Traders are eagerly awaiting a change in market sentiment to capitalize on potential profits. The Road Ahead For BNB Adding to the mix of indicators is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which currently stands at 0.1, indicating bullish momentum for BNB. However, a closer look reveals that the 12-day and 26-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are positioned below the zero histogram point and in close proximity to each other. This suggests a lack of clear direction for BNB, with buyers and sellers nearly evenly matched. As a result, the crypto is likely to consolidate within the range of $210 to $215 in the short term.

Some $105 million of long positions – traders who bet that prices would rise – were wiped out as of the U.S. afternoon, CoinGlass data shows. This was the largest amount of long liquidations in a day since Sept. 11.  The liquidations happened as crypto prices tumbled as the fight between Israel and Hamas and rising turmoil in the region jolted investors, weighing on risk assets. The largest digital asset, bitcoin [BTC], was down over 2% before climbing back to $27,600. At one point, ether [ETH] slid almost 5% and large-cap cryptocurrencies solana [SOL], Polygon’s native token [MATIC] and Polkadot’s [DOT] endured 6% to 7% declines. They rebounded some later.  Liquidations occur when an exchange closes a leveraged trading position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial money down, or ""margin,"" because the trader fails to meet the margin requirements or doesn't have enough funds to keep the position open.  ETH derivatives traders took the brunt of the losses, as falling prices spurred $32.78 million of longs liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass. The largest single liquidation order was a $4.5 million ETH-BUSD long on crypto exchange Binance.

18565675,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554650,1696874404,"$29,700 Could Be The Next Big Level To Claim For Bitcoin, Here’s Why","On-chain data shows the true market mean price of Bitcoin is valued at $29,700 right now, making the level of particular significance for the coin. Bitcoin True Market Mean Price Is At $29,700 Currently In a new post on X, the lead on-chain analyst at the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, “Checkmate,” pointed out how the BTC price currently trades below the true market cost basis. The “market cost basis” refers to the average price at which the investors in the sector bought their coins. One popular way of calculating this cost basis is through the “realized cap,” which measures the total value of the cryptocurrency by assuming that the price at which each coin on the blockchain was last transferred is its true value. When this capitalization model is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the “realized price” is obtained, which is the average cost basis of the supply. Related Reading: These Bitcoin Holders Have Bought Almost $2 Billion In Last 6 Weeks: Data However, this method has some issues, such as a chunk of the circulating Bitcoin supply being permanently inaccessible (due to wallet keys becoming lost). A lot of this inactive supply would have traded long ago, meaning its cost basis would be shallow compared to today’s prices. Thus, if included in the metric, it would skew its value away from reality. Checkmate and Ark Invest’s David Puell came up with “Cointime Economics” a while back, a new methodology that tackles the problems with the realized price. “Cointime Economics introduces a simplified framework to efficiently discount the impact of lost supply and amplify economic impacts on the truly active supply,” explains Glassnode. The chart below shows the trend in the “true market mean price” for Bitcoin, as calculated by this advanced model. Looks like the spot price of the asset is currently below this line | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X Based on this more accurate model, Bitcoin currently has a true mean price of $29,700. Therefore, the asset’s spot price is trading well below this level. The graph shows that significant breaks above this indicator have historically resulted in the cryptocurrency enjoying some sustained bullish momentum. Checkmate has also attached the “AVIV Ratio Z-Score” data in the same chart. The “AVIV Ratio” tracks the deviation from the true market mean that BTC is currently observing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes Another Attempt At $28,000, Can Break Happen? The Glassnode lead notes that this indicator is the most accurate measure of the market centroid for Bitcoin. At the current value, the metric is “still -0.6 standard deviations below its long-term mean,” according to the analyst. The near-term outcome of the price based on this is uncertain, but in the long term, Bitcoin could see a reversion back to its mean, thus making the current price levels potentially profitable buying points. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $27,500, down 3% in the last week.

The organization will host a multi-signature wallet – controlled jointly by multiple parties – to collect donations denominated in multiple cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as well as the dollar-linked stablecoins USDT and USDC, according to a press release from Crypto Aid Israel.  Numerous Israeli banks and regulators have stepped in to assist with the flow of these crypto donations. According to a source close to the initiative, for the first time, these banks will most likely provide a bridge to move those crypto assets to the banks.  Fireblocks, a crypto safekeeping specialist firm, has stepped in to manage those crypto assets, according to a press release.  “A strict policy has been implemented that requires at least of four out of seven signatories to move funds out of the wallet,” Crypto Aid Israel said.  A couple of members of the alliance so far include Fireblocks as well as MarketAcross, Collider Ventures, CryptoJungle and Israel Blockchain Association.

42392370,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5oGN,1696872173,Crypto Should Ghost the SBF Trial,"This promises to be a month of reckoning in the world of crypto as Sam Bankman-Fried, the former cargo-clad-golden-geek turned alleged crypto-hustling fraudster, appears in court to face conspiracy and fraud charges. With the media spotlight firmly fixed on the unfolding courtroom drama, there’s a real risk that legitimate crypto businesses will be tempted to weigh in on deception and bad actors rather than focusing on their customers and business strategy.  Katherine Snow is the Head of Legal at Messari, the leading market intelligence platform for the crypto economy, where she drives policy and legal strategy in key jurisdictions worldwide.  Bankman-Fried’s trial is igniting a media spectacle – from FTX’s customers and investors suffering staggering losses, to his own swift ascent and descent as the world’s youngest billionaire, and the scandalous whispers of drug-fueled Bahamian benders and polyamory. Piling on will be at least eight Hollywood projects, affiliated books (*cough* Michael Lewis), and podcasts about FTX that have been waiting in the wings for this moment. The frenzy promises to surpass even the recent, meme-fueled Gwyneth Paltrow ski case or the Depp vs. Herd spectacle.  Meanwhile, against all odds, the industry has begun to find its footing in a wary Washington, and the kick-off of the trial risks new headwinds. Instead of playing into the distraction, it must not allow the actions of Bankman-Fried to tarnish the good faith work of the sector to advance common sense regulation.  The crypto industry has rapidly shifted from the periphery to the forefront in D.C. in a remarkably brief span. The sector has established a host of trade associations, think tanks, and political action committees, enlisted a significant cadre of seasoned lobbyists, and formed in-house policy teams. These initiatives have attracted the attention and engagement of policymakers and regulators, underscoring the undeniable promise of blockchain technology and the passion of its proponents.  This advocacy culminated in a remarkable “crypto summer” in June, with four promising regulatory bills successfully voted out of a Congressional committee for the first time. While this is an incredible milestone, unveiling glimmers of regulatory certainty, the journey to enacting any of these bills into law remains formidable.  This is a turning point. The industry can’t afford to let the Bankman-Fried trial divert its focus. The crypto community must recognize the gravity of the moment and respond decisively. It’s a rallying cry for all industry players – developers, protocols, investors, startups, and established firms alike.  It’s crucial for the industry to disassociate from rogue actors and showcase its dedication to ethical conduct and responsible practices. The crypto community has proven its capability to do exactly that. Swift reactions to regulatory hurdles, active initiatives to educate lawmakers, and a readiness for constructive discussions all reflect the industry's maturity and promise. However, the crypto industry risks erasing these achievements if it lets the Bankman-Fried saga dominate the narrative.  So, as the trial unfolds and the world watches, the industry must ignore the sensationalism and get back to business. The shot clock for progress in D.C. in 2023 is ticking ever closer to zero and every stakeholder in the crypto ecosystem should be hustling to amplify its collective voice in Washington. The crypto industry must continue to show the U.S. legislature that, beyond the outliers, blockchain technology is tangible and worth championing.  The goal is clear: to establish a regulatory environment that fosters innovation, protects consumers, developers, and innovators while ensuring that the United States remains a player in the Web3 revolution. And to Washington policymakers: delve deeper than the headlines. America’s hegemonic power is at stake, and you play a pivotal role in protecting our digital future.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Katherine Snow,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/09/crypto-should-ghost-the-sbf-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c02fe3dc4847438cb475cba777bac4c7974b1b1-2048x1023.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Trust Wallet Extension update on Chrome might be driving its price gains in the past week. Due to the update, users can now enjoy the full features of Trust Wallet integrated with their Chrome browser. Such ease of access may have boosted the use of TWT, thereby pushing its demand and price. Recent Network-Related Developments Can Push TWT’s Price Further The new Trust Wallet Extension update (V 1.9.1) on Chrome Store was announced on October 3. According to the announcement, users can enjoy native EVM swaps, Ledger and hardware support, and crypto purchases. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Ready For Blast-Off As Key Metrics Signal A Bull Run: Top Analyst Users can now access 15 different staking options across nine blockchains with the extension. This additional utility is likely driving more investors to the Trust Wallet ecosystem. Also, on October 5, Trust Wallet launched a Trust Wallet Testimonial Contest to reward its loyal community. According to a blog post, participants will share their testimonials and experiences using Trust Wallet. Trust Wallet will reward five lucky winners with mystery swag boxes once they complete certain tasks. This contest will likely boost investors’ interest in the ecosystem and lead to price gains for TWT tokens. TWT Declining On Daily Chart Despite Weekly Gains Despite impressive weekly gains, TWT shows signs of price decline on the daily chart. Its decline could correlate to the retracement in BTC’s price from $28,000 to $27,770 today, October 9, at 5:36 am EST. After its rally from the $0.79 support level, TWT broke above the $0.94 resistance level. Looking at the daily chart, TWT has formed two consecutive red candles on the daily chart, confirming increased selling pressure. Also, today’s candle drops below the trendline, hinting at a slight retracement ahead for the token. TWT is retracing in the Donchian Channel (DC) and approaching the Median Band. A drop below this band will confirm that the sellers have reclaimed dominance on its price. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator displays a value of 64.5 in the buy zone close to 70. A close look at this indicator and its downward motion reveals that it is retracing from the overbought zone. The RSI’s movement confirms the sentiment that the buyers are beginning to take profit and close long positions. Related Reading: Binance CEO Foresees Monumental Bitcoin Price Shift Following Halving Nevertheless, the price retracement for TWT will likely be brief due to its ecosystem developments. The daily chart analysis shows that TWT will likely decline to $0.94 in the next few days before resuming its rally. Also, the next rally may likely send TWT above the $1 resistance zone for more impressive gains. However, buyers must avoid bull traps if the $0.94 support level fails to hold.

According to data from IntoTheBlock, whales of BONE tokens have boosted their holdings in the past month to increase their concentration of the ecosystem to over 43%. Whale Wallets Loading Up On BONE In Anticipation Of A Rally BONE (Shibaswap) is one of the most important tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem and has done well since the launch of Shibarium, as the token went on a bullish trend to reach $1.70 in August. Since then, things have cooled down in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and the token has lost most of this gain. Related Reading: Dogecoin In A Dire Position As Daily Active Addresses Drop Drastically At the time of writing, BONE is trading at $0.7813, has a market cap of $195 million, and a max supply of 230,003,023 BONE tokens.

A similar metric following the movement of BONE tokens has shown that the concentration of these tokens in whale addresses (wallets holding more than 1% of the total supply) has increased by +19.74% in the past 30 days. On the other hand, concentration in investor addresses (wallets holding between 0.1% and 1% of the total supply) has reduced by 1.37% in the past 30 days. BONE holder concentration | Source: IntoTheBlock Recent Price Action Shows Bullish Momentum Might Be Building BONE is currently trending downward after having a bullish run since Shibarium’s introduction. Data has also shown only 34% of holders are making money at the current price. However, the increase in large wallet holdings of BONE coupled with a 33.48% increase in the past 24-hour trading volume is a bullish reversal signal, as it can increase buying pressure from retail investors.

42392360,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5nR5,1696865250,Bitstamp Courts European Banks as Region's Incoming Crypto Rules Boost Confidence,"Crypto exchange Bitstamp is in talks with several big European banks about offering cryptocurrency services.  This suggests the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA, regime is helping TradFi banks get comfortable with digital assets.  In the U.S., the opposite seems to be true as regulators go after crypto.  Bitstamp, the longest-running cryptocurrency exchange, says it’s in talks to help three large European banks begin offering crypto services around the first quarter of next year.  The news, revealed by a senior executive during an interview with CoinDesk, suggests the European Union’s major crypto regulatory effort, called Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA, is easing the way for conventional financial firms to get into digital assets.  That’s a stark contrast with the U.S., where regulators are cracking down, thus keeping old-school firms hesitant and forcing crypto companies to consider moving elsewhere.  Bitstamp has gotten a lot of interest in Europe for the exchange’s relatively new Bitstamp-as-a-service offering, a white-label licensing and technology combo designed to help banks and fintech firms offer crypto buying and selling, said Robert Zagotta, the Luxembourg-based company’s global chief commercial officer and CEO of its U.S. division.  “In the last six to nine months, we’ve had quite an increase in inbound inquiries about this offering from large European banks,” Zagotta said in an interview. “We are in advanced conversations with three such banks, household name banks in Europe. I think first quarter-ish we will be able to announce.” He didn’t identify the firms.  Unfortunately, the reverse is happening in the U.S., Zagotta said. There, some large, regulated firms are moving their crypto operations elsewhere, to places like Singapore.  While the U.S. clamps down on crypto, places like Europe have been busy getting rules in place and traditional financial institutions are now partnering and formulating strategies, with big players like Deutsche Bank and HSBC in the news.  Bitstamp, which was granted a BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services in 2019 and is audited by EY, has also seen demand for a fully regulated perpetual swap product in Europe, and the exchange has been working on this, Zagotta said.  Not another FTX  Zagotta believes Bitstamp’s buttoned-up approach to regulation and governance is now reaping rewards in the wake of FTX’s collapse and some of the regulatory challenges faced by crypto exchange giant Binance.  Bitstamp onboarded about 36% more corporations in the first half of 2023 versus the second half of 2022, partly a result of FTX evaporating in November and its market share being redistributed, Zagotta said.  But the crypto industry can ill afford another blow-up like FTX, Zagotta added, pointing to the possibility of another large player such as Binance being brought down in some way or other.  “If Binance were to go down, the disruption in the marketplace would be just enormous,” Zagotta said. “So we don’t wish for them to literally go down in flames like FTX. We just are hopeful that there’s a level playing field across all of us. I think we’ll get there.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/09/bitstamp-courts-european-banks-as-regions-incoming-crypto-rules-boost-confidence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d94c5d8ad3c18b13f2355e9ac965e9af6ab31ac0-825x551.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cipollone, who has been the Bank of Italy’s deputy governor since 2020, is the sole candidate to replace crypto skeptic Panetta when he steps down from the central bank's executive board in November. Cipollone's Monday remarks suggest he won’t stray far from existing ECB digital currency policies.  A digital euro would “reinforce the ability to pay with public money throughout Europe with a technology and infrastructure that is based in Europe,” he told members of the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, promising offline functionality, accessibility and “excellent solutions” to protect privacy.  Cipollone’s eight-year term has already been approved by eurozone finance ministers and the ECB itself, making his ascension to the position all but certain. Lawmakers also favored his candidacy 30-3 in a non-binding vote held shortly after the debate.  Panetta has previously railed against private crypto as a greed-fueled Ponzi scheme and has also led ECB work on a digital euro, despite significant lawmaker skepticism about the benefits of the project for retail users.  In a response to an earlier written questionnaire from lawmakers, Cipollone said that blockchain innovations bring “significant risks,” but that the challenges of a CBDC for financial stability and lending could be managed through measures like imposing holding limits on citizens.  In a recent letter seen by CoinDesk, a group of cross-party EU lawmakers asked the ECB to postpone any decisions on a retail CBDC until they can agree on legal constraints in controversial areas such as privacy.

The selling pressure could push BTC back to critical support levels unless buyers can stop the current price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Ready For Blast-Off As Key Metrics Signal A Bull Run: Top Analyst As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $27,400 with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency recorded a 3% loss as the rest of the crypto top 10 by market cap moves in a similar direction. The One Bitcoin Chart For Success? Crypto analyst and trader Rekt Capital shared a thesis supported on the upcoming Bitcoin Halving. This event was designed to halve the rewards miners granted to include new blockchain transactions. In 2024, these rewards will drop from the current 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC. The halving is one of the most important events in the Bitcoin ecosystem as it directly impacts the supply and demand dynamics of the BTC market. Rekt Capital believes that the cryptocurrency behaves in a certain way as the Halving approaches. In 2019, after years of trending to the downside and moving sideways, Bitcoin experienced a relief rally. The analyst believes the upside momentum experienced in the past weeks coincides with this relief rally. The chart below shows that the 2019 and the current price action are similar. The chart shows the cryptocurrency crashed from the short-term top formed after the relief rally. If history repeats, the Bitcoin price will drop to the lows of the triangle, targeting a critical resistance of around $30,000. Following The Roadmap In the financial world, traders often look at past price data to predict future results, but history rarely repeats similarly. However, Rekt Capital believes a crash from the current levels or the area closest to $30,000 could be an opportunity and a roadmap. Market participants should be on the look of this crash and of a spike in trading volume as BTC reaches a critical point. Two months before the halving, this spike in volume should hint at an imminent rally. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Data To Prove That XRP Is Deflationary In the short term, traders should keep an eye on the low pointed out by the analyst; if Bitcoin touches these levels, there is an opportunity to set up a position before BTC reclaims the area above $30,000. As the chart above shows, the cryptocurrency often breaks critical resistance very close to the Halving. Rekt Capital wrote: ~60 days before the Halving, a Pre-Halving rally tends to occur (light blue). In anticipation of the Halving, investors “Buy the Hype” in an effort to “Sell the News.” Once Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation area breakout into the parabolic uptrend (green). It is during this phase Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth on its way to new All Time Highs.

42392373,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5oVl,1696861489,"Crypto Needs Congress, But U.S. Lawmakers Have Opted for Pandemonium","An already tenuous plan for crypto legislation in the House of Representatives could be thrown into uncertainty by its leadership mess.  Industry lobbyists think there could still be a window for House progress by the end of the year, though the Senate still poses a problem.  Without the U.S. Congress outlining a clear system of rules, the crypto industry fears it’ll be relegated as a volatile financial backwater. But Capitol Hill is beset by drama, including a U.S. House of Representatives that fired its speaker and a budget debate that could derail the federal government.  Two crypto bills are carrying a lot of the sector’s hopes, because they’ve made it further than any legislation to date: one House bill that would establish rules for digital assets markets and another that would set up regulations for issuing and trading stablecoins in the U.S. Until now, Crypto lobbyists thought that both pieces of legislation had a shot to reach the House floor in November.  The problems: Nov. 17 is the new deadline for a government shutdown, unless Congress can agree to a spending plan it wasn’t able to execute last month. And one of the top voices in that negotiation is the speaker of the House. Republicans dumped the speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), in an unprecedented fashion and are yet to pick a new one.  “Given that there's such a distraction with everything else going on, it probably means no consideration of crypto bills in the short run,” said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Washington-based Blockchain Association.  It’s possible for lawmakers to work on crypto efforts while also dealing with the bigger budget drama. (Members of the powerful House Financial Services Committee proved that by clearing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) bill while the spending debate raged before last month’s 45-day agreement to postpone the budget deadline.)  But the chairman of the Financial Services Committee that has shepherded a number of crypto-related bills toward the House floor, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), is now the acting speaker. It’s positive for the crypto industry that he really wants to get digital assets legislation approved, and his new role turns up his volume. What’s bad: He’s pretty busy.  New Speaker  When the Republicans pick a permanent leader, McHenry may have some goodwill to spend. So far, Reps. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the House leadership’s current No. 2, and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) – who is backed by former President Donald Trump – are openly vying for the job. Neither of them have records of supporting crypto.  Possibly more important for crypto, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) is hoping to step up from House majority whip to Scalise’s majority leader position, which would put a fervid crypto advocate in an even higher role. But he may face opposition, because the same Trump-devoted corner of the Republican Party that ousted McCarthy now seeks to take over the leadership.  The election is meant to be a short-term affair, possibly ending when the Republicans gather to settle things this week. Still, winning the necessary votes may not be so easy in a party torn by infighting, and it's uncertain what kind of side deals will be struck by the eventual winner. McHenry would presumably return to his committee having scored a few points against Democrats during his short time with the gavel.  Almost instantly, the permanent new speaker will have to try to resolve the budget dispute that still threatens to hang a closed sign on the government next month. If lawmakers are battling over the budget, they may not have bandwidth for much else – including crypto.  Smith speculated that McHenry would be well placed to enact crypto legislation when he returns to his committee position.  “He's been called upon and stepped up at a time when his House colleagues needed him to help cut a deal and that is going to create a tremendous amount of goodwill and political capital that McHenry will be able to use in other areas down the road,"" she said.  Crypto legislation  The House will have “only about five weeks” to avert a shutdown, warns an analysis from Beacon Policy Advisors in Washington. Last time, members passed a so-called continuing resolution (CR) to provide temporary funding.  “Fiscal conservatives will be loath to back another CR, but completing work on all 12 appropriations bills and negotiating them with the Senate before then is a tall order,” Beacon wrote in a note to clients, predicting that a choice of Jordan would be more likely to end in a shutdown (Jordan his been referred to as a “legislative terrorist.”) “The new speaker will likely view McCarthy’s compromise with Democrats in hindsight as a cautionary tale.”  Crypto legislation was on track for House consideration next month, but it’s now less certain when it will come up, observers say.  “The U.S. needs regulatory clarity that protects consumers and promotes innovation, so the hope is that we see movement before the end of the year,” said Ji Kim, the general counsel and head of global policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, an international advocacy group.  The fate of the digital assets bills considered now in the House is unclear. They could fail to go anywhere at all for the rest of the year, which tends to be the safest prediction for any bills in this Congress. They could achieve floor votes – maybe even victories – but they’d likely meet a quiet death in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Or some portions of the bills could be pushed into must-pass budgetary legislation and ride those coattails into law. But that would likely need support from both parties in both chambers, for which the stablecoin bill may be the more likely.  Whatever happens, the industry isn’t entirely in love with the current language of those bills, so lobbyists are hoping to edit the legislation while it’s in motion.  Senate resistance  The Senate is showing none of the enthusiasm for crypto action that House Republicans – and a handful of Democrats – have demonstrated.  Neither Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, nor Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the panel’s top Republican and a current candidate for the party’s presidential nomination, are openly engaged with crypto legislation. Brown’s most recent comments, on the contrary, encouraged regulators to delve into their existing authorities to deal with dangers from the industry. Meanwhile, Brown has put his focus on the Secure And Fair Enforcement Regulation (SAFER) Banking Act meant to ensure proper financial services for the marijuana industry.  “It just depends on what it is that Sherrod Brown wants and is there some kind of negotiation that can come together,” Smith said. “If Brown wants to get his SAFER Banking bill done – or something like that – maybe he'll say, ‘Fine, I'll give you guys stablecoins if you take my cannabis banking bill.”  Because this is only the first year of the two-year congressional session, the end of the calendar isn’t a death sentence for any of the legislation. However, January starts a presidential election year when the political stakes increase on everything and the partisan fight gets bloodier, so moving legislation becomes more complicated.

42392359,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5nBh,1696861220,Crypto Risks Another Sam Bankman-Fried if U.S. Doesn't Provide Clear Regulation,"It feels like all eyes are trained on two courthouses in New York this week, as two men with (formerly) distinctive hair launch defenses against their alleged bad behavior. But just as the Elizabeth Holmes trial was not about Theranos' diagnostic testing, the SBF trial is not about crypto. It’s a tale as old as fraud.  The actions of a single person should not, and do not, serve as a barometer for the crypto industry. Sam Bankman-Fried is having a spectacular and ongoing implosion, and as this trial continues, we expect to see further evidence that Sam was out there primarily for himself.  Sheila Warren is CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation.  In an ideal world, the focal point of the trial would be the harm to customers caused by the actions of a few. The cult of celebrity around SBF and the need for ""a bad guy"" storyline are parts of the problem.  Victims deserve more than headlines; they deserve restitution. And true remorse? That's not just a legal term; it's a moral imperative that must be visibly demonstrated.  It’s important to note that while other countries are watching this trial with the seemingly requisite ghoulish interest, they’re not seeing it as a referendum on an entire cryptocurrency industry or asset class. If we take a step back and look at what's happened outside the U.S. since the SBF news broke, other countries have doubled down on this tech. Governments around the world are actively building legislative and regulatory frameworks; offering important legal certainty to ecosystem operators and crucially, enhanced protection for consumers.  See also: The DOJ Has Come Out Swinging in the Sam Bankman-Fried Trial  Earlier this year the EU put in place comprehensive legislation and is already iterating on it. The Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) is the first big piece of legislation from a leading economy to legislate digital assets and introduce a harmonized regulatory framework.  It lays out rules for the EU’s 27 member countries covering issuers of stablecoins (categorized as asset reference tokens or electronic money tokens), unbacked crypto assets, trading venues and exchanges (known as crypto asset service providers or CASPs). Decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and staking were all, sensibly, carved out of this piece of legislation, though the European Commission has a mandate to study and report back to legislators on these aspects before too long.  The goal of regulation should be to disincentive bad behavior ... and create a path to accountability.  MICA was adopted in May 2023, with rules on stablecoins applying from the middle of next year and rules on CASPs from the end of 2024. In the meantime, more detailed technical rules, fleshing out the law, are being worked on by the European Supervisory Authorities and will be finalized before MiCA applies.  In the last year, the United Kingdom has made moves to develop its framework for digital assets. While the journey has not been totally smooth sailing, and organizations have experienced registration delays, the country is moving forward.  This progress can be seen in a consultation by His Majesty's Treasury, titled ""the future financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets,"" which concluded on April 30, 2023. The Treasury is expected to publish its response to the consultation in the coming weeks. A pivotal moment in this development came when the Financial Services and Markets Bill received approval at the end of June, enabling legislative changes that give regulators more oversight of cryptoassets.  Further, the Bill expands the scope of the Banking Act, and includes payment systems using digital settlement assets. This will include some stablecoin activities and could pave the way for a new regulatory regime. The bill also allows the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to oversee crypto asset promotions, with new rules applying from Sunday.  The government's ongoing goal is to establish the U.K. as a leading global center for crypto assets. This objective originated from statements made by the former Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glenn in April 2022, and has been reiterated by the current EST Andrew Griffith. These aspirations have a significant impact on the speed and direction of policy-making.  Japan, which heeded lessons learned from a previous crisis and put consumer protections in place, has incorporated Web3 into its national economic plan. Additionally, in June this year, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) amended the Payment Services Act (PSA). The agencies wanted to update the country’s regulatory framework for stablecoins and crypto assets. This amendment revised the definition of crypto assets, included new guidelines for crypto asset exchanges, banking and travel rules, as well as a new framework for stablecoin issuers.  Crypto moves in the U.S.  Leaving aside SBF, a general lack of regulatory infrastructure and a default to deregulation have done little to deter antisocial behavior in the crypto industry. Humans are going to human, and the goal of regulation should be to disincentive bad behavior, make it very hard to get away with, and create a path to accountability and consequences when some try it anyway.  In the U.S., we appreciate the serious attention that some government officials are giving to crypto and blockchain technology.  We saw, among other developments, the formation of a new Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion, a record number of bills voted on in the House and continued bipartisan interest.  Specifically, we saw the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) being passed out of both the House Financial Services and House Agricultural Committees. FIT21 would establish a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S., while allocating needed oversight between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, which provides for a regulatory framework for the issuance and oversight of payment stablecoins, also passed out of the House Financial Services Committee.  While progress is needed, many leaders recognize this technology cannot be put back in the box and will continue to evolve without the U.S.’s endorsement. Recent progress in the Congress reflects recognition of this fact and the urgency to provide regulatory clarity for a burgeoning and transformative industry.

18558910,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554593,1696860048,"Bitcoin Makes Another Attempt At $28,000, Can Break Happen?","Bitcoin is currently trying to have another go at the $28,000 level. Here’s what on-chain data says regarding whether a retest can be successful. Bitcoin On-Chain Signals Are Not All Positive Right Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked into a couple of on-chain indicators that may provide some hints about whether BTC can sustain any bullish momentum currently or not. The first metric of relevance is the “supply on exchanges,” which keeps track of the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric decreases, it means that withdrawals are taking place on these platforms right now. Generally, investors take out their coins to self-custodial wallets whenever they intend to hold onto them for extended periods, so this kind of trend can have a bullish effect in the long term. Related Reading: These Bitcoin Holders Have Bought Almost $2 Billion In Last 6 Weeks: Data On the other hand, the reverse trend implies selling may be going in the market as holders are depositing a net amount of the cryptocurrency to the exchanges at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply on exchanges over the past few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been going down in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on X From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin supply on exchanges has observed a constant decline during the past month. This naturally suggests that the investors are transferring a net number of coins out of these platforms. As mentioned before, if the investors are accumulating with these withdrawals, the price could feel a bullish impact, although it may only appear in the long term. Therefore, these outflows may not directly be relevant to the current price surge. Another way to look at the net withdrawals, however, is that at the very least net deposits aren’t taking place currently. As is visible from the chart, the recovery rally at the end of August very quickly died out as investors transferred a large amount of BTC toward exchanges. For now, it would appear that such a selloff isn’t taking place, which could potentially allow for the asset’s run to continue. There is another indicator highlighted in the graph, but unlike the supply on exchanges, this one doesn’t seem to be showing a positive trend. This metric is the “daily active addresses,” which keeps track of the unique number of addresses that are participating in transaction activity on the blockchain. This indicator has now plunged toward the lowest levels since late August, implying that user interest in the asset is low currently. Related Reading: This Ethereum Metric Is Retesting The Bear-Bull Junction, Will Break Happen? Historically, rallies have only been sustainable when they have been able to amass a large amount of trader attention, as such moves typically require a high amount of fuel. At present, the current recovery move lacks such investor activity. On top of this, the $27,900 level is currently a point of major resistance, as that’s where the average cost basis of the short-term holders lies, as CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn has pointed out. BTC is currently retesting this level | Source: @JA_Maartun on X All in all, it looks like a significant break above the $28,000 level could prove to be quite tricky for the cryptocurrency in the near future unless things can turn around fast in terms of user interest.

Crypto Exchange Reveals Hackers Tried To Gain Access 159,000 Times","Reports from South Korea-based Yonhap News Agency have revealed that Upbit, one of the largest crypto exchanges in South Korea experienced over 159,000 hacking attempts in the first half of 2023 alone. Upbit’s Hacking Attempts According to the data from Upbit’s parent company Dunamu shared with the local news agency, the hacking attempts of the first half of 2023 indicate a 117% increase compared to the first half of 2022, and a 1,800% increase in hacking attempts compared to the second half of 2020. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Data To Prove That XRP Is Deflationary The crypto exchange recorded 8,356 hack attempts in the second half of 2020, 34,687 in the first half of 2021, 63,912 in the second half of 2021, 73,249 in the first half of 2022, and 73,249 in the second half of 2022. These hack attempts have increased over the years after the crypto exchange suffered a hack of 58 billion won ($50 million) in 2019. The exchange has since successfully fortified its security measures to prevent these hacks, and the exchange has not experienced any exploit since 2019. “After the hacking incident in 2019, we took various measures to prevent a recurrence, such as distributing hot wallets and operating them, and to date, not a single cyber breach has occurred,” a Dunamu Official stated. Some of these measures included an increased percentage of money retained in cold wallets by 70%. Hot wallets, which keep keys online and are more susceptible to breaches, are thought to be less secure than cold wallets, which store private keys offline. This is because the majority of known cryptocurrency exchange hacking instances have occurred in hot wallets, especially the crypto hacks that occurred in September. One such example is Hong Kong-based CoinEx which suffered a $70 million hack in September 2023, and Mixin Network which suffered a $200 million hack, among others. Total market cap sitting at $1.05 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Due to the significant increase in cryptocurrency hack attempts in South Korea, the country’s Representative Park Seong-jung has called upon the South Korean government to take considerable measures to handle the issue. “The Ministry of Science and Technology must conduct large-scale whitewashing mock tests and investigate information security conditions in preparation for cyber attacks against virtual asset exchanges where hacking attempts are frequent,” Representative Park said. Upbit recently experienced an issue in late September 2023, where the crypto exchange was unable to identify a fake token, “ClaimAPTGift.com, present in 400,000 Aptos wallets. This led to the suspension of Aptos token services. Compilation Of Crypto Funds Stolen In September September 2023, was a nightmare for certain crypto exchanges as about $332 million in crypto assets were stolen from certain crypto exchanges in September alone. Related Reading: Dogecoin In A Dire Position As Daily Active Addresses Drop Drastically Blockchain security firm Certik took to their official X handle in late September to share the compilation of the crypto hacks that occurred in the month alone and how much was stolen from these incidents.

However, exploits accounted for the most, with over 98% ($329.8 million) of the total amount stolen in that month, while exit scams and flash attacks accounted for the rest.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Digital asset investment funds witnessed inflows for the second week totalling $78 million, the largest inflows since July, according to data from CoinShares. Bitcoin investment funds saw the largest proportion of inflows, totalling $43 million. Bitcoin trading volumes also rose by 16% last week, said the report. CoinShares noted that some investors poured some $1.2 million into short-bitcoin positions after recent price strength. Bitcoin ended September trading at lows of around $26,200 and rose to around $28,400 by the start of October. The Ethereum futures ETF launch in the U.S., attracted under $10 million in its first week, highlighting a muted investor appetite, said the report.  Deribit, the world's leading crypto options exchange by trading volume and open interest, will soon offer options tied to prominent alternative cryptocurrencies XRP, SOL and MATIC. The exchange announced its expansion plan on X soon before press time, adding that it is seeking a brokerage license in the European Union (EU). Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call gives the right to buy while a put offers the right to sell.  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried should be barred from bringing up artificial intelligence company Anthropic's recent fundraising efforts in his defense against U.S. Department of Justice charges, prosecutors said on Sunday. The DOJ has been discussing issues that may be raised during witness testimony in Bankman-Fried's trial, and the parties ""have reached agreement on many of these issues,"" said a filing. One area they remain apart on is whether the defense team can raise any issues around the Anthropic fundraise. The DOJ alleges that the $500 million investment in Anthropic in 2022 came from customer funds. ""Evidence regarding the current value of the defendant’s investments could only be used to support the argument that FTX customers and/or other victims will ultimately be made whole, which the Court has recognized is an impermissible purpose,"" the filing said.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows the annualized premium in three-month bitcoin futures trading on Binance.  The premium, representing the return from cash and carry trades, has topped 5%, surpassing the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and matching the two-year Treasury yield.  Carry trades lost their shine last year as yields surged while the bear market saw futures trading at a negligible premium.

18555627,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554597,1696852854,XRP Options To Debut On Deribit: A Game-Changer For Price,"The rapidly evolving crypto market is set to witness yet another milestone as Deribit, the world’s preeminent crypto options exchange, prepares to launch options contracts for XRP, Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC). Given the dominating position of Deribit in the options sphere, this inclusion could have noteworthy ramifications on the pricing dynamics of XRP. Deribit To Debut XRP Options Deribit, having established itself as the leading crypto options exchange both in terms of trading volume and open interest, is not letting the recent dip in digital-asset volatility deter its expansion endeavors. As reported by Bloomberg, the exchange is poised to roll out options contracts for the XRP token in January. This move, announced by Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers, will augment the platform’s offering which until now has been focused mainly on Bitcoin, Ether, and USD Coin options. The choice might be influenced by financial interests and prevailing market conditions. Trading volumes for crypto derivatives declined to roughly $1.5 trillion in September, down from about $2 trillion earlier in the year, affected by reduced prices and volatility relative to the highs of 2021. Related Reading: When Are AMMs Coming To XRP Ledger? Ripple CTO Gives Clear Answer Further solidifying its strategic vision, Deribit is not just limiting itself to options expansion. The Panama-based giant has disclosed plans to transition its operations to Dubai, a more crypto-receptive jurisdiction, following the attainment of necessary licensing. Parallel to this, the firm intends to bolster its workforce by approximately a dozen, adding to its current roster of 115. Strijers expressed the inherent challenges in timing new product launches given the current market sentiment. “Is this the best environment to launch new products or should we defer?” he reflected, but remained optimistic about potential volatility upticks post the January launch. Impact On The Price With an overwhelming 85% market share in options trading, the influence of Deribit is unmistakable. The rest of the market is shared by competitors like OKX, Binance, and Bybit. A considerable 85% of the volume flowing through Deribit originates from institutional clientele. Therefore, the addition of XRP options on such a dominant platform is inevitably going to steer substantial attention toward XRP’s pricing dynamics. Options, by design, provide traders the privilege (without an obligation) to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price until a specific date. This can have multifaceted implications for the underlying asset. XRP, as it gets intertwined with the options mechanism, might witness higher short-term volatility in its pricing, particularly around the expiry of these contracts. Related Reading: XRP Price On The Cusp Of Major Uptick To $1.4: Crypto Analyst “Quarterly expiries are typically the most significant, in terms of volume and value,” highlighted Strijers in a recent discourse. Drawing parallels with Bitcoin, it’s plausible that XRP might undergo amplified volatility as these options contracts approach their expiration, especially at quarter-end, depending on the volume of XRP options being traded. Conclusively, with Deribit’s unassailable stature in the options space and the inherent nature of options contracts, the induction of XRP options might very well become a pivotal point in XRP’s pricing journey. Traders, especially those engaged in XRP, will need to brace themselves for the nuanced challenges and opportunities this integration brings forth. At press time, XRP was trading at $0.4994 after briefly falling to $0.4880.

Dunamu submitted its findings to Rep.

That’s about 879 on average each day. Hackers may have employed a variety of common methods for the attacks, such as email phishing or DDoS, although Dunamu did not mention specifics in the filing.  DDoS, short for Distributed Denial-of-Service, is a cybercrime in which the attacker floods a server with internet traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites.  Dunamu said the findings were 2.17 times the of “infringement attempts” in the first half of last year, which saw just over 73,200 cases.  Although not widely known outside of its home market, UPbit trades billions of dollars on tokens and Korean won trading pairs and is notorious for attracting exuberant rallies on listed tokens.  Earlier this year, the exchange processed some $2.5 billion in XRP trading volumes over a 24-hour period, as a U.S. court ruled the sale of XRP on exchanges did not constitute investment contracts.

This protracted period of stagnation has left traders and enthusiasts alike scratching their heads, wondering when the next significant move might occur. The current SHIB price, as reported by CoinGecko, hovers at $0.00000715, representing a modest 1.4% decline over the last 24 hours. Over the span of seven days, the meme coin has dipped by nearly 6%, indicating a gradual erosion of value. This pattern of price fluctuations within such a confined range underscores a lack of decisive action from both buyers and sellers, painting a picture of market ambivalence. Related Reading: XRP Journey To $0.55: Is A Breakthrough Imminent In The Coming Days? Implications Of A Range-Bound Market For Shiba Inu One can’t help but wonder about the implications of this seemingly stuck range. Given the broader crypto market’s recent slump, it wouldn’t be surprising to see SHIB test the lower echelon of this range, potentially signaling an extension of its bearish undertones. With the larger market sentiment in a state of flux, SHIB’s fate remains intertwined with the broader crypto landscape. SHIB market cap hitting $4.17 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com The ongoing downtrend in SHIB’s price can be visually traced to the formation of a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart. This pattern is characterized by two converging trendlines that serve as dynamic resistances and supports. While such patterns can sometimes hint at an impending bullish breakout, the prevailing market sentiment suggests that investors should remain cautious and prepared for any outcome. Declining Whale Activity: What Does It Mean? Another noteworthy development in the SHIB ecosystem is the decline in large network transactions. The number of significant transactions on the SHIB network has dwindled to a mere 20, marking one of the most inactive periods for the meme coin, especially concerning the activity of its large holders. Several factors could be contributing to this sudden drop in whale activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Ready For Blast-Off As Key Metrics Signal A Bull Run: Top Analyst One of the potential reasons might be the waning interest in highly volatile assets like SHIB, particularly as Bitcoin’s dominance continues to rise within the crypto sphere. As the flagship cryptocurrency asserts its dominance, many investors appear to be realigning their portfolios, moving away from riskier assets to more established ones. This shift in investor sentiment could explain the reduction in significant SHIB transactions as market participants seek more stability in their cryptocurrency holdings. The formation of a falling wedge pattern and the decline in large network transactions underscore the challenges facing SHIB’s price trajectory. SHIB holders and enthusiasts must remain vigilant and adaptable to navigate the ever-changing tides of the digital asset market. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

18552534,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554595,1696845637,Crypto Analyst Presents Data To Prove That XRP Is Deflationary,"In the past, many have argued whether or not the XRP token was deflationary or not. In support of the former, pro-XRP crypto analyst Panos Mekras has provided data that suggests that the token has deflationary characteristics. Number Of Tokens Burned So Far In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Mekras referenced another tweet showing that over 11 million tokens had been burned. This stat undoubtedly suggests that the token is deflationary since its total supply has decreased over time due to the burn mechanism. Related Reading: 39-Month Cycle Says XRP Price Is Poised For Breakout To $1,000, Here’s When However, another X user (@hasen_van) argued that the token was only deflationary in “respect to all XRP in existence” and that the token will continue to be inflationary as long “as Ripple keeps on selling into the open market.” true with respect to all XRP in existence, but from a holders point of view – given that mostly all exchanges are using circulating supply (x price) to measure market cap, XRP is inflationary as long as ripple keeps on selling into the open market. #fridayfacts — VanHasen (@hasen_van) October 6, 2023 In response, Mekras tried to correct the belief that some XRP tokens were not yet “in existence” as he stated that XRP’s total supply of 100 billion has existed since “day 1,” meaning that 100% of its supply has been circulating from the beginning and some XRP tokens cannot be classified as ‘non-existent’ yet. This debate seems to stem from the fact that Ripple has an escrow system in place. As such, some (like VanHansen) believe that the XRP in escrow lockups does not fall under its circulating supply and that this escrow system affects XRP’s deflationary status. However, people like Mekras argue that the escrow system doesn’t change the fact that the token is deflationary. VanHansen further argued that the token cannot be deflationary (except technically) as XRP’s circulating supply gets inflated every time “Ripple releases XRP from the escrow.” Both sides seemed to look at it from different angles, with Mekras abiding by what deflationary meant in the strict sense while VanHansen was trying to provide a context. Bulls continue to fight to hold support | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Is XRP Deflationary Or Not? It is worth mentioning that the XRP Ledger doesn’t exactly have a built-in mechanism to decrease the token’s total supply, unlike some other networks. For instance, Ethereum implemented the London hard fork, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism with some Ether burned immediately after processing a transaction. Related Reading: When Are AMMs Coming To XRP Ledger? Ripple CTO Gives Clear Answer However, in XRP’s case, these token burns have occurred coincidentally rather than being a deflationary model on the network. In July, an engineer at Ripple explained that the monumental increase in the burn rate was mostly because of the XRPL account deletions. He mentioned that 2 XRP are usually burned when an account is deleted. He further noted that 85,556 old accounts on the Ledger were deleted in June, which led to over 100,000 XRP being burned. Hence, the burned token figure rises every time an account is deleted.

42392357,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5nLx,1696845600,The DOJ Has Come Out Swinging in the Sam Bankman-Fried Trial,"Hey, Gary Wang: What are we, chopped liver?  The FTX co-founder and former chief technology officer continued testifying in Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial Friday, sharing how the Alameda hedge fund was able to access an enormous credit line at the exchange with his former colleague’s blessing.  Prosecutors walked him through the events of the last few years (Alameda owed FTX over $100 million as far back as 2019!) but spent extra time on November 2022, putting a calendar up so the jury (and those of us watching from the back) could keep track of what happened when. FTX and Alameda were troubled for years, with Alameda borrowing billions from FTX over the course of the exchange’s lifetime and requiring an ever-increasing credit line from its sibling company, Wang said. The situation really escalated, however, after “some crypto news site” published a leaked balance sheet, he said.  “There was some balance sheet of Alameda that got leaked to some websites, and it was published on some crypto news site,” Wang said. (Ed. note: As far as I know, the sheet wasn’t leaked to “some websites” – CoinDesk reporter Ian Allison sourced it through the course of being a professional journalist, helping us win three awards.)  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  The trial has started off strong for the Department of Justice. Some expected the DOJ to bring its most important witnesses – namely Sam Bankman-Fried’s former inner circle – toward the end of the trial – but oh how wrong we were. After a brief testimony from a French trader who fell victim to FTX, we heard from a former software developer and close friend of Bankman-Fried – Adam Yedidia – on Wednesday and the majority of Thursday.  In one sense, Yedidia was a prosecutor’s dream witness. The former math and engineering major from MIT seemed genuine and at times slightly worried that he might say the wrong thing. His answers were clearly well-rehearsed, if not always accessible to the layperson. At one point, Judge Kaplan had to ask follow-up questions to his answer just to make sure he understood what Yedidia said, and it wasn’t because the subject itself was complicated.  “I was trying to quantify my uncertainty about how many users FTX had during 2022,” Yedidia said.  After each question asked by the defense, Yedidia paused, as he anticipated an objection from the prosecution. When there wasn’t one, he answered.  On Friday, Judge Kaplan overruled (which means rejected) 65% of the objections by the defense, which was a much smaller proportion than the day before, when Bankman-Fried’s lawyer’s really got on his nerves. In comparison, he rejected none of the prosecution’s objections Friday.  Yedidia was followed by one of the strongest witnesses in this case so far: Gary Wang, who started off by saying that he committed financial crimes at FTX and that he committed them with the defendant, Sam Bankman-Fried.  Wang’s testimony walked the jury through what turned out to be a veeeeeeery long explanation of how deposits, codes, algorithms, accounting (and more boring stuff) worked at FTX. Yes, we saw some occasional yawns, but nobody in the courtroom fell asleep, so that’s an improvement from Thursday!  Wang testified that Alameda had “special privileges” at FTX that allowed the crypto hedge fund to spend $8 billion of exchange customers’ money, among other things. While he wrote the code allowing that spending, he did so at the direction of Bankman-Fried, he said. It is safe to say just about everybody witnessing this week’s trial so far has the same conclusion: It doesn’t look good for the former FTX CEO.  Defense woes continue  The defense team began cross-examining Wang, but as it did yesterday, it quickly ran afoul of the judge.  At one point, defense counsel Christian Everdell asked Wang to read (to himself, not aloud) a sentence from a document to refresh his memory about something he supposedly said to the DOJ. This document wasn’t shown to the jury. After reading it, Wang said he could not recall what he specifically said to the DOJ, leading Everdell to describe the contents of the – again, unshown – memo and say “Is it true that that's what's said there?”  The prosecution objected and Judge Lewis Kaplan admonished the defense for a second time in as many days: “Don’t do that again.”  As he did on Thursday, the judge also urged the defense to stop going over information previously asked and answered, ultimately ending court proceedings a few minutes early. He was seen driving off in his vehicle once again barely 30 minutes later.  What we're expecting  Gary Wang will wrap up testimony as the defense tries to complete a cross-examination without having every question objected to. But most of Wang’s testimony Friday centered around technical details. Prosecutors literally brought up lines of code to ask questions about how the FTX platform and website worked. Boring! I mean not really, it’s actually quite fascinating stuff, but you get what I mean.  Potentially as soon as later Tuesday, though, we’re going to hear from Caroline Ellison, the one-time Jane Street trader turned Alameda Research CEO. There's two reasons why people want to hear from her: For one thing, she ran Alameda, the company that took FTX customer funds and somehow lost billions of dollars. For another, she is Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend, the one he threw under the bus in the New York Times, and there is a fair bit of intrigue about what she’ll say from that perspective.  But let’s focus: Alameda and its borrowing of FTX customer funds is the real issue at the heart of this trial, and Ellison’s testimony can clarify to what extent Bankman-Fried may have been aware of and/or directed the financial malfeasance prosecutors allege took place.  There's no court today owing to the federal holiday, as a reminder.

42409594,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLYH5,1696844952,Bitcoin Is Better Than Digital Gold: Matrixport,"The connection between gold and bitcoin (BTC) as stores of value is obvious, and the demand for BTC as a digital store of value was a big reason why the cryptocurrency grew in popularity, crypto services provider Matrixport said in a report Monday.  Bitcoin’s market capitalization is $540 billion, equivalent to 10.8% of the market cap of physical financial gold, Matrixport said, adding that gold exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) are valued at $200 billion.  This is why potential approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF could result in inflows of $20 - $30 billion, potentially triggering a large rally in the cryptocurrency, the report said.  The SEC has dragged its heels on approving a spot bitcoin ETF, and in August said it was delaying its decision on all new applications until October. The crypto market is hopeful that such an approval will trigger a flood of mainstream money into the sector.  Still, bitcoin has an edge over gold as the private keys can be memorized, which eliminates the risk of confiscation, the report said.  “Even today, storing assets in the form of gold has not only become unfashionable in the digital age, but comes with significant restrictions when crossing borders,” wrote Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, adding that “bitcoin offers a solution to this dilemma, enabling the swift and relatively inconspicuous movement of value across borders.”  “Therefore, considering the current state of technological developments, bitcoin’s primary roles are likely as a store of value akin to gold and a speculative financial asset,” the report added.

TechDev, a prominent crypto analyst known for insightful market analysis, recently shared a compelling perspective on social media platform X. Drawing parallels to historical trends, TechDev contends that Bitcoin is currently in a familiar position, reminiscent of the preludes to the 2016 and 2020 bull markets. Related Reading: XRP Journey To $0.55: Is A Breakthrough Imminent In The Coming Days? Bitcoin Price Analysis: Volatility Contraction Signals Imminent Breakout To illustrate this perspective, TechDev presented a chart featuring monthly candles, Bollinger bands, and a specialized indicator showcasing the logarithmic width between the bands in relation to the 200-month moving average. What is particularly intriguing about this chart is how Bitcoin’s Bollinger bands, which gauge relative volatility, have significantly contracted, implying a forthcoming breakout to the upside. What #bitcoin has looked like before heading north… pic.twitter.com/aDCCAKSDli — TechDev (@TechDev_52) October 6, 2023 This influential analyst further points out that Bitcoin is not alone in its quest for a bullish breakout; the broader altcoin market is also in contention. To make this comparison, TechDev references the “OTHERS” chart, measuring the collective market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). In TechDev’s analysis, Bitcoin has forged crucial support levels at the inception of a long-term bullish momentum. Simultaneously, the “OTHERS” index has managed to break through a long-standing downward resistance. These developments collectively indicate that both Bitcoin and the altcoin market are primed for significant moves, potentially marking the end of the bear market phase. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin’s price stands at $27,916 with a 24-hour price movement of 0.0% and a marginal 0.1% decline over the past week. This relative stability suggests that investors are holding their positions, awaiting the anticipated breakout. BTCUSD selling at $27,826 today.

18549269,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554576,1696838406,Binance CEO Foresees Monumental Bitcoin Price Shift Following Halving,"As the crypto community’s anticipation heightens for the upcoming Bitcoin halving, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), CEO of Binance, recently elucidated his observations around the historical patterns tied to this quadrennial event. Highlighting the evolving sentiments and speculations, CZ spotlighted the dominant themes before and after the halving events. CZ observed that the preceding months to the halving are generally characterized by heightened discourse, diverse sentiments, and amplified expectations within the cryptocurrency sphere. “The few months leading up to the Bitcoin halving, there will be more and more chatter, news, anxiety, expectations, hype, hope, etc.,” he stated. Addressing the commonly held belief that Bitcoin’s price will witness an immediate uptick post-halving, CZ dispelled such notions based on historical patterns. “The day after the halving, the Bitcoin price won’t double overnight. And people will be asking why it didn’t,” he remarked, addressing the immediate aftermath expectations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At Risk? Whale Transfers $137 Million In BTC After 3-Year Dormancy While the short-term reactions post-halving may be tempered, CZ shed light on a longer-term trend where Bitcoin often reaches new all-time highs (ATHs) within the year that follows. In reference to the market’s ability to quickly transition from skepticism to marvel, he quipped, “People have short memories.” However, CZ urged caution, emphasizing that historical patterns should not be construed as definitive indicators for future behaviors, noting, “Not saying there is proven causation. And history does NOT predict the future.” A More In-Depth Analysis Of Bitcoin Halving As Bitcoinist reported, renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently published an in-depth analysis of the Bitcoin halving, offering a more granular view of the potential phases surrounding the event which is only 197 days and a few hours away according to Binance’s estimates. Related Reading: Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit $750,000, Here’s When Reflecting on historical patterns, the analyst suggested a possible deeper retrace for Bitcoin in the 140 days leading up to the halving. Drawing historical parallels, Rekt Capital emphasized, “You can debate whether 2023 is more like 2015 or more like 2019… Doesn’t change the fact that BTC retraced -24% in 2015 and -38% in 2019 at this same point in the cycle (i.e. ~200 days before the halving).” Anticipating market dynamics as the halving nears, Rekt Capital postulated that roughly 60 days before the event, historically a pre-halving rally will likely emerge. This phase, marked by investor enthusiasm and elevated expectations as CZ puts it, is often characterized by buying into the halving anticipation. But this enthusiastic phase doesn’t last. Around the halving event, the market often shows pullback behavior under the motto “buy the rumor, sell the news”.

Bitcoin [BTC] dropped 1.7% over the past 24 hours to $27,500, outperforming most digital assets as crypto investment services firm Matrixport touted the largest crypto asset as ""better than digital gold."" Bitcoin late Friday and over the weekend seemed primed to challenge a two-month high above $28,400, but was unable to move above $28,200 before sellers finally took over early this morning.  The broad CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was lower by 2%.  Ether [ETH] suffered a 2.5% decline as – in addition to macro jitters – the Ethereum Foundation sold $2.7M of tokens on UniSwap. The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization extended its losing streak against BTC, dropping to a fresh 15-month low relative to bitcoin.  Losses were larger among other altcoins. Ripple Labs-adjacent token [XRP], solana [SOL], Polygon's native token [MATIC], Avalanche's [AVAX] and popular meme token dogecoin [DOGE] are all lower by 4%-5% over the past 24 hours.  Hamas attack on Israel shakes markets  The Israel-Hamas conflict extended to its third day on Monday. Fears of the conflict spilling over to neighboring states, such as Iran, seemed to impact oil prices as traders opined it could disrupt supply.  “There could be “a pretty dramatic effect on the oil market” should the U.S. enforce sanctions on Iranian exports, Josh Young, chief investment officer of energy investment firm Bison Interests told CNBC. “I think it’s appropriate to see oil, let’s say, [up] about $5 for WTI.”  WTI crude oil rose near 3.5% since Sunday to $86.54 per barrel, MarketWatch data shows, extending three-month gains to 16%.

Amidst the turbulent waters of the crypto market, XRP seems to be carving out a path towards a significant upswing. Early last week, it faced yet another pullback from the stubborn resistance level at $0.55, a steadfast battlement that has thwarted crypto buyers repeatedly in the past two months. The $0.55 resistance level has proven to be a tough barrier for XRP enthusiasts, with four unsuccessful attempts to breach this significant threshold. Each time, rejection candles have punctuated the charts, underscoring the determination of sellers to maintain their defensive stance. However, amidst this persistent standoff, there is a glimmer of hope in the form of a steadily ascending support trendline, acting as a protective barrier against deeper price plunges. This intriguing interplay between resistance and support is indicative of the formation of an ascending triangle pattern, a potential sign of bullish continuation. Related Reading: Trillions In Shiba Inu On The Move: What Lies Ahead For The Meme Coin? XRP’s Rejection Candles: The Formation of an Ascending Triangle An ascending triangle is a technical chart pattern characterized by a rising support trendline and a horizontal resistance level. It suggests that as the price nears the apex of the triangle, buyers could regain their enthusiasm, potentially propelling the coin upwards and maintaining its lateral movement. Currently, XRP is trading at approximately $0.517198 on CoinGecko, with a minor 24-hour decline of 1.0% and a seven-day loss of 1.2%. These fluctuations are part and parcel of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility, and the formation of the ascending triangle adds an intriguing dimension to XRP’s price action. 1/ Extensive performance testing of the XLS-30 #AMM has now been completed. XLS-30 is a proposed amendment as part of the rippled 1.12.0 upgrade. If adopted, it will bring automated swap, trading, and liquidity provisioning capabilities to the #XRPLedger.https://t.co/Cz1w76uc8c — RippleX (@RippleXDev) October 6, 2023 In addition to the technical aspects, recent data from an XRP report has revealed a noteworthy surge in XRP’s active addresses. On October 8, active addresses surged to 24,400, a significant increase from the previous day’s figure of just 13,100. This surge indicates that over 10,000 additional users decided to engage with the XRP blockchain, a development that has caught the attention of market observers. XRP market cap currently at $27.4 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com XRP’s Potential Evolution The surge in active addresses may be linked to RippleX’s recent announcement. On October 6, RippleX, the developer arm of the Ripple network and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), confirmed the successful completion of performance testing for XLS-30 AMM (Automated Market Maker). Related Reading: Assessing Cardano’s Struggles: Will Key Support Levels Halt The Decline Above $0.27?

XRP enthusiasts will undoubtedly be watching closely to see how these dynamics unfold. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

The sell-off in the U.S. Treasuries appears overdone, with prices trading at a significant discount to their 200-day simple moving average and yields at multi-year highs. Bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction.  Historically, oversold Treasury notes have presaged major volatility explosions in various corners of the global financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, according to BofA Securities.  ""Bonds oversold: Treasuries trading >5% below 200dma; note oversold sell-offs all coincided/foreshadowed ""events”: Oct’87 crash, May’94 Tequila crisis, Jun’99 internet bubble, Mar’21 crypto pop, Oct'22 Nasdaq pop,"" BofA analysts said in a note titled ""The Price of Money"" sent to clients on Oct. 5.  Traders worldwide closely tracked the U.S. Treasury market since it affects global liquidity conditions. Falling bond prices and rising yields tend to drain money from other risk assets, as observed over the past 18 months.  The chart shows U.S. Treasury prices relative to their 200-day SMA with +2 and -2 standard deviation lines marking overbought and oversold levels.  The latest oversold reading looks analogous to the one observed in early 2021, following which bitcoin rose to new record highs above $60,000. By the end of May 2021, bitcoin fell back to $30,000.

The DOJ has been discussing issues that may be raised during witness testimony in Bankman-Fried's trial, and the parties ""have reached agreement on many of these issues,"" said a filing. One area they remain apart on is whether the defense team can raise any issues around the Anthropic fundraise. The DOJ alleges that the $500 million investment in Anthropic in 2022 came from customer funds.  ""Evidence regarding the current value of the defendant’s investments could only be used to support the argument that FTX customers and/or other victims will ultimately be made whole, which the Court has recognized is an impermissible purpose,"" the filing said.  Recap: Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison to Testify Tuesday in Sam Bankman-Fried Trial  The DOJ has previously tried to bar Bankman-Fried's defense team from arguing that FTX creditors will receive most or all of their funds back.  ""The Indictment alleges that the defendant committed wire fraud by misappropriating FTX customer deposits to make investments and other expenditures. It is immaterial whether some of those investments might ultimately have been profitable,"" the DOJ filing said. ""... Nor would it be a defense to the charges in this case if the defendant invested stolen FTX money believing that the investments would ultimately be so lucrative that he could pay back the stolen money.""  Anthropic has an agreement with Amazon worth potentially up to $4 billion and is in talks to raise another $2 billion, Bloomberg reported last week.  FTX took a stake in Anthropic that was worth $500 million when it filed for bankruptcy nearly a year ago. The company's bankruptcy trustee has yet to sell the stake.
