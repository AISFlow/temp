42405329,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLyta,1603835474,"'A Race Toward Zero': With Hashrate in the Clouds, Bitcoin Mining Is Less Profitable Than Ever","Bitcoin mining profitability is in the basement, seeing all-time lows in 2020.  Conversely, bitcoin's hashrate has surged throughout 2020, propelled in part by mining farms financing new hardware to boost their operations.  Bitcoin's hashrate has taken a dip as China's wet season comes to an end, but mining professionals predict this will only be temporary, and it has only improved profit margins so much.    Bitcoin mining profits have been rock bottom in 2020.      For much of the year, the cryptocurrency has been less profitable to mine than ever. And that’s because Bitcoin’s collective hashrate – or how much computing power is pulsing through the network – has surged to consecutive all-time highs this year.      Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works      According to North American bitcoin mining company Luxor’s hashprice index, miners are extracting $0.096 for every terahash they produce (before the recent price spike, it was lower still at roughly $0.08). This time three years ago, miners could expect to make roughly $1.40. Their revenue in October of 2019, though several magnitudes less than what they were raking in during 2017’s market mania, was still double today’s cash flows at $0.16.      Coming into 2020, miners were producing approximately 90 exahashes a second (or 83,000,000,000,000,000,000 cryptographic numbers a second in an effort to generate new blocks). Now, they are producing roughly 124 EH/s, after hitting an all time high of 157 EH/s in mid-October.      Bitcoin mining is a resource war of attrition, so naturally revenue margins are dwindling in a year when Bitcoin’s hashrate is exploding. And ASIC financing could largely be to blame.      The practice, whereby big operations can take out loans to bulk-order newer-generation hardware, floods the network with fresh hashrate. The surge in hashrate has meant more competition than ever for the digital gold rush – and with fewer bits to go around, small-time miners are having trouble keeping up.    Bitcoin’s hashrate and mining revenue are inversely proportional    Luxor Mining pool operator Ethan Vera told CoinDesk the anemic miner revenue is a direct result of the Bitcoin system’s growing hashrate, its relatively stagnant price and lower-than-usual transaction fees.      According to Luxor's index, the seven-day hashrate average is currently resting at 124 exahashes a second, and Vera said this “is largely due to Bitmain S19s and Whatsminer M30s being delivered to the market in large quantities.”      Read more: Bitcoin Miner Revenue Saw 11% Drop in September      It’s not unusual, of course, for miner revenue to decline when hashrate is going vertical. But Bitcoin’s stellar increase in hashrate in 2020, a nearly 30% increase this year, is the result of accelerated investment in the industry. Much of this growth comes from ASIC financing, wherein miners take out loans to buy the best new-generation mining equipment.      The mining finance industry, populated by key players including Blockfills, Arctos, BlockFi, SBI, DCG and Galaxy Digital, continues to grow. Increased competition has led to lower rates, Vera said, with some miners being able to secure sub 10% interest loans. Just a year or so ago, the common rate was 20%.      “A number of North American companies have been in the news recently for large hardware purchases, particularly RIOT Blockchain and Bitfarms. Foundry has also popped up recently and offering financing options for ASIC miners,” Thomas Heller, the COO of mining media firm HASHR8, told CoinDesk.      Most recently, CoinDesk reported on Marathon Patent Group’s purchase of 10,000 Antminer s-19s, which could pump an estimated 1.1 exhashes into the mining company’s operation. This is Marathon’s second bulk purchase from Bitmain this year after it scooped up 10,500 ASICs for $23 million in a deal with Bitmain this August.      Stephen Barbour, whose company, Upstream Data, provides oil drillers with mining rigs that run on vented natural gas, sees this as detrimental to Bitcoin mining’s short-to-near-term health. In some cases, he told CoinDesk, the big players aren’t always optimized for profitability because they have financial cushions.      “These guys can rent out an old mine, operate at a loss and then recapitalize,” he told CoinDesk, referring to these firms’ abilities to take out new loans or woo new investors when they need to shore up finances.      A look at one such firm, RIOT Blockchain, makes Barbour’s point. The publicly traded company purchased thousands of ASICs this year in a herculean (if quixotic) effort to quadruple its hashrate by 2021. As of June 2020, Riot had net operating losses of nearly $15 million, according to SEC filings. Riot clocked a similar loss in the first half of 2019, and Marathon posted $3.2 million in losses for the first half of 2020.      Northern AG, another publicly traded mining operation, had a net income of -$8.7 million in 2019 and -$5.6 million in 2018. Even the profitable ones, like the likewise public industrial miner Hut 8, barely eked out a profit in 2019: after generating $83 million in revenue, Hut 8 pocketed just $2.1 million after debt obligations and other expenses.      Disregarding profit, these miners continue to expand in hopes of future spoils, but this very activity is sending Bitcoin’s hashrate skyward, Barbour argues.      “These guys can get these big loans and they are effectively operating at a loss, and it’s propping up the hashrate.”    Retail miners feeling the heat    As these big mining farms scale irrespective of profit, Bitcoin’s hashrate pumps, and smaller players are having a hard time keeping up with the suped-up competition.      “It's becoming increasingly challenging for small miners to compete for both hosting and hardware purchases, because lower prices are available for those orders with larger volume,” Heller said.      Vera said, “There is still a large retail market in China that can access sub $0.04 cent power during the rainy season in the Sichuan province. But outside of China, retail mining has declined significantly.”      That rainy season, which provides gushes of cheap power to Chinese miners, is coming to an end, and with it, Bitcoin’s hashrate has taken a 12% hit to 124 exahashes. Heller said this dip, which happens annually, will “only be temporary” as the older machines migrate to areas like South America, Kazakhstan, Russia and Iran.      Read more: Iran Is Ripe for Bitcoin Adoption, Even as Government Clamps Down on Mining      The miners buying these rigs aren’t concerned with profit, Vera says. “They have other reasons for it,” he said, “such as to avoid capital controls or avoid sanctions.”      For others who are trying to turn a profit, bitcoin’s recent price bump to $13.6K will help a bit, and further upward price action would widen these miners’ revenue margins.      Price may only be part of the solution, though; addressing the competitive discrepancy may also require new market tools to shift hashrate distribution. At least, that’s the idea behind Compass, a service by HASHR8 that matches retail miners with mining farms to host their equipment. Compass wants to make it easier for these miners to find a facility, thereby lowering the barrier of entry to the process and (hopefully) finding the most economical setups for individual miners.    A problem for the Bitcoin mining market (and time)    Something like Compass may help smaller miners break into the game. Or maybe the problem will resolve itself when the market does its thing.      “I think in the long term you’ll see more of these massive operations fail,” Barbour told CoinDesk.      A pumping hashrate is always “a terrible thing for miners,” Barbour said, and it may be a degree worse for the little guys, considering “they don’t have the advantage of economies of scale like the bigger guys,” Barbour continued.      But that doesn’t mean it’s easy on the big players, either. After all, more hardware means more operational overhead as well as a mountain of debt to pay off for the financed ASICs.      To sum up the situation with an idiom, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. And Barbour thinks the mining giants’ time is coming.      “I think all of these financed operations are a part of what I call the ‘discovery phase’ for this industry. I think we’ll see more of them in the near term but they’ll struggle [in the] long term, and I think their operations will fracture and splinter.”      He continued that, unlike smaller mining operators like himself who have “skin in the game,” these financed operations were launched on the back of someone else’s buck. While this does not guarantee these businesses will be run in spite of profit, it does mean the operators have less at stake than their small business counterparts.      Read more: Marathon Brings New Bitcoin Mining Rigs Online, Sees Itself Becoming Cash-Flow Positive      Still, Vera pointed out, not all of these operations are the same and these operations' likelihood for success “depends on the interest rate and the operating cost of the borrow.” He added that interest rates around 10% are probably favorable for some of these miners, while any borrowing above that could be unsustainable.    'A race toward zero'    For those firms that aren’t profitable, though, you may be asking why they are operating at all. Barbour told CoinDesk that they’re essentially “speculating on [the price ripping upward]”; they’ve ordered all this new-gen hardware to frontrun the bull run and are gambling that this run will come sooner rather than later.      Yet again, it could all come down to a waiting game of attrition, Barbour says, and the price might not matter that much in the long run. Per ""Moore’s Law"", which stipulates that computer processing improves exponentially, ASIC mining hardware will continue to improve towards maximum efficiency.      Eventually, Barbour argues, the new-gen stuff won’t be much more efficient than the old gen, so miners who can mass order machines won’t have an advantage. As miners continue to search for the cheapest, near-free electricity, Barbour believes the mega-operations will eventually be priced out because the upside won't be there to justify the use of capital.      “They'd be better off just buying bitcoin ... Anytime there’s a drive for cheap power, it drives down the profitability for everyone. It’s a race toward zero,” Barbour said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/27/a-race-toward-zero-with-hashrate-in-the-clouds-bitcoin-mining-is-less-profitable-than-ever,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f75a6a930dfcb4d31a065893105e3be0bc9f9c9-2124x1411.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MicroStrategy bought $250 million in bitcoin (BTC) on Aug. 11. It purchased an additional $175 million in bitcoin one month after that. Bitcointreasuries.org says the business intelligence firm now holds 38,250 BTC, or 0.182% of bitcoin's total supply.      With the recent rise in BTC's price, its holdings are now worth $521 million, a 22% premium over the $425 million investment.      Now it wants more.

On a non-GAAP basis, the company posted a profit of $19.8 million, or $2.06 per share, up from $11.6 million, or $1.13 a year ago.      Besides the 22% return on its BTC investment, the company has seen another benefit from its foray into cryptocurrency – increased visibility.      ""We've seen a notable and unexpected benefit from our investment in bitcoin in elevating the profile of the company in the broader market, Li said. ""This is benefitting our reputation overall, raising our mindshare among prospective customers.""      CEO Michael Saylor, who has vocally championed BTC since early September, further explained during the earnings call that MicroStrategy's bitcoin reserves are paying dividends across recruiting, marketing and the MicroStrategy brand. He also compared the bitcoin network to ""a digital monetary network that doesn't bleed monetary energy.""      ""As more entities start to understand that idea, which is pretty compelling, the adoption of bitcoin increases,"" he said.      The executive's statement caps a wild three months at the business intelligence firm; executives first hinted at a bitcoin future in the firm's Q2 call. MicroStrategy’s share has risen over 40% since Saylor’s first bitcoin disclosure on Aug. 11.      Share price aside, the bitcoin storyline has definitely boosted the company's profile. The shift began on July 28, when during the Q2 earnings call executives mulled allocating $250 million into “alternative assets” over the next 12 months as a hedge against the weakening dollar.      Bitcoin, they said, was one of the possible “alternatives.” It turned out to be the only alternative.      All this from a company whose business model has nothing to do with crypto.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $13,668 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $13,008-$13,756  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price was on a steady run upward Tuesday, hitting as high as $13,756.33 before settling down to $13,668, according to CoinDesk 20 data. It is now within reach of its 2019 high of $13,879.24; any point above that puts bitcoin prices where they were during the late 2017-early 2018 bull run and subsequent collapse. Increased spot bitcoin volume, at $840 million, helped lead the price higher Tuesday. That figure has averaged $432 million daily over the past month.      Read More: Bitcoin Hits 16-Month High Despite Sell-Off in Global Stocks      Micah Erstling, trader at crypto liquidity provider GSR, said bitcoin has broken away from stocks, at least temporarily, not long after the world’s oldest cryptocurrency took a short dip Monday when stocks also fell. “Bitcoin quickly broke the correlation to stocks after yesterday’s plunge, rallying back even as stocks remained tepid,” he said. Indeed, major equity indexes were flat or down Tuesday.    The Nikkei 225 in Asia ended the day flat, in the red 0.04%, as the index recovered from early losses but coronavirus concerns outweighed positive sentiment.  The FTSE 100 closed in the red 1.1% as record-high coronavirus cases and uncertainty regarding Brexit talks led the index lower.  In the United States the S&P 500 was flat, down 0.10% as lawmakers struggled to push coronavirus-related fiscal stimulus forward ahead of the Nov. 3 election.    “Most risk-on assets were impacted by news of a stimulus stalemate and rising virus numbers,” Erstling noted. “Traders are shaking off that sentiment today and returning to the long-term fundamentals that have propelled bitcoin to an over-85% gain"" for the year to date.      “We’ve seen increased buying activity over the last two weeks,” said Michael Rabkin, head of Institutional Sales at crypto market maker DV Chain. “On top of that, the U.S. is close to approving a record $1.8 trillion stimulus plan. People are looking at alternatives like bitcoin to protect their wealth.”      Judging by the bitcoin options market’s open interest, positive sentiment seems to be picking up. Monday saw bitcoin options open interest crack $2.5 billion for the second time in October, with the first time being last Thursday, Oct. 22.      ""Based on the bitcoin options data, a lot of traders are hedging and locking-in profits and current price levels,” Daniel Koehler, liquidity manager at San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, told CoinDesk. “Volumes are up across the board along with the price, so it is a sign of increased near-term bullish bias.”    Ether volatility up    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Tuesday, trading around $406 and climbing 3.7% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Ether’s volatility, measured by the standard deviation of daily log returns on an annualized basis, has been much higher than bitcoin's volatility in 2020. While ether’s volatility had been dropping in October, it crept back up again, going from 49.99% Sunday to 51.75% Monday.      Ether itself is up over 210% in 2020, while bitcoin has risen over 88% this year so far. Quant trading firm QCP Capital on Tuesday noted ether’s market risks and its potential to underperform over the balance of 2020 due to exploitation of decentralized finance, or DeFi.      Read More: Harvest Finance - $24M Attack Triggers $570M ‘Bank Run’      “ETH has been hit yet again by DeFi worries after another smart contract platform exploitation/hack – this time Harvest,” QCP wrote in its weekly investor note. “This will weigh further on ETH and could cause it to underperform BTC in the near term.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Tuesday.

42405322,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLyof,1603829632,'Convincing' Phishing Attack Targets Ledger Hardware Wallet Users,"Customers of Ledger, the hardware cryptocurrency wallet, are being targeted by a phishing attack posing as an email from Ledger support.      On Sunday a Reddit user posted in the r/ethfinance subreddit, alerting the group to the existence of the attack.      The fake email ostensibly informs users their Ledger assets may be compromised. It states, “Our forensics team has found several of the Ledger Live administrative servers to be infected with malware.” This claim is false; while the email form looks professional, it is a phishing attempt to steal customers data.      See also: Crypto Wallet Maker Ledger Loses 1M Email Addresses in Data Theft      The email is so convincing that even wary users might be fooled. Ledger confirmed that, for the last week, a phishing attack has been targeting Ledger cryptocurrency wallet customers.      “I received the same email and for once I got really confused. Everything checks out,” said one Reddit user in reply to the original post. “However, there you can see that the url is incorrect (notice the dot on the second 'e' => ledgėr). What triggered my doubt was that I received the email twice within a couple of minutes. ... It's probably related to the previous hack where a hacker managed to get our email addresses.”      Another user replied, “Wow this looked really legit, so much so I used Contact Us form to ask Ledger if it was real. I am normally pretty good at sniffing things like this out – this was by far the most convincing attempt I have ever seen.”      See also: YouTube’s Whac-a-Mole Approach to Crypto Scam Ads Remains a Problem    Roots of a phishing attack    In July, the Ledger team discovered an API key related to their e-commerce and marketing database was exploited, and the database accessed by an unauthorized third party. The database details (mostly email addresses) were used to send order confirmations and promotional emails.      In a blog post revealing the hack, the Ledger team emphasized that users' payment information and crypto funds are safe.      CoinDesk independently reviewed one of these phishing emails, which was sent from ""support@legder.com."" A key clue in any phishing email is a slight misspelling of a real address or URL; in this instance, “ledger.com” is misspelled.    Pro tip: Bookmark verified sites where you normally would input sensitive information and only access them through that bookmarked link.    Phishing attacks are common and attackers are increasingly sophisticated, creating emails that resemble official company correspondence. They rely on a person making a mistake and clicking on a link that could compromise his or her security.      See also: Social Engineering: A Plague on Crypto and Twitter, Unlikely to Stop      In a statement, a Ledger spokesperson said an internal task force has been deployed to investigate the latest phishing attack.      “The investigation is ongoing and at this time we cannot give any additional information but one thing is for certain: Ledger will never ask you for your 24-word recovery phrase, which is a blatant sign of a phishing scam,” said the spokesperson. “Ledger encourages customers to exercise caution as phishing attacks become more sophisticated and to alert Ledger's customer support team and consult Ledger.com for more information on the detection of scams.”      UPDATE (November 2, 2020, 17:46 UTC): Multiple Ledger users have shared that they are also being targeted by SMS phishing attacks, sent to their phones. CoinDesk has seen three separate examples of this phishing text below.      This is a phishing attempt and customers should not click on the link. The development further highlights customers concerns about how data stemming from the Ledger hack earlier this year is being used.      UPDATE: November 2, 2020 (19:56 UTC) Ledger responded with the following comment: ""As soon as we discovered the data breach on Ledger's website in July 2020, we immediately patched it. Since then, we led two penetration tests with a third-party consultancy to verify and improve the security of our clients' data. For two weeks, some of Ledger's customers have been experiencing continuous phishing scams through various channels, including email and SMS. We've issued several scam alerts through our Twitter, email, and other channels to notify our users during the past two weeks.      The internal task force is investigating these attacks, and as of now, we can't state that scammers are using Ledger's marketing database, and therefore, these attacks resulted from July's data breach.""",NEGATIVE,없음,WALLET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/27/convincing-phishing-attack-targets-ledger-hardware-wallet-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f8dbcf82c6cad882d68e1116175d3984b021d3a-1500x852.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405326,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLysb,1603826879,An Internet for Humans: Proof-of-Personhood Explained,"Identity is one of our most fundamental human rights. Yet, in the age of surveillance, commodification and centralization, it is under threat. Edward Snowden said it best, ""The one vulnerability being exploited across all systems is identity.""      If the “State is the monopoly on violence,” as Max Weber once defined it, then the surveillance state (or surveillance capital) is the monopoly on identity. In this time of rising surveillance capitalism, entrenched surveillance states and, more recently, the plutocracy of blockchain networks, this monopoly has never been more important to break. Despite the growing public awareness of these issues, there is little discussion of the fact that these seemingly disparate phenomena all trace back to identity. Authentication systems are the key pathway through which these networks lock-in their subjects into extractive, scarcity-based, economic and social contracts.    Paula Berman is a co-founder of Democracy Earth, a nonprofit researching and building open source software for governance and identity. Divya Siddarth is a researcher at Microsoft’s Office of the CTO, and also with the RadicalXChange Foundation. She works on a broad range of research and applications in the space of participative technology and democratized governance.This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series, an examination at the technologies developed today that will power the economy of tomorrow.    Major internet platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Google established themselves partially by achieving a sufficient level of consensus over their legitimacy as credential providers – taking over a role that has, in the modern era, been the exclusive purview of the state. Despite their many faults, Web 2.0 platforms formed a new, networked social infrastructure for humanity, or a layer of trust where a myriad of social applications were built.      See also: Michael Casey – The Crypto-Surveillance Capitalism Connection      This new global identification system outside of strict state control bred a new kind of digital, participative politics. Yet, the underlying architecture and ownership structure of these centralized identity protocols exposed society to surveillance, political manipulation and data theft. Consolidated credential mechanisms today all implement practices that require the disclosure of personal and private information to an identifier. Eventually, this wealth of data accrues into credential monopolies, a perfect apparatus for anti-democratic practices.      Despite initial excitement, we find that blockchains simply have not deviated much from these norms. Most crypto networks validate membership by employing either proof-of-stake, which requires ownership of a given cryptocurrency and results in a ""one-dollar-one-vote"" governance model, or proof-of-work, requiring ownership and use of mining hardware, and resulting in a ""one-CPU-one-vote"" system. These are not truly consensus mechanisms, as they are usually referred to – to determine how members vote, Bitcoin employs the Nakamoto Consensus while Ethereum uses GHOST – but instead are identity solutions, or credentialing mechanisms that grant membership and governance rights over these networks. Based on the possession of scarce resources, they are prone to monopoly formation, creating plutocracies and re-centralizing power within systems originally conceptualized as distributive and free.      Clearly, these systems understand that identity is a crucial part of the problem, but have not yet provided effective solutions for a human-centered, empowered and democratic society. Authentication mechanisms fundamentally shape socioeconomic, sociopolitical and socio-technical systems – and if there was ever a time to spotlight it that time is now when those systems are breaking.    While Web 2.0 served, to an extent, to democratize content, it failed to drive meaningful political inclusion.    Providing such a spotlight was the intent of our recent review focusing on one of the most enigmatic problems in cryptography: proof-of-personhood protocols. These are new types of privacy-preserving authentication mechanisms that aim to shield digital networks from identity fraud,a pursuit that could have profound political and economic implications.      While Web 2.0 served, to an extent, to democratize content, it failed to drive meaningful political inclusion, partly due to a lack of protections against the creation of fake identities. Online votes can be, and often are, attacked by illegitimate accounts. Blockchain networks have similarly decentralized the creation of money, but the possibility of distributing this value equitably (e.g. in the form of a Universal Basic Income) was equally hampered by the lack of robust identity frameworks that could safeguard these currencies from attackers creating fake accounts to obtain more than their fair share of value. Addressing this foundational problem is the raison d'etre of Proof of Personhood.      See also: Galen Wolfe-Pauly – The Digital Archipelago: How to Build an Internet Where Communities Thrive      Key to understanding how this type of protocol operates (and why it's so improbably exciting!) is an old unsolved challenge of the internet. You might not have heard of the term ""Sybil attack"" before: It’s been a pervasive problem, with iterations ranging from SPAM attacks to automated disinformation through bots. Once thought to be impossible to overcome, this type of vulnerability is present in scenarios where, lacking any intermediaries that can verify identities, anyone with sufficient resources can attack and control a network by joining it with multiple, illegitimate virtual personas.      In the context of identity, this threat was best synthesized by Vitalik Buterin, who referred to it as the ""unique human problem,"" or the challenge to ensure that each unique person can only create one account within a given domain. In that sense, anti-Sybil identities are not designed to obtain any particular information about users, other than that they are not defrauding the protocol with fake accounts. By focusing on this specific quest for “uniqueness” (also known as Sybil-resistance), proof-of-personhood shifts the prevailing perspective on authentication. Instead of asking ""who are you"" – and then unilaterally exploiting and monetizing that personal data – it limits itself to ""is this the only account you control?""      The result is nothing short of extraordinary: a digital web of humans, emancipated from identity intermediaries.      To formalize such unique online personas, new solutions entirely abstract objective markers of identity (such as name and nationality), which can easily be controlled, aggregated, repackaged, manipulated and subverted; instead favoring the use of subjective, human inputs (such as interpreting, conversing, or vouching), which are more elusive, and more impervious to undue interference.      The first generation of solutions for these types of threats converge under the CAPTCHA test, which was designed to protect platforms from bots or DDoS attacks. Yet, the crucial problem with CAPTCHAs is they are algorithmically generated, and thus can always eventually be solved algorithmically. In fact, each of our responses to these tests is utilized to train the pattern recognition capacities of AI, so these systems are effectively facilitating a perennial stream of information that flows from us humans, towards machine intelligence (and Silicon Valley overlords).      Some proof-of-personhood protocols are designed to directly invert this logic: instead of being generated and solved by computation, they are created and unlocked exclusively by the distinctive cognitive abilities of human brains. Such tests work with common-sense reasoning or cooperative games, which are easy for humans to perform but difficult for AI to replicate. A prominent example here is Idena, a fully decentralized blockchain in which members gather periodically for authentication ceremonies where they solve the FLIP test, and earn token rewards for proving unique personhood. Having established a network where every node corresponds to a unique human (currently at 4,556 members), Idena is already being utilized as a base for Universal Basic Income and decentralized governance applications.      See also: Finn Brunton – A Day in the Life of the Splinternet      On the other end of the spectrum, we have Web-of-Trust-type solutions, such as BrightID, where members vouch for each other and different applications can establish their own parameters to analyze the resulting social graph and determine which identities they consider to be unique. Additional strategies include formalizing credentials in offline gatherings (personhood.online and Duniter), deriving metrics from DAO participation (Upala and Democracy Earth's Equality Protocol), using crypto-economic incentives to reward legitimate behavior (HumanityDAO) and even distributed digital courts where randomly selected jurors adjudicate cases in which the legitimacy of an identity is contested (Kleros).      What unites these different approaches goes beyond a strong emphasis on privacy. In contrast to hyper-individualistic applications such as dark markets, where anonymity comes at the expense of accountability, these protocols are designed to foster prosocial, community-oriented behavior, where both users and applications are significantly limited in their ability to exploit and attack each other.      Paradoxically, the constraints they impose lead to unprecedented levels of both individual and collective agency. For the first time, they are creating a viable framework for social applications to be constructed upon an enduring bedrock of collective agency, consent and data dignity. In doing so, the heightened assurances and social richness of the offline world can be harnessed by online environments – moving them away from the current wild west paradigm of power concentration, inaccessibilities, fake identities and distorted social signaling. This dramatically expands the pathways through which trust can be consolidated in our increasingly digital societies, which could lead to a new, innovative iteration of the networked social infrastructure that was once created by the social media credentials of the Web 2.0.    Identity isn’t just objective, it is also subjective. As we experience and live it, identity is a rich patchwork of interactions, perceptions and intersectionalities.    With the exception of protecting against digital feudalism, there are no specific economic models or ideological inclinations that are embedded into proof-of-personhood protocols: they provide fertile ground for a diverse and pluralistic online ecosystem.      However, in their earliest applications, proof-of-personhood networks are already manifesting several of cypherpunk's most far-fetched dreams. Universal Basic Income cryptocurrencies, peer-to-peer democracies and public goods funding are simply a few of these newly piloted applications — which are now for the first time operationally possible. Human-only networks make space for cooperative and collective modes of economic functioning, rather than the default of extraction and individualism. We note, of course, that these are currently operating on reduced scales, still either too-fragile or too-complex for widespread adoption. That said, their creation is opening a path where alternatives to Surveillance Capitalism can be crafted with solid incentive systems and enduring economic foundations.      Crucially, these alternatives counter the logic of what we might call AI Realism (after Mark Fisher’s capitalist realism): the belief that our current surveillance apparatus, and the political economies that have come to support themselves upon it, is the only possible paradigm for technological, economic and political development. Some even have the audacity to describe surveillance as an evolutionary process, where humans will eventually merge with centrally-controlled AI!      Infused with this type of thinking, current discussions surrounding how to address these challenges either point to the inherently defeatist path of regulation or the narrowly liberal response of paying individuals for their data – mechanisms that can legitimate the rendering of personal experiences as behavioral assets ""for the sake of others’ improved control of us,"" as Shoshana Zuboff warns. These solutions seem to ignore that the situation at hand cannot be reduced to the traditional domains of ""monopoly"" or ""individual privacy"" but instead concern the fundamental protection of our collective human agency and value – the ability to give or deny consent, to move beyond atomized ownership and to fully participate in society.      The so-called objective conception of formalized identity leads to similarly rigid, individualistic, and mechanistically driven political economies. But identity isn’t just objective, it is also subjective. As we experience and live it, identity is a rich patchwork of interactions, perceptions and intersectionalities.      See also: Self-Sovereign Identity Explained      Formalizing identity in the subjective sense allows for new modes of coordination and collectivization, different formations of digital communities with real, effective and open governance, and the ability to selectively or wholly bring ourselves into new spaces and prospects.      Striving for these possibilities is the imperative task ahead of us. While surveillance capitalism and the ideology of AI bear a worldview that downgrades human value and dignity in favor of machine learning algorithms, proof-of-personhood protocols based on subjectivity enable us to reorient our systems from a technocratic and mechanistic paradigm. We move towards enshrining the attributes that make us human: our collective, unpredictable and diverse set of needs and innovations. In doing so, they counter the misleading logic of AI realism by formalizing a structure for flourishing, regenerative and newly possible human futures, where subjectivity is not only employed as a necessity, but as a strength.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,"Paula Berman, Divya Siddarth",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/27/an-internet-for-humans-proof-of-personhood-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b46bc783cb3f6dc4c3bb640c07b6e6c8d0ebe62-2048x1230.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405333,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLwin,1603817851,This Paradigm-Backed Startup Is Offering DeFi's First 'T-Bill',"“What is the time value of money?”      That’s the age-old question Allan Niemerg, former head of research and investments at Cumberland DRW and founder of newly launched Paradigm-incubated Yield Protocol, is trying to answer with his new programmatic money market.      Released publicly Oct. 19, Yield is jostling to join a $2.6 billion decentralized lending industry dominated by established players such as Compound by providing a benchmark product others have not: a DeFi yield curve.      And while money markets aren't always a head-turning topic, they do perform a useful function by allowing investors to plan for the future. In that sense, Yield as an abstract product can be seen as a cornerstone to long-term, blockchain-based money markets.    Stable versus variable    DeFi predominantly offers variable rates. Those that offer fixed rates such as Aave charge a premium due to the young market’s volatility. Yield, on the other hand, provides stable long-term borrowing and lending options. Version one has six different contracts extending through December 2021.      It’s all made possible by mashing together multiple existing projects plus some novel mathematics, Niemerg said in a phone interview.      “We took the example of Uniswap and a few others that exist,” Niemerg said. “We generalize how you actually construct markets like this. What you're doing is starting from some principle. This market should maintain some property and if it maintains that property we can put boundaries on how much it could lose.”      Niemerg said his product is akin to a Treasury bill (T-bill). The project’s white paper describes Yield loans as a “zero-coupon bond” (a financial instrument that trades at a discount if interest rates are positive until it pays off at face value at expiry).      To do this, Yield employs the automated market maker (AMM) scheme that came into vogue with Uniswap this summer. Prices in Uniswap and other similar markets are parameterized, meaning prices are a function of asset reserves (a bonding curve in DeFi speak, also known as your run-of-the-mill algebraic equation). For example, Uniswap’s curve is X * Y = K, where X and Y are pooled asset reserves and K is the price.  “The key thing is to identify properties then code them in the math so the markets reflect these properties and can trade at reasonable prices,” Niemerg said.    Yield space    But instead of the Yield AMM creating a price only through the balancing of reserves, it creates an interest rate by including a new variable: time.  “We want to build a liquidity provision formula that works in ‘yield space’ rather than ‘price’ space. Specifically, we want the interest rate – not the price – to be a pure function of reserves,” the Yield white paper states.      In practice, this looks like many other DeFi lending schemes: You deposit ether (ETH) as collateral in exchange for the protocol’s token, fixed-yield dai (fyDai). (Deposits are placed in a MakerDAO vault.) That token can then be swapped for dai into one of the six borrowing contracts with different expiry dates and stable rates. Each contract has its own specific token.      Much like how a traditional T-bill trades, the difference between dai and fyDai during that period is an implicit interest rate. The math behind fyDai should make the token trade at a discount to dai until the borrowing period closes and the two tokens reach parity.      If you buy a typical T-bill before expiry, you can expect a set return when the contract comes due. Likewise, if you buy fyTokens with dai (lending), you can expect a set return when the contract expires. The larger difference here being, of course, is the risk profile: government bonds are backed ultimately by the full faith and credit of the federal government, while fyDai is backed by software.    Is DeFi ready for a yield curve?    The product market fit for stable interest rates in DeFi is an unexplored question, DeFi market UMA co-founder and former Goldman Sachs bond trader Hart Lambur told CoinDesk in a phone interview. (Lambur maintains relationships with both Paradigm and Yield, but does have a competing project, the Yield Dollar, he said).      Lambur said Yield is “really elegant in theory” but he’s unsure if DeFi investors are asking for a stable interest rate product right now. Yield may be looking for a future market event for it to make sense, he said (though he noted that any project has traction if investors are willing to buy and sell on Yield at given prices).      Yet, stable interest rates are in demand in some places. The contract has a nudge over $750,000 in total value locked (TLV) as of Oct. 22, Niemerg said, and Yield may cut into the lending market by offering more attractive rates.      For example, Aave founder Stani Kulechov told CoinDesk in an email that “most of the borrowings from Aave Protocol are in variable interest rates.” He said Aave has seen an uptick in the utilization of stable borrowing rates to over 13%.      “This is a clear sign that borrowers are increasingly interested in having certainty in their interest rates,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | UNI,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/27/this-paradigm-backed-startup-is-offering-defis-first-t-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6aafd8ccf92c423e225b7f4c12ee3e4251e86e98-1192x785.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Southeast Asia's largest bank by assets, DBS, is eyeing a digital assets exchange. And bitcoin’s recent rise shows a decoupling from traditional markets, like the S&P 500.    Top shelf    JPM Coin JPM Coin, the enterprise-minded digital asset stewarded by the titular global bank, will see its first transaction this week, a JPMorgan executive said. Designed for wholesale payments and faster transactions, the system is predicted to save the banking industry hundreds of millions of dollars a year. First revealed in February 2019, JPM Coin will run on Quorum, a private version of Ethereum developed by the bank but acquired by development firm ConsenSys in August. Further, the executive told CNBC the bank has created a business unit with around 100 employees called Onyx to house related projects. “We believe we are shifting to a period of commercialization of those technologies, moving from research and development to something that can become a real business,” the executive said.      Bank’s exchange Southeast Asia's largest bank by assets, DBS, is apparently in the works to build a digital assets trading platform. The Singapore-based bank and financial services corporation posted – and quickly removed – a webpage detailing the DBS Digital Exchange that will offer access to ""an integrated ecosystem of solutions to tap the vast potential of private markets and digital currencies."" In addition to bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and XRP trading services, the exchange will also offer tokenization services, offering business the opportunity to raise funds by issuing digital forms of securities and assets, per the page. The exchange will be regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state's de facto central bank.      BTC funds bail A growing number of donors are giving crypto to bail funds, CoinDesk’s Ben Powers reports. Bail fund projects have taken in thousands of dollars in crypto donations – including major assets like BTC and ETH, as well as smaller market cap coins like BAT – since the summer, according to The Giving Block. Potential benefits include helping bail funds diversify payments streams, attract younger tech-savvy and international donors as well as tax benefits. “We expect that more people will embrace crypto as their preferred method of making donations – especially as people understand the tax benefits of giving via crypto, which are similar to those of donating conventional securities,” The Bail Project’s Chief Financial Officer Zach Herz-Roiphe said.      Volume surge Automated market makers Curve and Uniswap traded combined volumes above $4 billion on Monday, perhaps in reaction to a recent exploit of popular DeFi protocol Harvest Finance. Daily trading volume on Uniswap leapt 1,200% to a record $2.04 billion, surpassing the previous record high notched shy of $1 billion, while decentralized exchange Curve Finance saw volumes above $2 billion. This weekend, an attacker used a flash loan – a technique that allows a trader to take on massive leverage without any downside – draining some $24 million from Harvest and triggering a bank run. ""Volume on Uniswap surged, as the Harvest Finance exploiter likely ran money through the automated market maker,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of the research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Powell pontificates Jesse Powell, crypto OG and Kraken CEO, has criticized the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, in light of several recent multimillion-dollar exploits, not the least of which affected Harvest Finance yesterday. In a tweet on Tuesday, Powell said he would “not accept” DeFi projects’ attempts at “externalizing the cost” of “hasty reckless” rollouts. In an expletive-laden tweet he admonished these breakneck coders for rushing out unaudited and uninsured projects. Despite this, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair notes, the DeFi sector is continuing to grow, having surpassed $12.45 billion in total value locked up in smart contracts on Oct. 25. (That figure dropped by about $1.15 billion after Monday’s exploit of Harvest, and now stands at $11.3 billion, according to DeFi Pulse.)

CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole placed bitcoin’s new yearly watermark in the context of declining daily deposits to cryptocurrency exchanges as well as a movement of coins off exchanges.      According to Glassnode, the number of daily deposits to exchanges fell to a nine-month low of 26,889 on Monday as the total number of bitcoins held on exchanges slipped to a two-year low of 2,478,799 BTC.      These statistics, while imperfect, have traditionally pointed to a market sentiment where traders and investors are prepared to “hodl” into a rally, Godbole noted.      A similar sentiment can be gauged by looking at futures markets, where contracts give the option for buyers to strike a buy at a predetermined price by a predetermined date. According to Godbole’s analysis, one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of bearing to bullish bets are hovering near zero, an indication that some traders expect for bitcoin’s price to continue rising.      Last week, Bloomberg analysts put out a quarterly report on predictive crypto performance, targeting a $100,000 BTC price level for 2025 and a high of $14,000 as early as this year.      “Still in hangover mode from the 2017 rally, we don't know what specific catalyst might launch Bitcoin to new highs, but demand vs. supply metrics remain price-positive,” the analysts write in “Bitcoin Trend, Adding Zeros.”      Among the macro factors they point to is bitcoin’s decreasing volatility compared to the Nasdaq composite, a growing correlation with gold and a likely growing market cap, in part spurred by corporate investment (like MicroStrategy and Square’s) in the cryptocurrency.      “In an unparalleled macroeconomic backdrop of rapidly increasing fiscal and monetary stimulus, limited supply stores of value such as gold and Bitcoin stand to prevail, in our view. This should be true when traditional asset classes – stocks and bonds – are overextended,” the report reads.      A separate report by CoinDesk’s sister company Grayscale has found that more than half (55%) of U.S. investors who responded are interested in buying bitcoin in 2020. That’s up from 19% from survey responses last year.      For the short term? ""The next resistance to take out is $13,800 (June 2019 high),” Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG told Godbole.    Market intel    Decoupling? Bitcoin is riding at 16-month highs, trading around $13,420 at press time. The cryptocurrency is now up 25% for the month and 87% on a year-to-date basis, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. This comes as coronavirus scares and intermittent U.S. stimulus talks have spooked traditional markets, seen by the S&P 500’s 2% drop yesterday. “In effect, we appear to be seeing a weakening of the positive correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 seen since the March crash,” Godbole said.

42405302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLwds,1603814148,How a Decentralized Internet Can Power Latin America's Economy,"It's no secret Latin America's economy is not in great shape compared to other regions.      There isn’t any single reason for this. You could point to a dependence on commodity exports and its booms and bust cycles, government corruption, income inequality or a combination of them all.    Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar is the CEO and co-founder of IOVLabs, the blockchain development company responsible for Bitcoin’s smart contract network RSK and its infrastructure layer RIF. In 2019, he oversaw the acquisition of Taringa!, Latin America's largest Spanish-speaking social network. This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series.    The events of 2020 are likely to take a particular toll on the people of Latin America (LatAm). The OECD has previously warned the region has less “fiscal space” to navigate the economic impacts of the pandemic than it did before the last crisis in 2008.      However, I believe the tide is shifting. With the current trends linking connectivity, digital payments, fintech investment and decentralized finance (DeFi), it seems realistic that in the next 10 years bitcoin and DeFi dapps can provide Latin America with the means to leapfrog into a highly interconnected and efficient regional economy.    A decade of adoption    Unlike the European model that was built from the top down, this financial ecosystem is emerging from the grassroots. This trend is manifesting already in the case of Mexico that at moments had 5% of its U.S. remittances settled over cryptocurrencies and by the Venezuelan families abroad sending money home with bitcoin. Much like mobile phones disrupted the African economy, this new financial infrastructure has the potential to open up new markets, giving birth to a new, decentralized, peer-to-peer economy.      Within a decade I envision Latin America having a regional economy built from the ground up. An economy that can stand apart from oppressive government-driven fiscal policies – a true peer-to-peer system, driven by the people – and based on blockchain technology.      The relevance of technology adoption for the region is already manifesting. Currently, LatAm is leading the world in smartphone app usage, and network infrastructure is expanding rapidly to match. It's only a matter of time before examples from the digital gig economy like “virtual babysitters” begin to affect local business models for individuals and businesses.      See also: Why It’s Time to Pay Attention to Mexico’s Booming Crypto Market      In addition, online education is becoming more widely available, as recent initiatives such as Google’s online degree program demonstrate. I believe these advancements play a key role in LatAm catching up with more developed economies without going through intermediate stages of development.      What will it look like?      Many of the world’s most vulnerable populations and half of Latin America’s are denied access to basic financial services. Now, permissionless payment solutions and reputation-based digital identities are being developed, and they will serve as the pillars for economic transformation.    The coming years could be a newborn era of Latin America driven by a peer-to-peer digital economy.    The combination of the two will allow the unbanked to begin transacting regionally or even globally in a peer-to-peer manner, enabling the creation of new innovative business models with the added benefits of geographical arbitrage.      For example, online local food cooking classes will be transmitted over the internet to anywhere in the world, with payments conducted with bitcoin or highly adopted stablecoins.      People will no longer carry a physical ID, they will prove their identity and credentials by scanning a QR code or via online digital signatures. User interfaces will be based on apps and browsers, but powered by open blockchain networks, without users having to know or care about the infrastructure layers underneath.    No need to bank the unbanked    Along with digital identity, another enabler of the transition to a peer-to-peer economy is what is hyped today as DeFi. Latin America will unite economically through crypto-assets and economies that will become the region’s medium of exchange and store of value, becoming what could be thought of as a decentralized banking system.      Lending, borrowing, hedging and speculating will all be available for local residents in a simple and secure manner. And, perhaps most importantly, I believe LatAm residents will be able to obtain capital and revenue from a global audience of investors.      See also: Alejandro Machado - Venezuelans Look to Crypto-Dollars for Financial Security      For example, take my home city of Buenos Aires, where I’ve been working with local meetup groups to increase awareness of the digital and bitcoin economy since 2013. If one of these local communities develops an initiative that needs funds in order to evolve and grow future profits, they'll be able to tokenize the community's future income and therefore create financial incentives for global investors to assist them in their growth. Future revenues generated by the community will be shared with the investors, and incentives will stay aligned across all groups – making everybody happy.      Latin Americans stablecoin adoption will continue to thrive because it offers a means of doing business with others in the region across borders, without having to exchange national currencies or handle their volatility risks.    A decentralized internet – no longer a buzzword    By 2030, the social fabric of Latin America will also be transformed. On top of the distrust towards governmental institutions and politicians, we are also seeing a trend where people no longer trust today’s social media platforms driven by data harvesting and ad revenue. Enabled by the pillars of self-sovereign identity and a digital economy, I can imagine a future where, ultimately, a fully decentralized internet would give people control of their identity and data.      Taringa!, the largest Spanish-speaking social media platform in the world, is already experimenting with a new paradigm in decentralized social sharing economy – and might be the beginning of a broader transformation where other communities embrace new privacy-protecting and open business models.      See also: The Web Wasn’t Built for Privacy, but It Could Be      Imagine a fundamental departure from today, where a few tech giants are taking huge profits at the expense of both advertisers and end users. I can see a future where social media platforms consist of users who receive fair incentives directly aligned to the size and engagement of their followers. Where businesses can market their goods and services directly to consumers who want to buy them. One where the internet is powered by a shared, distributed “supercomputer” with no single points of failure.      Once individuals are given control of their data, they will also be able to profit from it. The new internet will be censorship-resistant, and an individual’s privacy will be fully protected. The users will be in control of the internet, as opposed to a few economic groups as it is today.      My home region is in a prime position right now. “Unprecedented” is a word that’s been overused in 2020, but it’s the only appropriate term to describe an opportunity to eliminate economic dependence on commodities for an entire region. After decades of suffering generalized corruption, financial volatility, high poverty levels and income inequality, the coming years could be a newborn era of Latin America driven by a peer-to-peer digital economy.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/27/how-a-decentralized-internet-can-power-latin-americas-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4c7ce3c2a4a2dbfd4b694af6bba47bb85e5d2fa-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405296,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLwXy,1603812288,China’s Coronavirus Outbreak Prompts Blockchain Adoption for Charity,"Tens of millions of dollars have been reportedly raised to help Wuhan, a city in central China with 11 million people, to recover from its coronavirus outbreak earlier this year. However, charities in China are not widely trusted.      Now, China’s digital payment and banking giants have been building blockchain-based platforms to tackle miscommunication between charities and the affected communities, as well as a lack of transparency in the current donation distribution system, CoinDesk Japan reported Monday.      Alibaba, parent of AliPay, released the technical framework and industry standards for blockchain platforms for charities in September. It plans to increase transparency by tracking donations on the company’s enterprise blockchain and make it easier for people to make donations via its authentication function.      Tencent also made an effort to record donations to a nationwide charity campaign on its enterprise blockchain TUSI. The annual campaign, held on Sept. 9 every year, raised over $3 billion from more than 43 million individuals and 14,000 companies in 2019, CoinDesk Japan reported.      The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), one of the major four state-owned commercial banks in China, included blockchain use cases for charities in a 2020 whitepaper on the technology’s adoption in the financial services industry.      “During recovery from the coronavirus outbreak, ICBC has launched and promoted blockchain platforms to track donations,” the bank said in the white paper. “The Red Cross Guangxi branch and Zhuhai Charity Headquarter are currently on our platform and we will gradually invite more organizations across the country.”    Trust crisis    These moves echo the State Council’s call to use emerging technologies, including blockchain, to improve the charity system in China and restore the general public’s trust in Chinese charities.      China’s Red Cross, one of the largest charities in the country, was criticized for not getting supplies to hospitals that were fighting the coronavirus in February. A state media outlet livestreamed a suited man loading a box of face masks into a truck with the characters on it saying “Vehicles for Government Officials” next to a Red Cross warehouse.

A woman named Guo Meimei claimed she worked for the Red Cross and angered Chinese netizens by showing off her lavish lifestyle on social media in 2011. Unsubstantiated rumors said she had connections with a high-ranking Chinese official in the Red Cross and misused some funds in the charity. The organization had received tens of millions of dollars in donations on the heels of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.      In its proposed policy in 2016, the Chinese Red Cross Foundation said it would set up an independent third-party institution to audit and supervise the management of its supplies and donations, according to a document on the State Council's official website.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/27/chinas-coronavirus-outbreak-prompts-blockchain-adoption-for-charity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6de1fda26028c97cb69136f79acf74ba49021f4e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405308,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLwjm,1603805129,First Mover: Bitcoin Surges to New 2020 High as Harvest Debacle Provides Costly DeFi Lesson,"Bitcoin reached a new 2020 high of around $13,420 after rising on nine of the past 11 days.      The cryptocurrency's recent rally despite a stalling of U.S. stocks has rekindled speculation that prices for the two asset classes are starting to diverge after a recent stretch in which they appeared highly correlated.      ""We have discussed the potential for a decoupling from traditional financial markets,"" analysts for the blockchain data firm Glassnode wrote Monday. ""It is too early to tell.""      Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for Diginex, said bitcoin bulls might try to push prices by the end of October above $13,863, the current record for an end of month price. After that, the next price target would be the 2019 high of $13,868.      In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open, even as lawmakers departed Washington to campaign, an apparent death knell for last-ditch efforts to pass an economic stimulus package prior to the Nov. 3 election.    Market moves    The fast-evolving realm of decentralized finance, or DeFi, has attracted large sums of money this year from venture capitalists and traders alike. At last count, some $11 billion of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had been socked into the semi-automated, blockchain-based trading and lending platforms as collateral, a 16-fold increase since the start of the year.      But every month or so, the fledgling industry produces a debacle so suddenly and bizarrely that sane observers have no choice but to step back and remember that the whole exercise is really just a giant game, played with real money. Or a laboratory. Or both.      Such was the case with the latest exploit to hit DeFi: the siphoning off of the equivalent of $24 million in digital tokens from a protocol called Harvest Finance.      As reported by CoinDesk's Will Foxley, an attacker used a complex and sophisticated strategy involving ""flash loans"" and a series of arbitrage trades involving the DeFi protocols Uniswap, Curve and Harvest. Massive amounts of the dollar-linked stablecoins tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC) were swapped back and forth, causing their prices to swing wildly and allowing the attacker to profit from the resulting distortions.      Prices for Harvest's tokens, FARM, tumbled by 65%, and total collateral in the project plunged to $430 million from about $1 billion. The attacker eventually swapped the proceeds into bitcoin.      There wasn't really any hacking involved, just an exploitation of the Harvest system, which is really just a bunch of computer programming. It wasn't illegal, apparently, so a debate ensued on Twitter over the ethics and optics. Harvest officials called it an ""engineering error"" in a blog post on Medium. They pledged to explore ""remediation methods,"" but that's yet to be determined.      Later Monday, Jesse Powell, CEO of the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, unleashed an F-bomb-laced Twitter tirade against ""DeFi scams,"" concluding with the gracious and sagacious dictum that ""taking your losses is the only way to enlightenment,"" as reported by CoinDesk's Sebastian Sinclair.      The lesson is that high profits from DeFi come with the risk not just of bad directional bets but also the chance that some savvier user is playing by different rules. In a market built entirely on a set of codes, what's allowed and what's possible are really one and the same.      One reason innovation occurs so rapidly in DeFi is there's no investor-protection regulator. That's the trade-off: Wallet casualties are written off in the name of development.      – Bradley Keoun      Read more: $24M Attack Triggers $570M ‘Bank Run’ in Latest DeFi Exploit    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin has jumped to 16-month highs despite renewed coronavirus-induced risk aversion in global stock markets.      The top cryptocurrency clocked a high of $13,450 a few minutes before press time, a level last seen in July 2019, surpassing the previous 15-month high of $13,300 reached last week.      The move higher looks impressive, given that European stock markets are trading in the red on coronavirus concerns. The price divergence comes amid new signs of increasing institutional interest in bitcoin, with several public companies disclosing investments in the cryptocurrency over the past few weeks.      The rally looks set to continue as on-chain data shows no signs of investor trepidation due to the risk-off sentiment in stocks. The number of daily on-chain deposits to cryptocurrency exchanges fell to a nine-month low of 26,889 on Monday, and the total number of bitcoins held on exchanges slipped to a fresh two-year low of 2,478,799 BTC, according to data source Glassnode.      Investors typically move coins from their wallets to exchanges to liquidate holdings when expecting a price slide and take direct custody of their coins when the cryptocurrency is expected to rally.      ""The decline in transfers to exchanges despite risk-off in equity markets is a bullish sign,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat while adding that the cryptocurrency is likely to see further strength in the coming weeks.      - Omkar Godbole      Read more: Bitcoin Hits 16-Month High Despite Sell-Off in Global Stocks    What's hot    JPMorgan's wholesale payments token, JPM Coin, to see usage from major tech firm starting next week, exec tells CNBC (CoinDesk)      Singapore bank DBS looks to be planning digital asset exchange, cashed web page shows (CoinDesk)      Huobi exchange allows customers to use credit or debit cards to buy cryptocurrencies without redirect to third-party payments portal (CoinDesk)      U.S. government pursues civil forfeiture claim on more than 300,000 tether after they were reported stolen in hack earlier this year (CoinDesk)      Wyoming governor says state has opportunity to capitalize on crypto and blockchain tech before some other major blue chip company or university does it (CoinDesk)      PayPal's new crypto service could create tax headaches for users, even if they're just buyjng a cup of coffee (CoinDesk)      DeFi protocol Notional lets users lend and borrow cryptocurrencies at fixed rates instead of the more typical variable rates (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    There's a new ""big short"" trade forming on Wall Street – betting against U.S. Treasury bonds (Bloomberg)      Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" jumped to its highest point in almost two months as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming U.S. presidential election slated for Nov. 3 (Reuters)      Volkswagen CEO says auto industry doesn't need another round of stimulus (FT)      Ant Financial IPO subscriptions exceeded allotted shares for institutional investors within first hour (Nikkei Asia)      A few pennies on the dollar is as good as it gets for bondholders of J.C.

Released Tuesday, Grayscale's ""Bitcoin Investor Study"" revealed more than half (55%) of U.S. investors who responded are interested in buying bitcoin (BTC) in 2020.  Compared to the previous year, the results mark a ""significant increase,"" the company said, with a rise of 19 percentage points.  The data also showed the majority of bitcoin investors made allocations within the last 12 months, with 38% investing in the last four months, 26% five to six months prior, and 19% seven to 12 months ago.  The strongest stated driver for bitcoin investments was the coronavirus pandemic, which spurred 63% of respondents into investing, the research showed.  The total number of bitcoin investors in the U.S. also rose to 32 million, up 11 million from the previous year's 21 million.  Almost half of respondents said they believe digital currencies would become mainstream by the end of the decade.  Among other interesting finding, the survey indicated if you'd gone to college or university and got a degree you were more likely to invest; the demographic was split, with twice as many males as females.  Investors were drawn to bitcoin for its low cost to entry and potential as a growth asset, cited as a motivating factor by 59% (up from 51% in 2019).  The study was not without its negative insights, however, finding that, of people aged 55-64, only 40% were familiar with bitcoin and just 30% would consider investing.  Common concerns among survey respondents who were not interested in investing in bitcoin tended to reflect the views of older investors generally, the study showed.  Among the older age bracket, 81% thought bitcoin was too volatile, while 84% said it was too risky for their investment appetite and profile.  Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk's parent firm, Digital Currency Group.

According to a report from CNBC Tuesday, Takis Georgakopoulos, JPMorgan global head of wholesale payments, said a major tech firm will use the token to make global payments starting this week.  As the bank sees blockchain technology becoming commercially viable, it has also created a business unit with around 100 employees, Onyx to house related projects, Georgakopoulos told CNBC.  “We are launching Onyx because we believe we are shifting to a period of commercialization of those technologies, moving from research and development to something that can become a real business,” the executive said in the report.  Christine Moy, blockchain lead at JPM, confirmed the reporting on Twitter:    JPMorgan is focusing on the wholesale payments business, where removing inefficiencies can save the banking industry hundreds of millions of dollars a year, Georgakopoulos added.  First revealed in February 2019, JPM started trials of JPM Coin last summer.  The token was designed to speed transactions, such as payments between firms or bond transactions.

42405306,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLwho,1603798887,Bitcoin Hits 16-Month High Despite Sell-Off in Global Stocks,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price continues to rise even as coronavirus-induced instability rocks the stock markets.    Bitcoin is trading near $13,420 at time of writing, a 2.77% gain on the day.  That marks a fresh 16-month high for the cryptocurrency, which is now up 25% for the month and 87% on a year-to-date basis.  Bitcoin's on-chain data, too, is showing no signs of investor trepidation.  The number of daily deposits to cryptocurrency exchanges fell to a nine-month low of 26,889 on Monday.  Further, the total number of bitcoins held on exchanges slipped to a two-year low of 2,478,799 BTC, according to data source Glassnode.  So the bullish mood continues for bitcoin, even though the global stock markets suffered losses and Wall Street's benchmark equity index, the S&P 500, fell nearly by 2% on coronavirus concerns Monday.  The decline in exchange deposits suggests investors are unperturbed by the risk aversion in traditional markets and see low odds of bitcoin suffering an equity market-induced sell-off.  Investors typically move coins from their wallets to exchanges to liquidate holdings when expecting a price slide, and take direct custody of their assets when the cryptocurrency is expected to rally.  In effect, we appear to be seeing a weakening of the positive correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 seen since the March crash.  ""The decline in transfers to exchanges despite risk-off in equity markets is a bullish sign,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk over WhatsApp.  The cryptocurrency is likely to stay strong in the coming weeks, he added.  Bitcoin's options market is also retaining bullish bias.  The one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, continue to hover below zero, a sign of calls – bullish bets – drawing higher prices (or demand) than puts – bearish bets.  The cryptocurrency suffered a minor drop to $12,700 during Monday's U.S. trading hours only to chart a quick recovery to levels above $13,000.  ""The next resistance to take out is $13,800 (June 2019 high).  ""If bitcoin breaks below $12,700, we will take action and decrease our exposure further,"" Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.

In a tweet on Tuesday, Powell said he would ""not accept"" DeFi projects' attempts at ""externalizing the cost"" of ""hasty reckless"" rollouts.      ""Stop f**king up your bulls**t DeFi scams and expecting exchanges to bail you out,"" Powell said. ""Invest in audits, insurance and please [do your own research].""      The comments come after several DeFi projects suffered some form of an exploit or major management failure, while some have opened to investors with faulty or negligible audits of their code.      At the end of September, gaming protocol Eminence Finance suffered an exploit that saw $15 million worth of DAI drained while still in testing.      The same month, DeFi project SushiSwap suffered a major blow when its pseudonymous creator ""Chef Nomi"" made off with the development fund, prompting a 73% crash in its SUSHI token. Chef Nomi did eventually hand back the $14 million worth of ether (ETH) and apologized to affected investors.

42405303,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLwer,1603785600,Ocean v3 Brings Wave of Data Monetization Tools to Ethereum,"A third and all-encompassing version of Ocean Protocol has been released, fleshing out its vision for “datatokens” and decentralized data marketplaces.      Announced Tuesday, Ocean v3 brings the Ocean data market proposal to life with Ethereum-based datatokens, as well as a range of other features like initial data offerings (IDOs), staking, automated market making (AMM) functionality and the potential to share and monetize machine learning models.      The goal of the project is to democratize the value from data and artificial intelligence (AI), which tends to accumulate in the hands of a few internet giants. In order to monetize data created by individuals, businesses or even cities, you need efficient ways to price individual datasets. To solve this problem, Ocean uses elements of decentralized finance (DeFi), combining AMM price discovery tools with decentralized exchange (DEX) technology.      Read more: Ocean Protocol and Balancer Want to Do for Data What Uniswap Did for Coins      To explain how datatokens work, Ocean founder Trent McConaghy uses the analogy of “wrapping,” the way cryptocurrencies are represented on Ethereum so they can be composed into yield-returning DeFi assets.      “I think a cool way of framing this is that the datatokens are ERC-20 wrappers for access control,” said McConaghy. “So just like you have BTC being brought into the Ethereum ecosystem by wrapping bitcoin, Ocean is wrapping data to bring data services as assets into the Ethereum ecosystem as well.”    Data monetization made real?    McConaghy points to several major obstacles that have held back people’s ability to monetize data: lack of control, lack of privacy, hard to price the data, fake curation signals and poor interoperability.      Leveraging a combination of blockchains and “compute to data” (compute comes to the dataset itself which means data never leaves the premises), Ocean had addressed the first two issues; adding DeFi elements and staking with v3 helps solve the rest, he said.      A data marketplace can be thought of as simply a DEX front end, said McConaghy, one that’s tuned for data, and which makes it really easy to publish data and consume it, as well as trade it, stake it and so on.      Read more: Mercedes Maker Daimler Tests Blockchain for Supply-Chain Data Sharing      Each data service on the market gets its own ERC-20 Ocean datatoken to provide access. To access the dataset, send one datatoken to the data provider. To give access to someone else, send them one datatoken.      Inauthentic signals are a common nuisance on the internet, from fake reviews on Amazon to Twitter bots that follow accounts with little following. Staking in Ocean tackles this problem because, in effect, it’s a kind of curation: The more that’s staked on a particular datatoken pool, the more likely it’s a quality dataset (each pool contains OCEAN tokens and the datatokens corresponding to that dataset).      “When people are buying and selling data there needs to be some baseline credibility around this,” said McConaghy, adding:    “What better way than to have skin in the game. The proxy for the quality of the data is simply the amount of stake in that datatoken pool. Sure, people could still fake things by putting a bunch of OCEAN someplace. But it’s costing them to do so, when they could simply stake on actual valuable datasets that have real volume and get trading fees from that.”    Another interesting side to Ocean’s token model is how staking operates in the context of AMMs. “Staking is adding liquidity; adding liquidity is staking,” said McConaghy. “Rather than those tokens kind of being locked up and not being able to use them, they add value to that pool.”      Assembling these component parts (DeFi uses the term “composability” for the Lego-brick way things can be clicked together on Ethereum) gives people a fighting chance to monetize their data in this new “shadow industry,” currently dominated by firms like Facebook and Google, said McConaghy.      AMMs offer an easy way to launch so-called initial data offerings, or IDOs, to create a market in some dataset or other. These datatokens can then find their way onto order-book DEXs like 0x, Binance DEX and Kyber, McConaghy said, while centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase could readily create their own datatoken-based marketplaces and also think about selling datasets that they’ve generated internally.    Ocean collaborations    With its v3 launch, Ocean announced partnerships with CivicTechHub, the largest database of projects dedicated to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as Swash, Human Protocol, Thalus.ai and Transport Genie.      “To incentivize better data flowing into our COVID-projects database, and to facilitate cross-collaboration, the ability of the Ocean Protocol Market’s liquidity to double as a curation and investment mechanism is a logical step,” Vincent Verheyen, CEO and founder of CivicTechHub, said in a statement.      Read more: Data Ownership Should Be About Software, Not Lawsuits      CivicTechHub aims to provide Ocean functionality to each of the projects on its COVID-19 platform individually, said Verheyen, adding:    “The possibility to share either full data access or compute only means the crisis projects and solution teams will have the choice to provide access to their data according to their preference.”    Ocean was primed from the get-go to complement AI platforms or web apps like Azure ML Studio or Anaconda Cloud, and AI-oriented data marketplaces can easily be deployed within Ocean’s Python library.      “I’m very excited about data scientists going nuts with this,” McConaghy said, “It lets you deploy data marketplaces in 10 lines of code.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/27/ocean-v3-brings-wave-of-data-monetization-tools-to-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7c0392fe321a6e5788adf80f9814bca2cd6d711-1500x923.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
