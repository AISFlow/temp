However, recent analyses have pointed to Uwerx, a new crypto that has defied market odds with its presale and bullish token surpassing expectations. The WERX token has witnessed over a 100% surge due to its utility, with analysts predicting that WERX, which started at $0.005, could reach $1 by Q1 of 2024. This article will give deeper insights into what makes Uwerx unique, its presale, and the 2024 price predictions for Chiliz (CHZ). >>BUY WERX TOKENS NOW Chiliz (CHZ) 2024 Predictions As It Gains Bullish Sentiments Chiliz (CHZ) was recently listed as a security by the SEC. This action which took a huge toll on many cryptos seems to have not had much effect on Chiliz (CHZ), as evidenced in its token’s recent performance. Chiliz (CHZ) has continued trending, recording above 17% increase in the past week. This is quite surprising as the token has been in the red for over two months before the SEC’s action. Hence, the recent traction is bewildering. Chiliz (CHZ) continues to display strong potential, meaning it will likely gain a price increase. The CHZ token sells at $0.07591, but 2024 predictions show it could reach $0.15. The recent bullish sentiments Chiliz (CHZ) has witnessed show the token might not be entirely market dependent but is affected by the value it provides and the moves it makes. Chiliz (CHZ) Launches The Sports Blockchain, Gets Listed In The Asian Markets Chiliz (CHZ) is a Layer-1 protocol revolutionizing the entertainment and sports industry and bringing them to Web3. Chiliz’s (CHZ) recent launch of the Sports Blockchain is a testament to this vision and its continued efforts to actively connect fans with their favorite teams and players. This separates it from the tons of cryptos in the market, putting it in the spotlight since its 2016 launch. The Sports blockchain provides the infrastructure and facilities needed for sports. Chiliz(CHZ) has begun migrating Fan Tokens to the blockchain, and so far, it has moved that of PRSJ, RIVER, TIGERS, SHARKS, HASHTAG, and BENFICA. Chiliz (CHZ), which faces delisting in the US, has been listed among the over 400 tradeable assets in the Indonesian market. This announcement has further boosted the CHZ token, signifying a future surge in trading activities. >>BUY WERX TOKENS NOW Uwerx’s (WERX) Presale Exceeds Initial Forecasts The speed at which Uwerx’s presale progressed is still shocking, as it started just a few months back and is now in its final round, stage 5. The increased demand for WERX has led to increasing the presale WERX quantity to 427.5 million. 72.5 million WERX is available in stage 5, and WERX total supply is 750 million. The WERX price has tremendously increased, as it is now at $0.047725, a huge surge from the starting price of $0.005. The same goes for its launch price, as WERX is set to launch at $0.095 - $0.115. There is an ongoing 15% purchase bonus to further benefit users at the current presale stage. Uwerx (WERX) Has Competitive Advantage Over Centralized Freelancing Platforms A recent report shows that 71% of companies hire freelancers to increase business agility, especially during economic uncertainty. These companies will usually go to freelancing platforms that provide better working conditions and services at a subsidized rate, which is why Uwerx will gain massive adoption. Uwerx will be the first decentralized freelancing platform as it integrates blockchain technology. It will charge only a 1% service fee against the 10 or 20% charged by centralized platforms. Another innovative feature of this project is the Uwerx Vault, which is similar to the concept of staking. The Vault acts as a storage for users to store their tokens while simultaneously providing rewards. Uwerx’s Alpha version has been launched and now has features such as Freelancer Profile Creation, Hiring Dashboard Page, Forgot Password, Sign-Up and Logging Pages, Initial Step of Job Creation, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process Page, My Activity Page, Settings, Initial Step of Finding Talent, Milestone, and Application Boosting using the WERX token. The Job Creation Page was revamped to the Post Job and Apply Page to make it easier for freelancers to apply for jobs. Features like Freelancer and Client Dashboards and Tools will soon be released. The platform has gained over 1,825 Telegram members, 1,652 Twitter followers, and 6,953 sign-ups. SolidProof and InterFi Network have conducted audits on Uwerx and approved its security. Uwerx will soon be transitioning to its Beta version, which is now in the works. This will allow users to test the platform. Many developments have been made, and users will be updated soon. The project’s success also follows the agile methodology the developers use to release the project in bits while making improvements following users’ feedback. The team is user-based, welcoming users’ feedback and putting them into action. This feedback can be sent to their email, feedback@uwerx.network. Following a modification of the WERX allocations, the team re-assigned only 7% of the total WERX allocation to themselves (previously 8%) and locked their token share, which will last for nine months. This action was hastened by the 82.8% of the community who voted for them to start before the presale ended, and it began on June 7. The presale ends on July 31. The team will give up the ownership of the smart contract immediately after Uwerx launches on centralized exchanges. Also, a Test Airdrop will be conducted to validate receiving wallet addresses for users after 98.2% of the token holders voted for this. Uwerx has all it takes to become a dominating force in the freelancing industry with its fundamental advantages over traditional freelancing platforms. Indeed, it is poised for massive adoption. Its presale is the best opportunity to enter this blue-chip future at an extremely good price. Solook no further! Purchase the WERX token now for a 15% purchase bonus.

Ethereum has had the most substantial price growth in 2023 with its prices rising by over 60%. Bitcoin lagged behind Ethereum, despite having the larger market capitalization, with its prices only growing by about 40% at the height of its bull run. Cryptocurrency markets have been generally bearish since the two most popular tokens’ price growth earlier in the year, but that hasn’t stopped InQubeta’s presale from exceeding all expectations. Tokens allocated for the presale’s beta stage were sold out before the period ended. Investors standing to increase the value of their investments by 400% thanks to incremental price changes at each of the presale's ten stages is one of the best deals in the cryptocurrency world. InQubeta (QUBE) making waves with Reddit investors Reddit investors know a thing about bull runs so it’s prudent to consider which cryptocurrencies or other investment opportunities are popular on the forum. Redditors wreaked havoc on Wall Street whales a few years ago when the forum backed stocks like GameStop and AMC, squeezing hedge funds that were shorting them. The Reddit mania led to $24 billion being traded on U.S. stock exchanges on Jan 27, 2021, exceeding the previous high of $8 billion set during the 2008 financial crisis. GameStop stock prices went skyrocketing, forcing investors shorting the stock to purchase some to minimize their losses, driving prices further up. InQubeta is the latest cryptocurrency project to gain the attention of Redditors as its platform makes investments in artificial intelligence more accessible for everyday people. It’s not surprising to see Reddit investors, many of whom view themselves as the little people sticking it to the big whales, embrace a democratic platform that empowers everyday people who might not meet the elitist standards of traditional investment channels, like minimum investments that surpass the average annual income in the U.S. The InQubeta way InQubeta makes becoming part-owner of an artificial intelligence startup as easy as buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the ecosystem’s marketplace. Startups looking for capital make these equity-based NFTs on InQubeta’s Ethereum-based blockchain and investors purchase them with $QUBE tokens. The NFTs are sent to investors after sales are finalized and they’re free to sell or hold on to them at any point. These NFTs work like stocks, and some come with extra rewards like a slice of the startup’s profits. Thanks to InQubeta, investing in what many are already calling the biggest tech revolution in human history is now more accessible than ever. The internet was the last significant tech breakthrough and it created many millionaires and billionaires. For instance, $2,000 invested in Netflix in the early 2000s would be worth over a million dollars today. InQubeta’s approach to investing now makes similar investment opportunities available to all. Bitcoin (BTC) is almost halfway back to pre-2022 prices Bitcoin continues to enjoy the largest market capitalization in the cryptocurrency space and it’s already enjoyed some decent growth in 2023. Many cryptocurrency experts are expecting a bigger bull run later in the year. Ethereum (ETH) growing faster than Bitcoin Ethereum has seen more price increases in 2023 than Bitcoin due to various reasons like Ethereum-based altcoins like InQubeta and Polygon (MATIC) making waves in mainstream and crypto investment circles. Ethereum will likely continue outpacing Bitcoin for the remainder of the year but don’t expect it to keep up with InQubeta. Summary InQubeta has an excellent chance of seeing more growth than more popular coins like BTC and ETH thanks to incremental price changes during its presale and its tokens being undervalued. Investors can expect to increase the value of their portfolios by up to 400% during the presale period, and there are no limits for InQubeta prices from that point.

Tradecuve is the only trading platform on the market that combines the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges under one roof, well-positioning itself to challenge the likes of Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken and earn a spot among the top-three global trading platforms. Additionally, TCRV will provide its token holders with many exclusive benefits, including discounts on trading fees, high leverage at 500:1, algorithmic AI trading, and copy-trading (where users can pay a subscription fee to traders with good success rates to copy their traders).

Tradecurve is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, where investors can buy tokens at $0.018 and receive a 50% deposit bonus.

The order comes amidst a growing crackdown on crypto and will require the exchange to provide significant user data to the authorities. The IRS Headache As a result of the ruling, Kraken will have to hand over swathes of user information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Internal Revenue Service had filed a court petition in the Northern District of California moments after Kraken had announced that it would settle charges brought against it by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC had charged Kraken with offering unregistered securities through its staking as a service program. The IRS had previously issued a summons to Kraken in 2021, but the exchange failed to comply. The IRS had stated in its February petition, “Despite discussions between the parties, Payward Ventures Inc. [one of the registered companies that make up Kraken] & Subsidiaries has failed to comply with the summons and has not produced the books, records, papers, and other data demanded in the summons. Payward Ventures Inc. & Subsidiaries’ failure to comply with the summons continues to this date.” The IRS has stated that it is seeking information on Kraken accounts that have carried out at least $20,000 worth of cryptocurrency trading in a single year between 2016 and 2020. On its part, Kraken has called the tax agency’s summons an “unjustified treasure hunt.” It also argued that the summons went well beyond the boundaries set in a similar fight with Coinbase around six years ago. The Court Order The federal court ruling comes as regulatory authorities in the United States of America increase their crackdown on the crypto markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission has already filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, alleging that the former mishandled customer funds, misled investors, and broke securities laws, while the latter was running an illegal exchange. The order passed on Friday orders Kraken to turn over account details and user information such as taxpayer identification number, birth date, user name or pseudonym, phone number, email address, address, and several other documents. Furthermore, the exchange will also be required to turn over transaction hashes and blockchain addresses that are already a part of the transaction data that it can share. The judge wrote that the IRS has a legitimate purpose and reasoning for seeking the materials in question, adding that it must determine the tax liability for exchange users within the stipulated time period. The IRS’s demands are backed by the fact that taxpayers filing returns for Bitcoin-related investments are minuscule compared to the sheer volume of trading activity on Kraken. The order stated that Kraken had over 4 million clients in the time period between 2011 to 2017, conducting over $140 billion worth of trades. Additionally, it stated that the exchange was registering 50,000 new users daily. Several IRS Requests Rejected However, not everything went the way the IRS wanted. In fact, the judge outright refused several requests put forward by the IRS. The judge also rejected the tax agency’s requests for receiving employment information and source of wealth from the exchange. The judge wrote in his analysis of some of the requests, “The Court must determine whether the Government’s summons is narrowly tailored, that is, whether it is ‘no broader than necessary to achieve its purpose.

The tweet was timely, aligning with Bitcoin’s ascent above $31,450, marking its highest value since June 2022. This surge was primarily attributed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s endorsement of the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF, referred to as BITX, thereby establishing it as the inaugural leveraged bitcoin futures ETF in the United States. Furthermore, the positive sentiment expressed by BlackRock contributed to the overall strength of the cryptocurrency market. Controversies Surrounding Binance And Its CEO Bitcoin has witnessed a progressive expansion in its practicality as an increasing number of merchants and service providers have embraced it as a viable payment option. The realm of Bitcoin has seen a surge in the availability of futures and options, lending platforms, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Amidst these positive advancements, a series of allegations have surfaced regarding Binance and its CEO, concerning the alleged employment of a “liquidation waterfall” strategy in the sale of spot Bitcoin. Zhao has refuted these claims. Related Reading: The CEO of Binance Accuses the SEC – Where to Diversify Your Portfolio?

They recently shared their progress on Twitter, acknowledging that observant users had spotted their new lightning nodes.

These improvements contribute to enhanced overall efficiency and convenience. The surge in Bitcoin’s value and utility has led to a significant milestone.

While Bitcoin’s volatility continues to capture attention, another significant event looms on the horizon – the forthcoming Bitcoin halving.

14384179,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540671,1688205405,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Up 55% Following BlackRock’s ETF Application, EDX Markets Launch","Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has experienced a remarkable upswing, with its value soaring by 55% in the past week. This surge can be attributed to two key factors: BlackRock’s recent application for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the launch of EDX Markets. BlackRock’s move to seek SEC approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF has sparked a wave of similar applications, generating a bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. This sentiment has had a particularly positive impact on Bitcoin and related projects, including Bitcoin Cash. Nonetheless, the introduction of EDX Markets, a platform catering to institutional investors, appears to be the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin Cash’s recent price surge. EDX Markets, backed by industry giants Fidelity, Schwab, and Citadel Securities, carries significant weight despite not being registered with the SEC. Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX Markets, expressed confidence in the compliance of the four listed crypto tokens (Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin) with the SEC. The platform’s selective listing of cryptocurrencies, which includes Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, has been interpreted as a vote of confidence, specifically in Bitcoin Cash. The listing of BCH on the EDX Markets exchange is an indication of the token’s regulatory clearance. This interpretation gains significance as the SEC scrutinizes other blockchain projects. Related reading: Here’s What Caused Bitcoin’s Flash Crash To $29,000 Bitcoin Cash Uptrend Fueled By Volume Spike On Upbit A major factor that could have influenced the recent uptrend in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the short squeeze and an unexpected surge in trading volume on the South Korean exchange, Upbit. A short squeeze occurs when the price of an asset rises, leading traders who had bet against the asset’s price to cover their positions at a loss or face forced liquidation. The volatility in BCH’s price resulted in approximately $19 million in liquidations within the past 24 hours, with short orders accounting for 77% of the total amount. These liquidation levels represent the highest recorded in June 2023, according to data from Coinglass. BCH’s price remained heavily suppressed throughout the year, fluctuating between $100 and $150. However, its value experienced a significant vertical rise after being listed on EDX Markets. Currently, BCH is trading at $308.72, reaching levels last seen 14 months ago in May 2022. According to crypto research outlet The Tie, BCH trading volumes on Binance have reached levels not witnessed in two years. This indicates a resurgence of BCH’s trading interest following its EDX Markets listing. This renewed interest highlights a positive shift in the trading dynamics surrounding Bitcoin Cash. BCH is trading at $280.7 at press time, with a 5% decline in the past 24 hours. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

The community has been eagerly awaiting this update, hoping it will address various scalability issues and bring further improvements to the network. Despite the excitement surrounding Polygon’s future plans, the token, MATIC, seems to be experiencing a period of struggle. As the crypto space evolves rapidly, investors and enthusiasts wonder what could be causing MATIC’s current downturn and how it may impact the platform’s trajectory. Could Polygon 2.0 be the key to revitalizing MATIC’s value and restoring confidence in the project? Related Reading: Arbitrum Gains Tempered By Obstacles, Hindering ARB’s Further Upswing A Shift For Polygon’s Scalability And Liquidity? Polygon (MATIC) recently took to Twitter to provide a sneak peek into the highly anticipated Polygon 2.0 update, which aims to revolutionize the network by offering limitless scalability and unified liquidity. According to the tweet, Polygon aspires to transform itself into the value layer of the Internet, emphasizing the significant role it envisions for its upgraded infrastructure. 1/ Today, we are excited to propose the Polygon 2.0 architecture, designed to provide unlimited scalability and unified liquidity, thus transforming Polygon into the Value Layer of the Internet! Read the blog 👇🏽 or keep scrolling 🧵https://t.co/sShy6R1E6R pic.twitter.com/BTdwkri4nI — Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) June 29, 2023 The architecture of Polygon 2.0 comprises four distinct protocol layers, each serving a crucial purpose within the network, contributing to the overall functionality and efficiency of the platform. Notably, Polygon’s staking space has witnessed growth within the span of just seven days. MATIC market cap currently at $10 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Staking Rewards data reveals a noticeable increase in the number of MATIC stakers during this period, reflecting the growing interest and participation in the Polygon ecosystem. Despite the positive developments in Polygon’s staking community, the MATIC token has encountered a minor setback in its market value. CoinGecko reports the current price of MATIC at $0.659, indicating a slight 0.2% decline in the past 24 hours and a 2.6% loss in value over the past seven days. Source: Coingecko Mixed Signals In MATIC Price Report The latest MATIC price report presents a somewhat intriguing scenario, with certain metrics displaying bullish signals while others suggest a contrasting outlook. Among the positive indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signaled a bullish edge in the market, instilling optimism among investors. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed an uptick, indicating increased buying pressure and potential strength in MATIC’s price movement. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Takes Investors By Surprise With 23% Rally However, the report also highlighted a concerning aspect of MATIC’s price trend. The gap between the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 55-day EMA was widening, raising red flags among traders and market observers. A significant and increasing gap between these two EMAs could suggest a potential loss of short-term momentum and might indicate a more prolonged downtrend for the token’s price.
