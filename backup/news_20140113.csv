42425251,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvnzh,1389632403,Circle Sponsors CoinScrum's Bitcoin Networking Event in London,"Circle is sponsoring a networking event designed with bitcoin businesses in mind. CoinScrum, formerly Bitcoin Focus, is holding the event in London with hopes to educate and connect bitcoin entrepreneurs from across the UK and beyond.  The CoinScrum Bitcoin Business Networking event will be held at Club Workspace at the Clerkenwell Workshops, 27-31 Clerkenwell Close, London, EC1R 0AT – kicking off at 6:30 pm on 21st January.  The event will feature presentations by bitcoin developer Mike Hearn, Circle Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Allaire and Circle Chief Technical Officer Sean Neville. Hearn has been a key contributor to the main Bitcoin reference client for years, and the organizers are promising a fascinating presentation from this industry veteran.  Hearn is the Bitcoin Foundation’s Law and Policy Committee's chair, a position that has thrust him into the limelight in the past. One of Hearn’s ideas involves “marking” or “redlisting” bitcoins as a way of tracking illegal transactions or stolen bitcoins. The proposal is still seen as very controversial, and it has quite a few vocal proponents and equally vocal critics.  Neville and Allaire each will make short presentations at the networking event. Bitcoin startups are encouraged to take to the stage and pitch ideas or to look for partners and investors.  The event is geared towards people exploring business opportunities in the bitcoin economy, and it will provide a platform for those who wish to discuss ideas and connect with investors, or partners. The presentations are not planned to be too long, as the emphasis will be on the open-mic session.  For people who are new to bitcoin, TechHub is planning its next bitcoin bootcamp in February.  You can register to attend at meetup.com.

42425264,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoPh,1389628830,eToro Launches Bitcoin Trading For 3 Million Users,"Asset-trading platform eToro today launched bitcoin trading for its three million registered users.  With the launch, the platform hopes to target investors who are new to the cryptocurrency. Communications manager Nadav Avidan said:  ""If you want to invest in bitcoin and you're not a computer geek, you don't really know where to start. We're providing a simple way for people to get involved.""  According to Navidan, almost 5% of eToro's active user base (about 200,000 users) have open bitcoin positions at the moment. Users from South America, the UK and Germany are currently the top bitcoin traders.  EToro's bitcoin prices are in line with those quoted on Mt. Gox. The platform charges 1% of the transaction value on top of each transaction.  Three-click process  Etoro has classified bitcoin as a stock on its platform, partly because it wanted to familiarise users with the cryptocurrency. Users select the BTC 'stock' on eToro's platform, the amount of capital they wish to invest, and click to confirm their choice.  Navidan said this three-click process is ""probably the simplest way"" to invest in bitcoin at the moment.    Orders for bitcoin on the site will be executed four times a day, which is more frequent than the daily order execution for equities on the platform. The higher frequency is required to account for bitcoin's more volatile price movements, Avidan said.      Bitcoin investors on eToro will not require a wallet for the digital currency. The platform trades bitcoin on a 'contract for difference' basis, which means users buy and sell financial derivatives that track the BTC price without actually owning the underlying asset.    Etoro's chief executive and founder Yoni Assia is an outspoken bitcoin supporter, with some 2.6% of his eToro portfolio currently in bitcoin. He is also working on an open standards protocol to exchange value over the internet with coloured coins.  The idea behind the coloured coins framework is to allow users to hold various assets, in addition to bitcoin, by marking individual coins as unique units. These 'marked' bitcoins can then theoretically carry a value independent of the prevailing bitcoin price if they are backed by a contract or agreement.  Coloured coins can, therefore, be used to store and exchange assets other than bitcoin, including currencies, equities or bonds – while taking advantage of the block chain to verify transactions.  About eToro  eToro bills itself as a 'social investment network' that combines trading currencies, commodities, indices and equities with social networking features. It has more than 3 million users in 200 countries, with about 200,000 active users, according to Avidan.  One of the features eToro touts is Copy Trader, which allows users to replicate other users' trades. The concept is similar to mirror trading, a well-established trader strategy.  User profiles include metrics like the ratio of ""winning trades"", or the ratio of positions that were closed with a gain, the percentage of profitable weeks and the average number of days a user chose to leave a position open.  An eToro user can analyse these statistics and choose to copy users who they deem to be successful. The platform claims that Copy Trader users have a ""win ratio"" of 80%, TechCrunch has reported.  The most copied trader on eToro at the moment, within a six-month period, is AnasSleiman, with 8,375 users replicating his trades. Recent months have not been kind to the popular trader, however, as his portfolio is down nearly 30%. AnasSleiman, whose profile says he is based in Ireland, holds about two-thirds of his portfolio in currencies and the rest in commodities and indices.  A cursory search revealed a number of websites and forum posts calling eToro a ""scam"". The company even has a page dedicated to debunking these accusations. Avidan dismissed the accusations, saying that users wrongly blamed the platform when they lost money on trades. Avidan added that eToro is regulated by the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, an independent regulatory body with the power to investigate or ban financial products it deems are marketed in a misleading way.

42425256,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvo5h,1389621655,"Skyhook's Open-Source Bitcoin ATM Will Cost Under $1,000","There are a surprising number of bitcoin ATMs currently on the market for entrepreneurs willing to make an investment.  Companies like Robocoin and Lamassu are building and selling ATMs that can exchange government-backed currencies for bitcoin all over the world.  While hardware and software are readily available, the potential roadblock for many of these ATMs is compliance. In many countries the regulation of virtual money transmitters is still something of a grey area.  Additionally, some governments do not appear to be interested in hosting virtual currency ATMs at all. CoinDesk recently reported that Robocoin was shipping its machines over to Hong Kong and Taiwan at the very beginning of this year, however Taiwan decided to block the ATMs soon after.  Building an ATM  Jon Hannis, founder of Skyhook, told CoinDesk that it would only take one large operator to establish itself in the market for the bitcoin ATM floodgates to open.  His effort, the Skyhook ATM, is currently in development and expected to be available soon. The idea behind the machine was to build a low-cost ATM using open-source hardware and software.  Hannis' Skyhook project can be seen in the video below:  The goal for Skyhook, according to Hannis, is not to make money from the sales of the ATM units. The concept is more community driven, the idea being that if bitcoin ATMs are widely available for people to use, bitcoin adoption will proliferate.  ""I was looking at the technology, and was considering getting one of the Lamassu ATMs. I looked into the hardware required for that, and the more I looked into it the more I realized it was very difficult.""  ""I kind of gave up for a little while there, but I eventually came across Python drivers that would work on Linux for a specific type of bill acceptor. And so I ordered a few of those to test with. And then I figured, wow, I can get the parts and everything, even a steel case powdercoated, for below $1,000,"" he said.  Open Source  The ATM's retail price will be $999, and Skyhook will be accepting bitcoin as payment. The idea is to open-source the ATMs once they are ready, which is what Hannis and a small group of developers are working to complete.  ""Right now we have a few developers helping us. We shipped out a few units to them. They are basically part of the team now, and they are able to use the device and get all the updates. But that’s what I want to make, an open-source project.""  Everything, including the hardware, can be modified, according to Hannis. ""Even as far as opening up the hardware and all the other requirements so people can make their own mistakes, if they want to do that,"" Hannis said.  ""The reason I haven’t opened it yet is because I want to get production to a point where I’m able to keep up with whatever demand will be there once we decide to start advertising. We have a long list of people [interested]. But just those interested in helping development are getting access to the units right now.""  Keeping prices low  While a Lamassu unit will set you back $5,000, and a Robocoin model nearer the $20,000 mark, the Skyhook ATM team have used low-cost hardware to keep the unit's price down.  ""The brains of it is actually Raspberry Pi. So it’s a lightweight ARM distribution of Linux. It’s a Nexus 7 tethered to a Raspberry Pi,"" explained Hannis.  Although price was a key factor for Harris, security was something his team also kept in mind. The unit itself is made of steel and will have mounting capabilities to prevent a smash-and-grab theft. The development team have also put in place software security measures:  ""It’s making API calls through a protected SSL connection. There's the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, so it would probably be better to have a hardwired Ethernet in, which we’ll have on the unit.""  ""If the power gets cut, it has a RAM disk with the session data. And you have to enter the password when you first power on the unit.""  Hannis' site for the project, btcpdx.com, is still under construction. But he hopes to go live when the ATM units are available for pre-order. Skyhook itself is currently in a limited beta, open only to developers. However, interested parties are encouraged to email: skyhook@btcpdx.com  ""We haven't taken any pre-order money for these devices. Once we're at a point that we can ship out within 5 business days, we'll be officially accepting orders,"" Hannis said.

42425253,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvo3h,1389616251,GoldMoney Group Adds Bitcoin to Its Precious Metal Vaults,"GoldMoney Group, one of Britain’s largest precious metal storage firms, has added bitcoin to the list of commodities it is willing to store in its vaults.  Established in 2001, the firm currently stores precious metals worth in excess of $1.4bn in secure vaults across five countries.  Today sees GoldMoney launch Netagio – a spin-off business that offers a cold storage solution for bitcoins. Cold storage is a form of offline storage where bitcoins are encrypted on storage devices and placed in secure vaults.  Pros and cons  Security  is the most obvious benefit of cold storing bitcoins with Netagio, as your bitcoins will be safely tucked away behind a few layers of encryption and physical security.  This might not be the best solution for speculators and those who require access to their bitcoins on short notice. However, Netagio will also allow users to freely access a few bitcoins if they happen to need them.  Even this service places an emphasis on security. It features two-factor authentication and users can set it up in such a way that their accounts can only be accessed from user-defined locations.  The service is free and you can check out the Netagio website for additional details. Simon Hamblin, managing director at Netagio, said:  “We are the only bitcoin wallet service in Europe to offer this type of free offline storage service, involving military-grade hardware, levels of encryption to give our customers comfort and security, all [...] backed by a reputable company who you can trust.”  He added: “Being a part of a larger established group that has a heritage in the dealing and safe-keeping of precious metal since 2001 makes it one of the most compelling storage offerings in Europe.”  Hamblin thinks cryptocurrencies have a future, but pointed out that they remain risky at this point. In any case, GoldMoney wants to let people to buy, store and sell digital currencies, regardless of whether they succeed in the long run. As Hamblin puts it: “Bitcoin might be the one, it might not be the one.”  UK competitors  Netagio isn't the first cold storage service to hit the market, nor is it the first of its kind in the UK. Elliptic Vault made headlines when it launched last week, underwritten by Lloyds of London.  Elliptic is planning to create a full suite of digital currency services that should make them more secure and easier to use.  At this point, however, both companies are offering what can only be described as niche service for people who cashed in on bitcoin and don’t plan on cashing out anytime soon.

42425265,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvoNh,1389607221,Bitcoin Takes Off at the UK's Top Flying School,"The UK’s number one flying school is now letting wannabe pilots pay in bitcoin.  The North London Flying School in, you guessed it, North London took the step in November and is using Coinbase to process bitcoin payments.  From leisurely flights in a two-seater Piper Cherokee to full-on acrobatic experiences in a Extra 300L, the school offers a range of options for bitcoiners wanting to get up into the air.  Like many bitcoin-accepting businesses, the school began taking the currency after one crypto-curious employee took the initiative.  General Manager Gavriel Merkado explained: “I had been keeping track of the rising popularity of bitcoin and proposed to the company director the idea of accepting payments in bitcoin.”  Bitcoin transactions  Only a handful of the products on their website can currently be purchased with bitcoin, but they can do payments in person for any of their products – if Merkado is there that is:  ""If an aircraft landed and the pilot bought some fuel, it is simple to pay with a credit card and anyone can handle the transaction. If they want to pay with bitcoin then I need to be around, as the others haven't been shown what to do.""  Which would seem to be in keeping with Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam’s recent comment that “99.9% of merchants do not currently accept bitcoin or have a good understanding of what it is.”  So far the school hasn’t had any customers pay in bitcoin, but Merkado says he’s optimistic about the broader question of bitcoin’s acceptance as a currency:  “In order for a 'thing' to be a currency it has to have certain prerequisites, it has to be limited, it has to be hard to fake, it has to be easy to store, it has to be easy to transfer and it has to be generally accepted. In my view, bitcoin beats all other traditional currencies in the first four categories.""  The North London Flying School isn’t the only place you can use your bitcoins to get up into the air. Just 20 kilometres outside of Bratislava, Slovakia, the PilotClub, a family-run business, began accepting bitcoin at the end of 2013. They take customers up in a ""small sports airplane"", which PilotClub's Norbert Chromek says makes all the difference:  ""We definitely recommend you to try this type of adrenalin because, believe us, it’s a huge difference between flying with an airline and small sport airplanes.""
