According to court documents filed today, the SEC accused Renwick Haddow of misleading stakeholders who bought into two companies he founded: Bitcoin Shop Inc., which was advertised as a platform for trading bitcoin, and Bar Works, a co-working space company akin to WeWork. Concurrently, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is also pressing charges against Haddow.  The SEC alleged that Haddow, who resides in New York, misrepresented key factors about the company's operation and the background of senior executives of Bitcoin Store Inc. who, according to the statement, ""do not appear to exist"" in an attempt to to allure potential investors.  Haddow – who the SEC said created a broker-dealer firm, called InCrowd Equity, without registering with the agency – was further accused of diverting funds raised from investors to bank accounts held outside of the country.  The SEC said today in a release:  ""Haddow allegedly diverted more than 80 percent of the in funds raised by the broker-dealer for the Bitcoin Store, and sent more than $4 million from the Bar Works bank accounts to one or more accounts in Mauritius and $1 million to one or more accounts in Morocco.""  In court documents, the SEC noted that Haddow had previously received an eight-year disqualification in the UK from working as the director of a company, a ban stemming from his involvement with a firm called Branded Leisure plc.  The SEC also alleged that fake identities were employed by the accused firms. The court documents noted that the CEO of the startup is named Gordon Phillips, who appeared in promotional videos for the service. According to a LinkedIn page, the profiled person used to work for HSBC in London and Hong Kong, as well as Deutsche Bank.  Yet the agency alleged that Gordon Phillips ""never worked for HSBC or Deutsche Bank"" and it believes the name is a fictitious one.  Earlier this month, New York business publication Crain's reported on the collapse of Bar Works, noting that the firm is the subject of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as two investor-led lawsuits. A report in January, from The Real Deal, first suggested that fake identities were employed.  The website www.bitcoinstore.global appears to be connected to the scheme. A press release published on the site in July 2015 showed that Bitcoin Store Inc., the exact name of the entity charged by the SEC, was trying to issue a convertible promissory notes with a coupon of 8% per annum in order to raise $1.825 million.

Dubbed the Blockchain Bundesverband, the startups involved include Jolocom, Slock.it, IOTA and others based in Germany. The aim, the group said earlier this monthhttp://bundesblock.de/2017/06/20/hello-world/, is to present ""a uniform voice"" and advocate for an open environment for the development of blockchain applications, particularly in the public sector.  One notable aspect of the Blockchain Bundesverband is its political advisory panel, which includes representatives from the country's major political parties. Members include Thomas Jarzombek of the CDU and Jens Zimmermann of the SPD, Germany's two leading parties. Representatives from Die Linke, Die Grünen and FDP are also part of the group.  The Blockchain Bundesverband is positioning itself ahead of federal elections, set to be held across Germany in late September.  The organization is eyeing the next government to take power as a potential partner. Once a new coalition forms in the Reichstag (Germany's legislature), the advocacy group will push for the ""establishment of innovation-friendly legal certainty in the field of civil law, taxation and regulation"", according to a new blog posthttp://bundesblock.de/2017/06/29/offizielle-gruendung-des-blockchain-bundesverbands/.  The group is also calling for specific applications in the areas of record keeping and data management, as well as its use in ""identity services and electronic signatures"".  In statements, the startups involved argued that Germany should take a leading role in advancing the utilization of the tech.  ""The potential of blockchain technology can only develop when citizens, as well as private and public institutions, connect with the technology and the technology itself is recognized by law and society,"" the group wrote.

42379546,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88d4J,1498840249,Bitcoin Exchanges Launch Insurance Products in Japan,"Two bitcoin exchanges in Japan are launching insurance products aimed at preventing losses tied to failed transactions.  According to a report from Nikkei, bitFlyer is working with Mitsui Suitomo Insurance, a subsidiary of MS&AD Insurance Holdings Group, which offers non-life insurance products. That product is said to be going live today.  Coincheck, another domestic bitcoin exchange, is pursuing a similar product release in conjunction with Tokio Marine and Nichido Fire Insurance.  While the exact policy details aren't immediately available, the products are said to be aimed at shoring up confidence in digital currency transactions. In the case of bitFlyer, the policy would cover losses for retailers that accept bitcoin in the event that a customer transaction doesn't go through due to technical problems.  ""The hope is that more stores will adopt bitcoin as a payment method if they are not forced to simply eat such losses,"" the publication wrote.  The move comes months after Japan's government recognized bitcoin as a kind of legal payment method, a policy shift that also formed an oversight framework for digital currency exchanges in the country.

42379556,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88dI9,1498835749,Japan to Test Blockchain for Government Contract System,"Japan is reportedly looking to integrate blockchain into its online systems for accepting government contract bids.  According to Nikkei Asian Review, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, who oversees the Japanese administrative system and manages local governments, will test a blockchain-based system for processing government tenders in the fiscal year starting from this April through March 2018.  In the tendering process, governments solicit bids for contracts from vendors, collecting a swath of information from those companies as they assess whom they'll award projects. Japanese officials want to see if blockchain can help improve the efficiency of existing processes by using the tech to connect the government offices that possess the required information. In this case, blockchain would form part of that back-end system for sharing data between agencies, if implemented.  Japans's government procurement market amounts to more than $600bn annually – an amount worth 16.2% of the country's GDP, and 38.3% of its total public-sector expenditures – according to research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The focus on procurement forms part of a broader strategy to incorporate the tech in e-governemnt systems, according to Nikkei. Future plans are said to include sharing some of the findings of the trial with private-sector partners.  Japan isn't alone in testing this use case area. As CoinDesk reported earlier this month, the US General Services Administration is seeking prototype proposals in a bid to see how blockchain could improve its contract review process for IT vendors.

42379545,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88d33,1498831214,Illinois Lawmakers Pass Bill Forming Blockchain Task Force,"Lawmakers in the US state of Illinois have passed a bill creating an inter-governmental task force that will study public sector applications of blockchain.  The measure – House Resolution 120 – passed with 98 votes on 28th June, receiving just seven non-votes and two abstentions.  As reported in February, the bill called for participation from agencies such as the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR), the Cook County Recorder of Deeds and the Department of Innovation and Technology. Other members will be appointed by Illinois' Secretary of State, as well as leaders from both the state's House and Senate.  Among the specific applications set to be investigated by the task force is the use of the technology for state record-keeping – a use case previously explored in states like Vermont. In that case, though, a group created by local lawmakers ultimately argued against a state-backed blockchain project.  The new Illinois Legislative Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Task Force, as it is called, now has a deadline of 1st January to submit its report to the legislature.  To date, the state has pursed an ambitious blockchain agenda through its Illinois Blockchain Initiative, aimed at envisioning how the tech could be implemented across a range of government services. As part of that investigation, the IDFPR joined the R3 distributed ledger consortium in March.  Illinois officials are also looking to the startup space for ideas. Notably, Saturday, 1st July, marks the first day of the month-long IBI Hack, an educational initiative open to students and recent university graduates.

42379549,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88d85,1498827628,Swift Completes Blockchain Smart Contracts Trial,"Interbank messaging platform Swift has completed a blockchain proof-of-concept in partnership with startup SmartContract.  The proof-of-concept, revealed today, is the first project to use SmartContract’s ChainLink v1.0, which lets users connect smart contracts to data feeds, web APIs and a number of payment methods.  While few details about the project have been released, SmartContract founder Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk:  ""We have successfully completed a phase one PoC with Swift, and are in active conversations about how to move further with the work we've done.""  The news coincides with the startup's rebranding of the ChainLink product, which was previously titled SmartContract Oracle.  Token sale  Founded last year, New York-based SmartContract was one of several blockchain startups to be selected by Swift to win a contract at its 2016 Sibos conference. A representative of Swift confirmed to CoinDesk that it is a SmartContract customer. Swift is currently working on multiple blockchain projects with various vendors.  Since being awarded the contract, SmartContract has also partnered with Ari Juels from blockchain think tank IC3 to provide authenticated data on the daily ether-to-US dollar conversion price for the TownCrier oracle.  Notably, the startup is currently preparing for a pre-sale of its own cryptographic token called LINK, with a public crowdsale to follow.  According to SmartContract, the token will be used to power its network. An email sent to users explains:  ""The LINK token will be used to pay ChainLink node operators for participating in a ChainLink network, allowing the creation of fully decentralized oracle networks.""

42379553,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88dBr,1498824020,Delaware Blockchain Stock Bill Likely to Advance in House Vote Today,"Budget cuts in Delaware are ""sucking the air out of the room,"" according to a corporate lawyer who has been following the US state's efforts to amend incorporation law to legalize the issuance of stocks on a blockchain.  As $51m have been slashed from the state's budget, important issues such as votes on legislative changes to the state's death penalty and marijuana policies will likely be cast aside until next year.  Even so, local lawyer Matthew O'Toole, chair of the corporate law section of the Delaware bar association, believes long-planned blockchain amendments won't be overlooked.  In interview with CoinDesk, O'Toole asserted that a state legislator ""in a position to know"" confirmed to him that the amendments will be put to a vote today in the state's House of Representatives, the last day legislators can cast such a vote until next year.  Further, O’Toole expressed confidence the bill will pass, stating:  ""A couple of high-profile issues are basically going to be tabled until next year because they've got bigger fish to fry. But the corporate bills are important, everybody recognizes that, and I'm assured that they will be voted on and they will pass.""  The vote, expected later today, is the final step before the state's governor, John Carney, would then sign the bill into law, completing a process that started last year when the previous governor began a push to embrace blockchain innovation.  The bill was formally introduced in May of this year and approved by Senate earlier this month. If the amendments pass in the house, this would explicitly make it legal for companies to store their records – including stock ledgers – on a blockchain.  O’Toole said he expects Governor Carney to sign the bill into law by the end of July, with the legislation going into effect 1st August.

42379550,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88d9L,1498818610,The $28-Billion Challenge: Can Ethereum Scale to Meet Demand?,"For all the recent successes, this much is clear: ethereum is still far from becoming the ""world computer"" its engineers originally envisioned.  The best example of ethereum's in-progress status arguably occurred earlier this month, when the world's second largest blockchain by investment saw record-high transaction activity thanks in part to a single popular initial coin offering (ICO). The sale, which saw users compete to purchase a new token for an application called Status, ended up affecting the entire network, now valued at more than $28bn, causing it to run more slowly for all users.  Due in part to how the specific ICO was engineered, users struggled to get transactions and contract updates processed, while a group of exchanges temporarily shuttered ether trades to deal with the congestion.  In response, the cryptocurrency world was abuzz.  On the one hand, enthusiasts had every reason to be excited about the burst in ethereum use. The downside, however, was that ethereum effectively buckled at a level of capacity that wasn't even close to where its engineers want to take it.  Critics quipped that while the goal is for ethereum to replace today’s internet, the platform couldn't even handle one fundraiser (if, admittedly, a big one).  Further, the growing pains point to another growing disconnect – the gap between how the platform is advertised by its sometimes zealous users and what its current capabilities are. (The price of ether, for instance, has increased by more than 3,000% since the end of 2016, even despite a recent price dip.)  The issues raise important questions for the ambitious blockchain platform. Namely, will ethereum ever be able to scale to support a large number of users? And, just how many will it be able to accommodate?  Future technology  To put ethereum's issues into context, all open blockchains, including bitcoin, have capacity problems. In fact, for the last two years, the bitcoin community has been arguing about the best way to increase its limited capacity without compromising decentralization, the characteristic that sets bitcoin apart as a payment network.  While newer ethereum investors might not be familiar with these big-picture problems, its developers have been experimenting with potential solutions since even before the platform launched in 2015.  More recently, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin put forth an idea for boosting transaction speeds on the network during congestion periods like the one seen last week. If implemented, ethereum would be able to handle eight ICOs at the same time, rather than just one.  But while this could help with transaction throughput in the short term, it's still a long way from what ethereum enthusiasts envision. (In the future, for example, some have even gone so far as to imagine scenarios where every article on the internet would become a mini-ICO).  The short version of that conclusion is that ethereum can’t support many users or apps right now, but with the help of up-and-coming technologies, the hope is that it will one day be able to.  Off-chain solutions  Of these technologies, ""payment channels"" are probably the furthest along.  The in-progress Raiden Network, an ethereum implementation inspired by bitcoin's Lightning Network, adds an extra layer to the ethereum blockchain that could increase transaction throughput from roughly 13 per second to as many as a million. And a minimum viable product of the technology could be ready by the end of the year, according to the most recent update from Consensys engineer Ameen Soleimani.  In order to work as planned, though, ethereum needs to scale not just for payments, but for a range of non-financial smart contracts – the technology that separates it from older public blockchains such as bitcoin.  Payment channels do not help smart contracts to scale, though. So-called ""state channels"" aim to take the idea further by applying the same off-blockchain payment technology to smart contracts.  At least one project claims to have already created state channel technologies that work for its decentralized applications, although the technology is not open-source. Some developers are also working to standardize this technology to work for a range of use cases, so developers don't have to build state channels from scratch to work for their specific apps.  Another project, TrueBit, uses a similar idea.  In order to scale ethereum's computations, the idea is to execute smart contracts off-chain instead of running them directly on the blockchain. Then, smart contracts can be kicked back to the blockchain when necessary to resolve disputes.  But, like state channels, it's still mostly in the concept stage for now, though the team recently set up the TrueBit Foundation with the goal of chipping away at the code and turning it into ""a living, breathing system.""  Sharding  Then there is a longer-term, and more theoretical, scaling idea that borrows from the world of traditional databases.  When asked about scaling, National University of Singapore PhD student Loi Luu was quick to mention sharding – a theory that suggests that each node would only need to store a subset of the data – and how it could be a more powerful way of boosting ethereum's computational capacity.  Still, Luu said the problem isn't going to be fixed overnight: he expects it will take another 1–2 years to implement the technology.  ""The high-level idea is clear, but how to do it practically? The community needs to work on it for quite some time,"" he said. ""Everyone knows what they want to achieve, it's just a matter of how.""  Too much 'hand-waving'?  Still, while some like Luu are optimistic that engineers will find a way for ethereum to support more users, others are skeptical.  Some in the cryptocurrency community have long been critical of ethereum's ambitions. The traditional argument is that, because it aims to take blockchain technology beyond currency, it needs to store more data than a less flexible platform like bitcoin. (To that point, despite being years younger than bitcoin, ethereum now requires users to store more data.)  Coinkite CEO and co-founder Rodolfo Novak said, for that reason, he's skeptical of the platform in general. He even went as far as to remark: ""I'm surprised [ethereum] has lasted this long.""  He took issue with the concept of sharding, in particular, noting that the tech is still in the white-boarding stages.  Novak concluded with a warning:  ""There is a lot of hand-waving tech and very good marketing. That, to me, is an irresponsible level of irrational exuberance. It won't end well.""  Still, many users and companies are anticipating that such scaling technologies, will one day be made to work. And advocates argue that it's still very much the early days for ethereum.  In the Medium post ""Scaling Ethereum to Billions of Users,"" Fred Ehrsham – who formerly co-founded Coinbase and now advises blockchain startups – argued that a current bottleneck is that very few developers are working on each scalability project right now.  Whatever the case, perhaps last week's issues will push the network's current limitations further into the limelight and bring a sharper focus on the issue for those involved.
