42426265,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLezh,1423608924,Plan to Distribute Bitcoin in Dominica Shelved,"UPDATED (10th February 2015, 3:30am GMT): Updated with comment from project manager Sarah Blincoe.      An event expected to involve the distribution of bitcoin to 70,000 residents of Dominica has been canceled.  Originally scheduled for 14th March, The Bit Drop was billed as an island-wide party that would include free giveaways and educational booths, alongside more eclectic fare such as fire dancing and musical acts.  The decision was confirmed by The Bit Drop Organising Committee, which cited “country-specific logistical decisions” as the reason for the cancellation.  A spokesperson indicated that the project is currently seeking to uncover ways it could move forward on its planned initiative, stating:  ”We are still passionate about bringing Let The Bit Drop to fruition and hope that we will be able to re-instate this pioneering project in the future.”  The event was a joint venture between wealth management company Aspen Assurance, women’s bitcoin interest group Bitcoin Beauties, bitcoin services provider Coinapult and the College Cryptocurrency Network.  Negotiations stall  Speaking to CoinDesk, members of the Coinapult team expressed their regret about the decision given the year-and-a-half of effort from the organising parties.  CEO Ira Miller explained that negotiations for the event broke down when its hosts in the Dominica did not provide promised support.  ""This is particularly sad, as a number of alternative Caribbean venues were available, had we known Dominica would not follow through,"" he said.  Miller indicated that there was interest in continuing the event at another venue, however, this proposal wasn't possible given time constraints.  Project manager Sarah Blincoe echoed these remarks, suggesting that the Dominica government never met certain project deliverables, such as issuing a press release for the event. Further, she indicated an election cycle on the island nation complicated matters.  Blincoe, however, was optimistic, emphasizing how she remains close with island residents who have become bitcoin supporters.  Refund effort underway  Organisers indicated that they aim to make “every effort” to ensure participants are notified and that they have initiated a refund process for those who donated to the event.  Those who donated have been notified of the cancellation by email.  Supporters were previously encouraged to donate 0.1 BTC in order to win a trip to the Dominica for the event.

The Business Forum panel will discuss cryptographic protocols and their potential impact on correspondent banks, those that provide services to other financial entities.  Head of banking markets Wim Raymaekers will moderate the panel, which will include Cheryl Gurz, managing director of the Emerging Technology Segment at BNY Mellon Treasury Services; Marc Hochstein, editor in chief of American Banker; and New York Law School professor and Coin Center fellow Houman Shadab.  The payments communications network is the creator of the Business Identifier Codes (BICs), more commonly known as SWIFT codes, which are required of banks to process wire transfers.  Panelists will discuss the way cryptographic protocols are affecting and challenging wire transfer, automated clearinghouse (ACH) payments and other existing technologies and money-moving solutions for global banking and cross-border payments.  ""The practice of correspondent banking [is] still at the heart of most cross-border payments. However, every day we read announcements in the press about new entrants, startups and crypto-protocols challenging correspondent banking,"" the event summary reads.  SWIFT works with more that 10,800 banking and securities institutions worldwide. It is also the host of the annual SIBOS conference for financial services industry members.  The Business Forum will take place 3rd March at the Marriott Marquis in New York. The crypto-protocols panel is scheduled to begin at 13:30.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/10/swift-event-to-discuss-bitcoins-impact-on-banking,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42426268,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLfBh,1423599337,Meet the 13 Candidates Running in Next Week's Bitcoin Foundation Election,"Elections for the Bitcoin Foundation are set for 13th to 19th February, following a race less than a year ago that brought new light to the purpose and standards of the organisation.  After widespread frustration with the last round of elections and appointments, a number of Bitcoin Foundation members canceled their memberships over concerns about the general direction of the organisation.  In the year since, extra attention has been paid to the Bitcoin Foundation by all in the bitcoin ecosystem, prompting it to refine its mission. Under current executive director Patrick Murck, the foundation has focused on developing the bitcoin protocol while trying to repair its perception in the media.  This February election aims to fill the two individual membership seats currently held by outgoing executive director Jon Matonis and current chief scientist Gavin Andresen.  Nominations closed on Friday with the 13 candidates below.  Jim Harper  Harper is a senior fellow at libertarian research group the Cato Institute, and until last month, served as the foundation’s global policy counsel.  Prior to assuming his responsibilities at the foundation he was the Cato Institute director of information policy studies for almost 10 years, and has acted as counsel to various committees in the US House of Representatives and the Senate.  He has also counseled PayPal, VeriSign and other payments companies during his time in Washington.  Bruce Fenton  He is also the advisor and organizer of the Dubai Bitcoin Conference, Satoshi Roundtable and the forthcoming New England Bitcoin Conference.  Notably, Fenton has positioned his candidacy as one that would seek to expand the foundation's recently limited operations.  “I agree with the need to simplify and focus the Bitcoin Foundation on core Dev,” he said of his candidacy on the Foundation forums. “I'd also like to see the voice of the foundation used to reduce regulation and educate lawmakers and global regulators if it can be done in a cost-effective manner.”  Theo Chino  A New York-based information technology and services consultant, Chino is an activist in the French Socialist Party and a former Green Party candidate in the New York City mayoral race.  He has worked to see the bitcoin symbol and currency ISO code officially recognized, and last year he opened a case in the Court of Claims against New York State Department of Financial Services superintendent Ben Lawsky over his supposed abuse of power in seeking to regulate bitcoin.  Michael Perklin  Perklin is a cybersecurity expert with more than a decade of experience in information security. He has previously acted as a cyber investigator, digital-forensic investigator, reverse engineer, application tester and computer programmer.  Currently a principal at Bitcoinsultants, he is a bitcoin security firm that carries out security audits, source-code reviews, penetration tests and implements cold storage solutions.  I will do everything I can to help publish complete standards for professionals, bitcoin software, security, and more,” he said on the Foundation forums. “These standards will ensure that every developer, piece of software and business has a clear path to certification.”  Jeremy Gardner  Gardner is the cofounder of the College Cryptocurrency Network, the nonprofit student network taking bitcoin to colleges worldwide, and operations director at Augur, a decentralized prediction market platform.  If elected he intends to bring a greater sense of democracy to the Foundation while focusing on the growth of the blockchain technology.  ""What became clear to me, almost immediately, was that I have to serve as a representative of the future of the blockchain,"" he told CryptoCoinNews. ""If elected to the Board, I fully intend to serve [...] those in the 'bitcoin 2.0' space, who are building the technologies with the potential to radically shape the world.""  Cody Wilson  He has been outspoken on his goal to try to disband the Foundation from within if he is elected, saying:  ""I will run on a platform of the complete dissolution of the Bitcoin Foundation and will begin and end every single one of my public statements with that message.""  Dima Starodubcev  Starodubcev is a cyber•Fund architect and the creator of cyber•Shares. An Early bitcoin miner and investor in Ethereum, MaidSafe and BitShares, he aims to make this election of directors the last at the Foundation.  “If the Bitcoin Foundation does not evolve,” he has said, “bitcoin will have significantly lower chances to be successful.”  Among his steps to betterment is creating greater transparency of Foundation operations by utilizing the blockchain.  Olivier Janssens  Janssens is an early bitcoin adopter, entrepreneur and investor; a significant backer in Eris and Lighthouse, the bitcoin-powered crowdfunding application, and the creator of the $100,000 bounty for software that could replace the Foundation.  The Monaco-based bitcoin millionaire and Bitcoin Foundation lifetime member has been outspoken on privacy issues for bitcoin users, believing that the Foundation’s agenda should continue and strive to become more decentralization, increase positive bitcoin awareness and remove any control of bitcoin by the Foundation.  Francis Pouliot  Pouliot is a public policy analyst and cryptocurrency researcher, the CEO of the Bitcoin Foundation Canada and director of public affairs at the Bitcoin Embassy.  By misallocating and mismanaging resources that are necessary to support technical development, he says, the Foundation has been unable to reach its potential and disappointed many of its members.  “Technical development will become the Bitcoin Foundation’s only essential mission and main expenditure,” he said of his visionhttps://bitcoin.consider.it/francis-pouliot, if elected. “Any other activities will be undertaken strictly with the rationale of obtaining resources and tools to protect and develop Bitcoin’s technological infrastructure.”  Vinny Lingham        Lingham is the CEO of Gyft, a mobile gift card startup and its growing bitcoin customer base.  A proponent of blockchain technology, he recently invested in Trustatom for its blockchain-based due diligence service. Lingham has always been keen on peer-to-peer finance having grown up in South Africa, giving him an early sense of bitcoin’s potential to transform local and foreign markets.  He ran for a spot on the board last year, coming in third place.  Scott Morgan  Scott Morgan is the co-founder of AirBitz, a mobile bitcoin wallet company that aims to onboard rookie bitcoin users, and the BTC Journal. He has more than 25 years' experience insurance, financial, and software startups.  Privacy, anonymity, decentralization and the advancement of the bitcoin technology are just some of the things he intends to concentrate on as a member of the Board.  When asked for his position on a formal 'code of ethics' for foundation directors, he said: ""Developing a list of sanctions would only act to foster the very system that we are attempting to replace, that is developing a false sense of moral guidelines etched on a piece of paper.""  Bayan Towfiq  He holds degrees in Information and Computer Science and Physics from the University of California at Irvine.  Colin Gallagher  A member of the Bitcoin Foundation’s education committee, Gallagher is running on a platform that he defines broadly as being pro-user choice, bitcoin development, privacy and anonymity.  Gallagher has also made known what he is against in the industry, notably seeking to distance himself the Windhover Principles, a framework of proposals that seek to define how bitcoin companies will seek to deal with issues of transparency and identity.  In a recent interview with CryptoCoinsNews, Gallagher spoke out about a number of issues, including his belief that the Bitcoin Foundation should not engage with government regulators  Correction: An earlier version of this article omitted Colin Gallagher.

42426258,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLenh,1423589113,When is a Token a Security? Research Analyzes Blockchain Under US Law,"UPDATE (10th February, 2015 19:25pm GMT): The complete report has been added below.      The legal questions surrounding the use of the bitcoin blockchain and similar decentralized ledgers for non-financial purposes took a step toward clarity today with the release of a 30-page working paper.  The publication is the result of a workshop held 15th to 18th January at which decentralised crowdfunding startup Swarm, DATA's Constance Choi and Harvard Berkman Center research fellow Primavera de Fillippi assembled thought leaders in the bitcoin legal space to address challenges facing the part of the industry referred to as the crypto 2.0 sector.  Attendees included Andy Beal, Elizabeth Stark and John Clippinger, and members of policy group Coin Center, law firm Perkins Coie and Harvard and MIT.  The representation at the event is indicative of what participants described as the potential of the bitcoin blockchain to spur innovations, as well as the current unclear regulatory environment in which such startups now operate in the US.  De Filippi, a research fellow at , told CoinDesk:  ""Distributed networks can be used to promote the public good and encourage cooperation amongst peers. That's why I'm excited about the pioneering legal work we've been doing. It is opening the door for new opportunities that the current regulatory framework is currently having a hard time to cope with.""  The full report analyzes a number of pressing questions facing the space, including under which circumstances tokens issued by decentralised projects meet the traditional definitions of a security. The hot-button issue first surfaced in October, when rumors that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the industry emerged.  Notably, the report finds that under certain conditions, cryptographic tokens are likely to meet such definition and potentially trigger regulatory scrutiny.  “Somewhat more controversially, these tokens can also be pre­-sold or exchanged for other tokens in order to fund the development of the project. This type of sale raises significant concerns with respect to securities guidelines,” the report reads.  However, it stresses that due to the wide variety of use cases for the technology, some tokens may qualify as private property, while others are likely to be viewed as securities.  The full paper examines this issue, as well as the broader implications decentralised ledger technologies to enable Internet users new levels of ownership and control.  Crowdsales and securities law  Long a contentious topic in the digital currency community, crowdsales have emerged as a popular way for crypto 2.0 startups to raise awareness and capital, while inspiring a dedicated user base to help them reach lofty goals in a short amount of time.  Despite objections from some community members, notable projects in the space have argued that tokens sold during these events provide access to the technology, not ownership as in a traditional stock purchase. Further, their terms and conditions often seek to denote that the token is not intended to be a security.  The working group found that tokens are less likely to be viewed as a security under two conditions – the software is already available at the time of sale, and the token is not transferable to another party.  ​“Generally speaking a software access token which is expected to appreciate in value and is largely obtained for profit is likely to be considered a security. This is particularly the case if the token represents a good which is not available at the time of purchase and which depends on the effort of others in order to deliver,” the report reads.  Key distinctions  In reaching this conclusion, the report also highlights a variety of relevant case law while illustrating the specific variables that are likely to shape the definition of a given token.  Conditions that are likely to influence this categorization include whether the project is already built at the time of the token sale; the specific rights associated with the token; and whether tokens are transferable and divisible on the open market.  Tokens that are “exhaustable”, meaning they are only built for one-time use, the report suggests, are likely to fall under different case law than tokens that are meant to trade.  ​”Redeemable product tokens serve a similar function as a coupon for a good and generally fall into the same regulatory guidelines that apply to Kickstarter or other perks-­based models,” the report says, adding that depending on the rights associated with the token, they may fall under the definition of securities.  Most important may be the basis of the token’s underlying value. The paper puts forth the opinion that whether the token is likely to appreciate with the effort of others, is sold with the expectation of profit or is dependant on a collaborative process for value is likely to shape its definition under US law.  Copyright law and proof of purchase  Yet another application of crypto 2.0 technology is in the form of copyright law, as projects have emerged that seek to use blockchains as a way to create records that a particular work was made at a certain time.  The paper suggests that cryptographic tokens provide a solution to these problems, enabling the ability to prove that a digital good is being purchased for the first time or whether it is being resold.  “By linking the distribution of a work to the transmittal of a scarce token with associated rights, one can ensure that a used­ good retailer has verifiably relinquished legal control of the copy to the used­ good purchaser. Subsequent purchasers and sellers are no longer violating the right to distribute because that right has been extinguished by the first sale doctrine,” the report states.  It goes on to provide an example of how this type of token meets the condition of a security, arguing it is “not a security by any usual definitions”, but that it could be depending on whether the user has an expectation of profit or some financial interest.  DAOs get greenlight  Another use case that the authors view as less problematic through the lens of US law is the use of tokens to create distributed collaborative organisations (DAOs).  In this instance, tokens are used to denote membership in an organisation, with the user retaining the expectation that he or she may benefit financial from the ownership.  The report suggests that, in this case, token owners may have some control over fund utilization, “making them effectively managers and/or partners in the success of the entity”, a factor that makes them less likely to be viewed as securities.  ​”Depending on the nature of the organization and the actual control held by people who have committed capital, ‘shares’ organizations which are structured on the blockchain are likely not to be considered as securities,” the paper suggests.  Smart contracts don’t meet standard definitions  One of the most often discussed abilities of blockchain ledgers is their ability to help execute smart contracts, digital contracts between two parties that are automatically enforced when certain conditions are met.  The paper notes that such contracts are applicable to a wide variety of fields, including derivatives, escrow services, swaps and voting mechanisms.  Notably, the working group found that smart contracts aren’t likely to meet the legal definition of a contract in their current form, but that they could be made to better fit this definition.  “There may be an implied legal contract depending on the nature of the contextual language used, which implies a certain set of outcomes from the computer code,” the report reads.  The findings comes at a time when the crypto 2.0 industry is seeing increased development and interest and are likely to add clarity to the discussion surrounding these projects.

42426257,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLelh,1423582121,247Exchange Adds Fiat Withdrawals for Credit and Debit Cards,"International bitcoin brokerage 247exchange has added credit and debit cards as a withdrawal method.  The startup, which integrated card support for buying bitcoin at the end of last year, is now enabling Visa and Mastercard users to easily convert bitcoin – and other cryptocurrencies – into fiat.  Alexey Maximenko, 247exchange's CEO, said:  ""If you look at the market, you’ll see that only a few companies offer such a service. Maybe we’re not the pioneers, but we’re among the first ones.""  In order to use a debit or credit card, users will need to create a sell order by filling in a form.  According to the company, the funds should reach the user's card in approximately one to three days, once the transaction has been confirmed.  Withdrawal fees  Withdrawal fees on the platform were recently decreased from 3% to 1.5%.  Anton Vereshchagin, founder of InterMoneyExchange which runs 247exchange, added that they ""will be lowered [again] in future"".  Credit and debit card users also face a $6.50 charge established by the payment processor. However, Vereshchagin insists the service is still competitively priced:  ""Compared to international bank transfers, credit card withdrawals are a very affordable way to withdraw small or medium amounts of coins.""  Marketing director Andrey Vereshchagin added that the company's mission is to ""create and provide the new standard of digital currency exchange service all over the world – fast, convenient, secure and available for everyone"".  Shift in focus  Although Anton Vereshchagin initially intended to open 247exchange in the Russian market, the changing regulations meant that InterMoneyExchange Corp shifted its focus to Europe late last year.  The company recently added Sofort Banking as a payment method, allowing consumers in 10 European countries to purchase bitcoin.  InterMoneyExchange Corp is currently registered in Belize.

42426260,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLevh,1423574818,Bitnet Partnership Opens Up 260 Airlines to Bitcoin Payments,"Universal Air Travel Plan (UATP), a payment network owned by major international airlines such as American Airways, British Airways and Lufthansa, has partnered with bitcoin payment processor Bitnet.  The integration allows over 260 of UATP’s airlines to accept bitcoin through Bitnet, starting today. Introduced in 1936, UATP is credited with issuing the first-ever charge card. As of 2014, the company processes around $14bn in payments from corporate customers, travel agents and retail consumers.  Additional UATP merchants include JetBlue, Qantas, US Airways and United Airlines.  Akif Khan, vice president of solutions strategy at Bitnet, said he expects the airline’s clients to enable the payment method given the high cost of credit card processing, challenges with fraud mitigation and the need for improved cross-border payment tools.  Khan told CoinDesk:  ""It's very much in the airlines’ interest for the consumer to pay with bitcoin given that the airline will have cheaper fees and they know that money can't be taken away in a fraudulent transaction.""  UATP vice president of marketing and communication Wendy Ward said her company’s decision reflects the ""interest shown by many carriers"" in bitcoin. Notably, UATP has long been an advocate for emerging payment methods, adding PayPal integration in 2009 and partnering with Alipay in 2013.  Though no airlines will accept bitcoin at launch, Khan expects the partnership will do much to encourage these businesses to enter commercial agreements with his firm.  ""It's putting a foundation in place that enables this global network of airlines to have a much lower barrier to entry if they wish to accept bitcoin,"" he added.  UATP will not charge added fees for bitcoin processing, however, it did confirm that Bitnet is compensating it for the ability to process transactions through its network.  Airline appeal  Khan suggested Bitnet is currently in talks with a number of UATP partner airlines. During this process, he added, the company will emphasize its payments industry background and ability to channel this knowledge into an improved product.  ""We all understand the payment ecosystem,"" Khan said. ""This partnership sends a clear message to airlines we're not coming in to see you to talk about how great bitcoin is, we understand how your airline payment systems work, we understand the legacy airline ecosystem and we understand how hard it is to make changes to those systems.""  Khan explained that bitcoin transactions enabled through UATP’s 'lightweight integration' with Bitnet will appear the same as other UATP transactions. This means airlines can refund customers in bitcoin through Bitnet while avoiding the need to build special reporting capabilities for the new payment method.  Ward, in turn, suggested UATP carriers may be interested in bitcoin because of its ability to drive new global customers, while noting the benefits of Bitnet’s integration.  ""Carriers interested in accepting bitcoin now have an easier method of acceptance – basically allowing a new form of payment to be processed ... as if it is a more traditional form of payment,"" he said.  Consumers first  Echoing recent discussion in the industry, Khan conceded that certain UATP demographics may be better suited to the program than others.  For example, while bitcoin may be appealing to merchants in general, its ability to compete in the developed world against more mature payments offerings may be farther off, he said.  Still, Khan noted that the UATP program is aimed at general consumers, as it will enable merchants to simply add a ‘pay with bitcoin’ button to their website. Further, he suggested the option could become popular for airlines serving areas where local payment methods are susceptible to competition.  He said:  “In emerging markets, the ability to pay with bitcoin gives a way for an airline to take a payment online from a consumer in a way that they cannot do today.”  This point was also touched on by Ward, who noted “Bitcoin users are global,” and that “some merchant carriers may be attracted to a global payment option such as bitcoin.”  Khan added that his company is talking to airlines in more developed markets about ways to incentivize users to pay with bitcoin, noting that the option could be paired with perks such as fewer fees, more airline points or free in-flight services.  Solving real problems  Though careful not to overstate the immediate impact of the program, Khan did stress that he sees bitcoin as an attractive prospect for the airline industry, given its recent revenue struggles.  He added:  “All it takes is just a few seats to be sold fraudulently and it could make that whole flight unprofitable. So for the airlines, bitcoin’s fraud mitigation aspects are also interesting.”  This benefit could extend to the wider travel industry, Khan said, which sometimes turns down potentially lucrative sales because of fraud concerns.  “One online travel agency we spoke to gave the example of a first-time customer who was booking a round the world ticket costing tens of thousands of dollars and they declined the transaction because it was too risky,” he explained.  Overall, Khan suggested that the UATP deal signals the change in tone his company is bringing to the bitcoin industry, with its strong emphasis on traditional payments.  He concluded:  “This sends the message to others that we're coming to help you take bitcoin payments in a way that fits in with your existing legacy infrastructure. We're coming at the bitcoin space as payments professionals.”  Airplane image via Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.com",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/10/bitnet-partnership-opens-up-260-airlines-to-bitcoin-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20e0aece27b9fe74b451015cd7cdac48b6ab20a3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426269,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLf7h,1423572627,ChangeTip Now Lets Users Redirect Tips to Charity,"Micropayments startup ChangeTip is launching a new feature that allows users to automatically direct any tips they receive to charitable causes.  The US-based bitcoin company has initially partnered with the BitGive Foundation, enabling users to pass on bitcoins they receive to support the organization directly.  The 'tip-redirect' function will see more options and improved functionality as development progresses over coming weeks and months, according to ChangeTip.  The focus on charitable giving was suggested in a December interview with ChangeTip CEO Nick Sullivan, who said at the time that bitcoin donations would form a key element of the company's strategic plans for 2015.  ChangeTip's head of community Victoria van Eyk and BitGive founder and executive director Connie Gallippi explained that the goal of the partnership is to facilitate more channels for charitable giving. The partnership, they say, is the first step toward building an ecosystem for micropayments.  Van Eyk said that BitGive will provide ChangeTip with feedback on the redirect feature in the hopes of making it a more effective channel for donations.  She told CoinDesk:  ""If we can just reduce the friction for giving and make it more of a daily feature – even with small payments, like if you were to give 25 cents – and all of us were doing that, now you're crowdfunding big social change.""  The launch follows the recent rollout of the company's Facebook integration. Notably, ChangeTip, which is headquartered in San Francisco, raised $3.5m in seed funding in December.  Shared vision  The redirect feature, Gallippi said in an interview, is one of a number of ideas generated during recent talks with ChangeTip.  Gallippi noted that BitGive and ChangeTip have been discussing potential collaborations since last year, citing a ""shared vision"" between the two companies.  She explained:  ""Microdonations, in and of themselves, open up a whole new way of giving for charities that was never really cost-effective before. It's not exclusive to ChangeTip, but they've made features that make it easy and fun, and bitcoin, really, has opened that up.""  ""We're just really excited to be working with them and excited to be the first charity that they have incorporated into this new feature,"" she added.  'Bitcoin push' ahead  ChangeTip plans to continue developing the feature, which could see more sophisticated tip redirection capabilities in the future, possibly forming the infrastructure for a system of automated, tip-based charity drives.  ""It's the first iteration of what I see as a much more intricate feature that is going to come out this year,"" van Eyk explained.  The partnership with BitGive is just the first of many cooperative efforts planned, according to van Eyk, and that the startup is looking to other companies in the bitcoin space with which to collaborate.  ""We're going to start all working together to start pushing bitcoin forward and I'm super excited about that,"" she said.

42426253,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLefh,1423567703,Hong Kong Central Bank Warns Against Bitcoin Following Alleged Scam,"Members of the public should exercise extra caution when considering an investment in bitcoin because of the digital currency's ""highly speculative"" nature, Hong Kong's central bank has said.      The Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a statement in the wake of reports that a bitcoin exchange and investment scheme called MyCoin had disappeared with an estimated $386.9m of customers' funds.      The public should evaluate all investment schemes carefully, regardless of whether they involve bitcoin, the central bank said.      The statement read:      ""We would like to remind members of the public to stay vigilant and guard against unscrupulous practices when participating in any investment plan, regardless of whether the products are bitcoin ... or any type of financial or non-financial assets.""              The HKMA reiterated its guidance around digital currencies like bitcoin issued in two circulars last year, saying it expected banks to be extra vigilant in dealings with clients who operate digital currency-related businesses, and that banks should pay extra attention to client controls against money laundering and terrorist financing.      The special administrative region's central bank said it defined bitcoin as a ""virtual commodity"" that does not qualify as a means of payment or electronic money. The bank added that it does not regulate bitcoin.      The figure of $386.9m allegedly stolen by MyCoin was first reported by Hong Kong daily the South China Morning Post. The SCMP said it derived the figure from the exchange's earlier claim that it had 3,000 clients in Hong Kong who each invested an average of $130,000.      Legislative Council member Leung Yiu-Chung has helped publicise the concerns of some 30 MyCoin customers who have been unable to obtain their funds from the investment scheme.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/10/hong-kong-central-bank-warns-against-bitcoin-following-alleged-scam,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42426259,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJLeth,1423563405,BitX Expands Bitcoin Buying Service to Indonesia,"Emerging market-focused bitcoin firm BitX has opened an office in Jakarta, Indonesia, bringing its services to a population of 252 million people in one of the world's fastest-growing economies.  In keeping with its other branches in places like Kenya and Malaysia, BitX Indonesia will recruit local staff to provide user support in a language and style familiar to the region's customers.  BitX  's service in Indonesia will center around a market-price buy-sell exchange, which CEO Marcus Swanepoel framed as being the most suitable service for the market.  BitX expects most customers to access the service through its mobile apps for Android and iOS, launched last November.  Customers can use the apps not only to buy and sell bitcoin in Indonesian rupiah on BitX's local exchange, but also to sign up for new accounts and complete the 'know your customer' (KYC) registration process.  The firm provides a series of API tools for developers to access and build their own apps as well, which hopefully encourages services to facilitate easier cross-border remittances and e-commerce.  Regional competition  With a median age of 27.9 and spending power on the rise, Indonesia presents a large and tantalizing market for bitcoin business. BitX will, however, likely face some competition.  Indonesia already has a number of established bitcoin companies offering a varied range of services.  One such is Bitcoin Indonesia, which has been operating since late 2013 and began offering a full open-order book exchange in March 2014.  Bitdoku  is another local exchange that has operated since 2013. There is also Quoine, the Singapore-based exchange marketed towards professional forex traders and offering margin trading and asset lending.  Time on the ground  However, the extra time BitX has taken to understand the regions in which it operates enables it to identify specific requirements to cater for local customer behavior and use cases, said Swanepoel.  ""(Indonesia is) very relationship-driven, so you need to spend a lot of time on the ground, have local teams with local understanding and networks, local operating structures, and also spend a lot more time in building a brand that people can trust, as these are often very low-trust environments.""  The company also places much faith in its reputation and believes the quality of the products it offers are world class.  Swanepoel indicated that new relationships in the country will also boost its cause:  ""We form partnerships with big corporates that other crypto companies don't tend to do, and will do so in Indonesia as well.""  The company also plans to continue its expansion into significant developing-economy markets around the world. Next on the list is Nigeria, where BitX will launch shortly to face South African exchange ICE3X, which opened there last month.
