42412224,MOJk0DFaTUQXthCtpVrjeQ,1651185025,First Mover Asia: Hong Kong Isn‚Äôt Sure if It Needs a CBDC,"Good morning. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether rise again; other major cryptos are mostly in the green.  Insights: Hong Kong wrestles with the need for a central bank digital currency.  Technician's take: BTC's current price action is similar to what occurred in 2018-2019.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $39,768 +1.4%  Ether (ETH): $2,923 +1.2%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Algorand ALGO +4.1% Smart Contract Platform Litecoin LTC +2.7% Currency EOS EOS +2.6% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM ‚àí4.3% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC ‚àí2.0% Smart Contract Platform Dogecoin DOGE ‚àí1.9% Currency  Bitcoin, ether increase for a second consecutive day  Bitcoin's price rose for a second consecutive day. But the surge seemed more a temporary aberration than the promise of better times ahead. The same conditions that have been weighing upon the crypto market over the past two months continue. No surprise the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy had shrunk during the first quarter.  Early Thursday, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization passed $40,000, the price midpoint during the last three months, and was more recently trading at about $39,750, up about 1.5% over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at about $2,920, a roughly 1.2% increase over the same period.  Bitcoin at $40,000 ""is an important level,"" wrote Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital. Yet, DiPasquale noted, the news wasn't surprising because $2 billion in bitcoin options will expire on Deribit ""with a maximum pain value"" at the current $40,000 level.  ""We can expect volatility after [Friday's] expiry, and the real level bulls still want to see reclaimed is $42,000,"" he wrote.  Other major cryptocurrencies were largely in the green, albeit not by much. TGH and ALGO were among the winners, with the former rising about 5% at one point and the latter over 2.5%. Trading was light and volatility remained muted as investors continue to watch events in Ukraine, tightening monetary policy aimed to curb inflation and unsettling economic data.  The paths of bitcoin and ether on Thursday tracked equity markets, which also rose for a second consecutive day and more robustly than Wednesday's microscopic gains. The Nasdaq jumped a hearty 3%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up roughly 2% each.  Tech Investors were apparently buoyed by Meta's (FB) report that it had increased users, sending the company's shares up more than 17%, while Apple (AAPL) notched better-than-expected results.  Still, other news was less promising. Amazon (AMZN) reported its first loss since 2015 while the Commerce Department announced that gross domestic product had declined to 1.4% annualized.  But the nature of the contraction will determine its impact on crypto markets, wrote Mark Lurie, the founder and CEO of Shipyard Software, a provider of crypto trading software.  ""It depends on how the U.S. economy contracts,"" Lurie wrote. ""If it's because of interest rate raises, that may dampen crypto market cap growth. Many investors have chased yields in crypto because interest rates returned so little; if they rise it may decrease the motivation to chase yields and thus to allocate to crypto.""  ""However, if the economy contracts and inflation drops, then interest rates will probably remain as is, in which case crypto will benefit.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,287 +2.2%  DJIA: 33,916 +1.8%  Nasdaq: 12,871 +3.0%  Gold: $1,894 +0.4%  Insights  Hong Kong's uncertainty about a CBDC  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Chinese Special Territory‚Äôs central bank, published a policy paper this week outlining the possible directions a Hong Kong-issued central bank digital currency (CBDC), which it's calling an e-HKD, could take.  CBDCs, a digital version of cash issued by central banks as opposed to money issued by commercial banks, has been explored by central banks worldwide, including Sweden, the Bahamas and Canada. But most critically for Hong Kong, its largest trading partner, China, has developed and is slowly deploying its own CBDC, called the e-CNY.  Each region has its own reasons for deploying a CBDC. In Sweden bankers are concerned about the declining use of cash; in the Bahamas the government looks to build out a system for financial inclusion; Canada‚Äôs central bank sees the need for increased competition for retail deposits; while the People‚Äôs Bank of China wants to wrestle away the control AliPay and WeChat pay have over the nation‚Äôs money supply.  All these issues brought up by other governments exist to some extent in Hong Kong. But HKMA‚Äôs assessment is that these issues don‚Äôt exist to the point of warranting the introduction of a retail-focused CBDC (which it calls a rCBDC in the paper).  ‚ÄúAlthough rCBDC is meant to be a digital extension of cash, its potential demand is highly uncertain,‚Äù the HKMA wrote. ‚ÄúThe potential holders may need to switch funds out of their deposit accounts for rCBDC, which would affect the balance sheets of commercial banks and lead to disintermediation of banks.‚Äù  The HKMA‚Äôs analysis shows potential for a squeeze on banks‚Äô interest margins and profitability because deposits will decline as consumers swap out bank deposits for an rCBDC where deposits are stored, with the central bank potentially adding costs (ironically) for consumers.  ‚ÄúBanks may also opt to pass the higher funding cost to their customers by imposing a higher lending spread,‚Äù the HKMA noted. ‚ÄúIn the remote case where the increase in funding cost and lending spread lead to a tightening in overall credit conditions, consumption and investment activities would inevitably be affected.‚Äù  The HKMA doesn‚Äôt see this as a scenario that is likely to play out because it's likely that an rCBDC would be unremunerated ‚Äì meaning it would be without an incentive structure in place like negative interest rates.  ‚ÄúThe attractiveness of e-HKD as a store of value over bank deposits should also be limited, and hence the bank disintermediation risk should be manageable,‚Äù the HKMA said.  On the customer-facing side, the HKMA isn‚Äôt exactly sure what pain points the rCBDC would address. Hong Kong, it said, already has a ‚Äúplethora of convenient retail payment options available‚Äù that are resilient and highly efficient. Mass adoption will only happen if there‚Äôs an obvious pain point that this solves.  This existential question of why a CBDC is really necessary has been brought up by central bankers before, in many of the countries that have explored the technology.  While consulting groups like Accenture (ACN) and their lackeys might produce white paper upon white paper extolling the virtues of the technology, it remains unclear if it's still a necessity.  A Bank of Canada research paper on the topic found there may be marginal theoretical gains from welfare distribution via CBDC, but the public‚Äôs perception of the platform‚Äôs net benefit remains a challenge.  Speaking on the topic in 2021, U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell came out as a skeptic about its necessity.  ‚ÄúThe real threshold question, for us, does the public want or need a new digital form of central bank money to complement what is already a highly efficient, reliable and innovative payments system?‚Äù he said at the time.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support; Resistance at $43K  Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a tight trading range with support at $37,500 and initial resistance at $43,000.  The cryptocurrency was trading around $39,000 at press time and is down 2% over the past week. BTC appears to be stabilizing on intraday charts, although upside could be limited into the Asia trading day.  Momentum signals have weakened over the past week, which typically precedes a period of flat to negative price action. For now, buyers have kept prices anchored around the $40,000 price level, albeit unwilling to decisively break above the $46,710 resistance level over the past three months.  A negative reading on weekly momentum indicators is on watch, which could increase the chance of a price breakdown.  Still, BTC is a few days away from registering a bullish countertrend signal, per the DeMARK indicators, which could delay the formation of an intermediate-term downtrend.  The current price action is similar to what occurred in 2018 and 2019, which was a long period of choppy trading and relatively low returns, similar to equities. At that point, the bitcoin price range was roughly $6,000 to $9,000.

Blockchain technology, no doubt, has the potential to disrupt various industries like financial services, supply chain, healthcare, etc. Similarly, it is very much capable of making the internet more equitable and out of the control of tech giants like Google, Meta, etc. As a result, DeFi swiftly establishes itself as a new paradigm that enables new types of value and utility not previously available in the old financial system. Handling funds in a crypto wallet in a non-custodian way is the beginning of restricting control of third parties over one&apos;s personal assets. This change is influenced by the global financial crisis of 2008-09 that led to the demise of companies like Lehman Brothers. Web3 and DeFi enthusiasts are pretty optimistic that this paradigm will eliminate &apos;too big to fail&apos; strategies used by countries to protect the institutions that unfairly played with the public&apos;s money and put the global financial system at risk. In this article, let&apos;s understand the critical components of DeFi that paved the way for Web3.

Bitcoin network activity stable, for now  Activity on the Bitcoin blockchain continues to hold up despite BTC's 40% price dip from the November peak around $69,000. Still, it remains uncertain whether transaction activity on the blockchain leads or reacts to changes in crypto prices.  For now, high transaction activity does not indicate a breakdown in bitcoin's fundamentals (use of the blockchain), according to some analysts.  The chart below plots the daily amount of BTC transferred as a percentage of total supply. CryptoQuant distinguishes high transaction activity as when the indicator is above its historical average. Further, the 30-day moving average remains elevated in a high range, unlike the 2018 bear market ‚Äì a period when activity declined with price.  Still, not all indicators show persistent network strength.  The next chart shows the number of active addresses on the Bitcoin network, according to data compiled by Glassnode. The metric only counts successful transactions and has been smoothed using a 30-day exponential moving average.  The number of active addresses has not surpassed its peak on May 13 of last year when BTC was trading around $49,700.

""We can't just establish bitcoin because that will be unconstitutional and if it's unconstitutional, then the project won't happen,"" said Silva, speaking on Twitter spaces. Panama has no currency per its constitution, but has officially been on the U.S. dollar for more than a century.  Prior to the bill, said Silva, it was illegal for digital asset companies to set up shop in Panama, but that would change once the legislation becomes law.  Additionally, he said, the law treats crypto assets as foreign-source income, which in accordance with Panama's territorial taxation system, means no taxes on capital gains.  ""The idea is to just respect the tradition that Panama has already had for many years, where the country taxes what happens inside of its borders, and the internet is obviously not in any country's borders,"" explained Felipe Echandi, a local crypto entrepreneur who assisted Silva in drafting the bill.  President Laurentino Cortizo still must sign the bill for it to become law, but the legislation was passed by a 40-0 vote, suggesting good prospects for that to happen.

42407290,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSwF,1651174532,The Crypto Company Aiding El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin Adoption,"When cryptocurrency company Athena Bitcoin launched in 2015, it vowed to become a key player in the brewing industry that we now know as cryptocurrencies. The Chicago-based company began conducting transactions via over-the-counter (OTC) desks, and provided early investors a platform on which to trade.  Matias A. Goldenh√∂rn, now the company‚Äôs Latin American director, joined the company in 2017. That same year, Athena deployed its first bitcoin (BTC) ATM to Bogota, Colombia, and afterwards, took the idea to Argentina.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Payments Week.  By 2019, the company saw interest in crypto take off, so it planted digital roots in Puerto Rico (though holding off in larger countries like Mexico, in part because of its sheer size and initial doubts as to whether a country so large, would adopt something so new).  Still in its infancy, by 2020, Athena Bitcoin had partnered with Bitcoin Beach, an initiative aimed at growing the Bitcoin ecosystem in the country‚Äôs coastal zone of El Zonte. A majority of residents there lacks access to bank accounts and local businesses fall short of qualifying for merchant accounts, which are needed to accept credit cards as a form of payment.  Last year, President Nayib Bukele submitted a bill to make bitcoin legal tender. Three days later, a supermajority of the country‚Äôs legislature voted in favor of the president‚Äôs proposal, and bitcoin was formally recognized as legal tender.  Read more: Why Banks and Payment Processors Shun Perfectly Legal Businesses  At this point, Athena had been considering whether deploying more ATMs would be viable. ‚ÄúWe decided to speed up our process,‚Äù Goldenh√∂rn said. ‚ÄúIt was crazy. Within a week of Bukele announcing, we were landing in El Salvador with more ATMs, essentially making a promise to support the initiative.‚Äù  It‚Äôs not all been an upward trajectory for Athena. Back in 2018, in Argentina, the platform found a problem when they launched Athena pay, a point-of-sale (PoS) payment system for charging in bitcoin. Athena quickly found that not as many people were looking to pay with bitcoin, and eventually the company ‚Äúlet it go dormant.‚Äù  In El Salvador, it partnered with the Chivo wallet built by the country‚Äôs government for its residents, which allows them to make transactions using bitcoin.  The decision to invest in more ATMs in El Salvador was based on the performance of the first set of donated ATMs in El Zonte and other areas in El Salvador, including El Tunco, a popular surfing area known as ‚Äúhippie heaven,‚Äù and San Salvador, the country‚Äôs capital.  ‚ÄúTypically, we don‚Äôt like to enter a market with one ATM because it‚Äôs not sustainable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need the market to be able to host a number of ATMs.‚Äù  Goldenh√∂rn sees the government‚Äôs ‚Äúairdrop‚Äù of $50 in BTC to all El Salvadoreans as giving residents greater access to financial services, ‚Äúespecially for people that had never had a bank account,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a novel concept to see your phone and see the money there,‚Äù Goldenh√∂rn said.  But it wasn‚Äôt all smooth sailing. There were initial setbacks for the company and its product. Some, ironically, were caused by too many people trying to download the wallet at the same time, Goldenh√∂rn said.  Read more: The Lightning Network Is Bringing Payments Back to Bitcoin  The relationship between Athena Bitcoin and President Bukele grew, in part, because of the quick rollout and because Bukele wanted to move forward with the project, despite lingering uncertainty around its success. That meant Athena would need to meet with the president to discuss deploying more ATMs that week following his announcement.  Goldenh√∂rn describes the young president as someone with ‚Äúa lot of energy‚Äù who ‚Äúputs the horsepower behind what he wants to do.‚Äù He also notes that President Bukele ‚Äúruns the country like a CEO‚Äù and was involved in every detail of the project, given the timeframe the company had.  ‚ÄúThree years ago, banks did not want to deal with bitcoin, let alone politicians,‚Äù he said. For Athena, landing a meeting with a bank manager was next to impossible and now, all of sudden, the Chicago-based company was working with the president of El Salvador.  But Goldenh√∂rn recognizes that a project of this magnitude would never be perfect. ‚ÄúI feel that if he‚Äôd have taken a lot longer to launch it, the project would not have come to realization because of all the opposition,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that any president would have the guts to go all-in on bitcoin in the near future,‚Äù he said. That being said, he doesn‚Äôt know what success would be exactly, because the experiment is so new.  What he does know is that Bukele exposed the whole country to bitcoin, and with ‚Äújust by being exposed to bitcoin a larger population of the country is going to find the value.‚Äù That does not mean that all residents will move to use bitcoin. Limited knowledge of the tech and the inherent volatility of bitcoin could back adoption.  But Goldenh√∂rn is convinced that Bukele is serious about his bitcoin revolution. ‚ÄúHe wants to rock the boat and shake the tree and change the rules of the game, so El Salvador at large, can be better,‚Äù he said.

42407293,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxT9T,1651174491,A Brief Overview of Crypto Payments in 5 Charts,"Bitcoin‚Äôs inception in 2009 was steeped in hopes of doing away with trusted third parties for online peer-to-peer transactions. In fact, that is the first sentence in the abstract of its white paper.  Given the evolution of Bitcoin over the last 13 years, most notably elevated transaction fees, various cryptocurrency projects and protocols have popped up as a means to send online payments, both on Bitcoin and on other blockchains. Be it the increased adoption of Bitcoin‚Äôs Lightning Network or the tremendous growth of the gaggle of stablecoins, both collateralized and algorithmic, there‚Äôs no denying that cryptocurrencies are hyper-focused on solving payments.  This article is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs Payments Week series.  What follows is a snapshot of various data figures that outline the state of crypto payments.  Bitcoin‚Äôs Lightning Network capacity  The Lightning Network is an overlay network or ‚Äúsecond layer‚Äù built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that uses user-generated micropayment channels to conduct transactions instantaneously. To generate those channels, users commit bitcoin (BTC) for a period of time. The sum of bitcoin committed to Lightning is known as its capacity. The larger the capacity, the more payment volume that can flow through the network.  Following muted growth between 2019 and mid-2021, Lightning‚Äôs capacity has increased rapidly in the last 12 months adding ~2,400 BTC, a growth rate of 195%. Of note, this data is representative only of the capacity in publicly announced channels ‚Äì unannounced, and therefore private, channels do exist. As a result, this data is an understatement of the total Lightning Network capacity.  Read more: An In-Depth Look Into the Lightning Network by CoinDesk Research  Lightning Network growth  Transactions over the Lightning Network are not announced publicly as they are on the regular Bitcoin blockchain; therefore, the actual usage rate of the Lightning Network is unknown. However, public data can be used to estimate payment volume and payment count.  According to data from Arcane Research, we‚Äôve seen payment volume and payment count grow consistently since the beginning of 2020. This continued growth highlights how Bitcoin is gaining ground on its original stated use case as a viable peer-to-peer digital cash through the use of the Lightning Network. The dip in payment volume in November 2021 coincides with the price of bitcoin tumbling from over $66,000 to $46,000 in December. All the while, payment count on Lightning ticked up even as bitcoin‚Äôs price dipped.  Read more: The Lightning Network is Bringing Payments Back to Bitcoin  Transaction values across coins vary widely  The seven coins included in this chart are defined by CoinDesk Indices' Digital Asset Classification Standard as part of the Currency Sector. Their primary function is to act as currency and make payments.  Looking at the transaction transfer value (the U.S. dollar amount of the asset value transferred) of these coins in combination with the total amount of transfers or transactions allows us to glean insight into each cryptocurrency‚Äôs usage.  A cryptocurrency blockchain could have many transactions, suggesting high levels of activity, but if the USD value of that activity is quite small it might suggest something else. This is the case with bitcoin SV (BSV). BSV has several million more transfers than other cryptocurrencies, yet the individual value of these transfers tends to be comparatively small. On average, BTC transfers $40,000 per transaction while BSV transfers $25.95 per transaction. After bitcoin, the next lowest value per transaction of the coins included in the data set is dash with $485 of value transferred per transaction.  Read more: What Is Going On With Bitcoin SV?  However, averages are skewed by large transactions, so looking at median transactions in USD can be quite useful in determining the actual usage of these cryptocurrencies for payments.  The 30-day trailing average for the median value transferred using bitcoin is $94 and $0.0005 for BSV. Both of these values skew to the high and low end value for casual commerce, so it might be the case that smaller casual crypto payments are being carried out using dogecoin (DOGE) or litecoin (LTC), which have median transaction values of $11 and $16, respectively.  Also worth a caveat is zcash and its relatively low median transaction value. Zcash is a privacy coin, but in order to use its privacy features, users must opt in. A regular zcash transaction is ‚Äúunshielded‚Äù and is called a ‚Äút‚Äù transaction. A user can choose to ‚Äúshield‚Äù their transactions in a ‚Äúz‚Äù transaction, where all information is not publicized. As such, our data is only able to include unshielded transactions. Given roughly one third of zcash transactions are shielded, the resultant data is likely skewed.  Stablecoin supply  Stablecoins are pegged to the price of a sovereign currency, usually the U.S. dollar. U.S.-pegged stablecoins play a vital role in payments, given their perceived lack of volatility and the dollar‚Äôs status as a globally accepted unit of account.  Tether (USDT), the first stablecoin, has long been the dominant stablecoin since inception, and there is now more than $80 billion of tether in circulation. Given its popularity, other stablecoins like USD coin (USDC) and terraUSD (UST) have popped up. In total, U.S.-pegged stablecoins now have more than $180 billion of market value.  While impressive, it is important to note that a sizable portion of stablecoins is used in crypto trading and decentralized finance (DeFi) versus peer-to-peer payments to buy things.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  Payments are a killer use case for coins for institutions  Improving payments represents one of the killer use cases for crypto assets, evidenced by the fact that there are so many different projects out there trying to do payments. In fact, money is one of humanity‚Äôs oldest technologies, and transacting with that money is a critical component of a successful money. Be it through cutting out third-party rent seekers or focusing on speed or perceived unit of account volatility risk, there is no shortage of options consumers have to make digital payments through crypto.  As with any network, it is important to understand the usage and pertinent metrics when determining the level of trust you want to put into these projects. Due to the transparency of blockchains, this type of insight can be gleaned with as little as an internet connection. That said, the main takeaway from the current data is that we have a long way to go.

Past Performance of Fantom Fantom is trading at around 2022 lows following sharp losses that forced the coin below Q1 2022 lows.

42412222,MOJk0DFaTUQXthCtpVrjXz,1651174073,US Lawmakers Reintroduce Bill to Give CFTC Crypto Spot Market Oversight,"A bipartisan set of U.S. lawmakers are introducing a bill that would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) a greater role in overseeing crypto spot markets.  The Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2022 (DCEA), introduced Thursday by representatives Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and Darren Soto (D-Fla.), would create a definition for ""digital commodity"" and allow the CFTC to oversee companies issuing or letting people trade these types of tokens, while having the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continue to oversee tokens that fall under U.S. securities laws.  ""The term 'digital commodity' means any form of fungible intangible personal property that can be exclusively possessed and transferred person to person without necessary reliance on an intermediary,"" a copy of the bill said.  The definition would not include any equity or debt interests, or securities (defined as ""a profit or revenue share derived solely from the managerial efforts of others"" in the bill). In other words, the SEC would continue to enjoy its own oversight over aspects of the crypto market.  These digital commodities could only be sold on a CFTC-registered exchange, which would have to abide by certain requirements which include holding customers' crypto in qualified custodians, safeguarding customer assets and prevent commingling customer and corporate funds, according to the bill.  This year's version of the DCEA is an updated version of a bill originally introduced in 2020 by former Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas). Members of the House Agriculture Committee, where Thompson is the ranking member, introduced an updated version last year.  Thompson announced in March during a hearing with CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam that he was continuing to work on the bill.  In a statement Thursday, Thompson said the bill was ""a culmination of years of work.""  ""Closing the spot-market gap is an essential piece of the regulatory puzzle, but more work remains. I look forward to working with my colleagues to bring greater clarity to crypto users and creators and I hope to see it move through the legislative process promptly,"" he said.  Khanna, a co-sponsor, said, ""To foster American innovation and tech job growth, Congress must establish a clear process for creating and trading digital commodities that prioritizes consumer protections, transparency and accountability.""",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/28/us-lawmakers-reintroduce-bill-to-give-cftc-crypto-spot-market-oversight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c45b4c8483d218ec101fa5dbe4a04239a55030f8-4928x3280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Best of all, the process took all of 30 seconds.  The hard part came when he paid me back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take cash or USDC-SOL,‚Äù I said.  Grace ‚ÄúOri‚Äù Kwan is the cofounder of Orca, a decentralized exchange on Solana. This article is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs Payments Week series.  Being colleagues at a decentralized finance (DeFi) startup, the latter seemed like the obvious choice. With the super-speed and low fees of Solana, it‚Äôd be easy, right? If neither of us cared about privacy, and the network was feeling cooperative that day, it could have been.  But here‚Äôs what the process looked like:  I opened my Solana wallet Phantom, generated a fresh address and sent it over via Discord. He logged into the crypto exchange FTX, exchanged some SOL for USDC and ‚Äúwithdrew‚Äù $0.01 to my address for the customary test transaction. FTX sent an email confirming that the withdrawal had been processed ‚Äì but 15 minutes later, I still hadn‚Äôt received anything.  Maybe the network was backed up? Who knows. We went home for the day.  The next day, my $0.01 had come through. Hurray! He sent the rest of the tokens, only to realize that he‚Äôd forgotten to account for the exchange rate between Singapore dollars and USD (128 SGD = ~96 USD). No problem ‚Äì I could just send back the extra to the same address, right? Wrong ‚Äì since he‚Äôd sent it through a centralized exchange, the receiving address would be different. Sigh.  By the time we got the payment sorted, the mouse ordered on Amazon had already arrived.  See also: Why Haven't Crypto Payments Taken Off?  We live in a golden age of capitalist convenience. Crypto is supposed to be the next frontier. So why are crypto payments so damn hard? And how might we make them better?  As an engineer-turned-designer, my answer is: human-centered design.  Human, first  If you haven‚Äôt heard of human-centered design, or HCD, it‚Äôs a simple concept: Observe the behaviors of your target users (aka real humans), learn what they need and design a product that caters to those needs.  In contrast, many crypto products embrace what one might call technology-centered design: Observe some underlying data and translate it directly as possible into the user interface. If data is stored as a table in the database, display it as a table in the UI, for example.  Often, the result of this tech-focused design process is an interface that contains all the necessary information, yet appears totally unfamiliar to first-time users.  So are we just talking about new interfaces? All new interfaces ‚Äì that‚Äôs innovation, right? Not quite. But alas, ‚Äúnew‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúbetter,‚Äù at least when it comes to design. Web 2 giants have spent years designing, developing and battle-testing the easiest ways to send money on the web. If we hope to invite the wider world into crypto, we must offer experiences that are at least as good as what‚Äôs already out there.  In many cases, that may mean black-boxing all the messy details that crypto apps leave naked for everyone to see.  Crypto‚Äôs messy details  Think of the last time you made a payment. Who were you paying? The first thing that comes to mind is likely a person or a business. It‚Äôs probably not a string of seemingly random letters and numbers.  And yet, crypto wallets and exchanges are largely address-centric. Sure, you can save someone‚Äôs address in most wallets, but that‚Äôs the same way my mom stored contacts back when all we had was a landline phone.  Web 2 solved this problem long ago through social profiles. In WeChat, I can pay a friend directly through the same interface we use to chat. No need to scan a QR code, trade a phone number or ask for any other identification. And yet, in Web 3, we‚Äôre stuck with the address book.  So, my controversial advice? Make Web 3 more like Web 2.  ‚ÄúBut no!‚Äù the crypto purists are sure to cry. For many, Web 3 means decentralization, which in turn represents freedom from the ever-watching eyes of giant social networks. By attempting to emulate the user experience of Web 2, wouldn‚Äôt we sacrifice those ideals?  Yes and no. In some cases, users will happily trade away some degree of anonymity in exchange for a better user experience, which is a trade they should feel empowered to make. In other cases, the tradeoff itself is a fallacy: An experience more like Web 2 can be achieved through decentralized means, such as the Ethereum Name Service. (Similarly, the tagline for the DeFi protocol I co-founded in 2021 Orca is ‚ÄúThe DEX for people, not programs.‚Äù)  For crypto payments to become mainstream, they must offer additional benefits without sacrificing good design.  See also: What Web 3 Can Learn From Steve Jobs | Opinion  In this sense, new approaches to on-chain payments seem promising. Published images of Solana Pay feature a familiar QR code-based payment interface. (Not my favorite payment UI ‚Äì tap-to-pay interfaces like Suica and payWave win that contest ‚Äì but at least there‚Äôs no guessing how to use it.)  The exact amount of payments and the identity of payers are not publicly viewable on the blockchain, offering a degree of the privacy users naturally expect from a payment platform.  Plus, it promises merchants lower fees and new approaches to build loyalty with customers through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, the protocol has not yet been tested at scale, and the reliability of the network is still a concern. For Solana Pay to succeed, these new features can‚Äôt come at the cost of the basics: security, reliability and simplicity.  The golden age of payments is already here.

Bitcoin Exchange Supply Shock Ratio Has Rapidly Risen Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there seem to be some similarities between the current market trend and that during the summer of 2020. The &apos;exchange supply&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin present on wallets of all exchanges. This supply is usually assumed to be the selling supply of the crypto as investors generally transfer their coins to exchanges for selling purposes. The supply in cold wallets of investors, on the other hand, is likely being held for accumulation, and is unlikely to be sold. The ratio between this investor wallet supply and the exchange reserve is called the &apos;exchange supply shock ratio.&apos; When the value of this metric goes up, it means the supply on exchanges is dropping and investors are filling up their cold wallets.

42407286,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSfi,1651171502,Bitcoin's Unfinished Business: Why Micropayments Still Matter,"One of the most important moments in the evolution of cryptocurrency was powerhouse investor Marc Andreessen‚Äôs landmark 2014 essay ‚ÄúWhy Bitcoin Matters.‚Äù This was the man who had seen the promise of transformational companies from Lyft and Facebook to Dollar Shave Club and Airbnb (and many others since), arguing in the pages of the New York Times that a technologically near-incomprehensible magic internet money had the same kind of potential.  Most of a decade later, Andreessen‚Äôs venture capital fund Andreessen-Horowitz is at the bleeding edge of cryptocurrency and web 3 investment. But looking back on that essay, it‚Äôs striking to note that one of the pillars of Andreessen‚Äôs Bitcoin thesis has definitively crumbled.  This article is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs Payments Week series.  ‚ÄúA third fascinating use case for Bitcoin is micropayments, or ultrasmall payments,‚Äù Andreessen wrote. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ It is not cost-effective to run small payments (think $1 and below, down to pennies or fractions of a penny) through the existing credit/debit and banking systems. The fee structure of those systems makes that nonviable. [But] all of a sudden, with Bitcoin, that‚Äôs trivially easy.‚Äù  Cue record scratch. You may be wondering how we got here.  The fee for a single transaction on Bitcoin in the Year of our Lord Two Thousand and Twenty-Two is nearly $2, according to BitInfo, making it not just extremely nonviable for sub-$1 payments, but also more expensive than a credit card even for many larger payments.  Fees have risen so dramatically because Bitcoin has a competitive market for transaction fees, which fund network security, and rising demand has made transactions more pricey. The last time Bitcoin fees were low enough for anything close to micropayments was June of 2015, when the cost of a simple send broke five cents. They haven‚Äôt looked back since. Even in the deep dark doldrums of the 2019 bear market, with the bitcoin (BTC) currency trading as low as $3,000, fees were consistently above 10 cents.  Andreessen wasn‚Äôt the only early crypto bull who hyped micropayments on Bitcoin but didn‚Äôt see the fee hike coming. The steady rise has contributed to the decline or shuttering of some early Bitcoin-based micropayments projects, such as ChangeTip.  But while it‚Äôs not going to happen on the Bitcoin base chain, fees low enough to support sub-dollar payments have remained both a technical Holy Grail and a common promotional refrain in crypto. Everything from less expensive proof-of-stake systems to Bitcoin‚Äôs own Lightning Network have hype-farmed the concept ¬≠‚Äì yet it remains, by and large, just a concept.  See also: The Lightning Network Is Bringing Payments Back to Bitcoin  And so we find ourselves asking: Can crypto, or any other technology, actually solve the problem of digital micropayments? What might that solution look like? And most importantly, what does the world stand to gain when it finally arrives?  Micropayments: An entirely different thing  There has been endless speculation about new business models that can be realized once digital micropayments are feasible. Much focus over the years has been on allowing users to buy media, such as individual news articles, on an ‚Äúa la carte‚Äù basis ‚Äì that is, piece by piece, rather than as part of a subscription or with intrusive advertising. The general argument is that this would allow a transition away from ad-supported content on the internet, which is still the thesis behind the Brave browser and its tokenized browsing model. But this and similar concepts may be barely the tip of the iceberg.  ‚ÄúPeople think about micropayments as smaller payments, but really you should think of them being an entirely different thing,‚Äù says Stefan Thomas, CEO of web-content micropayments platform Coil. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like if you thought of the internet as a fax machine that could send smaller faxes more cheaply. Instead, you can do entirely different forms of communication.‚Äù  Thomas, an early Bitcoin contributor, says much of his career has been defined by the quest for workable micropayments technology. It was part of his motivation for serving as chief technology officer of Ripple before forming Coil.  Micropayments are ‚Äúan entirely different thing‚Äù at least as much because of their consumer psychology as because of their business implications. Over the past five years, the discourse around micropayments has become much more attuned to the problem of ‚Äúmental transaction costs,‚Äù a concept developed in part by Bitcoin pioneer Nick Szabo way back in 1999.  The essence of the problem is that even if we solve the technical challenge of micropayments, users would find the decision to spend a dime or a nickel more annoying than the actual act. This would be a particular problem if micropayments were to become omnipresent on the Web, demanding that you make various small payments ten or 20 times a day.  An unintentionally hilarious illustration of the problem of mental transaction costs came recently during Meta/Facebook‚Äôs (FB) Metaverse launch video. Near the start of the presentation, while a group of folks are admiring a virtual sculpture, it starts to fade away. One of them has to ‚Äútip the artist‚Äù to look at the sculpture for more than a few minutes. There‚Äôs no clearer illustration that Meta‚Äôs pitch was aimed at investors rather than consumers, because a metaverse where you‚Äôre constantly micro-tipping artists would clearly be a gigantic pain in the ass. If micropayments make life worse for consumers in the way envisioned by Mark Zuckerberg, they‚Äôve obviously failed.  Melvin Klein, a researcher studying micropayment applications at the University of Hamburg, points out that there‚Äôs more than a bit of d√©j√† vu to this core problem. ‚ÄúWith America Online, people were annoyed by the ticking clock ‚Äì there‚Äôs another minute you have to pay for [being online]. People were so annoyed that in the end they had to transition to a monthly subscription.‚Äù  Read More: Bitcoin Payments Remain in Their Infancy But There Are Green Shoots Everywhere  That‚Äôs why Coil and several other projects have begun emphasizing what‚Äôs sometimes known as ‚Äústreaming micropayments.‚Äù Coil is effectively a membership subscription, but instead of one large publication or platform, it grants access to several smaller outlets. Those outlets then get paid in tiny streams as the user browses them.  Part of Coil‚Äôs tech stack are a pair of standards called Open Web Monetization and Interledger. The standards can interact with cryptocurrency networks, but also with other systems. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a layer on top of the blockchain,‚Äù Thomas says of Interledger. ‚ÄúEach transaction is extremely efficient. It really is free, and it really is infinitely scalable ‚Ä¶ [for] true micropayments. I wish more people were paying attention to the Interledger protocol.‚Äù  A project even more rooted in the crypto world is Superfluid, which CEO Francesco Renzi takes pains to emphasize is not really about ‚Äúmicropayments,‚Äù again because of the mental transaction cost issue. ‚ÄúFundamentally the way it works doesn‚Äôt require the user to understand that small payments are happening,‚Äù says Renzi. ‚ÄúThose small payments are more of a problem than they are a solution.‚Äú (Pro tip: Renzi says he often sees micropayments pitches at hackathons, and ‚Äúwe have to go and explain [to the developers] why it‚Äôs not a good idea.‚Äù)  Instead, Superfluid is a cryptocurrency standard for streaming payments. ‚ÄúStreaming is built into the token,‚Äù according to Renzi. ‚ÄúYou give me an address, I open a stream, every second your balance is ticking up.‚Äù So far, Renzi says Superfluid‚Äôs biggest market is decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) using it to pay contributors.  What‚Äôs most notable about Superfluid‚Äôs model is that the ‚Äústream‚Äù is a single transaction for the purpose of on-chain fees. ‚ÄúYou say, I want to send David a dollar every minute, and after that you‚Äôre done. You click the button once, you pay forever ‚Ä¶ Effectively, money itself is now moving on-chain automatically.‚Äù It also means that the longer a stream continues, the cheaper the relative transaction cost gets.  Machine-to-machine payments  But even if the streaming approach takes off, transactions between people may not wind up being the most interesting application for micropayments: Many argue the real potential lies in high-speed, machine-to-machine transactions. Examples include the sale of electricity from home solar installations, which has been explored by a crypto project called Brooklyn Microgrid, or streaming payments for electric vehicle charging. BitTorrent, now owned by Tron, has touted an automated micropayments system for download bandwidth which, at least in theory, can improve throughput for decentralized file sharing.  With micropayments added to digitized systems, ‚Äúeverything becomes more automatic,‚Äù according to Marvin Klein. For example, ‚ÄúYou can think about directly paying taxes when you buy a product, so the shop doesn‚Äôt have to do all the accounting.‚Äù  Read More: The Future of Crypto Payments Will Be Centralized  ‚ÄúAnother use case is artificial intelligence,‚Äù says Stefan Thomas. ‚ÄúSome people are thinking about a future where there‚Äôs a marketplace for internet user data. [But] you‚Äôre not going to think about selling this or that piece of data, there will be a user agent that does that on my behalf.‚Äù  Thomas also thinks micropayments could become key to building out modular and composable AI systems: ‚ÄúYou can plug into multiple APIs, but you need a payments system to pay them all.‚Äù  Micropayments and market control  A more familiar example of the transformational potential of micropayments is the Apple App Store ‚Äì not, that is, how micropayments could improve it, but how they could destroy it.  The App Store, you see, is the ultimate example of digital rent-seeking: an attempt to extract wealth out of other people‚Äôs creations by controlling a systemic chokepoint. It‚Äôs notorious for the 30% cut of sales Apple (AAPL)takes from app creators, and Apple‚Äôs ferocious opposition to allowing independent in-app purchases. Part of that rent is paid-for access to the iPhone ecosystem itself, which Apple has locked down to prevent users from installing programs from any source other than the App Store.  But payments technology plays a surprisingly large role in Apple‚Äôs ability to control the market. Many mobile apps, as you‚Äôve probably noticed, are priced at ninety-nine cents or less. This could be a big challenge from a payments perspective, since 10% or more of such small purchases would normally wind up with credit card or other payment processors.  Apple is able to work around the problem solely because of its centralization and scale. To save money on fees, the App Store bundles all of a customers‚Äô payments over the course of a month, according to Klein, then processes them in a batch. For instance, a purchase of two apps and a Coldplay album would be processed as a single transaction of $15, instead of three smaller transactions, cutting the processing fee as a percentage of the purchase substantially.  But even in a world where iOS was more open, a developer trying to sell a 99 cent app directly to users would not have access to this workaround. Since the vast majority of sales would be one-offs, there would be no option to reduce fees by bundling multiple payments from each customer.  This is just one example of how the absence of functional digital micropayments contributes to the clustering of digital commerce around a few players. Facebook, now known as Meta, apparently foresees that stranglehold continuing: it has said it will charge a cumulative 47.5% cut of digital creator sales in its Horizon Worlds environment.  Tip the artist, indeed ‚Äì but Zucky gets to wet his beak a little, eh?  A smarter market for a richer world  Finally, there is a more abstract problem that functional digital micropayments would solve: market transparency for low-priced digital goods.  One of the most important roles of markets in a society is to discover the level of demand for goods and, in turn, how much of that good an economy should produce. That‚Äôs complicated by the zero marginal cost nature of digital goods (once a piece of digital content is created, each additional copy is essentially free), but it still broadly holds when it comes to things like software development.  But the current structure of digital transaction fees creates a shocking blind spot in the market for digital goods that might be priced at under a dollar. That could range from trivialities like video game skins and novelty non-fungible tokens (NFT) to more impactful products like niche applications or highly tailored data streams. It could also include real-world services like on-the-go cell phone charging.  Read More: Fast, Fluid, Frictionless Payments Are the Future  But the entire category remains underdeveloped because payments limitations have proportionally higher influence over pricing than actual consumer demand does. In effect, any digital good that would be appropriately priced at less than a dollar must either be sold through an intermediary, priced above market equilibrium in a way that makes it less likely to succeed, or, probably most often, simply not produced at all.  Cell phone charging is a great example. Right now, paid cell-charging services are largely limited to airports, where rushed, higher-income flyers are willing to pay far above the actual cost of a charge. But if payments tech made it possible to charge a more appropriate a la carte price for charging (probably just a few cents per hour including a healthy profit margin), intuition suggests charging services would be much more widely available. It‚Äôs a market failure caused entirely by the lack of functional micropayments.  There are likely many similar potential examples ‚Äì including many we can‚Äôt even imagine. But right now, it‚Äôs near-impossible to sell such goods outside of a relatively limited set of siloed, heavily intermediated markets. Most likely, this means there is immense unfulfilled demand for low-cost digital goods, data distribution, mobile charging, and other services that the market is currently fulfilling.  That‚Äôs an economic inefficiency that will only grow as the economy digitizes ‚Äì unless widespread and functional micropayments free the market from its technological constraints.

42421637,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXojID,1651170665,How Western Sanctions on Russia Could Make Crypto an International Reserve Currency,"Western powers have imposed unprecedented financial sanctions in response to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, marking a seismic geopolitical shift that could drive many countries to adopt crypto.  In the modern era, international payments and national reserves have generally been viewed as state property and omitted from punitive sanctions when the U.S. was not itself at war.  Mark Lurie is CEO and co-founder of Shipyard Software, a crypto trading software provider. Peter Dittus is former secretary general of the Bank for International Settlements and an economist.  But what has happened in recent weeks has remade the landscape. By imposing unprecedented sanctions, freezing Russia‚Äôs foreign currency reserves and halting international payments from Russian banks, the U.S., EU and their allies have revealed a newfound willingness to weaponize the dollar-denominated global financial system and potentially leave the world‚Äôs smaller states out to dry.  To explain how, let‚Äôs first take a step back. The Belgium-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, is the primary global messaging network for executing transactions between the world‚Äôs banks. The system is so effective that many countries also use it domestically, which is why SWIFT sees more than 42 million messages per day.  Any currency can be traded via SWIFT, but more than 40% of its deals are dollar-denominated, so it tends to reinforce the U.S. dollar-based system. It should be no surprise, then, that in 2015, China launched a SWIFT competitor, the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), to boost international use of the yuan.  Read More: EU 'Commits' to Cutting Russian Banks Off From SWIFT Over Ukraine Invasion  As a U.S. trade war flared during the Trump era, Beijing linked international investments involving its 70-nation, $1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative to a commitment to use CIPS. Last year, while just 3% of SWIFT payments involved yuan, the number of CIPS transactions increased nearly 60% and the value of CIPS transactions increased more than 80%, to 64 trillion yuan.  In 2017, Russia launched its own SWIFT competitor, the System for Transfer of Financial Messages, or SPFS. It‚Äôs been less widely embraced due to higher transaction costs and because Russia‚Äôs economy is one-tenth that of China's. But since the imposition of Western sanctions, Moscow has heavily promoted SPFS use to key trade partners that are also Western allies, such as India, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. And Moscow‚Äôs leverage comes from its oil and gas exports.  Payment in rubles  The international oil and gas market is worth nearly $6 trillion, or 7% of global GDP, which is why nearly every domestic economy responds so sharply to shifts in the price of crude oil. Since a deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia in the 1970s ‚Äì an agreement that gave us the term ‚Äúpetrodollars‚Äù ‚Äì oil and gas have been priced and quoted exclusively in U.S. dollars.  But that may soon change. Russia has pressured European importers of its oil and gas to pay in rubles. While Germany and others have declined, Hungary agreed. China has for years been seeking to buy oil in yuan, and last month The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia is seriously considering the proposal. This would represent the greatest challenge thus far to the dollar-denominated global system.  Also last month, Moscow announced that Russia and China had agreed to connect CIPS and SPFS, and suggested that its transactions would also begin to incorporate digital rubles and yuan. India has also reportedly committed to establishing a new system with Russia.  It doesn‚Äôt take Nostradamus to see what‚Äôs taking shape. Once major players like Russia, China and India align, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before smaller countries are pressured to fall in line. The end result will be a bifurcated international financial system, SWIFT versus non-SWIFT.  It‚Äôs also easy to see how smaller, less powerful states would be interested in a third option ‚Äì a neutral reserve currency and payment system that‚Äôs immune to weaponization. Suddenly they would no longer be at the financial mercy of global powers.  Crypto as an alternative monetary system  How might we get there? One possible route is pricing. Businesses prefer to denominate their goods in the same currency they use to pay expenses, which tends to be the currency of the country in which they are based. A U.S. airline, for instance, will price its tickets in USD ‚Äì not because it views the dollar as the most stable currency, though it may, but because it has agreed to pay salaries and fuel costs in U.S. dollars.  Read More: America's Quiet Default  But what about the Kyoto-based businessman, you may wonder, who buys his U.S. airline tickets online in yen? No matter which currency the buyer uses, the goods or service has been denominated in the currency chosen by the business; its value is thus pegged to the U.S. dollar.  This is precisely why businesses dislike committing to buy overseas goods in a foreign currency, because they must then take on the fluctuation risk of that currency. Many end up buying complex financial instruments like futures and swaps to limit this risk. For businesses to start pricing in Bitcoin, their costs will need to be denominated in the same currency.  El Salvador plunged in last year and adopted bitcoin as legal tender. Last month Ukraine made Bitcoin and a handful of other currencies acceptable currency for payments. The tipping point may be a major gas exporter, like Venezuela or Qatar, similarly adopting cryptocurrency and pricing some oil exports in bitcoin. Once oil and gas can be denominated in cryptocurrency, we‚Äôre likely to see businesses start pegging their goods and services to crypto.  Now, as countries begin to grasp that aligning with either the dollar-based system or the Sino-Russian system leaves them exposed to geopolitical winds, the pressure is building. For the moment, dollar dominance isn‚Äôt so bad. Making payments is instantaneous, and replacing these systems with stablecoins or some sort of central bank digital currency (CBDC) tomorrow would likely only offer almost imperceptible improvements.  Most would wonder why the switch had been made at all. Only when goods and services are denominated in crypto will it be worthwhile for consumers to shift away from dollarized payments. After that, global economic players will begin to view crypto as a viable unit of account for goods and services, and perhaps for everyday payments as well.  For smaller countries looking to preserve their financial sovereignty and avoid geopolitical fallout, that day, when cryptocurrencies emerge as a viable solution, could mark a new dawn.

But even though this old adage has long been an unavoidable reality for digital creatives, emerging Web 3 technologies are finally disrupting this broken revenue model and putting consumers in the driver‚Äôs seat. These next-gen content sharing platforms are using crypto to reward creators and their fans for their engagement and create new ways to directly connect with one another.  Let‚Äôs take a step back. In 2006, the world witnessed one of the first viral social media videos, ‚ÄúEvolution of Dance,‚Äù on YouTube, and the internet was never the same. Since then, society has been transformed by the mass adoption of media platforms like Twitter, TikTok and Instagram. Digital creators ‚Äì the artists, musicians, gamers and influencers who have become celebrities in their own right ‚Äì are power users that have collectively enabled the success of social media.  James Kuk is CEO of FreshCut. This article is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs Payments Week series.  But Big Tech companies have taken advantage of the very creators that drive so much revenue, value and demand for their platforms ‚Äì turning creators into products.Web 2 platforms further omit or limit monetization features that would compensate high-performing creators.  That‚Äôs not to say some social media ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù haven‚Äôt made money. Likes and views may not pay the bills, but brands recognize the value of exposure to engaged audiences and greatly increased online advertising spend, hence the #sponsored content that rules our feeds.  The inability for creators to be natively rewarded by platforms for high quality, entertaining content has forced a synergy between artists and brands that need not exist. Sure, these content platforms pay lip service to their users and make incremental changes that provide small concessions to the creators they feed off of. But at the end of the day their core business model is exploitative and based on third-party advertising, jammed between creators and viewers in endless, self-serving iterations.  See also: Don't Let Web 3 Repeat Web 2's Mistakes | Opinion  Crypto payments  This is all changing. A new generation of Web 3 content platforms is rewarding their users‚Äô creativity and engagement via crypto assets that are used both for communal governance and as a form of social currency. The fact that these crypto-based platforms involve minimal service fees and other commercial middlemen means they are increasingly adopted for online payments ‚Äì in addition to being used by creators to spin up new offerings and engagement opportunities.  Crypto and the blockchain enables new revenue streams for creators. NFTs, for instance, have opened a new paradigm of creative financing in the form of perpetual and automated royalties. In the future, we might also see innovations around tipping or micropayments ‚Äì a field that hasn‚Äôt exactly taken off. The existing Web 2 models work ‚Äì like Patreon or Kickstarter ‚Äì but they also take a significant percentage of fan patronage (sometimes siphoning off half of the revenue creators generate).  Perhaps most importantly, with these systems more value will go to the individual users helping power the underlying network, rather than a centralized enterprise. Said another way, the rising tide of Web 3 social media and content sharing platforms helps content creators get more and better value for their time and effort.  Web 3 woes  But it‚Äôs important to realize that amidst the legitimate Web 3 platforms disrupting the social media value paradigm, there are opportunists out there disguising themselves as allies to the cause in order to turn a profit.  Take Meta (nee Facebook). Meta is testing a new tool that will allow creators to sell virtual products in Horizon, their new metaverse platform. But creators will have to hand over up to 47.5% of their revenue to Meta and Oracle for every sale they make. A Meta executive claimed that the company's fees were set at a pretty competitive rate ‚Äì but that‚Äôs exactly the point! Unfair revenue sharing models are standard across the major tech platforms today ‚Äì even the ones that are trying to reposition themselves as creator friendly.  Much has already been said about how Meta‚Äôs centralized operations and profit-driven ethos are incompatible with the budding Web 3 industry ‚Äì but this story drives home the fact that companies like Facebook will not be the future of content sharing, no matter how many rebrands they undergo.  Community-centric, user-focused online platforms will continue to take power away from traditional tech giants, creating a virtuous cycle as fans contribute directly to creators‚Äô growth and creators receive immediate and direct feedback from their followers. The current ad model is predicated on the need for centralized entities that can divide and conquer the communities they rely on, but next-gen content platforms are using crypto to redistribute more value back to content creators.

According to data from crypto analytics site Dune, Coinbase‚Äôs marketplace had less than 900 total transactions since its launch on April 20. (The data is routed through 0x Project, which Coinbase tapped for the marketplace‚Äôs back end.)  Total trade volume on the marketplace in that time has been 73 ETH (roughly $217,000), with around 650 users so far transacting on the platform.  The low usage stats can likely be attributed to the fact that Coinbase has only granted a small portion of its three-million person waitlist access to the platform. In an emailed statement to CoinDesk, Coinbase said it would not be able to confirm any user data on its NFT marketplace because the product is in beta.  For comparison purposes, established NFT marketplace OpenSea did over $808 million in Ethereum-based trade volume during that same period, amongst over 36,000 users.  Coinbase has said its social-focused marketplace is still in its early stages of development, with plans to drive more users to the platform with exclusive partnerships to be announced in the coming months.

While analysts expected gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 1% in the first quarter of 2022, it declined by 1.4% instead, according to the report released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Because cryptocurrency prices have recently started to move in correlation with equity markets, a slowdown in economic growth, which might signal an upcoming recession, could affect digital assets including bitcoin (BTC).  Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market didn‚Äôt move much after the report was released.  ‚ÄúThe lack of an overreaction in markets reflects the underlying details of the report not being as bad as the headline suggests,‚Äù Danielle Booth, CEO of Quill Intelligence, a Dallas, Texas-based economic intelligence firm.

The commonly used definition of a recession is a decline in economic activity over two consecutive quarters, so it remains to be seen if this first quarter of the year is worrisome or not.  Some major banks, including Deutsche Bank and Bank of America, say the U.S. economy could fall into a recession as soon as 2023.  ‚ÄúMomentum headed into the second quarter is not robust enough to suggest this negative print was a 'one and done,'‚Äù Booth said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/28/us-economy-shrinks-unexpectedly-amplifying-recession-fears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d84c5963fd35acaed67865719708ca2235b3df7-996x912.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421172,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd53t,1651163537,Jaime Rogozinski: Why WallStreetBets Took Off,"The man who founded WallStreetBets, Jaime Rogozinski, didn‚Äôt love trading stocks. At least not at first. In the mid-2000s, as a side hustle, Rogozinski could afford to plunk around $1,000 in shares of Google. It cost him a $30 commission to buy and a $30 commission to sell, meaning that fees gobbled up 6% of the trade. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like, wow, this sucks,‚Äù says Rogozinski. ‚ÄúClearly, it works if you have a ton of money but it doesn‚Äôt work if you have $1,000 bucks.‚Äù  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  So he toyed with different trading strategies. A sample trade: In a low-probability bet, Rogozinski might go short on Microsoft (MSFT), risking $100 in the hopes of winning $1,000. These usually lost. But one day he shorted Microsoft, went to lunch, came back to his desk and saw that he won $2,000. ‚ÄúI was like, Oh [crap], I made a lot of money. What the hell?‚Äù It turns out that somebody had hacked the Twitter account for the Associated Press and sent out a false news story (literally fake news) that then-President Barack Obama was bombed in the White House. The markets tanked. Rogozinski‚Äôs Microsoft short ‚Äì by pure chance ‚Äì was a home run.  ‚ÄúHoly crap,‚Äù he thought at the time. Suddenly, his perspective changed. The traditional way of looking at stocks by ‚Äúfundamentals‚Äù (such as profits and costs and revenue) seemed far less important ‚Äì at least in the short term ‚Äì than random events like a Twitter hack. How could he exploit this insight?  Rogozinski tried to find an online community where people talked about this kind of stuff. He couldn‚Äôt find one. So he went to Reddit and created WallStreetBets, choosing a name that acknowledged and even celebrated the risk. He was sick of everyone saying Wall Street is just like a casino and you shouldn‚Äôt trade stocks because it‚Äôs just like gambling. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go ahead and call it what it is,‚Äù Rogozinski says. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs wear that on our sleeves.‚Äù The very name, in a sense, inoculates the forum: The aggressive risk is right there in the title. Caveat emptor.  Enter the era of ‚Äúyolo trades,‚Äù trash talking and eventually, of course, the wild frenzy of GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) and a retail trading army that would cost hedge funds $1 billion a day. ‚ÄúIt was a screwed-up system,‚Äù says Rogozinski, who viewed the forum as a way to stick up for the little guy.  Rogozinski left WallStreetBets in 2020 after a spat with moderators from spin-off chat rooms (‚Äúthere were a handful of mods who were straight up white supremacists,‚Äù he told the Wall Street Journal), but now, from his home in Mexico City ‚Äì where he lives with his wife and two young kids ‚Äì he‚Äôs still railing against the machine. Rogozinski created a cheeky new fund to mimic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs investments. He envisions creating a massive in-stadium event for the ‚ÄúeSports of day trading.‚Äù He happily doles out advice for newbie traders (‚Äúgo out there and lose money‚Äù). And he explains why, even though he doesn‚Äôt use it for trading, ‚ÄúI keep my money in crypto.‚Äù  This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Let‚Äôs start with the early days. Why do you think WallStreetBets took off?  It turns out tons of people were in the same shoes that I was. A mindset of, ‚ÄúHey, I got a job. I can take risks. Let's learn how to make money."" And it created an outlet for the professional traders who had no outlet. They could come and literally just have fun and hang out.  These guys have cracked the market, to some extent, but they're still staring at their screen all day long and they're bored, and it's lonely. I then came to learn that if you're having fun while trading professionally, you're not doing it right. It's not meant to be fun.  Wait, I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre joking or being serious? So trading shouldn‚Äôt be fun? Is the idea that you should be methodical like a robot, saying, ‚ÄúHere are my rules. Here are my parameters. Execute. Buy. Sell.‚Äù  That's exactly right. And all the people that fail typically fail not because of their game plan, but because of their inability to execute on that game plan. They'll change the game plan halfway through, for whatever reason, and emotions get in the way.  Advice for new traders?  Go out there and lose money. Like, go out there and trade. Just do stuff, click it. Don't worry about it. One of the things you‚Äôre going to learn is how to insulate yourself from the emotions. And sometimes the emotions of making a lot of money is just as, if not more, dangerous than losing money.  How so?  A lot of people ‚Äì including myself, when I started ‚Äì kind of get this high, right? Like you‚Äôre the king of the world. You win so much money that now you can afford to take more risk. You think, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the house's money,‚Äù so you start getting reckless and you start chipping away at those profits.  And even if you just chip away at the profits, that's already bad because you‚Äôre screwing with your financial model. [The model depends on the profits of the winners offsetting the losses of the losers, so if you lose that profit the model no longer works.] Or in the worst-case scenario, you end up going on tilt. You just go crazy and you get desperate and you lose it all. So now you took your big win and wasted it, which means now you need to go and play catch-up, which is a really bad cycle.  The very name, in a sense, inoculates the forum: the aggressive risk is right there in the title.  What were some of the early trading strategies in the forum?  There was a news trader who would pay $20,000 a month to have, like, the newswire come to him before it actually appears in the news. And he had a bracelet that would alert him. So he'd run to his computer when there was breaking news, and he‚Äôd have 10 seconds to place some crazy trade. And he would just make stupid amounts of money. Occasionally, he‚Äôd put this little bot in our chat room so that we could see him. But it‚Äôs not as easy as it looks because having the news beforehand still requires a lot of thinking at break-neck speed.  What‚Äôs your trading like now? I know you can‚Äôt spill your secrets, but how would you describe your style, in general terms?  I don't have some super crazy secret to this thing. But the genre is technical analysis. I look at charts. I look at the prices. And occasionally, I'll draw a line and there. But I've learned to read the market based off of technical analysis.  What stocks or instruments do you trade?  Almost always I do it with Nasdaq futures. Sometimes I'll do SPY [the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund], but Nasdaq's a bit more volatile. And then, where there's money-making opportunities, I‚Äôll trade with gold or with oil. And I dabble in [foreign exchange]. Forex is fun.  Got it. What can you tell us about your idea for an ‚ÄúeSports‚Äù version of trading?  It was this thing where I would rent out a stadium, and fill the stadium with people. And I'll have 10 contestants with computers. And we'll have traders like a Dave Portnoy [founder of Barstool Sports] and a Jim Cramer and a Morgan Stanley (MS) trader ‚Äì and people from all walks of life and experience, and have a three-day ‚Äútrade-off‚Äù with real money, live on the actual stock market.  It‚Äôd be a competition, where I‚Äôd pay the winner, like, a million-dollar prize. I‚Äôm giving them incentive for risk, which means you can get action, like with the World Series of Poker. This is high-stakes gambling in the stock market.  How does this not exist?!  At one point, I wanted to do it in Las Vegas. And you would have teams and competitions, like a sports event. And this is how you elicit change [to the financial trading systems]. It‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing this because we can. And if you don‚Äôt like it, then fix it.‚Äù  That has always been my approach to Wall Street. It‚Äôs a screwed-up system. For years I was like, ‚ÄúThis should be a really serious thing because it helps capitalism grow and companies can raise funds.‚Äù But it's gotten so far away from that. Let‚Äôs rein it back in by pushing it as extreme as we can, right? And then, people will have to change it.  What happened with the eSports thing?  By 2020, eventually I did get sponsors. And then the [whole] world closes down and coronavirus. But I‚Äôve never let go of that dream. I‚Äôm going to do it. In fact, this is the reason why I wrote the book. [‚ÄúWallStreetBets: How Boomers Made the World‚Äôs Biggest Casino for Millennials‚Äù]  I sucked at English class. Writing was not my thing. But I was so determined to make this thing [the esports tournament] happen that I‚Äôm like, what are the steps for me to accomplish this? And one of the steps was, ‚ÄúI need to present myself as the one that created WallStreetBets.‚Äù And I needed to present myself as a serious intellectual, not this clown that's doing these crazy things. I wanted to be a thought leader, someone serious. How do you do that? And I realize, you have to write a book. And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh ..., all right.‚Äù  I have to say, a live, stadium-filled showcase of traders going head to head ‚Ä¶ as a trading nerd, I‚Äôd watch that.  I've never actually seen people trading live like that. And I've lived this for over a decade. And I've never had the opportunity to witness a trader either making or losing tons of money, in front of me, and see what he‚Äôs clicking on. Like, is he alt-tabbing to Twitter? Or is he just staring at stocks?  Where does crypto fit into your trading or investing?  Look, I keep my money in crypto. It‚Äôs easier to store money there. Moving money from the U.S. to Mexico is very difficult, but using crypto is really easy. I've had so many challenges with using banks with a lot of these things that I try to do, especially internationally. There are things I can do in two seconds with crypto. So it‚Äôs nicely diversified in a portfolio that I don‚Äôt feel like touching, ever.  So you‚Äôre bullish on crypto?  I own a lot of crypto but not because I'm bullish, but because it's more convenient to have my money there. My anticipation is that it [bitcoin] will go up, but I don't care how long it takes. And I also own a lot of crypto because I‚Äôm doing a ton of learning, like, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean you can make 8,000% API with staking a liquidity pool token? It's like, what the [heck] does that mean?""  Give us some predictions, for both crypto and Wall Street?  I'm hoping that crypto infects Wall Street such that you will have a lot of things on Wall Street that are borrowed from crypto.  People will occasionally make millions. Most of them will lose, and some of them will bounce around.  Such as?  These smart contracts that use variable ETFs, that have the ability to mix and match things on the fly. You now have [crypto] instruments that previously would take a lot of time, effort, and money to create. And you can create them on-the-fly for a wide range of really interesting financial uses.  Another prediction is that the lines [between Wall Street and crypto] will continue to get blurry. It‚Äôs not going to be, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a crypto person and I‚Äôm a stock person.‚Äù When you go into your Robinhood (HOOD) account, you can buy dogecoin (DOGE) just as easily as you can buy whatever. And soon enough, you‚Äôd be able to open your Coinbase (COIN) and buy Apple (AAPL).  How about predictions for retail trading?  I see the retail ‚Äì and the younger generation ‚Äì continuing to have fun, continuing to make and break money. I've never pretended that the average retail person is profitable. And I don't think I ever will. I think most people go through a very similar journey to the one that I've gone through, with deviations to it. People will occasionally make millions.

42421638,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXojPR,1651163220,Mark Zuckerberg to Investors: Expect Nothing From the Metaverse,"The company formerly known as Facebook is already signaling investors not to hope for much actual revenue from its metaverse project for the foreseeable future, even though the entire entity was rebranded to Meta (FB) less than nine months ago. In Meta‚Äôs latest quarterly earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested it could be roughly seven to 10 years before the company‚Äôs investments in building immersive virtual worlds produce any net revenue. That timeline, for many serious investors, is the functional equivalent of ‚Äúnever.‚Äù  The lengthy roadmap is a reminder that while Facebook pitched its pivot to Meta as a serious long-term plan, that wasn't the whole truth. In hindsight, Meta‚Äôs pivot looked at least as much like a panicked, half-cocked scramble to distract from a storm of public criticism about Facebook‚Äôs social impacts. Meta‚Äôs almost casual messaging about revenue expectations from its new namesake concept stands in stark contrast to blockchain-based metaverses like Decentraland, which if nothing else seem to actually care about succeeding.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  At Facebook/Meta, though, Wednesday‚Äôs call made clear the metaverse is little more than a public relations tool.  The most pointed moment came when Zuckerberg was asked for a timeline for actual returns from the Reality Labs segment of the company, which houses virtual reality (VR) hardware maker Oculus and the virtual space Horizon Worlds.  ‚ÄúI expect this to be later this decade,‚Äù said Zuckerberg of the timeline for metaverse adoption. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ This is laying the groundwork for a very successful 2030s, when this is more established as the primary computing platform.‚Äù  This is an absolutely harebrained thing for the CEO of a massive corporation to say about its supposed marquee project. I have a friend who runs money for a major pension fund, and he once told me something very basic and obvious, but crucial: Serious institutional investors don‚Äôt make bets more than five years into the future, and usually no more than two. Big banks and major Wall Street funds have seen it all before, and they‚Äôve learned that beyond a certain point you genuinely can‚Äôt predict the future. They care about what your revenue is going to look like six months or a year from now, not a decade hence.  Of course, angel investors and seed-round venture capitalists love to take small, multi-year, longshot bets, and big companies like Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) have R&D divisions developing unprofitable but forward-looking ‚Äúother bets.‚Äù But Google never renamed itself ‚ÄúProject Loon,‚Äù because banks and other behemoths that deal in much bigger numbers want a lot more certainty than an R&D longshot can provide. So when Zuckerberg says, ‚Äúthis will take 10 years,‚Äù what serious investors hear is, ‚Äúthis is a complete gamble and maybe not real at all and we had no substantive reason to rebrand around it. Ignore it.‚Äù  See also: Facebook Steals Another Crypto Idea | Opinion  Zuckerberg seemed to pump the brakes on metaverse expectations again later in the call in response to a similar question: ‚ÄúI think that the cycle here between investment and meaningful enough revenue growth to be near or very profitable [for metaverse projects] is going to be long. I think it's going to be longer for Reality Labs than for a lot of the traditional software that we've built.‚Äù  Instead, the call heavily featured Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg drilling down into the minutiae of new and upcoming advertising products across ‚Ä¶ Well, they mostly talked about Instagram and Reels, two good but hardly game-changing products at this point.  Meta is ultimately a media company reliant on advertising, and nothing more. The emphasis on Sandberg‚Äôs dry-as-dust advertising pitch clearly showed a genuine desire to shore up investor confidence in actually existing products, in the face of new ad sales challenges from iOS data-sharing changes and the loss of users from Russia.  There were other, subtler hints of internal ambivalence towards metaverse and Reality Labs projects. There was a lot of talk on the call about slowing spending, a sensible reaction to uneven sales and user growth for Meta‚Äôs actual products. Zuckerberg specifically noted that ‚Äúwe are now planning to slow the pace of some of our investments‚Äù ‚Äì that is, internal spending on long-term projects ‚Äì in a group of projects including Reality Labs.  But when an AB Bernstein analyst later asked about investment levels in metaverse projects specifically, Zuckerberg seemed to dodge the question. ‚ÄúWe're shifting the bulk of the energy inside the company toward those high-priority areas, away from other areas,‚Äù Zuckerberg said ‚Äì without specifying whether the metaverse is a high priority. Based on the call‚Äôs substantive focus on driving Instagram ad revenue, it sure doesn‚Äôt seem to be.  Reality Labs expenses grew 55% to $3.7 billion in Q1, which suggests real commitment, but Zuckerberg‚Äôs talk of reducing investment was phrased in forward-looking terms, so that‚Äôs not necessarily the case. Some clearer first-quarter data should be available in regulatory filings soon, but what executives say in a public call is at least as worthy of scrutiny as the actual numbers. It‚Äôs a safe bet that Meta‚Äôs communications team is larger than CoinDesk‚Äôs entire staff, and they‚Äôve surely gone to unbelievable lengths to massage this messaging ‚Äì but sometimes that just makes it easier to spot the sculptor‚Äôs hand.  And here‚Äôs the real head-scratcher: If the metaverse is such a long-term project that Meta‚Äôs CEO and founder is downplaying its prospects in an earnings call, why was there such a media blitz around the company rebrand and the big new metaverse quest in the first place?  See also: Web 3 and the Metaverse Are Not the Same | Opinion  You‚Äôre not supposed to remember, but the Meta pivot immediately followed a wave of negative press for Facebook in early and mid 2021. In fact, Facebook announced its rebrand to Meta just weeks after former Facebook data scientist Frances Haugen broke ranks to disclose the company had, among other troubling practices, ignored its own research about the ways its products harm children.  Rather than continue to weather that storm, Facebook announced that it was now ‚Äúa metaverse company.‚Äù Yay! That served a dual purpose, with a certain subset of investors wowed by the big new thing and critics like me having a field day gleefully tearing it to shreds.  It was clear from Wednesday‚Äôs call that the distraction has worked. There was not one question about content moderation on Meta platforms. That‚Äôs a huge win, particularly because there‚Äôs little evidence the company has actually solved the problem. It doesn‚Äôt matter if Horizon Worlds ever catches on, or if the metaverse behind Meta ever fully comes to fruition ‚Äì for the former Facebook it might be worth a few billion dollars just to change the channel.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MANA | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,David Z.

While only toncoin (TON) can be sent within the app, users can also buy bitcoin (BTC) through the ""@wallet"" bot.  The aim is to make sending toncoin ""feel like sending a text message,"" the TON Foundation, the steward of the cryptocurrency project, said Thursday. The bot has been used by 800,000 Telegram accounts already, it said.  ""We anticipate that this functionality will extend into consumer to business payments, so that people can easily acquire goods and services by sending toncoin via bots in the Telegram app,"" the foundation said.

42407284,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSZ6,1651160519,Bitcoin Payments Remain in Their Infancy but There Are Green Shoots Everywhere,"The good news, for anyone who was hoping for mass adoption of bitcoin (BTC): There's a viable retail use case for the cryptocurrency.  The perhaps more sobering news: That use case is as a reward for spending dollars, not a currency to be spent itself.  Iconic burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK) ran a promotion last month where customers were able to receive bitcoin as a reward for purchases made using Block‚Äôs (SQ) Cash App. ‚ÄúWe've found that, on average, users that receive bitcoin boosts spend more per transaction and overall spend more at Shake Shack,‚Äù Julia Webb, the company‚Äôs director of digital marketing, told CoinDesk.  This article is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs Payments Week series.  ‚ÄúWhile we successfully reached a new, valuable audience with this promotion, our goal moving forward is to understand how to scale this and similar programs to a broader audience and encourage frequency,‚Äù she added.  That qualified success speaks to the challenges bitcoin and its various knockoffs and descendants face at the checkout counter. While early evangelists framed bitcoin as a digital currency that would replace fiat, many today hold it either as a gold-like, inflation-resistant store of value or as a speculative investment. Many vow to stay away from it altogether.  Whatever your stance, crypto as a form of payment remains in the early innings, a tantalizing vision that hasn't come to fruition just yet.That said, new advances in the crypto payments niche are occurring daily. Emphasis on niche.  Having said that, developments in the crypto payments space are occurring daily, and they‚Äôre relevant for everyone from consumers to central bankers.  Transaction speed and costs, regulation and price volatility are common roadblocks to bitcoin being widely accepted as a payment method. On the other hand, prominent examples shed light on the potential of cryptocurrencies, with the most recent one being the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.  Crypto payments in digital consumer-to-business merchant commerce (including e-commerce) remains relatively small, representing about $6 billion of annual volume, according to a white paper from payments company Nuvei. This figure is minor compared to Nuvei‚Äôs estimate of the over $10 trillion market for total B2C ecommerce. About 15%-25% of crypto‚Äôs roughly 300 million global users are using crypto for merchant payments, Nuvei added.  In crypto‚Äôs early days, many physical retailers announced they were going to accept digital currency, only to shutter their plans. ‚ÄúPhysical store acceptance of crypto is more important to monitor, as over 85% of sales in the U.S. occur in stores rather than online,‚Äù Morgan Stanley‚Äôs (MS) cryptocurrency analyst Sheena Shah told clients in a note, adding that only eight of the top 500 retailers currently accept bitcoin.  Across the U.S., consumer businesses are slowly continuing to test the waters for bitcoin payments. Take that Shake Shack promotion last month where customers received bitcoin as a reward for purchases when using Block‚Äôs Cash App. The company wants to do more of these initiatives in future.  ‚ÄúSince we launched the bitcoin rewards program with Cash App, we've found that on average, users that receive Bitcoin Boosts spend more per transaction and overall spend more at Shake Shack,‚Äù says Webb. ‚ÄúWhile we successfully reached a new, valuable audience with this promotion, our goal moving forward is to understand how to scale this and similar programs to a broader audience and encourage frequency.‚Äù  Meanwhile, the Lightning Network ‚Äì a layer 2 protocol designed for scalability and faster payments ‚Äì has allowed bitcoin payment bulls to argue that broader adoption is coming. Until now, although bitcoin was originally slated as a form of peer-to-peer digital cash, Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs vision for bitcoin may have paved the way for other cryptos to become more viable payment methods.  Read More: Crypto Becomes Lifeline for Russian Emigr√©s Opposing Putin‚Äôs War in Ukraine  Payment green shoots via stablecoins and CBDCs?  Use cases for bitcoin continue to pop up, though many in the industry see stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) gaining traction more readily.  ‚ÄúStablecoins are going to be one of the dominant payment rails for commerce online and offline,‚Äù says Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital asset group at investment firm Ninepoint Partners. Tapscott highlighted how individuals own and control their stablecoins, versus cash in a bank account that is merely a representation of real value.  Unbanked jurisdictions and special situations like the Russia-Ukraine conflict are lending credence to bitcoin‚Äôs use case. However, the ‚Äúbigger picture is that crypto is eating payments,‚Äù with bitcoin still part of the conversation, Tapscott added.  Nuvei sees a strong future for non-fungible token (NFT) payments (see below) and stablecoins. ‚ÄúMany of our clients are interested in getting their funds much faster,‚Äù Yuval Ziv, Nuvei‚Äôs president, said.  ‚ÄúIt is easy to see the natural tension between cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and CBDCs. However, we (and others) anticipate a future where CBDCs co-exist with both cryptocurrencies and stablecoins along with traditional fiat,‚Äù Nuvei added in its white paper.  Just last week, payments processor Stripe said it‚Äôs letting clients settle payments in Circle‚Äôs USDC. Twitter (TWTR) is planning a pilot for content creators on ‚ÄúTicketed Spaces‚Äù and ‚ÄúSuper Follows.‚Äù to be paid in crypto.  The largest payments companies including Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) began trials with USDC last year.  Read More: PayPal‚Äôs Blockchain Chief on the Future of Crypto in Payments  More adoption  Delivering on crypto payments technology and usage will continue to hinge on safety for users along with scalability. That‚Äôs what motivates Mastercard and what will ultimately let merchants and consumers come onboard.  ‚ÄúWe're not here to pick winners‚Äù in regards to which cryptocurrency will come out on top as a payment method, Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard‚Äôs global head of crypto and blockchain, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúWe want to make sure that the consumer and merchants have a choice in what they do.‚Äù  Enabling crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto flows is key for billions of global consumers to get involved, without proper trust in the system, adoption will face headwinds, Dhamodharan says.  NFT payments  Many see NFTs as a great intersection for crypto payments and the digital asset economy. Whether it be digital media or gaming, users may prefer digital currencies to transact.  The crypto industry is asking a key question: Will NFTs ‚Äúbecome so popular that they help to onboard new people to Bitcoin and ether as a payment tool?‚Äù according to Tapscott. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where we‚Äôre headed,‚Äù he says.  Read More: The Lightning Network Is Bringing Payments Back to Bitcoin  As per gamers, a large demographic in the current NFT ecosystem, NFTs will allow them to ‚Äútruly own their digital personas and goods, rather than simply having a limited claim from a publisher,‚Äù Nuvei said. Cryptos including bitcoin are also increasingly being used by game publishers to reward gamers and aid the exchange of value within gaming ecosystems, the company added.  Perhaps not for crypto maximalists, larger NFT companies such as OpenSea, through MoonPay, opened up their payment rails to traditional credit card holders in the event a customer wants to buy an NFT and have their fiat converted to crypto. Additionally, U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) teamed up with Mastercard to enable easier NFT purchases.  Crypto enthusiasts have wallets and contain cryptocurrencies to own NFTs, though for the average consumer, it should be made easier, according to Mastercard. ‚ÄúExpanding the audience for NFTs allows this burgeoning market to support more creators and could spark the next evolution of digital commerce,‚Äù Mastercard‚Äôs Dhamodharan said in a blog post earlier this year.  Slowly but surely, crypto as a form of payment is increasing globally. Still, it remains to be seen as to what extent mainstream adoption will occur. For crypto natives and skeptics, one thing remains certain in that easiness of transacting and security are central.  As Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Shah puts it: ‚Äúmake it easy and they will come.‚Äù  More from Payments Week:  Crypto Payments: When the Tech Fades to the Background  The evolution in interest among TradFi, which was once dominated by diehard crypto skeptics, from crypto curiosity to crypto commitment is perhaps the industry‚Äôs most important move yet.

42407282,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVxSSU,1651160300,NFT Subscriptions Are Better Paywalls,"Subscriptions are the future of media, right? From Netflix‚Äôs (NFLX) all-you-can-eat streaming to the New York Times Co.‚Äôs (NYT) 10 million subscribers ‚Äì putting up a paywall and charging people looks like the way to go.  It‚Äôs all fun and games until you have to unsubscribe from something. The august Times is an object example. The internet has painstakingly documented the difficulties of extricating oneself from a subscription agreement with the writer of history‚Äôs first draft.  This article is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs Payments Week series.  Take for example, its place of honor in a subreddit called r/assholedesign: A screenshot of its subscription cancellation page attracted nearly 3,000 upvotes and 123 comments. The Times offers subscribers two ways to get out of it: have a chat with a ‚Äúcustomer care advocate‚Äù or dial an 800 number within, admittedly, generous operating hours (up to 10 p.m. on weekdays!). Of course, all the customer care advocates are occupied, so a chat with them isn‚Äôt possible.  The author Cory Doctorow calls the Times‚Äô cancellation page an example of late-stage capitalism‚Äôs inevitable creation of ‚Äúpaperwork tsunamis‚Äù: You can get in easily, but there‚Äôs an ‚Äúinfinitude of hurdles‚Äù to get out. So ‚Ä¶ do blockchains fix this? I‚Äôm glad you asked! (Sorry, Cory, I know you‚Äôre not a fan.)  Blockchains are good at putting power in the hands of end users. That‚Äôs because a cryptocurrency token is a bearer asset: it can be exchanged and retain its value without the need for a third party. Examples are gold, cash or the bearer bonds in ""Die Hard.‚Äù  Tokenizing subscriptions turns them into bearer assets, and that flips the relationship between publisher and reader on its head. Instead of a publisher holding a readers‚Äô account details, it‚Äôs the other way around ‚Äì readers now hold the keys to the content gates, and they can do what they like with those keys.  Unlocking content with a single NFT  The future of paywalls matters because it‚Äôs increasingly the way the news industry pays for itself. According to the Reuters Institute‚Äôs annual study on news publishing trends, more people than ever are paying for their news online. Some 17% of readers polled globally by the institute say they‚Äôve paid for news online in some form in the last year, up two points over the previous year. To be sure, most people are still getting their news for free, but the trend towards paid news is growing, especially in wealthy countries.  Read More: Crypto Payments: When the Tech Fades to the Background  As more paywalls are erected, a future where readers are trapped by various ‚Äúpaperwork tsunamis‚Äù looms. What if readers had a single key that could unlock various content gates? Even better if that key were a token they held in their wallet.  This has already happened, with the wallet provider MyCrypto. It uses something called Unlock Protocol to gate parts of its services using non-fungible tokens (NFT). If a user holds the right NFT, they can access MyCrypto‚Äôs Discord, or have ads scrubbed from the website. This means a single NFT can unlock content across different platforms and environments ‚Äì a welcome solution to a multi-paywall world.  Self-custody  Another page legacy media can take from the crypto playbook is self-custody. As the nightmarish un-subscribe experience above illustrates, readers would be better served if they could cancel their subscriptions at any time. But doing this means they, not the publisher, have to control the keys.  This idea is self-custody, and it‚Äôs the foundational notion behind holding cryptocurrencies. The premise is to exclude intermediaries such as banks, who you pay to control your assets, and instead you control your assets directly.  Not your keys, not your coins, as they say. This is a daunting prospect for, say, securing your entire net worth. But for managing your streaming and newspaper subscriptions? It might be the perfect solution, if it means side-stepping dark patterns.  NFTs: A cheaper option for publishers  There‚Äôs one more reason to use a blockchain to solve paywalls: It‚Äôs probably cheaper. Since blockchains are by their nature transparent and open source, they create a commons for users to draw on.  With Unlock Protocol, for instance, anyone can in theory tokenize a paywall with its system because the code is open-source and the smart contracts have been deployed to the Ethereum network. A publisher doesn‚Äôt have to create its own system or rely on the efforts of a company. Instead, it can leverage an open technology, and in Unlock‚Äôs case, even hold its native tokens to propose and vote on changes.  The key to our paywalled future  The future of tokenized media doesn‚Äôt rest with Unlock. Indeed, it doesn‚Äôt even rest with any single protocol or project. Instead, the needs of publishers and readers are being solved by composing different Web 3 technologies to create solutions.  Read More: The Future of Crypto Payments Will Be Centralized  This is what has happened with Headline, a project by Unlock that leans on development work by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called RaidGuild, data hosting and addressing from Ceramic, and encryption features from a project called Lit. The result is a sort of tokenized Substack.  As paywalls proliferate, both publishers and readers must be careful not to get hemmed in. We can lock up content, but we must have an equitable and sustainable way of doing so ‚Äì or else, we simply create a Kafka-esque bureaucracy to trap readers, while excluding others who can‚Äôt afford to enter this walled garden in the first place. The solution rests on making sure the right people are holding the keys to our paywalled future.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin trades at a premium in the Japanese yen markets.  Chartist's Corner: Spike in global FX volatility, boon or curse for bitcoin?  And check out the CoinDesk TV show ‚ÄúFirst Mover,‚Äù hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner, Dragonfly Capital  Dan Jeffries, managing director, AI Infrastructure Alliance  Market Moves  Bitcoin (BTC) traded higher for the second day as the yen and euro tanked against the dollar and a gauge of foreign exchange (FX) market volatility hit a two-year high.  The top cryptocurrency by market value neared $40,000, having jumped 3% to $39,000 on Wednesday, CoinDesk data shows. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, rose 1%, topping $2,900.  The Japanese yen slipped to 130.80 per U.S. dollar, the lowest in 20 years. The currency has fallen more than 10% in seven weeks. While such rapid moves are the norm in crypto markets, they are rare in currency markets and perhaps damaging to nations. Sharp currency depreciation imports inflation and often has domestic investors pouring money into the perceived store of value assets like bitcoin and gold.  Bitcoin has recently been drawing a premium in Japanese yen markets. Still, it may be too early to say that cryptocurrency is the preferred safe haven of investors exposed to the yen's volatility.  ""Bitcoin traded at a consistent premium on Japanese markets since the start of April,"" Dessislava Aubert, analyst at Kaiko Research, told CoinDesk in an email. ""However, BTC-JPY trade volumes remained low, which does not indicate a durable increase in demand in local markets.""  Aubert added that volumes could pick up if Japan decides to loosen its coin listing regulation.  Why is the yen falling?  Experts say increasingly divergent central-bank policies have driven the yen's slide this year. While the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked rates in March and plans to raise rates six more times by year-end, the Bank of Japan has remained committed to money printing.  ""The growing monetary policy divergence between the U.S. Fed and the Bank of Japan alongside higher commodities prices have put significant pressure on the Japanese currency with the JPY touching 20-year lows against the U.S. Dollar,"" Aubert said.  Bitcoin's programmed tightening path  While the Bank of Japan is moving in the opposite direction from the Fed, bitcoin's monetary policy is on a programmed tightening path.  Bitcoin's pace of supply expansion is reduced by 50% every four years, and the so-called ""reward halving"" is due in 2024, after which the per block reward would drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.  Even so, the cryptocurrency has lost over 40% in five months, mainly due to the Fed rate hike fears.

As we can see on the weekly chart, rapid growth and increased trading volumes are not yet an indicator of the strength of buyers. Especially if for almost a year before the 1INCH price fell steadily. For 4 weeks of March, buyers were able to raise the 1INCH price by 55%. Instead, sellers lowered the price before the start in the same 4 weeks and made twice as much effort. https://www.tradingview.com/x/y5MHLb4y/ Therefore, nothing will stop sellers from continuing to fall to the critical mark of $1. This mark is the last chance for buyers to change the market situation. Below $1 in the 1INCH market, a long-term depression will begin and the search for a strong foundation to stop falling prices. Thus, a positive scenario for the cryptocurrency 1INCH is to stop the price near the $1 range and start a set of positions for growth in the form of consolidation. The beginning of a new growth trend can be considered the fact that the price is fixed above $1.3. As soon as buyers manage to break the mark of $1.3 and fix above it in the weekly timeframe, it will be a signal for conservative investors to buy 1INCH cryptocurrency with a target of $1.9.

Consequently, top companies are investing in building and adopting the metaverse concept. For example, Microsoft bought Activision-Blizzard for $68 billion to add its content to its metaverse project. The metaverse is a social interaction-focused virtual 3D world that integrates augmented reality(AR), virtual reality(VR), and avatars. Combining the three has led to new interaction, socialization, and earning forms. On the metaverse, users can develop, build, trade, learn, attend meetings, meet up with friends, attend concerts, etc. New technologies always bring about further questions and concerns as they develop and attract people. In metaverse&apos;s case, many things are yet to be figured out since it is in the initial stages of development. One of these is legal concerns involving data and consumer privacy, real estate, antitrust, intellectual property, and financial regulation are facing many questions. As for now, we are left to ask ourselves; Could the metaverse bring about virtual laws? Could Avatar Lawyers be a Thing? As the metaverse grows, we might see avatar lawyers.

42421635,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXojJF,1651150200,Crypto Funds‚Äô Easy On-Ramp Can Be a Big Problem Without the Right Guidance,"Interest in crypto investments is growing steadily from clients of financial advisors, and those advisors are looking for ways to capitalize.  You want to help your clients, and you‚Äôve even done some research. You learned about some of the investment theses behind bitcoin (BTC) and crypto assets, and you have some knowledge of wallets.  While you want to help your clients allocate to crypto, you‚Äôre not ready to set up wallets, or have their funds move off your main financial platform and outside your workflows.  There are plenty of crypto fund options available now, allowing you and your clients to dip your toes in the crypto waters without too much upfront time and resources spent changing processes, tools and amending compliance reporting.  Just as with other investments, you have to do your homework and due diligence on the prospect of placing client investments into crypto funds and on the funds themselves.  First, we need to look at some of the reasons you want to use funds and the potential drawbacks.  Why use funds?  If you are new to adding crypto conversations to your practice, you likely have not yet determined any additional revenue models. You might be in the process of evaluating different relationships with crypto custodians. However, your clients are asking you to help them invest in crypto soon.  Crypto funds, and crypto-related funds can be that bridge to get you to a practice that more natively allocates to digital assets.  Crypto funds are usually available on most traditional custodial platforms like Schwab, Fidelity and Altruist, meaning you can help your clients allocate without leaving the custodian. This also makes rebalancing and reporting much easier, and can fit within your workflows.  You can also use this strategy to add some crypto exposure for clients, while maintaining an assets under management (AUM) business model. Your clients will get to experience the volatility, and you will have the opportunity to see if their interest is in a real allocation, or in speculation based on hype. The conversations you have with your clients during volatile periods in crypto will be especially informative. You will have the opportunity to use some of your knowledge while also assessing how emotionally prepared your clients are for this asset class.  Read More: Financial Advisors, Bitcoin Is the Next Amazon  Another benefit to using crypto funds is the fund companies have taken care of those custodial and security issues. Digital assets come with a new custodial or ownership model, which is a technology known as wallets. If you aren‚Äôt yet prepared to help clients set up their own wallets and custody their assets, you can essentially outsource that setup to the fund companies. Part of your due diligence now is the security of the fund companies, but you don‚Äôt yet have to fully understand, or take on the potential liability of helping a client set up their own wallets.  One last benefit to crypto funds is that they are professionally managed, and can offer some diversification within the crypto space. If your clients want to own more than just bitcoin, you likely don‚Äôt have the time or expertise to manage a crypto portfolio. By choosing a fund, you are outsourcing the tasks of research, strategy, and diversification to the more experienced fund management teams.  Why not use funds?  All the positives sound great, so why wouldn‚Äôt you just use funds to help your clients invest in crypto?  Investing in crypto funds, whether they are trusts or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exposes your clients to the price of crypto assets, but it doesn‚Äôt entail direct ownership of those assets. The prices of the funds will not always correlate exactly with the price of bitcoin or other crypto assets.  These funds may also charge fees that are higher than the fees you and your clients are used to paying. While the potential returns may be outsized compared to traditional funds, you should be prepared to answer questions from clients and auditors regarding fees.  Part of the ethos of crypto is the idea of sovereign ownership ‚Äì the ability to have custody and control of your own assets. By moving a client into a crypto fund, you are technically eschewing the purpose of the technology underpinning the new asset class. You are outsourcing a great deal of security and trust to the fund company, and you are subjecting clients to the potential for censorship. This means the government can determine the legality of the assets and the investments within them. Those funds could be heavily regulated or even seized.  Summary  If you are looking to add crypto-related discussions to your practice but aren‚Äôt completely up to date with your education of the space and your business strategy, funds can be an easy on-ramp to satisfy client demand. Although they are easier than helping your clients directly own crypto, you still need to perform your due diligence in an effort to maintain your fiduciary obligations.  Crypto funds can be the bridge that helps you determine how to build crypto and digital assets into your financial service practice.

42395474,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxGi4,1651147200,Battered Bitcoin Miners Increasingly Turn to Debt Financing,"Debt financing will be a positive catalyst for the shares of the publicly traded crypto miners whose stocks have tumbled this year as crypto and broader equity markets saw significant sell-offs, according to Wall Street analysts.  Due to their high correlation to the prices of the assets they mine, crypto mining stocks saw rapid appreciation last year as the price of bitcoin soared to an all-time-high. However, the rally evaporated this year with a lower bitcoin price, rising network hashrate and brutal competition.  With markets off their peak, access to capital has also become somewhat restricted for the miners who need large amounts of funding to stay competitive and grow. ‚ÄúAccess to the three M‚Äôs (money, megawatts and mining rigs) matters more than ever and based on investors' concerns around capital needs, accessing capital efficiently seems to matter the most right now,‚Äù said investment bank BTIG‚Äôs analyst Gregory Lewis in a research note this week.  One way miners will be able to navigate this environment is by delivering on their promises to fund growth in more efficient ways by borrowing money, rather than just raising equity. ‚ÄúWe expect funding concerns for some miners to be addressed in the near term as the BTC mining financing market matures which should be a positive catalyst for miners [who are] able to access debt financing,‚Äù Lewis wrote.  This was echoed by investment bank D.A. Davidson‚Äôs analyst Chris Brendler in a recent research report. ‚ÄúWe expect improved execution [of mining operations] and broadening access to debt capital to be positive catalysts [for the miners] near term,‚Äù Brendler wrote.  As the industry matures, debt capital is preferred by investors, given its nondilutive nature. Indeed, offering equity in the current market has often not been kind to the share price of miners. Most recently, shares of TeraWulf (WULF), which uses 100% clean energy to power its mining operations, tumbled about 30% on April 12 after the company said it would raise $20.6 million by selling common stock. Another miner, Digihost (DGHI), said in March that it would raise $250 million through an ‚Äúat-the-market (ATM)‚Äù equity program, which allows the miners to sell shares from time to time. At the time, Digihost‚Äôs market cap was less than $100 million, making a capital raise of $250 million ‚Äì even over a period of time ‚Äì a sizable amount. The shares of the stock fell about 18% on March 4, according to FactSet data.  That hasn‚Äôt stopped some of the miners from keeping their options open to equity raises through ATM offerings, however. Most recently, Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Bit Digital (BTBT) and Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI) all filed to sell up to $500 million in shares. TeraWulf also filed a replacement prospectus of its February ATM program in April to offer up to $200 million worth of shares. And in February, Hut 8 (HUT) launched a $65 million ATM offering while Marathon Digital (MARA) also filed to raise $750 million through a similar offering. The share prices didn‚Äôt react as negatively right away, given the filings were ‚Äúshelf‚Äù registrations, meaning there was no present intention to immediately sell all the securities being registered. However, most of these stocks have traded down with the market since their announcements.  Creative ways to raise debt  In light of such market conditions, raising debt through creative ways has become an emerging trend among miners as more lenders enter the market, Argo Blockchain's (ARBK) CEO Peter Wall said during an earnings conference call on Thursday. ""There are just more of them [lenders] that are available now than there was 12 months ago,"" he said, adding that 18 months ago, there basically were no debt financing options available to the miners.  Read more: The Future of Mining Finance: Time to Get Creative  Using specialized bitcoin mining computers, called ASICs, as collateral for loans has become popular among miners to fund their growth plans, as well as using mined digital assets as collateral. Most recently, bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK) raised $35 million in equipment financing backed by 3,336 new Bitmain S19j Pro bitcoin miners. Meanwhile, Australian bitcoin miner Iris Energy (IREN) secured $71 million in equipment financing backed by 19,800 S19j Pro miners and miner Greenidge Generation (GREE) raised $81.4 million in S19j Pro-backed loans.  ‚ÄúAlthough spreads and advance rates are no longer improving in this environment, we still see an increasing opportunity to leverage secured debt solutions, such as bitcoin-backed debt facilities and rig collateralized equipment financing,‚Äù Brendler wrote in his note. ‚ÄúThe sector has also matured with an expanding set of lenders that are starting to include more traditional financial institutions for the first time,‚Äù he added.  However, BTIG‚Äôs Lewis warns that access to ‚Äúattractive capital‚Äù or debt terms that are more favorable for the miners may not be possible for all of them. He believes larger bitcoin miners such as Riot, Marathon Digital, Core Scientific (CORZ) and CleanSpark will have multiple options to raise debt, including asset backed and potentially corporate debt.  In fact, Argo's Wall said he thinks that lenders are going to be more selective about whom they are lending to, with new miners that don't have a history of building mines or existing relationships with lenders potentially finding it difficult to get financing. ""I think miners that have track records, that have existing teams in place and have relationships in place are the miners that are going to be able to grow [and get financing],"" he said.

42395459,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxGSK,1651145742,"Morgan Stanley Says Over 100 Crypto Assets Were Created in Past Week, Mainly on DeFi Exchanges","Cryptocurrencies have traded like risk assets because of stimulus from governments and central banks, but tighter Federal Reserve policy means that the ‚Äúliquidity-driven crypto momentum trade‚Äù has reversed, Morgan Stanley said in a note published Tuesday.  The growth in bitcoin's market capitalization has generally tracked the growth in the global M2 money supply, the report said, noting that the crypto market capitalization grew 10-fold from the start of 2020 amid central bank easing. The crypto market cap has fallen from a peak of $2.92 trillion in November last year to under $2 trillion.  Despite the recent fall in cryptocurrency prices, the creation of digital assets is still high, with more than 100 created in the past week or so, mainly on decentralized exchanges, analysts from the bank said. Decentralized finance (DeFi) user growth has tracked ether prices, it noted.  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without the use of traditional intermediaries.  Morgan Stanley observed that trading activity has been weak during the ‚Äúcrypto bear market‚Äù, with exchange trading volumes of around $750 billion in March, half that of the peak last November. Trading volumes have generally tracked the bitcoin price, it added.  Bitcoin has had a high correlation with equities since early 2020, and has had almost zero correlation with gold recently, the report said, noting that the cryptocurrency has been more correlated with the media and entertainment stocks in the U.S., as both are possibly driven by similar factors.

The cryptocurrency jumped 19% that day, which was the biggest single-day gain since Oct. 28, according to data provided by TradingView.  ""Musk's acquisition of Twitter, which has played a key role in crypto discourse and has adopted the asset class, has spurred speculation about possible implications,"" crypto derivatives firm FRNT Financial's daily newsletter dated April 26 said.

""Speculation about any role DOGE may play at a Musk-owned Twitter has also been spurred by some media outlets,"" FRNT said.  Musk is an outspoken proponent of cryptocurrencies and a longtime dogecoin fan.  In December, Musk, in response to a CoinDesk article, tweeted ""Dooooge,"" suggesting the dog-themed cryptocurrency could help retail investors bypass high Ethereum transaction costs and access decentralized finance apps.

42395466,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxGaC,1651135448,Argent Raises $40M to Make Crypto Wallets Easier to Use,"‚ÄúNot your keys, not your coins,‚Äù goes the saying, but non-custodial crypto wallets require their owners to either memorize or otherwise securely store a 12- or 24-word seed phrase in order to properly hold and transfer their digital assets.  Argent said it offers an Ethereum mobile crypto wallet app that promises the security and user freedom of a non-custodial wallet without the need to learn and guard a seed phrase. The company has now raised $40 million in a Series B funding round co-led by early-stage venture capital firms Fabric Ventures and Metaplanet.  ‚ÄúNoncustodial crypto was really about users having some kind of secret. If they lose their secret, they lose their money. And if I find your secret, you lose your money. That‚Äôs really how any wallet works,‚Äù founder and CEO Itamar Lesuisse explained to CoinDesk in an interview. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs way too scary. It‚Äôs the most stressful experience.‚Äù  The Argent wallet backup works by using ‚Äúguardians‚Äù ‚Äì a hardware wallet, third-party service or a person who can approve account recovery or untrusted transactions.  In addition to the security features, the Argo product is intended to allow the ability to buy and stake cryptocurrencies at a fraction of the transaction or gas fees of other wallets. Users can earn up to 5% by staking ETH and up to 15% for USDC and DAI. Assets can be purchased or cashed out with a payment card or bank transfer. The app uses the native security of the mobile operating systems  The low transaction costs are due to the use of zkSync, a type of layer 2, or companion, Ethereum scaling system called a zero-knowledge (zk) rollup, which essentially bundles a number of transfer requests into a single blockchain transaction to improve throughput and cut fees.  ‚ÄúPart of the reason we were able to gather about half a million people on the waitlist for our [layer 2] accounts was because we reduce fees on L2 from hundreds of dollars to cents,‚Äù said Argent Marketing Vice President Chad West. This means ‚Äúcrypto is once again affordable for normal people who don‚Äôt have hundreds of dollars to invest,‚Äù he said.  Other participants in the funding round included crypto investing giant Paradigm, Index Ventures and Creandum. Strategic investors included Jump Crypto, Animoca Brands and Starkware, the company behind zk-rollup network StarkNet. Argent plans to use the funds to further its geographic expansion and expand its product use cases.  Argent has seen growing demand from Latin America and plans to expand in the region, beginning with Mexico. The firm will also continue to seek partnerships for payment methods and fiat on and off ramps that suit each region.  ‚ÄúMost of the world right now in crypto is really focused on speculation as the main use case. What you see [in Latin America] is more of a necessity to move away from the local currency,‚Äù due to inflation and a distrust of local institutions, said Lesuisse.  With the underlying wallet infrastructure firmly in place, Argent plans to build a Super App combining a number of verticals across the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3 spaces, including virtual real estate, gaming, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFT).  ‚ÄúFor every vertical, we can build a team that will explore and build solutions,‚Äù Lesuisse said. ‚ÄúWe want the wallet to be the entry point for how you discover that world.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | DAI,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/28/argent-raises-40m-to-make-crypto-wallets-easier-to-use,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00b627f728cd4e11886bf6ca31aabc0a7a343433-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This new integration will be crucial to protocols operating on Evmos to develop DeFi use cases such as stablecoins, lending and borrowing, DEXs and more. With its Mainnet live since April 26, Evmos is an application-agnostic chain built with the Cosmos network, interoperable with Ethereum environments thanks to its Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility.

Oracles, as bridges between off-chain and on-chain systems, are the third-party software in charge of feeding smart contracts with real-time data to execute their underlying transactions. Through this integration, DIA is enabling developers on Evmos to have access to data feeds for 6.000+ cryptocurrency assets to build dApps.

The exploit occurred on the Fantom Network.  Deus allows developers to build financial services such as futures trading, lending and options on its platform. (Disclosure: The writer of this report is a liquidity provider for Deus on Ethereum, Fantom and BNB Chain.)  The attacker used a flash loan to trick the way Deus's smart contracts read data on the platform‚Äôs liquidity pools. This allowed the attacker to artificially inflate the value of some assets, borrow funds and make a profit after repaying the loan.  Some $143 million were borrowed as a flash loan, blockchain data appear to show. The hacker was able to make a profit of $13.4 million. PeckShield said the total losses to the protocol could be much higher.  The Deus ecosystem comprises two tokens: DEUS and DEI. DEUS is the governance token on the platform. Minting DEI, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, burns DEUS, and redeeming DEI mints DEUS, according to developer documents.  Thursday‚Äôs exploit was the second in two months on the protocol, which was attacked in a similar manner in March for $3 million.  How the attack took place  Using the flash loan, Deus‚Äô attackers were able to temporarily manipulate prices on a liquidity pool consisting of the USD coin (USDC) stablecoin and DEI, and use the manipulated DEI price to borrow and drain the pool.  Flash loans allow DeFi users to take out millions of dollars as a loan against zero collateral. This isn‚Äôt crypto magic or free money: The loan must be repaid before the transaction ends or the smart contract reverses the transaction ‚Äì as if the loan never existed.  On the other end, liquidity pools, such as the USDC and DEI pool on Deus, rely on so-called oracles to ensure they are correctly priced at all times and any borrowing is within limits that don‚Äôt exceed the total value of those pools. Oracles are blockchain-based tools that provide smart contracts with trusted external information. These are required because blockchains can immutably store data, but can‚Äôt verify if the input data are accurate.  On Thursday, the attackers were able to take out a flash loan of over 143 million USDC, and used that to swap 9.5 million DEI, according to PeckShield. This caused the price of DEI to suddenly become more expensive than the usual exchange rate of $1.  The attacker then used some 71,000 DEI to borrow over 17.2 million DEI using the manipulated prices. The flash loan was then repaid, and the attacker managed to pocket $13.4 million.  DEUS prices fell 16.5% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data show. A bulk of these losses came after the exploit was made public.

42395460,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxGTJ,1651131235,India to Give Clarity on Tax Provision Within Two Months: Sources,"The Indian government will provide ‚Äúprocedural clarities‚Äù on tax deducted at source (TDS) within two months, said two people familiar with the matter.  The 1% TDS liability ‚Äì which will take effect on July 1 ‚Äì is the most controversial provision of India‚Äôs recently introduced crypto tax law. Another provision, which enforces a 30% capital gains tax on all transactions, took effect on April 1.  TDS is a liability enforced against the exchanges that deposit tax on behalf of sellers on the platform. It will be calculated at 1% of the transaction value. The seller would be able to set off this 1% TDS from their total tax liability of 30%.  The TDS mechanism is used to trace transactions and prevent tax evasion, according to the government.  Crypto businesses have repeatedly said the TDS is the biggest pain point in the new crypto tax legislation, with some even considering a legal challenge against the law.  It‚Äôs unlikely the government‚Äôs clarification will impact the discussions around putting up a legal challenge against the new crypto tax rules because the pain is more about the 1% quantum rather than the procedure.  ‚ÄúProcedural clarities‚Äù refer to how TDS will be calculated and how exchanges will share data with the government.  The industry is seeking clarity on two major points ‚Äì trading and swaps of virtual digital assets (VDA). VDA is the Indian government‚Äôs terminology for all cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT).  In trading, exchanges usually match buy-sell orders through algorithms and execute them. Buyers and sellers are usually unaware of to whom they bought from or sold.  Anirudh Rastogi, founder and managing partner of Ikigai Law, the firm that represented crypto exchanges in a previous legal fight against India‚Äôs central bank, said it‚Äôs unclear what happens in a crypto to crypto trade ‚Äì whether the buyer or the seller will be responsible for deducting the tax at present.  ‚ÄúRemember, the buyer and seller may never know each other or their nationality or have their PAN [an Indian taxpayer ID] or know the aggregate value of consideration received from transfer of VDAs,‚Äù Rastogi said.  The second major concern is VDA to VDA swap trades. This is when a trader exchanges one crypto asset with another. For instance, one bitcoin (BTC) is traded with another person who has another crypto asset such as four ether (ETH). Once again, it is unclear who the buyer would be, as well as, whether tax will be deducted in VDAs or fiat currency and how the cost of exchanges would be calculated.  Rajat Mittal, a senior tax counsel for India‚Äôs crypto businesses, raised the same concerns while also asking whether individual traders will need Tax Deduction account numbers for deducting TDS and how a 1% TDS would work in the case of leverage trading.  Internal discussions have already taken place within the finance ministry and tax departments and the government will have more information to share within one or two months, CoinDesk was told.

The last few years have seen the growth of cryptos skyrocket and the number of users grows. In 2021 alone, the crypto market was reported to have grown at a compound rate of 6.9%. In line with these statistics, the growth of the crypto space has only expanded over the last few years. In reports made earlier this year, the crypto space holds a valuation of about $2 trillion. This figure is up from the $828 billion valuations the crypto space held in 2018. This trend is set to continue as cryptos become even more mainstream than before. As cryptos become even more mainstream, several issues and opportunities become emergent. Due to the decentralized nature of cryptos, many issues remain unresolved. There remain many gaps with regard to policy and regulation as governments try to develop a direction for the cryptos. Thus, with regard to developing a pro-crypto stance, politicians can gain a lot of support and win elections.

Market capitalization, popularly referred to as &apos;market cap,&apos; is calculated by multiplying the current market price of a single share of a company by the total number of outstanding shares of the company.

Whereas market capitalization in the stock market is calculated by multiplying the current share price with total outstanding shares, market capitalization in the crypto realm is calculated by multiplying the current price of the cryptocurrency with the total number of coins in circulation.

They have been criticized for their extreme volatility, unregulated landscape, and potential to enable and anonymize illegal transactions. As more people embrace digital currencies, authorities in several jurisdictions have ramped up restrictions on their usage. The legal status of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies varies from country to country. Crypto usage is not strictly illegal in most countries; its status as a medium of exchange and a store of value varies with different regulatory implications. Countries With Sanctions Against Cryptocurrencies Some governments have placed limitations on how crypto is used. In countries like Nigeria, financial institutions may be penalized if they allow customers to conduct crypto transactions in their banking halls or online platforms. More authoritarian regimes outrightly forbid any crypto use within their borders. These countries have put in place heavy penalties for anyone caught contravening crypto-related laws. Algeria, for instance, passed a law in 2018 that made it illegal to hold, trade, or use crypto. Bolivia also has a total crypto ban stemming from a 2014 Central Bank resolution that outlawed the use of any form of currency not regulated by a country or an economic bloc.

42395471,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxGf7,1651104166,Bitcoin Miner Argo Raises Hashrate Guidance Thanks to Intel Mining Chips,"Bitcoin (BTC) miner Argo Blockchain‚Äôs (ARBK) raised 2022 hashrate guidance to 5.5 exahash per second (EH/s), an almost 50% increase from previous guidance of 3.7 EH/s, mostly driven by mining rigs that use Intel‚Äôs (INTC) new chips.  ‚ÄúWith our mining operations at Helios [the company's flagship mining facility located in Dickens County, Texas] expected to commence in May, along with the development of custom mining machines using Intel‚Äôs next-generation Blockscale ASIC chips, Argo is well-positioned to continue its growth with a focus on delivering for our shareholders,‚Äù said CEO Peter Wall in a statement. During an earnings conference call, Wall noted that about 33% of the projected hashrate will come from Intel-powered mining rigs.  On April 4, Chip giant Intel launched its second-generation bitcoin mining chip, called ‚ÄúIntel Blockscale ASIC,‚Äù which will offer miners more efficient mining rigs than most models available in the market. Bitcoin miners Argo Blockchain, Hive Blockchain (HIVE) and Griid Infrastructure as well as giant Block (formerly Square) will be among the first customers to receive the new Intel Blockscale ASIC.  Having Intel in the mining rig industry is ""incredibly important,"" Wall said during the company's earnings conference call. ""It gives the bitcoin mining space more credibility to have a blue-chip company like Intel coming in, but it also will benefit the industry to have a more diverse supply chain and more options for ASICs and also to have chips available as opposed to fully-baked machines,"" he said. Argo will use a third-party manufacturer to build mining machines using Intel's chips.  ""We think our custom mining rig, which is going to use these Intel mining chips, is going to be significantly cheaper on a cost per terahash basis than what's currently available off the shelf for the market, and this will allow us to further increase our hash rate and competitive markets,"" he said.  The miner also said the initial 200 megawatt (MW) out of its capacity of up to 800MW for its Helios project is expected to be operational in May. The additional capital spending to complete this first phase is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million, which will be funded mainly through debt and proceeds from selling a portion of mined bitcoins each month. During the conference call the company official said it is evaluating machine financing options for the debt funding and doesn't expect any equity raise this year.  The majority of the capital allocated for the first phase's infrastructure build and Bitmain machines has already been paid. Most of the rest will be used for Intel's mining chips, which Argo has already paid a deposit for, Wall said during the conference call.  Beyond 2022, Argo expects to grow its hashrate to more than 20 EH/s over the next few years as the additional 600MW capacity at its Helios facility comes online.  Argo also reported 2021 sales of $100.1 million, which beat the average analyst estimate of $98.3 million, according to FactSet data. Its 2021 net income was $41.5 million, lower than the consensus estimate of $45.3 million.  Shares of the miner surged about 15% in London on Thursday before falling back. Its American Depositary Receipts were up about 7%, outperforming its mining peers, while bitcoin has been mostly little changed around $39,000.
