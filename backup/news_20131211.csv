42425205,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvG7h,1386786609,Experts Discuss China and the Next 100 Big Startups at Inside Bitcoins,"Day One of the Inside Bitcoins conference in Las Vegas has come and gone, with startups and regulation-related topics being the key highlights.  The conference began with a keynote from Jered Kenna, CEO of Tradehill and an early bitcoin investor. Kenna gave a background and brief history of bitcoin, since its inception in 2008.  He also talked about China's influence on the growing virtual currency markets today. “China enters the market and just dominates,” he said.  New ideas  The ‘New Ideas in Bitcoins’ panel brought together a number of leaders who promote bitcoin around the world. Pelle Braendgaard, the co-founder of Kipochi, claimed the so-called 'unbanked' population in Africa would be a major hotspot for virtual currencies going forward.  “It’s going to grow a lot in the next year”, he told the audience.  Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of trading platform Coinsetter, presented the idea that regular traders and investors want better access to bitcoin. “Investors are taking bitcoin a lot more seriously,” he said.  Again, Lukasiewicz referenced China's impact as a major player in the bitcoin market. “China presents 70% of the trading market,” he said.  Yet, Lukasiewicz still believes that it will be the virtual currency companies based in the US that will ultimately succeed.  “Long term, US companies will win with US-focused regulation,” he added.  Future success stories  By far, the most popular session was the 'Creating and Funding the Next 100 Great Bitcoin Companies' panel.  It included; Rob Banagale, CEO and Co-Founder of Gliph; Steve Beauregard, CEO & Founder of GoCoin; Pamir Gelenbe, Venture Partner of Hummingbird Ventures; and Brock Pierce, Executive Chairman of Playzino.  Additionally, Michael Terpin, the CEO of SocialRadius was the panel moderator.  During the panel, all the room’s seats were filled. Many people were standing. It was Brock Pierce who offered the most exciting comments during the session, proclaiming: “I believe that in 2014 bitcoin will be the biggest sector for venture investing in the world. 2014 is the year of bitcoin.”  That statement garnered a round of applause from the room.  Another topic discussed by the panel was the removal of Gliph’s bitcoin transfer function from its application. A number of panelists were concerned about Apple’s new strategy regarding bitcoin apps on its platform.  Popular sessions  Other popular sessions from day one included the regulation-themed ‘Emerging Issues in Regulatory Compliance and Law Enforcement Efforts’.  This session featured a panel of lawyers experienced in virtual currency compliance, moderated by Patrick Murck, General Counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation.  A security-themed talk towards the end of the day named ‘Best Practices for Using and Securing Bitcoins’ from Alan Reiner, CEO of the open-source wallet Armory was another popular choice.  Exhibits  A number of startups were exhibiting their businesses too: LeetCoin, a platform which offers gamers bitcoin incentives was one. Another was Kryptokit, a wallet and Google Chrome plugin that provides Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) messaging within the browser.  CoinMKT  , a relatively new US exchange that offers traders access to seven different cryptocurrencies, was also presenting to conference attendees at their exhibit. And Butterfly labs, which has brought consumer bitcoin mining to the public, was showing off some new products to be released early next year.  China was a popular topic throughout the conference, following the Chinese government's statement which caused the price of bitcoin to drop significantly.

42425195,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFnh,1386785128,"Merchants Love Bitcoin, and BitPay has 100 Million Reasons to Prove it","BitPay has reached yet another all-important milestone, having processed more than $100m bitcoin transactions this year.  The company, which helps merchants to accept payment in digital currency, has brought bitcoin to a number of popular retailers, such as Gyft and Shopify, as well as bitcoin mining equipment producer KNC Miner and blog platform Wordpress.  Stephanie Wargo, BitPay's VP of marketing, said: ""We are thrilled to have reached this milestone in 2013, and we expect this growth continue in 2014. We are adding hundreds of merchants every day as they see the benefits to accepting bitcoins for the purchase of goods and services.""  She added:  ""Bitcoin is continuing to gain acceptance throughout the world, and BitPay is proud to be leading the movement. We expect to continue to see bitcoin growth in North America and Europe, but are also seeing it in Asia-Pacific and South America.""  Boosting sales  Electronics store Adafruit started accepting bitcoin, via BitPay, towards the end of November and has already witnessed a surge in sales.  ""This year, the 2013 holiday season was Adafruit's biggest ever,"" said Limor Fried, founder and engineer with Adafruit, adding:  ""We are delighted to offer bitcoin payments via BitPay to our community and customers. It was fast and easy, hundreds of orders and happy customers getting educational electronics, using bitcoin!""  Adafruit wasn't BitPay's only customer enjoying a boost in sales over the Thanksgiving period. BitPay revealed recently it had witnessed a 6,260% increase in transactions on Black Friday 2013, compared with the same day of last year.  BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi said: “[The bitcoin economy] is soaring … as merchants are seeing tremendous value in accepting bitcoin payments.”  The growth of BitPay  Gallippi co-founded BitPay, which now has over 15,000 merchants in 200 countries on its books, back in 2011 with now-CTO Stephen Pair.  The company received £2m in funding in May from venture firm Founder’s Fund, which has also invested in tech giants like Facebook and Spotify.  Gallippi spoke during last month's Senate hearings on virtual currency in Washington DC. He was the only person actually operating a virtual currency business to testify at the hearing after Chris Larsen, CEO of the Ripple Foundation, was unable to attend.  He likened bitcoin as it is now to the Internet in the early 1990s, saying bitcoin should be offered similar protection by Congress to enable it to evolve, develop and enrich people's lives in the same way.  ""If we look 10-­20 years in the future, we will see many companies built upon bitcoin-­related technology. We want those companies to be based in America, creating jobs in America, and building a revenue base and tax base in America,"" he said, suggesting that the government should not pigeonhole or over-regulate bitcoin.  It is not yet clear whether or not the US government will decide to create regulation for bitcoin. In the meantime, BitPay is continuing to expand and develop the features it offers. It recently launched its directory of merchants, which shows some of the retailers that are now accepting bitcoin across the world.

42425208,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvGDh,1386777610,Bitcoin and Intrinsic Value: a Layman’s Response to Alan Greenspan,"Editor’s note: Matt Mihaly, a bitcoin fan and entrepreneur, recently wrote this article in response to Alan Greenspan's recent comments on bitcoin. Alan Greenspan is an American economist who served as Chairman of the US Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006.  Mr Greenspan,  I saw your recent comments regarding bitcoin on Bloomberg. I understand your skepticism – it wasn’t until early summer of this year that I appreciated what Bitcoin represents as a force for disruption. When I first looked at Bitcoin in 2010, I thought it looked like a techno-novelty and would likely soon collapse. It did, actually, collapse in 2011, thus confirming in my mind that it was a fad, and best ignored. Oops.  Fast forward to today, and while it is still very much the tool of a relatively technologically-savvy tiny fraction of the world population, it’s been remarkably tenacious. Its price as pegged to fiat currency is very volatile, but has trended unsteadily upwards for years now, consistently, until its recent large run-up appeared to catch your attention.  Specifically, what you said was:  “It [bitcoin] has to have intrinsic value. You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is. I haven’t been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.”  I’m not an economist, and I can’t speak to you as one. I do have some experience with virtual currencies though, and think I have a handle on why Bitcoin is so potentially revolutionary.  When you tell us that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, I can’t disagree, but I also don’t think that’s relevant.  Houses don’t have any (or very minimal) intrinsic value either, and one only has to tour Detroit, with its legions of abandoned houses, to see that that’s the case.  Does that mean houses generally don’t have any value? I don’t think so, and as a homeowner, I sure hope not. Indeed, I’m sure that my house has value, because I’m sure someone else will be willing to buy it from me if I choose to sell it.  But why would someone buy the house if it has no intrinsic value? As we know from places like Detroit, it’s possible for the value of a house to simply disappear, or come very close to it (pipes can be stripped for copper, and a few other things may be worth salvaging, but that’s fractions of a penny on the dollar).  So where does that value come from if it isn’t intrinsic to the house itself?  I’ll come back to that question, and explain how it’s related to bitcoin’s value. But first, I want to tell you a story. I’ll try to keep it brief.  Virtual Swords  Once upon a time, at the end of the last millennium, I founded and led the first games company to sell virtual goods or virtual currency for real money.  We sold (and still sell) ‘credits’ – virtual currency that is bought for real money, which players can use to buy other things in our games. Players can buy virtual weapons, new abilities for characters, virtual pets, virtual gold, virtual housing, upgrades to ships, or even custom work from the development team. What they can’t do is sell those credits back to us for real money.  When I first started selling credits, a lot of people, including almost everyone in the games industry who was aware of what we were doing (not a huge number of people as we were operating at the periphery of the industry), thought it was ridiculous. The general criticism was along the lines of: “Why would someone pay real money for a fake sword?”  I mean, they have a point right? Why would you give up real money to get this fake currency – credits – which you could only use to buy other fake things? How could the credits possibly have value?  Here’s the thing though. We started selling credits in 1997. The only way to pay was via check or cash, mailed to us (though that changed quickly). Players had to go through the hassle, in other words, of actually sending us a letter and waiting for it to arrive to buy credits. This was days in most cases. Even with that amount of hassle, they wanted to buy these virtual things.  16 years later, people are still buying these credits, and they’re even used to pay other people for third-party services around our games in a couple of cases.  Other companies, like Electronic Arts and Zynga, have collectively sold billions of dollars worth of their equivalent of credits in the last decade. The idea that these ‘fake’ currencies and ‘fake’ items have real value is pretty difficult to dispute given the amount of money consumers have poured into them.  Even in games that don’t directly sell the currency, there’s often a robust business being done by third parties in obtaining and re-selling currencies that must be earned by playing the game.  Why do these virtual currencies, which are often hard to convert back to cash, if at all, continue to have value?  It’s their context. In this case, the context is our games. Although they’re free to play forever without paying, a percentage of players (a high % in our case) eventually buy credits. Those credits can get them something they want, and whether you want to classify a virtual sword as a ‘good’ or a ‘service’ doesn’t matter – it allows a player to achieve a desired result within a context that matters to that player.  And that’s the point I’m making here – a virtual sword has value because of the context in which it exists.  A virtual sword on a game you don’t play is more or less worthless to you. A print-out of the data that makes up that virtual sword is worthless to you. The item only has value because of the context the game service provides.  Further, we’ve found that the stronger we make that context – the more engrossing and all-encompassing the game world becomes – the more people want to buy things within it.  The stronger the context, the more potential value things that are part of that context can have.  Motor City  Let’s go back to Detroit. Why does my house in the Bay Area hold value far above what it could be salvaged for, while hundreds of houses in Detroit were simply abandoned as valueless?  Once again, the context. Detroit is a large part of the context that informs the value of houses in it, and it’s grown vastly weaker than when it reigned as one of America’s premiere cities. As a result, the houses in it have lost value, and some have become worthless.  The Bay Area, on the other hand, is having an extended tech-driven renaissance that’s created enormous wealth and buoyed demand for real estate. It’s context is strong.  Of course, context is not simply local. It’s simultaneously local, regional, national, global and more.  The entire housing market in the US took a dive, as you well know, Mr Greenspan, a few years ago. There, the national context was so strongly affected that it overrode almost any positive influence from regional or local contexts within the US – if you owned a house anywhere in the US, it probably lost value in 2008 and 2009.  Thus, we can see that the value of a house is not really intrinsic, but is largely dependent on the context within which it exists.  What’s all this have to do with Bitcoin?  The Currency and the network  Confusingly, when the anonymous creator of the Bitcoin protocol named it, he chose to use the same word to refer both to the unit of value that is traded (bitcoin, with a lower-case b) and the payment network over which bitcoin travels and the way in which it’s stored, referred to as Bitcoin (with a capital B).  A good analogy is email: Without a network to carry email over, there’d be no value in composing an email – it wouldn’t have anywhere to go when you hit ‘send’.  Similarly, bitcoin would be worth nothing without the payment network that it sits on. You could have all the bitcoin in the world and if there wasn’t a network behind it, nobody would care. There’d be no context – just meaningless digital bits sitting on a hard drive.  Now, we know that payment networks are valuable. Just ask Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Western Union, and Moneygram.  We also know that methods of storing value persistently are valuable. Most of the world’s governments have a gold reserve. The US government alone holds over 8,000 tons of it.  But what a hassle! Someone has to actually store that gold, which weighs 8,000 tons, and selling it means physically transporting it.  Still, gold is valuable and commands the price it does mainly because people have agreed it’s valuable, even though it experiences wide volatility in value over time, and even though it’s fairly inconvenient.  Bitcoin is both of these things — a payment network and a way of storing value. You could transfer a million dollars for the cost of a few cents, on a holiday.  Paypal won’t let you do that, and even if you could transfer that much at once, they’d charge you multiple percentage points for it.  Visa/Mastercard certainly won’t let you do it, as they’re built on credit, and if Western Union would let you, they’d charge you even more than Paypal would.  You could send a bank wire, but that’ll cost you $25 or more, and if sent after the wire cut-off time, you’re out of luck until the next day. And, of course, that assumes you even have a bank account to begin with, a service that only about half of adults worldwide have access to.  And unlike gold, bitcoin is practically free to store (though like any other asset, security precautions need to be taken).  What we have, then, is a nearly frictionless way to send and store value of virtually any magnitude. I don’t think it takes a lot of imagination to understand why that might be a context that’s strong enough to create substantial value within it.  As Erik Voorhees (a prominent early adopter of Bitcoin) recently wrote:    Because the Bitcoin network is useful, and because only scarce bitcoin currency units are permitted on this network, the bitcoins themselves have a price. Indeed, they must have a price until the network is no longer useful, or the coins are no longer scarce.      This is not magic. It is not a Ponzi scheme or elaborate fraud. It’s just the market pricing something that it finds useful. As the network grows in usage, its utility subsequently grows, and thus scarce bitcoins appreciate further.    You see, Mr. Greenspan, it all comes back to context. The lower-case bitcoin has value because it is scarce (limited to 21 million) and because the context of the Bitcoin payment network creates the opportunity for things within that context to have value.  Better still for Bitcoin is that Metcalfe’s Law is likely to be partly relevant at least. It states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of users connected to it. As Bitcoin grows, its utility as a network grows, and the unit of currency (bitcoin) in that network is likely to be even more valued as a result.  Bitcoin in Context  I believe, Mr. Greenspan, that the context (the payment/storage network) within which bitcoin (currency) exists grants it indisputable value, whether that value is 'less than' or 'greater than' is represented by the price of a bitcoin today. I think you’d have a difficult time disputing that.  Beyond that though, I also believe that the context within which Bitcoin (the payment/storage network) exists grants it value, and that whether it’s Bitcoin or another digital currency, the context of the modern world grants the Bitcoin payment/storage network increasingly large potential value.  There is a real demand for a digital, supra-national currency, and bitcoin is the current most likely contender to take that position. It’s not going to replace fiat currency, but it is going to sit alongside it.  The US and Chinese governments are engaged in unprecedented hidden taxation of anyone holding the US dollar or the Chinese yuan in reserve by simply issuing more of them (many, many more).  That’s not possible with Bitcoin, and whether or not one believes that a deflationary or inflationary currency is preferable, it’s certainly easy to see why some people like having a store of value that cannot be devalued unilaterally by a government (though as the recent drop in price in reaction to China’s official position on financial institutions trading bitcoin shows, governments certainly have a voice in Bitcoin’s future).  The hundreds of billions of dollars remitted back to home countries by (generally) poor immigrants grows every year. They pay an average of over 9% to transfer that money. That’s highway robbery on the backs of the people who can least afford it. Bitcoin can solve that long-term.  [post-quote]  It’s currently difficult to pay a few cents for, say, reading an online article from the NY Times – the transaction costs via traditional payment transfer networks are prohibitive at that small scale.  Bitcoin can revolutionize the relationship between content publishers and consumers by reducing the friction that stops both parties from micro-transacting on a scale appropriate for that moment, vs. asking the consumer to subscribe for $10/month, or asking the consumer to front-load an online wallet with $5 and then spend it in increments.  In short, Mr Greenspan, there are a lot of reasons why Bitcoin is here to stay at one level or another. The bitcoin currency has value because the network has value. The network has value because it is and will be used to solve actual problems that actual people and institutions experience.  Is that intrinsic value? Beats me – as I said, I’m not an economist.  It’s certainly value though, and as long as that’s true – as long as the context makes it so – bitcoin will continue to be worth something no different from gold, houses in Detroit, or virtual swords in video games.

42425198,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFfh,1386774032,BTC-e: Our Recent Issues Were Caused By a Surge In Users,"Earlier this month we reported on a number of banking issues experienced by BTC-e users. The problems were related to the status of investor deposits, which were delayed en route to BTC-e.  The fact that the operators of BTC-e wish to remain anonymous (and go to great lengths to do so) did not help either.  BTC-e is anything but transparent: it uses third-party banking services to keep its name out of official records. At least one of the banks involved in the process is located in the Czech Republic; the BTC-e site references Bulgaria in its SEO descriptions; the founders, Russian programmers Aleksey and Alexander, honed their skills at the Skolkovo tech park; and the BTC-e managing company is based in Cyprus.  With all that in mind, it is understandable that investors were concerned by the issues.  Luckily BTC-e got in touch with CoinDesk to reassure the public that it is a legitimate operation. The team still wishes to remain anonymous (they wouldn't share their surnames), but the duo were willing to shed more light on BTC-e operations and the recent spate of banking issues. We were told that the problems were caused by a sudden influx of users over the last few weeks. Aleksey said:  “In November, we increased attendance from an average of 2-3k users to 13-15k. The number of bank transfers increased from 15-20 per day to 200-300 per day. In most cases, the delay in depositing bank transfers was associated with wrong payment details.""  Aleksey told us that BTC-e is experiencing a shortage of personnel due to the increase in traffic and trading volume. The fact that BTC-e was understaffed apparently caused the delays, but we were told that the team is expanding and new members are currently undergoing training. BTC-e plans to announce the expansion soon.  Due to the nature of BTC-e’s money transfer system, this could have been a major problem. Although we like to think of bitcoin as a purely digital currency, the way BTC-e processes transfers is hardly simple, and it necessitates a lot of manpower.  BTC-e also pointed out that they have been in business for more than two and a half years, and reimbursed users affected when BTC-e’s LR API Secret Key was compromised last summer.  BTC-e insists that it was never hacked and that there is no reason for alarm.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/11/btc-e-our-recent-issues-were-caused-by-a-surge-in-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c38ad7642904a0bef68e85859a7baebcabd78031-1000x806.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397291,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSAQ,1386768322,Rumours of BTC China Deal with Chinese Retail Giant Suning 'Are False',"The bitcoin community has been abuzz about news that Chinese retail giant Suning is in talks with BTC China, the world's largest bitcoin exchange by volume, about integrating bitcoin payments into the retailer's e-commerce platform. But Bobby Lee, BTC China's founder, says the news is not accurate.  ""Sorry, I have actually not heard about this. Where did you see this?"" Lee wrote in an e-mail after CoinDesk contacted him for clarification on the supposed partnership.  News about a supposed deal between the two firms discussed on reddit four days ago. The reddit post pointed to an article published on iFeng, a respected Chinese news site, on 5th Dec. iFeng is published by Phoenix New Media, a New York Stock Exchange-listed media firm. The publisher grew out of Phoenix Satellite Television, a global Chinese-language network based in Hong Kong.  The iFeng article claimed that a Suning insider had leaked the news that the retailer was in talks with BTC China to enable bitcoin payments on Suning Yigou, the retailer's e-commerce platform where it sells electronics and other products direct to consumers. According to the article, the two parties were in close talks.  Redditors jumped on the news with excitement, with the reddit thread attracting 29 comments, and counting. The thread's title announced optimistically:  ""China's largest electrical appliance retailer, Suning, is planning to adopt bitcoin""  A separate reddit thread suggested Suning was also preparing to accept payments in another digital currency, litecoin.  China's bitcoin buzz  China has been at the centre of several major developments surrounding the use and regulation of bitcoin in the last week. On 5th Dec, China's central bank issued its first statement on bitcoin, publishing a note on its website saying that financial institutions were not permitted to deal in bitcoin. Bitcoin exchanges would also be required to register their users as anonymous trading in the digital currency would not be permitted. However, the bank made clear that individuals could freely use the cryptocurrency.  As a result of the Chinese central bank statement, two major Chinese companies appeared to withdraw their plans to start accepting bitcoin for products and services. One of those companies is Baidu, the search engine giant. It published a statement on 6th Dec saying that it would no longer accept bitcoin payments for its Jiasule website optimisation service. The firm had announced it would take bitcoin payments on 14th Oct.  China Telecom, which dominates the country's fixed-line subscriptions, also appeared to have removed all references to accepting bitcoin payments from several advertisements it had published earlier. One of these was an offer for customers to buy a gold iPhone 5S with bitcoin. China Telecom has the third-largest mobile subscriber base in the country, lagging behind market leader China Mobile.  Hybrid financial models  China's rapid adoption of bitcoin is just the latest example of the innovative, hybrid financial models that have gained popularity in the People's Republic. According to Zennon Kapron, founder of financial services consulting firm Kapronasia, one of the key issues in China is the line dividing financial institutions from other firms. Kapron recently gave a talk to the Shanghai Foreign Correspondents' Club on bitcoin in China. He said:  ""The line is really blurring right now in China as to which companies are considered financial institutions.""  Kapron gave the example of e-commerce titan Alibaba, which has introduced more bank-like features to its online payments platform Alipay. Users can opt for a new investment tool from Alipay called Yu'ebao, an online-only money-market fund that offers users a yield of more than 6%. The service has proved popular, with 2.5 million users signing up for it within three weeks of its launch.  ""The Alipay division of Alibaba now offers a high-yield money market option called Yu'ebao, [so it is] gradually becoming more like a bank,"" Kapron said.  Kapron said firms that wanted the benefits of accepting bitcoin, like Baidu, were probably taking precautionary moves, such as suspending their plans for bitcoin transactions, in the wake of the central bank announcement to protect their core business. He said:  ""Bitcoin for Baidu is good, but it's not worth the risk of attracting the attention of regulators.""  Suning is China's largest electronics retailer, operating more than 1,600 stores in over 600 cities in the country and Japan. It announced a major investment online retailing earlier this year. It faces competition from retailers like Gome and 360Buy, which have both online and physical retail stores.

42397290,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapS8S,1386765635,Bitcoin 0.8.6 Fixes Bugs And Updates Block Size Limits,"Bitcoin 0.8.6 was officially released this week and the incremental update brings a few bug fixes and some nifty features, such as relaxed restrictions on block size.  The biggest changes affect block size. The maximum size of free transactions is now 1,000 bytes instead of 10,000 bytes, allowing more transactions per block. Since each block allows 27,000 bytes for free transactions, this means that as many as 27 free transactions will be available per block, up from three or less in 0.8.5 and previous releases.  The minimum output requirement of 0.01 BTC has been dropped, too. The requirement became outdated as bitcoin value surged. Smaller outputs can now qualify as for free relaying and the maximum size for free transaction creation has been reduced as well.  Bug fixes and tweaks  Bitcoin 0.8.6  also addresses a number of bugs found in 0.8.5, namely in users running Mac OSX. Block chain corruption issues in OSX have been resolved, alternative fsync methods have been introduced and a few other tweaks were implemented to improve reliability.  Many users of OSX 10.8 and 10.9 systems experienced problems with block chain corruption, but it is unclear whether 0.8.6 will resolve all issues.  Bitcoin 0.8.6 should resolve problems related to transaction broadcasting, as 0.8.5 was prone to mistakenly using the wrong vin value, resulting in an invalid transaction. The problem was patched and should be a thing of the past.  Network code performance and robustness were improved as well. There is a new timestamp debug log that can be used to detect and diagnose network problems.  Miner default block size increased  The default -maxblocksize was increased from 300,000 to 350,000 bytes. The default space for high-priority transactions has been bumped up to 30,000 bytes. This should accommodate higher transaction volume and help measure what percentage of hashing power simply goes along with defaults. However, most miners were not using the default limit anyway and block sizes were somewhat smaller than 300,000 bytes.  Possible update issues  There is a caveat. Some users have reported running out of virtual memory on 32-bit machines during the initial sync, so it is best to use a 64-bit executable, which is not available at this point. However, 0.9.0 should feature native 64-bit support.  The update urges all users to upgrade by following these steps:    If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).      If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run 0.8.6 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/11/bitcoin-086-fixes-bugs-and-updates-block-size-limits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bf7d6cd1f1cd065afe076c191bae8f014e897f7-1000x562.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397292,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSBP,1386763821,Social Experiment: Twitter Users Prefer Bitcoin to Hard Cash,"As a startup founder using social media, I’m always thinking of new ways to engage my fans.  I'm also a bitcoin enthusiast, so I thought: “what better way to combine both of these passions than having a social media bitcoin giveaway on Twitter?”  However, this experiment wasn’t only about social media engagement, as it proved that bitcoin enthusiasts and non-users both see value in the currency.  The engagement I saw in these experiments is important for several reasons. Namely, for bitcoin to achieve longterm success, “normal” people outside of enthusiasts like myself need to see value in digital currency as something they can use to buy or exchange with.  The Kierkegaard experiment  My first experiment was built to include bitcoin's USD value into my giveaway tweet.  Who wouldn’t take a lucky guess at my favourite philosopher to earn a quick $5? Eventually someone answered Kierkegaard correctly. Realistically, it was only a matter of time after the process of elimination.  Most people have never heard of Kierkegaard, but a follower named Jesse guessed correctly and won the prize. I instantly transferred her $5 in bitcoin.  What was even more interesting was the fact that Jesse had not been involved in bitcoin before this contest. Jesse had to create a Coinbase account before she could accept the transaction, and is now an official bitcoiner.  Thus, Jesse saw enough value in bitcoin to take the time to engage in my giveaway and create a wallet after winning.  @torbahax @medium Thoreau?— Ryan LeFevre (@MeltingIce) November 30, 2013      @torbahax LLoyd Christmas?

I was shocked to not only see engagement from bitcoin enthusiasts, but also from bitcoin newcomers like Jesse too. The interesting part about this test is that 0.000877 BTC was worth only $1 at the time of the experiment.  Most of us don’t bother to pick up a penny on the ground as we walk down the street, but plenty of people were more than willing to invent some amazing bitcoin brand names for $1.  Ironically, more people submitted bitcoin startup brands for a fraction of 1 BTC than the amount of people who were willing to take a random guess at my favourite philosopher for $5.    @torbahax LOTC, One coin to rule them all!      — Stijn Pielage (@Aplus212) November 30, 2013      @torbahax Cointastic, Coiner, Coind, Koin, Coiny, Coinup, Coinco, InCoin. #BitcoinGiveaway      — Neeraj Thakur (@NeerajT4) November 30, 2013      @torbahax bittercoin - bar that only accepts bitcoin.      — Carlos Cardona (@cgcardona) November 30, 2013      @torbahax Bacoin      — Christopher Elston (@CElston) November 30, 2013      @neilswmurray @torbahax same here.

42397306,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSOC,1386758407,Mel B Spices Up Record Sales With Bitcoin,"A few days ago, legendary hip-hop artist and part-time pornographer Snoop Dogg announced he would make his upcoming album available to purchase in bitcoin.  Shortly afterwards, Snoop was contacted by Coinbase and BitPay, who were glad to take him up on the offer and make it all possible.  Another performer joined Snoop earlier this week, as former Spice Girl Mel B announced she will be the first artist to officially accept bitcoin payments for her new single. She said:  “I love how new technology makes our lives easier, and to me that’s exciting. Bitcoin unites my fans around the world using one currency. They can just pay using bitcoins!”  Mel B is working in partnership with Cloud Hashing to make it all happen. The company welcomed Mel B’s decision, saying that it will help bring bitcoin to the attention of millions of her fans around the world.  Another hip-hop artist voiced his support for bitcoin recently: Childish Gambino, better known as actor/comedian Donald Glover.  Gambino is expected to release his second studio album 'Because the Internet' this month. In a recent interview with Time magazine, he discussed the impact of the internet on pop culture and our daily lives, mentioning bitcoin in the process.  “We should definitely start looking at currency on the Internet,” he said, adding:  “Yeah, I know a lot of people are sceptical, but I feel like if everything’s going to live online, why not bitcoins? Being backed by gold seems very old and nostalgic to me. Being backed to a bitcoin, which takes time to actually make and there’s this equation that has to be done, that feels [more real] to me and makes more sense.”  Oddly enough, bitcoin appears to be getting a lot of love from the hip-hop community, the very same community that has been talking up diamond jewellery, Volkswagen-made Bentleys and overpriced champagne for years.

42397307,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapSQA,1386756056,Quantifying Price Fragmentation Across Bitcoin's Biggest Exchanges,"One feature of bitcoin that clearly demarcates it from other major currencies in circulation today is the dramatic variation in its price across exchanges.  But why is bitcoin so unlike the major national currencies in this regard? Additionally, is this price fragmentation a characteristic of all decentralized alternative currencies, or just a temporary phenomenon?  The law of one price  The US dollar and other major national currencies effectively trade at the same price, regardless of whether they are exchanged in Tokyo, London, New York, or any other major foreign exchange market.  Small discrepancies in price may be observed periodically, but they are quickly pounced on and erased by algorithmic arbitrageurs seeking to profit from such asymmetries.  [post-quote]  In short, the price for US dollars across the world’s major exchanges trades in lockstep.  The reason for the near-perfect price synchronization we see in major currencies like the US dollar relates to an economic concept known as the ‘law of one price’.  Put simply, this concept means that prices for fungible, freely-traded items like currency should be equal across all open markets.  If we were to observe any material, persistent price variation between US dollars exchanged in Tokyo versus those exchanged in London, then this would be due to the existence of some cost or barrier – like variations in transaction fees, the speed at which information can travel, transportation expenses, or restrictions to the flow of funds.  However, we do not observe any such variance, due to the very low frictions across the major forex markets.  Measuring Bitcoin price differences across exchanges  In contrast to the forex markets for major currencies like the US Dollar, at any given moment the bitcoin exchange rate can vary by tens or hundreds of dollars from one exchange to the next.  For example, approximately a week before bitcoin first crossed the $1,000 mark on Mt. Gox, the price of bitcoin had already reached the renminbi equivalent of $1,000 on China’s largest exchange, BTC China.  Following the recent announcement by Chinese authorities that banks would no longer be able to transact with bitcoin (which, in turn, triggered Baidu’s decision to suspend its acceptance of bitcoin), the price on 5th December as of 08:30 GMT had plummeted in China by a renminbi equivalent of approximately $177 more than prices on exchanges located outside of China (see Chart 1).  Large price variances triggered by sudden shocks in a relatively thinly-traded currency like bitcoin are not altogether surprising.  However, significant price variances across different exchange are also observed during longer periods of time which feature lower overall levels of price volatility, as can be observed in Table 1.  Looking at data sourced from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) for just over a three-month period from late August through to early December, we can confirm significant price differences across the three index component exchanges (Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, and BTC-e) in both average and median price.*  The significantly higher average price, compared to the median, shows us there is evidence of outliers – meaning more extreme price variations across exchanges over relatively shorter periods of time.  However, Mt. Gox has still maintained double-digit median price variances with Bitstamp and BTC-e over the past three months, meaning price fragmentation is a persistent feature across exchanges, even during periods of relatively lower volatility.  Quantifying the Mt. Gox premium  A common refrain heard across the bitcoin community is that the price of bitcoins traded on Mt. Gox is typically higher than other exchanges.  It has been suggested that bitcoins trade at a premium on Mt. Gox due to the restrictions on some national currency withdrawals, meaning some Mt. Gox customers are having to purchase bitcoins to transfer account assets out of the exchange.  Due to the ‘Mt. Gox premium’ those eager to see the maximum current value of their digital wallets have, prior to China's bitcoin boom and BTC China's high prices, traditionally turned to Gox.  But, on average, just how much higher is the Mt. Gox price than other bitcoin exchanges?  Looking at the same three-month dataset, we can confirm that the average price on Mt. Gox is significantly higher than Bitstamp and BTC-e, at $21 and $34, respectively.  Furthermore, we can see that during the sample period Mt. Gox achieved an all-time price high which was greater than Bitstamp and BTC-e by $77 and $160, respectively.  Looking ahead  Should the bitcoin market continue to grow in the months and years ahead, it would be reasonable to expect a decline in price fragmentation across the various exchanges as trading volume and liquidity increase.  For the time being, however, relatively illiquid markets alongside the barriers which have been erected around and between the various bitcoin exchanges will continue to drive price fragmentation.  In other words, the law of one price may one day apply to bitcoin but not for the foreseeable future.  * The CoinDesk Price Index uses minute-by-minute data sourced directly from the exchanges. While bitcoin prices can often vary significantly over smaller units of time (seconds) it is unlikely that the observed variance would be significantly impacted or eliminated with higher frequency data.
