42397202,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXW4,1374072633,Altcoins to take centre stage at Feathercoin meetup in Oxford,"A Feathercoin meetup is being held in a pub in Oxford, England, this weekend, giving those interested in the digital currency the chance to meet the team behind it.  The event is taking place at The Oxford Blue on 20th July from 3:00pm. Among the attendees will be founder of Feathercoin Peter Bushnell, who worked as head of IT at Oxford University’s Brasenose College for 10 years. He will lead an open discussion about digital currency and how it can benefit both consumers and merchants.  Chris Murray, owner of the Oxford Blue, said he's been ""fascinated"" with altcoins since he first learned about bitcoin back in 2010.  ""I'm really looking forward to having a chance to meet with some of the people actually working on the framework of one of these currencies, and discussing the requirements of a small business end-user like myself in terms of being able to seamlessly take payments in altcoins,"" he added.  Members of the Feathercoin forum have put a web-based payment system together for the event so attendees will be able to pay for their drinks using the cryptocurrency. To use the web app, staff members have to type in the amount of the bill and this will generate a QR code on the till.  ""We have an open source point of sale system, which is a Java-based platform, so the Feathercoin team are going to look at giving us an option on the till that means you just hit a button and it will print out a bill with a QR code on it,"" said Murray.  He went on to say that one of the things he would like to discuss at the meeting is the possibility of generating a label or ID for each transaction:  ""If you have a busy bar where lots of people are paying in Feathercoin, how do you know the transaction that just arrived was from the person you're serving and not someone at the other end of the bar? A transaction ID would solve this problem.""  Murray said one of the reasons he's interested in accepting digital currency is because he's fed up of the ""ridiculous"" amount he is charged each month to accept payment by card.  ""Payment process fees are up to 2% on some transactions and the card terminals cost about £20-£30 per month too. On top of this, it takes three days for the payment processors to actually send us the money, so not only do they charge you a large fee, they then just sit on your money.""  The owner said his pub has a mixed clientele, including some regular locals and students as well as those just visiting the city. He believes there could be quite a few students in the city who are involved in digital currency and mining – especially those who live in halls and do not have to pay their own electricity bills.  ""I was trying to work out the figures the other day and I think, with a normal graphics card, you can currently mine the equivalent of two pints a week. Which is obviously quite appealing to students!"" He added.  Those intending to attend the event are encouraged to RSVP on the Feathercoin events page.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/17/altcoins-to-take-centre-stage-at-feathercoin-meetup-in-oxford,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8645b3664c4beb861151a0961b06837779ad63d8-992x991.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397211,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXdw,1374064999,Inside Butterfly Labs: The challenges of producing bitcoin mining hardware,"CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey recently visited and toured the facilities at Butterfly Labs, one of the most prominent and written about producers of bitcoin mining technology. In this first part of this series, he reports on how they've tried to manage customer expectations and why they stay away from mining themselves.  “We understand that we didn’t deliver on time, you know? We take responsibility for what we’ve done”. I nod as I’m listening to Jeff Ownby, who is the VP of marketing for Butterfly Labs in the company’s conference room at their headquarters near Kansas City.  Indeed, Butterfly Labs admits that they’ve made mistakes in the past, but they want to move forward and I get the sense that they really want to do right by their customers. “Bitcoin has grown from a forum realm to a business realm,"" Ownby tells me. ""I think we're past the 'BFL is a scam' thing at this point. We're in this for the long haul"".  Meeting expectations  It has been written with a fair amount of frequency that Butterfly Labs had been unable to meet the expectations of its early customers. Indeed, CoinDesk has written about the company with a degree of mystique as its ASIC hardware began to appear. Many of BFL's customers put down a significant amount of money to preorder hardware, expecting to be at the forefront of the ASIC mining revolution.  Butterfly Labs aimed to be one of the first companies to offer ASIC bitcoin mining hardware, but problems with their chip designers resulted in deadlines slipping. In that time, organizations like Avalon were able to ship ASIC hardware and to also supply OEM chips for other manufacturers.  This meant Butterfly Labs received a lot of attention in the bitcoin and mining communities, and much of that has been critical and negative. Some don’t even believe that Butterfly Labs is a real company. But I can tell you, from the moment I contacted them to ultimately seeing their facility, it’s all very real.  Butterfly Labs headquarters  The Butterfly Labs HQ is bustling with employees, over 35 of them I'm told. Customer service, assembly and logistics are all run from the facility.  “We’re shipping about 300 units a day, but we’d like to be doing more”, Butterfly Labs Chief Operating Officer Josh Zerlan tells me. We’re standing in the back of their facility in a suburb south of Kansas City. This is the warehouse portion of their headquarters, and it is chock full of boxes from floor to ceiling. A forklift is parked off to the side. The executives tell me that they need more warehouse space, and are thinking about using a tractor-trailer temporarily in one of the cargo bays to make more room.  They share the building with a general contractor company and are currently in talks about possibly taking over and occupying the entire building. It doesn’t take much to realize that this company is outgrowing its office. When you are the first to be commercially selling bitcoin mining hardware to the public, you’d have to be. Bitcoin is getting big, and mining is one of the best ways to get involved.  One of the easier methods of getting in involved in bitcoin mining is to purchase a $274 BFL Jalapeno model, a tiny cubed device that can mine at 5 gigahashes per second. I watched as the entry-level Jalapeno was put together. There was no soldering involved; it was more of an assembly process. The ASIC PCB board was laid down in the chassis first, followed by the heat sink.  Then the fan was put in place, with the wiring snaking around the heat sink. Then a few screws tightened the whole cube into one little box. The components come from all over; from China, Chicago and the west coast, to be assembled and tested in this facility.  The shifting hardware landscape of bitcoin  The bitcoin network has gone through a hardware evolution. This is going to continue – and more on that in the second piece in this series – but it has moved over the past few years through several different technologies. It used to be that you could use PC CPUs to process the computational problems that are required for the bitcoin network to operate. As well as sophisticated setups with multiple graphics cards, there was also FPGAs that could mine more efficiently.  Today, we’re in the ASIC era. ASIC stands for application-specific integrated circuit. That means Butterfly Labs - among others like Avalon - have developed chips that specifically solve SHA256 cryptographic problems needed for the proof of work to mine new and process existing bitcoins. That’s what their chip was built for, and unlike GPUs, that’s all it does.  Mining vs production  Many have said that Butterfly Labs has an interesting business model. It has been pointed out by some people that BFL is selling mining hardware when they could just use their own equipment to mine bitcoins.  But they were clear with me that their goal is to supply the technology, and not to be a mining company. I asked them about their hosting services that they offer for equipment to be stored in datacenters around the Kansas City area for a fee with hardware services provided by BFL. They told me specifically that was all being done by a third-party company in the business of datacenter hosting. They would service warranties and make repairs, but nothing else.  And as for the information that the media was getting special treatment in getting BFL units, I got none as a writer for CoinDesk. When I asked about a 25 G/H Single unit that I had ordered, I was told I’d be waiting, just like everyone else. On a deep level, I felt pretty good that BFL was doing the right thing by getting through their backlog as orders have come in.  We’re in Zerlan, the COO’s office, talking about mining. In the corner behind his chair I see a modified Mini Rig SC top end unit with the chassis split open. It’s emanating some kind of red glow that gives the impression that it is some sort of futuristic mining prototype. I don’t even ask what its for, expecting that information on a machine like that wouldn’t be shared with this writer. I was also afraid that my mind might be bitcoin blown.  Zerlan is flying a small remote controlled helicopter around his office, shooting projectiles from the airborne machine into a wall. He says it’s a gift from one of Butterfly Labs’ customers. I can understand why: once you obtain some of their mining gear and start making some bitcoins, you’re going to be one happy customer. Time can heal the past, and it seems that Butterfly Labs is acutely aware of this.  Up next, part two: How BFL sees the future of ASIC bitcoin mining, how it affects bitcoin price, the arms race between hardware manufacturers, and more exclusive images from inside Butterfly Labs.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/17/inside-butterfly-labs-the-challenges-of-producing-bitcoin-mining-hardware,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6632152d812360e2a3967922e72c456d8fb56e8-653x292.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397204,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXaz,1374049280,Bitcoinkit.framework to power Grabhive and other OSX/iOS Bitcoin apps,"A new bitcoin-focused development framework for Mac and iOS developers has been announced. The framework, called BitcoinKit.Framework, is open source and provides an application programming interface (API) to developers. This will in turn speed up development time of bitcoin apps for Apple products.  For those who have never written a computer program, a framework is essentially an extension to an established programming language. It does so by providing a library of functions that are not part of the original language, but perform regularly used tasks for a given type of end product. It thus saves programmers from metaphorically reinventing the wheel.  If you're a developer interested in using this framework in your application, you can grab the source code from https://github.com/grabhive/BitcoinKit.  The real potential of this framework is that it opens the way to non-Java, i.e. natively coded, simple payment verification (SPV) clients. Java has been in the news a lot recently as it has suffered numerous security vulnerabilities, and Oracle has been pushing much more frequent updates in an attempt to keep things under control. Therefore, getting bitcoin applications away from that platform is desirable.  When asked by a user of the Bitcoin Forum about why they were not using the code offered by the Bitcoinj project (a Java implementation of the Bitcoin protocol), and instead replicating its abilities, the developer answered:  You're right, and we're well aware of this, but we're looking for a clean long-term solution. I'd say we're far from against trying to make bitcoinj work, but our resistance to that approach has more to do with the lack of a guaranteed JVM in Mac OS X. We could simply include it in the application package, but that is far indeed from ideal.  When asked whether SPV features would be added to the development framework, it was confirmed that such features are planned.  Yeah we absolutely plan to do this. We're either going to end up extending some of Jeff Garzik's work or write our own SPV wallet and include it in the bundle. We were pretty frustrated with the lack of non-Java options too. :/",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/17/bitcoinkitframework-to-power-grabhive-and-other-osxios-bitcoin-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a2a1d58963154d3e53852403258ec1bf8fdfb0e-500x313.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
