Using digital currencies synonymously with the term cryptocurrencies, a paper published by the Bank of Finland and written by one of its advisors argues that cryptocurrencies aren't real forms of money.  According to Aleksi Grym, the central bank's digitalization advisor, cryptocurrencies are ""not currencies at all but rather accounting systems for non-existent assets.""  The ""great illusion,"" he posits, results from how ""poorly understood the concept of money still is"" and the rather ""confusing choice of terminology"" featured in the original white paper authored by bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.  Zeroing in on the true functions of bitcoin, Grym draws parallels between how bitcoin works and how a traditional bank functions. First, with bitcoin, the accountants in a traditional bank are akin to the miners. Second, the centralized ledger held by banks to record account balances and transactions are akin to the bitcoin blockchain.  As Grym notes:  ""The only difference between a cryptocurrency system and a traditional ledger system is that in a cryptocurrency system the ledger is distributed across a network of computers, while a traditional bank maintains the ledger in a centralised computer system. There is, however, no practical difference in what the systems do.""  He goes on to add: ""Money, at its essence, is a unit of account."" So while cryptocurrencies may act as an excellent ""kind of financial record-keeping device comparable to an account book,"" it will neither replace the forms of money currently in existence nor ever become the singular form of money in existence without institutional backing.  Whether the Bank of Finland agrees with Grym is perhaps beside the point; back in 2014, the central bank classified bitcoin as a kind of commodity rather than a currency.  Yet the subject remains one of interest for the institution, having published multiple research papers that explore the multifaceted issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

Theresa Tetley, a former stockbroker and real estate investor based in California, was also fined $20,000 and will give up 40 bitcoins (an amount worth roughly $254,000), nearly $300,000 in cash and 25 assorted gold bars, according to a notice from the U.S. Department of Justice.  As CoinDesk previously reported, Tetley worked as a trader on the LocalBitcoins exchange platform under the name ""Bitcoin Maven"" between 2014 and 2017 and reportedly exchanged millions of dollars worth of crypto during that period.  The year-long sentence – plus one day – is less than the 30 months Tetley potentially faced as the sentencing process moved forward. It represents a win for Tetley, whose lawyers sought a one-year prison term.  Brian Klein, one of Tetley's attorneys, called the result ""a victory,"" according to LA Times, as it is much shorter than the previous 30-month jail time.  ""We are pleased the judge made such a dramatic departure,"" Klein told the publication.  Tetley's case is considered to be the first of its kind within California's Central District, but other lawsuits in the past couple of years have taken aim at U.S.-based traders who used the LocalBitcoins platform.  In one case from 2017, a bitcoin trader and his father were charged with running an unlawful money services business, resulting in a nine-year sentence for Michael Lord.

In a disclaimer recently added to the bottom of its homepage, the website said that ""by entering TPB you agree to [monero] being mined using your CPU. If you don't agree please leave now or install an adBlocker.""  That message comes months after the site's administrators wrote in a September blog post that they were testing a monero Javascript miner in an effort to, as they put it, ""get rid of all the ads.""  It was a controversial effort launched by an equally controversial website, which has drawn the ire of numerous national governments for its role in facilitating file-sharing online. Despite framing the test as limited in nature, many visitors cried foul as much of their computing power was harnessed for mining XMR. Bleeping Computer reported last October that Pirate Bay had brought back the feature.  The torrent site's new approach represents a kind of so-called ""cryptojacking"" that is voluntary in nature. Indeed, other organizations, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), have turned to the Coinhive open-source software as a source of revenue (though in that case, the revenues are destined for philanthropic causes).  Other instances of ""cryptojacking"" have been far more malicious in nature, including a wide-ranging attack this spring which targeted websites running the Drupal content management system.

The SEC originally alleged on July 2 that attorney T.J. Jesky and his law firm's business affairs manager Mark DeStefano had made about $1.4 million by selling stock shares in UBI Blockchain Internet, a Hong Kong-based firm, between Dec. 26, 2017 and Jan. 5, 2018.  As CoinDesk reported at the time, the two Nevada men allegedly sold 72,000 restricted shares at prices ranging from $21.12 to about $50, even though the shares were supposed to be sold at the fixed price of $3.70, as stated in the registration statement.  Sales of UBI Blockchain's stock then ceased as the SEC suspended trading activities on Jan. 5, due to questions regarding the company's public filings and unusual market activities around its stock, including a price spike.  ""Without admitting or denying"" the accusations in the SEC's complaint, Jesky and DeStefano have now agreed in a New York District court to settle the case by returning $1.4 million of the allegedly illegal earnings and a $188,682 civil penalty. They have also agreed to ""be subject to permanent injunctions"" on future stock trading.  According to the SEC notice, the investigation is still ongoing.

42429384,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxnPh,1531234273,"More Than Half of ICOs Fail Within 4 Months, Study Suggests","While over 4,000 ICO projects have managed to raise a combined total of around $12 billion to date – and most since January 2017 – a majority of them fail within four months of their token sales, a new study suggests.  The research, conducted by a small team at Boston College in Massachusetts, found that a mere 44.2 percent of token projects are active into the fifth month or beyond, using their social footprint via Twitter as a barometer of health.  While the figures are perhaps shocking, they should maybe be taken with a pinch of salt, as the methodology of the study leaves some wiggle-room for ICOs to exist beyond that 120-day time-frame and not be indicated so in the data.  In determining the lifespan of an ICO, the Boston College team – Hugo Benedetti and Leonard Kostovetsky – chose to use the intensity of Twitter posts to analyze the lifecycle of projects and assumed that no tweets in the fifth month meant that the project had died.  The paper further analyzes the data, suggesting that the safest bet would be for those ICOs that manage to list on exchanges after the token launch:  ""Breaking it down by category, 83% of the 694 ICOs that don't report capital and don't list on an exchange are inactive after 120 days. For the 420 ICOs that raise some capital but don't list, this figure falls to 52%, and for the 440 ICOs that list on an exchange, only 16% are inactive in the fifth month.""  Token returns  The study also looked at the value of ICOs as investments and the average returns over different time-frames, after adjusting for the overall moves in the value of the cryptocurrency markets.  Benedetti and Kostovetsky found that ""in contrast to IPOs, crypto-tokens continue to generate abnormal positive average returns after the ICO,"" with token values continuing to climb for six months after launching.  The paper states:  ""We find evidence of significant ICO underpricing, with average returns of 179% from the ICO price to the first day's opening market price, over a holding period that averages just 16 days. Even after imputing returns of -100% to ICOs that don't list their tokens within 60 days and adjusting for the returns of the asset class, the representative ICO investor earns 82%.""  Once trading has got underway, tokens continue to grow in price, the paper continues, ""generating average buy-and-hold abnormal returns of 48% in the first 30 trading days.""  Further, the researchers say: ""Startups sell their tokens during the ICO at a significant discount to the opening market price, generating an average return for ICO investors of 179%, accrued over an average holding period of 16 days from the ICO end date to the listing date.""  While the figures may be hard to parse for the non-academic reader, Kostovetsky told Bloomberg that ""once you go beyond three months, at most six months, they don't outperform other cryptocurrencies.""  ""The strongest return is actually in the first month,"" he added.  The paper concluded that, though the figures could indicate bubbles around token launches, they also indicate that there can be high rewards for those that accept the risk of investing in ""unproven pre-revenue platforms through unregulated offerings.""

42429388,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxnbh,1531224086,100 Merchants Can Now Trial Bitcoin's Lightning Network Risk Free,"A few lucky merchants now have one less obstacle to accepting bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, payment processing startup CoinGate is opening up a pilot program that will allow 100 merchants to trial a Lightning-enabled version of its service, one which taps into the open-source tech meant to make bitcoin transactions fast and cheap.  As with CoinGate's standard service, the company will handle the finer details of crypto-to-fiat exchange, however, the new pilot has the benefit of covering the costs should funds be lost due to the early-stage nature of the software (lightning implementations are now largely in beta).  And while most experts believe the network still isn't ready to support significant commercial transactions, CoinGate CTO Rytis Bieliauskas thinks there's a greater good that will be achieved in being among the first to test the waters.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It's a very new technology. Inevitably there will be some bugs, either in our implementation or in the Lightning Network. It will help, not just us, but the whole community because the bugs we find might help the whole protocol.""  Although Lightning invoices are typically limited by the protocol itself to 0.042 bitcoin each, or under $300 according to current prices, CoinGate CCO Vilius Semenas told CoinDesk there's no established limit to how many invoices CoinGate will reimburse if funds are lost.  At least for the time being, few shoppers have the resources to send cryptocurrency from a Lightning wallet such as Zap. But this pilot could test whether Lightning actually tackles some of the issues that deter mainstream merchants from prioritizing crypto payments in the first place.  For example, bitcoin's latency presents an issue for CoinGate clients like the Luxembourg-based adult content platform LiveJasmin.  ""Instant payments are the most important from our point of view,"" Tamás Szerencse, head of payments at LiveJasmin, said, expanding on why the company joined CoinGate's Lightning pilot.  With up to 40 million daily visitors, LiveJasmin could become one of the biggest mainstream merchants to experiment with Lightning so far. Experimenting with more diverse transaction types could provide invaluable insight into how Lightning works out in the wild.  Learning from experiments  As such, CoinGate is emerging as one of a small, but growing number of crypto payment processors to take the leap. (Last week GloBee helped crypto hardware wallet accessory provider CryptoCloaks accept its first payment.)  Still, most acknowledge there's still a long way to go until mainstream merchants could safely use Lightning.  Steve Beauregard, the founder of the payment processor GoCoin, told CoinDesk he agreed with Bieliauskas that layered networks might be able to reduce friction for recurring payments, but he acknowledged the tech is still in its infancy, which is likely to limit shoppers.  ""It's still very complicated for an average end-user to use it [Lightning],"" Beauregard said. ""I think the ones that benefit the most would be international merchants that are trying to accept payments from overseas.""  The majority of merchants who applied for this pilot were businesses like collectibles maker Bitgild, which offers silver and gold coins engraved with QR codes for real cryptocurrency, catering to clients who are already fascinated by Lightning experiments.  Beyond cross-border payments, Bieliauskas argued Lightning-enabled transactions could soon provide a cheaper option than credit cards for merchants dealing with micropayments or payments worth a fraction of a penny.  For now, Beauregard said the primary value such Lightning pilots offer is an opportunity to participate in experimental research.  Speaking to that point, renowned Lightning developer Alex Bosworth agreed this pilot will provide a learn opportunity for the whole network. Lightning's most useful features for merchants are still in development.  Bosworth told CoinDesk:  ""In the future, one nice thing about Lightning merchants is that if they invoice you in one currency and the payer wants to pay in a different currency, that will be possible.""

42429377,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxnFh,1531222210,PBoC Will 'Crush' Foreign ICOs Targeting Chinese Investors: Official,"A vice governor of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has again issued strong statements against initial coin offerings (ICOs), singling out those that have moved overseas, but are still marketing to investors in China.  Speaking at an internal meeting of the Internet Finance Rectification Working Group on Monday, Pan Gongsheng reiterated that ICOs, ""disguised"" ICOs and crypto asset trading are illegal in the country, and represent illicit forms of fundraising and securities issuance.  Although China issued an outright ban on ICOs in September 2017, Pan said a lot of the projects that moved overseas as a result are still making themselves available in the Chinese market, according to a report from local business media source Yicai.  Pan was quoted as saying:  ""Any new financial product or phenomenon that is not authorized under the existing legal framework, we will crush them as soon as they dare to surface.""  Authorized by China's State Council in 2016, the working group is tasked with executing financial regulators' directions for controlling illegal activities in the sphere of internet finance.  The report did not offer details on how the body intends to curb access to foreign ICOs and crypto trading. However, the news was followed by an item from another state-owned media source indicating that China's messaging giant WeChat appears to have increased its efforts to spot cryptocurrency traders using the platform over recent months.  The later report suggested the messaging service had restricted its payments function of such users – for instance, by limiting the fiat currency they can receive on any day. In January, Pan notably pushed for wider cryptocurrency trading ban in China according to an internal memo circulated at the time.  WeChat is not the only service platform that appears to have taken steps to cooperate with regulators.  After the 2017 ICO ban, one online forum called Zhishi Xingqiu (""Knowledge Planet"" in literal translation) became a popular platform used by agents from outside China to access retail investors in the country, for a fee making investments on their behalf.  In March, however, the platform issued a statement saying that it would monitor threads and ban those who use the platform to solicit investors in ICO tokens.

The leading cryptocurrency looked vulnerable to a pullback 24 hours ago, courtesy of the signs of bullish exhaustion near key resistance of $6,800. Hence, the drop to $6436 seen today is not surprising, but has certainly boosted the odds of a close (as per UTC) below the all-important 10-day moving average (MA).  It is worth noting that the short-term moving average is still biased to the bulls (rising). So, as discussed yesterday, a strong defense of the 10-day MA support would reinforce the short-term bullish outlook and could yield a rally to $7,000.  As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,460 on Bitfinex – down 5.5 percent from the high of $6,839 reached over the weekend.  Daily chart  The daily candle has already breached the 10-day MA support of $6,585, however, only a close today (as per UTC) below that level would abort the short-term bullish view put forward by the bullish RSI divergence and the falling channel breakout last week.  That said, the probability of BTC closing below the 10-day MA is quite high as the short duration charts have already turned bearish.  4-hour chart  The rising channel breakdown indicates the corrective rally from the June 24 low of $5,755 has ended.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has turned bearish (below 50.00). Meanwhile, BTC has also breached the support of 200-candle MA. Clearly, the bears must be feeling emboldened  View  The bearish breakdown on the 4-hour chart indicates BTC could test the 50-candle MA, currently located at $6,381, and could close below the 10-day MA today, confirming a short-term bullish invalidation.  Acceptance below $6,381 (50-candle MA) would expose 6,000 (February low and major psychological support).  The bulls may build steam for a fresh move higher towards $7,000 if BTC closes above 10-day MA today.

The sudden departure comes as the result of an ongoing internet feud between Li and Chen Weixing, a venture capitalist who in recent months has made a series of hostile comments in public against the investor.  Li announced his resignation on his Weibo account on Monday night, saying he made the decision in order to preserve the reputation of the government-backed blockchain investment fund launched in April of this year.  He wrote:  ""The series of defamations from Chen Weixing against myself has brought material and negative impacts on the reputation of Xiong'An Blockchain Fund. … To let the Hangzhou government continue its push for blockchain development, I will resign from my role as a managing partner.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, back in June, Chen openly described Li as a ""fraud"" and a ""tumor"" of the cryptocurrency industry. He later alleged that Li owed a group of investors 30,000 bitcoin that he had collected in 2013 for an investment fund, but could not repay since he had gambled away the assets.  Li later responded with detailed explanations to each of Chen's accusations, but the spat did not end there. Things soon sparked off again as an obscenity-laden recording of a private meeting between Li and several individuals was leaked through social media on July 3, stirring up controversy within the Chinese cryptocurrency community.  In the 50-minute chat, recorded in January, Li took aim at various individuals and companies within the industry, calling Qtum's co-founder Shuai Chu a ""spin doctor,"" Binance exchange a ""cheating"" platform and Softbank a ""stupid fool"" for investing in Ripple.  Chen went public again following the audio leak, accusing Li of being a ""foul-mouthed liar."" He further questioned the legality of the Xiong'An Blockchain Fund, asking whether the local government has indeed allocated the apparently promised 30 percent of the funds.  Then, last Friday, Li announced through his WeChat channel that he had filed a lawsuit with a local court in Hangzhou accusing Chen of defamation. He went on to say that Chen has no knowledge of blockchain and can only make his name by defaming others.  Chen responded on Weibo that he believes the lawsuit will turn out to be his chance to take on Li in court and calling for ""victims"" to join him.

42394020,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsc3sL,1531210935,R3 Launches Corda Enterprise With First-Ever 'Blockchain Firewall',"More than a year in the making, Corda Enterprise has arrived.  Announced Tuesday, blockchain startup R3 has released a paid version of its signature open-source Corda blockchain technology, one that offers added features aimed at regulated institutions including 24/7 support, disaster recovery and more.  The big reveal comes just over 13 months after R3 raised $107 million, at the time stating that it would allocate funds for an enhanced version of its product. Further, it will bring to end a period of development in which businesses have needed to build on top of R3's open-source code, dedicating internal staff and resources.  Still, while a step for R3, it's perhaps the features that will drive most of the conversation. As part of the commercial rollout of its Corda Enterprise platform, blockchain startup R3 is touting such advances as the ""first-ever Blockchain Application Firewall.""  Not a traditional firewall, the term denotes how Corda is able to limit communication between blockchain nodes operating in different environments, and with different informational needs from their network. For example, many Corda users, the company says, own highly secured data centres, running their existing infrastructure behind firewalls  A possible barrier to interoperability, R3 CTO Richard Gendal Brown said his team saw the possibility to ""achieve the best of both worlds"" by allowing as much connectivity as needed between Corda nodes running in closed and open environments.  Brown told CoinDesk:  ""There is this dilemma, because blockchain nodes need to be able to connect to the core systems of a firm, but also need to be able to connect to other nodes across the network [and in] very complex networking architectures.""  The firewall, therefore, ""protects the Corda node from the outside whilst allowing through just the traffic that should come through,"" Brown said.  As such, it's expected to be a key driver of uptake at a time when R3, which was reported to be running out of money, also seems to be building a creative open source community.  ""We are at the point where the first I often hear of a Corda usage is when the project issues a press release, or we see questions on our Slack channel,"" said Brown.  A novel breakthrough  As such, R3 and Brown are touting the Blockchain Firewall as a feature that should make Corda more appealing to businesses when compared to traditional open-source blockchains (for which such features would need to be custom created).  Existing blockchains, Brown says, are either deployed in standalone solutions with one application and network without any future interoperability and asset mobility, or what they are managing is not actually core to the institution.  The way it works is part of an Enterprise Corda node is allowed to sit outside of the network in what Brown compared to a kind of ""demilitarized zone"" that is visible to the internet.  ""That tiny locked-down piece is massively secured in the demilitarized zone and then it alone has a tiny umbilical cord that allows the data to flow back in and out of the firm,"" said Brown. ""That separation of the nodes into those two pieces is the Blockchain Corda Firewall and we think it will be transformational.""  Not just a value-add for customers, though, the implications for R3 are also clear.  As the consortium progressed along the road to commercial distribution, one of the overarching motivations was to ensure interoperability with Corda open source as the ecosystem expands, enabling the system to achieve the kind of network effect of more open blockchains.  A new kind of network  But if such a move to more strongly consider interoperability seems premature, Brown counters the time is now for such considerations.  Returning to the question of interoperability, Brown predicts the enterprise blockchain market will soon consolidate down to a small number of platforms, escalating the need that these remaining systems can interchange data.  In this way, Corda, Brown argues, can interoperate in multiple ways, both between its own open source and enterprise deployments, as well as with other platforms, citing ongoing work with Hyperledger as an example of this.  As the market matures, he goes so far as to suggest that clients will not tolerate vendors selling them forks of open-source platforms that can't interoperate.  ""If I deploy a set of Corda nodes over to the left and then deploy a set of Corda nodes over to the right, it would be a tragedy if they couldn't interoperate with each other,"" said Brown.  In this way, Brown suggested the news might also serve as a wake-up call for institutions, who have built with technologies that might not be able to make the leap when the time comes.

42429382,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxnNh,1531209716,Augur Is Live: Decentralized Prediction Market Launches After 2-Year Beta,"Augur is finally live.  The decentralized platform for betting on real-world predictions was one of the first applications built on top of the ethereum blockchain, and its creators sold ""reputation"" (REP) tokens for over $5 million in 2015 – a time when few were talking about ""ICOs"" or ""utility coins."" A public beta version of the platform came out the following year, and its team published a revised version of its white paper in January.  Now, the Forecast Foundation, the not-for-profit behind Augur's development, has announced the launch of the long-awaited platform, which was accompanied by the release of the final version of the Augur application as open-source software.  The years-long delay in reaching this point may have been frustrating for token holders, but it has allowed the Augur team to aggressively vet their code through internal audits and a generous bug bounty program. Notably, Augur offered $200,000 for bugs that qualified as ""critical"" (though the team hasn't announced any rewards larger than $5,000).  The project has good reasons for being so circumspect.  As Tom Kysar, operations lead at the Forecast Foundation (which was created to support Augur), told CoinDesk in February:  ""We'll probably be the largest and most complex application to be attempted to be deployed on ethereum.""  At the same time, he added, ""Once Augur is live on the mainnet"" – that is, once it's live on the ethereum blockchain – ""we have no more control over Augur than anyone else does.""  So, the risk that a serious vulnerability could cripple a complex decentralized application like Augur aren't just academic. After all, the entire DAO saga – ICO, launch, hack, ethereum fork and ensuing divisions – unfolded in the time between Augur's token sale and its launch.  How it works  Augur allows participants to bet on anything.  As long as the outcome can be verified in the real world, users can create a prediction market for anything from ether's price, an election in Brazil or the outcome of Iceland v. Argentina in the World Cup.  What distinguishes Augur from a traditional betting market is that no single party sits in the middle, meaning that users are likely to pay lower prices.  Removing the centralized intermediary from a betting market presents a problem, however: how to bring dispersed, financially interested parties into agreement about the actual outcome of the predicted event?  In Augur's system, the creator of a prediction market designates a ""reporter"" to vet the outcome. This designated entity puts down a deposit of REP tokens, which they lose if they incorrectly report the outcome and other REP holders challenge them. The reporter is compensated through fees.  Day-to-day betting is not done in REP, but in ether, the native token of the ethereum blockchain (though, eventually, the plan is to support other ethereum-based tokens). Users can buy and sell shares in particular predictions, which are priced according to the likelihood the market attaches to each outcome.  More than just cheap bets  Augur's white paper argueshttps://github.com/AugurProject/whitepaper/blob/master/english/whitepaper.pdf that fees on the platform will go ""as low as market forces can drive them,"" providing those placing bets with an attractive alternative to current offerings.  The platform will also likely be difficult for governments to block or censor if, as Kysar argued, no single party is in control of it – even the Forecast Foundation. That could make Augur appealing in jurisdictions where sports gambling is illegal, for example.  Augur's creators see it as more than just a rival to gaming sites such as Paddy Power, though. The project's website suggests its usefulness for forecasting – whether elections or quarterly product sales – and hedging against high-impact, low-likelihood events such as natural disasters.  Forecast Foundation co-founder and senior developer Joey Krug summed up the team's ambition last year, when he wrote:  ""If Bitcoin gave us decentralized currency and Ethereum brought decentralized computation, Augur will enable a decentralized financial system.""  Another CryptoKitties?  Before Augur can overhaul the global financial system, though, it has to attract users.  Kyle Samani, co-founder and managing partner of the cryptocurrency investment fund Multicoin Capital – which he said does not currently own any REP tokens, but is following the project closely – told CoinDesk that the Augur team wants a ""slow and steady"" launch – nothing ""loud [and] crazy.""  ""Not sure how much demand there will be,"" he continued, given that ""they are not doing mainstream consumer marketing.""  That said, if demand does materialize, Augur could put considerable strain on ethereum, according to Corey Miller, an investment analyst at cryptocurrency investment firm BlockTower Capital.  Echoing Kysar, Miller said Augur would be ""the most complicated dapp to ever launch on ethereum.""  But he added:  ""Ethereum doesn't handle complicated so well.""  In Miller's view, even modest demand for Augur could lead to a situation similar to the one caused by CryptoKitties at the height of its popularity, when the ethereum network slowed to a crawl and transactions became inordinately expensive.  In other words, the launch could turn out to be loud and crazy after all.

According to a report from Israeli media outlet Calcalistech on Sunday, the new investment arm, called Benson Oak Ventures, has already secured $25 million and aims to reach the $100 million target by the end of 2018.  The new venture's capital will come from private investors and family offices, and will exclude institutional investors, the report said. With a focus on seed-stage blockchain and consumer-facing startups, Benson Oak said in the report it anticipates to release the names of two portfolio companies in the coming days.  According to Benson Oak Ventures' website, the fund will be interested primarily in blockchain startups offering consumer products or creating platforms that enable community growth, all in an effort to boost blockchain's use at the consumer level.  While the site of a thriving blockchain startup scene, several of the more major initiatives in Israel are being driven by large financial institutions that focus more on a business-to-business setting.

42429389,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxndh,1531195511,BitGo Adds 57 Ethereum Tokens In Largest-Ever Custody Service Expansion,"The wider world of crypto tokens is becoming a bit more accessible to institutional investors.  The security startup BitGo exclusively told CoinDesk on Tuesday, July 10, it will expand its suite of custody products and services to support 57 new ethereum assets, a move driven by demand for services that safeguard private keys – the alphanumeric strings that act as passwords for crypto assets – and that, once lost, are gone forever.  As such, the move is a telling one for the blockchain security sector, one that showcases how it's in the midst of a changing competitive landscape.  Founded in 2013, BitGo has become an industry leader managing wallets at crypto exchanges, but to date, its service has been limited to larger protocols like bitcoin and ethereum. (Indeed, the overall lack of options has even led traditional custodians like BNY Mellon, JPMorgan and Northern Trust to consider the business, sources told Bloomberg in June.)  The startup is hardly the only industry upstart rushing to debut institutional custody services – U.S. exchange provider Coinbase, the Swiss startup Smart Valor and Japanese bank Nomura are just three of the companies rolling out licensed crypto storage solutions.  Yet the addition of ethereum tokens could be a key first-move advantage. According to BitGo CTO Benedict Chan, there has been a surge in demand for custody solutions for alternative crypto assets such as the kind it's now adding.  Benedict Chan, CTO of BitGo, told CoinDesk:  ""These institutions, they generally don't want to self-manage their coins. They are looking for someone that can support multiple coins.""  Timothy Furey, CFA and head of banking at Satis Group, a firm focused on advising institutions on ICO investments, described this blockchain industry trend as an ""arms race"" to offer institutional-grade custody solutions for a spectrum of assets.  That's why VP of product marketing, Robin Verderosa, said BitGo is now looking to obtain a BitLicense in New York and a qualified custodian license in South Dakota. BitGo aims to offer even more custodial services, adding more than 100 cryptocurrencies by the end of 2018.  Verderosa said courting institutional investors has become BitGo's priority, adding:  ""What we've learned is that they're interested in investing in a basket of coins and tokens that kind of help hedge the market and give better returns.""  Token roulette  Equally notable to the potential industry impact, though, is how BitGo is taking steps to ensure the quality of its service given the risks inherent in dealing with smaller cryptocurrencies.  When BitGo debuts support for dozens of cryptos today, it will include those offered by Kin by the chat messaging app Kik, several native tokens for decentralized crypto exchanges and the blockchain identity crypto Civic, a startup BitGo began experimenting with in 2017.  It's a reality that's had an impact operationally, as product manager Isaac Eleftheriadis now heads an 11-person BitGo team focused on rising cryptocurrencies and tokens.  According to Eleftheriadis, every token added in this first batch was explicitly requested by BitGo's institutional clients. Once there's an obvious demand for custody options, the team researches this token to make sure its issuers and founding team are reputable.  Long after adding basic storage features, support for crypto tokens requires ongoing vigilance.  ""An added challenge for custodians who are coming to market is figuring out how they will handle issues like airdrops, hard forks, etc, and which ones they will support. This presents real technical challenges in addition to regulatory and tax-related ones,"" said Arianna Simpson, former BitGo employee and current founder of the crypto investment fund Autonomous Partners.  Speaking to this point, Eleftheriadis told CoinDesk his team actively monitors whether token issuers are planning code changes, in addition to quarterly security evaluations.  Some token issuers themselves have also become BitGo clients.  ""There's been cases were customers asked us to support their ERC-20 token,"" Eleftheriadis said. ""They don't want to do the ICO yet until all their tokens can be held by BitGo.""  Other security efforts  Aside from BitGo, there are several startups in the race to serve institutional crypto investors.  Smart Valor CEO Olga Feldmeier spearheads one such provider, a licensed investment platform which also offers custody and management services. She agreed with Chan that many high net-worth individuals and institutions would prefer a licensed expert handle storage and security.  That's why Smart Valor is partnering with the hardware wallet maker Ledger to offer on-site storage of private keys and other services comparable with deposits at a bank. This Swiss platform for managing and trading tokenized assets is scheduled to launch in September, around the same time as Smart Valor's ICO.  ""A lot of family offices are starting to think about investing directly in ICOs and protocol tokens,"" Feldmeier said. ""The custody solution is extremely important because all the hacks so far, everything that happened until now, it was all hacks of exchanges.""  Chan said ethereum tokens, in particular, are prone to issues caused by bugs in smart contracts. Regardless of Feldmeier's point that most breaches involve exchanges, hackers exploited such a smart contract bug in 2017 to steal $30 million worth of ethereum tokens from Parity wallet users.  A seasoned investor, Simpson referred to security practices for crypto tokens as ""a moving target."" Especially in this space, the devil hides in those details.  Luckily for institutional investors, startups like BitGo and Smart Valor are prioritizing secure custody for tokens, not just bitcoin.  Chan concluded:  ""There's a lot of different events that have happened because of smart contract bugs. So, we try to be on the safer side there.""
