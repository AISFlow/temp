42376665,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6be5Z,1384462198,New York state is considering issuing 'BitLicenses' to bitcoin businesses,"The term 'BitLicense' has officially entered into the lexicon of virtual currency terminology. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is considering issuing such a framework in order to regulate distributed electronic money such as bitcoin.  The department, which is planning on holding an upcoming hearing regarding virtual currencies at an as-yet-unspecified date, expects to bring up the possibility of licensing the business of virtual currency money transmission. In August, it subpoenaed 22 bitcoin-related companies requesting information about the way in which they operate.  ""Our public hearing will review the interconnection between money transmission regulations and virtual currencies,"" a document released by NYDFS titled 'Notice of Intent to Hold Hearing on Virtual Currencies', dated November 14, 2013, states.  ""Additionally, the hearing is also expected to consider the possibility and feasibility of NYDFS issuing a ‘BitLicense’ specific to virtual currency transactions and activities, which would include anti-money laundering and consumer protection requirements for licensed entities.""  The department is in a state where a large number of financial transactions occur since it in the jurisdiction of the US banking epicenter of New York City. Its location could, as a result, make it one of the leading regulatory bodies that may surface as a result of the booming value of bitcoin's price.  ""It is important for regulators to balance both allowing new technologies and industries to flourish, while also working to ensure that consumers and our country’s national security remain protected,"" the letter states.  One of the biggest draws for illegal activity, the black marketplace Silk Road, was shut down in early October. Yet alternatives have still operated, and a new Silk Road has also surfaced, creating a whack-a-mole type scenario regarding illicit exchanges for authorities to deal with.  ""NYDFS launched its inquiry in part because of evidence that the cloak of anonymity provided by virtual currencies has helped support dangerous criminal activity, such as drug smuggling, money laundering, gun running, and child pornography.  In addition to the booming price of bitcoin, a number of scams and cases of fraud have cropped up in the past few weeks, clearly drawing the attention of law enforcement and regulators.  ""Virtual currencies may have a number of legitimate commercial purposes, including the facilitation of financial transactions. That said, NYDFS also believes that it is in the long-term interest of the virtual currency industry to put in place appropriate guardrails that protect consumers, root out illegal activity, and safeguard our national security.""  ""I think we should applaud the intention to develop specifically-tailored requirements for digital currency businesses, but we should be skeptical given New York's scattershot, undiscriminating approach to its recent subpoena campaign,"" said Marco Santori, Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation's Regulatory Affairs Committee.  The timing of the hearing is still opaque, but the regulatory body is making it clear there will be serious talks regarding virtual currencies in the near future.  ""As the next step in our inquiry, we are providing notice that NYDFS intends to hold a public hearing on virtual currency regulation in New York City in the coming months at a time and location to be determined. We will announce logistical details for the hearing in the near future.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/14/new-york-state-is-considering-issuing-bitlicenses-to-bitcoin-businesses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db4c078f491c65548a0cd0cdd10be1859493f74f-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376680,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beLv,1384446632,Bitcoin in the UK: HMRC suggests bitcoins are 'taxable vouchers',"Bitcoin faces many hurdles before it may become an everyday currency. For businesses, one of these hurdles is the uncertainty surrounding its tax status.  Across Europe, sales tax is known as Value Added Tax (VAT). When a nation begins to charge tax against bitcoin, many may interpret it as acceptance.  However, it's possible that the application of VAT could serve to kill bitcoin too.  Private money  When news broke earlier this year that Germany was regarding bitcoin as ""private money"", many rejoiced because it was the first time a European country had laid down any rules about bitcoin at all.  The tax situation there still remains uncertain, though. While it's clear that Germany excludes bitcoin from capital gains tax after the first year of possession, the original article published in De Welt makes no definite reference as to how sales tax would be handled.  Because tax laws are harmonised across the European economic area, the German case is being watched by many.  A good  The status of bitcoin as a currency, or not, and the consequent application of tax law may lead to a chilling effect on the adoption of bitcoin.  For example, consider this anecdote about Swedish VAT on the Bitcoin Forum. Here the post claims that bitcoin is regarded as a good, not a currency in its own right.  Therefore, VAT is applicable to the whole volume of a trade in bitcoin.  Note that the case for fiat currency conversion is that VAT is not changed on the volume of the trade, but only on the service charge.  In the UK, businesses only have to register for VAT collection once its turnover reaches £79,000 (for this tax year).  For a business looking to setup as a bitcoin exchange, the matter of whether bitcoin is regarded as a currency or a good makes a critical difference.  A voucher  As Tom Gullen described on his blog, Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) seems to be classifying bitcoins as vouchers, which means VAT would be due on any sales.  A 20% mark-up on bitcoin prices would make UK exchanges untenable. In addition to Gullen's statement, an independent source told us that HMRC had given them the same classification.  We also spoke to Dr Tom Robinson of the UK-based bitcoin exchange BitPrice and consulting firm Blockchain Consulting, who recently attended the Financial Innovators Summit at 10 Downing Street.  At the time, it was said that he ""left the meeting feeling largely optimistic"".  However, his subsequent communications yielded the following statement from HMRC: ""Our Policy teams' view is that these are not currency. It is our view that the provision of bitcoins is the sale of vouchers. These are likely to be 'single purpose' vouchers.""  Inappropriate classification  Robinson said: ""This is obviously an entirely inappropriate classification for bitcoin: they aren't issued by anyone, they don't have a 'face value' and they can be redeemed for a wide range of goods and services.""  He added:    ""I have heard anecdotal evidence of at least one bitcoin trader in the UK having received a VAT demand from HMRC, relating to bitcoin they have sold.      This is one of the key things that we have been addressing with HM Treasury. It obviously stems from a misunderstanding of what bitcoin is and hopefully can be remedied fairly easily.""    Robinson also posted to reddit, saying: ""We do now have a commitment from the Treasury that they will seriously consider how bitcoin might achieve official recognition in the UK. In doing this the government is seeking input from bitcoin businesses.""  Any businesses that want to submit a comment should do so through this link.  HMRC told CoinDesk that “There is a VAT exemption for currency transactions but the currency in question must be legal tender. We will of course listen to arguments for alternative VAT treatments under existing VAT law.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/14/bitcoin-in-the-uk-hmrc-suggests-bitcoins-are-taxable-vouchers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38cd227c81709d691693c487b1bd3989759d225d-1000x646.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376681,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beNB,1384431607,Canadian mining company pays wages in bitcoin and plans new cryptocurrency exchange,"Mining company Alix Resources has decided to start paying contractors with bitcoin for services in Canada.  The company plans to pay a contractor called Ridge Resources Ltd in bitcoins for exploratory services.  ""The growth of popularity in the bitcoin space as an alternate method of payment has led Alix to step into this very exciting market. This transaction is the first of its kind within the Canadian junior mining sector and positions Alix as a participant at an early stage in the global bitcoin marketplace,"" said Alix Resources CEO Michael England.  Canada's government has taken a wait-and-see approach in regards to regulation of distributed virtual currencies, which is enabling them to flourish in the country.  Interest in bitcoin is currently at an all time high, as the currency's price has hit record levels - it is now, at the time of writing, $405 per bitcoin.  Ironically enough, the process to create bitcoins is called ""mining"". This is a where a distributed network of computers connected to the internet solve mathematical problems known as proof of work to confirm bitcoin network transactions.  Alix Resources, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, is also planning to get into the bitcoin exchange business. The company has entered into an agreement with a private software vendor to license a bitcoin exchange, which will be administered by Alix. The firm's management anticipates the exchange will launch in early January.  Bitcoin exchanges are marketplaces where investors can buy bitcoins. Bitcoin exchanges have been under heavy scrutiny as of late following a number of problems.  A Czech Republic-based exchange was recently hacked, a Hong Kong-based exchange completely disappeared along with $4.1m and a Dutch exchange was used by identity thieves to launder money.  Canada, and Vancouver in particular, has seen a high level of interest in virtual currencies such as bitcoin.

42376682,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beKf,1384426588,Coinsetter launches private beta to 'make bitcoin trading quicker and more flexible',"New York-based exchange Coinsetter opened up its private beta this week, serving an international audience.  CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz started sending out around 100 private invitations each day to individuals as of Tuesday.  He is positioning the site as a ‘liquidity platform’, highlighting what he says is a superior matching engine for its order book. The software will enable people to trade more quickly and flexibly on the site, he claimed.  The firm touts millisecond trading as one of its differentiating features.  One turnaround for the firm was its announcement that it would now serve US-based traders. In August, Lukasiewicz had decided to cancel US trading plans, worrying that regulators would not look kindly on the firm’s lack of a money services business (MSB) license.  It has once again altered its business model for US traders, deciding to serve that market without initially accepting fiat currency from them.  “We will be a trading option for US customers,” said Lukasiewicz, adding:  “We removed money transmission from our actual platform, so when we deal with US customers, we’re not accepting dollar deposits.”  Customers make bitcoin deposits and withdrawals and effectively trade bitcoin/USD as a derivative, but the firm won’t be dealing with US dollars for US customers. He is working on introducing Automated Clearing House (ACH) functionality, however.  USD/BTC is Coinsetter’s only currency at present, driven largely by the need to chase liquid markets. Lukasiewicz says that he will consider “other interesting currency pairs” in the future.  Coinsetter has now registered as a money transmitting business with FinCEN, but is not registered as a money services business at a state level.  The CEO is hoping that the focus on derivatives trading will exclude him from MSB issues, but there are potential implications for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.  Unlike rival CoinX, which is also in public beta, Coinsetter has secured the ability for clients to make withdrawals and deposits on the European SEPA direct deposit network. These deposits will also be free during November.  The move to support US customers is a significant one for Lukasiewicz, who anticipates that half of his business will be domestic, with the rest coming from international clients. Outside the US, Canada will be his biggest market, which is one reason why Coinsetter’s international subsidiary is registered in Toronto.  Lukasiewicz said:  “Canada is going to be a huge market for us. The government has been pro-bitcoin. It’s very easy for me to get to. There are a lot of reasons why Canada is a good place to operate out of.”  In spite of Lukasiewicz’s concentration on liquidity, it will be relying on its own order book for the first few weeks.  A software bug caused the firm to pull its integration with exchange Bitstamp for the time being. It hopes to reintroduce that integration in the next month, which would enable it to trade on that exchange’s order book too.  In the meantime, it has a deal with a “major market maker” to secure liquidity for the platform.  “It means that for the first four weeks, we’ll be focusing on and testing the exchange,” said Lukasiewicz. “Even though it’s been difficult crossing that finish line integrating with Bitstamp, once we do get there we’ll be a stronger currency for it.”  One component of Coinsetter’s liquidity focus is its use of maker/taker pricing for its customers. Standard fees for bitcoin trades top out at 0.5% for trades up to 499 BTC over a 30-day period, dropping to 0.3% for trades over 1,000 BTC.  However, the company will reward market makers – those firms who offer extra liquidity by always being ready to buy and sell bitcoin – with rebates.  “This was just something that we heard from so many market makers on our site,” he said, explaining that the maker/taker rebates are restricted to those who introduce liquidity. He added:  “High volume traders on our site can reach levels where they will actually get paid to make trades.”  Margin trading – originally intended as a feature at launch – has been postponed and scaled down, said Lukasiewicz, who has said in the past that he wanted to be considered as the “forex.com of bitcoin trading”.  He will monitor customer feedback when exploring the rollout of margin trading features, he added.  Coinsetter received $500,000 in funding this April from a round led by Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, and was backed by luminaries including bitcoin investor Roger Ver.  Lukasiewicz has an interesting track record. Before Coinsetter, he co-founded online ticketing firm Ticketometer, and has a history in private equity and investment banking.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/14/coinsetter-launches-private-beta-to-make-bitcoin-trading-quicker-and-more-flexible,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c9039b5923f9643e508678dab1916e49a90f110-1142x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
