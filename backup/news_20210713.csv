The ETF will use a portion of the management fee to buy carbon credits and offset the carbon produced by the bitcoin held in the fund, Roberta Antunes, chief of growth at Hashdex, told CoinDesk.      The product will be listed on Brazilian stock exchange B3 as of Aug. 4, Antunes said. Investors have until July 30 to secure the first shares of the Hashdex Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price Index Fund (BITH11).      ""We understand that bitcoin can contribute greatly to encouraging the use of clean energy around the world. We want to anticipate this movement and offer investors a product that stimulates the sustainable potential of this asset,"" said Antunes. She added that the company has the support of the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI).      According to Hashdex, CCRI will produce annual reports containing calculations and estimates of energy consumption and carbon emissions relating to the mining process of all bitcoins acquired by BITH11.      Based on the calculations, the ETF will reduce its carbon footprint and seek to invest in stocks that make it feasible to maintain the environment, said Antunes. She said Hashdex will rely on CCRI's assistance in selecting potential partners and projects that aim to reduce the environmental impact in Brazil and worldwide.

42387248,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmChx,1626217260,Damien Hirst's NFT Experiment Explores Burning Question,"An “art-based social experiment” involving non-fungible tokens (NFTs) created by the celebrated British artist Damien Hirst was officially kicked off on Wednesday.      Hirst, who is probably most famous for exhibiting a 14-foot shark in a vitrine of formaldehyde, has launched “The Currency,” comprising a series of 10,000 of his widely recognized “spot paintings” on signed and watermarked sheets of A4 paper, along with digital watermarks in the form of NFTs cast on a blockchain.      The one-week window for applying to own one of the pieces opens Wednesday at 3 p.m. London time.      Over the past eight months or so, there has been a breathless rush into NFTs, which has seen sports stars, musicians and artists hawking blockchain-based title deeds linked to various items, climaxing in Christie’s auction house selling a digital artwork for $69 million in March.      However, Hirst’s foray into NFTs, a more measured affair, was over three years in the planning, according to Joe Hage, a collaborator of the artist’s. Hage is the CEO of art services business HENI, which has partnered with Brooklyn, N.Y.-based ConsenSys on the NFT-focused Palm ecosystem to bring Hirst’s work into crypto.      “It’s been a long time coming,” Hage said in an interview. “It’s such a beautiful project in its simplicity, but it’s been a challenge to do it the way we wanted, technologically.”      It also comes with the artist’s inimitable twist.      Buyers of “The Currency” (each edition is priced at $2,000) must choose whether to swap the sui generis digital version for the physical artwork. They will have one year from when the NFTs are distributed – or until 3 p.m. BST on July 27, 2022 – to decide to keep either the digital NFT or the A4 piece of paper.      If they have not exchanged their NFT in that period, the physical artwork will be destroyed. Similarly, if they have redeemed their token for the physical work, the NFT will be destroyed.      “It’s a kind of battle between the people who want the physical art world and people who want some NFT or digital art,” said Hage. “People can decide what they want, like an art-based social experiment.”      Only time will tell which version the market values more.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/13/damien-hirsts-nft-experiment-explores-burning-question,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8b321080e4fb7a2b7f02c634f1259a79d3e0408-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411924,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5U5,1626209274,DeFi Lending: 3 Major Risks to Know,"As with most things in the financial world, when something promises extremely high rates of return there’s usually a catch. DeFi lending is no exception.  To put it simply, DeFi, shorthand for decentralized finance, is an ecosystem of blockchain-based applications that offer a range of financial services similar to those provided by traditional banks, insurance brokers, and other financial intermediaries. The main difference being, these decentralized applications, known as dapps, run autonomously without any third party acting in the middle. That’s because each dapp is powered by a smart contract – a special computer program that automatically performs a function when certain predefined conditions are met.  DeFi lending is just one type of traditional financial service that is now accessible through these peer-to-peer operated dapps. Similar to depositing funds into a savings account to receive interest payments, crypto investors can now lock up their funds or use them to provide liquidity across a range of decentralized platforms and receive regular interest payments.  Many of the interest rates offered on these dapps are significantly greater than anything currently available in the traditional financial space, making DeFi lending a highly attractive passive income stream for crypto holders. But before lending any assets, there are a number of associated risks everyone should be made aware of.  Read more:5 Ways to Earn Passive Income From NFTs  Impermanent loss  When you commit your assets to a liquidity pool, you risk something known as “impermanent loss.”  Impermanent loss is when the price of assets locked up in a liquidity pool changes after being deposited and creates an unrealized loss (in dollar terms) versus if the liquidity provider had simply held the assets in a crypto wallet.  The change occurs for two reasons and has to do with the Automated Market Maker system DeFi liquidity pools use.  DeFi pools maintain a ratio of assets in the pool. For example, an ETH/LINK pool might fix the ratio of ether and link tokens in the pool at 1:50 (respectively). Meaning anyone wishing to provide liquidity would have to deposit both ether and link into the pool at that ratio.  DeFi pools rely on arbitrage traders to align pool asset prices with the current market value, i.e., if the market price of link is $15 but the value of link in an ETH/LINK pool is $14.50, arbitrage traders will spot the discrepancy and be financially incentivized to add ETH to the pool and remove the discounted LINK.  When arbitrage traders flood the pool with one token in order to remove the discounted token – in this example, adding ether to take out link – the ratio of coins changes. In order to regain balance, the liquidity pool automatically increases the price of the token in higher supply (link) and reduces the price of the token in lower supply (ether) to encourage arbitrage traders to rebalance the pool.  Once the pool rebalances, the rise in the value of the liquidity pool is often less than the value of the assets if held by the lending protocol. That's an impermanent loss.  Here’s a summary of the graph’s data and the relationship between price change and percentage loss:  1.25x price change = 0.6% loss  1.50x price change = 2.0% loss  1.75x price change = 3.8% loss  2x price change = 5.7% loss  3x price change = 13.4% loss  4x price change = 20.0% loss  5x price change = 25.5% loss  In defense of these protocols, liquidity providers (LPs) are rewarded with a proportionate amount of trading fees for adding assets to the pool, which can often offset impermanent losses. Uniswap, for example, charges a flat trading fee of 0.3% which is distributed to LPs.  Top tip: The best way to mitigate impermanent losses is to provide liquidity to pools containing less volatile assets such as stablecoins.  Impermanent loss shouldn’t be something that scares you away from DeFi lending, but rather a calculated risk to understand before lending your assets.  Flash loan attacks  Flash loans are a type of uncollateralized lending unique to the DeFi space. In the traditional, centralized model of banking, there are two types of loans:  Unsecured loans: These require no collateral because they are typically smaller amounts of money, think a few thousand dollars.  Secured loans: These are larger and require collateral like a property, car, investment, etc. Throughout the entire loan process, banks have tools to assess the credibility of clients, like credit scores, reports, and so on.  Flash loans are a type of unsecured loan that uses smart contracts to mitigate all the risks associated with traditional banking. The concept is simple: A borrower can receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto assets without putting up any collateral but the catch is they have to pay the full amount back within the same transaction it was sent (usually a few seconds).  If the loan isn’t paid back, the lender can simply roll back the transaction, like it never happened. Because there’s zero risk involved in issuing these types of loans, there is no limit to the amount a person can borrow. And because the entire process is decentralized, there are no credit scores or reports preventing a person from qualifying for a flash loan.  Flash loan attacks are when bad actors borrow huge sums of money using these special types of loans and use them to manipulate the market or exploit vulnerable DeFi protocols for their own personal gain.  A flash loan attack against the yield-farming aggregator PancakeBunny made headlines when the attackers caused the price of PancakeBunny’s token, BUNNY, to drop 95%. They did this by borrowing large amounts of BNB through the PancakeSwap lending protocol, manipulating the price of BUNNY in off-market lending pools, and then dumping that BUNNY on the open market, causing its price to crash.  As is the case with almost all flash loan attacks, the thieves escaped without repercussion. It’s estimated the attackers netted $3 million in total.  Once a liquidity pool is drained of a particular token, liquidity providers can become exposed to impermanent loss. Not to mention, lesser-known tokens hit by these attacks – such as BUNNY – cause investors to lose all confidence in the projects and they rarely recover in price.  DeFi rug pulls  Without traditional forms of regulation in the DeFi lending space, users have to develop a certain degree of trust with the platforms they’re willing to lend their assets to or buy tokens from. Unfortunately, that trust is often breached in the form of rug pulls.  Rug pulls are a type of exit scam where DeFi developers create a new token, pair it to a leading cryptocurrency such as tether or ether and set up a liquidity pool.  They then market the newly created token and encourage people to deposit into the pool, often promising extremely high yields. Once the pool has a substantial amount of the leading cryptocurrency in it, the DeFi developers then use back doors intentionally coded into the token’s smart contract to mint millions of new coins that they use to sell for the popular cryptocurrency. This completely drains the popular cryptocurrency from the pool and leaves millions of worthless coins in it. The founders then disappear without a trace.  A famed ""billion-dollar rug pull"" came in 2020, when SushiSwap developer Chef Nomi unexpectedly liquidated his SUSHI tokens after raising over a billion dollars in collateral. The price of the Uniswap competitor’s token fell to near zero in what is remembered as one of “the most dramatic moments in DeFi.”  DeFi fraud is a billion-dollar industry and, despite efforts to mitigate risks by developers, remains a prevalent aspect of the growing space. It was reported that the first half of 2021 brought triple the volume of DeFi hacks and fraud compared to 2020 altogether.  How to avoid these DeFi lending threats  Despite the rampant increase in this type of malicious activity, there are methods to vet a company for potential exit scams before investing. These include:  Verifying the team’s credibility on other projects.  Diligently reading through a project’s white paper.  Checking to see if the project’s code has been audited by a third party.  Being acute to potential red flags – like unrealistic projected returns and overspending on promotions and marketing.  Ultimately, the same permissionless designs that make DeFi protocols vulnerable to theft are its source of potential to disrupt the finance industry. Limited regulatory oversight paired with the open-source nature of blockchain means there will always be vulnerabilities for lending protocols dealing with large sums of money. As is true with almost all sectors of the blockchain industry, the goal is that these risks will be mitigated over time.  Further reading on DeFi  What Is DeFi?

The largest cryptocurrency is seen by many digital-asset investors as a hedge against inflation, and so the price reaction led to some head-scratching among Wall Street analysts. That’s been the case for the past couple months as the U.S. Bureau of Labor’s consumer price index (CPI) accelerated, with the price of bitcoin tumbling to about $32,800 now from an all-time high near $65,000 in April.      “Interesting that as CPI inflation has climbed from +1.4% y/y in January to 5.4% in June,bitcoin has essentially been cut in half,” Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, tweeted.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $32259, -1.68%  Ether (ETH) $1919.8, -4.59%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4369.22, -0.35%  Gold: $1809.1, +0.13%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.41%, compared with 1.369% on Monday    Looking at the larger macroeconomic picture puts bitcoin's price action into perspective: Bitcoin prices quadrupled last year as the U.S. Federal Reserve pumped trillions of freshly printed dollars into financial markets, nearly doubling in one year the amount of money it had created over the prior 107 years.      But bitcoin’s market reaction to faster-than-expected inflation also might reflect the topsy-turvy nature of financial markets, where the data points matter far less than what the Federal Reserve might do in response to them.      In this case, many economists say that the pace of inflation still appears to be “transitory,” as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has put it.      ""Fed officials are still telling everyone that `inflation is transitory,' while they pour an unjustifiable $120 billion into the market each month,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Tuesday.      But there’s an increased chance that some of those higher prices might last longer and thus push the U.S. central bank to curtail its easy-money policies sooner than previously expected. That might help explain bitcoin's weakness – if a ""looser-for-longer"" monetary policy starts to look less likely.      “A hot inflation report unnerved some investors as expectations grow that the Fed will have to acknowledge that higher inflation will stick around,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the brokerage Oanda, wrote in a daily note. “This inflation shock might not be a strong enough catalyst to break bitcoin’s recent trading range.”    Bitcoin’s range gets tighter    Bitcoin is in its eighth week stuck in a range of between roughly $30,000 and $40,000, and the sideways trading is reflected in the anemic cryptocurrency trading volumes of late.      The fast-moving gains witnessed earlier this year are nowhere to be seen at the moment. According to Alternative.me’s “Crypto Fear & Greed Index,” cryptocurrency markets are currently gripped by “extreme fear,” as noted Tuesday in a report by the Norwegian firm Arcane Research.      Even so, plenty of buyers have proven ready to pounce whenever bitcoin dips into the $30,000 range.      “Bitcoin’s consolidation range is getting tighter,” Arcane Research noted. According to the firm, the market is showing healthy signs, with future prices trading at a premium to the spot market. “A more aligned futures market is overall a healthy sign,” the firm said.      The largest cryptocurrency’s price volatility has declined recently, and a look at the historical chart (below) shows just how lackadaisical the market got during last year’s summer months in the Northern Hemisphere.    Bitcoin dominance inches back up    Ironically given bitcoin’s reputation as an extremely risky financial asset, the largest cryptocurrency might be considered the safest play for now, with some analysts declaring digital assets to be in a bear market.      Over the past seven days, bitcoin is down 4.3%, while ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has lost 14%.      “In a downward trending crypto market, bitcoin is the safest bet,” Arcane Research wrote. “This has led bitcoin’s market dominance to increase.”      “Market dominance” represents bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of all cryptocurrency markets. The gauge started off 2021 at around 70% but fell to about 40% as bitcoin's price retreated and alternative cryptocurrencies, or “altcoins,” rallied. Lately, it’s rebounded to about 45%.    Ether staking rewards – for the committed    CoinDesk Research’s just-published second-quarter review includes a chart comparing the returns from staking ether in Ethereum 2.0 with the returns available from depositing ether into decentralized lending apps like Compound, dYdX and Fulcrum.      “The rates on Eth 2.0 are significantly more attractive,” with an annualized rate of 6.72% versus “at most 2%” from the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, the report concluded.      The drawback is that “staking on Eth 2.0 does not offer users liquidity on their ether and requires a minimum of 32 ETH, worth $72,832 at the close of the quarter,"" according to the report. “Over the long term, as transfers are enabled on Eth 2.0 and a greater number of users trust the protocol with their ether holdings, the return for running a validator is expected to decrease and increasingly take on the role of a risk-free interest rate on Ethereum.    CPI shows big (transitory?) jump in used-auto prices    The U.S. consumer price index jumped by 5.4% in the 12 months through June, exceeding the 4.9% increase expected by economists.      Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 4.5% year over year, also higher than economists’ expectations of a 4% increase. On a month-to-month basis, consumer prices rose 0.9%, higher than the expected 0.5%, and accelerating from May’s 0.6% pace. Excluding food and energy, the index also rose 0.9% from the previous month.      The CPI report, released Tuesday, shows an economy that’s working through supply constraints while trying to meet increasing demand as the country reopens, with business lockdowns ending and coronavirus vaccines reaching more people.      “Many of the same indexes continued to increase, including used cars and trucks, new vehicles, airline fares and apparel,” the Labor Department wrote.      The CPI report is particularly important for some cryptocurrency investors who view bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.    Bitcoin technical analysis    According to Eqonex: ""A break below $32,000 will allow the bears to push for a return to support at $29,800, with $28,700 being the key level the bulls must protect. On the upside, the bulls will need to close the market above $33,600 to prevent further downside price action. Above $33,600, we look for $34,600 to limit gains as the market continues to trade is a tight sideways pattern.""

42387233,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmCMZ,1626203539,"Between Binance and FATF, More Attention Turns to Crypto Compliance: BitGo's Horowitz","Cryptocurrency regulation reads more like a film script than the traditionally dull and stodgy world of financial rulemaking.      Just look at the hot water Binance appears to be in now, with regulatory authorities from the U.K., Japan and Germany, to name a few, calling foul against the exchange.      More broadly, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog, is reviewing the crypto industry annually. But the sector is moving so fast that FATF guidance teams are left scratching their heads, wondering how to deal with things like decentralized finance (DeFi).      For now, the regulatory focus is mainly directed at crypto’s third-party intermediaries, the exchanges, trading desks and custodians. When it comes to this arena of virtual asset service providers (VASPs), Jeff Horowitz, chief compliance officer at BitGo, a digital assets custodian,, understands where regulatory tensions and fault lines lie. Prior to joining BitGo in October, Horowitz spent two years steering compliance efforts at Coinbase, the now-publicly listed crypto exchange.    Read more: BitGo Taps Former Coinbase Exec Jeff Horowitz as Chief Compliance Officer    Asked his opinion on Binance, Horowitz said Binance.US – the arm of the Binance business serving American customers and complying with U.S. regulations – made a “smart move” when it hired former U.S. banking supervisor Brian Brooks. (Brooks previously served as U.S. acting comptroller of the currency, and prior to that worked alongside Horowitz as Coinbase’s chief legal officer.)      “If there’s anybody who can balance being regulated and growing a business, I think Brian will be able to pull it off,” Horowitz said in an interview. “From what I know, Binance.US and Binance.com are two very separate companies. I think embracing regulation is the only path to go for the long run.”      Binance is said to be looking to hire an ex-regulator or government figure like Brooks for the U.K., where a satellite company owned by Binance attempted to become regulated, but was later slapped down by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). A Binance spokesperson described the situation as a “misunderstanding” with the FCA.    Read more: Binance Said to Be Hiring ‘UK Version of Brian Brooks’    Coinbase, in the Form S-1 it filed when going public, made mention of Binance’s lack of regulatory compliance as potentially giving it an unfair competitive advantage.      “Coinbase and other entities long ago made a decision to play the long game and go the regulated route. And there is a cost to doing that,” Horowitz said, adding:    “I don’t think anyone wants to change direction there, but they do want this to be a level playing field. I think that is the only way that folks aren’t running to the path of least resistance or finding the one country where they’ll be able to do things that you can’t do in other spaces.”  Have rules, will travel    Preventing regulatory arbitrage, when the rules are still only half-baked, is the challenge being addressed by the FATF, which has made the recommendation that firms like BitGo and Coinbase share customer identification data along with cryptocurrency transactions over a certain amount, known colloquially as the “travel rule.”      Aside from devising a technical travel rule system everyone is happy with, there’s obvious concern among large established businesses when it comes to sharing sensitive customer information with lesser known third parties. That has led to a piecemeal approach, where firms in more buttoned-up jurisdictions like the U.S., Switzerland and Singapore are rolling out products for registered crypto firms in those regions.    Read more: Seychelles, Longtime Home of BitMEX, Is Bending to US Pressure on KYC    In terms of those sorts of products, Horowitz is proud to have been the initial driving force behind the U.S. Travel Rule Working Group (USTRWG), which he originated when he was at Coinbase.      “The reality is there are multiple solutions being built and at some point they’ll need to be interoperable. But we were feeling the regulatory pressure to start building,” he said.      The 30-plus member USTRWG includes a core membership composed of firms like Coinbase, BitGo, Gemini, Fidelity Digital Assets, Paxos and Kraken. No mean feat then to get these bare-knuckle crypto competitors round the table to collaborate.      “I come from traditional finance, where legal and compliance would collaborate and put competition aside for the right thing for the industry,” Horowitz said. “And we just partnered, and I’m pretty proud of that.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/13/between-binance-and-fatf-more-attention-turns-to-crypto-compliance-bitgos-horowitz,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42387244,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmCaP,1626197369,DeFi Gets Proactive About Policy Thanks to a $20M Grant From the Uniswap Community,"The freshly funded DeFi Education Fund (DEF), a new policy organization supported through Uniswap, turned half of the assets allocated to it by Uniswap governance, 500,000 UNI (around $10 million) into USDC via a trade facilitated by Genesis, it announced on Monday.      DEF was created to advocate for policies friendly to decentralized finance (DeFi) globally. Marc Boiron, one of the signatories to the group's multisig and a member of the group's steering committee, told CoinDesk that deploying half the funds quickly was part of the plan communicated to UNI holders from the start.      The fund was formed with 1 million UNI (worth a little over $19 million at press time) after receiving support from holders of Uniswap's UNI governance token. The vote closed on June 29, with 79.7 million UNI voting in favor and 15.0 million voting against. It's only the third proposal to successfully pass the Uniswap community's governance process. Many of the supporters of the proposal were very large wallets, though two of the top 10 largest wallets voting on the measure were in opposition.      ""I wouldn't say I feel that we're behind, but if I think that if we were to wait any longer we would be behind,"" Boiron, who also serves as general counsel at the options exchange dYdX, said in a phone call.      A timeline for issuing a budget is delineated in the proposal on the voting page on Uniswap's website.      The first order of business for DEF is hiring a policy director, its first staffer. The nascent organization shared the job listing on Twitter on July 2.      Decentralized finance (DeFi) has proven to be one of the biggest drivers of activity in the blockchain industry since mid-2020. There's now more than $100 billion committed to different financial projects across the biggest blockchains. However, these projects don't adhere to the kind of customer scrutiny that the traditional financial world has, and regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have started to pay attention.      When it was first raised as an idea on May 27 on the Uniswap forums by the Harvard Law Blockchain and Fintech Initiative, the post authors wrote, ""Governments around the world are considering how they will regulate decentralized finance, and we need to defend the ecosystem and decentralized ideals.""      Boiron said, ""Two things that DEF plans on focusing on [are]: One, funding organizations that have expertise or can easily gain expertise in DeFi and can advance policy or thought leadership or any of the other goals the fund is looking to advance. And, second, to educate others and organizations on policy and DeFi.""      Boiron is a member of an initial committee laid out in the Uniswap proposal. The other members are:    Larry Sukernik of Reverie  Rebecca Rettig of Aave  Jake Chervinsky of Compound Labs  Katie Biber of Brex  Sheila Warren of the World Economic Forum (and co-host of a CoinDesk podcast)  Marvin Ammori of Uniswap Labs    By and large, he said, the crypto policy organizations have not done a lot on DeFi yet but ""if we fund them with capital they can use on DeFi specific issues, that's not capital they have to go find elsewhere,"" he said.      Early on, getting more written content in places that can move policy, such as policy papers from think tanks or op-eds in the pages of large newspapers, will be a high priority for the new policy director. The director will also be part of devising a budget for the organization within 90 days of the proposal passing, as promised in the Uniswap proposal.    The funds    The UNI allocation a one-time contribution with no promise of future investment. At roughly $20 million, that's a very strong starting budget for a trade organization.      For comparison, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the internet industry spent a little over $80 million on disclosed legislative activities through 2020.      Facebook and Amazon, two companies with market capitalizations over a billion dollars, were the top spenders, at $19.7 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Alphabet (Google's parent company) came in a somewhat distant third at $8.7 million.      The job listing and the proposal on Uniswap both note that part of the job of the new policy director will be to interface with other decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) with an eye toward securing additional funds from other communities. The Harvard group wrote, ""We expect other communities will contribute as they wake up to additional threats and rushed proposals targeting them directly.""      The fund has been created as a 501(c)(4), a non-profit designation in the U.S. that allows for slightly more political activity than most non-profits are permitted; while the income of such organizations is not taxed, donations to them are generally not tax-deductible. A source familiar with the group told CoinDesk that it planned to move quite quickly and that the first position should be filled very, very soon.      While the first $10 million is likely to go out the door quickly as DEF gets off to a rapid start, the second half will be spent over about five years, to make the organization sustainable, according to Boiron.    First staffer    The job listing describes a collection of objectives that sound fairly typical of a new policy organization, such as engaging with the media, policymakers and devising an overall strategy. There's already an existing network of policy organizations focused on crypto in the United States, such as Coin Center, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and the Blockchain Association.      For once it seems like the regulators are ahead of industry. Case in point: the Financial Action Task Force, which coordinates anti-crime regulations in finance globally, has explicitly directed its attention to the DeFi industry's lack of know-your-customer measures.      While DEF didn't exist as that conversation was underway, ""several of the DeFi education fund members were very involved in exactly that,"" Boiron said. FATF is holding off finalizing these rules until at least October.      Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, wrote in an email, ""There is so much work to be done educating policymakers in Washington, especially when it comes to DeFi. We welcome additional voices in this space and look forward to coordinating with the DeFi Education Fund.""      The Harvard Law students argued in their initial proposal:    ""The need for such an organization is urgent as governments around the world are awakening to decentralized finance and are rushing to regulate the projects without being properly educated on their benefits. Currently DeFi is not at the table – but on the menu.""    UPDATE (July 13, 2021, 17:55 UTC): Corrects Grayscale to Genesis in the first paragraph.

42387240,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmCRb,1626195684,Chainlink Challenger Band Protocol Launches Next Phase of Its Network,"Band Protocol, the second-biggest blockchain data provider after market leader Chainlink, has gone live with its next version, dubbed “BandChain 2.”      So-called blockchain oracles, such as Band Protocol, Chainlink and others, pipe external information into digital smart contracts to power areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), the vast majority of which is attached to the Ethereum public ledger.      Back in 2017 Band Protocol chose to build using Cosmos blockchain software, a system focused on helping chains talk to each other and exchange assets seamlessly, looking beyond DeFi’s home on Ethereum.      As the current version of Ethereum has gradually become rather crowded and expensive to complete transactions on, faster and more nimble options have sprung up, supporting Band Protocol CEO Soravis Srinawakoon’s interoperability thesis.      “We wanted to be cross-chain compatible from the early days, in the belief that there will be a bunch of blockchains with different designs and trade-offs,” Srinawakoon said in an interview, adding:    “You can see this play out with big players like Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, BSC [Binance Smart Chain] and Terra. So we positioned ourselves to address the needs of these faster, cheaper and more scalable blockchains.”    A key part of Band Protocol’s move to phase two is to allow data providers to run nodes themselves rather than having intermediaries acquire the data. It’s a shift that will make the system more transparent and decentralized, an approach chosen by other data services such as API3, another data oracle provider.      Srinawakoon says this should eventually bring more traditional players onto the network, providing what he called “premium APIs” with which these firms can monetize that data directly. While Band Protocol is at least an order of magnitude smaller than Chainlink at the moment, the number two network has made great strides when it comes to soliciting data partners, being the first blockchain project to join the OpenAPI Initiative.    Read more: Band Protocol Becomes First Blockchain Project to Join OpenAPI Initiative    As a result, Band Protocol has formed working relationships with the likes of Google, Microsoft and financial data giant Bloomberg, although Srinawakoon pointed out these potential partnerships are still “a work in progress.”      In terms of getting traditional players to adopt his vision of a more transparent and decentralized option, Srinawakoon said the main obstacle is, how do you get these firms to actually use your solution?      “That's a big hurdle,” he said. “Because it’s actually quite difficult to convince a firm like Bloomberg to run your infrastructure. So we try to make sure it’s as seamless as possible and these players can use existing infrastructure and make it easier to onboard them.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | LINK | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/13/chainlink-challenger-band-protocol-launches-next-phase-of-its-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93380f1c729b7032b8e34805afb1e9f75323bc68-1280x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Is It Time to Buy Bitcoin?,"Inflation has hit its highest level in 13 years, according to new Consumer Price Index data released today. Year-over-year inflation hit a whopping 5.4%, well above the 2% long-term rate target the U.S. Federal Reserve sees as economically healthy.      Some bitcoin investors may take that as a buy signal: Bitcoiners have long argued the digital currency has the potential to act as a hedge against inflation in any single currency. That argument often hinges on bitcoin’s strictly limited supply, but just as important is its global nature, disconnected from any one country’s economy or currency. As bitcoin adoption grows, that case becomes stronger.      But professional investors remain seemingly unperturbed by the inflation spike, suggesting caution even if you fully buy into bitcoin’s anti-inflation thesis.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    Before this morning’s report, institutions and other big wheels were in lockstep with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s prediction that this wave of inflation is transitory. This morning’s CPI surprise doesn’t seem to have changed their minds: Bond yields remained essentially unchanged, with yield on the 10-year Treasury note actually slipping slightly to 1.35%.      The bond market is a gauge of investor sentiment on inflation because high long-term inflation cuts into the returns from bonds, which have maturities ranging from five to 30 years. So when investors expect long-term inflation, bonds sell off, which pushes down the underlying bond’s price. That, in turn, (and this is the neat part) increases the percentage return (yield) for new buyers. That gives counterparties who are short inflation the chance to bet on that expectation, and in the process set a new consensus inflation projection. Markets are very cool sometimes!    Read more: Money Reimagined: Inflation Is Here? Always Has Been | Adam B. Levine    But almost nobody is unloading and pushing those yields down further right now, despite 13-year inflation highs. Why?      The basic argument against worrying about the current inflation surge remains the same: It’s a transitory effect of the coronavirus pandemic. And if you think inflation is transitory, the five- or 10-year horizon on a Treasury bond means you’re fine just sitting on your hands – a three- or even four-month inflation spike isn’t really going to hurt you. (This is a very big-picture read, however. James Mackintosh at The Wall Street Journal takes a look at an array of other factors in bond expectations, arguing that low yields also partly reflect an expectation the Fed will hike interest rates before the end of the year.)      Most obviously, it’s key to remember these are year-over-year numbers, and last June we were still very much in the terrifying belly of the COVID-19 beast. Unemployment in the U.S. stood at 11.2%, compared to 5.9% right now. Even the stock market still hadn’t climbed back from the massive March COVID-19 crash. So, naturally, people were spending much less and pushing prices down; current year-over-year numbers simply look high against a low baseline.      Inflation is also highly concentrated in a subset of goods associated with global disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic and the surge of demand that has followed reopening in the United States. The prime example is used cars, which are currently up 45.2% since this time last year thanks to a Rube Goldberg-caliber chain of events involving semiconductor production in Asia. That alone makes up about one-third of the current inflation above previous norms.      Many of these specific categories are already coming back down to Earth. Wholesale auto prices actually dipped last month, and retail prices typically lag those by one to two months, so that’s a huge chunk of June inflation that is already working its way out of the system. The story is similar for lumber, which was the commodity inflation story of the Spring thanks to futures that as much as quadrupled. But prices were down 0.6% for the year as of Monday.      Of course, none of this definitively means inflation will disappear – we’re in the third month of the Fed’s inflation outlook being proven wrong. More profoundly, you may be skeptical of the CPI number itself thanks to changes in how it has been calculated, as CoinDesk’s Adam Levine outlined last week.      If you’re losing faith in the Fed (or didn’t have much to begin with), there’s increasingly strong empirical evidence that bitcoin should be on your shopping list: Recent data shows bBitcoin is tracking higher bond yields, and those should rise sharply if and when the broader market changes its mind about Jerome Powell’s predictions.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

42387226,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBm9L7,1626193499,Don't Blame Bitcoin for Ransomware,"Amid the growing geopolitical threat of ransomware, crypto has become a stalking horse. Following a slew of high-profile exploits, there have been calls to ban or surveil blockchain networks, with the thinking that bitcoin catalyzes cybercrime.      The risks of ransomware are real: Any organization that relies on computers may be vulnerable to digital extortion. The threat isn’t always clear: Malware can be developed or deployed by individuals, state-backed groups or hacking collectives. And the price is high: Computer hijackings can disrupt critical infrastructure from the electricity grids to watersheds, endangering lives and economies.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Considering the amorphous threat that ransomware presents, crypto seems like a vector for concrete action. After all, the Colonial Pipeline hackers were paid in BTC. So was REvil, a group that once attacked Apple, and which was paid $70 million in bitcoin for its recent Kaseya exploit. A new crowdfunding site, Ransomwhe.re, looks to track bitcoin payments to wallets associated with ransomware gangs.      But blaming crypto for the rise in ransomware is a mistake, said Marcus Hutchins, a British computer security researcher with a storied career in the malware industry. In a video titled “Why Destroying Bitcoin Wouldn't Stop Ransomware,” Hutchins notes that hackers will find a way, with or without bitcoin.      “Cryptocurrency has certainly made ransomware more accessible and contributed to its proliferation, but without it these kinds of attacks would have persisted,” he told CoinDesk. When the malware industry first emerged in 2012, it was the norm to accept U.S. dollars for exploits.      While the recent trend of corporate hacks has primarily been funded through crypto – Chainalysis found crypto payments to ransomware spiked to $412 million last year – that’s not reason enough to take action against a nascent industry.      “We have absolutely no data on what corporate ransomware attacks might look like without cryptocurrency. We can only theorize based on past techniques, but not future innovations. Therefore, advocating banning cryptocurrency to stop ransomware is naive at best,” he tweeted.    Read more: The Ransom-Ware | Marc Hochstein    Hutchins is renowned in the hacker community for stopping WannaCry in 2017, at the time the largest ransomware attack, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide and shut down over a dozen U.K. hospitals.      He’s also the architect of darknet sites, botnets and malware scripts. As a teenager, Hutchins began spending time on web forums, where he fell into ghostwriting malicious code. It paid well, in recreational drugs and bitcoin. One script would eventually land him in U.S. custody, in a story told in full by Wired.      Since reformed, Hutchins has worked to reverse engineer malware and provide security advice. He also started a popular blog called Malware Tech. Having watched the ransomware industry evolve over the past decade, Hutchins says emphatically that the recent rise in ransomware cannot be pinned on crypto.      CoinDesk caught up with him to hear more.      Is there a natural rate of ransomware attacks we might expect even if bitcoin/crypto were banned/never existed?      Cryptocurrency has certainly made ransomware more accessible and contributed to its proliferation, but without it these kinds of attacks would have persisted. The sophisticated cyber-crime groups have access to money laundering networks, so are capable of working with USD. It's impossible to estimate how much ransomware there'd be without cryptocurrency, because today's corporate targeted ransomware only came about around 2016, when cryptocurrency was already the norm for payments.      Some have said bitcoin is a horrible currency to use for criminal operations as every transaction is recorded. What happened after the Colonial Pipeline hack is case in point. What do you think?      Typically bitcoin is preferred, as it can facilitate fast, frictionless, automated payment validation infrastructure. But, due to its traceable nature, many gangs opt to cash out the bitcoin and launder in USD instead.      You’ve noted that ransomware uses the banking system, money transmitters like Western Union, alternatives like Liberty Reserve and crypto. Considering the scope and history of cybercrime, is the only potential solution to ransomware more surveillance of all financial systems?      No. This is not a solution at all, only a partial mitigation. While gangs are capable of operating with impunity from non-extradition countries, it doesn't matter how easily they can be tracked down if they cannot be arrested or stopped.      The way hackers are written about sometimes paints ransomware as a professionalizing industry. Does this square with your experience?      Yes, some of these groups have complex organization structures with departments, management and task pipelines.      What would you generally recommend to a company or government that has been infected?      It's important to undergo an external IR to investigate the full scale and scope of the attack.      NTT, a Japanese tech services provider, found that cryptojackers made up 41% of all detected malware in 2020. What do you make of this trend? Is this cause for legitimate concern? Is it just a matter of rising crypto prices?      Cryptojacking is one of the ways to monetize device access with the lowest barrier to entry; as a result, it's accessible to even the lowest skilled hackers, thus very widespread. Due to the non-destructive nature of cryptojacking I believe it's something to be addressed, but not a high priority threat like ransomware.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/13/dont-blame-bitcoin-for-ransomware,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81d417d674633e4350318defc16ecc5e1d2b5893-2400x1804.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round was led by CoinFund and ParaFi Capital, but also included investments from Coinbase Ventures, the Solana Foundation, Defiance Capital and other heavyweights in the crypto ecosystem including individual investors Sandeep Naiwal of Polygon and Meltem Demirors of CoinShares.      ClayStack’s platform, which will launch alpha testing by September, enables users to stake their digital assets without the lockup periods associated with traditional crypto staking. When users deposit their crypto in the platform’s smart contracts, they receive an equivalent liquid derivative token that remains fungible and transferable, and earns them daily rewards.      Traditional staking yields high rewards, but requires a lockup period that results in illiquidity. Innovations in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem have been attempting to solve this problem with liquid staking. One major liquidity staking platform, Liquidstake, offers liquidity in the form of USDC as a loan for staked ETH, but ClayStack’s multi-coin approach is a departure from the norm.    Read more: Ethereum Heavyweights Launch LiquidStake Loans to Ease Eth 2.0 ‘Lockup’    “We believe ClayStack has developed an efficient solution that addresses the shortcomings of present-day liquid staking protocols,” CoinFund CEO Jake Brukhman said in a statement.      ClayStack currently supports three blockchains – the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon and The Graph. ClayStack CEO Mohak Agarwal told CoinDesk users can expect a Solana rollout shortly after launch, and a rollout to other chains in the future.      Agarwal believes that ClayStack’s platform also caters to its users in a unique way, and can work for both small yield farmers with a few thousand dollars worth of digital assets as well as “whales moving millions or billions.”      The funds generated from the seed round will be used to hire additional staff and further build out the ClayStack platform.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC | SOL,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/13/coinfund-parafi-lead-52m-seed-round-for-liquidity-staking-platform-claystack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f591200e203028d2c60c69358409484798cd8c91-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Bank of Korea (BOK) confirmed on July 12 that Line Plus, Ground X and SK C&C have entered bids to contribute R&D work on the project.      BOK announced in May that it would hold a bidding process to select a “technology supplier” for its CBDC test. The central bank has not confirmed however, that it will go ahead with issuing a CBDC after the pilot is finished. In fact, BOK has made it clear that it plans to only conduct “preliminary research” on CBDC adoption and viability.      BOK is expected to announce its selection sometime in August based on its evaluation of each firm's technological capacity. The company that wins the bid will work on the country's CBDC experiment from August 2021 to June 2022.    Read more: South Korea’s Central Bank to Choose Supplier for Digital Currency Pilot    The pilot will be divided into two phases. The first will run from August to December of this year. This initial phase will focus on laying the technical groundwork and determining the specific technology required for issuing a CBDC.      The second will take place between January and June of 2022. This phase will focus on making real-life transactions and settlements, using CBDCs to purchase other digital assets and implementing privacy protections.    The CBDC pilot contenders    Line Plus is an affiliate of the portal site operator Naver; Ground X is the blockchain subsidiary of mobile platform Kakao; and SK C&C is the IT and system integration (SI) arm of the SK Group conglomerate.      Line Plus and Ground X publicly expressed interest in BOK's potential CBDC project from the onset. Both firms offered their services as consultants when BOK began CBDC discussions last year.      Line Plus launched a website devoted to explaining its CBDC and blockchain technology on July 11. Line indicated that it plans on developing a three-layer blockchain for its CBDC platform: a network layer, a consensus layer and an application layer.      It also claimed it will support inter-chain protocols that will allow Line's blockchain to interact with chains of CBDCs from other countries.      Ground X operates its own blockchain platform, Klaytn, which has a governance council that includes the likes of LG Electronics and Binance.      Ground X also developed the technology for CBDC projects in Singapore, Australia and Thailand.      SK C&C launched its private enterprise blockchain ChainZ for Ethereum in June 2020. It allows approved entities to issue and trade their own tokens on the chain. SK C&C also provides its own key recovery service.      No consortia were permitted to partake in the bidding process.

Olaf Carlson-Wee’s Polychain Capital led the $4 million equity round and participated in the $17 million liquidity round. Other investors included 0x Labs, DeFi Alliance and MetaCartel DAO.      Clipper, which launched on June 30, uses a novel automated market maker (AMM) that promises to offer guaranteed best prices for retail-sized trades, which are typically under $10,000.      As more centralized crypto exchanges compete for market share, trading fees are facing downward pressure. Top exchanges like Coinbase, which is notorious for its high trading fees and derives most of its revenue from those fees, are competing with no-fee and low-fee crypto trading platforms, like Robinhood.      According to Mark Lurie, the CEO of Shipyard Software (the company behind Clipper), most of the other low-fee and no-fee crypto exchanges have hidden costs baked into trades or other “catches” like the time limit on free trading at Crypto.com or KuCoin, and the need for a native token from decentralized exchange Digix.      Clipper’s relatively small $20 million liquidity pool means that it can’t effectively serve whales (those with large crypto holdings) or institutional traders, but that is what allows the DEX to keep fees low.      “We believe that Shipyard is beginning with a genuinely innovative approach by targeting small to medium-sized traders, not whales,” Carlson-Wee said in a statement. “Shipyard’s tech will fill a desperately needed void of DEXs that cater to retail traders.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/13/polychain-leads-21m-round-for-retail-oriented-dex,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15ff1216c3c0a17eef700988f6c0a3661e735b50-1500x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a July 9 report in The Economic Times, the bank has modified the ""Retail Outward Remittance Application"" form to include a declaration that ""remittance is NOT for investment/purchase of bitcoin/cryptocurrencies/virtual currencies (such as ethereum, ripple [XRP], litecoin, dash, peercoin, dogecoin, primecoin, chinacoin, ven, bitcoin or any other virtual currency/cryptocurrency/bitcoin).""      Users intending to transfer money overseas under the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) liberalized remittance scheme now need to sign that declaration, which also dissuades customers from investing in ""units of mutual funds/shares or any other capital instrument of a company dealing in bitcoins/cryptocurrency/virtual currencies.""      The modified form also seeks a declaration that the source of the funds to be remitted is not the redemption of crypto investments. The change comes several weeks after major Indian lenders suspended banking services to local crypto exchanges and effectively shuts out overseas markets for traders.    See also: India’s HDFC Bank Calls Bitcoin a Fad as Exchanges Mull Legal Fight Over Restrictions    The RBI said on May 31 that lenders cannot cite its now-invalid crypto banking ban, imposed in April 2018, to block services to crypto exchanges and traders.

42387227,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBm9MN,1626183000,State of Crypto: Binance Is Firmly in the Regulatory Crosshairs,"More than half a dozen national regulators have published warnings, announced investigations or otherwise cautioned investors about crypto exchange Binance and its different affiliates. Is this part of a coordinated global action – or just a coincidence?    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Breaking Binance  The narrative    Several countries have announced investigations into or published warnings against Binance, currently the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. It’s unclear if this is a coordinated effort by regulators or something closer to a domino effect. What we do know for sure is that Binance is under a powerful microscope – and I seriously doubt we’re done hearing about enforcement actions against the platform.    Why it matters    More than any other centralized cryptocurrency platform, what happens to Binance may signal how regulators will approach crypto, with enforcement actions against the exchange hinting at what other platforms should expect.      It’s important to note here that any interpretations are likely to be specific to centralized exchanges and how they’re operating. The regulatory crackdown on Binance will almost certainly not apply to crypto trading or decentralized/peer-to-peer platforms.    Breaking it down    Over the last few weeks, regulators in a handful of different nations have announced that they are either investigating Binance or that Binance (or one of its legal entities) isn’t authorized to operate within its borders. Still more countries have warned users about the exchange. Several banks or payment processors, primarily in Europe and the U.K., have subsequently cut off the exchange, potentially stranding its customers.      In just the past few weeks:    The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority warned that Binance Markets Limited (an affiliate of Binance Global) is not authorized to operate within the country.  A number of British banks, including Barclays, Nationwide, Santander and Clear Junction, then pulled Binance’s access or announced reviews of their approach to crypto at large. Still, Binance said sterling withdrawals and debit/credit card purchases were enabled after briefly losing access to Faster Payments at the end of last month.  This morning, Faster Payments once again suspended the exchange.  The European Union’s Single Euro Payments Area appears to have (temporarily) cut off Binance.  Japan’s Financial Services Agency warned that Binance is not registered to do business within the country. This seems specific to the transfer and exchange services, and not the operation of the exchange’s technical platform (which appears to run on AWS servers in Japan).  The Cayman Islands announced that Binance Group and Binance Holdings Ltd. are not authorized to operate within the country.  Binance withdrew from the Canadian province of Ontario after the Ontario Securities Commission announced a handful of other exchanges had failed to comply with local regulations.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it’s watching Binance Holdings Ltd. and Binance Asia Services Pte. (another separate legal entity).  Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission announced it filed a criminal complaint against Binance for operating without a license within the country.  Banks in South Africa shut off credit card transactions for international crypto exchanges, including Binance (though this seems to be part of a broader crackdown).  WazirX, an Indian crypto exchange owned by Binance, was issued a show cause notice by India’s Enforcement Directorate on allegations that Chinese nationals laundered around $7.6 million through WazirX into Binance.  Silvergate Bank cut off withdrawals and deposits for Binance, but notably not Binance.US.    That’s a lot of investigations! And it’s not even getting into the investigations that are ongoing, the largest of which may perhaps be through the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Department of Justice.      The best parallel to these agencies’ investigation of Binance is likely the ongoing legal action against Bitmex and founder Arthur Hayes. The feds went after Bitmex on allegations it offered derivatives trading to U.S. customers and did not conduct appropriate know-your-customer checks. Federal officials are also reportedly investigating Binance on similar charges, as well as money laundering and tax evasion concerns.      Binance, however, is much, much bigger than Bitmex.      (It’s important to mention here that no wrongdoing has yet been alleged by U.S. officials, and we don’t even know whether they’ll bring an enforcement action.)      It’s possible that the regulatory backlash to Binance also reflects founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao’s stated goal of creating a decentralized business with no headquarters.      The exchange is reacting to this by hiring a number of former regulators to its compliance and executive teams.      Binance.US has brought on former Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks and former California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation Commissioner Manuel Alvarez.      The global version of the exchange is now looking to hire an equivalent policymaker in the U.K., after bringing on former Financial Action Task Force officials Rick McDonell and Josée Nadeau, as well as former U.S. Senator Max Baucus.      CZ called more regulations “a positive sign” in an open letter last week which said the exchange is “committed to being compliant … wherever we operate.”    Circle is going public    Circle Internet Financial announced it was going public through a special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC) transaction last week, to be completed later this year. In addition to being the latest high-profile crypto company to go public, Circle is the other half of the Centre Consortium that is ostensibly in charge of the USDC stablecoin (alongside Coinbase, which went public earlier this year).      In an investor presentation, Circle estimated that USDC in circulation could more than double from about $26 billion as of Monday to over $80 billion by next year, and jump to a staggering $194 billion by the end of 2023.      Of course, Circle’s announcement has renewed scrutiny around just what is backing the USDC stablecoin, and how secure these reserves are.      Jeremy Allaire, the exchange’s CEO, promised that Circle will provide more detail after the company completes its transaction to go public.      “They deserve a greater degree of transparency,” Allaire told CoinDesk TV last week. “Our intention is to include greater reserves transparency there.”      These are similar questions to those that critics ask about the reserves backing Tether’s USDT.      Stablecoins more broadly have been increasingly scrutinized by global financial regulators over the past few years, but conversation around fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies seems to have shifted from focusing on global stablecoins (i.e., the former vision for libra) to centrally issued ones (i.e., USDC, USDT).      I’m curious to see whether this results in firmer action or regulations, particularly as stablecoins take on a more important role within the crypto world.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    This isn’t in the list above but the U.S. Senate confirmed Jen Easterly to run the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a Department of Homeland Security entity focused on, uh, cybersecurity. I strongly suspect Easterly’s initial work will focus heavily on ransomware – both mitigating such attacks and finding ways to investigate them. The Biden Administration has already mentioned crypto analysis a few times in statements about ransomware. Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger was the latest official to reiterate this position in a statement last week.    Elsewhere:  Why China’s Ban on Crypto Mining Is More Serious Than Before: China’s most recent mining ban may be driven as much by the nation’s energy policies as its crypto policies, my colleague David Pan reports. China's environmental policy mandates that it cut back on coal power, meaning energy-intensive operations (such as crypto mining). This suggests this crackdown may last longer than the last one.  Can Taiwan Become Asia’s Crypto Haven? Not Yet: China’s crackdown on crypto could have led to a boost in Taiwan’s crypto economy, but it hasn’t, according to my colleague Sandali Handagama. This is partly due to strict anti-money laundering requirements and partly due to some vague regulations in other areas.  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Wall Street Journal) Investors in South Africa are looking for Ameer and Raees Cajee, the founders of Africrypt, a crypto investment firm. The Cajees have apparently disappeared after claiming that the platform was hacked.

42387219,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBm9B3,1626181362,"Interoperability Project Connext Raises $12M From 1kx, ConsenSys","A startup with a novel method for moving value between layer 2s and other blockchains has raised $12 million in a round led by 1kx and ConsenSys Mesh.      Connext uses an approach to moving funds among different blockchains, sidechains and layer 2s that looks a lot like how automated market makers (AMMs) operate.      ""Our thesis as a company has really been that user experience is what's needed in the space,"" Arjun Bhuptani, the project lead, said in a phone interview.      With Ethereum periodically getting bogged down (and expensive to use) when something like non-fungible tokens or a new decentralized finance project cause a stir, there's been more and more of a push to move activity to chains connected to but not dependent on Ethereum. That creates a new problem of value stranded on the wrong network when a hot opportunity comes up.      Connext operates by enabling liquidity providers to put funds into pools on two different chains, which makes it easy for users to swiftly move between chains.      So, for example, one user can put 1,000 DAI on both Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Then another user can come along and deposit 100 DAI on BSC with instructions to send 100 DAI to an address on Polygon.      An oracle will then verify the deposit on BSC and communicate that to the Polygon pool. Then the withdrawal can happen.      Liquidity providers (LPs) will earn 5 basis points right now for every transaction. That number could go up a bit but Bhuptani expects the product should be profitable for LPs at levels so low that users are likely to never really notice.      The new investment funds will be used to build out the team and to run the route auctions program, a method to help make sure funds stay balanced across chains.      Other investors include: eGirl Capital, Ethereal Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, MetaCartel Ventures, Scalar Capital and others. The team says that more than 80 entities participated in the round.    Bridges    The traditional approach up to this point has been the bridging approach, where one entity controls a pool that serves as an on- and off-ramp. This requires a high degree of trust in one entity and can also often makes for very slow withdrawals off chain back to Ethereum.      For some users, the chief advantage may be moving around different parts of the value stack without needing to pass through Ethereum, where gas fees can often make even routine transactions prohibitively expensive.      ""We have a lot of users who call it the ETH-Floor Lava Game, trying to hop between all these systems without touching Ethereum,"" Bhuptani said.      That said, Bhuptani said Connext is fundamentally about building out the Ethereum ecosystem and making it more useful. His team will be prioritizing building out connections to Ethereum and rollups and sidechains built to complement Ethereum.      ""We think that's where the majority of usage is going to be at least for the next couple of years,"" Bhuptani said, though he added that others could also connect on their own. ""It's not very difficult for people to plug in support for Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana. We expect it will happen,"" he added.      Lasse Clausen, a partner at 1kx, said in a statement.    ""The adoption of various L1 and L2 technologies is leading to an increasingly fragmented landscape of applications, liquidity and user experiences. Connext has been quietly building the glue for this ecosystem and is now ready to support the massive demand for cross-chain applications.""",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI,ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC | BNB | DAI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/13/interoperability-project-connext-raises-12m-from-1kx-consensys,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ecf88e614ca7f7cde0021c7ca510f22f2eda1fc4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Notable angels such as ex-Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, Aave founder Stani Kulechov, Terra founder Do Kwon and Messari’s Ryan Selkis also joined the round.      The nascent crypto economy is a dynamic and changing thing. “Real-time dynamic balances,” where financial parties can easily set up money streams from one to another, provides the foundation for a new generation of decentralized applications to bloom, according to Superfluid CEO Francesco George Renzi.      “With one interaction on-chain you can initiate a perpetual payment,” Renzi said in an interview, adding:    “Things like subscriptions have never taken off in crypto, while in Web 2 every online business is a subscription business. Money streaming is futuristic and aligned with crypto ethos, and can help the crypto native economy to flourish.”    Because Superfluid only requires one transaction to initiate a stream, there are no additional gas or transaction costs (the most used types of assets will be stablecoins like USDC), Renzi added. And unlike state channels, users don’t have to lock up assets or keep the full balance of a stream in a wallet, but are able to top-up balances as assets are streamed, he said.      “Streaming payments – meaning from one account to another, and then to others, concurrently, all in real time – has long been the Holy Grail of decentralized finance,” Kyle Samani, Multicoin’s managing partner, said in a statement. “State channels were thought to be the solution but by definition cannot scale due to the ‘locked assets’ problem and the capital inefficiency of design.”",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/13/superfluid-raises-9m-for-a-new-take-on-streaming-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f533001a21fd4fdf3006660371deda304bc8d8a0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387229,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBm9Jr,1626179766,US June Consumer Price Index Rose Faster Than Expected,"The U.S. Consumer Price Index jumped by 5.4% in the 12 months through June, exceeding the 4.9% increase expected by economists.      Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 4.5% year over year, also higher than economists’ expectations of a 4% increase. On a month-to-month basis, consumer prices rose 0.9%, higher than the expected 0.5%, and accelerating from May's 0.6% pace. Excluding food and energy, the index also rose 0.9% on the month.      The CPI report, released Tuesday by the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), shows an economy that’s working through supply constraints while trying to meet increasing demand as the country reopens, with business lockdowns ending and coronavirus vaccines reaching more people.      This was the fastest one-month increase since June 2008, according to the Labor Department.      ""Many of the same indexes continued to increase, including used cars and trucks, new vehicles, airline fares and apparel,"" the Labor Department wrote. ""The index for medical care and the index for household furnishings and operations were among the few major component indexes which decreased in June.""      Used car prices will reverse, said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon.      ""Auction prices soared in the spring because rental companies had to rebuild their fleets quickly to meet rebounding demand, but had to buy used vehicles at auction because the chip shortage meant they could not find sufficient numbers of new vehicles,"" Shepherdson said. ""This drove up auction prices, and the increase has then been magnified by dealers taking the opportunity to add extra margin on top. But auction prices dipped in June, and the next few months likely will bring steep declines as the fleet buyers leave the market.”      Rising rents caused shelter costs to rise 0.5% month over month.      ""Rents are the biggest element of the core CPI, accounting for 41% of the index, and they are now rising slightly faster"" than before COVID-19, Shepherdson added. ""We expect a further gradual acceleration, given the surge in home prices, the low vacancy rate and faster wage growth""      The CPI report is particularly important for some cryptocurrency investors who view bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.

""I think with the economy growing at 7% and the [coronavirus] pandemic coming under better and better control, I think the time is right to pull back emergency measures,"" Bullard told The Wall Street Journal in an interview on Monday, adding that continued purchases risk overheating the housing market. ""I am a little bit concerned that we’re feeding into an incipient housing bubble,"" he said.      The Federal Reserve has been buying bonds worth $120 billion a month ever since financial markets crashed in March 2020 on fears of coronavirus-induced recession. The unprecedented stimulus triggered risk-taking across all corners of the global financial market, including bitcoin. The leading cryptocurrency charted a sixfold rally to over $60,000 from October 2020 to April 2021.      Taper talk, therefore, is considered bearish for the cryptocurrency. However, bitcoin is barely moving on Bullard's comments, published by WSJ a few minutes before press time, and continues to trade lackluster near $33,200.      The policymaker has made similar comments in recent weeks, saying the impending unwinding of stimulus may not be on autopilot like the taper exercise conducted in 2014.      While the policymaker revealed his taper bias on Monday, he assured that the central bank would be extra careful while pulling back stimulus. ""We do want to do it gently and carefully, but I think we’re in a very good position to start a taper. I don’t need to get going tomorrow, but I think we’re in very good shape for this once the collective membership of the (rate-setting) Federal Open Market Committee is ready to act,"" Bullard said.      Also read: Money Reimagined: Inflation Is Here? Always Has Been      The Fed surprised markets last month by unexpectedly bringing forward the timing of the first interest rate hike to 2023. While the central bank has maintained that the recent rise in inflation could be transitory, economists surveyed by WSJ expect prices to remain sticky on the higher side for some time.      The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report for June is due to be released on Tuesday. The data is expected to show the cost of living rose 4.9% year on year in June, following May's 5% rise, according to FXStreet.

42387230,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBm9Nd,1626170885,Bitcoin's Range Play Likely to End With Bullish Breakout: Analyst,"An analyst who predicted the bitcoin mid-May price slide says the cryptocurrency's current range play is likely to be resolved on the higher side.      ""The consolidation phase itself is neutral, but we think a breakout is more likely than a breakdown,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a research note published on Monday. ""Intermediate-term momentum has been improving based on the MACD histogram.""      Bitcoin has been trading between $30,000 and $40,000 since late May. The price range has narrowed further in the past two weeks, with bulls unwilling to send prices above $36,000 and sellers refusing to step in below $32,000.      A big move looks overdue and could be bullish, as the weekly chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, has turned higher, having bottomed out in mid-June.      The consecutive shallow bars below the zero line indicate seller exhaustion.      The stochastic indicator continues to indicate oversold conditions with a below-20 print. ""Intermediate-term oversold conditions have generated stabilization above $30,000, which has proven to be strong support for bitcoin,"" Stockton said.      According to Stockton, the expected breakout would be confirmed on consecutive daily UTC closes above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $35,500. That would open the doors to the next resistance level, near $44,000.      Also read: Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops as Traders Await June CPI Inflation Report      The 50-day SMA is one of the most widely-tracked technical lines. Stockton mentioned it as the level to defend for the bulls back in April, when prices were trading well above average. The SMA support was breached on April 20 and was followed by a sell-off in May.      At press time, bitcoin is trading little changed on the day near $33,200. A break below the long-held support at $30,000 could invite chart-driven sellers. However, Stockton sees a low probability of a range breakdown.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/13/bitcoins-range-play-likely-to-end-with-bullish-breakout-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d25454451453ddaa947fc16b5694eaea4becd5f3-1500x797.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
