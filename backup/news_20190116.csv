42402450,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJrvi,1547668808,Grin Mining Launch Draws Interest From Deep-Pocketed Investors,"Grin, a new privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, has long drawn the interest of cypherpunks. But another group turned out in force to mine on the network that formally launched on Tuesday: investment firms.  ""We have been watching the whole show today. With maybe the most expensive genesis block one in history,"" Dovey Wan of Primitive Ventures told CoinDesk.  CoinDesk contacted several investors who were also closely watching yesterday's launch of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency, which is being developed using the technology known as mimblewimble.  Wan's partner at Primitive, Eric Meltzer, wrote about the Grin launch in his Proof of Work newsletter this week, noting:  ""There is (by our conservative estimates) 100 million dollars of mostly VC money invested into special-purpose investment vehicles to mine Grin. This does a lot of weird things: it turns a bunch of people who would have been buyers of grin into sellers of it, it changes the composition of the early holder roster, and it means the chain will launch with an extremely high degree of security via high PoW hashrate.""  Chris Dannen of Iterative Capital, a fund with a strong focus on mining, saw similar levels of interest.  ""Anecdotally, we know that a plurality of Chinese GPU farms are already hashing on these two networks,"" Dannen told CoinDesk in an email (Beam is the other network). Iterative is engaged in Grin mining, Dannen confirmed.  Why the demand?  “This is the thing that comes closest to bitcoin,” said a partner at a crypto investment firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""In a lot of investors’ minds it kind of pattern-matches to 'bitcoin 2.0.'”  The investor, whose firm pooled up with a group of other Tier 1 investors to mine Grin, says ""a perfect storm"" is stoking demand for Grin. For starters, it's a technology many early adopters are excited about, and there's also excess GPU and data-center capacity that miners are eager to point toward the Grin network.  The investor highlighted potential downsides, however, pointing out that Grin is designed to be highly inflationary in its first few years.  Though it has invested in the ecosystem, Primitive Ventures tells CoinDesk it is not mining Grin. Wan said the economics just don't look right yet.  This is a point that Josh Metnick, a mining entrepreneur, confirmed to CoinDesk. ""I would argue that it's already overmined,"" Metnick said.  Metnick's company, Random Crypto, is investing heavily in mining proof-of-work coins, with the thesis that a bear market is the right time to get into this business. That said, he's also made it something of a personal mission to make the assessment of mining's profitability more transparent, releasing a new mining return calculator to the public late last year.  Nevertheless, there's been a lot of interest in the Grin platform. Blockchain services startup BlockCypher, which has been a proponent of mimblewimble implementations for some time, confirmed as much to CoinDesk.  ""There's significant investor interest,"" CEO Catheryne Nicholson wrote in an email.  Knowledgeable sources told CoinDesk there were several large funds shopping for hash power in advance of Grin's launch. But they may be disappointed – while excited about the massive interest in a protocols she finds compelling, Wan doesn't think the early mining has been a wise move.  She wrote:  ""Grin won’t be profitable, especially early on.""  Zack Seward contributed reporting.

42402459,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJs4Z,1547660736,"'Critical' Vulnerability in Beam Wallet Could Have Put Funds At Risk, Devs Say After Fix","Developers behind the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Beam have revealed that the ""critical"" bug discovered and subsequently fixed in their wallet software last week could have put user funds directly at risk.  As stated in a Medium post published today, the vulnerability would have allowed an attacker to create “modified transactions” and subsequently send funds directly into the attacker's wallet.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Beam CTO Alex Romanov explained that by leveraging Beam’s Secure Bulletin Board System (SBBS) – a custom-built system to enable offline encrypted messaging between Beam wallets – attackers “currently listening in on active SBBS addresses … would be able to cause these wallets to send money to an attacker.”  Romanov stressed that the issue was application-specific and in no way related to the privacy-enhancing technology mimblewimble, saying:  “The vulnerability is not related to mimblewimble or cryptography or any underlying technology. Basically, it’s a bug in the application itself … It just affected the wallets because it would be possible to create this specific transaction.”  And though the existence of the vulnerability was disclosed to the public the same day it was found by Beam’s internal development team, the exact nature of the threat was not made public until today.  The reason for this according to Romanov was to prevent opening up any “possible attack vectors” for users who had not seen the announcement of the vulnerability last Wednesday.  Elaborating that people are “not online all the time, sometimes there are time differences, people may be asleep,” Romanov told CoinDesk that withholding further details was a way to buy time for users “especially pools and exchanges” to implement the code fix.  Speaking to the issued patch, Romanov explained that the fix was relatively simple.  “We have just prevented this specific scenario in which this custom transaction would have been accepted by a running wallet and that’s it,” said Romanov to CoinDesk.  The next upgrade  Beam officially launched on Thursday, January 3.

42402446,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJrrm,1547658007,US Lawmaker Reintroduces Bill Seeking 'Safe Harbor' for Some Crypto Startups,"U.S. Representative Tom Emmer wants to boost crypto companies which may be impacted by state-level money transmission laws with a bill aimed at creating exceptions for firms which do not store any coins.  House Resolution 528, which aims ""to provide a safe harbor from licensing and registration for certain non-controlling blockchain developers and providers of blockchain services,"" would allow companies which use or trade cryptocurrencies but do not hold users' coins to be exempt from money transmission laws if passed.  The bill is identical to one Emmer introduced last year with the 115th Congress, though there are a few key differences which may ensure its passage through the House – or at least give it a boost. The first is that unlike its previous iteration, the bill now has bipartisan support, a spokesperson for the Congressman told CoinDesk.  Representative Darren Soto, a Democrat, is now listed as a co-sponsor for the bill.  Further, ""this time around, this bill ... will be referred to the Financial Services committee which Congressman Emmer sits on, and we intend to see the House take up the measure,"" the spokesperson added.  D.C. advocacy group Coin Center noted previously that ""state money transmission licensing laws are broadly drafted and carry harsh penalties for failure to comply,"" after the bill was last introduced.  The key issue is that ""only custodians present a risk of loss that would be sensibly addressed through licensing,"" the group wrote at the time.  Through a spokesperson, Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito told CoinDesk that he hopes the bill will move through Congress, ""even though the Hill is focused on other priorities at the moment,"" adding:  ""We worked closely with Rep. Emmer and his staff to develop this bill last year and we’re very happy to see it reintroduced in this new Congress with bipartisan support.""  According to congress.gov, the bill has been referred to the Judiciary committee as well as the Financial Services committee, and each group will consider the provisions of the bill relevant to their mandates.

Google led Newspack's funding, with a $1.2 million investment, while ConsenSys contributed $350,000. The Lenfest Institute for Journalism and the John S. and James L.

Specifically, Civil's Publisher product, which allows newsrooms to permanently archive content on a decentralized network, will be installed as a plugin on the WordPress platform for any newsroom to use.  “The plugin will also act as a portal that will walk newsrooms through how to join the Civil Registry, the hub of community-vetted and -approved newsrooms,” the representative said, adding that it will also offer access to a ""discovery portal"" for consumers seeking news.

42402460,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJs5Y,1547645406,Bitwage Now Lets Firms Pay Salaried Staff in Crypto,"Bitwage is partnering with a payroll company to give more firms the ability to pay their workers in cryptocurrency.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Bitwage CEO Jonathan Chester says the partnership will let more U.S. employers fund payroll, payroll taxes and benefits with bitcoin or ether.  “This is a lifeline for companies to pay their people compliantly,” Chester told CoinDesk.  Bitwage currently has 45 active company clients. The partnership with Simply Efficient HR, a professional employer organization (PEO) based in Texas, is meant to expand the service beyond Bitwage’s current user base of 20,000.  Importantly, the new service lets companies pay salaried employees in crypto, rather than just contractors. The tax portion is converted into dollars and paid out in accordance with current tax systems in the U.S.  ""Previously you could pay contractors, but with W2 employees you would have to figure out how to fulfill your fiat obligations to the government regarding the tax processing,"" said Chester.  Peer-to-peer exchange company Paxful has been using the product in beta since November.  “Bitwage bridges the gap between bitcoin and the traditional finance system,” Hayel Abbassi, Paxful’s controller, said in a statement. “Paxful simply sends bitcoin to an address, and our employees receive net checks with the proper federal and state taxes withheld.”  Half of Bitwage’s existing customers are crypto-related and half use the service as a cross-border payment solution, according to Chester. He says the new product could benefit companies sitting on crypto reserves.  “If you work at a company where you do have banking issues, it’s pretty easy to see the value that cryptocurrency brings,” Chester told CoinDesk.  Founded in 2014, Bitwage is currently staffed by 11 full-time employees, some of whom get as much as 15 percent of their own wages in crypto, Chester said. The company raised $1 million in venture capital early on, including $760,000 from Draper Associates in 2015. In 2018, Draper also invested $1.25 million in OpenNode, a competing bitcoin payments startup that runs on the lightning network.  Bitwage is processing $2.5 million in monthly volume and is funded by revenues, Chester said, adding that the company is currently looking for expansion capital.

42402464,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJs6X,1547641827,"Genesis, BitGo Team Up to Ease Crypto Trading for Institutions","Cryptocurrency custodian BitGo and over-the-counter (OTC) specialist Genesis Global Trading have teamed up on a service designed to make Wall Street feel more comfortable dipping a toe in the market.  Announced today, the tie-up means institutional investors storing digital assets with BitGo can use Genesis’ platform to execute trades at the speed they are accustomed to in the traditional financial markets.  For example, if a client holds 100 bitcoin in their BitGo cold storage wallet, they can get a quote via Genesis and sell those bitcoins immediately. The moment the client agrees on the trade, BitGo locks up the 100 bitcoin and holds them to give to Genesis, which initiates a U.S. dollar bank wire to BitGo.  Once the wire goes through, the bitcoin transfer is settled on BitGo’s books, without anyone having to take the coins out of storage – which can take 24 hours or more – and without the transaction having to be recorded on the public ledger.  Michael Moro, CEO, Genesis Trading, explained:  “Because we have a BitGo Trust wallet ourselves, the coins are actually never leaving the BitGo system, just going from client to Bitgo to Genesis without ever being exposed to hot wallets and public blockchains.”  In addition to solving the time-lag cold storage issue, the BitGo/Genesis solution also aims to address the counterparty and settlement risk associated with some OTC crypto trading – what BitGo CEO Mike Belshe calls the “who goes first” problem.  In such scenarios, a buyer agrees to a price with a counterparty, who asks for the cash to be sent and then they will send millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. In Belshe’s view, this is just “crazy.”  “Nobody does this with any other asset class. Nobody wants to just wire someone that kind of money,” he said.  By expanding from pure custody into clearing and settlement, BitGo can show what is possible with crypto, Belshe added. “We can actually do real-time settlement; we can use digital tokens for dollars and we can use them for digital tokens that you trade. We can do swaps with zero counterparty risk.”  Yet BitGo is far from alone among custodians in moving in this direction.  Lightning for institutions  Indeed, the Genesis announcement follows a similar partnership unveiled late last year between BitGo’s rival custodian Kingdom Trust and trading firm OTCXN.  “The OTCXN platform is essentially a private blockchain where people go to make trades,” said Matt Jennings, CEO of Kingdom Trust (using the term “blockchain” figuratively). “We verify through that platform that the assets exist here, so you have a regulated entity verifying the assets are in cold storage.”  More recently, OTCXN signed up Nevada-based qualified custodian and crypto specialist Prime Trust, setting up the possibility of connecting different cold storage providers.  OTCXN CEO Rosario Ingargiola told CoinDesk he is also in the process of hooking up its blockchain and tokenizing infrastructure with a handful of top tier exchanges.  “It’s an extension of cold storage wallet and legacy account infrastructure. Every custodian on our network has a unique set of asset ledgers. Kingdom Trust and Prime Trust, for example, each have a unique dollar and bitcoin ledger per firm,” said Ingargiola, adding:  “You never have a public ledger transaction. It's kind of like the lightning network in that respect – except it works.”  Again, to be clear he did not literally mean a new protocol like bitcoin’s lightning network, just that OTCXN’s network allows for the type of speed and scale associated with industrial-sized algorithmic trading.  “The beauty of that is you can truly support high-frequency trading (HFT) in any digital asset using this paradigm,"" Ingargiola said. ""I think this is absolutely necessary to scale this market to the level where liquidity needs to be to get institutional investors and pension funds.”  Other institutional crypto platforms are thinking along similar lines as well, including Fidelity Digital Assets (FDAS), the custodian and brokerage soon to be launched by U.S. financial services powerhouse Fidelity Investments.  In an interview with CoinDesk late last year, Tom Jessop, head of FDAS, said that once it has a critical mass of clients whose orders it can match with each other, rather than using outside liquidity providers, it won’t have to move coins out of storage as much.  “If we’re able to cross two client orders, it’s effectively just a book transfer on our books and records,” said Jessop. “If we’re trading with an external counterparty, it involves the movement of assets. We can do both [external and internal transfers]. There is probably an efficiency benefit in the former case, where we can effect transactions between customers….It creates a little bit of attractiveness on the platform.”  Matt Johnson, co-founder of Digital Asset Custody Company, said he also looks forward to a point where speed to settlement is no longer an issue, from a cold storage perspective.  “We can go from cold storage to cold storage and there never needs to be another hot wallet. Everybody can throw away their hot wallets for institutional custody,” he said.  A role for stablecoins  Yet in the long term, Moro of Genesis said his preference would be using existing infrastructure and potentially leveraging stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to maintain parity with fiat – rather than holding out for adoption onto a layer 2 system.  For instance, this could work if Genesis and BitGo agreed to use a stablecoin as a medium of exchange, taking U.S. dollars out the equation. Rather than sending a bank wire to the BitGo customer selling their 100 bitcoin, as is the current plan, they would receive 100 bitcoin worth of a stablecoin in this scenario, said Moro.  Alternatively, BitGo could do a conversion out of the stablecoin and into dollars, he said. “That way, if a transaction happens on a weekend or on a holiday or overnight, we can still settle because we are not beholden to the bank hours.”  However, David Mercer, CEO of LMAX Exchange Group, that operates institutional crypto exchange LMAX Digital, said any such nuance of approach pales into insignificance next to the fundamental missing piece, which is a big bank coming in and being a trusted anchor for fiat/crypto trading.  Mercer’s firm also offers custody and instant ledger entries between trading counterparties without having to move coins. But he said this part isn’t really the problem; where the fiat comes in is the part that’s lacking, said Mercer.  “The coins bit is easy,"" he said. ""But the bulk of trading today still happens fiat versus coin. And fiat has to enter the system somehow. At the moment, clients have to use – I don't want to be too critical of them – banks without a very big balance sheet.”  Unfortunately, the HSBCs and JPMorgans of the world don’t want to touch digital businesses yet. But it is a “yet,” believes Mercer, who said he is in talks with banks in the U.K. regarding this, adding:  “When that happens, all of sudden when you will get the institutional money, the asset managers and pension funds, confident enough to park their money with an AA-rated or AAA-rated bank and trade.”  Yet Moro stated that asking banks to settle trades in crypto time, i.e. 24/7, 365 days a year, remains a big hurdle. Returning to the potential of stablecoins, he said a consortium of banks getting together and issuing their own stablecoin would be an optimal (and, he thinks, likely) solution.  “This would allow for existing banking guys to get involved. I think the creation/redemption process could be automated,” Moro said, concluding:  “The crypto community will have questions about it being centralized and still relying on the old financial system. But to be honest, that’s a stablecoin that will be worth a dollar.”  UPDATE (January 16 14:30 UTC): An earlier version of the headline for this article overstated the impact of the BitGo-Genesis service. It will result in faster trading, but not the nanosecond-fast definition of ""high-frequency trading.""

42402472,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJsAT,1547637618,Will Bitcoin's Price Extend Its Four-Year January Losing Streak?,"Bitcoin (BTC) has reported losses in January for the last four years, and a fifth now looks on the cards.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 32 percent, 14.6 percent, 0.10 percent and 26.64 percent in the first month of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Notably, the odds are stacked in favor of BTC extending the four-year January losing streak this year.  BTC fell 13 percent last week, signaling an end of the corrective bounce from the December low of $3,122. The sell-off reinforced the bearish view put forward by the downward sloping 10-week simple moving average. As a result, a drop to $3,122 in the next couple of weeks cannot be ruled out.  That said, the probability of BTC beating the trend this month would rise if the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-day moving average (MA), currently at $3,768, is convincingly scaled in the next few days. A breach there would strengthen the short-term bullish case.  As seen above, BTC's 32 percent drop in January 2015 marked an end of the four-year January winning streak.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,611 – down 2 percent from the monthly opening price of $3,689.  3-day chart  As seen above, BTC failed to cut through the 21-candle MA earlier this month, strengthening the bearish view put forward by the downward sloping line.  Further, the drop to $3,476 (Jan. 13 low) invalidated the bullish trend change signaled by an outside reversal candle on Dec 20.  As a result, the path of least resistance looks to be to the downside.  Daily chart  The 21-candle MA on the daily chart acted as strong support on multiple occasions before it was breached on Jan. 10.  The bearish pressure would weaken somewhat if prices cross back above the 21-candle MA, currently at $3,768, in the next day or two. That would boost the prospects of BTC closing above the monthly opening price of $3,689 on Jan. 31.  View  The odds of BTC extending its four-year January losing streak appear high currently.  BTC risks falling to $3,122 in the near-term, having validated the bearish 10-week MA with a 13 percent drop last week.  BTC could snap the losing streak if prices move above the 21-day SMA in the next couple of days.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The firm sent an email to customers on Tuesday, a copy of which was obtained by CoinDesk, which states that, while it had continued to operate in the two months since the bankruptcy filing, ""at present, both access and power to the facilities in which Giga Watt operates have been closed to the company.""  Andrey Kuzenny, a director owning a more than 10 percent stake in Giga Watt and an admin of the firm’s official Telegram channel, confirmed to CoinDesk that the email was sent by the firm.  When asked for further details, Kuzenny told CoinDesk he could not comment for legal reasons.  The email went on to say that those who have completed their know-your-customer verification will be able to withdraw any cryptocurrency remaining in their wallets until March.  One user on the firm's official Telegram channel asked Kuzenny if the firm can refund holdings of Giga Watt's WTT token ""with the original investment BTC,"" to which Kuzenny replied: “No, it’s not possible.""  Giga Watt will also be returning some mining equipment back to customers, according to the email. Those customers who had equipment removed before the lockout will be notified via email within the next two weeks. Others with equipment still trapped in the facilities will not be notified and any further information “will not be known, or available, pending current legal proceedings,” according to the letter.  The company pledged to keep customers updated if and when the situation changes.  Giga Watt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy at a court in the Eastern District of Washington back in November. According to court documents seen by CoinDesk at the time, the firm owes its biggest 20 unsecured creditors nearly $7 million, including around $800,000 to electricity providers.  Within a week of its initial bankruptcy filing, the firm hiked the value of its assets in a revised statement to $10 million and $50 million, far higher than the previously stated $0–$50,000 range.

42402452,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJryf,1547615152,"Ford, LG to Pilot IBM Blockchain in Fight Against Child Labor","IBM has announced two separate projects that aim to track supply chains for the metals industry using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform.  One is designed to track cobalt traveling from a mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo to a Ford Motor Company plant, while the other seeks to monitor the shipping of metals from a mine in Mexico.  In the first project, a 1.5 ton batch of cobalt will leave the mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo next month, travel to get refined in China, then to a battery plant in Korea and end up in the U.S. at the Ford plant as a battery for an electric car. The trip, lasting about five months, will be recorded on the blockchain, IBM said.  Aside from IBM and Ford, this pilot involves the Chinese cobalt mining company Huayou Cobalt, power elements producer LG Chem (a unit of South Korean conglomerate LG Corp.) and the tech company RCS Global. The participants will maintain a permissioned blockchain built by IBM on Fabric to register each step of the metal's journey.  The aim is to make sure that on each stop of the supply chain, participants can check that the material was sourced according to the standards of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), IBM's general manager for global industrial products Manish Chawla told CoinDesk.  The Democratic Republic of Congo is infamous for using child labor at cobalt mines, and the industry, which supplies the raw materials that go into consumer electronics and electric cars, has attracted the attention of human rights groups.  ""Blockchain is the most effective technology to provide a real-time access to all the due diligence processes, provide visibility to the supply chain from the miners to the market,"" Chawla said. ""Our role in IBM is that we are bringing people together for this project and developing the platform.""  Tag it on the ground  So how exactly can a blockchain verify whether the material was mined ethically? As often is the case with off-chain assets, this project will have to trust humans to input correct data.  Some of the humans in question work for IBM's partner, RCS Global, which has been monitoring practices in metal mines in Africa for several years now. In its normal course of business, the company sends its employees to small mining sites to look for illegal practices and physically put bar code tags on the bags of ore, registering that it was mined with no violation of the law, Jonathan Ellermann, a project director at RCS Global, told CoinDesk.  If a monitor detects illegal activity, like child labor, this will be recorded in the system, RCS headquarters gets an alert and informs exporters who work with this mine that the batch they are about to ship no longer meets international guidelines, Ellermann said. ""Either the sourcing goes away from this site, or the prevention practices are put back in place,"" Ellermann said.  Last year, for example, at one of the gold mines monitored by RCS, it had to inform the exporter of a violation, he said. ""What ultimately happened is that the exporter walked away from that site.""  However, in the blockchain pilot, there is an additional layer of trust involved.  Since the initial monitoring will take place on an industrial, ""responsible"" mining site, Ellermann said, the RCS monitors won't need to be there full-time. Rather, RCS will be auditing information provided by the management of the mine, whose employees will do the tagging. While the barcode tags will correspond to the assets on the distributed ledger, the audit reports will be stored off-chain on an IBM server.  Long-term plan  IBM began working with RCS Global last year, Chawla said. ""They know how the supply chain audit needs to be put in place, understand the civil mapping side of the supply chain, and we understand the digital side of it.""  At the pilot stage, each participant will maintain its own node as a validator, he said, but as more companies join, they will also have the option to have their node supported for them by IBM.  The Hyperledger technology will allow the participants to choose which information is available only for their partners and which can be seen by outside parties like NGOs, Chawla said. Regulators and government bodies also should be able to view the information recorded in the system; the rules of involvement for third parties will be worked out as the project proceeds.  If the pilot succeeds, IBM expects other supply chain audit companies (tracing various raw materials used for batteries, including minerals tantalum, tin, tungsten, gold and rare earth), automakers and electronics manufacturers to join the project, Chawla said.  This is not the first blockchain project related to cobalt mining — last month, Overstock's tZERO announced it was working on a security token for trading cobalt with private equity firm GSR Capital.  Beyond cobalt  In the other metals project announced Wednesday, IBM is working with a Canadian tech startup called MineHub Technologies; mining companies Goldcorp, Wheaton Precious Metals and Kutcho Copper; metal trading company Ocean Partners USA; and ING Bank.  MineHub is planning to build a platform on Hyperledger Fabric to trace the metal concentrate from Goldcorp’s Penasquito Mine in Mexico. The system would allow the mining company to upload data about the ore it mines, including certification that the material was produced in a sustainable and ethical way, according to IBM.  As the materials are transported, new pieces of information can be added to the system as transactions, so that regulators will be able to verify the data, as well as end users.  ""Smart contracts for supply chain processes such as trade finance, streaming and royalty contracts will be used by companies such as Wheaton Precious Metals and other institutions who provide credit facilities such as ING bank,"" IBM's press release says.

42402457,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJs3a,1547596842,Game of Coins: Inside the Paxos-Gemini Stablecoin Discount War,"The rise of new stablecoins was a defining story in the second half of 2018, but the reality is that exclusive discounts partly fueled their growth.  Dollar-backed stablecoins are generally supposed to be worth $1, whether it’s Gemini’s GUSD or Paxos’ PAX. But according to four sources with knowledge of these cryptocurrency exchanges, both stablecoin-issuers privately offered over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks up to a 1 percent discount if traders used these tokens in some fashion before redeeming them for USD.  “They were offering that as a sweetener for getting it kick-started with adoption,"" an OTC trader, who asked to stay anonymous, told CoinDesk.  This is why GUSD and PAX activity surged in December 2018, both between OTC desks and on exchange platforms like Huobi and Binance, where several traders moved millions of dollars within a matter of days. According to CoinMarketCap, GUSD’s global market cap suddenly surged from roughly $87 million on December 17 to over $103 million the following day.  “A lot of the arbitrage opportunities were manufactured,” the OTC trader added.  Dorothy Chang, VP of Paxos’ marketing and communications department, told CoinDesk this incentive structure was only offered to a “handful of partners” for “less than two months” starting around late September. Perhaps fortuitously for Paxos, the first-ever U.S.-dollar-pegged stablecoin, Tether (USDT), temporarily lost parity in mid-October.  According to a report prepared for CoinDesk by the analytics firm Delphi Digital, USDT lost almost a third of its market share during this period, with GUSD eventually exceeding PAX with more than $140 million in transaction volume in January 2019.  The Delphi Digital report argued that “competitors are all fighting for the spot Tether will most likely eventually lose.”  With regards to PAX, Chang said the discount was “something we did when we were first introducing our product to the market,” adding that Paxos is increasing its redemption windows from once to twice a day and looking for more partnerships with enterprises across the space.  “We’ve been at above $100 million in daily transaction volume for the past three days and holding steady,” Chang said on Monday.  While Paxos has moved on, the markets may still witness ripple effects from these corporate incentive programs for months to come. GUSD, for example, saw a burst of trading activity and market valuation in January.  “The incentives that are issued by these entities often come with a lock-up period. Those may have expired,” said Jesse Proudman, CEO of the algorithmic trading platform Strix Leviathan. Proudman explained to CoinDesk that the discounted stablecoins can now be freely traded.  Game of coins  Once several stablecoins became available for less than or more than a dollar, whether based on incentive strategies or organic market fluctuations, the arbitrage games began.  According to a Paxos blog and reporting by The Block, several Huobi users tried to obfuscate their source of funds by opening dozens of accounts using other names in order to exceed Huobi's daily USD redemption limit. Paxos told CoinDesk at least 10 accounts were closed in relation to this trend.  The frenzy arose because the PAX discount program coincided with the release of HUSD, which is essentially a pool of stablecoins offered by the Singapore-based exchange Huobi that allows traders to deposit one type and later withdraw another. Besides GUSD and PAX, the pool also supports Circle’s USDC and TrustToken’s TUSD.  According to Kelvy Ko, partner at crypto hedge fund Leotank Digital Trading, Huobi’s HUSD pool has made it much more convenient for traders to swap stablecoins and leverage arbitrage without actually trading them.  Indeed, around the same time that the stablecoin USDT oscillated and Huobi launched HUSD, PAX’s global market cap jumped from roughly $42 million to $79 million in a single day on October 23. Then in early December, Binance saw a plethora of multimillion-dollar PAX trades as traders struggled to find liquidity and arbitrage sources beyond the redeemer itself. (Paxos later told CoinDesk that ""traders have never struggled to find liquidity in PAX markets."") By the first week of 2019, Paxos told CoinDesk the company had redeemed $200 million worth of stablecoins so far.  Even so, there could be a long way to go until the regulator-approved stablecoins like PAX and GUSD catch up to USDT in terms of volume.  “Even though USDT is wash traded, it has the first mover advantage,” Ko said, referring to how some USDT users allegedly buy and sell the same financial instrument to create the artificial appearance of marketplace activity. Plus, this practice is hardly restricted to USDT and might currently be applied by some traders to other stablecoins as well.  “Even if USDT is in a legal grey area, it is hard for others to compete because some people want to avoid the regulators,” Ko added.  Gemini declined to comment on this specific incentive program or transaction volumes across global exchanges. According to the company’s blog and a recent regulation-friendly marketing campaign, Gemini seeks to distinguish itself from the competition by being “a compliance-centric company.”  When asked if incentive programs artificially inflated the respective coin’s market cap, Chang of Paxos said:  ""That may have been true for some, but we have not been optimizing for market cap alone; it's not meaningful by itself. What is meaningful is transaction volume. For us, the point of offering an incentive was to develop market depth.""  Windows of opportunity  One of the anonymous OTC traders CoinDesk spoke with said that stablecoin issuers were inspired to launch this short-lived campaign because there isn’t an organic demand for these assets.  “The banks and the other [crypto] OTC desks we work with are really incredibly flexible,” the trader said. “It’s much easier to do that [work with the bank] than to...get back these tokens that have a bunch of strings attached and also doesn’t pay any interest.”  On the other hand, Proudman of Strix Leviathan told CoinDesk his company uses PAX for large-scale trades on Binance – sans backroom discounts – because he prefers to hold a regulated asset that can be redeemed for dollars.  “We elect to not use the incentive strategies from any of the stablecoin companies,” Proudman said, adding his firm uses stablecoins for arbitrage related to bitcoin, ethereum and other trading pairs. “From a trader’s perspective, we find ourselves electing to use coins we are comfortable with over those that we are less comfortable with.”  However, since stablecoin issuers require a significant amount of know-your-customer information in order to redeem the tokens, the anonymous trader said OTC desks that participated in the rush may have revealed competitive information about their partners and trading volumes to the exchanges, namely Gemini and Paxos – an assessment that Paxos disputed following the publication of this report, arguing that such information is only used for compliance purposes and that it wouldn't be used competitively by the exchange.  “These smaller desks can’t get banked at the places that allow instant U.S. dollar transfer, so they are willing to give up some of their privacy,” Proudman said.  The second anonymous trader agreed that this opportunity was especially appealing to OTC desks with liquidity challenges, often related to jurisdictional compliance. Because of that, he expects companies to continue issuing stablecoins, perhaps with more promotional discounts, in 2019.  “I think there is no clear winner yet, both in terms of traders and issuers,” he said.  According to Ko, the regulated stablecoin arbitrage opportunity closed after several weeks because “once the short-term interests [were] achieved, they don’t need to keep the aggressive promotional rebates.”  Plus, a Huobi Global representative told CoinDesk that the exchange added the daily withdrawal limits during the timeframe of this incident.  For PAX traders in particular, the limits are now $20,000 for verified accounts and $1,000 for unverified users. The arbitrage rush may have impacted Huobi’s coffers, with three Huobi wallets holding roughly 78 percent of all GUSD in circulation. Gemini declined to comment on why that might be.  Moving forward, the Huobi Global representative said the exchange plans to “dynamically develop HUSD over the course of 2019” in order to improve the user experience and prevent misuse of the system.
