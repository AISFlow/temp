42394309,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbRD3,1644450753,"To Improve Crypto Gaming, Developers Should Look Back in Time","Game developers have solved staking, liquidity pooling and other aspects of blockchain technology, but they are still whiffing on the gaming part of their projects.  They focus too much on token implementation. If we want to expand the metaverse, developers must do better. Pre-blockchain games that were wildly popular may offer at least a partial road map for them to follow.  Zach Hungate is director of gaming at Everyrealm (formerly Republic Realm), a metaverse innovation and investment company.  Here’s what current game developers should do to propel the industry.  In 2020, gaming on the blockchain was truly revolutionary. Axie Infinity’s popularity skyrocketed, mainstreaming the play-to-earn model for a world forced to work remotely. Fueled by innovation, the industry’s trading volume surged 8,300% year-over-year, pushing the market capitalization to nearly $30 billion.  Read More: Axie Infinity Finds Ready Players in Hyperinflation-Racked Venezuela  Fast forward one year and everything looks … roughly the same.  Sure, there are more crypto games today, but scroll through dAppRadar, and you’ll notice that the majority of blockchain games are either “tap-and-wait” idle-clickers, thinly veiled yield farmers or generic collectible card games. If crypto gaming purports to be a driving force behind the metaverse, why are most blockchain games entirely one dimensional?  Blockchain technology has the potential to empower players in an unprecedented fashion, enfranchising users as partners with financial compensation and governance ability. However, these factors alone cannot drive mass adoption when the games themselves lack depth and immersion.  How many blockchain games have lore or world building? Where is the community-driven content and engagement on social media? It’s difficult to even find YouTube or Twitch gameplay of crypto games that supposedly have hundreds of thousands of users.  Crypto gaming is saturated with re-skinned versions of early iOS and social network games. Alien Worlds, Upland and Bomb Crypto all heavily limit gameplay with cool-down timers, arbitrary action limits and depleting features similar to energy or stamina. Farmers World and Sunflower Farmers are carbon copies of the original FarmVille. These titles all relinquished playable content in favor of the ability to mint NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and exchange native tokens for in-game currency. But blockchain should be an augmenting, not a primary, feature for a successful game.  To that end, Web 3 games will require a healthy balance of on-chain and off-chain features. In a fully on-chain architecture, recurrent, expensive transaction fees can negatively impact gameplay for small activities, particularly if the game is built on a busy ecosystem like Ethereum.  Developers also face unique challenges in using blockchain technology, such as whether game features will enable token manipulation and arbitrage opportunities, or otherwise be impacted by market forces that are part of the in-game economy. Introducing off-chain gameplay allows developers to deploy useful aspects of the blockchain, while avoiding its drawbacks.  Looking back to go forward  For the industry to progress, gaming studios need to look backward to legacy developers. Open world Web 2.0 video games like Roblox and Minecraft offer players unrestricted environments that they can customize, resulting in ecosystems where users and independent developers generate much of the in-game content.  Read More:What Is Web 3 and Why Is Everyone Talking About It?  For example, Minecraft servers may use third-party plug-ins to establish decentralized virtual economies, enforce basic land and property rights, and create internal governance structures. Simultaneously, these virtual worlds have grown alongside the player base, allowing players to discover new items, areas and strategies and to independently bring them to the community. On the blockchain, this would mean that assets for sale in exchanges or marketplaces should always be player created or earned.  Which they aren’t.  Over the last two decades, the world’s largest games (e.g. League of Legends, Fortnite, World of Warcraft) grew on the freemium model, where users have limited game access at no cost and pay premiums to receive additional in-game features. This model gives users a way to trial the game before paying anything, an important distinction between today’s crypto games and what has worked in the past.  There are rumblings that major studios will solve the industry’s problems in their releases. But, with current projections pushing AAA (large studio) blockchain game releases as far out as 2024, is the industry meant to stagnate in the interim?  Independent studios or user-modified forks of big box games drive gaming innovation. The entire MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genre and esports scene spawned from a player-made custom map for StarCraft and a community-developed mod for Warcraft 3.  Don’t be caught off guard when the dominant blockchain game of the next decade arises from a small studio before the AAA gaming brands ever publish a pixel.

Cryptocurrencies that have fallen off their highs over the past three weeks appear to be on an upward trajectory again. Crypto winter is thawing as crypto markets are showing some signs of life. For example, Bitcoin, which fell 52% from its November highs to a low of around $33,000, has gained 15% in the past seven days, and Ethereum, which dropped 55% from its all-time high, has rebounded 13%.

42396062,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0djc,1644449295,First Mover Asia: Cryptos Turn Green on Red-Letter Russia News,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin steadied above $44,000, and the broader crypto market ended in higher.  Technician's take: BTC buyers have defended intraday support levels, although upside appears limited.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $44,475 +0.6%  Ether (ETH): $3,241 +3.4%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC +8.5% Smart Contract Platform XRP XRP +6.3% Currency Polygon MATIC +5.2% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  ""There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,587 +1.4%  DJIA: 35,768 +0.8%  Nasdaq: 14,490 +2%  Gold: $1,833 +1.3%  Market moves  Bitcoin (BTC) traded steadily above $44,000, following news that the Russian government decided to regulate cryptocurrencies instead of ban them.  At the time of publication, the oldest cryptocurrency is changing hands above $44,475, up less than a percentage point over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Meanwhile, ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at above $3,241, a 3.4% increase over the same time period.  One analyst said bitcoin’s gains came after the Russian government released a document on its official website late Tuesday setting principles for crypto regulation.  “What makes this decision all the more important is that the central bank also is on board,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA the Americas, wrote in his newsletter. “Russia appears poised to recognize cryptocurrencies as a form of currency. Anytime a major [b]itcoin country embraces cryptos, that is great news for the cryptoverse.”  As CoinDesk reported, the Russian government’s plan received support from its central bank, which had earlier called for a ban on crypto mining and trading. The development also came not long after India took a step toward crypto legalization with a tax on digital asset transfers.  Following bitcoin, most cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinDesk also ended in the green on Wednesday.  Moya added that as bitcoin’s price has steadied, many retail traders have started feeling more comfortable investing in alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  Moya said the market will need “a major catalyst” or fresh new capital to send the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization above $50,000.  Data complied by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin's trading volume across centralized exchanges on Wednesday was down from a day ago.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Recovering Between $40K Support and $46K Resistance  Bitcoin (BTC) is recovering from a slight pullback on Wednesday as buyers maintain intraday support levels. The cryptocurrency was trading around $44,500 at press time and could face resistance at $46,800.  BTC is up 3% over the past 24 hours and, on average, spot trading volume is starting to rise, albeit still below January highs, according to CoinDesk data.  For now, technical indicators are improving and do not signal extreme overbought conditions. That could keep buyers active into the Asian trading day so long as immediate support at $42,000 holds.  The downward-sloping 50-day moving average, currently at $42,689, is gradually turning upward, which could indicate a bullish shift. Still, upside appears limited given negative momentum on longer-term charts.  Important events  8 a.m. HKT/SGT (12 a.m. UTC): Australia consumer inflation expectations (Feb.)

42396064,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0dla,1644449246,Crypto Tax Pros Throw Cold Water on Staking Excitement,"A possible settlement in an ongoing legal case may not precedence make.  Crypto Twitter’s staking community was thrown into a tizzy last week after several media outlets breathlessly reported that an update in an ongoing lawsuit against U.S. the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could mean the agency was setting precedent: that it would not tax unsold staking rewards as income.  Some Twitter users celebrated the news the IRS offered a settlement to a Tennessee couple, Josh and Jessica Jarrett, who sued the agency for a refund on taxes they paid in 2019 on Tezos staking rewards, as a victory for crypto stakers everywhere.  Tax and policy experts on Twitter, however, were quick to cast doubt on the news, calling some of the reports misleading and arguing that it could cause confusion that would lead to risky tax decisions.  Last week’s furor was far from the first time the crypto community has disagreed over taxes. Even for the experts, crypto taxes can be confusing – and the confusion has been compounded by the notoriously tight-lipped IRS’ reluctance to issue clarifying guidance. Crypto investors and tax professionals have come up with their own strategies for dealing with the uncertainty, ranging from conservatively reporting everything to reporting nothing, and hoping for the best.  However, even in a climate that fosters disagreement, crypto tax experts were nearly unanimous in their reaction that the settlement offer in the Jarrett’s case did not, as reported, set a precedent for other taxpayers. Nor did it indicate a change in the IRS’ stance towards staking rewards taxes – at least, as things currently stand.  Is a settlement a precedent?  The Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA), a blockchain industry group that has financially supported the Jarretts’ case, issued a press release on Feb. 3 arguing the IRS’ settlement offer is a sign the agency recognizes it has a losing argument.  Legal counsel for the Jarretts declined the IRS’ offer to issue a $3,793 refund, plus statutory interest, on the taxes they paid on Tezos staking rewards in 2019.  By rejecting the offer, the Jarretts and their attorneys – as well as POSA and the case’s other financial backers – are hoping to force the IRS’ hand, either by pushing the slow-moving agency to issue guidance on staking or by securing a judge’s ruling that could be used to set a precedent for other taxpayers.  However, not all tax attorneys see things that way.  Matt Foreman, a New York City-based tax lawyer who frequently works with crypto investors, doesn’t think the case has much, if any, bearing on crypto taxes – even if it does push forward to a trial.  “Fundamentally, I think this is nothing,” Foreman told CoinDesk. “I understand why it's exciting, I understand why people are interested in it. I just don’t think this says anything, and I don’t think it does anything.”  Foreman said that even if the Jarretts succeed in getting a ruling from a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee (MDTN), where the case was brought, it would not set precedent outside of that district.  “If you have a case that’s decided in the MDTN, it’s only binding on people who live in the MDTN or transactions that happened in the MDTN,” Foreman said.  If the case does end up in front of a federal judge in the MDTN, and either side appeals the judge’s decision, Foreman explained the precedent could apply to a larger group of people but would still not be binding for all taxpayers.  “Conversely, if you go to Tax Court and the IRS wins or the taxpayer wins, it is binding for everyone,” Foreman explained.  Because the Jarretts paid their taxes on the staking rewards, Foreman said they would have been unable to try the case in Tax Court.  Foreman took issue with media analysis (including CoinDesk’s) that the settlement offer was a sign of the IRS’ shifting position.  “I think that’s categorically false,” Foreman said. “The IRS could issue a statement saying, ‘We agree with the taxpayer and we’re not pushing on this anymore,’ and they overtly didn’t do that. Their entire statement has been, ‘We’re just refunding the money, we’re not litigating,’ and that’s it.”  Despite pushback, POSA remains enthusiastic about the Jarretts’ case and its potential to set a legal precedent for staking taxes.  “We think it’s important to bring awareness to the legal arguments being made in the case,” said POSA board member Alison Mangiero. “The fact that the argument being made is reasonable and backed by over 100 years of tax law, and that, in our opinion, this early concession by the government indicates not only that Jarretts’ position is reasonable but that it is correct as a matter of law.”  For Foreman, however, the IRS settlement offer isn’t a sign of agreement, but rather the likely result of a decision to save money on mounting litigation costs. Foreman said if it indicated anything else it was that the IRS is thinking “long term and strategically” about crypto staking.  Seth Wilks, tax director for crypto tax giant TaxBit, agreed.  “What happened is the IRS simply came out and said ‘Look, the issue before the court is whether or not you get a refund, and if we give you a refund the case is dead in the water – it just goes away’,” Wilks told CoinDesk. “And so, from a precedent-setting standard, there is no court ruling, there’s nothing to stand behind it.”  However, Wilks said the case isn’t useless – by forcing the IRS to consider the issues presented in the case, the Jarretts and POSA have “put this on the front burner of the IRS,” which could speed up the process of issuing clarifying guidance.  Risks of under-reporting  Foreman, Wilks and other tax experts expressed concern the excitement generated by the Jarretts’ case could lead people to file their taxes incorrectly – leading to penalties and potential legal issues down the road.  “For my clients, I’m going to tell them that they should continue to declare [staking rewards] as ordinary income, it should be viewed as if it’s interest,” Foreman told CoinDesk. “That way, they don’t get caught … Were [the IRS] to catch you, they are going to rake you over the coals – and it’s not going to be a good result for the taxpayer. It’s going to be very, very bad.”  Foreman said that, if caught, the IRS could allege fraud – which has no statute of limitations and has higher interest penalties – and, if a taxpayer was large enough, potential criminal penalties.  “I would very strongly recommend taking a conservative position and not overstating the results in this unique situation,” Foreman said.  James Yochum, a Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based certified public accountant (CPA) who specializes in crypto taxes, is also advising his clients to take a more conservative approach in order to avoid accruing penalties.  “If a taxpayer omits staking rewards from their tax return completely, there’s a possibility of them being hit with an accuracy-related penalty, in addition to a failure-to-pay penalty, and interest on the outstanding debt,” Yochum told CoinDesk.  Yochum explained that, because the IRS can wait several years to audit, these penalties have the potential to snowball into enormous sums.  Not all crypto CPAs are concerned about the risk of penalties, however.  For Clinton Donnelly, the founder of CryptoTaxAudit, the lack of regulatory clarity is, at least for now, an unavoidable part of crypto investing.  “When it comes to crypto taxation, there’s a lot of gray. Most people want there to be black and white, and it simply isn’t black and white,” Donnelly told CoinDesk.  Donnelly works with his clients to understand the level of risk they’re willing to take, and offers them options for how to pay their crypto taxes. Even before the Jarrett case, Donnelly was advocating for a method of reporting staking rewards that resulted in zero taxes at the time of receipt.  Donnelly told CoinDesk that, while this could result in mounting penalties in the event of an audit, audits are relatively rare and he believes many of the penalties can be waived by filing disclosure forms when preparing taxes.  “Life is full of accepting risks,” Donnelly said. “As long as you’re willing to pay the bill, then I believe it’s a reasonable risk under the law.”  Whether they agree if staking rewards should be taxed as income or not, all the tax experts were unanimous in their agreement that crypto taxpayers should seek professional advice when doing their taxes.  “Friends don’t let friends take tax advice from Twitter,” Wilks joked.  Wen guidance?  The IRS’ silence on staking rewards has been frustrating for many in the industry, but experts think it could still take years to get clarity.  Foreman told CoinDesk he thinks the IRS could issue guidance within the next two to three years.  “The issue is that cryptocurrency is moving so fast, that by the time [the IRS] feels comfortable releasing something, things have changed and new things have happened. What they need to do is really extend resources and time and really build something out that is very thorough,” Foreman said.  The IRS has issued two pieces of crypto-related formal guidance. The first, issued in 2014, provided guidance about income generated via proof-of-work mining. In 2019, the agency released a FAQ on the tax implications of things like hard forks and airdrops that sought to expand on its 2014 guidance. Many tax experts, however, complained that the guidance raised more questions than it answered.  “They can’t keep doing the piecemeal thing they’re doing right now, that’s not helpful to anyone, really,” Foreman concluded.

Revenue of $20 million was up about 93% from the previous quarter, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation (EBITDA) of $14.3 million was up more than 156%; adjusted EBITDA margin of 72% rose from 54% previously.  The revenue and EBITDA gains are thanks to a 97% quarterly jump in operating hashrate to 685 PH/s and the resultant 51% rise in bitcoins mined to 364, combined with the higher average price of bitcoin during the October quarter.  The company said construction at its Mackenzie facility in British Columbia is ahead of schedule, with commissioning of the first 0.3 EH/s expected early in the second quarter this year followed by full ramp up to 1.5 EH/s in Q3. Another British Columbia facility, Prince George, is on track to deliver 1.4 EH/s mining capacity in Q3 2022, with expansion to 2.4 EH/s expected in 2023.  “Iris Energy is on track to be one of the largest listed bitcoin miners with 15 EH/s of hardware secured (~10 EH/s expected to be operational by early 2023) and 765MW of grid-connected power operating or under construction,” said founder and co-CEO Daniel Roberts.

42396050,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0dcj,1644443956,"Zynga Plans First NFT Games, Web 3 Acquisitions in 2022","After announcing its blockchain gaming push late last year by partnering with blockchain infrastructure company Forte, mobile gaming giant Zynga is building out its team and readying the launch of its first non-fungible token (NFT) games.  The growth will also include more alliances, partnerships and potential acquisitions that will be announced before the end of this year’s second quarter, Matt Wolf, Zynga vice president of blockchain gaming, told CoinDesk in an interview.  “We’re fully tuned up to do acquisitions on the [Web 3] game publisher side,” said Wolf, who took over the blockchain gaming reins at Zynga in November, without specifying potential acquisition targets. “We’ve got a long history of growth through acquisition.”  Zynga initially gained name recognition through popular Facebook-based social games like Farmville. The move into blockchain gaming offers “future proofing” for the company, said Wolf. However, Zynga wants to make sure it’s fully prepared while making the leap.  “We know that in order for us to go fast, and be responsible to our company and our consumers and employees, we need to surround ourselves with capability, which we can get very quickly through alliances and partnerships,” said Wolf.  “We have to be really careful and actively listen and deeply understand who the cohort is that are consuming these blockchain games right now, who are collecting these NFTs,” Wolf continued.  Using Zynga’s IP  Wolf said it “makes sense” for Zynga to build original blockchain games from the ground up rather than update an existing title like Farmville. But some gameplay in the NFT titles will be inspired by Zynga intellectual property. “Probably not Farmville right away, more along the lines of Mafia Wars,” said Wolf, referring to Zynga’s once-popular social network game where players assume the roles of gangsters and build a crime organization.  “But to be inspired by that title, then build something that’s bespoke and purpose-built to this particular cohort that’s used to playing in a certain way, that’s our short-term strategy,” said Wolf.  'We're humble about this'  Zynga plans to expand the blockchain gaming team from the current 15 people to as many as 100, including filling out senior roles such as creative director and lead producer.  “We are taking our community building seriously. We are ramping up that team deeply. When we ignite the community, we will be actively engaged with that community, myself included,” said Wolf.  “We’re humble about this,” added Wolf. “Yes, we’re a very successful mobile games publisher. But we don’t have any experience building Web 3 games. We’re getting it. We’re not learning until we’re publishing in that market.”  The blockchain push isn’t the only big potential transition for Zynga. Last month, video game giant Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) announced plans to acquire Zynga for $12.7 billion, but the deal has yet to close.  Game publishers entering the crypto space have met with mixed reactions from gamers so far.

Stocks were also higher, partly due to the decline in Treasury bond yields.  BTC spot trading volume is starting to tick higher, albeit below January highs, according to CoinDesk data. Some analysts prefer to see a sustained rise in trading volume to confirm the recent bounce in crypto prices.  ""Prior cycle majors (ETC, XRP, LTC and EOS) and meme coins (DOGE, SHIB) have been significant gainers in the last 24 hours, potentially signaling the market's risk-on appetite,"" FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote in a Wednesday briefing.  Still, futures market data continues to suggest a neutral/bearish bias among traders. That means ""markets could remain indecisive about the next momentum-driven move, at least for the short term,"" FundStrat wrote.  Technical indicators have improved over the past few days, suggesting a strong buying zone between $40,000 and $46,000. Over the long term, however, buying activity could wane until momentum signals turn positive.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $44739, +1.07%    ●Ether (ETH): $3258, +4.37%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4587, +1.45%    ●Gold: $1834 per troy ounce, +0.38%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.93%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

In other news, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing to offer a cryptocurrency trading service to its investor clients, sources say. Clients could include public pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds that currently trade traditional assets through BlackRock's integrated investment management platform.  BlackRock's potential crypto plans could signal rising demand for digital asset trading among large investors.  But regulatory issues remain, which could stall the pace of institutional crypto adoption. On Tuesday, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Rostin Behnam asked the U.S. Congress to provide his agency with an additional $100 million so it can properly oversee crypto markets.  Keep an eye on trading activity  The chart below shows a gradual decrease in the total volume of buy orders filled by takers in BTC perpetual swaps, a type of derivative product in the crypto market, similar to traditional futures.  High values in buy volume indicate short-term buying pressure and high investor attention, according to CryptoQuant, a crypto data firm. Buying volume ticked lower over the past 24 hours and has not kept up with the recent bounce in BTC's spot price, which could indicate caution among derivative traders.  Still, other indicators such as open interest and buy volume versus sell volume have improved over the past week, which typically signals bullish sentiment in the crypto market.  ""Limited liquidity may have contributed to the rising bitcoin price as outsized buying orders in thin order books tend to push up prices,"" Arcane Research wrote in a report this week. Therefore, even if trading volumes rise, there needs to be enough buying power to sustain BTC's price recovery.

42394300,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQY1,1644436587,4 Unanswered Questions About the Bitfinex Hack,"Yesterday we got stunning news of the arrest of a New York couple, Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and Heather R. Morgan, for their alleged role in attempting to launder bitcoin now worth a staggering $4.6 billion. That bitcoin was stolen from the global exchange Bitfinex in August 2016, and in the half-decade since then, there has been little additional insight into the attack.  That long silence (along with what we’ll call some more lyrical factors) drove intense fascination with yesterday’s news. But as much as we learned, there’s still a great deal we don’t know, including dangling questions that could lead down a much deeper rabbit hole. Some of the most important unknowns involve the hack itself, the business fallout of the hack and the alleged launderers’ own puzzling behavior during the period they’re accused of trying to wash the stolen BTC.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  As you might expect, grappling with unanswered questions involves some speculation. I’ve done my best to highlight where that speculation appears, but we’re off the map here in general, so take what follows largely as a series of hypotheticals and thought experiments.  How did the initial hack happen?  A crucial but easily overlooked element of yesterday’s charges is that they don't allege that Lichtenstein and Morgan were responsible for the initial hack of Bitfinex. The charges don’t offer any specific theory about how they came into possession of the private keys controlling the coins. One possibility is that the couple purchased the BTC from the initial hacker(s) at a discount. Another is that they were merely acting as agents for the hacker(s), though that’s less likely given their direct control of the keys.  There is, however, some circumstantial reason to believe that the couple could have been involved in the hack itself and the Department of Justice just didn’t have quite enough evidence to charge them with more than money laundering.  The most intriguing (though again entirely circumstantial) evidence is that Morgan appears to have been outright obsessed with “social engineering,” a type of hacking that focuses on compromising people instead of code. In one lengthy presentation given at the event series NYC Salon, she described methods of deception and intimidation that she had used in real-world exercises to influence individuals and gain access to spaces and organizations.  That is particularly intriguing given the nature of the original hack, which involved compromising multisignature protections that went through security provider BitGo. In CoinDesk’s reporting at the time, Michael McSweeney wrote that “in order to withdraw such a large amount of funds, BitGo would likely have had to sign off on those transactions,” because of a multisignature security layer implemented for Bitfinex users. That raises the possibility that social engineering was involved in the hack.  It has been noted that Morgan interviewed Matt Parrella, a former chief compliance officer at BitGo, for a 2020 Forbes column titled, amazingly, “Experts share tips on how to protect your business from cybercriminals.” That’s a serious eyebrow-raiser, but it may not mean much given that Parrella was only briefly employed at BitGo in 2019 and 2020.  Why would crypto-literate criminals store private keys in the cloud?  One of the really bizarre things revealed in yesterday’s charging documents is that authorities claim they were able to seize the stolen BTC after accessing private keys that Lichtenstein/Morgan had stored in a cloud service. Keeping private keys offline at all times is one of the most fundamental security tenets of crypto management, and it’s implausible that someone undertaking to launder crypto on such a huge scale wouldn’t be well aware of that.  There are a few non-conspiratorial ways to understand the keys being stored online. Most importantly, the keys were themselves encrypted, which you can at least imagine someone rationalizing as secure.  Crypto researcher Eric Wall further suggested that despite claims in the charging documents, the keys may not have been decrypted by law enforcement. Instead, the keys may have been handed over by the culprits when confronted. That could also explain why a large portion of the stolen coins was moved on Feb. 1. Perhaps the accused launderers were demonstrating that the keys worked before handing their booty over to the feds.  It’s also worth remembering that the BTC in question was worth about $70 million at the time of the hack. It ballooned to multiple billions over the course of five years, possibly outpacing the culprits’ ability to upgrade their security practices.  Why were these secret billionaires so extremely online?  Unfortunately, we have to talk about Razzlekhan, Morgan’s strange and cringey rap persona. Morgan flooded TikTok and YouTube with weird influence-bait, including a lot of rapping, while also writing business and tech content for Forbes’ perennially sketchy contributor network. Lichtenstein published at least one Medium post about crypto and posted about crypto on Twitter. This content – some of which was set to private after the arrests – is just one thread of an extensive web presence by Morgan and, to a much lesser extent, Lichtenstein.  The question is simply – why? Most of that activity took place after the pair were in control of a bitcoin fortune. Why would you be clout-chasing online if you had that much money? (Morgan was likely making less than $100 for each Forbes contribution.)  In the end, we can only speculate. But the answer likely involves very personal impulses, particularly the desire for recognition and respect. It seems clear Morgan and Lichtenstein wanted to be seen as serious (if creative and weird) businesspeople.  For instance, the two represented themselves as partners at Demandpath, a putative investment fund focused on “distributed systems, cloud platforms and data-driven AI (artificial intelligence).” I haven’t yet unearthed information about their investments, and so the whole thing may have been a bit of a LARP – as “angel investing” often is in crypto. Morgan also represented herself as CEO of an email marketing company called Salesfolk.  What’s most incredible is that Morgan didn’t stop posting even when the walls were closing in. In court on Tuesday, the defense counsel reportedly said the defendants had known they were under investigation since November. But on Feb. 2, just one week before her arrest, Morgan posted about a business-to-business sales article she was working on for the magazine Inc. Perhaps knowledge of the investigation nudged Morgan to double down on a business that could actually make money, because monitoring rendered their BTC exceedingly dangerous to move.  It is worth noting that Morgan’s online presence appears to be distorting perceptions of the case. Her rapping and interest in social engineering make her an intriguing suspect. But in a pretrial hearing yesterday, a New York judge set bail for Ilya Lichtenstein at $5 million, but bail for Morgan at only $3 million, which may suggest the court believes Lichtenstein bears more responsibility and faces tougher consequences than Morgan does.  How does this connect back to Bitfinex?  The original Bitfinex hack occurred in early August 2016. Here’s CoinDesk’s contemporaneous report on the events. The hack, and especially Bitfinex’s efforts to recover from it, have spawned a raft of conspiracy theories and speculation often involving suspicions of possible malfeasance by Bitfinex and its associates.  After the hack, Bitfinex made a radical move, imposing the losses on its users in the form of a roughly 36% “haircut” on balances. Those who got the haircut were in return given “Recovery Rights Tokens” with the ticker BFX. These tokens were fully repaid and redeemed by April 4, 2017. The official narrative was that Bitfinex increased trading volume at the time and quickly earned back the money it had lost in the hack.  See also: A Bridge Called Tether | Opinion  But the BFX token was denominated and paid back in USD, not BTC. Bitcoin roughly doubled in price between the hack and the repayment, and so all things being equal, Bitfinex users lost money even after their BFX tokens were redeemed.  But that’s not all: As commentators pointed out at the time, the BFX token helped reduce Bitfinex’s liabilities even further. Some holders, lacking confidence in Bitfinex’s ability to repay, dumped the token on the market for as little as 49 cents on the dollar – and the exchange acknowledged buying back tokens at market value, meaning it got an even further discount against the liability of the stolen BTC.  That, combined with the fact that the hack involved compromising multisignature security, has spawned considerable speculation that the hack may have been an “inside job.” Watchdogs like Bitfinex’d have speculated that the hack was connected to the later discovery of shortfalls at Bitfinex sister operation Tether, and that the haircut and BFX token may have helped paper over other problems at the exchange. I have yet to see any airtight evidence of this, but Morgan and Lichtenstein’s trial might offer new revelations about those strange maneuvers.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT,David Z.

The metric uses a numeric scale that goes from zero to hundred for representing this sentiment. All values below fifty fall into the &apos;fear category,&apos; while those above belong to &apos;greed.&apos; When the index shows extreme values of above 75 and below 25, the market sentiment is that of extreme greed and extreme fear, respectively.

Bitcoin maximalists believe that in the future, the Bitcoin network will supply investors with everything they want in a digital currency. In this approach, maximalists are unabashedly in favor of a Bitcoin monopoly at some point in the future. The maximalists are a vociferous group of Bitcoin supporters who believe that Bitcoin should be prioritized over all other digital currencies. And that is not going well for a long period. Shutting down everything just to support one ideology is also shutting down improvements of any kind in the future. While many have taken advantage of Bitcoin&apos;s success rather than creating their own distinct brand and offering value, emulation is occasionally done in the hopes of perpetuating a concept or movement rather than with the malicious purpose of stealing credit (and market share) from the original.

At present, crypto spot markets are largely regulated at the state level. The CFTC oversees derivatives markets such as bitcoin and ether futures, and the Securities and Exchange Commission oversees tokens believed to be securities, as well as stocks and funds.  ""We are past the stage where digital assets and decentralized financial technologies are a research project, sandboxing what may come in the future. The issues are at the front and center of our thinking at the Commission in addition to our traditional regulatory, oversight and enforcement responsibilities,"" Behnam said in introductory remarks. ""The CFTC is well situated to play an increasingly central role in overseeing the cash digital asset commodity market.""  Read more: CFTC Commissioner Says US Regulators Should Issue Clear Guidance Before Punishing Crypto Firms: Report  The regulator requested that Congress, in addition to granting the CFTC additional authority, also fund the agency with an extra $100 million to properly oversee crypto markets. The agency's current annual budget is roughly $300 million.  The added funds would go toward building up internal expertise as well as better enforcing the law, Behnam said. During the hearing he said a large part of enforcement actions come from tips and whistleblowers at present, as one example.  Behnam said the agency does not currently have all of the expertise it needs to properly oversee crypto. In response to a question from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Behnam said his team does not currently have sufficient resources or knowledge to monitor and protect against cyberattacks in the digital asset sector.  However, in a follow-up response to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), he said he would be willing to build up his team.  Defining jurisdiction  One of the key issues Congress would have to address is just where the CFTC's jurisdiction ends and where the SEC's begins. Behnam acknowledged this during a discussion with Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), saying it is important to draw ""clear, distinct lines"" between which crypto assets are securities and which are not.  ""The most noticeable gap is what constitutes a security and what constitutes a commodity,"" he said, adding that ""at its core, we are a market regulator ... we would build up expertise in places we need it.""  The Dodd-Frank Act reform of traditional markets in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis is a ""perfect example"" of the type of work the CFTC could engage in for the crypto markets, he said. The Dodd-Frank Act helped reform derivatives markets (among others) over the past decade.  In addition to his remarks, Behnam also filed a response from the CFTC to a series of questions previously published by the Senate Agriculture Committee, reiterating the same arguments about how the crypto market should be regulated at the federal level.  ""In my opinion, there are important principles missing from the current regulatory framework applicable to digital asset markets that we see in other federally regulated markets, particularly ones that primarily cater to retail investors,"" Behnam wrote in the document. ""A federal regulatory regime may ensure that certain safeguards are in place to address the risks to individual investors, market integrity and systemic stability. Those safeguards could include pre-trade and post-trade transparency and uniform standards around settlement, data reporting, cyber security and leverage.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/09/cftc-should-oversee-crypto-spot-markets-chief-reiterates-before-congress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f319b5934f59784bc80596e34a340dbcfb0f00a3-5000x3333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The New York-based company, which manages over $10 trillion in assets for institutions, plans to enter the cryptocurrency space with “client support trading and then with their own credit facility,” one of the people said. In other words, clients would be able to borrow from BlackRock by pledging crypto assets as collateral.  One of the people said BlackRock will allow its clients – which include public pension schemes, endowments and sovereign wealth funds – to trade cryptocurrency through Aladdin (short for “Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network”), the asset manager’s integrated investment management platform. The timetable for unveiling the service is unclear.  BlackRock declined to comment.  The asset manager may have been telegraphing its intentions as early as June when it began hiring for an Aladdin blockchain strategy lead.

The thrust of that deal centers on exclusive seating naming rights. For the next five years, the ballpark’s home plate VIP lounge will be called “The Terra Club” and feature crypto branding prominently.  “The Nationals continue to push the envelope,” Mark D. Lerner, managing principal owner of the Washington Nationals, said in a blog post. “We are excited to partner with Terra to name our most exclusive club and explore bringing powerful new fan experiences to Nationals Park, including the use of UST cryptocurrency to make purchases.”  CoinDesk preempted the official announcement with a cheeky investigative essay published Tuesday that correctly predicted the tie-up.  Read more: Terra Wants to Spend $40M on a Mystery Sports Deal. We Think It’s With This MLB Team  Accepting UST payments would place the Nationals in a small but growing field of crypto-friendly sports stadiums. Mark Cuban’s Dallas Mavericks basketball team began taking DOGE last year. Meanwhile, fellow National Basketball Association franchise the Sacramento Kings tapped bitcoin back in 2014.  The Nationals sponsorship is also notable because of its crossover with crypto governance. The Terra decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) overwhelmingly voted in favor of partnering with a mystery U.S. sports franchise to the tune of nearly $40 million. Holders of the network's native LUNA token went into the vote, which concluded Tuesday, knowing nearly every aspect of the sponsorship – save the name of their prospective partner.  “This first-of-its-kind partnership between a DAO and a sports franchise opens a new world of opportunities for bringing crypto and DeFi to the masses,” Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, said in a statement. “By approving this sponsorship deal, the community has a new way to engage and educate the public, including the policy makers doing important work in Washington, D.C., about decentralized money and the burgeoning technology that underlies it.”  Kwon and Terraform Labs are both currently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on possible charges that the Mirror Protocol, developed by Terraform, allows synthetic stocks to trade in violation of U.S. law.  The SEC served Kwon a subpoena last year during a cryptocurrency conference, though he denied he had been served until he decided to file a lawsuit against the SEC alleging the regulator violated norms in serving him the subpoena.

Launching on Raydium – a leading Solana-based automated market maker (AMM) – SOLI will provide investors broad exposure to the native applications built on Solana including Raydium and Serum, supplying 32.45% and 28.97% weightage, respectively.  Solana’s native token SOL will account for 33% of SOLI. However, rather than using SOL, the SOLI token will use Marinade Finance’s liquid staking mSOL token. mSOL is a staked version of SOL, which offers 6% annual percentage yield (APY) in the form of Solana staking rewards, meaning SOLI would offer profits from both yield and asset growth.  The remaining allocation comprises of Solend, an algorithmic, decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing (2.15%); and Tulip Protocol, a yield aggregation platform (3.43%).  Amun said in a prepared statement that the SOLI composition was made based on average market capitalization and decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity.  SOLI will be rebalanced monthly to lock in gains and ensure constituent tokens are allocated accordingly by market capitalization rank and liquidity. The index management fee is 1.5% annually, which will be waived for all token holders until the end of 2022.  SOLI can be minted, burned and redeemed for an underlying basket of tokens in one click on the Amun Platform, according to the company.  Solana is intended to offer a faster, more expandable alternative to Ethereum and other layer 1 blockchains.

Other participants in the round include Twitter, venture capital investor Tim Draper and Avon Ventures, a venture capital fund affiliated with Fidelity Investments.  Founded in 2018, Los Angeles-based OpenNode processes and settles bitcoin payments instantly through the Lightning Network, the leading system for improving bitcoin’s scalability.  OpenNode said its systems for businesses and platforms include payment buttons, hosted checkouts, e-commerce plug-ins and optimized application programming interfaces (APIs).  ""OpenNode allows the retailer to accept bitcoin without having to pay the banks or the credit card companies the 2% to 4%. OpenNode can do it with only a fraction of the energy cost required for an on-chain bitcoin transaction,"" said Tim Draper in the press release.

OpenNode is creating easier pathways for anyone, anywhere to access the digital economy through their seamless integration of bitcoin payments,"" said Twitter group product manager Esther Crawford.  Twitter is OpenNode’s newest backer, reflecting the social network’s growing moves into crypto. In November, Twitter launched a dedicated crypto team.

42423760,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2g9Jh,1644423163,IMF Chief Touts Advantages of CBDCs Over ‘Unbacked Crypto Assets’ and Stablecoins,"Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Wednesday that private cryptocurrencies and stablecoins may not be as practical as well-designed central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).  In her speech delivered at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, an American think tank, Georgieva argued that CBDCs could “potentially offer more resilience, more safety, greater availability and lower costs” than stablecoins and “unbacked crypto assets that are inherently volatile.”  As Georgieva pointed out, there has been a global explosion of interest in CBDCs, with nearly 100 countries currently exploring CBDCs at either a research, testing or distribution phase. Georgieva said that the IMF has been “deeply involved” in CBDC research, and has provided “technical assistance” to many member countries as they pursue the development of their own CBDCs.  Through the IMF’s involvement in CBDC development around the world, Georgieva said the organization has learned three lessons.  First, CBDCs aren’t a one-size-fits-all technology. Georgieva told attendees that because each economy is different, CBDCs will play a different role in every country. In nations that are less economically developed, Georgieva suggested that CBDCs could help with financial inclusion, and in others, they could act as a backup payment method.  Second, Georgieva told attendees that the IMF sees both privacy and financial stability as “paramount” to the design of CBDCs. She touted the benefits of CBDCs that are not interest bearing in order to prevent a decline in use of traditional banks, as well as the utility of placing limits on holdings of CBDCs to “prevent sudden outflows of bank deposits into CBDC.”  “In many countries, privacy concerns are a potential deal breaker when it comes to CBDC legislation and adoption,” Georgieva added. “So it’s vital that policymakers get the mix right.”  Privacy concerns around China’s digital yuan – which Georgieva spotlighted in her speech as being one of the six central banks at the “frontier” of CBDC development – did not factor into her speech.  Finally, Georgieva concluded by urging central banks to find “balance” between the design and policy of CBDCs, to consider public-private partnerships to work on features of the CBDCs and to keep financial stability in mind.

42394555,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBjmN,1644422745,NFTs in the Metaverse: How to Earn Money With Unique Assets,"First coined in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 science fiction novel “Snow Crash,” the metaverse is more or less defined as a virtual world (or worlds), reminiscent of games and films like ""Ready Player One,"" Roblox and Fortnite. Inside this space, people can live vicariously through their avatars by trading and maintaining digital assets that center around a fully functioning real-world economy.  But while some details of the metaverse market are still fairly abstract, other components like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as something of a foundation for its internal infrastructure and economy. People are using NFTs within the metaverse to purchase virtual land plots, event passes, avatars and other digital items.  NFTs and real estate investing in the metaverse  Virtual landowners  As mentioned, one way people are using NFTs in the metaverse is to buy virtual land, such as LAND – a digital piece of real estate in The Sandbox. These virtual spaces use NFTs, as opposed to a physical deed, to reflect ownership of specific locations within a virtual world.  In the Sandbox, LAND comprises about 300 square feet in the game world. In Decentraland, the size changes to 50-square-foott land parcels.  If users hold enough plots of land, they can combine them to create a single estate. One example of that is “The Secrets of Satoshi’s Tea Garden” – an estate on Decentraland made up of 64 separate plots of land. It sold for 1.3 million MANA in 2019 (about $80,000) because of its size and location. The ""land"" is completely surrounded by digital roads, making it convenient to access.  In 2021, the Metaverse Group bought an estate in Decentraland for 618,000 MANA, which was equivalent to about $3.2 million at the time. Just as in the real world, location is everything in digital real estate, and plots that are close to entry points or to places such as virtual arenas that promise virtual foot traffic tend to increase in value.  Renting and lending  Depending on market demand, people can rent their NFTs to earn passive income. Landowners in the metaverse can do that through PARSIQ’s IQ Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that provides ways for game developers to make money.  Similar to the dynamics of traditional property and real estate, the IQ Protocol helps virtual landowners earn yield and rent fees through predetermined conditions that are negotiated with renters and enforced by smart contracts.  Residual dividends  Along with royalties that creators can earn when NFTs are sold or resold on secondary markets, NFTs can also help investors earn passive dividends. One example of this is a segment of a digital Monaco racing track in the F1 Delta Time game that was auctioned for $222,000 in December 2020.  The NFT representing the digital track allows the owner to receive 5% dividends from all races that take place on it, including entry ticket fees for races and yields from “Elite Events” that require participants to stake REVV for entry.  NFTs and gaming in the metaverse  Play-to-earn, in-game assets and rewards  Through games like Axie Infinity and Aavegotchi, the play-to-earn (P2E) model has created entirely new virtual economies that reward users with assets like NFTs and in-game cryptocurrencies that can be swapped, sold or borrowed. In addition, other games like Battle Racer help further utility by releasing car parts as separate NFTs. Users can then buy these parts to build their vehicles or sell them separately on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea.  Although it is still years away, the ways people are using NFTs in these blockchain networks can also be applied to skins and cosmetics in more mainstream games like Fortnite. Not only would that help players better reflect the ownership and originality of their assets, but it would increase global in-game spending, which is projected to surpass $74.4 billion by 2025.  Epic Games, the software developer and owner of Fortnite, welcomes any game that supports NFTs to its store, but it won’t directly release or engage with NFTs because of what is perceives as scams in the market.

For instance, one example of how avatars are evolving in the metaverse can be seen in the partnership between Gutter Cat Gang, a collection of NFTs, with House of Kibaa, an emerging virtual reality studio. Together, House of Kibaa is creating animated 3D avatars available for all Gutter species, with the community eligible to exclusive raffles for free upgrades, including weapons, wearables, vehicles, pets and real estate like trap houses and mansions within the House of Kibaa metaverse.  Private events and parties  Meanwhile, NFT passes can be used to generate revenue for virtual events, parties and concerts hosted in different metaverses. In September 2021, Snoop Dog, an avid NFT proponent, rapper and entrepreneur, partnered with The Sandbox to host a private party. As announced on The Sandbox, to attend the event, 1,000 NFT party passes were made available, with 650 released on The Sandbox’s marketplace. In essence, The Snoop Private Party Pass gave people access to Snoop Dogg’s private lifestyle, exclusive NFTs, experiences, and a chance to have Snoop Dogg perform an exclusive concert on their LAND.  Snoop Dog is among a long list of brands and influencers that have worked with The Sandbox for NFT-centric events and releases. Some of those brands include The Walking Dead, Atari and Warner Music Group.  Level up: advanced NFT investing in the metaverse  Total spending on NFTs was reported to be more than $12.6 billion by the end of 2021, and some of the ways that buyers are earning passive yields (residual income) and maximizing the potential of their investments include:  Yield-generating NFTs: Timing markets in Web 3 can be next to impossible, even for the most seasoned investor, and so to create more practical incentives and mitigate against the volatility of the NFT sector, a number of projects generate passive returns by issuing governance tokens to holders. Notable among these collections include the Genesis Cyber Kongz, which is set to produce 10 $BANANA tokens every day for the next 10 years. Other examples are SupDucks (($VOLT) and Mutant Cats ($FISH). While the use case is still unclear, Bored Ape Yacht Club was also expected to launch its own token in the first quarter of 2022.  Staking: Together with collecting NFTs that generate passive yields, investors can also reap the combined benefits of NFTs and DeFi protocols by staking, or locking up their assets in a smart contract to receive rewards. Considering the strict regulations around securities, most of these rewards are in the form of tokens specific to the project, and used for standard features like governance or voting rights. That said, if the tokens are listed on decentralized exchanges like SushiSwap or Uniswap, stakers can sell them in the market.  Nested NFTs: In the past, NFTs were fairly static. For the most part, what somebody minted or bought in a secondary market couldn’t be changed. With platforms like Charged Particles, however, people can now layer NFTs onto other NFTs and transform one NFT into a virtual basket that can hold multiple ERC-based tokens. This new type of nested NFT helps add intrinsic value to a collectible and turn what would be a speculative investment into something like a yield-generating asset – with a scarce NFT attached to another scarce NFT, ad infinitum.  Overall, nested NFTs help provide value for users in the metaverse by customizing and adding new functionality to virtual items. Ben Lakoff, co-founder and business lead of Charged Particles, highlighted in a webinar some use cases. They include weapon that gains power as the contained NFTs accrue interest and a painting that can shift depending on the amount of tokens deposited in it.

42394568,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBkr3,1644422727,"OpenSea Marketplace: How to Buy, Sell and Mint NFTs","If you’ve ever attempted to explore the non-fungible token (NFT) world, odds are you’ve heard of OpenSea. The platform is probably the most prominent gateway to the NFT market, and you may be considering it as the marketplace you’ll use to explore and start interacting with the space.  Before you get started, it’s important to have a basic understanding of how it works. Here, you will find everything you need to know about OpenSea, including how to create, buy and sell NFTs.  But first, let us brush up on some of the basics of NFTs and why you will need a marketplace like OpenSea to access them.  What are NFTs?  Since bitcoin launched in 2009, people are becoming more accustomed to buying and owning assets that exist only in the digital world. With blockchain as the underlying technology, cryptocurrency enables a way to own and transfer value on the internet without necessarily involving a third party. Interestingly, NFTs build on this functionality to create new possibilities centered around the uniqueness of digital assets.  Whereas crypto assets like bitcoin and ether are fungible, or exchangeable, NFTs, thanks to blockchain technology, enable digital assets that are verifiably unique and unexchangeable. In other words, NFTs provide the much-needed non-fungibility for bringing unique digital assets and real-world assets to the blockchain.  An NFT can represent digital art, an in-game asset, music or any other item that requires a system for authenticating its uniqueness, rareness and ownership status in the digital realm.  The ownership of an NFT can be transferred in exchange for digital currencies without involving third parties. However, for this to happen, interested buyers and sellers must perform this task on a platform specially designed to allow the listing, buying and selling of NFTs. These platforms are called NFT marketplaces.  What is OpenSea?  OpenSea is an NFT marketplace that keyed into the NFT movement early enough to establish itself as not only the preferred choice for NFT traders but also the favored destination for NFT developers. Apart from its first-mover advantage, OpenSea’s successes can also be traced to its open-world design that allows anyone to create NFTs for free, as well as buy and sell them on a verifiable infrastructure powered by blockchain technology. This open-world design has attracted NFT creators in droves, as there are little or no restrictions in place to stifle the creative and transactional processes involved.  While this is viewed by some as a vital aspect of OpenSea's operations, the lack of restrictions has been identified as a ticking time bomb, so much so that OpenSea briefly restricted the number of NFTs each user can mint, only for the team to reverse its decision after receiving backlash from the community for the move.  Regardless of the controversies surrounding OpenSea’s operations, it remains the largest NFT marketplace, with over $3.5 billion worth of Ethereum-based NFT trades processed in August 2021 alone. To put this stat into perspective, OpenSea posted just $20 million worth of NFT trading volume for the entirety of 2020.  What are the features of OpenSea?  Here are the things to look out for when using OpenSea.  As stated earlier, one of the core strengths of OpenSea is that it runs a decentralized marketplace where all trades and activities are recorded in real time on the blockchain.  In addition to this, it has expanded its operations across three blockchain infrastructures, including Ethereum, Polygon and Klatyn. In other words, you can purchase NFTs based on any of these chains on OpenSea.  It is also worth mentioning that OpenSea has enabled easy-to-understand processes for all of its main features, including minting, buying and selling NFTs. In essence, you do not need coding experience to use the platform.  Lastly, it offers a gasless, or feeless, means of creating NFTs, thanks to Polygon integrations. For those unfamiliar with Polygon, it is a blockchain that makes it cheaper to transact with Ethereum tokens and interact with Ethereum-based applications.  How to create NFTs on OpenSea  As a new user, you will need to register an account before you can start to interact with NFTs on OpenSea. To do this, you need to set up a wallet, preferably the MetaMask extension on Google Chrome. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up a MetaMask wallet.  Once you have your wallet ready, continue with the following steps to set up an account on OpenSea.  On the homepage of OpenSea, click the wallet icon at the right corner of the website to connect your newly created wallet. You will see a prompt requesting that you choose your preferred wallet. Pick the wallet of your choice (which, in this case, will be MetaMask) and complete the connection process from your wallet.  After setting up your wallet, you will be navigated to your default profile page on OpenSea. Since this account is in the default state, you need to personalize your account. Before this, OpenSea will prompt you to sign an agreement to continue. Once you scale this stage, you can customize your account by entering a username, writing a bio and adding a profile picture.

One thing you should have at the back of your mind, however, is that depending on the blockchain you intend to create NFTs on, you may need to have enough coins in your wallet to cover the applicable transaction fees. If you have that covered, you can start minting with the following steps.  From your account page, if you’re only looking to create single NFTs, click on “Create” and enter a name, description URL link and anything else you want to include. Scroll to the bottom and click the lower “Create” to mint it on the blockchain.  To create a collection, you’ll need to click on your account icon, then “My collections.” Under the “Create new collection” option, click on ""Create"" to set a collection name, enter a description and upload an image. You can play around with the various editing tools on this page to give your collection a really unique feel.  To mint an NFT under the collection you just created, click ""Add New Item."" You will be navigated to a page where you can enter the name of the NFT and upload metadata, such as an image, video or audio file. You can also add properties, like the year the NFT was created, to help potential buyers filter NFTs in your collection.  One last thing to note: You can add unlockable items that are only accessible to the owner of the NFT. For example, you can include a way to redeem real-world assets linked to the NFT in question, such as a physical representation of the piece or admission to an event.  Once you are satisfied with all you have done so far, click on ""Create"" and sign the message on your connected wallet. If you have chosen to launch your NFT on Polygon, you do not need to pay a transaction fee to complete this NFT minting process. In contrast, minting on Ethereum will incur a network fee.  How to sell NFTs on OpenSea  After creating your NFT, you can list it on OpenSea for sale. You can follow the steps below to do just that.  From your account page, select your profile image at the top right corner to reveal the Profile option. Click “Profile” to be navigated to your wallet, where you can select the NFT you wish to sell.  Once you have selected the NFT and navigated to the NFTs description page, click on ""Sell"" at the top right corner of the screen to move to the listing page.  On the listing page, you can choose to either set a fixed price for the item or opt for a timed auction, which requires interested buyers to outbid themselves to acquire the item. Furthermore, you can set a duration for the sales or reserve the NFT for a specific buyer.  At the bottom of this page, you will find all the fees associated with this sale. Note that OpenSea will charge a 2.5% service fee on all sales and a 10% royalty fee payable to the original creator of the NFT.  After reviewing the details of this sale, you will be requested to sign a transaction on your wallet to confirm the sale. Since this is your first time selling an item on OpenSea, you need to initialize your wallet to continue. Also, if you had imported the NFT from an external marketplace or you did not mint it on Opensea, you will need to undergo an extra confirmation process to permit OpenSea to sell the NFT on your behalf.  Read more: NFT Scams: How to Avoid Falling Victim  How to buy NFTs on OpenSea  When buying NFTs on OpenSea, you can either purchase items with fixed prices or make an offer. You can follow these steps to buy NFTs at fixed prices.  Explore the listed NFTs to find an NFT you would like to purchase. Once you have found one, ensure that you review the details, including its price history, of the NFT thoroughly to confirm that the NFT in question is worth buying. Be sure to check for red flags of common NFT scams.  After verifying that the NFT is the real deal, click on ""Buy Now"" to further review the purchase before you are navigated to a checkout pop-up window, where you can find the final cost of your purchase.  If all seems fine, press the ""Checkout"" button to complete the transaction. By doing so, OpenSea will direct you to your wallet where you will find the applicable gas fee. Click on ""Confirm"" to finalize the purchase. After completing the transaction, you can view the NFT in your wallet by going back to your profile page and clicking ""In-Wallet.""  Now that you are familiar with the process of buying NFTs with fixed prices, the following steps illustrate how to purchase items on auction.  Find an NFT on auction that you would like to buy and click the ""Make Offer"" button after you have reviewed the details of the auction and the bidding prices of other interested buyers. Note that a new bid must be at least 5% higher than the current bid price of the NFT before it can be accepted.  Again, you may be asked to review the NFT to ensure that it is not a counterfeit.  Next, select the digital currency you would prefer to make the offer in. If you opt for a currency you have not used to make a purchase before on OpenSea, you may be asked to pay a one-time fee.  Select a bidding price and also an expiration date for your offer. Once this is done, all you need to do is wait for the seller to decide on the best price to sell the NFT. In a case where the item happens to be a highly sought-after NFT, you might need to keep upping your offer to stay in the thick of things.

Such news doesn&apos;t come as a surprise anymore. As the total value of the world&apos;s 12,333 digital currencies approaches $1.8 trillion, the stablecoin economy has recently grown to $179 billion, or nearly 10% of the total crypto economy. This record has been much quicker to attain compared to last year, where it took around two months to see the transfer volume surpass $150 billion. In 2020, it took nine months to surpass this milestone. As for 2019, it lasted an entire year. What Are Stablecoins? The volatility of tokens has always been one of the major challenges to cryptocurrency investing. Bitcoin, for example, can drastically change in value by the minute. Stablecoins are established to tackle that problem surrounding blockchains; it aims to keep track and match the value of the fiat currency US dollars (USD). Tether (USDT), the first established stablecoin and still the most successful to this day, was merely introduced as a digital token with &apos;a stable price.&apos; This works as the Tether Foundation keeps 1 USD in reserve for every USDT issued, keeping its price stabilized around $1 since each unit of USDT could be redeemed for one of the US dollars in the reserve.

42393983,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQNRP,1644422081,5 Tips for Traveling in El Salvador Spending Only Bitcoin,"When we chose to leave Italy to travel to El Salvador using only bitcoin, never touching cash or even using a credit card, we really didn't know if it would be possible. We were prepared to fail miserably in our purpose and do it in a matter of days.  Instead, the 45 days of our mission flew by, we traveled everywhere in the country, from the most touristy areas to the most remote and isolated ones, and we managed to do it while fully enjoying the bitcoin standard, as only in the small Central American nation it is possible to do.  Laura Nori is a community manager for the Desmos Network, a blockchain for building user-centric social networks. Riccardo Giorgio Frega hosts the Bitcoin Italia Podcast.  In our travels we have met so many people who have come to El Salvador to see what is happening, and we know that many others, maybe just by reading the reports of our adventures in the mainstream magazines or on our blog, are thinking of doing so. The news of President Nayib Bukele’s bitcoin law has gone worldwide, and this is a beautiful country, rich in history, culture and with beautiful landscapes and beaches. Even though the oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency is now legal tender in El Salvador, it isn't super easy for visitors to get by on bitcoin alone. But with a few little tricks, it's possible and fun.  Here are the five things we learned after exploring it all.  Rent a car with BTC  The country is tiny, and this is a valuable feature. In just a few hours' drive, you can go from the sunny beaches of Bitcoin Beach, a surfer's paradise, to the lush mountains around Sushitoto, to bathe in the waters of its majestic lake.  Or experience the mesmerizing chaos of the capital San Salvador and, in the same day, visit the beautiful Santa Ana, with its volcanoes and coffee plantations.  There is a problem though. Public transportation in the country is spotty, poorly organized and very slow. It’s not an ideal solution (although a very charming one).  The best option is to rent a car. If the big international companies like Budget and Avis have not yet adapted to the BTC revolution, the country is full of small private rentals. Use Google to find them: They are everywhere. Many of them will be very happy to accept bitcoin, and you will find that they will do so at extremely competitive prices. A car gives you maximum freedom and all of El Salvador in the palm of your hand.  Plan ahead  By no means expect everyone in El Salvador to accept bitcoin. The law is brand new, and citizens and businesses are free to choose whether or not to offer this option to their customers. Hotels especially seem to be the most reluctant to adopt the innovation, especially in less touristy locations. It is therefore essential to call ahead and ask. Use the internet to choose hotels that interest you in your chosen location and simply call them until you find one that is willing to accept bitcoin. It is also a great way to knock the rust off your Spanish!  Try the pupusas  The same standard should be applied to restaurants. By no means expect everyone to be willing to serve you in exchange for bitcoin. Again, you will have to ask in advance. But don't be intimidated, they will all respond politely, and it will be a great way to get to know the locals.  Paradoxically, the most popular and cheapest restaurants have often proven to be the most open to innovation. Even the owner of the most shabby dive bar will most likely have a smartphone with the Chivo wallet in his pocket and rather than lose a customer will be happy to let you try to pay with it. The national dish is pupusa, which is a skillet-cooked tortilla that is delicious and cheap. Not to be missed.  Warning: If you are off the beaten path, most likely you will be the first bitcoin-only customer, so be prepared to have to teach yourself how to make a transaction. They often have no idea. It's part of the game and don't forget that we are all pioneers in this revolution!  Find any excuse to talk to locals  The best thing about traveling in El Salvador using only bitcoin is that it will force you to frequently talk to the locals. Don't be shy!  Remember that even though BTC is legal tender, the bitcoin expert is you. Tell those you meet on your trip about this technology. They have received very little education so far and talking to those who know the most about it is important to them. We have received so much gratitude from locals after sharing what this technology allows them to do and what the benefits of total financial independence can be.  Adapt to their routine  Especially in the less touristy areas, the pace of life in El Salvador is totally different from that of Europe or the United States. People here wake up early in the morning and go to bed very early at night. Don't expect great nightlife, be prepared to have dinner very early and see the streets of the cities already semi-deserted after 8 p.m. Although it is no longer unsafe to travel at night, nightlife is only possible in the more wealthy or touristy areas. Try to tune into these rhythms of life to see the truest part of El Salvador and live elbow to elbow with the locals. Plus, the sunrises and sunsets are spectacular just about everywhere. You should definitely not miss them.  There are many who ask if it is safe to travel in El Salvador today: It is. But visitors should exercise due caution and show the respect that one should always have when traveling and dealing with different cultures. We never felt in danger or found ourselves uncomfortable.  On the contrary, we got along so well that we decided to stay longer, so much so that today, more than two and a half months later, we are still in the country.

The Bank of Zambia aims to cut transaction costs and increase citizens' participation in the formal financial system, Bloomberg said.  The news follows shortly after the central bank issued a warning on the use of cryptocurrencies, saying “people who want to deal in them should have a clear understanding of all the risks that come with such payment and investment instruments,” according to Bloomberg.  This strongly echoes the rhetoric of the central bank in Zambia's neighbor to the south, Zimbabwe. ""As a central bank we don't believe in cryptocurrencies,"" Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor John Mangudya said in December. Zimbabwe is also exploring the development of a CBDC and plans to send a team to research the experience of Nigeria, where one was launched in October.  Some 100 countries are researching the possibilities of developing a CBDC, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a speech today.  The motivation is in part out of concern that they will see demand for their fiat currencies drop should citizens use CBDCs from other countries or, indeed, a private cryptocurrency. Developing nations with often unstable fiat currencies are more prone to this risk than most, hence the widespread interest in developing CBDCs.  Read more: CBDCs for the People?

They have established themselves as a major market segment in the crypto industry, with more than $20 billion in trading volume and mainstream participation from all corners of the world. NFTs have now become a market-expanding technology. So, it is no longer limited to art or any type of digital collectible. Its true ownership and non-fungible characteristics enabled multiple use-cases in the real world. Among many innovative use-cases of NFTs, the one that stands out and can immediately make a global impact is ticketing in the music industry. For years, the music industry has been stagnant, with incremental improvements that made no significant impact on artists and the music landscape as a whole. In addition, the music ticket market is fragmented. Only a few handful companies control the market by scalping and using bots to scoop up tickets at low prices and benefit from the arbitrage. This creates a multi-billion dollar secondary market where fans have to purchase at exorbitant prices and still face uncertainty whether they will be allowed to an event. To escape from this centralized system and give back control to artists, it is essential to incorporate NFT ticketing at scale.

42423768,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2g9Xh,1644420362,Crypto Advocates Push Back on Sweden’s Call for EU Mining Ban,"If recent headlines are to be taken at face value, the European Union (EU) could be on its way to banning crypto mining because of energy concerns.  The call for a ban on crypto mining across the EU’s 27 member nations is mainly coming from regulators in Sweden, who are concerned about renewable energy being used to mine cryptocurrencies like bitcoin instead of being channeled for public use. Politicians in Germany, Spain and Norway are supporting the call.  On Thursday, EU Parliament member Stefan Berger, who is responsible for the upcoming regulatory package for controlling crypto assets in the union, called a potential ban on crypto mining a death sentence for bitcoin in the EU.  Members of Europe’s crypto community believe the EU’s ongoing energy crunch, which has sent household electricity bills skyrocketing, has regulators reaching for low-hanging fruit rather than addressing the root causes of the shortage.  Proof-of-work mining, the energy-intensive process used to mint popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, has come under heavy scrutiny globally after comparisons were made between electricity use in creating bitcoin to energy consumption in some sovereign nations last year. The New York Times reported in September that the bitcoin mining industry uses more electricity annually than Finland, a nation of around 5.5 million people.  Months before that report, in May, China, which had dominated the crypto mining sector, moved to outlaw mining in the country. In the months following China’s ban, miners scattered across the globe looking for cheap electricity and a friendlier regulatory environment. By August, the U.S. had lapped up the lion’s share of the global mining market followed by Kazakhstan and Russia.  Sweden’s proposal, however, has left the European crypto community perplexed. Crypto advocates argue that, for a variety of reasons including soaring energy prices in the region, China’s ban has not led to a significant pickup in mining in the EU.  According to data from the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, Sweden’s average monthly bitcoin hashrate (the computing power used per second when mining) rose 0.84% percentage points between May and August 2021 following China’s ban. For comparison, the U.S. hashrate picked up by 17.7% percentage points. Eric Wall, a Swedish software engineer and chief investment officer at Arcane Assets, said no major mining companies have set up in Sweden, and there is no evidence that a large part of Sweden’s renewable energy production is getting sucked up by mining.  Meanwhile, August’s largest amount of hashrate in the EU (still under 5%) was recorded in Ireland and Germany, but that, too, comes with a caveat. The Cambridge research team states on the website that there is little evidence of large mining operations in either country justifying the figures. The hashrate is “likely significantly inflated” thanks to virtual private networks (VPN) and other methods used to redirect IP addresses.  Dmitrijs Litkins, founder of the European Crypto Mining Association, said he is not worried about a crypto ban in the region because there might be nothing to ban.  “It’s almost dead in Europe,” Litkins said in an email to CoinDesk.  Mining difficulty and the energy crunch  As the chaos following China’s ban settled and mining picked up again, so, too, did mining difficulty.  Mining difficulty adjusts automatically based on the amount of computational power or hashrate required to keep the time it takes to mine a block or group of transactions at around 10 minutes. The higher the hashrate, or energy provided, the higher the difficulty.  In January 2022, bitcoin mining difficulty was at an all-time high. Litkins, who is based in Latvia, says this puts EU countries that have been struggling with rising energy prices at a disadvantage when it comes to mining.  “Mining without having an electricity source of 0.03-0.04 euros per kilowatt-hour is useless for investors, and getting this price is impossible from standard electricity supply sources,” Litkins said.  Whit Gibbs, founder and CEO of bitcoin mining service provider Compass Mining, is also based in Latvia. He said his household electricity bills have skyrocketed. According to local reports, electricity prices in Latvia are almost five times higher than in December 2020.  Latvia is not the only country feeling the crunch. In December, Bloomberg reported that short-term electricity bills across EU nations reached record-breaking heights in 2021, soaring over 200% in countries including Germany and France. In the Nordic region, energy costs rose around 470% from the previous year. Sweden was no exception.  According to Gibbs, the energy crunch stems from a number of factors including Russia disrupting supplies to the EU as tensions rise with Ukraine, and the debate over commissioning nuclear energy in the region.  “This increase in the scarcity of power is, of course, driving up the costs. Because of this, a lot of mainland Europe are hyper-vigilant at how they're going to continue to power people's homes,” Gibbs said. “I think that's what's bringing this ban on proof-of-work mining into the conversation now.”  Wall says access to cheap energy is key to staying competitive in bitcoin mining.  “Otherwise, you're going to be mining bitcoins that are worth less than what you paid for it,” Wall said.  According to both Wall and Litkins, the only way it would make sense to mine bitcoin in the EU is by having access to a renewable energy source.  Litkins took it a step further.  “Crypto mining will be possible only after the investor will arrange or build his own independent cheap electricity supply,” he said, adding that the easiest and the most efficient way, for now, is to build a solar power plant.  This is the point of contention: Regulators are concerned renewable energy could be diverted to bitcoin mining.  Indra Overland, a research professor and head of the energy program at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, says that although he doesn’t think there is significant mining activity in the EU, he understands Sweden’s desire to put a stop to it.  “I am afraid I agree with the Swedish standpoint. Even if cryptocurrencies use renewable energy where it is abundant, they are competing against other users who could also be attracted to those pockets of cheap renewables,” Overland said in an email to CoinDesk.  The energy transition to renewables requires a reorganization of multiple sectors, he said. He added that this is already happening, and in the coming years many energy-intensive industries will move to locations where there is abundant clean energy.  “Clogging up those locations with cryptocurrency mining will slow down this process,” Overland said.  For example, if there is an excess of hydropower in a location, a cryptocurrency miner may set up shop in that location, Overland explained. If someone else, such as an aluminum smelter, wants to tap into that energy it will then have to offer more money for it than the crypto miner is paying to get access.  Francesco Bruschi, a professor of engineering and member of the Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Observatory at the Polytechnic University of Milan, doesn’t think mining is a significant enough threat to the consumption of renewable energy.  “Miners are looking for the cheapest energy sources, and if renewables are cheaper mining may be part of the demand,” Bruschi said in an email to CoinDesk.  Wall said there have not been any major mining companies setting up in Sweden. He also has not seen any sign that a large part of the country’s renewable energy sources is actually being diverted to mining.  Regulators’ perspective  Talk of a mining ban in the EU started in November when two Swedish regulators published an open letter calling for a halt to proof-of-work mining in the EU because of energy concerns. They called crypto assets a threat to the climate transition.  “Sweden needs the renewable energy targeted by crypto-asset producers for the climate transition of our essential services, and increased use by miners threatens our ability to meet the Paris Agreement,” the letter said, referring to the international treaty on climate change.  A few days later, a lawmaker from Norway hinted it might consider backing Sweden’s proposal. Then, in mid-January, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) also appeared to be urging an EU-wide ban on crypto mining.  The ESMA official calling for the ban was Erik Thedéen, director general at the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, Finansinspektionen (FI), who was recently appointed ESMA vice chair. Thedéen co-authored the letter from Swedish regulators in November along with Björn Risinger, director general at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.  A spokesperson for ESMA told CoinDesk that the comments made by Thedéen were in his capacity as the head of Sweden's FI. ESMA also declined to comment on the use of renewable energy for crypto mining, stating it does not have a position on the issue.  However, Swedish regulators certainly would not be the first to consider restricting mining. In September 2019, China claimed a 75% share of the global hashrate. China’s 2021 crackdown on crypto mining was at least in part due to its policy goals to phase out coal power production.  Things aren’t so rosy in the new mining hotspots either. On Jan. 24, Kazakh authorities completely cut off the energy supply to crypto miners in the country for the remainder of the month, citing the national grid’s struggles to meet household demand during winter. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are pressing mining companies to detail their electricity use, climate impact and expansion plans.  As for Sweden, the FI says it hopes to contribute to highlighting the increasing environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining worldwide.  “We are especially keen that policy-makers and politicians realize that the path of renewable [energy] is inappropriate given the global shortage of energy in general and renewable energy specifically. Proof-of-work should instead be banned in favor of more energy-efficient blockchain technologies,” Klas Malmen, innovation coordinator at the FI, said in an email to CoinDesk.  In his comments from January, Thedéen said a better option could be proof-of-stake mining, a system where owners of a particular currency stake their wealth as an incentive to uphold the network; it is expected to use far less energy. Although Ethereum is planning to migrate to proof-of-stake mining this year, it isn’t currently in use.  Meanwhile, Wall is confused as to why his country’s financial regulator is suddenly getting involved in energy decisions.  “That's not the role of the financial regulator,” Wall said.  In 2020, the FI received an assignment from the Swedish government to contribute to developing the financial sector in a sustainable way, Malmen said of the FI’s involvement.  “Given that crypto assets based on [proof-of-work] are the by far most energy-intensive activities in the financial sector, we believe it is of great importance that we act to reduce its climate impact,” Malmen said.  After the open letter in November, Wall tweeted a segment from Sweden’s state-owned national broadcaster SVT in which one of Sweden’s largest state-owned energy producers, Vattenfall, says cryptocurrency mining can be useful as a buffer to help regulate energy flow when the supply of energy fluctuates.  According to Lucia Fuselli, a renewable energy specialist, engineer and fellow at the World Energy Council, there are many ways in which energy can act as a buffer, but she mainly views a buffer as a form of storage. Excess energy produced during periods of weak demand can be utilized when there is high demand, Fuselli said.  “I'm not quite sure whether crypto mining would be kind of at the same level or could be utilized as a buffer. ... There needs to be a system agreed by a wider number of states,” Fuselli said.  For this to work in the EU’s 27 states, there needs to be a standardized system and a clear set of rules agreed by all, she added.  “I don't see that level of unity at present, at least in the EU,” Fuselli said.  Vattenfall declined to comment for this article.  A global issue  According to Gibbs, in the short term, we will see quite a bit of positioning where various regulatory bodies, member states and individuals in the EU.  “We'll see people start to put forward data on both sides of the aisle, those in favor of and those against, to back their claims as to why proof-of-work mining should or shouldn't be banned,” Gibbs said.  Wall hopes that when Sweden tries to take up its proposal with the EU, it would lead to a compilation of qualified feedback on the subject.  “The EU will be a bit more slow paced,” Wall said.  Gibbs agreed, adding he doesn’t see a sweeping ban on mining in the EU anytime soon. Litkins doesn’t see anything changing, adding that stable, profitable mining will only be available to those that own a renewable power source.  Wall argues that a ban on proof-of-work mining in the EU might end up being the “worst thing” for the environment globally. According to Wall, if countries that have the capacity to produce renewable energy in excess ban proof-of-work mining, it won’t make bitcoin go away, but only make it more lucrative for other nations to pick up on the demand. These other nations, Wall said, might not have access to the most sustainable sources of energy.  Wall pointed to Iran where a highly pollutive type of oil was being burned to produce energy between 2018 and 2019, with some devastating environmental consequences. Last year, a report found Iran was using proceeds from bitcoin mining to evade U.S. sanctions.  “You can maybe think of ways to tax it or subsidize it. But if you ban it, it’s just going to move it around,” Wall said.  Bruschi said this argument may have a point as miners began relocating to other countries following China’s ban.  Overland disagrees.  “I think this is a weak argument. It is like saying: If we don’t make it – weapons, drugs, child pornography, crypto mining, whatever – somebody else will, so we might as well do it,” Overland said. “Norway uses this argument a lot about its oil, claiming that it is cleaner than other oil and that it is better if oil is produced by a democracy than authoritarian countries. From a climate perspective, this argument makes little sense.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/09/crypto-advocates-push-back-on-swedens-call-for-eu-mining-ban,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb7881f8d3c2557719d6c4303808018dadf07e6c-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin saw some selling from the $45,000 level on Tuesday to as low as $42,500. Prices, however, recovered to $44,200 in European trading hours.  Analysts said bitcoin could develop a continued surge towards the $50,000 level if the current momentum is maintained.  “Recovery in institutional demand for stocks late in the day on Tuesday helped bitcoin stay above the 50-day moving average,” explained Alex Kuptsikevich, analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. “Continued buying on the decline to this level will keep the technical picture bullish as upside momentum develops to $49-50K.”  “A sharp dip lower today or tomorrow will raise the issue of a false break and bring the sellers back into play, heading for $37-38K,” he cautioned, however.  Among the top ten cryptocurrencies, XRP, the native cryptocurrency of RippleNet, extended gains with a 3% surge in the past 24 hours. Prices for the payments token moved upward amid positive sentiment among investors pertaining to the ongoing Ripple v. SEC court case.  Bitfinex’s unus sed leo token, which trades under LEO, led gains among majors with a 46% increase in the past day. The increase came as U.S. federal officials seized nearly $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin tied to the 2016 hack of the crypto exchange Bitfinex.  LEO traded at $7.19 in European afternoon hours, increasing from lows of $4.98 on Tuesday. LEO hit all-time highs of $8.16 in early Asian trading hours but has since fallen 11.6%, data from analytics tool CoinGecko showed.  That move came as Bitfinex said in a statement it was trying to recover the seized bitcoin and use 80% of recovered funds to purchase and burn LEO in the open market.

42410936,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSvN,1644409800,Are Current Ethereum Layer 2 Networks Cheap Enough?,"With simple contract interactions now costing in the hundreds of dollars, Vitalik Buterin has shifted his focus to scaling Ethereum. Demand for blockspace on the mainnet has skyrocketed over the last year, and transaction fees are pricing many users out of using the most coveted decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  How is this being solved in the short term without sacrificing decentralization? Buterin claims, “Rollups are in the short and medium term, and possibly in the long term, the only trustless scaling solution for Ethereum.” Plenty of alternative layer 1 blockchains have looked for expandable systems outside of vertical rollups but have sacrificed liveliness, state growth and more, something the Ethereum developer community has taken a strong stance against.  Are current layer 2 companion networks cheap enough?  Read more: Ethereum Could Hold Lead as Dominant Smart-Contract Blockchain: Coinbase Analysts  “Rollups are significantly reducing fees for many Ethereum users: Optimism and Arbitrum frequently provide fees that are ~3-8x lower than the Ethereum base layer itself, and ZK rollups, which have better data compression and can avoid including signatures, have fees ~40-100x lower than the base layer,” said Buterin.  Even without token subsidies, these rollups have seen significant adoption and are highlighting the demand for cheaper access to Ethereum. Arbitrum, for example, currently has over $2 billion in total value locked (TVL) and is home to a DeFi ecosystem that is beginning to show some promise. However, Buterin believes rollup fees must be even cheaper if they are going to encourage adoption in payments, gaming, and Web 3-focused products.  A future of 'blobs' and sharding on Ethereum  While the merge to proof-of-stake is still several months away, and sharding is likely even further down the road, Buterin proposed to implement an aspect of sharding before the upgrade is actually incorporated into Ethereum. By introducing “blob-carrying transactions,” a type of data-intensive transaction that will be implemented under sharding, rollups would have 1-2 MB of dedicated data space for posting blocks to mainnet.  The extra space would create a separate fee market, allowing fees to be substantially lower while only a few rollups access the system. This means the early implementation would only improve scalability by a fraction of what is capable under sharding, but it would provide short term relief to current users of layer 2s.  Of course there are drawbacks to the implementation. First, rollup teams will have to make the switch from utilizing calldata under their current format to blob-style transactions after the upgrade. Also, the implementation would increase the size of the short-term execution payload, which could put mild stress on the network’s validators. Buterin has also suggested counter proposals that would bring short term relief to high rollup transaction fees, like EIP 4488, which would lower the costs for transactions using calldata instead of switching to a new type of transaction entirely.  However, once sharding is implemented the same rollups would still have to make this change to stay competitive with other layer 2s on transaction fees. Regardless, the increased load will be temporary because blob data would only need to be stored for 30 to 60 days before expiry. The upgrade would be a big first step in making Ethereum accessible, thereby eliminating one of the largest arguments against the network at the moment. Cheap fees into perpetuity may just be enough to take market share back from the alternative layer 1 ecosystems, but the fight for dominance is likely just getting started.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week.

Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Vitalik Buterin, Peter Szilagyi and Emin Gun Sirer debated the key differences in scalability between Ethereum and Avalanche. BACKGROUND: The Avalanche core team has made several claims that its consensus model has improved upon the “bottleneck” Ethereum is currently dealing with. Ethereum developers have long debated this, arguing the state growth of the nearly seven-year-old chain makes any easy scaling implementation a threat to decentralization.  BuzzFeed News uncovered and revealed the identities of the Bored Ape founders. BACKGROUND: The founders of one of the largest NFT projects by both floor price and volume had developed and launched the NFTs anonymously, like many other builders in the crypto industry. The nature of open-source code and decentralization makes this uniquely possible, but BuzzFeed News and others have called into question the ethos of anonymity and sparked a wider debate.  A U.S. Federal Reserve research team released a report on the drawbacks of stablecoins. BACKGROUND: Just weeks after the first stablecoin report that looked at the potential for payments in the future spoke highly of stablecoins, another central bank research team argued against the digital assets. Locking dollars up to back the stablecoins could create liquidity issues within the economy due to the lack of “safe, liquid assets,” the report stated. DeFi projects have continued to look for ways to create non dollar-dependent stablecoins, using collateralized crypto assets and algorithms to keep the assets at peg.  Polygon raised $450 million from Sequoia Capital, Softbank and Tiger Global in a discounted token sale. BACKGROUND: Polygon now has a war chest to continue building its current ecosystem and simultaneously develop Ethereum scaling products Hermez, Miden, Zero and Nightfall. The team plans to use the capital to onboard the next billion users onto Ethereum and help keep developer talent around even during a sustained crypto bear market.

Of course not! Many of these users also hold cryptocurrencies with far smaller market caps.

In November, the firm raised a $5 million Series A round.  Hayvn offers crypto trading, custody, asset management and payment services to institutional clients and has around $75 million in assets under management (AUM).  In December, Hayvn won regulatory approval from Abu Dhabi Global Markets. It aims to receive investment from Gulf sovereign wealth funds in the next four months, CEO Christopher Flinos told Reuters.  Flinos added that the firm will pursue a $150 million initial public offering (IPO) once it hits a $1.5 billion valuation, which is expected in the 12 to 16 months.  Along with its native Abu Dhabi, Hayvn will also considering listing on exchanges in New York, London, Toronto or ones in Europe. ""I would love to do one in Abu Dhabi. But you have a responsibility to your shareholders to do it in the place where you get the best liquidity and the best valuation,"" Flinos said.  Flinos said that Hayvn has held talks with five sovereign wealth funds from the Persian Gulf region, as well those from northern Europe and Asia to manage their crypto investments.

Bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This is a small increase above the $146,000 goal set last year. In order for Bitcoin to attain the aforementioned goal, the dominant cryptocurrency would have to match the private sector&apos;s $2.7 trillion investment in gold. On November 10, Bitcoin&apos;s market capitalization reached $1.3 trillion. At the same time, the bank claims that the flagship cryptocurrency&apos;s fair value is now around $38,000, which is roughly 13% lower than where it is currently trading on major spot exchanges. JPMorgan&apos;s conclusion is based on the fact that Bitcoin&apos;s volatility is four times greater than gold&apos;s. To become more valuable, the crypto monarch would have to become significantly less volatile. JPMorgan sees another bear market as the main impediment to Bitcoin adoption: The biggest issue for Bitcoin moving forward is its volatility, as well as the boom-bust cycles that stymie its institutional adoption. The rally has been put on hold. On January 24, Bitcoin plummeted to a multi-month low of $32,950 before staging a stunning rebound.

Correlations on Jan. 31 between bitcoin and the S&P 500 stock index, and between bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index reached all-time highs and the 99.73 percentile, respectively, analysts led by Alkesh Shah wrote Tuesday.  The correlation between bitcoin and gold, a metal that’s often treated as an inflation hedge or store of value, has stayed at close to zero since June of last year, the bank noted.  The digital asset’s volatility has fallen from the highs seen in 2013, but it remains elevated relative to the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and gold, the report said.  The volatile price means that bitcoin is unlikely to be adopted as an inflation hedge for investors in developed countries but “individuals living in inflationary environments may view bitcoin as an inflation hedge,” the report added.

V1 CryptoPunks was blacklisted by Larva Labs as more collectors flocked to the project. OpenSea controversially delisted the whole collection, and the community is outraged. While it is still unclear whether CryptoPunks V1 is what it claims to be legal, many members of the community appear to have already made up their minds.

The metric decreased by more than 1,660 bitcoins on Saturday and 1,733 bitcoins on Sunday, according to analytics tool Glassnode. This amounts to over $147 million at current prices, according to tracking tool CoinGecko.  The weekend’s sale was the first for 2022, after a previous selling period in November.  Over the past two months, miners have been continuously accumulating bitcoin even as prices fell from $55,000 to $35,000, research firm Delphi Digital said in a daily note.  “With the weekend pump, miners are starting to offload their BTC holdings as Miner Net Position Change turned negative for the first time in 2 months,” the analysts wrote.

The Russian government and central bank are currently working on a draught law that will designate cryptocurrency as a currency analogue rather than a digital financial asset, which is due to be released on February 18. Only complete identification through the banking system or regulated intermediaries would allow cryptocurrencies to function in the legal industry.

All of these crypto services must be done through a digital currency exchange organizer (a bank) or a peer-to-peer exchange licensed in the country.

42423759,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2g9Hh,1644401422,"Russia to Regulate Crypto, Dispelling Fears of Ban","Instead of banning cryptocurrencies, the Russian government has decided to regulate them, legitimizing a $2 trillion asset class in the world’s 11th-largest economy.  A document setting the principles for the regulation of cryptocurrencies appeared on the government’s official website on Tuesday night. Notably, the plan has the support of the central bank, which had called for a ban on crypto mining and trading.  This is the second major regulatory cloud to have been lifted from the global crypto market in a month. India last week took a step toward legalization with a tax on digital asset transfers. While it carries a hefty rate (30%), the tax was seen by many as putting the fifth-largest economy on track toward legitimizing crypto.  In Russia (population 144 million), residents own over 12 million cryptocurrency accounts and about 2 trillion rubles ($26.7 billion) worth of crypto, according to the government's document (PDF in Russian).  It says the country ranks third in the world in bitcoin mining, a share the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance agrees with. With such a large volume of crypto, law enforcement agencies are concerned they can't adequately approach crimes involving crypto, the document said.  Yet, it stopped short of the draconian measures suggested in January by the Bank of Russia. The central bank’s report called cryptocurrencies a threat to Russia's financial stability and rife with fraud. The regulator suggested banning cryptocurrency trading in Russia, as well as mining. Instead, Russians would have access to the digital ruble, the central bank digital currency in the works by the Bank of Russia, and digital assets issued inside the country by licensed companies.  By contrast, the government’s blueprint released Tuesday says cryptocurrency purchases in Russia may take place, but only through locally registered and licensed companies so that users are fully verified and information about their transactions can be made available to government agencies. The document does not address cryptocurrency mining. Many of the stipulations require parliament to pass new laws.  Chain analysis, but no Chainalysis  All crypto-related transactions bigger than 600,000 rubles would have to be reported to the Federal Taxation Service. Failure to do so should be considered a felony, and using cryptocurrency to conduct a crime should be an aggravating factor, the report said.  The proposal suggests allowing banks to operate as intermediaries between users and cryptocurrency exchanges. The institutions would need to verify users' identities, check transactions for signs of illegal activity, provide rails for fiat transfers and keep information about transactions for at least five years. Banks should also provide users the documents necessary to report their taxes, and government agencies data about transactions on the request.  Cryptocurrency exchanges and peer-to-peer marketplaces would have to register as legal entities and join an official register of digital-currency exchange operators. They would have to open a crypto account with an authorized bank and satisfy certain requirements applying to traditional financial organizations. Foreign exchanges would be required to have an office in Russia and be registered there.  Banks working with crypto exchanges would be required to use the Transparent Blockchain transaction tracking tool developed by Rosfinmonitoring (Russia's FinCEN equivalent) not products from foreign companies like Chainalysis, Elliptic or Crystal Blockchain. According to the document, Transparent Blockchain can help identify owners of cryptocurrency wallets using open-source data, as well as information from the darknet, detect patterns of illegal usage of crypto and serve as a register of addresses related to crimes and terrorism financing.  According to the announcement, the proposal was agreed on by the Bank of Russia, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Development, Federal Taxation Agency, anti-money laundering watchdog Rosfinmonitoring and the key law enforcement bodies: Ministry of the Interior, Federal Security Service and the Prosecutor General's office. Earlier, the Bank of Russia had been a dissenting voice.  According to the newspaper Kommersant, the approach puts cryptocurrencies on a level with foreign currencies, which are regulated in a similar fashion. The new laws and directives are likely to come into force in the second half of 2022 or early 2023, Kommersant said.  Market impact  Bitcoin’s price rose about 3% Wednesday morning in the U.S. Russia’s embrace might be having “some level of influence” on the bellwether cryptocurrency's price, said Armando Aguilar, an independent crypto analyst. Other market factors including KPMG Canada adding BTC to its balance sheet and the U.S. Justice Department's recovery of $3.6 billion in bitcoin from the 2016 Bitfinex hack could also be buoying prices, he said.  ""We could see other governments adopting BTC in the near future with Russia making the move,"" Aguilar told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  Anto Paroian, chief operating officer at digital assets investment firm ARK36, said Russia's move ""reflects a broader shift in regulatory attitudes towards these assets in various jurisdictions around the world.""  ""The political and economic cost of banning"" crypto will outweigh the risk to governments from allowing it to ""coexist with legacy financial institutions,"" Paroian said.  In his newsletter Wednesday, crypto investor and blogger Anthony Pompliano noted that U.S. President Joe Biden's threat of sanctions against Russia – including cutting off the country's economy from much of the global financial system – might reinforce the case for bitcoin as ""censorship-resistant money.""  ""It is weird that the central bank of Russia started to question bitcoin’s relevance in the country at the same time that it may become incredibly important to the nation state,"" Pompliano wrote.  Similarly, Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K-.based digital-asset broker GlobalBlock, said in an email that ""aside from the huge tax revenue, Russia could be using bitcoin to hedge against aggressive U.S. foreign policy.""

Metaverses generally describe a virtual world in which people can interact as they do in the real world, but digitally. The concept has gained steam in recent years, with metaverse tokens like Decentraland's MANA and Axie Infinity's AXS worth billions of dollars.  “The Metaverse is set to be one of the biggest areas within crypto for many to enjoy…using it as another great resource to offer crypto communities incentivization, content, and regular royalties,” Shiba Inu developers said in a blog post.  The so-called “Shiba Lands” would be found inside the upcoming Shiba Inu metaverse and will be available for purchase or auction using LEASH tokens.  Developers said they are working on a ""queue system"" designed for the Shiba Lands sales event. Participants earn a place in the queue based on the amount of LEASH they hold. Such a system would prevent opportunistic bots from snapping up land early at low prices to sell them at a higher price to the community.  Prices of LEASH tokens were up nearly 46% in the past 24 hours, data from analytics tool CoinGecko show. SHIB has a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, with half locked away, while LEASH has only 107,647 minted tokens.  Meanwhile, SHIB fell 8% in the past 24 hours after rising nearly 40% on Monday and Tuesday.

According to their calculations, the state could collect between 90 and 180 billion rubles (1.2 and 2.4 billion US dollars) per year from legal crypto exchanges and pocket an additional 606 billion rubles (8 billion US dollars) by taxing the income from cryptocurrency investments, depending on the tax rate.The post Moscow Could Pocket $13B in Crypto Tax Each Year appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/moscow-could-pocket-13b-in-crypto-tax-each-year/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42423776,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2g9nh,1644386218,"Crypto Analytics Tools 'Wave of the Future, Dude,' Judge Quotes Cult Film in $3.6B Bitcoin Seizure Case","Citing a basketball star, the Dude (a character in the cult classic film ""The Big Lebowski"") and ""Star Trek: First Contact,"" a federal judge praised the cryptocurrency analytics tools that helped lead federal agents to yesterday’s multibillion-dollar bitcoin trove.  In an August 2021 opinion unsealed yesterday tied to a search warrant that helped nab nearly 100,000 stolen Bitfinex bitcoins, U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui cast blockchain tracing technology as a powerful tool to meet probable cause requirements.  CoinDesk acquired a copy of the memorandum from a source familiar with the case.  Faruqui’s memorandum opinion – summarizing the Washington district court's approval of a search warrant for email accounts – highlights the influential role private-sector tracing software plays in the federal government's crypto investigations.  That influence was pivotal in the Bitfinex money laundering case, according to Faruqui, who has delved into crypto issues in past memoranda. He said the case agent's affidavit clearly showed how industry software techniques led his investigation to the suspects' email accounts.  Federal agents wrote that they acquired the addresses and private keys to 2,000 wallets after obtaining a warrant to search the defendants' cloud storage services. It's unclear whether this was the same warrant.  Read more: DC Magistrate Judge Calls Unhosted Wallet 'Horror Story' a 'Fiction'  ""Cryptocurrency and related software analytics tools are 'the wave of the future, Dude. One hundred percent electronic,'"" Faruqui concluded, tipping his hat to Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski, the rug-loving stoner lead character in the 1998 movie ""The Big Lebowski.""  Faruqui, who as a former prosecutor conducted federal crypto investigations, said the tracing industry's sleuthing techniques – like clustering, which divines patterns from inherently public crypto transaction data – have emerged as ""one of the most reliable bases for a search ever.""  ""Going 50 for 50 is beyond what could be expected of a mere human,"" he said, apparently referring to the success rate of clustering-derived subpoenas in the Welcome to Video investigation he helped lead (and also referencing National Basketball Association star Damian Lillard in a footnote).  Clustering techniques help investigators determine what addresses belong to suspects, according to Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, a tracing company. In a previous interview with CoinDesk, Robinson called clustering the blockchain analytics industry's ""special sauce.""  Indeed, legal documents released Tuesday detail Internal Revenue Service agents' focus on a ""specific cluster"" of crypto wallet addresses that led them to Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, the Manhattan couple arrested on charges of money laundering stemming from a hack of the Bitfinex crypto exchange in 2016.  See more: 'Like Genghis Khan, but With More Pizzazz': What We Know About the Accused Bitfinex Money Launderers  ""Humans are 'Flawed. Weak. Organic,' whereas clustering software strives for perfection,"" Faruqui said, partially quoting the 1996 film ""Star Trek: First Contact.""  Unfortunately for lawyerly pop culture nerds, Faruqui's spunky references aren't part of binding legal precedent. Memorandum opinions summarize court decisions; they don't set them in stone.  This one nevertheless represents a shift in how judges think about evidence derived from crypto tracing software, according to Ari Redbord, a former federal prosecutor who now leads industry player TRM Labs' policy division.  ""For the first time ever, the Court analyzes the weight and reliability of blockchain evidence finding that blockchain analytics tools like TRM Labs are reliable and can form the basis of probable cause for a warrant,"" Redbord wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  The full extent to which IRS agents used blockchain tracing technology isn't clear yet.  IRS-CI has signed multimillion-dollar contracts with Chainalysis, Elliptic and TRM Labs; all had something to say following yesterday's news.  What is clear is that their tools have emerged a critical component of federal crypto investigations. The are powerful enough to lead investigators to suspects' doorstep and persuasive enough to yield warrants that open them.  But there's another, simpler take away from the Bitfinex hack's latest twist: Pricey software or no, it's very difficult to get away with on-chain crypto theft.  ""These people were absolute F***** morons,"" said one source in the tracing industry. ""Starting with: stealing a couple billion in the world's most transparent and traceable assets.""

What&apos;s interesting about the raise is the way Alchemy has managed to grow in valuation in a relatively short period of time. For instance, in April of 2021, the blockchain start-up was valued at $505 million following an $80 million Series B investment. Six months later in October 2021, the firm hit $3.5 billion after a $250 million Series C round. This signifies that the startup has nearly managed to triple its valuation since October and by almost 20 times since last April. &apos;Everyone&apos;s looking for a way to get involved in the space, and what they realized was Alchemy is the backbone for all of these things. We still think this is the first inning of Web3,&apos; Alchemy co-founder and chief technology officer Joe Lau told CNBC in an interview. With the fresh round of fundraising, the company said that they will be using the funds to expand the team and doubling down, and investing in the Web3 ecosystem.

Nevertheless, it has been a good run for bitcoin coming out of the weekend. As the cryptocurrency has made its bottom above $43,000, what could be expected going forward? Bitcoin In Four-Year Cycles As bitcoin has settled above $43,000, looking at other metrics to figure out where the digital asset may be headed has become imperative. In this report, we take a look at bitcoin through 4-year cycles and what it has often meant for the asset. Four years is important to the movement of bitcoin given that things like halvings happen in such timeframes. But for this, we take a look at the monthly EMA50 and how it works as the last correctional support before takeoff.

42423769,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2g9bh,1644368400,Infinity Ventures Crypto Closes $70M Fund,"Infinity Ventures Crypto, a Taipei-based Web 3 investor, said it raised $70 million to deploy to startups in Asia and the Americas in its first fund, which closed today.  The fund’s strength is bridging the gap between the east, particularly southeast Asia, and the west, partner Brian Lu said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Circle, Digital Currency Group and Animoca Brands participated in the fund, according to a release. (DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Lu said the fund is oversubscribed, and he doesn’t want it to grow too large because Web 3 companies look for smaller rounds. They might be raising only $1 million or less, Lu said, and average check sizes could be in the range of $250,000. The fund is already 30% deployed, with 80 deals complete.  While Lu sits in Taipei, his fund is global with a split of 55% Asia and 35% Americas.  Lu points to crypto wallet MetaMask, which disclosed that its top countries for active users include the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand, as creating investor interest in Asia-focused Web 3 projects.  Another of the fund's partners is Richie Jiaravanon, whose family runs CP Group, one of Thailand’s largest business conglomerates. With COVID-19 restricting travel, Lu said Jiaravanon's location in southeast Asia helps with a ""boots on the ground"" approach that’s impossible over Zoom.  The only way IVC was able to get onto the cap table – or list of token holders – for Philippines-based gaming guild YGG, the majority of which had been taken up by a16z, was a promise to help expand YGG across southeast Asia into markets like Thailand.  There are more funds in the works, Lu said, as he wants to start one every year and a half.  Lu is also an active Software as a Service (SaaS) investor and partner at venture firm Headline’s Asia office, which counts Groupon and dating app Bumble in its portfolio.

Bulls are now aiming to beef up their defense at the $43,000 support level. According to TradingView data, after reaching a weekly high of $45,500 early on Feb. 8, bears were able to lower the price of Bitcoin to $42,900 during afternoon trading as investors realized profits and prepared to place bids at $38,000. At the time of writing, the pioneer token is worth $44,091. Bitcoin Steadies At $44k Bitcoin (BTC) bulls have successfully returned the main digital currency&apos;s price to the $44K support level, boosted by encouraging occurrences. Most notably, the Canadian subsidiary of accounting major KPMG recently announced that it has integrated BTC and ETH to its corporate treasury. In addition, Tesla Inc reported in a recently filed 10-K that it possessed nearly $2 billion in BTC at the end of last year. The quick rise caught many traders off surprise, as headlines across the crypto community predicted the start of a lengthy bear market, but such grim predictions may have been premature, according to data from a recent Glassnode research.
