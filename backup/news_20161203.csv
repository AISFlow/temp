42427171,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0B3h,1480784046,What the IRS Summons Will Mean for Coinbase Users,"Daniel Winters, MS Taxation, is the owner of Global Tax Accountants and a specialist in bitcoin and cryptocurrency taxation.  In this op-ed, Winters explores the ramifications of the recent court order approving a summons by the IRS for user records held by bitcoin exchange Coinbase.  I’m a bitcoin and cryptocurrency accountant, and I don’t have good news: The IRS hammer is coming down.  Although the IRS issued guidance in March 2014 concerning income from bitcoin and ""virtual currencies"" (the IRS term), there has been no enforcement mechanism to ensure that bitcoin income is actually reported to the IRS.  Having failed to create an enforcement mechanism, the IRS is taking a brute-force approach. The John Doe summons authorized on 30th November demands that Coinbase provide complete transaction records for all users between 1st January, 2013 and 31th December 2015.  If the IRS succeeds in forcing Coinbase to turn over their records, this would be a massive invasion of privacy and guilt by association. Not all bitcoiners are tax cheats – I have a Coinbase account myself, and report every satoshi.  The situation is reminiscent of the John Doe summons which the IRS issued in 2009 during the UBS Bank offshore banking scandal.  UBS had set up Swiss bank accounts to hide hundreds of millions of dollars belonging to US citizens. Swiss banking secrecy cracked, UBS sent a list of names to the IRS, and individuals were prosecuted.  UBS paid a fine of $780m and some Americans with UBS bank accounts paid fines in the millions and went to prison.  Following this scandal, Congress passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). This forces all non-US financial institutions to report directly to the IRS the income and other information for accounts held by US citizens.  The IRS has a huge database to gather the information from thousands of banks around the globe.  What’s the significance of the John Doe summons?  A court document from 18th November, 2016 had detailed testimony in support of issuing the summons.  Here’s the skinny:  The IRS has begun an investigation of United States persons who conducted transactions in a convertible virtual currency during 2013 to 2015. Bitcoin is a convertible virtual currency. The purpose of the investigation is to determine the correct taxes due for those US persons.  There are IRS employees with excellent, detailed knowledge of the entire bitcoin ecosystem. This includes mining bitcoins, trading bitcoins on a virtual currency exchange, receiving bitcoin as payment for goods/services, and every type of transaction in between.  The IRS doesn’t know the identity of people who may have avoided paying taxes on bitcoin transactions. The John Doe summons would create a class of people, then Coinbase would need to provide information on that entire class.  The IRS agent who wrote the declaration is extremely experienced regarding off-shore arrangements to avoid paying taxes. He works in the Offshore Compliance Initiative, an IRS program the purpose of which is finding taxpayers who have hidden money offshore and avoided paying their taxes. The agent is now assigned to find taxpayers that used bitcoin to avoid paying taxes. His responsibilities are not limited to investigating only offshore structures.  The IRS agent was involved in the audit of an individual taxpayer concerning offshore arrangements to avoid taxes. The taxpayer admitted using bitcoin to avoid paying taxes.  The IRS agent was also involved in the audit of two corporate taxpayers, each of which had annual revenues of several million dollars and had accounts at Coinbase. The taxpayers bought and sold bitcoin, and under-reported their income. The IRS audit did not go well for the taxpayers. The IRS denied deductions, which means income was increased. It was not stated in the declaration, but in this situation the IRS will force the taxpayer to pay additional taxes on the income which was not reported.  How does the IRS know about your bitcoin income?  Most types of income are reported directly to the IRS. Stock sales are reported on form 1099-B, and wages are reported on form W-2. If you forget to include a 1099 on your taxes, the IRS will send you a letter demanding that you pay tax on the unreported income.  However, bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that allows us to exchange value between addresses on the bitcoin network. The Internal Revenue Service does not receive a data feed from transactions on the bitcoin network.  Therefore, the IRS can receive information in three ways:  The honor system. This is the main method for reporting bitcoin transactions. My clients and I review bitcoin/cryptocurrency transactions, and file tax returns to report those transactions.  Per the March 2014 Notice, payments in bitcoin to contractors or employees must be reported on 1099 and W-2 forms. The company must convert the BTC amount to USD using the exchange rate effective for that day. Bitcoin transactions are not reported separately, the IRS just wants the USD amount.  The companies which operate the on-ramps to the bitcoin ecosystem send information to the IRS.  For many bitcoin users in the US, Coinbase is their on-ramp. Although Coinbase users can generate reports listing their bitcoin transactions, and run a report for any capital gains or losses, to my knowledge Coinbase does not file 1099 forms with the IRS to report gains or losses from bitcoin transactions.  Because Coinbase is a payment processor, converting bitcoin to USD, they do issue Form 1099-K for merchants which have more than $20,000 of gross sales and more than 200 transactions in a given year. Form 1099-K is also used by other payment processors such as Amazon or Paypal.  So, Coinbase is filing 1099-K forms for merchants with transactions above the threshold, but is not filing 1099s for the transactions of individual users.  This brings us back to the honor system, and the IRS has decided that the honor system isn’t good enough for bitcoin.  What does this mean for me?  Coinbase plans to fight the John Doe summons. If forced to comply, Coinbase will provide data on user transactions for 2013 to 2015.  If the lawyers cut a deal and Coinbase ends up providing information only for users with transactions above a certain threshold, the IRS will not reveal the threshold. Obviously, the IRS wants to scare people into voluntarily reporting all their bitcoin income.  Sorry, I warned you this wasn’t good news.  If you had a Coinbase account during 2013, 2014 and 2015 and accurately reported your bitcoin income, you have nothing to worry about.  If you did not report the income from your Coinbase transactions during that period, well, you may have a serious problem.  Assuming Coinbase provides transaction histories, then the IRS could use that information to audit your taxes and confirm you reported your bitcoin transactions.  You may not be informed if your records are sent to the IRS, and may find out only when you receive a nasty letter from the IRS demanding payment of the tax due on the bitcoin income.  To avoid this situation, you may want to consider filing amended tax returns to report any bitcoin income which was not previously reported. You should contact your tax advisor if you want to discuss your individual circumstances.  What would Friedrich Hayek say?  In conclusion, maybe we should also look at the IRS subpoena from another perspective.  Hayek predicted the emergence of private currencies that would compete against the traditional fiat currencies issued by sovereign governments.  Today we have bitcoin, founded on the proposition that we can all be our own bank, and be responsible for storing our own wealth in the form of Bitcoins.  It’s easy to fling bitcoins around the world, but not easy to track our transactions for tax purposes. Unfortunately, dealing with taxes is part of the financial responsibility for being our own bank.  Some people will undoubtedly say the IRS is threatened by bitcoin, that government wants to control cryptocurrency because it could bring down the fractional reserve banking system.  I don’t know, but one thing is for sure: There’s nothing certain in life but death and taxes!  Disclaimer: I am not an attorney. I have a Master’s of Taxation and own an accounting firm specializing in bitcoin and virtual currencies. I have written a course for CPAs about Bitcoin and Taxes and have a good understanding of how the IRS treats bitcoin transactions.  Nonetheless, this post is NOT legal advice, nor does it constitute advice regarding your personal tax situation. Under IRS Circular 230, I am not responsible for any positions you take on your tax return, unless I have prepared and signed that tax return.

42427174,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0B9h,1480775472,Bitcoin Prices Surge Past $770 But Fall Just Short of 2016 High,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 26th November through 2nd December.  Bitcoin prices neared $780 during the week through 2nd December, coming within 1% of the 2016 high of $781.31 reached in June.  The digital currency rose to a high of $778.14 amid sustained support. Prices remained above $700 all week and only briefly fell below $725, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals.  Bitcoin prices have been enjoying sustained support, as they have managed to stay north of $700 for more than two weeks, having surpassed that level on 14th November, BPI figures show.  The market is highly bullish, according to sentiment data provided by leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. Between 26th November and 1st December, the market fluctuated between 82% and 89% long, maintaining an average of 85% long during the six-day period.  Petar Zivkovski, Whaleclub’s director of operations, told CoinDesk:  ""Most traders are long on bitcoin. We've noticed an uptick in shorts in recent days as some contrarians try to pick the top, but those remain relatively rare.""  Zivkovski spoke to continued trader interest, telling CoinDesk that he also believes the price rise is fueled by new bitcoin buyers.  ""Price has made a series of higher highs and higher lows, which indicates that there is still enough new money coming in to the system to push price to new levels.""  Macroeconomic boost  Analysts indicate that bitcoin prices are further receiving support from a handful of macroeconomic developments that have helped drive market participants to the digital currency.  For example, China recently imposed additional capital controls in an effort to reign in outflows and help reduce the yuan’s continued slide against the US dollar.  As the Asian nation's efforts to control its currency continue to draw headlines, cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff pointed to data supporting the notion that China is playing a key role in bitcoin trading.  He told CoinDesk:  ""One thing the data does show is that the CNY price has led the USD one: currently $791 vs $770, a 3% spread, and over the last day often higher. This strongly suggests that, whatever the reason, buying is once again being driven by China.""  Another development that has stuck out as potentially supporting bitcoin’s recent price movements is India Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to take 500 and 1,000-rupee notes out of circulation. While this move has been justified as an attempt to help reduce corruption and black market activity, it could potentially push India into a liquidity crisis.  Modi has pointed to a survey, conducted through a smartphone app, which shows 90% of participants supporting the move to eliminate these banknotes from circulation. However, the move has drawn the opposition of both opposition parties as well as former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.  Zivkovski made reference to this situation, telling CoinDesk that he believes this situation has boosted bitcoin's outlook.  ""The Indian crackdown on cash/rupees has most probably contributed to the rise [in bitcoin prices] with the injection of fresh money and bitcoin users from India,"" he said.  Ether’s struggle  Elsewhere, ether, the digital currency powering the ethereum platform, continued to struggle this week, falling to its lowest price since April.  Ethereum has faced several challenges lately, including undergoing three forks in the space of a few months as the platform attempts to overcome technical challenges.  Ethereum underwent a hard fork dubbed ‘Spurious Dragon’ on 22nd November, which was an attempt to rectify some complications that stemmed from continued attacks on the network. An attacker had left a significant number of empty accounts in the blockchain, and Spurious Dragon gave developers a way to remove these accounts.  While this hard fork represented an improvement, two major Ethereum clients – Geth and Parity – implemented the code from this fork in different ways. As a result, there came a point where the two clients did not agree on deleting a certain account.  While Geth did delete the account, Parity failed to do so, which resulted in a brief split in the network or ""Thanksgiving fork"".  In spite of Ethereum’s continued challenges, several market observers have spoken out about the network’s recent progress, pointing to what they called progress in fundamentals such as mining distribution and unique address growth.  Zcash chills out  Zcash prices have calmed down a bit lately, trading in a range between $60 and $80 for most of the week, Poloniex figures reveal.  The digital currency traded within this range after experiencing far greater fluctuations earlier in the week, falling more than 25% from $89.45 at roughly 12:00 UTC on 26th November to $65.59 at 22:00 UTC on 27th November.  The currency’s available supply is now roughly 133,000 ZEC, a figure that represents less than 1% of the 21 million ZEC tokens that are scheduled to be mined over time.  Both Zivkovski and Eliosoff emphasized that at this point, adoption is crucial to supporting the price at current levels, given that supply will continue to increase.  Thus far, Zcash has showed promise by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs called zk-SNARKS to enable counterparties to conduct transactions without revealing themselves. However, the cryptocurrency has thus far obtained little adoption;  Until the digital currency has a viable use aside from trading, its value is highly speculative.
