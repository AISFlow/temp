42424982,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJPh,1372179635,Bitcoiners donate to WikiLeaks to support Edward Snowden,"Bitcoin donations to WikiLeaks increased 1,894% yesterday after Julian Assange pledged his support to whistle-blower Edward Snowden.  The Blockchain shows 0.36 bitcoins were transferred to the WikiLeaks wallet address on Sunday, increasing to 7.18 BTC on Monday, following Assange's telephone conference call with reporters.  ""I have personal sympathy with Snowden having gone through similar personal experiences,"" Time Magazine reports Assange as saying during the 75-minute call.  The WikiLeaks founder is currently residing in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has been for the past year, fighting extradition to Sweden on sexual-assault charges. He recently claimed he would not leave the embassy even if the sex charges were dropped as he fears moves are underway to extradite him to the US over the leaking of sensitive information to his whistle-blowing website.  Snowden, however, is currently on the run after leaking details of top-secret American and British government mass surveillance programs to the press.  Assange said yesterday that Snowden was ""healthy and safe"", but would not offer any further insight into where the 29-year-old was or when and how they had spoken. ""If we lived in a better world we would be able to go into those details. Unfortunately, we live in a world, as illuminated by Mr Snowden, where most communications are intercepted unlawfully.""  It was thought Snowden had travelled from Hong Kong to Russia on Sunday morning, but Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov announced today that the former technical contractor and CIA employee had not crossed the border into the country.  Wherever he is, it is thought he is now receiving bitcoin donations via WikiLeaks, allowing him to make transactions that cannot be traced by the CIA. This form of transfer also gives anonymity to those making donations.  ""Supporters know their donation is more difficult to track back to them than a wire transfer would be,"" said Tuur Demeester of MacroTrends.  Since Assange's talk with the press yesterday, 14.85 BTC (currently worth around $1,568) have been donated to WikiLeaks.  Back in December 2010, Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union blocked donations to WikiLeaks following the release of secret US diplomatic cables the previous month. There are fears a similar block could be enforced again in the future, which is another reason why bitcoin donations are increasing in popularity.  ""WikiLeaks supporters know their donations cannot be blocked and that funds that are not used immediately will appreciate over time,"" said Demeester.  He went on to explain that the 800 BTC donated to WikiLeaks up until August last year was worth approximately $8,000 at the time, but now those same bitcoins are worth ten times that amount – around $80,000.  But perhaps the increase in bitcoin donations is motivated by more than just a desire for anonymity and confidence that the currency will appreciate in value, maybe it is a further display of bitcoiners' anti-government sentiment and their championing of freedom of information.  ""I think it confirms that freedom of speech and the right to privacy are indeed values that are dear to the bitcoin community,"" said Demeester.  ""Rather than posting a meme on Facebook, people are discovering that, with Bitcoin, they can send actual resources straight to the heart of the cause they wish to support – in this case WikiLeaks and the courageous Mr Snowden,"" he concluded.

42424978,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJLh,1372173761,Has the market lost confidence in Mt. Gox?,"Mt. Gox clarified its position on US dollar withdrawals Friday, after worrying customer feedback over its USD withdrawal freeze. But it faced yet more problems early this week as it reported system downtime to frustrated traders. As it struggles to reassure bitcoin users, what will the long-term implications be for the exchange, and for the bitcoin market overall?  In a post to its Google+ account, Mt. Gox acknowledged “mixed reactions” from customers after it announced on Thursday that it would temporarily freeze withdrawals in US dollars.  “Our bank can no longer handle the volume of withdrawals,” the exchange said, adding that it had struggled in the last two months. It is working with the bank to find an alternative method to get money to its customers, it said. For the time being, it is manually processing US dollar withdrawals itself. “This will take more time, but we are dedicated to doing as many per day as possible,” it added.  But this is the latest in a series of confidence-shaking events at Mt. Gox. Last month, the US Department of Homeland Security pulled the plug on Mt. Gox’s account with the Dwolla online payment network, complaining that Mt. Gox was a money transmission business (MTB), and as such was violating regulations by operating without a license. It also suffered several denial of service attacks.  Now, the market appears to be losing confidence in Mt. Gox. BitPay announced last week that it had temporarily stopped using the exchange for determining the exchange rate for its invoices. Instead, it will be using a blended mix from multiple exchanges.  As users work out how to withdraw their dollars from an exchange which now appears to be processing transactions by hand, the obvious question is: what is the future for Mt. Gox?  Some are not surprised at its latest travails. “In my experience, Mt. Gox always had delays with withdrawals,” points out Meni Rosenfeld, a leading light in the Israeli bitcoin community, and the founder of Bitcoil, an Israeli bitcoin exchange. “I just took it for granted that withdrawing from them isn’t reliable if needed in a timely manner, so I don’t really see that much difference between the current situation and the previous one,” he said.  Bitcoil has suffered its own problems, however; it ceased operations on March 6 and is hoping to resume trading at some point, but opposition from banks is his biggest problem, he says.  In tracking Mt. Gox's fortunes, it is important to understand where the company came from. It started as an exchange for playing cards used in the Magic: the Gathering trading card game. The company had to endure massive scaling challenges, as it began trading bitcoins, and volumes increased.  The engine clearly needs some upgrading. Adding to the company's woes, the firm was forced to announce this week that it had experienced downtime preventing customers from accessing the site. Rather than a DDoS attack, this time it attributed the problem to a system error.  ""We were alerted to an error in the file system that had triggered a kernel panic, resulting in a server freeze,"" it reported. ""At that point we had to restart the server manually and proceeded with a fsck (filesystem check) which took some time.""  The company has announced that it will be upgrading its trading engine, and is migrating its server from a hosting provider to its own data center. The new trading system is described as ""smokin’ fast"". Let's hope so.  In the meantime, pundits predict that other exchanges will pick up the slack, gathering valuable market share while Mt. Gox pushes back from the ropes. “Big winners for this announcement will probably be Bitstamp and other exchanges like that, that have better banking infrastructures,” said Charles Hoskinson, cryptocurrency expert and the founder of the Bitcoin Education Project. “We will probably see a larger market share for MTBs like LocalBitcoins as well.”  The charts show significant volatility in the past week. US dollar trading volume on Mt. Gox took a dive on June 19, before recovering slightly and then tanking again. Bitstamp volumes tracked these movements, although in a far less volatile manner. At one point on Saturday, it almost looked as though Bitstamp bitcoin trading volumes would exceed Mt. Gox volumes.  In the longer term, Mt. Gox is losing traction. “Over time, Mt. Gox’s monopoly has decreased. Year by year, the percentage of trading volume held by Mt. Gox has gone down. And so people are starting to move to other exchanges,” said Hoskinson.  Volume is certainly down. Earlier this year, Mt. Gox processed around 80% of transactions. This has fallen to 54%.  Perhaps the biggest worry for the bitcoin market in the short term is liquidity. Trading volume and liquidity go hand-in-hand, and with confidence eroding in Mt. Gox, market liquidity could suffer. ""In the short-term, it isn't great,"" said Jesse Heaslip, cofounder of exchange hosting service Bex.io. ""But long-term, it will be good for the ecosystem to not have one major fail point.""  Mt. Gox is one step along a longer road, argues Jeff Garzik, now employed full-time by BitPay in his role as one of the core development team for Bitcoin. “While absolutely, Mt. Gox has been the market leader for quite a while, there are several competitors coming up,” he said, adding that there are more exchanges operating currently than we’ve seen in a while. “From a long-time bitcoin user's perspective, things just keep getting better.”  The big opportunity for the next up-and-coming exchange will be getting state-level regulator approval across the entire US, Garzik predicts. Companies are already shooting for this goal (although they're going to have problems in California and New York, among other places). The first one past the finish line stands to make millions of dollars, he predicts, especially because its systems will likely have been built from the ground up with bitcoin trading in mind.  In the meantime, Mt. Gox is not only attempting to recover from its recent problems, but is also preparing to list Litecoin, as early as next month.  ""We're looking at July right now, that depends on a few things,"" it said. ""Mainly, we want to do things correctly from the beginning.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/25/has-the-market-lost-confidence-in-mt-gox,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfb955add3c2c798db16a9463d349788e8a25bb8-599x337.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424979,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJNh,1372154643,Raspberry Pi used as Block Erupter controller for bitcoin mining,"As unlikely as it sounds, the Adafruit learning blog (via the Hackaday blog) has just shown off a Raspberry Pi based bitcoin miner. For those who haven't heard of the Raspberry Pi, it's a small computer on a single circuit board that was designed to be inexpensive enough to help children learn about computer science. Inevitably, hobbyists have taken the Pi to their hearts and put these tiny computers to all sorts of uses, now including mining bitcoins.  While this isn't the first Pi to be used in connection with bitcoin mining, it's a good illustration of how a Pi can be put to use in this way.  Of course, a Raspberry Pi itself has nowhere near the required computational power to effectively mine bitcoins. However, USB powered Asicminer Block Erupters do. The Raspberry Pi in this example is hooked up to a USB hub that is running four of these 333Mh/s devices. Then, via the Pi's GPIO pins, a small LCD displays the average hash rate of all the miners together (around 1.3GH/s) as calculated by the cgminer software.  According to the Bitcoin forum, these USB miners are now worth 0.99 BTC each, with approved forum members buying sets of 50 or more to sell onto end users. Therefore, that's a total of £263.78 GBP, plus roughly £60 GBP for the Raspberry Pi and powered USB hub. So there's an upfront cost of £323.78 GBP (and that's not counting the extra electronics that need putting together) to make back from mining at 1.3Gh/s.

42424968,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJ1h,1372151614,Bitcoin network recovering from DDoS attack,"Last week, the Bitcoin network suffered from a denial-of-service attack that forced the core development team to patch the core reference design.  Details are sketchy. CoinDesk first received word of the problem from core developer Jeff Garzik. ""Currently dealing with an ongoing, network-wide event,"" he told us in a hurried email.  Last Friday, Gavin Andreesen announced a forthcoming 0.8.3 release of the reference implementation. ""This will fix a denial of service attack that affects some network nodes,"" he said, adding that details would be released after the fix.  Garzik differentiates between miners and nodes in the Bitcoin network. Non-mining nodes are not revenue generating, but instead relay transactions on a voluntary basis, for the good of the network. These nodes can be a point of attack for those wanting to harm the bitcoin network.  He describes 51% attacks, which can be extremely costly and difficult to mount, as the lowest worry on his list. “Operationally, network attacks are far cheaper,” he said. “Any smart attacker is going to look for a cheaper way to attack bitcoin. Network attacks are one of the big worries right now.”  The source of the recent attack problem goes back to the original implementation of the bitcoin protocol and software by Satoshi Nakamoto. “Satoshi left lots of good ideas in the source code and we have to block those off,” he told us. “There was a feature that Satoshi added and never used, and an attacker was able to exploit that a bit.”  The original source code for Bitcoin is full of such half-finished features. There was even the beginning of a rudimentary eBay-style bitcoin market buried in the original code, which the core development team walled off because it was never finished.  The network attack is not ongoing, said Garzik, adding that the patch solved the network vulnerability.  Andreas M. Antonopoulos  , a security and distributed systems expert in cryptocurrencies who runs bitcoin incubator RootEleven, argued that the fact most people didn't know about the event demonstrated the resilience of the network.  “Have you had any problems with your bitcoin transactions? Neither have I,"" he continued. “It’s a testament to the resilience and strength of the network that under a DDoS attack we haven’t seen that network go away.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/25/bitcoin-network-recovering-from-ddos-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5513ad1a908a47d6cc3665ddcea67b0075d7891f-600x349.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
