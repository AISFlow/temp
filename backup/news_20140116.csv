He urged Indonesians to be cautious when dealing with payments in general.  Ronald Waas, the deputy governor, said using bitcoin in Indonesia contravened rules set out by Bank Indonesia, information and electronic transactions laws and currency laws. Kontan's piece also noted that Indonesia's currency laws state only the rupiah is legal tender.  ""Using bitcoin for payments breaks these laws,"" Ronald was quoted as saying.  The Kontan piece also noted that Ronald strongly urged Indonesians not to use bitcoin as a mode of payment. Bitcoin is risky because the security of transactions using the digital currency is not guaranteed, the report continued.  On a positive note, Ronald admitted that Bank Indonesia did not have detailed policies in place to govern bitcoin and did not have any specific rule to bar bitcoin's use as a mode of payment. Ronald also disclosed that the central bank had started working with the Ministry of Communications and Information to study the use of cryptocurrency in Indonesia.  Kontan is a respected business and economics news brand in Indonesia. It is published as a daily newspaper and a weekly journal. It is owned by Kompas Gramedia Group, the country's largest media conglomerate. The daily paper had an expected circulation of 75,000 when it launched in 2009.  Indonesia and bitcoin  Bitcoin has had a slow start in Indonesia. A number of exchanges are on the scene there, but some are still in development and none offer market-based prices. The latest exchange, Bitcoin.co.id, for example, offers fixed prices for BTC in exchange for rupiah. At the time of publication, 1 BTC was selling for 10.74 million rupiah ($886.20) on the exchange.  According to Bitcoin.co.id founder Oscar Darmawan, the nascent exchange had a trading volume of just 5 BTC a day when CoinDesk interviewed him at the end of Dec.  Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country, with nearly 240 million people. One of the opportunities for Indonesian bitcoin services providers is in facilitating small amounts of international remittances among a large migrant worker population spread across Southeast Asia.

42376844,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecxn,1389908162,eBay UK to Allow Sale of Virtual Currency from 10th February,"eBay is launching a dedicated Virtual Currency category on eBay Classifieds in the UK on 10th February.  The Classified Ads category will allow for the sale of all types of digital currency, including bitcoin and litecoin, eBay representatives have confirmed.  eBay Classifieds, which lists posts throughout the site, serves as the site's answer to Craigslist. eBay provides the free platform for local buyers and sellers to connect, but does not participate in the transactions.  Ryan Moore, Manager of Business Communications at eBay, said:    ""To promote a trustworthy marketplace and ensure compliance with applicable regulations, eBay is currently updating its Currency Policy. The updated policy will clarify that listings for Bitcoin and other similar virtual currencies must be listed in the Virtual Currency Category in the Classified Ad format.      The Virtual Currency category is expected to be available on the UK site on February 10th.""    A Reddit post earlier today sparked rumours of the change in policy. The post included an email from eBay stating that the company does not currently permit listings of digital currencies, but that this will soon change.  The email  reads:    ""Please know that per our recent policy update, Virtual Currency (i.e. Bitcoin and Litecoin), whether digitally or physically delivered, cannot be listed in Auction-style or Buy-It-Now listing formats. eBay is opening a Virtual Currency category to allow the sale of virtual currency in Classified Ads format on February 10, 2014.      We request that you do not list these items until that date. Please be informed that repeated breach of the policy may further jeopardize your account status. To avoid any inconvenience in future, we'd appreciated it if you go through our help pages or contact us before listing any such items.""    At press time, the policy change only applies to eBay's UK site. An eBay customer service representative said: ""Our policies are different for different country sites, so to know more about other countries, you need to contact the respective eBay sites.""  In December, an eBay user found a loophole that enabled him to sell digital currency via the site. He confirmed via customer service employees from eBay that virtual currencies could be sold on the platform, provided they are housed in physical items (like USB sticks or hard drives).  Pro-bitcoin  Both eBay president John Donahoe and David Marcus, president of eBay-owned PayPal, have shared their positive views on bitcoin in recent months, with Donahoe stating that he believes digital currency is going to be a “very powerful thing” in the future.  Marcus has been much more vocal in his support of bitcoin, labelling digital currency ""truly fascinating"" in one interview and even going as far as to call it the future of money in another.  This week, Marcus pledged his support to bitcoin on Twitter, stating that those at PayPal are ""believers in BTC"".    To clarify: we have no policies against using PayPal to sell Bitcoin mining rigs. We don't support any currency txn whether fiat or BTC...      — David Marcus (@davidmarcus) January 13, 2014      ...for a host of regulatory issues. But we treat BTC and any FX txn the same way. We're believers in BTC though.      — David Marcus (@davidmarcus) January 13, 2014    A small step  While today's development isn't quite the eBay-accepts-bitcoin-payments announcement that digital currency enthusiasts have been seeking, it should not be overlooked. The company has shown it is certainly not anti-bitcoin, and that it is prepared to adjust its policies to accommodate the fledgling currency and its alternatives.  The firm's bosses have made it clear they are interested in virtual currency and they are sure to be watching closely as other large online retailers start to accept it as a form of payment.  Overstock – a company with revenue of $1.1bn for 2012 – started accepting bitcoin last week, using California-based online wallet and payment processing firm Coinbase to handle its transactions. The company subsequently enjoyed a huge surge in sales, as CEO Patrick Byrne revealed on Twitter.    #Bitcoin's first full day on @overstock.com was a huge success: 840 orders, $130,000 in sales. Almost all new customers. #stunned      — Patrick M. Byrne (@OverstockCEO) January 10, 2014    Byrne said in a recent interview with CNN International that he is certain other retail giants will follow his company's lead and start accepting bitcoin payments soon.  ""This forces the hand of Amazon and some other big players. They have to follow suit. You will see them follow suit, I’ll be stunned if you don’t, because they can’t just cede that part of the market to us, if we’re the only main, large retail site taking bitcoin. Either they have to start taking it, or they’re just giving away a piece of the market,” he said.  Whether eBay will start to accept bitcoin is unclear, but what is certain is that, with a global customer base of 233 million and revenue of $14.07bn in 2012, doing so would give digital currency a huge mainstream boost.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/16/ebay-uk-to-allow-sale-of-virtual-currency-from-10th-february,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0276b20dba2a99b9a1b562aebf71ca1bc827aaf1-1000x654.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376839,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecwX,1389895251,Will UK Tax Authority HMRC Reclassify Bitcoin as 'Private Currency'?,"A reclassification of bitcoin by the United Kingdom's tax authority would put the nation in line with more liberal bitcoin tax rules initiated by Singapore, a professional services firm has claimed.  Richard Asquith, head of tax at TMF Global, said the UK's tax authority HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is most likely to reclassify bitcoin as a 'private currency'. This would significantly reduce the tax liability compared to its current classification as a 'tradable voucher’.  If HMRC classifies bitcoin as private money, then bitcoin holders would not be liable for capital gains tax. Value-added tax is still charged, but only on fees incurred by trading on an exchange, Asquith said.  ""The move would ... eliminate the heavy [capital gains] tax uncertainties and leave a reduced VAT liability. This would give the UK bitcoin industry a significant competitive advantage.""  Singapore and Germany  According to Asquith, such a reclassification of bitcoin by HMRC would match Singapore's tax authority and measures already adopted in Germany. In addition, it would bring the regulatory treatment of bitcoin closer to that of other 'psuedo-currencies' like gold.  ""[Reclassifying bitcoin] means that it would become much more like gold, which is VAT exempt. Gold is treated like money but it's not a currency; it's a pseudo currency.""  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) outlined its position on the cryptocurrency this month.  Notably, no capital gains tax would be levied (assets that are not property are not liable for capital gains tax in Singapore anyway); income tax would be charged based on fees earned by a company from trading in bitcoin; sales tax is generally charged on an exchange's commission fees.  Additionally, the Singapore position doesn't mention the term 'private money', and it has explicitly stated that bitcoin is not a form of currency.  In Germany, regulatory authorities view bitcoin as 'private money' or a 'unit of account'. Bitcoin transactions are exempt from capital gains tax after a year.  Assets like stocks and bonds are subject to a 25% capital gains tax and a state-dependent church tax. Bitcoin mining in Germany, however, is subject to income tax. Germany authorities haven't clarified whether a full value-added tax liability applies to bitcoin transactions, Asquith noted.  Bitcoin taxed as vouchers  While Germany and Singapore offer relatively liberal approaches to bitcoin taxation, there are more onerous alternatives, according to Asquith.  The current HMRC treatment of bitcoin as a voucher, for example, results in a heavy sales tax burden of 20%., and in some cases, double-taxation.  The most liberal tax treatment of bitcoin would be if HMRC classified the cryptocurrency a ""full currency"", according to Asquith. Currency transactions are exempt of sales tax.  But there's no chance of that happening, in Asquith's view: ""This is unlikely ever to be applied, as it would give bitcoin the status of a national currency.""  HMRC reclassification  There are rumblings that HMRC may move to reclassify bitcoin officially soon. According to Asquith, HMRC officials have told TMF Group executives that a reclassification could come as early as February.  Tom Robinson, co-founder of bitcoin insurance firm Elliptic Vault, who has met with HMRC to discuss taxation issues in the past, said he knows of at least one individual who has been informed by the tax authority that it has withdrawn its previous advice that bitcoins are vouchers, upon inquiry.  HM Revenue and Customs' official stand is that it is continuing to meet with individuals and companies dealing in bitcoin.  When asked to comment on whether HMRC will finalise its position on bitcoin and VAT next month, a spokesperson replied:  “There is a VAT exemption for currency transactions but the currency in question must be legal tender. We have held constructive meetings with stakeholders, but this is a complex issue, and we will continue to listen to arguments for alternative VAT treatments under existing VAT law.”  Richard Asquith has said that his earlier comment on double taxation was inaccurate. The article has been updated to reflect that.

42376827,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecjx,1389891604,Sacramento Kings Become First NBA Team to Accept Bitcoin,"The Sacramento Kings NBA franchise has officially announced plans to accept bitcoin for products including tickets, jerseys, hot dogs and beer, beginning 1st March. The team says it will accept the currency online and at the Sleep Train Arena, its home stadium.      Georgia-based payment service provider BitPay revealed that it will process the team's transactions, adding to its network of 10,000+ bitcoin-accepting merchants. Vivek Ranadivé, owner of the Sacramento Kings, said:      ""We are maniacally focused on creating the most seamless experience for our fans in all facets. With BitPay, we are able to implement a technology that allows our fans to make Kings-related purchases without physically reaching into their wallets.""              This statement was echoed by Tony Gallippi, BitPay's co-founder and CEO, who said: ""The Kings marketing team came to CES last week and were very curious about bitcoin.""      ""For several years BitPay has been investing in events like CES to introduce people to the amazing technology that is bitcoin. We are thrilled that the Kings could implement bitcoin so quickly,"" he added.      The announcement quickly reverberated through the financial world, with The Wall Street Journal calling it ""an important step in the virtual currency's bid to achieve mainstream acceptance.""    Tipping point    In an interview with the media outlet, Ranadivé, a native of Mumbai, India, was outspoken about his support for bitcoin and its ability to enable spending.      ""The way I saw it, bitcoin had reached a tipping point where it had crossed from being a curiosity to a becoming a legitimate form of doing commerce.""              The 56-year-old CEO and founder of TIBCO Software said he expects other NBA franchises to follow his lead, and detailed how bitcoin acceptance is part of a larger plan that seeks to grow his team's global fan base through the use of technology. Sacramento Kings coaches have recently begun to use Google Glass to observe games.      Ranadivé said the franchise does not plan to exchange the bitcoins it receives for fiat currency. Rather, he said he believes the currency's recent volatility will eventually dissipate and that bitcoin transactions and trading will become more common with time.    Silicon Valley and beyond    Sacramento, with its close proximity to bitcoin-friendly Silicon Valley, may be the right target area for such a test – as other markets may not be able to rely on a similarly large bitcoin customer base.      While the Kings are the first major US sports franchise to accept bitcoin, this isn't the first time that the bitcoin and athletic worlds have crossed.      In December, one sports fan received $20,000 simply for waving a bitcoin sign on national cable network ESPN, demonstrating the spending power of bitcoin-supporting sports fans.      Additionally, other sports teams are experimenting more broadly with mobile payments at stadiums. MasterCard has hinted at plans to test in-stadium mobile payment apps, while the Atlanta Falcons partnered with NCR on a similar initiative back in September.

42376833,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecoz,1389888030,Bitcoin Developer Mike Hearn and Amex VP Michael Barrett Join Circle Team,"Michael Barrett, vice president of security at American Express; and Mike Hearn, a lead bitcoin software developer, have officially joined the advisory board of digital currency company Circle Internet Financial.      Barrett and Hearn are the first appointments to the Boston-based company's advisory board.      ""We're gearing up for having our products and services in the market, and having the additional leadership necessary to be successful is really helpful,"" Circle founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire told CoinDesk in an interview. ""My philosophy is to surround myself and surround my leadership team with the best and brightest within certain disciplines.""      Circle said Barrett will assist the company as it develops information security best practices, but was less clear in the release about Hearn and his future involvement in the project. Notably, it did cite Hearn's work on the use of bitcoin for managing contracts and securitized assets.      Allaire declined to specify whether such mentions were indicative of specific future company plans, but did speak more broadly about how Hearn will provide this type of big-picture thinking to Circle.      ""Hearing Mike think about and talk about some of these ideas was really inspiring,"" Allaire said. ""We like that thinking. We're big fans of seeing the bitcoin software start to be applied in other use cases, and having a thought leader around those issues sharing ideas with us is great.""      Allaire went on to compare Hearn to a ""strategic consultant"" that will help Circle think about how it can expand its businesses in different areas. Furthermore, Hearn told to CoinDesk that his role on the board will be to help the company brainstorm new ideas, share his opinions and offer advice.      The announcement also confirmed December rumors that M. Michele Burns, a former Cisco, Goldman Sachs, Orbitz and Walmart Stores board member, has joined Circle's board of directors. Allaire cited timing as the reason for the delay, saying that the holidays played a factor, as did the company's desire to include Hearn and Barrett in this news.      Still, Allaire was enthusiastic about the Burns announcement.      ""As a company that aspires to build a global consumer-facing financial services company... it helps to have someone like [M.] Michelle Burns to help us think about what does a financial operation of a global consumer-facing financial company need to look like,"" Allaire said.              Allaire went on to suggest that Burns could help the company approach customer acquisition, its balance sheet and audit controls with more precision. He noted Circle is currently looking to expand its advisory board, suggesting more names could be added to the body in the future.      Circle received the second most VC funding of any bitcoin startup in 2013, trailing only Coinbase with $9 million in investment from Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners.    The startup, which launched in October, aims to drive mainstream bitcoin and digital currency adoption through consumer- and merchant-facing payment services.

The high school junior aspires to go to college in Colorado with his brother, and says he will dedicate 1 BTC to his shopping list in preparation for the big move. But, though his focus is on the future, Wright says the increased notoriety is having implications at his high school. He noted that he's already been approached by several casual acquaintances about the prize.      Since the price of bitcoin hit $1,000 USD, Wright says he has become involved in cryptocurrency, but primarily in dogecoin due to its low mining difficulty.

42425272,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvrfh,1389875639,Belgian Regulators Issue Joint Bitcoin Warning,"The National Bank of Belgium (NBB) and the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) have issued a joint statement, warning investors about the pitfalls of investing in digital currencies such as bitcoin and litecoin.  The statement points out that digital currencies are becoming relatively popular and attracting media attention, but they are also drawing in speculators looking to make a quick buck on bitcoin volatility.  Risks compounded by lack of regulation  The NBB and the FSMA stress that digital currencies are not issued by a central bank or a licensed issuer of electronic money. Therefore there is no regulation, supervision or oversight on virtual money, the regulators warn. The same, of course, applies to the issuers of virtual money, digital wallets and exchanges.  The statement outlines some examples of “serious risks attached to virtual money” such as:  The internet environment is open to various risks, including security breaches and attacks that could allow hackers to gain control of digital wallets.  The reliability of Internet-based systems has not been assessed by the regulators and there is a risk of fraud.  Fluctuations in the exchange rate can lead to substantial financial losses. There is no authority or government supervision over the exchange rate. There is no guarantee that virtual money can be exchanged at any time for the original value.  Furthermore, since digital currencies are not legal tender, no-one can be obliged to accept them. Unlike money held in savings accounts, digital currency deposits are not covered by government guarantees.  Belgian Bitcoin Association responds  In response, the Belgian Bitcoin Association issued a statement, saying that the latest warning issued by the NBB and FSMA is very similar to warnings issued by government agencies in other European countries.  “The Belgian Bitcoin Association believes that the current stance of the Belgian National Bank and the Financial Services and Markets Authority means that the bitcoin ecosystem is allowed to develop further in Belgium, which is very encouraging news for individuals and businesses,” the association told CoinDesk, adding:  “Belgium appears to be leading the way in Europe, demonstrating that larger businesses can integrate bitcoin into their payment methods with ease, as recently demonstrated by mobile telephone operator Mobile Vikings.”  The association also points out that smaller businesses and individuals now finally have some regulatory clarity, allowing them to experience bitcoin for themselves.  Prior to the regulatory warning, the Belgian Bitcoin Association held an informal meeting with the Belgian National Bank, attended by Belgian Bitcoin Association legal counsel Thomas Spaas and the association’s founding director and Secretary Chris D’Costa.  D’Costa said the meeting took place last week and the issues raised by the regulators in their latest statement are in line with what the Belgian Bitcoin Association was told to expect at the meeting.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/16/belgian-regulators-issue-joint-bitcoin-warning,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3ed77139e468f8cbf6faf226bca3023f107feb5-1000x670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425281,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvrzh,1389871839,'Heated' Bitcoin Debate Flares at Asian Financial Forum,"The chief executive of Octopus, a Hong Kong-based contactless smart card provider, has suggested the company hasn't ruled out accepting bitcoin, The Standard reported yesterday.    ""We don't exclude the possibility that one day our customers are entitled to use bitcoin to add value to their Octopus card,"" said CEO Sunny Cheung Yiu-Tong.      The comment was reportedly issued during a ""heated debate"" between Cheung and Hong Kong Monetary Authority official Esmond Lee Kin-Ying at a panel discussion on financial service innovation at the Asian Financial Forum on 14th January. The conference sought to bring together Asia's financial leaders to discuss regional economic matters, and was held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.    Virtual commodity?    At the event, Cheung suggested that he expects bitcoin's user base to expand as the currency wins acceptance with online merchants. Lee countered, saying that bitcoin cannot yet be classified as a virtual currency, preferring instead to label it a ""virtual commodity.""      ""Bitcoin fails to meet two preconditions as a virtual currency: consensus on its par value and confidence in the issuers.""            Lee cast doubt on Cheung's statements that suggested more online merchants would seek to do business in the currency. In particular, Lee asserted that real estate developers, automobile manufacturers and other real-world businesses were unlikely to use bitcoin.    This statement comes just a few weeks after a UK car classifieds site indicated it would list prices in bitcoin, and one month after a Lamborghini dealership accepted bitcoins for payment, suggesting growing interest in digital currency within the auto industry.      Panelist Zennon Kapron, founder of financial industry consulting firm Kapronasia, also weighed in on the discussion, advocating for a ""rational"" approach to bitcoin use across all economic sectors.    Regulation in Asia    This open dialogue is notable at a time when many Asian markets like China and India are enacting or debating restrictions on virtual currencies like bitcoin and litecoin.      Public comments from the bitcoin meetup group Bitcoin HK suggest that this debate may not have been the only time bitcoin was discussed at the convention. The group had noted its intent to use the forum as a way to inspire dialogue about emerging virtual currencies in public posts.    Despite Cheung's seeming support for bitcoin, it is unlikely that Octopus' decision to formally accept the currency would come under his leadership.  Cheung is currently the outgoing CEO of Octopus Cards Limited, the organization that oversees the Octopus smart card network. Last August, he announced his intention to retirehttp://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/2013/en/20130815.html in January 2014.

42425271,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvrdh,1389866410,Are Stealth Addresses the Secret to Bitcoin Privacy?,"""So far, [bitcoin users have] had to pick between simplicity and privacy,"" bitcoin core developer Mike Hearn told CoinDesk. ""Stealth addresses let us have our cake and eat it.""      Hearn's reaction echoes others who have seen the block chain improvements proposed in a new paper by noted bitcoin developer Peter Todd, based on input from: Gregory Maxwell, Adam Back and Amir Taaki.      Released via SourceForge on 6th January, the paper details the creation of a stealth address: a new type of bitcoin address that is being heralded as ""revolutionary” for its ability to allow more anonymous payments on the block chain. As the report reads:      ""[The stealth address would] allow payees to publish a single, fixed address that payors can [use to] send funds efficiently, privately, reliably and non-interactively.""            Addressing reuse    The primary benefit, the paper says, is that payors would not learn of other payments made to stealth addresses, while third-parties would not glean any information from the transaction at all.      As such, the paper is fast gaining the attention of developers for its perceived potential to curb the privacy problems related to address reuse. Namely, that it is currently possible for an attacker to learn the outputs owned by a wallet address and use this information to link payments together.      However innovative, report author Peter Todd sees the paper in less grandiose terms – stressing that this is just a small improvement that will make bitcoin better, he said:      ""This just makes it more convenient for regular users to do the right thing and maintain their own privacies. This is about making [bitcoin privacy] easier for normal people.""              Furthermore, Todd distanced the associations between this update and the privacy-focused virtual currency Zerocoin.      ""It probably should have done ages ago, but sometimes the pieces don't fall together and people don't realize the implications of things,"" Todd told CoinDesk.    Elliptic curves    Stealth addresses rely on the Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithm, originally used by Bitcointalk.org forum member ByteCoin, to generate an anonymous key agreement between payors and payees, enabling them to share a ""secret"" that can be used for them to divide funds.      A step-by-step diagram posted to imgur.com illusrates how Stealth addresses work in four steps:    The payee publishes a public key 'Q' and a corresponding private key 'd'.  The payer generates a key pair where the private key = 'e' public key of 'P' where 'P' is the transaction.  The payer calculates 'S=eQ', where 'S' is a shared secret between the two parties. The payee calculates 'S=dP' to get 'S'.  With the secret shared, either side can calculate an offset to 'Q', which acts as the address. The payee then checks the transaction, and if the address matches, spends the funds.    Todd downplayed concerns that the extra coding would add complexity to the block chain, calling it a ""fairly simply process"" that ""only needs a single piece of data"".      ""You're still only looking at single transactions in isolation,"" Todd said.      Going forward, Todd says he'll work with collaborators Gregory Maxwell and Adam Back to come to a reasonable specification for a bitcoin improvement protocol (BIP). If a consensus can be determined, Todd says clients will then implement the upgrade. However, early indications are promising.      ""Peer review is still ongoing but there hasn't been any negative feedback, so this could really be something big,"" Reddit user Tharlam indicated.

42425274,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvrhh,1389860559,Chinese Central Bank Official: We Don't Want to Suppress Bitcoin,"A representative from the People's Bank of China claimed in a press conference yesterday his institution is not trying to prevent bitcoin use, just clarify its status, according to a report from BitcoinExaminer.  Questioned about the central bank's recent actions limiting bitcoin use in China, its chief of the survey and statistics department Sheng Song Cheng answered:  ""We don’t want to suppress or discriminate against bitcoin, we are simply saying it is not a currency.""  Sheng stressed that bitcoin's status in China was that of a ""virtual good"", and that the bank's position was in line with other countries' stances.  Recent moves  The claim might seem unusual on the surface, given that the Chinese authorities have forbidden both financial institutions and third-party payment processors from accessing bitcoin exchanges in recent months. Such moves seem clearly aimed at removing bitcoin from mainstream use and keeping it available only to determined enthusiasts.  Sheng is also not known to be a digital currency fan. He was quoted in an English translation of a previous Chinese media report as saying: ""Bitcoin is merely a utopia for technology supremacists and absolute liberalists.""  The ever-optimistic bitcoin community appears to be taking the news as a positive sign, though, if posts on Reddit are a guide. China has not gone any further than stopping the institutions it mentioned specifically, allowing bitcoin exchanges to continue their business and even find alternate methods for their customers to move their official national currency in and out of the system.  Preventing financial institutions from becoming involved in bitcoin exchange could be a genuinely prudent measure if the People's Bank thought price volatility presented a risk to the country's financial stability.  Or is the central bank simply trying to maintain an illusion of choice while guiding investors' actions? Blocking third-party payment processors from exchanges as well as banks could be a sign.  International stance  Even other government-related agencies around the world, while seeming to remain open to greater bitcoin acceptance, choose to highlight its negative points in public statements as much as possible. A series of central bank statements around the end of 2013 and first week of this year made very similar warnings about lack of currency status, investment risk, and money laundering.  Recent updates from China have not caused much movement in the bitcoin price there. As of the time of writing, 1 BTC was trading for 5,147.49 CNY ($850.35) on BTC China and 5,137.4 CNY ($848.68) on Huobi.com.

42425277,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvrnh,1389849725,Canadian Realtor Accepts Bitcoin Deposits for Residential Properties,"Yet another real estate firm has begun accepting bitcoin downpayments on its property, this time in British Columbia, Canada.  Abbotsford-based Quantum Properties began accepting bitcoin deposits on Wednesday for properties it sells in the area. The firm, formed in 2000, builds multi-family residential and commercial/retail buildings.  ""For accepting deposits, bitcoin payments actually works very fast for us. We can be assured of the deposit within an hour while we finish our customer’s paperwork,"" said president and CEO Diane Delves, who added that traditional fiat deposits took a few days to clear. ""Bitcoin also carries no to very low transaction fees which is a nice bonus.""  The firm is bucking what seems to be a growing trend among merchants such as Overstock.com to immediately convert bitcoin back to fiat currency. Its costs are in Canadian dollars, so the firm will need to convert most of the coins to dollars in order to cover them, said Delves. ""However, we do believe in the future of bitcoin and plan to hold some as an investment.""  Quantum will price its deposits based on the Canadian dollar equivalent at the time. Delves said:  ""We think any fluctuations will eventually even out on our transactions so we’re not too worried about the currency exchange rate risk in the short-term.""  She joins a growing number of people offering real estate priced – at least partly – in bitcoin. In August, Saskatoon realtor Paul Chavady announced he would take bitcoin downpayments.  Greater public awareness around bitcoin seems to have ignited realtors in the last month, though. In December, The largest Canadian real estate offering yet, a $1m acreage in the prairie province of Alberta, went on the market with a bitcoin price tag.  Manhattan, NY-based realtor Bond New York also took the plunge, offering bitcoin pricing on residential properties there. Also, Julian Tosh, a consultant and owner of bitcoinsinvegas.com, offered his $7.85m Vegas mansion in the digital currency a few weeks ago.  Quantum would be focusing on residential projects for its bitcoin deposits, Delves said. ""As a business, we need to adapt quickly to the future and we believe there is a future for Bitcoin as a payment transaction service.""  The 156-unit Mahogany at Mill Lake project in Abbotsford is the firm's largest project on sale at the moment, with prices from $259,900. Sales launched about a year ago, and it still has 78 units to sell.
