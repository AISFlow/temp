42382688,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9seBz,1568930419,Game Maker Electronic Arts Trolls Crypto Twitter,"A brand account bested crypto Twitter at its own game today, trolling the space with misleading instructions to go all-in on cryptocurrency.  Earlier this afternoon, the Electronic Arts twitter account tweeted out “invest in Crypto,"" seemingly unprompted. The tweet had over 10,000 favorites and 4,000 retweets and many Twitter users suggested the account had been hacked.    invest in Crypto.        — Electronic Arts (@EA) September 19, 2019      Known for sports action games like Madden and FIFA, the tweet was actually a marketing stunt aimed at introducing a new character in its game, Apex Legends Season 3: Meltdown! coming out this October. The new character is named ""Crypto"" – in this case referring to traditional cryptography and not Satoshi's white paper.  In an apparent conversation with itself, the @EAAccess account asked back, “Brother, why do you do this?

42382698,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9seNJ,1568930411,"SEC Chair, Commissioners to Talk Crypto at Congress Hearing Next Week","The U.S. House Financial Services Committee plans to question the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about cryptocurrencies and Facebook's Libra project next week, among a host of other topics.  According to a calendar notice on the House of Representatives' website, the committee will hold a one-panel hearing with SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, as well as Commissioners Robert Jackson, Elad Roisman, Allison Lee and ""Crypto Mom"" Hester Pierce on Sept. 24 in the Rayburn House Office Building.  The hearing  will cover the SEC's actions around the cryptocurrency space, as well as private markets vs. public markets; public company disclosures; enforcement; and fiduciary responsibilities.  While the notice does not specify which areas the committee might focus on, it does note that the SEC published its analysis of whether a token is an investment contract using the three prongs of the Howey test, and it includes a general definition of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  ""Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are a type of investment company, which can be redeemed by the fund like mutual funds, but also allow investors to trade throughout the day on an exchange at market prices,"" the notice reads, adding:  ""If an asset is an investment company and not exempt from registration, it must comply with regulations designed to minimize conflicts of interest, including regular disclosure of their financial condition and investment policies to investors.""  The SEC is currently reviewing two bitcoin ETF proposals, filed by Bitwise Asset Management and Wilshire Phoenix (a third ETF proposal by VanEck and SolidX was withdrawn earlier this week).  Libra concerns  The notice also addresses Facebook's Libra crypto project, which was first announced in June 2019. Libra, as envisioned, would act as a stablecoin backed by a basket of global currencies, which currently includes the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound and Singapore dollar.  The cryptocurrency will be overseen by a governing council of 100 members, of which 28 have already signed tentative agreements to join (it is worth noting that Facebook and its subsidiary Calibra are two of the members). The Libra Association will be based in Geneva, Switzerland, though Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has expressed unease with this plan.  Thursday's notice hints at possible securities implications for Libra's companion token, which would be distributed to members of the association, writing:  ""The Libra Investment Token could amount to a security since it is intended to be sold to investors to fund startup costs and would provide them with dividends. The Libra token itself may also be a security, but Facebook does not intend to pay dividends and it is unclear if investors would have a 'reasonable expectation of profits.' However, the offer of Libra could be integrated into the offering of the Libra Investment Token, thereby deeming both securities.""  ""Like ETFs, Libra would be redeemable by certain authorized resellers and bought and sold in the open market,"" the notice concluded.  The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing specifically about Libra in July, a day after the Senate Banking Committee held its own. At the time, lawmakers questioned Facebook blockchain lead and Calibra CEO David Marcus about how the project would operate and whether it would impact the U.S. or global economies, among other areas of concern.

42382696,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9seKn,1568921408,"Loom Network Is Bringing DeFi to Tron, Binance Chains","MakerDAO’s dai stablecoin will be implemented on the tron and binance chains in the near future through Loom Network, a Layer 2 scaling solution for the ethereum blockchain, according to a company blog posting today.  An ERC-20 token, dai is part of the ethereum blockchain. As the largest DeFi token with over $337 million locked away in contracts according to DeFi Pulse, Loom believes moving dai onto other chains will help grow the token.  Speaking with CoinDesk, Loom Network CEO and co-founder Matthew Campbell said interoperability with other chains has been a key vision for the Network.  ""With interchain asset transfers, we open up some completely new possibilities for things like multichain DeFi,"" Campbell said. ""As Maker is the clear leader in the space, it made perfect sense to team up and make multichain dai a reality. This will be a massive step forward in bringing dai to even more users and developers, and proving out what’s possible with cross-chain assets,"" he continued.  Dai will first join the tron blockchain following a testing period. The token will join stablecoin tether on the tron network, which is also hosted on the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains. Loom believes the addition of dai to tron could spur the development of other DeFi protocols on that protocol.  Binance Chain will also have dai ported over through Loom, although the timing was not disclosed. Other blockchains Loom plans to build dai into have not been disclosed either.  Describing the tech, Loom says their network will operate as a Layer 1 ‘transit hub,’ shuffling funds between different protocols such as etherum, tron, or binance. Transfers between chains will be secured through multi-signature validations on the Loom Network which require three-quarters plus one of all Loom validators before transactions can be signed off.  “The idea is that one day soon, a user can pay for a product using dai regardless of what app, wallet, or chain they are using,” the company finished.  After publication, a spokesperson from the Maker Foundation told CoinDesk dai and the Loom Network are a natural pairing for expanding the DeFi ecosystem. ""[Through interoperability] more people and projects can now leverage the stable, secure and trustless nature of dai for their DeFi projects and crypto portfolios,"" Maker said.

42382695,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9seJX,1568918718,Iranian Government Proposes Annual License for Bitcoin and Crypto Miners,"CoinDesk has acquired documents detailing a draft proposal for new cryptocurrency mining regulations in Iran, which sources in Tehran say is well on its way toward official approval.  Based on the translated proposal from the Cabinet of Iran, licensed and registered cryptocurrency miners will be required to submit information such as their list of business activities, the predicted value of their investments, current employment status, rental agreements for the space itself, the value of their mining equipment and the duration of the mining project. The license will need to be renewed every year.  Stepping back, the Iranian mining industry has grown dramatically over the past two years, thanks in part to state-subsidized electricity. For example, just one Persian Telegram group for local miners has 3,424 members. Based on a survey of more than 1,600 Iranian crypto users by the market analytics firm Gate Trade, 35 percent of respondents earned income through mining and 70 percent were interested in learning more about local mining businesses. One anonymous source in Tehran told CoinDesk that most miners he knows are “under the radar” and import equipment through the black market, without paying taxes.  As such, the Central Bank of Iran finally recognized the grassroots industry and promised a lawful licensing procedure in July 2019. This pending proposal was approved by Reza Rahmani, Iran’s Minister of Industry, Mine and Trade. The Iranian mining licenses would only apply to miners with equipment that requires 30 kilowatts, which might exclude homemade mining equipment or small operations.  However, another source in Tehran, an avid bitcoiner, told CoinDesk he supports this move because it could create the foundations for a sustainable mining industry in the country. For example, if too many miners in a single district apply, the authorities could encourage miners to distribute their operations across the region.  “It’s obvious that the power industry here in Iran, it’s not a private business, it’s from the government,” the second anonymous source said. “They need to figure out how to balance mining [operations] so that they wouldn’t harm the power grid. If there’s a constant, a continuous consumption of electricity you can also make new power plants or assign power plants to this.”  On the other hand, he still doesn’t believe this legislation will completely curtail the flood of hobbyist miners joining the bitcoin community.  “There will be a lot of underground mining operations,” he said. “I predict that this will happen, that the power grid will take a hit from the abundance of people who will do mining in their homes.”  A third source in Tehran told CoinDesk he expects Iran to become one of the world’s biggest players in the bitcoin mining sector over the next year.

42382693,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9seH1,1568917849,China's Crypto Czar: Facebook-Led Libra 'Might Be Unstoppable’,"China’s cryptocurrency czar believes that while the world powers do not welcome Facebook’s Libra, the stablecoin’s advance might now be unstoppable.  A few days before Changchuan Mu, the new director of China’s Research Institute on Digital Currency, officially assumed his role on Sept. 6, an online education platform released six lectures by the crypto chief.  In the series, Mu answers a range of crypto questions, from Libra’s technical features, to its potential integration with the international currency system, while touting the advantages of China’s own digital currency compared to Libra.  “No countries welcome Libra, but it might be unstoppable anyways,” Mu said in the third lecture of the series. “It is very unlikely that one can totally stop people from buying Libra despite rigorous regulations.”  Mu explained that the most a central bank could do to prevent Libra from entering a country would be to ask all their payment institutions and commercial banks not to process any transactions related to Libra.  However, there are still a few back channels through which users could circumvent the ban to purchase Libra, he said, citing underground Bitcoin trading in China as an example of how it could work.  Although China’s exchanges have blocked bitcoin transactions and payment institutions and commercial banks are prohibited from processing any bitcoin transactions, there are still some agencies that use virtual private networks (VPNs) to buy bitcoin from foreign exchanges, according to Mu.  The situation applies to Libra as well. “Even if Facebook is blocked in China, people will use indirect ways to purchase it from abroad once Libra comes out,” Mu said.  But he thought that there was only one possibility to stop Libra: “If the U.S. bans Libra legally, then Libra will certainly be stopped.”  As long as the U.S. does not put a legal ban on Libra, and other central banks loosen regulations over time, it is highly likely that Libra will become a dominant international currency, Mu said.  There are a few extreme cases where a country fully embraces Libra, Mu said, noting Zimbabwe -- with rampant inflation -- announced last year that it welcomes any alternative currencies.  A Fight Over Monetary Sovereignty  If one of the foundations for monetary policy is that the central bank is able to control supply and demand of its local currency by adjusting the interest rate, Libra would be a destabilizing force, Mu argued.  Effective monetary policies are crucial for a country’s economy, Libra would chip away that power, he said.  “If we allow Libra come to the market, we would open the underground economic channels,” Mu said. “It will be hard for China to manage foreign currencies and the $50,000 capital outflow cap would be less effective,” Mu said.  Controlling capital flows and preventing money laundering were the “deeper reasons” behind the Chinese crackdown on initial coin offerings in 2017, he said. Mu said about 15% of international payments last year were encrypted assets, citing a survey from blockchain company Clovr, although CoinDesk was unable to locate that report.  Mu said Thailand and Vietnam would lose control over their monetary and interest rate policies because of their weak currencies, while Libra could also inflate local currency as people tend to buy cryptocurrency with local fiat, resulting in inflation and the devaluation of assets denominated by local currencies.  Repair The Roof Before A Rainy Day  Earlier this year, China announced plans to launch the DCEP -- the Digital Currency Electronic Payment -- as a domestic stablecoin rival in the Libra model.  While Mu pointed out that DCEP will not be a copy of Libra, the central bank has compared DCEP with Libra in its statements and in how the coin would be used by consumers.  China’s national digital currency plan would be fully-backed by the central government and pegged one-to-one to the Chinese renminbi.  “One of the goals for DCEP is to replace cash,” Mu said. Since the DCEP is not tied to a bank account, the currency can enable users to have anonymous transactions, which would give the same advantage as Libra in terms of digital payment.  While there is a possibility that Facebook could track you down if you use Libra, the same would be true for the DCEP, according to Mu.  “The new digital currency will spot certain behavioral patterns using big data and identify the users,” Mu said, noting the technology can “help the government crackdown on money laundering, tax evasion and financing terrorist groups.”  “We need to defend our monetary sovereignty and currency, repair the roof before a rainy day,” Mu said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/19/chinas-crypto-czar-facebook-led-libra-might-be-unstoppable,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42a7a5121d8674a3e486bd597b8218b9903310c0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382689,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9seAj,1568912407,Lightning Wallet Zap Launches in-App OTC Desk for Bitcoin Buyers,"Wallet developer Jack Mallers, the founder of Zap Solutions, wants to improve the Lightning Network’s user experience.  To achieve that goal, Zap is launching a dollar-denominated bitcoin buying feature inside its lightning-friendly mobile and desktop wallet. Zap is kicking off the feature with an invitation-only beta release in late September.  “We’ve architected the [wallet] codebase so that we can release a version that doesn't include know-your-customer information,” Mallers told CoinDesk. “The KYC stuff is only pulled in when you want to buy or sell bitcoin. You download [Zap], link it to your debit card. KYC is just email, name and address. Then buy bitcoin, sent to you via lightning, that’s almost instantly spendable.”  To be clear, this feature isn’t mandatory and anonymous users will still be able to connect the wallet to their own remote nodes via Tor. But for prospective buyers, Mallers managed to make this option without becoming an exchange by operating a backend over-the-counter desk that buys the bitcoin from exchanges on wallet users’ behalf and then places it directly to the users’ personal custody.  “Zap acts as a gateway, it can absorb the order and execute on any of the exchanges,” Mallers said, referring to both the system and open-source code. “If anyone comes up with a cooler wallet they should be able to follow this regulatory framework. ... It should be trivial to copy and paste what I did into their own wallet.”  Mallers said he is currently applying for a money transmitter license in each state and planning to go global in 2020. (As a first step, Zap Solutions registered as a money services business with the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on Sept. 19, according to a public filing.)  “Our licensing allows us to serve any user group between small consumer orders to large institutional orders,” he added.  Beyond the American market, a Palestinian bitcoin user in Ramallah, who asked to remain anonymous, told CoinDesk that he is currently translating Arabic tutorials for the wallet.  “The banking system is trash over here. You can’t open a bank account unless you already have a job,” the Palestinian Zap user said. “Also, if you deposit or receive more than $4,000, you get a call from the authorities asking you to explain why. I have a sister over in the U.S. and I want to send her $100 for the holidays but it costs $20 with MoneyGram.”  Like most Palestinian users, this Zap contributor can’t use traditional exchanges because such platforms don’t work with Palestinian banks. He said it’s hard to use decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, and grassroots networks because the West Bank’s bitcoin market liquidity is so limited that traders can charge high premiums.  “Zap and lightning will help us save on bitcoin fees,” he added, speaking about the wallet’s “huge” utility for Palestinians  Future growth  Future initiatives for Zap include efforts to expand functionality even further.  Mallers said that Zap is working with the payment processor BTCPay Server to eventually allow merchants indirectly to convert bitcoin payments to other currencies if they choose.  “One of the biggest issues with Lightning is there is nowhere to use it,” Mallers said. “Zap has many merchant partnerships in the pipeline that will be announced as we roll out.”  The anonymous Ramallah-based Zap user said that any online merchants could be a boon for Palestinian users.  “Every day I see people line up for someone with a credit card from Israeli banks to shop because most sites don’t accept Palestinian cards,” he said. “[With bitcoin] they don’t have to deal with Palestinian banks with bad customer service, and also can avoid censorship by the Israelis.”  Going global with merchant support will take time. Since the hassle of opening lightning channels is often a hurdle for bitcoin newcomers, the Zap support team will manage channels for now.  To accommodate that ambitious plan, Mallers is expanding his self-funded startup from a staff of five to roughly a dozen people by the end of 2019. Plus, Zap is partnering with industry incumbents like the financial services firm CMT Digital, in order to tackle both legal and technical hurdles.  CMT Digital CEO Colleen Sullivan told CoinDesk:  “CMT Digital and Zap are cooperating to determine the fiat on-ramps for the Zap wallet. We believe that making the purchase of bitcoin easily and instantly accessible directly through the Zap wallet will help accelerate growth of the Lightning Network. This will, in turn, help with scalability of the Bitcoin protocol by allowing for additional capabilities and use cases.”  Zap is hardly the only company that allows users to purchase bitcoin using the lighting network. For example, the lightning-centric exchange startup Sparkswap facilitates such purchases with self-custody via its desktop app.  Zap, however, does have a unique business model that doesn’t rely on transaction fees for retail users. In part, this is made possible by support from Mallers’ parents, Bill and Brooke, the legendary “Bitcoin Mom” who runs a bitcoin-friendly cannabis dispensary in Colorado. As such, Zap won’t need to prioritize transaction fees for retail users, or other standard monetization ploys, any time soon.  “As a family, we are extremely proud to bring the first regulated fiat-to-lightning ramps to bitcoin,” Mallers said.

Speaking at CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said investors are “sorely mistaken” if they think bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies undergo the same price discovery practices as products on top exchanges like the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange.  “We have to get to a place, in my view -- just speaking for myself -- we have to get to a place that we can be confident that trading is better regulated.”  Clayton said price reports do not indicate thorough price discovery, as he claims major exchanges perform for other financial products. Investor protections built into major exchanges, he continued, are needed in crypto markets before they can be added.  Clayton’s crypto message follows remarks made earlier this month concerning a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Clayton claimed there is “work left to be done,” although “progress is being made.”  The financial regulator is nearing deadlines for approving or rejecting bitcoin ETFs from Wilshire Pheonix and Bitwise Asset Management.  A third bitcoin ETF applications, Cboe BZX Exchange VanEck/SolidX bitcoin ETC, was withdrawn earlier this week as an October 18 deadline loomed and approval seemed unlikely.

42382684,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9se5h,1568898014,Bank of America Joins Marco Polo Blockchain Trade Network,"Bank of America has joined Marco Polo, a consortium working to bring efficiencies to international trade using blockchain technology.  Founded by startups R3 and TradeIX, Marco Polo is built on R3's Corda blockchain platform. The network aims to deliver real-time connectivity, greater visibility for trading relationships and lower barriers to accessing capital.  According to an announcement emailed to CoinDesk Thursday, the bank said that as a long-standing provider of trade and supply chain finance solutions, it is becoming a Marco Polo member firm in order to offer better services for clients.  Geoff Brady, head of global trade and supply chain finance in Global Transaction Services at Bank of America, said:  “Joining the Marco Polo Network supports our strategic objective of turning technology advances into trade solutions that address client needs. We look forward to exploring how the new technology can generate greater transparency for our clients throughout the transaction lifecycle, making traditionally paper-based, opaque processes easier and more efficient.”  With Bank of America now in the group, David E. Rutter, R3 CEO, said he hopes more U.S. banks will be encouraged to join Marco Polo.  Rutter continued:  “As the network continues to grow, so too does the growing number of use cases blockchain technology presents in transforming financial markets. Trade finance is one such area that is set to benefit the most from the promise of blockchain and the increased efficiencies it can bring.""  Earlier this month, Mastercard too joined the consortium, saying that its business-to-business global trade unit, Mastercard Track, will provide an access point to Marco Polo’s working capital finance platform.  In August, Marco Polo said it had taken another step toward launching a live product. The 25-plus member group indicated at the time that a successful pilot had allowed a third party in a trade to trigger a payment to a supplier in real-time at the moment the goods are on their way to their destination. That milestone came after the network's first live transactions in trials back in March.  Trade finance projects building with blockchain tech are rapidly increasing in number, thanks to the dangling carrot of increased efficiency and its resultant cost savings. There are already around 30 consortia in the space, including Voltron (also built on Corda), ethereum-based CargoX and Asia-focused eTrade Connect, which runs on Hyperledger Fabric.  As of last year, Bank of America had a $313.5 billion market cap, ranking it as the 13th largest company in the world, and the sixth largest public company in the U.S.  Bank of America image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/19/bank-of-america-joins-marco-polo-blockchain-trade-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afbb03d52dbe79d5ff0d5468442b019e45bdb03d-1300x831.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382682,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9se6x,1568896209,'Panda' Crypto Malware Group Has Nabbed $100K in Monero Since 2018,"A cybersecurity firm has identified a group behind a spate of cryptocurrency-mining malware attacks that have been targeting enterprises across the globe.  Said to have already scooped up almost $100,000 (at current prices) in the monero cryptocurrency via its malicious software packages, the group has been dubbed ""Panda,"" by the team that identified it last summer – the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group.  Talos said in a report on Tuesday that Panda's employs remote access tools (RATs) and crypto-mining malwareto exploit vulnerable web applications, and manages to access networks of companies internationally. Its use of RATs puts organizations at risk of the hacking group using their networks for crypto mining purposes or theft of information, according to Talos.  ""This is far from the most sophisticated actor we've ever seen, but it still has been one of the most active attackers we've seen in Cisco Talos threat trap data,"" the team said.  The group has proven adept at updating its tools as they are discovered, in something of an arms race with security researchers.  Talos indicates that Panda harnesses exploits previously employed by Shadow Brokers – a group notorious for publishing hacking tools stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency – and Mimikatz, open-source software that is able to steal passwords from computer memory.  Talos said it has identified ""successful"" and ""widespread"" malware campaigns associated with Panda after identifying the group in 2018. Since then Panda has upgraded its infrastructure, exploits and payloads.  The researchers said:  ""We believe Panda is a legitimate threat capable of spreading cryptocurrency miners that can use up valuable computing resources and slow down networks and systems. Talos confirmed that organizations in the banking, healthcare, transportation, telecommunications, IT services industries were affected in these campaigns.""  While the group may not be the most sophisticated, alos warned that ""system administrators and researchers should never underestimate the damage an actor can do with widely available tools such as Mimikatz.""  It calculated that Panda has mined around 1,215 monero (XMR) – worth $91,000 at press time – since it started operations.

42382699,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sePp,1568891038,Bitcoin Price Dips to $9.6K as Bear Cross Looms,"View  BTC quickly fell to $9,600 this morning, bolstering the bearish setup on the 4-hour and daily charts. A deeper drop to key support at $9,454 may now be in the offing.  A UTC close below $9,450 would confirm a downside break of a three-month-long contracting triangle and expose the 200-day moving average (MA) support lined up near $8,100.  A move above $10,458 is needed to negate the immediate bearish case. A UTC close above $10,958 would confirm a bullish triangle breakout.  The 50- and 100-day moving averages are about to produce a bearish crossover, a lagging indicator known to trap sellers on the wrong side of the market.      Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to an 18-day low today, as a key indicator threatens to turn bearish for the first time in a year.  The top cryptocurrency fell by $500 in 10 minutes just after 03:00 UTC to hit a low of $9,600 on Bitstamp. That level was last seen on Sept. 1.  The drop was expected as BTC was on slippery ground following last week's failed breakout. Volatility also fell to multi-month lows on Wednesday, indicating scope for an explosive price move.  Prices have bounced back a little in the last few hours, but the bearish mood is still intact with the cryptocurrency currently changing hands around $9,850, representing a 3 percent loss on a 24-hour basis.  The spread between the 50- and 100-day moving averages (MAs) of bitcoin's price has narrowed sharply and the two averages will likely soon produce a bearish crossover, as seen in the chart below.  A bearish crossover occurs when a short-term MA drops below a long-term MA. At time of writing, the 50- and 100-day averages are located at $10,504 and $10,492 and the former looks set to cross below the latter in the next couple of days.  If confirmed, the event would mark the first bear cross of the 50- and 100-day MAs since Sept. 16, 2018.  Technical analysis theory considers the bearish cross of long-term MAs as an advance warning of an impending price crash. They are, however, based on historical data and tend to lag price. Hence, bearish crossovers have limited predictive powers at best and often end up trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market.  For instance, the 50-day MA fell below the 100-day MA on Aug. 29, 2016, when BTC was trading near $570. The cryptocurrency remained flatlined in the next couple of days before rising above $600 on Sept. 4.  More importantly, the $570 price seen on Aug. 29 was never put to test throughout the meteoric rise to a record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017.  Observers may argue that last September's bearish crossover was followed by a sharp sell-off to levels below $5,000 in November. However, back then, the cryptocurrency was in a bear market. Also, prices remained sidelined above $6,000 for at least six weeks following the confirmation of the bear cross before dropping in November.  Currently, BTC appears to be in a bull market, having charted higher lows and higher highs in the second quarter. Hence, the latest bearish cross may not be a cause for worry for the bulls – especially considering BTC is still stuck in a three-month-long narrowing of its price range.  Daily and 4-hour charts  The upper edge of the contracting triangle is currently located at $10,857 while the lower edge is seen at $9,450.  A high-volume UTC close above $10,857 would confirm the breakout and imply a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,000 in April and could yield a break above the 2019 high of $13,880. That said, a more reliable indicator of bullish revival would be a weekly close above $12,000.  A triangle breakdown, if confirmed, would suggest a bearish reversal and could fuel a price drop to the 200-day moving average (MA), currently located $8,139.  The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is currently reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 reading. Further, the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is hovering in bearish territory below zero.  Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart shows a failed breakout followed by a bearish lower high and a drop below key support of $9,855 earlier today.  So, the stage looks set for the test of $9,450 – the lower edge of the contracting triangle. The immediate bearish case would weaken if prices rise above $10,458 (Sept. 13 high).

Development is apparently still in its early stages and follows a similar project from Venezuela, which launched its oil-backed petro token last year – also to avoid U.S.-led sanctions.  In a Wednesday report from Vice, Alejandro Cao de Benos – the official managing North Korea’s cryptocurrency conferences and a special delegate for the nation's Committee for Cultural Relations – said that the as-yet-unnamed token is expected to be “more like bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.”  Like the petro, the new crypto may be pegged to an asset within North Korea. ""Now we are in the phase of studying the goods that will give value to it,” Cao de Benos said, adding that there are ""no plans"" to peg a cryptocurrency to the North Korean won.  As reported, the nation will hold its second blockchain and cryptocurrency conference in February 2020.  North Korea has also been linked with major hacks that stole possibly $2 billion from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges (although the regime denies it).

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value closed (UTC) with 1.47 percent gains on Wednesday, having risen by 3.9, 1, 3.5, and 6.2 percent on Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap data.  The five-day winning streak is the longest since the end of May, as seen in the chart below.  Ether eked out moderate gains for five consecutive days, starting from May 23 to May 27. That winning trend accelerated the bull run from lows near $140 observed on April 2.  The cryptocurrency then went on to hit a high of $364 on June 26, before deflating to $167 at the end of August.  The latest five-day winning run is backed by an uptick in trading volumes and marks a reversal from the bearish trend seen in the July-August period.  So, there is a strong reason to believe that the pullback seen at press time could be short-lived. As of writing, ETH/USD is changing hands at $207, having hit a high of $216.60 in the U.S. trading hours yesterday.  However, despite the minor correction, ether is still up 16 percent on a seven-day basis. Meanwhile, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is down 2.66 percent.  Ether’s positive performance has boded well for other alternative cryptocurrencies.

The expansion comes after the firm inked a deal with local payments company ECPAY to access its network that includes all 7-Eleven stores in the country.  The service lets any user of an Abra wallet purchase crypto via 7-Eleven's CLIQQ app or kiosks. Terms include a minimum deposit requirement of 500 Philippines pesos (roughly $10) and a maximum purchase amount of 100,000 pesos (over $1,900) per day. Users will be charged a two percent transaction fee and can purchase all of Abra's offered cryptocurrencies through their wallet.  Abra founder and CEO Bill Barhydt said:  “Now Abra users in the Philippines can quickly and easily add pesos into Abra and use that to invest in cryptocurrencies or popular stocks like Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc., which opens up a world of new possibilities to build wealth.”  The app firm said back in February that it was launching a new service that allowed customers to invest in fractions of stocks of NASDAQ-listed firms. It also supports 30 cryptocurrencies and over 50 fiat currencies.  The new partnership ""widens the product and service offerings of ECPay to its Collection Partners like 7-Eleven, NCCC Department Stores and Supermarkets, LCC Malls and other Remittance, Pawnshop partners,” said Trisha D.

42382671,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sbdT,1568880054,Everyone's Worst Fears About EOS Are Proving True,"The Takeaway:  EOS is the world's seventh-largest blockchain by market cap, with a value topping $3 billion since February 2019.  However, the project has long been plagued by fears that its structure was too centralized, and now the lion's share of entities that govern the chain are in China, prompting fears of state intervention.  EOS contributors devoted to building decentralized apps (dapps) and development tools for the blockchain are losing clout – and making little or no money from contributing to the health of the ecosystem. One of them publicly disavowed the blockchain earlier this month, citing the excessive power of the largest EOS token holders.  Block.One, the company that launched the code behind EOS following a $4.1 billion ICO, is the largest token holder. Critics say it could easily redefine governance on the chain but has yet to take action.      In early September, one of the small companies that helped to get the EOS blockchain off the ground called it quits.  EOS Tribe, which participated in the launch of the first EOS chain, announced on Steemit that it was stepping away from EOS as a block producer (BP) candidate, focusing on other blockchains and other implementations of the EOSIO software.  EOS Tribe's Eugene Luzgin wrote in the post:  ""We at EOS Tribe have never participated in the game of vote trading and stayed true to our principles, and hence while we leave EOS as Block Producer, we are also free to speak truth and give warnings to the rest.""  Which, as they say, is a lot to unpack.  Luzgin left, in short, because he said it is no longer possible to earn funds for maintaining the blockchain without support from major EOS whales, the colloquial term for those with very large token holdings. Those whales are overwhelmingly supporting BPs located in China. There are 21 BPs at any time who establish consensus on the chain, make governance decisions and earn substantial rewards.  This has become a widespread point of concern among longtime participants in the EOS community, for reasons that include centralization and threatened censorship-resistance, according to an investigation by CoinDesk.  The BPs that Luzgin believes have the strongest technical proficiency have overwhelmingly been relegated to lower-tier rewards or no rewards at all.  ""They effectively have a brain-drain now,"" Luzgin told CoinDesk in an interview.  He's not alone in his concerns, though it might be easy to dismiss doubters' complaints as a simple East-West divide – two EOS constituencies that literally speak different languages failing to build a consensus about the protocol.  There is no proverbial smoking gun showing that the present configuration of BPs is bad for the $3.8 billion blockchain, but there is a mountain of evidence bolstering the case for concern.  DPoS in action  EOS is the world's seventh-largest blockchain by market cap as of this writing. It went live in June 2018, after a yearlong initial coin offering (ICO) that raised $4.1 billion in crypto for Block.One and a tumultuous process following the release of EOSIO software, the code that powers EOS and its forks.  The chief feature of EOS was always its most controversial: EOS uses a consensus model called delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), where higher throughput is achieved by decreasing the number of nodes that participate in consensus.  Before EOS launched, the configuration was widely panned by crypto investors as too centralized. Blockchain Capital's Spencer Bogart shared an opinion held by many in April 2018 when he wrote that blockchains that compromise on permissionless-ness ""will end up as less efficient varieties of today’s centralized platforms.""  DPoS can take many forms, but on EOS, 21 nodes have all the power over the chain. These 21 nodes are chosen by token holders, who stake EOS coins in a vote for up to 30 BPs. The ones with the most votes serve in the top 21, and the vote is effectively continuous. That means BPs can move in and out of the top 21 at almost any time.  As of this writing, a majority of the BPs indicate their locations as within China. Sources tell CoinDesk that multiple others are also located in China despite outward appearances.  CoinDesk surveyed all the top BPs as of Sept. 6, with questions about what they viewed their role on the blockchain to be and how they were supporting its users. Six sent back detailed answers. CoinDesk found no way to contact three others.  To produce blocks  The top 21 earn significant revenue, and another roughly 50 (this number is not fixed) earn meaningful revenue as standby BPs, both sharing a portion of the 1 percent annual inflation of EOS tokens.  With EOS Tribe's departure, Aaron Cox of Greymass, a BP candidate, told CoinDesk:  ""I can't help but think that's the new trend. This downward spiral (which ultimately is just a race to the bottom) isn't a good situation to be in, as rent seekers continue to take over. And if it continues will probably become more dire as more of us are cut off.""  Many BPs that were once often seen in the top 21 now no longer even qualify for rewards as standby BPs, including BP candidates such as EOSSphere, ShEOS, EOSAmsterdam, EOS Detroit, EOS Dublin and EOS Venezuela.  Greg Simpson built EDNA, which is designed to enable users to monetize their genetic information, with the original EOS in mind. EDNA is a decentralized application (or dapp) running on the software Block.One created.  But these days he's hedging by using EOS and its two main forks, Telos and Worbli, because of uncertainty about EOS due to what he perceives as inadequate governance.  Still, he's not ready to give up yet. This has been a rapidly changing space.  ""It wasn't this space three months ago. And it won't be the same space three months from now,"" Simpson said. ""Really no one can project out what it's gonna look like in a year.""  Either way, EOS has not proved to be the high throughput chain beloved by enterprise clients that its progenitors touted it to be. Mainly, it has become a chain for running gambling dapps.  Luzgin lamented developers who have put all their creativity into EOS moving down into standby BP or even unpaid status. He pointed to companies like Bitfinex and Huobi who are participating in its consensus.  ""EOS is a just a side gig for them. It's just extra revenue,"" Luzgin said, comparing the exchanges to companies that are all-in on the blockchain's potential. ""That view is very different. They aren't really participating in the community.""  Huobi and Bitfinex were among a handful of BPs that never replied to CoinDesk's inquiries.  EOS: Outsider history  EOS has faced skepticism from the broader crypto world from the start. Shortly after EOS launched, crypto scions looked askance again when the leading BPs moved to right a wrong.  Among their first collective acts, BPs froze seven accounts that had been shown to hold stolen tokens (tokens attained by tricking users during the migration of assets from ethereum – upon which Block.One ran the token sale – to the actual EOS blockchain).  The decision to freeze those accounts presaged the controversy the blockchain is facing now, because the top BPs did so without any kind of agreed-upon governance process. A ""constitution"" had been drafted, but it had not passed a referendum of EOS users.  It was never entirely clear where legitimacy originated from on EOS, but when the chain started, 15 percent of the tokens needed to be staked for a vote in order for it to launch. So that 15 percent figure became the consensus figure for giving a governance document legitimacy, but it never happened.  That consensus was documented as a rule in a draft constitution that never got ratified.  One of the BPs at the time, EOS New York, wrote after the vote to freeze the seven accounts about its ambivalence in freezing funds without any legitimized authority to do so.  The organization's statement read:  ""As a community, it should be our top priority to develop the mechanisms that are capable of polling the token-holder community and obtaining the on-chain consensus required to move issues, like the Constitution, forward.""  EOS New York was one of the original 21 BPs at the chain's launch.  Eventually, EOS would jettison the whole idea of a constitution for governing the chain. Dissatisfaction in the community around governance would grow, which brings us to today.  Brock Pierce, an early member of the Block.One team and still an active member of the EOS community, would make waves in June 2019 with a speech at the Tulip Conference when he suggested that EOS is now governed by a ""Chinese oligarchy.""  https://youtu.be/SdzF4X1Eb2c  And while it's true that a majority, if not a supermajority, of BPs right now are based in China, Cox of Greymass insists that the concern is not specifically about China itself. He told CoinDesk:  ""The threat itself in this centralization is due to shifting regulations and potential risks they may pose. If the BPs for EOS were 90 percent in India, Brazil, or any other country – the same concerns would still be valid in regards to centralization.""  In his post, EOS Tribe’s Luzgin noted that shortly after EOS launched it started to see BP candidates joining the top 21 who hadn't participated in the launching of the chain at all, propelled there by supportive votes from whales. By the summer's end, Block.One, still the largest holder of EOS, started to make noise about voting its stake in favor of the teams it deemed the most technically proficient.  Block.One holds so many tokens that it could all but handpick the top 21 BPs (or at least exclude any BP that did not get its nod). Yet more than a year later, it still has not cast its first vote.  Shortly after the Tulip Conference, Block.One CEO Brendan Blumer wrote a post on the main EOS Telegram channel, where he addressed a number of issues without getting very specific. On voting, he wrote:  ""EOS governance is tricky and is not something we’ve chosen to ignore, but have been waiting for the right time to get involved, and in a way that upholds and furthers aligns and decentralizes the community.""  Today, here's what EOS governance has settled on: At any time, any decision can be made if 15 of the 21 BPs move to support it. It doesn't matter if in the next set of blocks those BPs change dramatically. To reduce the prior decision, that new set of BPs would need to establish a new supermajority of BPs.  There is a system in place to run a vote across all EOS holders, but now, according to EOS New York, referenda are simply a way of gauging the interest of holders.  Dapp disappointment  One of the complaints that members of the community often make about the current crop of BPs is that they don't prioritize building new dapps that will attract other users to the blockchain.  The theory had been that BPs would use inflation rewards to fund new tools, code improvements and dapps to improve the ecosystem. One of the first consequences of EOS's failure to agree upon a shared decision-making process was the burning of approximately $167 million in the EOS savings account that had been designated for the worker proposal system.  As previously reported, the proposal system had been a way to fund dapp development on EOS (as well as community functions, lobbying costs and security audits), but without a way to agree on how to distribute the funds, they just accumulated, diluting the market cap to no purpose.  So, all 34 million EOS got burnt on May 8, 2019 – with potential funding for thousands of new applications going with it.  Broader changes were already underway as that decision was finalized, though. In February, EOS New York proposed an EOS User Agreement (EUA). In April, the EUA was ratified by 15 of the 21 BPs at the time, according to a spokesperson for EOS New York, who took a role shepherding it through.  What's notable about the EUA is what it doesn't address: in particular, vote-buying. The interim constitution explicitly forbids vote-buying but the EUA is silent on the topic.  There had always been a concern that EOS BPs could protect their lucrative position on the network by sharing block rewards. A top BP can earn about 900 EOS a day, which works out to over $1 million per year at current prices.  Said Greymass's Cox:  ""EOS was one of the few DPoS blockchains where [vote-buying] wasn't happening until earlier this year with the introduction of the EUA. Many (maybe the majority?) other DPoS blockchain operate under this model, some even with it baked right into their protocols.”  In an email to CoinDesk, Newdex, a decentralized exchange on EOS, explained how its affiliated company, Newpool, spends its block rewards.  ""More than 90 percent of the pool rewards will be given to token holders, that incentivizes token holders to hold EOS tokens for long and also increase their participation in the community,"" a spokesperson for the company told CoinDesk.  Another highly rated BP, Big One, also welcomes participants to stake votes for the blockchain and profit for doing so. Infinity Stones invites staking on any number of protocols, including EOS.  ""The thing about vote-buying is that at this point there's technically nothing against the 'rules' about it,"" Cox said. ""There's not much value-add happening in this new market dynamic, just the shuffling of meaningless inflation.""  Whatever anyone thinks morally about the optics of vote-buying, the consequence is this: BPs engaging in vote-buying invest in ensuring their leadership positions and not in the actual ecosystem. That's what frustrates those who want to see EOS grow.  EOS Tribe's Luzgin calls it the difference between ""builders"" and ""miners."" Builders, he argues, want block rewards to fund larger contributions. Miners want the block rewards. The latter strategy has been rapidly gaining ground.  Vote-buying to guarantee block rewards raises a philosophical question: Is it appropriate to expect BPs to spend part of their resources on new tools and dapps?  Where is it written that that's an obligation of BPs? The answer: It's not.  There was a consensus among those who participated in the launch of the blockchain that a BP should be reinvesting in EOS. In fact, the thinking then was that a company could earn votes from community members for their BP candidacy by building good, widely used tools. That strategy hasn't held up.  And not everyone agrees that it should even be an expectation. One BP, EOS Wiki, responded to a question about what the company had done to help create new dapps in a statement delivered via Telegram:  ""We would not answer this question although we are incubating dapp/app. All is because this is not a 'legal duty' of being a block producer, please read the EUA.""  EOS Blockchain: Performance consequences  Some sources hint that there have been bad signs for the fundamental performance of the blockchain. Others say everything is mostly fine.  ""We see top BPs missing not just blocks but whole rounds,"" Luzgin told us. ""They are supposed to produce 12 blocks. They miss all 12.""  Here's what CoinDesk has been able to discern: One of the BPs that Greymass and EOS Tribe still pointed to as a builder of useful things on the network and one that still mostly manages to stay in the top 21, Attic Lab, out of Ukraine, was able to point to one particular metric where it stands out.  Aloha EOS has tracked a benchmark test for BPs since the very early days, and Attic Lab has consistently scored the highest on those measurements. Aloha EOS scores the benchmark by asking each BP to run a calculation and timing it. Recently, Big.One, the second-most-backed BP, and the BPs run by two exchanges (Bitfinex and Huobi) have scored the lowest.  Another way that dapp developers see EOS as losing ground is in the area of application program interfaces (APIs). APIs make it easier for apps to query the state of the chain and push transactions. The most robust APIs allow a dapp to query the full history of EOS. Since the blockchain is generating thousands of transactions, this is an expensive service to offer.  Cox argued:  ""BPs should be providing API access since they are the ones building the actual blocks, and providing direct access to their internal networks (through APIs) gives users a direct path to submit transactions.""  On Sept. 6, 11 BPs were currently providing some kind of API at that time, according to Cox. There are different APIs and different levels of quality of APIs, too. Cox said that many dapps have told his company that its is the fastest, this despite the fact that Greymass is, lately, a standby and not a full BP.  ""Subjectively, it feels wrong that the lower-ranked BPs are the one shouldering this cost,"" he wrote, while also noting that a good API requires hardware and skill to run, such that even well-funded BPs may not be equipped to run one.  ""As the blockchain grows, it will be harder to catch up,"" EOS Tribe's Luzgin said, because it's such a gigantic amount of data.  On Sept. 13, EOS Nation's BP scanner only showed two entities providing full-history APIs.  EDNA's Simpson told CoinDesk that the unreliability of some BPs required EDNA to revise its code so it checked more than one API, for when some weren't operational or when blocks were dropped.  And it is worth noting that there are other services a BP can provide that can also benefit the community that don't fit neatly into these buckets.  For example, CertiK, a security company, noted that it provides security services to the network rather than APIs. Newdex said it directed votes to BPs providing useful services in order to help them earn funds.  Meet.One has been providing news about EOS in Chinese languages for that audience, contributing code updates, new developer tools and funding meetups in China.  Still, most of the leading BPs simply didn't reply to CoinDesk's questions about the current controversy around the blockchain's leadership. This controversy is well-trod ground within EOS and its many, many Telegram channels.  Those who believe the blockchain needs to advance await some kind of resolution. EDNA's Simpson assessed the current crop of BPs, held in place by large positions taken by a relatively small number of users, and asked:  ""What is it that's driving the vote? It's certainly not innovation. It's not production. It's not making the blockchain more useable.""  What's being done  Maybe EOS is fine. Maybe it's in trouble. Either way, it's worth casual investors knowing that a cadre of adherents to the protocol since the early days are growing concerned.  At this stage, there is no one prevailing cause for concern about EOS. It is a blockchain seeing a large amount of use, but it also has not yet attained the status of a blockchain that attracts major companies looking for a highly secure database with high throughput. That's what its strongest adherents had hoped it would become.  ""Block.One kind of screwed up royally because they could have used their leverage to steer in the right direction, but they chose not to do it,"" Luzgin said.  Perhaps most tellingly, Block.One itself has yet to launch (or really say anything more about) the service it announced in June with a glitzy and expensive rollout, Voice, its completely de-anonymized Facebook competitor. Block.One said the service would be built on the public EOS blockchain.  Lumi Wallet  recently compiled a comprehensive list of reform proposals floated by different parts of the community, assessing the pros and cons of each approach.  Lumi CEO Diana Furman told CoinDesk:  ""I was convinced that change is needed by the very fact of the discussion – we have been following the EOS community for long, and everyone, from ordinary users to the main figures of Block.One, has been discussing this topic. If there is a discussion, it means something needs to be done.""  Meanwhile, whole other chains have expressed their preferences for change by forking the blockchain and opening new instances of the EOSIO software. The two most notable implementations are Telos and Worbli.  Telos has added a number of innovations that ensure potential BPs are actually ready to serve, but its most notable reform was made in its genesis block, where Telos capped every account's token holdings at 40,000, thereby curtailing the power of whales on the network.  Worbli was created with financial regulation and certain consumer protections (such as account recovery) built in, with a focus on the financial industry.  Meanwhile, the broader community is waiting on Block.One to make any kind of move at all. Some have pushed it to turn a portion of its tokens over to a proxy, permitting users to deploy them as they saw fit, even to just enforce a rotation of BPs.  ""Any centralized blockchain will be looked down on,"" Luzgin said. ""I really like the technology behind it. ... [It's the] governance that's screwing it now.""  Block.One did not comment to CoinDesk as of press time.  Cox summed up the situation this way, expressing a wary sentiment shared by many who have remained involved with the EOS blockchain:  ""Evidence is hard to come by in concrete examples of damage, and even as to why any of this is a bad thing. I do at this point think we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg though.""

Binance's co-founder and chief marketing officer He Yi said at a media session on Tuesday during the Shanghai Blockchain Week that the exchange will specifically support fiat on-ramp via OTC for Chinese yuan.  He added that the new service will be part of Binance's plan in the coming months to dedicate more time and resources to compete in the Chinese market. Further, the exchange is also rolling out a payment service to allow users from 170 countries to buy crypto assets using fiat currencies at Binance.com.  Fiat-to-crypto OTC trading has been a critical part in terms of fiat on-ramp for crypto traders based in China as local authorities prevent the direct connection of exchanges to banks and fiat deposits as part of the ban on initial coin offerings in September 2017.  Other long-running Chinese exchanges like Huobi and OKCoin have since then moved overseas and offered crypto-to-crypto trading while recruiting OTC market makers onto their platforms to help users buy and sell cryptos using Chinese yuan.  The news about Binance's OTC capabilities comes as the exchange, which, according to CoinMarketCap data, is the world's largest by trading volume, quickly racks up deals that increase its links with the real economy and improve its connections to mainstream finance.  At the beginning of the month, it began to offer sandboxes for the testing of two crypto-futures trading platforms, dubbed Futures A and Futures B. Users will vote on which is the best. The following day, it said it acquired Seychelles-registered JEX, a crypto derivatives exchange.  Last week, Binance introduced a dollar-based stable coin, Binance USD, and said the coin received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  The exchange is pitching its stable coins as alternatives to Libre. Also in the U.S., Binance said it would start accepting U.S. customers via its partner from Sept. 18, after banning them earlier in the year.  And just yesterday, the exchange invested into Mars Finance, a Chinese crypto data and media company, although the amount of the investment was not disclosed.
