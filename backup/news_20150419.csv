42378159,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ML9v,1429459161,"Most Mt Gox Bitcoins Were Gone by May 2013, Report Claims","Mt Gox's missing bitcoins were stolen from the exchange over a period of time beginning in 2011, according to a new report released today by a group investigating its collapse.  They were gone long before the company's collapse in February 2014, the report said. Gox had therefore been operating on a fractional reserve basis for most of that time, either knowingly or unknowingly.  The stolen bitcoins had been withdrawn and sold off on various exchanges including Mt Gox itself, and given the timing probably at prices far below the 2013-14 highs.  Tokyo-based bitcoin security firm WizSec, which produced today's update and a previous one in February, has been conducting an unofficial investigation into Mt Gox's collapse based on data pieced together from various leaks, hacks and other sources.  Bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi and his police team have still not made all transaction data available, including a list of all the bitcoin addresses Mt Gox used.  WizSec's report says its team has assembled a list of over 2m bitcoin addresses related to Mt Gox by comparing leaked data with blockchain records and performing clustering analysis on addresses used at similar times.  Huge discrepancy  The resulting chart shows a dramatic difference between the number of bitcoins Mt Gox should have held, and what it actually held.  The company held little or no more than 100,000 BTC from May 2013 onward. Interestingly, neither the ideal nor actual totals includes the 200,000 BTC 'found' in cold storage after the collapse.  One key question (until now) has been whether Mt Gox's bitcoins were stolen or whether they ever existed at all, and records of their deposit faked.  Report author Kim Nilsson notes that the coins did in fact leave Mt Gox, meaning they definitely were deposited there at some point.  Speaking to CoinDesk, he said the WizSec team was ""happy to finally have this breakthrough out in the public"", but noted that there is still a lot of investigative work to be done by those with access to more complete data.  How many bitcoins did Gox have?  After a prior security breach in mid-2011, CEO Mark Karpeles performed a transaction proving the company controlled at least 424,242.42424242 BTC.  Using that figure as a baseline, Nilsson measured changes in total BTC held since that day, arriving at 950,000 BTC on the day of Gox's collapse in February 2014.  This matched total holdings stated elsewhere in leaked data, he wrote.  Not Willy  One surprising revelation from the latest report is that the bitcoins likely disappeared long before the appearance of Mt Gox's infamous trading bot, nicknamed ""Willy"".  Speculation surrounding Gox's dying days in 2013-14 had implied Willy was related somehow to the theft, though WizSec's report says that is no longer considered possible.  The bot may, however, have existed to convert the missing bitcoins into missing fiat currency amounts instead.  ""The possibility exists that this kind of manipulation may have been the main purpose behind Willy as a way of coping with the practical problems caused by such a massive bitcoin shortage. This is left for later investigations to clarify.""  Cold storage not monitored  That nearly all Mt Gox's bitcoins disappeared raises several questions about the nature of its cold storage system. How 'cold' was it?  The company was known to keep paper wallets stored under lock and key, which it added to and subtracted from as required. The cold storage system was also reportedly not monitored with any degree of scrutiny, meaning the thief was free to either compromise them or wait for the funds to be moved to a 'hot' wallet.  ""A reminder to all bitcoin businesses out there: Always. Monitor. Your. Bitcoins,"" Nilsson wrote.  To be continued  This latest report will again confirm suspicions many had about the way Mt Gox was run.  A newspaper report at the beginning of the year claimed the theft was an 'inside job' by someone with access to the company's system. Today's revelation that Gox was indeed running a fractional reserve will also surprise few – other than the sheer length of time over which it happened.  Trustee Kobayashi announced in November that exchange Kraken would assist with the investigation, as well as manage the claims process and distributing Mt Gox's remaining assets to creditors at some point in future.  Nilsson wrote that his contribution to the research has been voluntary, and hopes the work will now prove valuable to the authorities in their continuing investigation.

42378168,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MLIj,1429452557,21 Chairman Hints at Stealth Startup's Larger Mission,"Attendees of the second annual Bitcoin Job Fair received a few new details as to what may be in development at secretive startup 21 Inc on Saturday during a rare public talk by one of its top executives.  Featuring displays from industry groups as diverse as ShapeShift and Trustatom and held at Plug and Play Tech Center's Sunnyvale incubator, the day-long event's main attraction was 21 Inc chairman and Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan, with the busy crowd of job seekers coming to a veritable standstill for its duration.  Despite the absence of any big reveal, Srinivasan did expand at length on his larger vision for the technology, one that while successful at categorizing the possibility enabled by the digital currency, was sometimes quick to dismiss many subjects of ongoing debate in the industry related to regulation and network scalability.  Consistent with the talk's wide arch, Srinivasan first attempted to characterize bitcoin's development as on par with the Internet's, telling the crowd:  ""The Andreessen Horowitz thesis on bitcoin is bitcoin is a protocol, payments are now packets. Bitcoin is here to stay.""  Bitcoin, his talk suggested, is on a similar trajectory, regardless of any issues facing the network.  Srinivasan went as far as to predict that society is fast moving toward a future where everyone can transmit value as easily as information, meaning anyone with an Internet connection will by extension be connected to the financial system.  ""Bitcoin is like tulips,"" he said. ""They're like tulips you can send anywhere in the world in arbitrary quantities.""  'Here to stay'  Overall, the presentation seemed designed to impart the impression that the bitcoin network is growing at an unstoppable pace, with Srinivasan rifling through a series of topics and talking points that seldom lingered for close inspection.  Srinivasan suggested that bitcoin is now moving to a stage of institutional acceptance, noting his belief that organisations are reaching the point where they need to adopt bitcoin strategies due the momentum of adoption and the fact that ""VC investment [is] perhaps poised to break $1bn this year"".  Srinivasan suggested he believes bitcoin will prevail over models in the existing financial system because of its open-source model, using examples from the early Internet to support his view.  ""Bitcoin is to PayPal as Linux is to Windows. It is open-source, decentralized and programmable. We went from landline to IP addresses. We're going from personal bank accounts to machine bitcoin wallets,"" he said.  This portion of the talk included time spent attacking what he characterized as one of the ecosystem's most common ""memes"", that there can be blockchains without bitcoin, or distributed open ledgers without a token that incentivizes use.  ""One way to understand mining is that in return for doing transactions you get to add a direct deposit to yourself,"" Srinivasan said. ""For a blockchain to exist, that token introduction needs to be there at least under the paradigm that we had.""  Should such a system be capable of existing, he said, it hasn't been discovered.  ""We think it's going to be bitcoin or nothing at the present time,"" he added.  'Bigger than Google'  One of the more oft repeated talking points was Srinivasan's assertion that ""bitcoin is bigger than Google"" in terms of its network footprint, a point that dominated the early part of the presentation.  ""All of Google today would represent less than 1% of mining. The sheer degree of what is happening in mining hasn't been appreciated in the press,"" Srinivasan said in one of many suggestions that 21 Inc may still be focused on transaction processing as rumored around the time of its original 2013 fundraising.  Srinivasan went on to make the assertion that, based on estimates from last publicly available data, the bitcoin mining network is now bigger than Google in terms of computing power and power consumption.  ""If we assume there are 10 million Google servers and each of these servers is running. You can multiply that through and you get about one petahash. If they turned off all their data centers and pointed them at bitcoin, they'd be less than 1% of the network,"" he continued.  Srinivasan encouraged the audience to think of bitcoin as the world's ""largest supercomputer"", one that he inferred perhaps needed to be tapped for opportunities, if only for its sheer size.  ""Many metrics are up across the board. There's now more than five million wallets, long-term transactions are up. There is a roadmap for scalability. It is likely we'll be able to handle more than seven transactions per second,"" he said.  Inevitable solutions  Consistent throughout the talk was Srinivasan's implication that problems with the bitcoin network will be solvable due to the distributed nature and collaborative development that is occurring globally.  ""Bitcoin is open source. Ten-minute confirmation times can be changed,"" he said.  Srinivasan dismissed the idea of a 51% attack, whereby malicious miners take control of or otherwise corrupt the ledger, as ""overblown"", suggesting that technical solutions have already been proposed.  Legal issues were also dismissed via the notion that ""the technology as a whole can't be banned"".  ""Are there legal issues? I think that was a reasonable concern in 2013, [but] I don't think that's a reasonable thing today,"" Srinivasan said.  He further characterized the US government's sale of confiscated bitcoin at auction as ""implicit sanction"" and a sign of institutional acceptance.  ""A lot of people thought there was going to be a crackdown on bitcoin. Now, neutral to positive things are being said. Since the [US Senate] hearings in late 2013, there's been a real turn around,"" he continued.  Price problems  Despite the presentation's focus on issues of network health and infrastructure development, the talk ended by addressing what Srinivasan categorized as the biggest issue facing bitcoin, the sagging value of the currency itself.  Part of this issue, he contends, will be solved by the network's own built-in incentivization process whereby miners are rewarded with bitcoin for processing transactions.  Still, Srinivasan suggested that there was work that could be done to increase the price further, suggesting that bitcoin's value will stabilize when the network begins to integrate a new third key party beyond consumers and merchants – vendors.  ""If you're giving bitcoin and getting back dollars, this is not good for the price,"" he continued. ""If you have closed loops, you have something where you're getting value out of bitcoin without selling it.""  To further stress the point, Srinivasan evoked the phrase ""buidl, not hodl"" (sic), an expression he suggested was meant to equate holding value in bitcoin as an action that was not purely speculative, but rather, beneficial for the network.  Fittingly, Srinivasan's talk ended with perhaps the most direct assertion as to what the company is currently developing, concluding:  ""This is the most important question of bitcoin, can we build those closed loops.""
