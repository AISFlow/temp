11473791,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525813,1680732645,"Cardano Poised For 30% Uptrend, But Must Breach This Barrier First","Cardano (ADA) has been making significant strides in the crypto market, maintaining a bullish bias for over three weeks as it follows an ascending trendline, recording higher highs and higher lows. However, despite this impressive performance, the altcoin’s gains have been capped by the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), causing ADA to trade sideways since the beginning of the month. This raises the question of whether ADA will continue its bullish streak and break above the 200-day EMA or face a potential correction in the near future. Related Reading: These Top 5 Meme Coins Are Bleeding As March 2023 Ends – Here’s Why Cardano’s Potential To See 30% Growth According to Coingecko, Cardano’s current price is $0.399106, having experienced an 8.1% rally over the past seven days and a 0.9% rally in the past 24 hours. Cardano’s price trajectory remains optimistic, with the possibility of maintaining its position above the 200-day EMA at $0.396 if buying momentum continues to increase. A successful flip of this hurdle into support could cement the ongoing uptrend, opening the path for further gains. Image: Binance Academy The next significant resistance level for Cardano is at $0.427, last tested in November before the FTX exchange meltdown caused a market-wide plunge. If the cryptocurrency can break through this resistance level, it could continue its ascent towards the $0.50 mark, indicating a remarkable 30% gain from current levels in highly bullish cases. Retail Investors Bullish On Cardano’s Ecosystem Potential Cardano’s bullish trend even received a better boost from recent data showing that retail investors held 66% of the ADA supply, according to Cardano Feed on Twitter. This statistic not only underscores the strong confidence the community has in the digital asset but also highlights its potential for growth. One of the key drivers attracting retail investors to Cardano is its thriving ecosystem of applications, which has enabled the network to outperform industry giants like Ethereum in staking participation. However, despite this positive outlook, market analysts warn that in a worst-case scenario, Cardano’s price could retest the March lows around $0.336, followed by the $0.323 support levels, or even dip further to tag the $0.296 support level. This would translate to a 25% plunge from the current price and potentially signal a trend reversal.

11461869,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525793,1680732401,Bitcoin Derivatives Market Shows Signs Of Potential Upswing,"Over the last two days, the Bitcoin (BTC) market has seen a significant increase in transfer volume, with a 153% rise in the number of transactions processed. This uptick in activity has caught the attention of an analyst for CryptoQuant under the pseudonym “Onchain Edge.” According to the analyst, one key market sentiment indicator is the taker buy-sell ratio, which measures the buying and selling activity in the Bitcoin derivatives market. Recently, the ratio has shifted significantly in favor of buying, indicating increased demand for Bitcoin derivatives and potentially signaling bullish sentiment in the market. Related Reading: Will Ethereum’s (ETH) Shapella Upgrade Trigger A Sell-Off Or Bull Run? Bullish Months Ahead For Bitcoin? According to Onchain Edge, these indicators suggest that the Bitcoin market may be heating up, with increased demand and activity, which could lead to price gains shortly and lead BTC into a newly formed bull run for the rest of the year to take by storm its last all-time high. In addition to the taker buy-sell ratio, other metrics have shown significant changes in the Bitcoin market over the past few days. One of these metrics is the total number of coins transferred. This metric has shown a significant increase and indicates a high activity level in the Bitcoin network. It could also signify renewed interest in Bitcoin, as investors and traders are regaining their confidence in the largest cryptocurrency in the market in times of concerns and deception involving the global financial crisis. Onchain Edge highlights the increase in active wallets being used to send and receive coins, which has increased by over 63% compared to previous days, which is another sign of increased interest in BTC and the market’s bullish sentiment. BTC’s Accumulation Pattern Will Finally Break? Over the past 20 days, BTC has shown a re-accumulation pattern, with each drop quickly bought with force and volume. This pattern suggests that the market may have gone through its final consolidation phase and that a breakout may be looming for Bitcoin. According to trader and crypto analyst Jackis, this re-accumulation pattern indicates that the market is preparing for a breakout above $30,000 by the end of the week. Furthermore, for the analyst, the market now appears to have reached a point where “there is no more room left for further drops in price,” and liquidity is building above the current levels. Jackis suggests that there may be a significant amount of buying pressure waiting to be unleashed, potentially leading to the highly anticipated breakout above $30,000 and a further consolidation above this level. As of this writing, Bitcoin continues to consolidate at the $28,100 mark, well above its nearest support lines that have sheltered its price from dropping below the 200-day and the 50-day moving average. Overall, these changes in the metrics and a further break of the re-accumulation pattern are positive signs for BTC in the short term, where a healthy pullback may occur in the next few days for a continuation of the rally. However, all indicate that the new bull market is in place and that Bitcoin will lead the rest of the crypto market to new highs over the next months. Related Reading: Bearish Signal?

42414005,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAsxgx,1680732125,Arbitrum Foundation Offers Crypto Governance Concessions After ARB Holder Uproar,"The Arbitrum Foundation on Wednesday proposed to expand ARB token holders' budget oversight and governance powers with two motions aimed at turning the page on last weekend's crypto governance meltdown.  In a Discord post, the Arbitrum Foundation said it ""will not move"" the 700 million ARB tokens that remain in its ""Administrative Budget Wallet"" until the community approved ""an acceptable budget"" for the sum. It also proposed actions that would make governance ""more accessible.""  The twin actions represented a major concession to token holders angry over being asked to ""ratify"" decisions the Arbitrum Foundation had already made – including the fate of nearly $1 billion in tokens. In a nod to the fracas, Arbitrum Foundation also issued a ""transparency report"" into how the organization came to be.  The new proposals come after a community-wide protest erupted over the Arbitrum Foundation’s move to quietly transfer 750 million ARB tokens to one of its own wallets last weekend. Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling system and the fourth-largest blockchain, with $2.24 billion in total locked value, according to decentralized finance-focused data analytics firm DefiLlama.  In response to the backlash, the Arbitrum Foundation, a centralized organization responsible for developing Arbitrum, submitted on Wednesday two new proposals that would curb its own powers and increase those of community members.  The first proposal, AIP-1.1, suggests placing the foundation’s 700 million remaining ARB in a “smart contract-controlled lockup” that will unlock over four years. According to the proposal, the foundation will not be able to use the tokens until community members approve a budget for the tokens’ allocation. A portion of the tokens will fund the Arbitrum Foundation’s operational budget for its first year.  The second proposal, AIP-1.2, aims to amend several governance documents for the Arbitrum ecosystem. One of the proposed amendments is to lower the threshold of the number of ARB tokens needed to post an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal on chain from five million ARB to 1 million ARB.  The decentralized autonomous organization’s members will have three days to provide feedback on the proposals. Afterward, the two proposals will be put up to a week-long snapshot vote, according to Arbitrum Foundation community lead, who goes by eli_defi on Discord.  While the Arbitrum Foundation has conceded to grant its token holders more control over its remaining 700 million ARB tokens, the organization already sold 10 million ARB tokens and loaned a further 40 million to Wintermute.",POSITIVE,ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ARB,"Elizabeth Napolitano, Sage D.

42410996,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvTZa,1680730657,"Bitcoin, Ether Momentum Traveling Divergent Paths","Momentum for Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) is currently traveling in opposite directions.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a technical indicator that measures price swings, suggests bitcoin’s price is stalling, while ether’s is likely to push higher in the near future. So far this week, BTC’s price has hovered around the $28,000 threshold where it’s stood most of the past three weeks, while ETH has risen above $1,900 for the first time in nine months.  A divergence between asset price and technical indicator occurs when price moves in one direction, and said indicator moves the opposite way. Often, such divergences foreshadow potential tops and bottoms in an asset’s price, or changes in direction.  Bitcoin’s current bearish divergence between price and momentum indicates that prices may have topped out in the short term, or at least have halted temporarily.  Bitcoin’s RSI  Bitcoin’s RSI has declined 14% since March 17. Over that identical time period BTC’s price has increased approximately 2%. RSI is often a proxy to measure an asset’s momentum.  Declining momentum relative to an asset’s price increase indicates that a directional move may be weakening, and warrants a cautious eye. Bitcoin’s RSI moving above 70 also sent it into an “overbought” range.  The RSI indicator ranges from 0 to 100, with levels above 70 implying that an asset is trading at a premium, and levels below 30 implying that an asset is “oversold” and trading at a discount. An example of this price and momentum dynamic occurred when BTC rose 36% between March 10 and March 17, while its RSI fell to 27.  Investors should note that “overbought” or “oversold” levels should not be interpreted as automatic signs to enter or exit an asset. Both conditions can persist for prolonged periods, but they should be monitored.  Ether’s price relative to momentum has contrasted to bitcoin as ETH's RSI has been rising in conjunction with its price.  Where BTC’s RSI has fallen 14% since March 17, ETH’s has been relatively flat, changing by 2%. ETH’s price has increased by 6% over the same period.  A more pronounced indication of agreement between ETH's price and momentum has occurred since March 27 with its price rising 10% and its momentum spiking 24%.  Additionally, ETH’s RSI hasn’t reached traditionally overbought levels since January, implying there may still be room to the upside for the asset.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/05/bitcoin-ether-momentum-traveling-divergent-paths,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b09283036e280f2bc41868412c584e1a1a00f40-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Largely based on its asset-light, lean operating structure, BTBT presents a more robust business model than most of its peers. We initiate with a Buy Long-Term rating and a $3.00 price target. Investment Thesis Bit Digital (BTBT) is a franchise that specializes in digital asset mining, specifically in the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining business, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States and Canada. Incorporated in 2017, BTBT's mining facilities operate with the intent of accumulating Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD) and seek to sell for fiat currency opportunistically depending on market conditions. Started as a peer-to-peer lending business, BTBT now has become a mainstay cog in the global adoption of blockchain technology, especially in terms of its application to Bitcoin production. Additionally, the company has recently entered Ethereum staking, thereby diversifying its digital asset mining business. While there has been volatility in the price of Bitcoin, there's no debate, from our perspective, about its long-term value. As the economy increasingly relies on digital means of payments, e-commerce, and globalization, the digital currency system, which suffers from a double-spending problem, is not equipped with the growing complexity of current economic demands and a growing public desire to partake in a completely decentralized financial system. We believe Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are here to not only fill that void but also serve other facets of the financial system. Apart from institutionalizing Bitcoin mining, which offers economies of scale, BTBT has incorporated a cost advantage (due to its judicious equipment procurement) and an asset-light strategy (courtesy of its hosting arrangements) into its business model, which differentiates the company from its competition. Under the leadership of its new CEO Sam Tabar, in 2023, BTBT is poised to make a potentially strong 71% surge in revenues, essentially due to strong growth in Hash rate (to 2.7 EH/s in Q3:22 from 1.6 in Q3:21 - almost a 70% increase), positive momentum in the Bitcoin price (a 47% increase since FY:22 year-end) and the company's recent thrust in the Ethereum staking business. We expect the expansion to be fully reflected in gross margin expansion and EBITDA margin recovery. We initiate coverage with a Buy long-term rating and a $3.00 price target (a 50:50 hybrid of an EV/revenue valuation of $2.72 and a book value-based valuation of $3.22), implying a capital appreciation potential of almost 110%). Economic Prospects of Bitcoin Remain Strong Global economies are relying increasingly on digital means of payments. Almost 90% of Americans are now using some form of digital payments, and digital-payments penetration increased to 89% in 2022. With increasing market penetration of e-commerce, the global adoption of digital means payments will continue to rise. The digital currency system, which is essentially a string of bits, suffers from a double-spending problem, in which a digital record can easily be copied and reused for payment. Traditionally, most of the digital payments have relied on a trusted third party, who, for a fee, prohibits double spending. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have replaced that third party, thereby democratizing the digital payment process by the introduction of a blockchain ledger, which ensures the distributed verification, updating, and storage of the record of digital transactions. Singular Research; Bank of Canada Bitcoins are becoming increasingly mainstream. A recent survey concluded that cryptocurrency is the future of finance. Conducted by the Harris Poll, this recent (October 2022) survey of over 2,000 adults found that nearly half of Americans are familiar with cryptocurrencies. The familiarity was especially higher in young adults, with more than 70% of those between the ages of 18-34 knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies. Increasing interest in cryptocurrencies is at least in part a result of individual investors looking for investment opportunities beyond equities and mutual funds, as over a quarter of Americans saw cryptocurrencies as a means of investment diversification. High inflation also piqued interest in adopting cryptocurrencies. Singular Research; McKinsey Digital Payment Survey Bitcoin has gained acceptance as legal tender across the globe. As shown in Exhibit 3, various government agencies have classified cryptocurrencies differently - some states have explicitly allowed its use and trade, and others have banned or restricted it. Though the legal status of Bitcoin varies substantially across countries, it's widely adopted globally. The legal status of cryptocurrencies is undefined in substantial parts of the globe, and we believe over time, the legality and usability of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin as a means of payment will increase. We note that unless Bitcoin is explicitly prohibited by the central bank of a country, it's up to vendors to accept it as a legal tender for sundry goods. As the usage of Bitcoin increases globally, especially for international trade, the risk a vendor does not accept Bitcoin decreases. On the flip side, though a ban on Bitcoin by central banks in China is a major impediment to the currency's global adoption and considering China's large population of 1.4 billion residents and status as the second-largest global economy, we emphasize that the ban on Bitcoin is not a referendum on utility of cryptocurrencies, but rather an affirmation of its broadening economic prospects, as it is widely speculated that China's ban was motivated by its own interests to support its own government-controlled cryptocurrency. Ever since El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in June 2021, several developing countries have followed suit. These nations see Bitcoin acquiescence as a means of global financial inclusion that can foster investment, innovation, and economic development. So, we believe that cryptocurrencies are an integral part of the global financial system. Singular Research; Wikipedia Bitcoin has gained traction in other facets of the financial system as well. Last year, Fidelity Investments included Bitcoin as an option for its employees' 401(k) accounts. Similarly, Mastercard (MA) will start allowing merchants to accept Bitcoin over its network. Likewise, Visa (V) has started a reward program in Bitcoin for its credit card customers. Lean Cost Structure The company's focus on second-hand miners helps keep its cost structure lean. Unlike its competitors, who order brand-new miners from manufacturers, BTBT purchases miners on the spot market. Additionally, the company can deploy these miners into production much quicker than its competitors and hence enjoys one of the shortest purchase-to-deployment lead times in the industry. Bit Digital, Inc.; Singular Research BTBT's deep roots in China were instrumental in building this cost-based competitive advantage. A crackdown on crypto mining in China presented this opportunity - essentially, strict restrictions on mining produced a huge surplus of miners. As the restrictions were implemented, China went from a market that had excess demand for mining equipment to one that had a huge surplus. Many Chinese crypto mining firms had to curtail or even cease operations. Consequently, most Chinese crypto mining firms went out of business, which made a large inventory of miners available at discounted prices in the spot market. Similarly, even manufacturers had to drop prices on new miners. Leveraging this anomaly, BTBT was able to purchase miners opportunistically from China. BTBT's North America-based competitors did not have this sourcing advantage and hence are exclusively dependent on more new miners that they buy directly from manufacturers. BTBT, on the other hand, had relationships throughout China that provides it unfettered access to new and used machines. By doing so, the company has managed to build a cost-effective fleet of miners. This dynamic continued throughout 2021 but played out by the end of H1 2022 when BTBT had fulfilled most of its mining equipment requirements. Interestingly, however, in H2 2022, as the Chinese procurement advantage disappeared, opportunity opened in the U.S. Due to the collapse of the price of Bitcoin last year, a secondary market for mining equipment took shape and developed. As a result of difficult economics of Bitcoin mining at that time, several BTBT competitors faced liquidity issues and some faced bankruptcy. Some of these competitors sold their mining equipment in the secondary market at distressed pricing, and companies like BTBT, which conserved a robust balance sheet, have been able to procure equipment opportunistically. Therefore, we believe a comparative cost advantage will likely continue in the near future. Singular Research; Visual Capitalist Outsourced Business Model In addition to cost advantages the company enjoys due to its strategic procurement of equipment, it has instituted certain other measures that keep its fixed costs down. Importantly, these measures help the company remain focused on Bitcoin mining and not engage in other vertical industry activities like hosting and power management. Following this strategy, the company is able to limit its spending elsewhere and focus on just equipment, as discussed in the previous section, instead of maintaining direct relations to power suppliers and related infrastructure vendors. Under hosting arrangements, BTBT's miners are maintained by third-party hosting companies that install and operate miners, provide IT consulting, maintenance, and repair work on-site. The third parties that the company has engaged in include Core Scientific Inc., Blockfusion USA Inc., Coinmint LLC, Digihost Technologies Inc., and Blockbreakers Inc. In addition to these hosting agreements, BTBT has further engaged in rate swap agreements with companies such as Riot Blockchain Inc. As of Q3 2022, BTBT has hosting arrangements in place of 228 MW, which provides the company enough hash power to support growth to over 6 EH/s. Investment Risks As a company that's engaged in the Bitcoin mining business, BTBT is exposed to fluctuations in Bitcoin prices, which affect both its profitability and valuation. BTBT has a substantial amount of cryptocurrency as part of its current assets on the balance sheet. A steep decline in cryptocurrencies held by the company could lead to weakening of the financial condition of the company. The company is currently not free cash flow positive, so the firm might need additional capital infusions to fulfill its operational needs. The company's operations and the cryptocurrencies held in inventory are vulnerable to cybercrime. Fintech companies and holders of cryptocurrencies are frequent targets of sophisticated hackers. A successful cyberattack could disrupt BTBT's operations. The cryptocurrency industry has made significant headway in several facets of the financial industry, but it's far from becoming a mainstream financial instrument. The company's long-term prospects hinge on cryptocurrencies becoming mainstream. Though we believe cryptocurrencies are gaining adoption, but if the momentum stalls and its usage remains limited to the early adopters, BTBT's long-term prospects will diminish. The cryptocurrency industry is increasingly coming under financial regulatory preview. Some governments have been proactive in adopting regulations, but others have essentially shunned cryptocurrencies altogether due to complex regulatory requirements. Evolving and unpredictable regulations that may be imposed on cryptocurrencies could pose a business risk to BTBT. Valuation We value BTBT using a combination of multiple based on industry peer companies (an EV/revenue multiple) blended with a balance sheet-based intrinsic valuation to derive a fair value target price for the company. In terms of the peer group, as shown in Exhibit 10, most of BTBT's peer companies are not profitable - with negative earnings, and hence a P/E valuation would not be appropriate. Similarly, most of BTBT's peers are not operationally profitable, making an EV/EBITDA valuation also not suitable. Therefore, we believe EV/Revenue would be the best multiple for the company. The Cryptocurrency peer group is currently trading at a 2.80x forward EV/Revenue multiple. We ascribe BTBT an EV/revenue multiple of 3.50x, a 25% premium to its peer group, essentially due to superior growth prospects and a better business strategy. Based on an EV/revenue multiple of 3.50x, we value BTBT at $2.72. Singular Research We also value the company using a book value-based valuation. As shown in Exhibit 10, the peer group is trading at 1.13x, trailing twelve-month book value. Attributing a 1.69x multiple, a 50% premium to the peer multiple, essentially due to its stronger balance sheet and improving cash flow position, based on a book value/share of $1.90, we value BTBT at $3.22. The combination of $2.72 at 50% and $3.22 at 50% results in a weighted average price target of $3.00, which represents an upside of over 110% as of the closing price of $1.43 on March 23, 2023.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4592515-bit-digital-turning-bits-into-bytes?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11459760.jpeg

42414009,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAsyCn,1680726107,Ether Circles Above $1.9K as Shanghai Hard Fork Nears,"Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, circled above $1,900 for much of Wednesday, a week before the Shanghai hard fork.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $1,913, up about 2.2%. Earlier in the day ETH surged to $1,941, its highest level since last August.  “Ether appears to be pushing higher out of a flag pattern, which supports near-term upside follow through,” Will Tamplin, senior analyst at technical analysis-based research firm Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk in an email.  The Shanghai upgrade, also called Shapella, will mark the completion of Ethereum’s full transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, and will enable staked ETH withdrawals. It is expected to go live on April 12.  Tamplin said ETH is likely to meet its resistance initially near $2,000, “a psychological threshold that roughly aligns with the August 2022 high.” Its initial support is near $1,670, he added.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was about flat from Tuesday, same time, to trade at around $28,280. BTC has been range-bound between $27,000 and $28,500 for much of the past three weeks,  Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata, noted in an email discussing crypto options markets that ETH’s 25-delta calls have become more expensive than ETH’s 25-delta puts, which showed traders' preference for upside exposure. Typically, the call buyer is bullish on the market, while the put buyer is bearish. Delta is a risk metric that estimates the change in price of a derivative, such as an options contract.  “The recent rally was heavily led by BTC, but now with the upgrade and the enthusiasm around Twitter and dogecoin speculation, we’re seeing interest begin to pick up in altcoins,” Magadini wrote.  ETH continued to turn deflationary, with its annualized inflation rate currently sitting at -0.32%, according to data from ultrasound.money. This means the amount of ETH being burned is more than what is being minted.  Meanwhile, Lido DAO’s LDO and Rocket Pool’s RPL, the liquid staking protocols’ governance tokens, both rose over 2%, according to CoinGecko’s data.  Among other altcoins, cross-chain bridge protocol Stargate Finance's native STG token gained more than 14% on Wednesday, while encrypted messaging protocol Mask Network's MASK token sank 4%. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, recently increased 0.6% from a day ago.  “In the bigger picture, if Q2 does indeed prove to be an alt-driven quarter, in a replay of 2020, then we expect the best trade would be to fade any sharp vol rallies from here on both BTC or ETH,” Singapore-based crypto options trading firm QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast on April 4.  “If we are really in the replay of 2020, then Q2 consolidation will prove to be a short pause before the uptrend resumes in Q3/Q4,” the firm added. “The timing of this will be decided by how quickly the Fed changes course in the face of the rapidly slowing economy.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/05/ether-circles-above-19k-as-shanghai-hard-fork-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5630eae135ef2ea94856ac1e5c3de7273c3744c4-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394485,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8L9r,1680724687,What Is Decentralized File Storage?,"Cloud storage services such as Dropbox and Google Cloud changed how we store and share big files of videos and photos online. They let anyone store terabytes of data at a fraction of the price of a new hard drive, with files accessible on demand from any device. But there’s a catch: Users must rely on the risk management system of a centralized entity that could rescind their access to their account at any time, share their files with snooping government agencies or even go bankrupt, leaving customers scrambling to find another solution before their files disappear.  Web3 offers another alternative: decentralized file storage networks such as Filecoin, Storj and Arweave. Instead of storing data with a single cloud company, decentralized file storage protocols cut up your data into tiny pieces, then store packets on pseudonymous computers (nodes) linked up to a decentralized network. Decentralization means that files are protected by a network formed of lots of different stakeholders rather than a single company.  The decentralized network in question is often (but not always) a blockchain. Instead of processing transactions for crypto, validators process file space for crypto – usually the native token of the protocol’s file-sharing service. For example with Filecoin, FIL is used as a reward for participants providing file storage.  To earn that crypto, validators must prove they’re storing a file on their hard drive in a consensus mechanism often called proof-of-storage. This virtual money is designed to keep validators honest and trustworthy, providing those who run the nodes with an incentive to maintain your data.  Unlike centralized file-sharing services you pay for in fiat currencies, usually as a monthly subscription service, decentralized file services run on cryptocurrencies. Space is rented out and paid for in cryptocurrency – usually the native token of the decentralized file-sharing protocol. So once again, if you used Filecoin to store your files, you’d pay in FIL according to how much storage you needed.  Note that decentralized file storage networks are different – but similar! – to peer-to-peer file storage networks such as torrent services or Napster. Those work by having one group of people, known as seeders, host files and another group, known as leechers, download fragments of files from lots of leechers. This is how torrent sites like ThePirateBay operate. The benefits are similar: censorship-resistant file sharing. That’s why they became so popular as a platform for illegally downloading movies and music.  Pros and cons of decentralized storage  One benefit of decentralized storage systems is political – or more precisely, that it is designed to be apolitical. Files stored on a decentralized file service are resistant to the decisions of any centralized authority, such as a government who wishes to control and censor content. It also prevents having a private company enforce its own politics by refusing service or taking other action on the files it holds, such as sharing it with law enforcement.  With decentralized storage, there’s no single authority that can prevent certain kinds of files, even illegal material, from being stored on these networks, which is an issue to be aware of. These networks are also private. Data stored on these networks is encrypted before being stored on the network, and no single computer holds enough chunks of the file to piece together the puzzle and deduce what is contained within the file.  One big pro of decentralized storage is that it is often far cheaper than storing an equal amount of data on cloud providers like AWS or Azure.  Decentralized file storage networks in action  So, where can you find one of these decentralized file-sharing networks? One of the most popular such networks is called IPFS, short for the InterPlanetary File Network. It is used to host non-fungible tokens (NFT) and websites, too, with the claim being that these media are resistant to censorship and cannot be taken down by the creators of the protocol.  IPFS was developed by Protocol Labs and launched in 2015. Data on IPFS is stored in several locations, then pieced together whenever anyone needs to download files contained within its network. IPFS isn’t based on a blockchain, but its hashes can be contained within the metadata of a blockchain transaction.  Protocol Labs is also the creator of Filecoin, though Filecoin operates independently of IPFS while sharing several of the same ideas; indeed, all Filecoin nodes are IPFS nodes. The main difference is while IPFS is built for short-term retrieval of data, Filecoin is built for longer-term persistence of data. A rival called Arweave does much the same thing. One of the main differences is in the payment structure: Data is deleted from Filecoin if monthly bills remain unpaid while Arweave stores data permanently. Other competitors in the market include Sia, Akash and Storj.

11456559,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525786,1680722318,Will Ethereum’s (ETH) Shapella Upgrade Trigger A Sell-Off Or Bull Run?,"The upcoming Shapella upgrade for Ethereum (ETH) is set to introduce several new features to the network, including the ability for users to withdraw their staked ether. While this is a new milestone for Ethereum users, there is some concern about whether it can lead to a sell-off and potentially result in a decline in Ethereum’s price action. Related Reading: Whale Accumulates 229 Billion Shiba Inu Tokens, What’s Next? Significant Market Activity Ahead Of The New Upgrade For ETH As Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade approaches, investors are speculating about the potential impact on Ethereum’s price action and the timing of the anticipated bull run. One area of concern is the ability for users to withdraw staked ether, which could lead to a decrease in demand for the cryptocurrency and trigger a drop in its value. The uncertainty around how many users will take advantage of this new feature and how much ether will be withdrawn from the network adds to the concern. A recent report by the formerly known Arcane Research, now K33 research firm, suggests that the upcoming Shapella upgrade for Ethereum could lead to the sale of around 1.3 million ETH, with a total value of approximately $2.4 billion. Most of this is expected from reward withdrawals, with an estimated 1.1 million ETH being sold. Additionally, the report suggests that around 158,000 ETH could be sold as part of the bankruptcy proceedings for collapsed crypto lending platform Celsius. This could put downward pressure on ETH’s price, particularly if they are sold in large quantities. Furthermore, according to Satoshi Club, another factor contributing to the potential sell-off is the recent Wells Notice received by the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. The notice requires Kraken to comply with US securities laws and regulations, which could result in the exchange unstaking all ETH held by US investors. Will ETH’s Support Levels Hold A Potential Sell-Off? While the report suggests that the upcoming upgrade for Ethereum could lead to the sale of approximately 1.3 million ETH, some factors may mitigate the potential impact on the market, according to Satoshi Club. The estimated 1.3 million ETH represents only around 20% of ETH’s average daily trading volume. This means that the selling pressure will not likely overwhelm the market, and buyers will have the opportunity to match the volume of ETH sold. Furthermore, withdrawing staked ether is not instantaneous and can take 5 to 6 days to complete. This means the selling pressure will likely spread over several days. This can help to prevent sharp price drops and allow the market to adjust to the increased supply of ETH. Additionally, according to Satoshi Club, Mac Eberhardt, an analyst at Saxo Bank, has suggested that most of the stakers are long-term investors committed to the Ethereum Network and its future growth. This means that they are unlikely to sell their holdings in response to short-term market fluctuations or the ability to withdraw staked ether. As of this writing, Ethereum’s price continues to show strength, trading at $1,890 with a 1.4% gain in the last 24 hours. In extreme selling pressure, the $1,830 level could serve as a threshold for ETH, potentially preventing a significant drop in value.

42387755,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQsNx9,1680721844,M11 Credit Resumes Crypto Lending on Maple Finance After FTX-Spurred Pause,"M11 Credit has reopened lending and is raising fresh capital for its new crypto lending pool on blockchain-based credit marketplace Maple Finance, the firm tweeted Wednesday.  It also appointed a new head of credit and has upgraded its risk management and credit underwriting process, a Maple blog post said.  The new developments came after pools managed by M11 Credit suffered $36 million of defaults, other loans missed payment and it restructure following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November. While some crypto watchers saw FTX’s sudden implosion as a black swan event, the subsequent contagion to trading firms and lenders highlighted crypto lending’s deficiencies in risk management and credit underwriting.  Notably, Orthogonal Trading, one of the largest borrowers of M11 pools, allegedly misled M11 and Maple by misrepresenting its financials and losses from FTX. Subsequently, investors in the affected pools faced up to 80% losses on their deposits.  Read more: Maple Finance's $54M of Sour Debt Shows Risks of Crypto Lending Without Collateral  Crypto lending drought  Following the events, M11 Credit expanded its team that oversees crypto lending activities and upgraded its underwriting process and credit policy, including introducing real-time monitoring of assets on blockchain and off-chain, according to Maple.  The new M11 Credit lending pool is a permissioned USD coin (USDC) stablecoin pool, where liquidity providers need to go through know-your-customer (KYC) checks to invest.  The pool’s first borrower is digital asset trading firm Flow Traders, which took out a 3.5 million USDC loan with a 60-day term for 12.5% annualized interest rate, according to Maple’s public loan dashboard.  M11 said it is raising additional funds for the pool to lend to a “highly reputable and creditworthy market-neutral trading firm that we've carefully vetted.”  Representatives of M11 Credit did not immediately return a request for comment.  M11’s renewed activity on crypto credit markets and the recent debt restructuring of trading firm Auros may signal a turning point for crypto lending after the FTX collapse led to lenders recalling loans and reducing lending.  The upcoming volatility on crypto markets and scarcity of lending after the blowup of multiple centralized lenders present an opportunity for M11 Credit, the firm tweeted Wednesday.  “We anticipate that the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, persisting regulatory pressure and prevailing macro risks may elevate volatility in the cryptocurrency market, presenting opportunities for market-neutral trading firms and driving demand for trading capital.”  Read more: Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade Could Bring $2.4B Selling Pressure to Ether: Observers",POSITIVE,USDC,ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/05/m11-credit-resumes-crypto-lending-on-maple-finance-after-ftx-spurred-pause,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/425d67a7d6e5b13cf111af8b9e618e6687a97aca-1438x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.S. stock market will be closed in observance of the Good Friday holiday. However, the U.S. government doesn't recognize that day as an official federal holiday. As a result, while stock trading may be offline, Wall Street will still receive the latest round of monthly jobs data, with March's figures set to come out at 8:30 AM ET as usual. That means it will be Monday before traders can react to the report in particular, which may make for a calmer response. The April 7 payrolls print, which covers statistics for March, is expected to slide from February’s 311K reading, with experts predicting a figure around 240K. At the same time, the unemployment rate is expected to hold at 3.6%. How can investors react to the jobs data in real time with the most obvious avenue of trading closed? Currency Markets One possibility is to look at the foreign exchange market, which will remain open and live for trading. Data about the U.S. labor market will impact expectations about the country's economy and about the future of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. This, in turn, will spark movement in the dollar's value versus other major currencies. As a result, the U.S. dollar may find itself in the crosshairs as market participants decipher the latest round of jobs data. The potential impact is showcased by the last two jobs reports, which sparked noticeable movements in the dollar index ( DXY ). On Feb. 3, the government issued U.S. nonfarm payrolls that came in well above consensus. As a result, DXY jumped 1.1% from 101.83 to 102.92. The next jobs release, which came out on March 10, contributed to a 0.5% fall in DXY, which fell from 105.13 to 104.58. The dollar index ( DXY ) represents the change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to a basket of currencies. However, investors can also opt to trade in individual currency pairs, with activity in foreign exchange market taking place 24 hours a day through the week on various exchanges throughout the world (although currency trading does close over the weekend). While trading in exchange traded funds takes place on the stock market, here are some other currency-related funds that can be used for research for investors preparing a currency play following the jobs release: Invesco DB USD Bullish ETF ( UUP ) WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund ( USDU ) Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund ( UDN ) Invesco CurrencyShares Euro Trust ( FXE ) Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust ( FXY ) Invesco CurrencyShares Swiss Franc Trust ( FXF ) Invesco CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust ( FXA ) Invesco CurrencyShares British Pound Sterling Trust ( FXB ) Futures Trading The Good Friday holiday will also impact futures trading. However, various Treasury note and equity futures will remain active as the jobs data comes out at 8:30 a.m. ET. (And while the bond market closes early Thursday the Securities and Financial Markets Association recommends an early close Friday rather than a full holiday due to the jobs data.) According to the CME, trading in Treasury futures will close at 10:15 a.m. CT, or 11:15 a.m. ET, leaving multiple hours of post-jobs release action. Meanwhile, e-mini S&P 500 futures will close at 8:15 a.m. CT, or 9:15 a.m. ET -- 45 minutes after the data comes out. Cryptocurrency Trading Investors can also turn to the cryptocurrency market, which operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. While cryptos don't relate directly to the payroll data, the market has often acted as a proxy for speculative assets in general. Perceptions about the future of interest rates and the health of the economy could fuel movement in digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). For example, in the hours before the March 10 jobs report, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reached a mark near $19.6K, touching its lowest level since January. However, following the release of the employment statistics, the cryptocurrency saw an upswing, with momentum carrying over through the next week and a half. By March 19, Bitcoin had topped $28K. Trader Beware While there are avenues to trade the jobs numbers, volume will be low and that can lead volatility and boosts risk in opening new positions. Investors should keep that in mind and may want to wait until futures trading Sunday evening or Monday's open before adjusting their portfolios or trades. Ahead of Friday's jobs report, ADP released its figures on March payrolls in the private sector. The data showed a rise of 145K jobs in the month, below the growth economists had predicted .",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3954223-how-to-trade-fridays-payrolls-report-with-markets-being-closed?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11456046.jpeg

42411167,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQJn,1680720232,"Happy 48th Birthday, Satoshi Nakamoto","Today we celebrate the creator of Bitcoin on Satoshi Nakamoto’s birthday. Happy birthday, Satoshi!  We don’t know who Satoshi is and we likely never will, but the pseudonymous founder does apparently have a birthday. Satoshi entered a birth date when they registered the pseudonym with The P2P Foundation. Satoshi’s birthday is, according to that registration, April 5, 1975. (For proof, Satoshi’s age showed up as 38 on The P2P Foundation on April 4, 2014, and as 40 on April 5, 2015, implying an April 5, 1975, birthday.)  Of course, the Bitcoin faithful have drawn up all sorts of theories about why Satoshi chose this date specifically – besides it actually being their real birthday.  One has to do with the anniversary of Executive Order 6102, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt banned the private ownership of gold on April 5, 1933. Americans handed over gold to the government and, with the Gold Reserve Act the following year, the gold content of the U.S. dollar was increased from $20 to $35 an ounce. Really, that was just a devaluation of the dollar because it now took more dollars to buy the exact same amount of gold.  Was Satoshi winking at us regarding the failure of a government-controlled money? Sure!  Satoshi’s birth year is apparently 1975, which is perhaps a salute to President Gerald Ford who repealed Executive Order 6102 in 1974. (It was effective on Dec. 31, 1974, which is basically 1975, but who’s counting?)  Satoshi winks, yet again.  On this particular birthday I want to shine a light on something else about Satoshi: Their real identity or identities. Was it Hal Finney? Nick Szabo? Adam Back? Len Sassaman? John Nash? Was it all of them together? Was it none of them and some other gallivanting group of cypherpunks?  No one knows, and it doesn’t matter.  At all.  Bitcoin is an open-source protocol that has outgrown a founder or founders. The fact that Satoshi stepped away from Bitcoin when it was hardly a toddler in 2011 only to have it grow into a $500 billion global money system elicits two thoughts: 1) Satoshi is a gracious founder who knew what Bitcoin would be, but only if the protocol was leaderless and 2) Bitcoin’s ascension to notoriety is basically a small miracle.  Who knows what Satoshi was thinking when they stepped away, but Bitcoin probably wouldn’t have come as far.  Would Bitcoin have become as important as it is if we knew who Satoshi was and we looked to them for guidance? Would Satoshi have supported Taproot? Segregated Witness? What about Ordinal non-fungible tokens?  Maybe, maybe not.  The point is that it doesn’t matter, Bitcoin belongs to everyone now. There is no leader. That might make some things messy, but at least it’s our mess. If it was revealed to us in a collective fever dream who Satoshi was, that person or persons would not be handed complete ownership over the project. If it were, there would be plenty of dissenters.  Bitcoin is rules without rulers.  So, happy birthday to you, Satoshi, wherever you may be. We love you but we don’t miss you.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/05/happy-48th-birthday-satoshi-nakamoto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6432edcaa70d6b386594e31192cc1c6f05dce049-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This comes as the crypto industry faces possibly its strongest regulatory pressure yet, with centralized exchanges feeling the brunt of it so far.

42411171,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQTi,1680717505,Is Chief Twit Elon Musk Also Top DOGE?,"So this is how mass adoption happens? Elon Musk, at least at one point the world’s richest man, replaced Twitter’s classic blue bird logo with a sprite of DOGE, the Shiba Inu dog known as much for the meme as the meme coin. Dogecoin spiked something like 40%, and hasn’t yet crashed. I hear there’s excitement brewing that DOGE could pump above the 10 cents threshold, which is proportionately one-tenth as exciting as when the so-called proletariat investors of the GameStop era attempted to drive dogecoin, sometimes un-ironically called “the people’s cryptocurrency,” past $1 (it didn’t work).  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Dogecoin is apparently spiking because people believe that Elon Musk could soon integrate a permanent dogecoin payment system on Twitter, the microblogging platform he overpaid for ($43 billion). Twitter has several million daily active users, many of them high-profile, and if even just a small percentage begin transacting in DOGE – as a joke or not – it’s not completely irrational to speculate on that translating into a higher price. Mind you, Twitter already has payment/tipping features using the U.S. dollar and the Bitcoin Lightning network. The latter is rarely used, which gives some indication of how frequently the even-less-widely adopted and even-less-trusted crypto, dogecoin, would (or wouldn’t) be used.  Of course, this is my attempt to ascribe meaning to crypto price moves. Prices are basically the only thing that matter in crypto, but rarely for any reason investors typically rely on when evaluating the expected return of an asset. Instead, crypto prices are almost a perfect reflection of market sentiment – or, to put it in the people’s language, vibe. The coronavirus shutting down the global economy? Bad vibes. Locked-down workers with excess cash turning into slap-happy day traders? Fun vibes. A massive stablecoin experiment crashing and burning? Bad vibes. The collapse of the U.S. banking revealing Bitcoin’s virtues? Apparently good vibes.  Elon Musk has manipulated the price of dogecoin in the past. The first time it happened, in early 2020, DOGE jumped after the Tesla founder tweeted out a meme. He apparently got a taste of something he enjoys – power through s**tposting – because he pulled similar moves again and again, each time raising the stakes as the joke grew stale. He weighed in on a dispute between DOGE traders and crypto exchange Binance. Tesla, his car company, would allow DOGE payments. Musk planned to bring DOGE to space, with a SpaceX satellite launch. Over 30-some tweets up to the end of 2022, Musk pumped the price of DOGE by 4.5% on average, according to crypto-skeptical news site Protos.  There’s speculation Musk may be a massive DOGE holder, though it’s unknown how much, if any, he owns. Investors in New York actually filed a racketeering lawsuit against Musk alleging he purposely drove up the price of DOGE by 36,000% (the evidence being his tweets and a ""Saturday Night Live"" appearance as host) only to short the crypto when it inevitably collapsed. On March 31, Musk’s lawyers asked to throw out the suit, saying his statements were too vague to be considered fraud.

Development on the project was stalled basically for years before people noted its out-of-date code base put users at risk. Riding the wave of a price jump, and Musk’s support, developers announced they were actually going to not only fix Dogecoin but revamp it, ultimately transitioning the network to proof-of-stake like Ethereum to position it as a genuine payment system for the web. Dogecoin developers have hinted that Chief Twit Musk even sat in on development calls as the Top Doge, and Musk has said the network has unique capabilities for micropayments.  Whether a working codebase and the support of one of the world’s most influential people is enough to propel DOGE into the hands of everyone remains to be seen. Of course, the vibes for crypto are way off since the collapse of the FTX exchange. And most of the “chattering class” is sick of Musk because of the media saturation, especially now that Twitter’s internal chaos spills out into the news nearly every week. Musk’s scatterbrained leadership at Twitter has even weakened support among his base of TSLA stock owners and space nerds, showing that Musk’s brand of creative-destruction may actually just be destructive.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/05/is-chief-twit-elon-musk-also-top-doge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcdecbd7a91e7f901ce9148342d604e41ef84901-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421266,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmJx,1680717072,USDC Boasted Transparency but It Didn't Help When Silicon Valley Bank Got Into Trouble,"The weekend of March 10, 2023, was a profound test of how well stablecoins hold up under pressure. Now that everything has settled, some odd lessons have been passed on, namely: Transparency doesn't seem to be a good thing. And forget about prudent management of reserves – it's just not worth it.  Opacity and sloppy reserve management win the day. Or, at least, so it would appear.  Leading up to Friday, March 10, the issuer of second-largest stablecoin USD coin (USDC), Circle, was probably the industry's most transparent issuer.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  It provided daily updates to investors through its BlackRock-managed money market fund, which backstops the stablecoin. On top of that, Circle had just adopted the New York Department of Financial Services’ guidance for stablecoin transparency, which required two attestation-of-reserves tests each month.  In contrast, Circle’s arch-competitor, Tether, which publishes attestation reports on a less-frequent quarterly basis, lagged far behind on transparency.  To boot, in its attestation reports Circle disclosed all sorts of useful information to users, such as each individual Treasury bill’s CUSIP number and where it banks. On that list was Silicon Valley Bank.  It was the last bit of data – Circle's banking relationships – that seems to have caught everyone's attention that Friday. After experiencing a run through most of the week, Silicon Valley Bank shares were halted at 9:30 a.m. local time after plunging 62% in premarket trading. Just before noon, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that it would be shutting the bank down.  Keen-eyed social media commentators scanning Circle's disclosures noticed the mention of deposits held at Silicon Valley Bank. Tweets were issued.  Read more: Anna Baydakova - Why Stablecoin USDC’s Unstable Weekend Matters  They certainly had cause for concern. When a bank fails and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) takes it over, depositors are only protected up to $250,000 per account. Anything above that amount is at risk. The implication was that if Circle had funds stuck at Silicon Valley Bank, it could suffer big losses. That meant potentially being insolvent. And that raised the possibility that USDC holders might not be made whole.  Social media began to demand a statement out of Circle. CoinDesk picked up on Circle's Silicon Valley Bank problem after lunch. Curve's massive 3pool, an important source of stablecoin liquidity, began to be drained as fearful traders swapped their USDC for USDT. By that evening, 3pool was empty and Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, suspended 1:1 conversions between Binance USD (BUSD) and USDC, indicating a significant amount of stress in the market.  By 7 p.m. ET, a slight USDC depegging from the U.S. dollar occurred on trading markets, and after 10 p.m. Circle finally issued a statement. It revealed that $3.3 billion of USDC’s reserves was in limbo at Silicon Valley Bank. The market was stunned. USDC's price began a sickening plunge to below 90 cents.  The irony of this is that neither of Circle's competitors, Tether and Paxos, disclose where they bank. And so commentators on social media didn't have enough dirt on Tether and Paxos to start asking questions. While USDC collapsed on exchanges, the prices of the Tether and Paxos stablecoins held solid.  Read more: JP Koning - How Tether Can Be a More Stable Stablecoin  Had Circle been as opaque as its competitors, no one would have known that Silicon Valley Bank was its banker and the weekend run on USDC probably would never have occurred.  The lesson would seem to be: Don't be transparent or, if you need to be transparent, don't be transparent about your shortcomings.  How might Circle have managed its reserves differently?  Paxos, which issues the Paxos dollar (USDP) stablecoin and, until recently, BUSD, offers some cues. According to the Paxos attestation reports on USDP, Paxos keeps hundreds of millions worth of deposits with banks, but all of those deposits are insured.  It bypasses the $250,000 limit in two ways.  First, some of Paxos' deposits are invested through placement networks. The way this works is that Paxos' bank farms money out to other partner banks in $250,000 blocks. Each of these blocks is completely covered by FDIC insurance. Although there are 4,333 FDIC-insured banks in the U.S., providing a theoretical coverage ceiling of $1.08 billion, in practice Paxos only uses deposit networks for part of its deposit balance.  For the remaining unprotected part, Paxos has contracted with an insurance company to be covered by private deposit insurance. Of the $270 million in cash reserves used to back USDP going into the crisis, $72 million was privately insured.  And that, folks, is how to prudently manage large cash balances. It's a pain. You can't just casually stash your billions at a bank; you've got to go out of your way to properly secure it.  Circle was the largest beneficiary of the bailout.  Which leads us into the second irony. If it didn't pay for Circle to be transparent, it also didn't pay for Paxos to be prudent.  On Sunday evening, March 12, the FDIC announced that the $250,000 limit on insurance would be waived. All deposits held at Silicon Valley Bank would be extended a blanket guarantee. Circle's $3.3 billion was safe. In moments, the price of USDC rocketed back up to its $1 peg.  The crypto sector had just benefited from its first federal bailout, and not a small one at that. According to FDIC, the 10 largest deposit accounts at Silicon Valley Bank held a combined $13.3 billion, implying that Circle was the largest beneficiary of the bailout.  The moral of this part of the story is that the government's official cap of $250,000 was never very serious; unofficially, FDIC protects everything. Paxos' careful deployment of private insurance and deposits networks seems to have been a waste of time and resources, and its competitors' ""don't think, just deposit"" strategy the right one.  In the aftermath, Circle now advertises USDC as ""a stablecoin with GSIB cash."" That means no longer keeping a big chunk of its cash reserves at mid-size banks like Silicon Valley Bank but lodging most of it at Bank of New York Mellon, a global systemically important bank, one almost certain to benefit from a bailout should it fail. That also means Circle probably won’t bother going through the process of negotiating private deposit insurance.  As for Tether, which issues the least transparent of the big stablecoins going into March 10, it wasn't terribly prudent, either. Its public attestation reports give no indication that it routes its $5 billion or so in cash through deposit networks, nor does it resort to non-FDIC insurance. It fully absorbs the risk of its bankers going bust.  Yet, the amount of USDT in circulation has exploded by around $9 billion, or 11%, since that weekend.  On a long enough timeline, another significant stablecoin test, like the one that faced USDC, is inevitable. The reasons for the next one will be difficult to predict, and likely different from the last one. While opacity and a nonchalant approach to reserve management may not have been punished this time around (indeed, they seem to have been rewarded), if issuers internalize these lessons, then the next stablecoin crisis will only come sooner, and at a much larger scale.",NEGATIVE,USDT | USDC,FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | USDC,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/05/usdc-boasted-transparency-but-it-didnt-help-when-silicon-valley-bank-got-into-trouble,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1389229b8ec568a50350939c21ecc1d11d8da8e0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387756,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQsO6V,1680715472,Inventor of Ethereum’s ERC-20 Token Standard Plans New Blockchain ‘LUKSO’ for Creative Types,"Fabian Vogelsteller, an Ethereum veteran who helped shape the ecosystem in the early days, is taking on a new venture – a blockchain to succeed where he says others have failed, in catering to creative, fashion-oriented and art-world types.  One of the 39-year-old, self-taught German programmer’s most significant contributions to Ethereum was the invention of ERC-20, the blueprint for creating tokens that are compatible with the blockchain. That innovation led to the infamous initial coin offering boom of 2017-2018. Several of the biggest tokens by market capitalization are based on the standard, including Uniswap’s UNI, Shiba Inu’s SHIB and Arbitrum’s new ARB.  Vogelsteller is now turning his attention to a new project, LUKSO, a soon-to-be-launched layer 1 blockchain that he says is designed for the “creative economy.” It would compete with Ethereum itself, by far the dominant smart-contracts blockchain with a market capitalization of $217 billion.  The explosion in NFTs for everything from collectibles to art and music, along with a plethora of imagined metaverses, is a good reflection of the potential for creative-type applications on the blockchain, according to Vogelsteller. But he says the systems are nowhere near maturity and not easy enough to use.  “One of the advantages for starting a new network was thinking about how we can improve the basic direction of the blockchain,” Vogelsteller told CoinDesk.  LUKSO will have a window of opportunity for validators to join the network. There will be a Genesis Validator Deposit Smart Contract on the Ethereum blockchain, which will go live in a few weeks.  Just like Ethereum was born out of Bitcoin, LUKSO will be born out of Ethereum, Vogelsteller told CoinDesk: “We use Ethereum as an on-ramp in a way, like Ethereum used the Bitcoin network.”  On LUKSO, the Genesis Validator Deposit Smart Contract will allow users to deposit LYXe, an ERC-20 token that went live in a reversible ICO round in June 2020, to become a genesis validator. (Once the mainnet goes live, LYXe will be converted to LYX, the native token for LUKSO.)  Each validator on the LUKSO blockchain needs to lock up 32 LYXe in order to participate in the block validation process – similar to the 32 ETH that’s required to be “staked” on Ethereum to participate as a validator.  Self-taught coder  According to Vogelsteller, what’s stopping Ethereum from becoming adopted on a mass scale is that the applications aren't making the user experience easy. It’s hard for the average person to understand what address belongs to which wallet, and it takes effort to follow the movement of transactions on the chain. To solve this, LUKSO will introduce a comprehensive all-in-one profile that brings on-chain activity under a single entity, known as a “universal profile.”  Vogelsteller was born in the tiny German town of Unterwirbach in Bavaria where he says he never really fit in. He moved to another small city in southwest Germany where he finished his studies at Schmalkalden. He studied media design at the Bauhaus University in Weimar.  “I never studied computer science or anything technical. Everything I know I learned by myself coding websites since I was 14,” Vogelsteller said.  In 2013, Vogelsteller first learned about blockchains. He also happened to meet the original Ethereum team a day before their pre-sale. Six months later, Vogesteller started working for the Ethereum Foundation in Berlin, where he built the first Web3 browser, the first Ethereum wallet and other developer tools.  During his time at the Ethereum Foundation, Vogelsteller, together with Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, pioneered ERC-20, which created a set of rules that tokens on Ethereum blockchain have to adhere to, making it easier for developers to know how any new ERC-20 token will behave.  Buterin had originally proposed an initial token standard in 2015, but Vogelsteller looked at the proposal, changed a few things and proposed ERC-20 to the Ethereum community to initiate a conversation. It was adopted in September 2017 and remains the de facto standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum.  Vogelsteller also first introduced the concept of a blockchain-based identity on Ethereum in 2017, known as ERC-725. It gave protocols the ability to create decentralized identity standards on Ethereum. While the Ethereum standard didn't take off like ERC-20 did, projects like Origin Protocol implemented the standard.  Leaving Ethereum  By 2018, Vogelsteller left the Ethereum Foundation to focus on LUKSO and improve on standards that he proposed during his time working on the Ethereum blockchain.  Now, Vogelsteller has drawn inspiration from the decentralized blockchain identity standard he created for Ethereum, but has turned that into a series of LUKSO Standard Proposals, or LSPs, and the blockchain account at the heart of the ecosystem known as LSP0.  LSP0, which turns ERC-725 into a smart contract-based profile, tackles the functionality and makes profiles more user friendly on the blockchain. It combines a crypto type wallet, similar to an Ethereum account, with smart-contract storage. In addition to having a regular crypto account attached to these profiles, users can link to any public information they want, like their Twitter account or non-fungible tokens.  On LUKSO, users, organizations and teams can create any profile they wish to identify themselves as in Web3; the profile also would act as their blockchain account, making the user experience more seamless.  ‘Way more’ than a wallet  On Ethereum, if you hold a regular account, known as an ""externally owned account,"" it’s impossible to add information like the user’s name, age or other information to the public key address, meaning aspects of identity cannot be integrated into the protocol layer.  And while crypto users often enjoy using aliases or being anonymous, having easy ways to identify what a user presents themselves online with their on-chain activity is missing. Vogelsteller believes that universal profiles solve this.  “It can be a wallet, but it's way more than that,” Vogelsteller told CoinDesk. “It is a whole profile. It has a name. It has a picture. It can be managed by multiple devices, by multiple keys, with different levels of permission.”  The universal profiles also get ""key managers,"" which can let users add multiple keys to their on-chain account that are assigned or execute different actions. The key manager checks which key can do what on the universal profile and can restrict specific activities of certain devices. In addition, having these multiple keys enables some kind of backup system in the event that a user loses access to a key.  There could be benefits for decentralized autonomous organizations, online stores, services or anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer processes required by authorities; organizations are able to store, use and cross-check the public information of a universal profile.  The idea of LUKSO is to become a whole ecosystem for creatives. Vogelsteller said LUKSO is “building a whole toolset and ecosystem and marketplace around NFTs using universal profile on the base,” making it easier to identify creatives and their profiles, and their works on the blockchain.  While the hype these days seems to be around “layer 2” scaling tools for Ethereum, Vogesteller argues that LUKSO needed to be its own network.  New token standards  He argues that the network capacity of these popular layer 2s and Ethereum is full. “Mainnet is full, and it's expensive,"" he said.  LUKSO isn't the first blockchain to work on identity issues. Ethereum scaling project Polygon recently came out with Polygon ID, which uses zero-knowledge technology that allows users to verify their identities without revealing sensitive information. Other protocols like Ethereum Name Service exist to help connect domain names to users’ wallet addresses, making crypto addresses more identifiable.  “When you put the profile on the blockchain, everything you do now with your profile is literally happening on the blockchain. So there's a lot more things you can do now,” Vogelsteller said.

Whale Transfers Over 70,000 ETH To Exchange","While Ethereum (ETH) has tread carefully amid the various sentiments about the crypto market, a large investor seems to be close to dumping its ETH holdings on the market. Earlier today, the on-chain analysis platform Lookonchain revealed some enormous transactions going on behind the scene of Ethereum. According to the analysis platform, over 70,000 ETH was seen transferred to the popular crypto exchange Bitfinex hot wallet nearly six hours ago. Regardless, Ethereum still trades above $1,900 which indicates the whale may not have made any decision yet with the transferred Ether. Over 70,000 Transferred To Exchange, Why? In one of its Twitter posts posted earlier today, Lookonchain noted an Ethereum whale with the address “0x8033” transferred 75,311 ETH worth $144 million to Bitfinex exchange Hot Wallet. Though, the whale’s move on sending the ETH is still unknown, however, it could be a possible sell-off. Related Reading: Experts Expect Ethereum (ETH) To Break $2,000 Shortly, Here’s Why According to Lookonchain, the same whale received 76,212 ETH from Bitfinex on January 5 in 2019, when ETH still had a market price of around $156. The whale eventually deposited 900 ETH into Tornado Cash on December 6, 2020. Despite the whale’s unknown pending decision, It is worth noting that the whale might be looking to take profits, which means selling all of the over 70,000 ETH sent to the Bitfinex exchange. This is because, in the crypto market, a large amount of deposit of an asset to exchange may indicate an upcoming selling pressure as exchanges are where most large investors go to sell their holdings of an asset. Massive Dip Incoming For Ethereum? Though as earlier stated, this news could mean a possible large sell-off of ETH is about to take place in the Ethereum market. However, looking at the ETH price chart, the asset does not seem to show any upcoming plummet, from a technical perspective. On the 1-day chart, ETH now seems to be looking to break above a notable high which is just above the $2,000 region.

In Citi's latest “Money, Tokens, and Games” report, the banking giant said the crypto industry is reaching an inflection point where blockchain's potential will be seen and measured in “billions of users” coupled with “trillions of dollars in value.”  That, however, could hinge on whether the use of CBDCs globally becomes a reality. By 2030, according to the Citi report, up to $5 trillion worth of CBDCs could be circulating in major economies across the world, half of which would be tied to distributed ledger technology.  “CBDCs will be a Trojan horse,” Ghose told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday, referring to how using the digital currency will get more people comfortable using blockchain. The original, wooden Trojan horse was used by the Greeks to breach the defenses of the city of Troy during the Trojan War.  Ghose said CBDCs will push “the adoption in financial services of tokenized assets [and] tokenized money.”  The use of CBDCs is likely to vary by region and use cases, said Ghose. China, for instance, is a country likely to take a more centralized approach in its use of a CBDC.  Still, Ghose said, blockchain technology “has a real value when you’re looking at fragmented systems” and some countries, such as India, could benefit from cross-border CBDCs.  From the retail user’s perspective  Ghose predicts the three drivers for blockchain technology will be CBDCs, securities and tokenized assets in gaming.  “That's what's going to drive the growth of blockchain adoption in the next three to five years,” he said.  Adoption of blockchain will be helped greatly by what users already know – digital wallets, such as Apple Pay, according to Ghose.  Gaming will also be a serious catalyst for the technology, Ghose said. He expects blockchain-based gaming tokens will “take off in the next two or three years.”  Read more: UAE Unveils CBDC Strategy, First Phase to Be Completed by Mid-2024",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/05/citi-analyst-cbdcs-will-be-a-trojan-horse-for-blockchain-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fa06d10042422ca8d5b6c9dda7ebcc522bd1595-2947x1658.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance wasn’t interested because of rumors that Huobi has ties to mainland China, which Binance wants nothing to do with, according to the person, who requested anonymity. In an interview last month with CoinDesk TV, Sun said Huobi wants to attain a license in Hong Kong and launch a new exchange there called Huobi Hong Kong.  The scope of Sun’s involvement with Huobi has been cloaked in secrecy. A company called About Capital purchased Huobi in October of last year. Sun’s representatives have said he’s not involved with About, though Huobi confirmed in January that he’s a leader of the company. Last week, following a Bloomberg report that Sun was trying to sell his Huobi stake, he compared such speculation to an April Fool’s joke.  Binance has been led to believe that Sun owns a majority stake in Huobi, the person said.  Sun’s overture was made directly to Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao in the last week or so, the person said.  “I must point out that in the past week or so, I have not proposed any offer to [CZ] regarding the purchase of [Huobi], nor have we even discussed Huobi in the past week or so,“ Sun tweeted after this story came out.  “We don’t have any comment to share,“ a Binance spokesperson said.  The price of Tron’s TRX token fell to its lowest price of the past 24 hours after this story was initially published, according to CoinDesk data.

Following a week-long bullish run, Ethereum’s price has reached an eight-month high, hovering just below the $2,000 mark. The surge can be attributed to the upcoming Shanghai hard fork upgrade, set to launch on April 12. The upgrade will primarily allow validators to withdraw staked coins, increasing liquidity and boosting demand. Related Reading: This Could Be The Next Target For Solana As Price Turns Bullish This has led to a significant increase in buyers’ activity in the market, positively affecting demand and accumulation. While major altcoins are also extending gains with Bitcoin, Ethereum needs to break above the crucial $2,000 level to sustain its rally. However, a correction now could threaten ETH’s positive momentum and cause it to fall below the current support level. The market capitalization of Ethereum also appreciated suggesting an increase in demand. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $1,910. The bulls successfully broke through a crucial price resistance level of $1,860, which has now become a support level for the altcoin. The overhead price ceiling for ETH was set at $1,930. If breached, the altcoin could attempt to revisit the $1,970 price mark. However, it is important to note that this level can act as a strong price ceiling for the altcoin but if broken, Ethereum could soar above $2,000. On the other hand, the first support level for the coin is currently at $1,860. In the event of a price correction, Ethereum will drop to $1,860. In case ETH fails to maintain that level, it could plunge to $1,840. The amount of ETH traded in the last session was green, displaying the presence of buyers at the time of writing. Technical Analysis Buyers began to show confidence in the price movement as ETH attempted to approach $2,000. This was demonstrated by the Relative Strength Index climbing above the 60-mark. The reading indicated that buyers held a firm grip on the asset in the market. Additionally, the price of ETH rose above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, reflecting a significant surge in demand and indicating that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. If ETH manages to breach the next two critical resistance levels, it is expected to experience another price surge, which will further drive up demand for the asset. As demand for Ethereum surged on the chart, buy signals began to emerge for the altcoin. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which measures price momentum and reversals, turned green, indicating buy signals for the asset. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Forms A Falling Wedge Pattern, Can Price Touch $0.11 Furthermore, the Directional Movement was positive, indicating that the price was moving in a bullish direction, with the +DI line (blue) situated above the -DI line (orange).

42421276,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmVJ,1680710400,Crypto Investors: Why You Need to Understand Layer 1 Protocols,"As we discussed last week, the first quarter was a great time for cryptocurrency prices, but a terrible time for sentiment about the industry. I’d like to expound on the latter point, given that crypto is clearly in the crosshairs of regulators and politicians – including some who seem to not want this sector to exist at all.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) tweet about building an “anti-crypto army” is one of the more pronounced indications of that sentiment. CoinDesk has actually seen fit to recently post two editorials regarding the federal government’s crackdown on crypto and the Biden administration’s politicizing of it. I’ve voiced my own belief that bad actors, not the asset, should be the target.  But instead of critiquing the critics, I’d rather talk about what drew me into crypto, which is illustrative. My initial interest in 2018 was based on speculative interest, which may be dirty words to many. Why is speculation spoken of in the pejorative? I don’t know anyone who deploys capital with the expectation that it will decrease in value. If you are that person, feel free to just pass your asset on to me and I can hold onto it for you.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Here are the questions I asked myself when crypto got on my radar:  “What is this new thing that I’m hearing about?”  “What does it do?”  “How can I learn more about it?”  Intellectual curiosity, the desire to generate wealth and a goal to increase my knowledge of a nascent technology led me to bitcoin (BTC). In hindsight, though, it wasn’t just bitcoin. It was the concept of layer 1 blockchains, because ultimately that’s what we are accessing: space on a blockchain.  The value of a layer 1, or L1, network comes from people conducting peer-to-peer transactions with that blockchain. The native token of any given blockchain – BTC in the case of Bitcoin – acts as an incentive mechanism to get people to ensure that the data stored on the blockchain is secure and accurate.  The value is especially relevant in areas of the world where central bankers have caused local currencies to hyperinflate. One of the mistakes being made by U.S. lawmakers and regulators is looking at cryptocurrencies from a U.S.-centric perspective only.  It appears regulators don’t care about the functionality or reliability of blockchains, especially as some of the loudest opponents of crypto are in favor of central bank digital currencies – a type of digital currency issued by a central bank. The animosity feels more related to the decentralized nature of crypto – the ability to take fiat currency and exchange it for another asset of value, without the need for a central body (central banks, regulators, politicians, conventional banks, etc.).  Here are some of the larger layer 1 protocols and their recent performance:  The performance runs the gamut from impressive to anything but, which is how it probably should be. On a technical level, BTC is correlated most to ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, with its lowest correlation being to crypto exchange Binance’s BNB token.  What I find intriguing about layer 1s is the nuance that exists between them. As one L1 comes into existence, another attempts to improve upon it on the basis of speed, scalability, etc. For instance, I am admittedly anchored to Bitcoin. Its foundation as a peer-to-peer network gives it a first-mover advantage and the largest market share.  The ability to develop smart contracts on top of the Ethereum blockchain, where predetermined conditions are met and executed via code, is another facet that I find value in.  In many ways, crypto forces someone focused on assets and prices to level up on technology, while the tech-focused person is incentivized to get up to speed on market dynamics. The discipline of tech and the discipline of assets are pulled together, much in the way that code links tasks within a smart contract.  In my own experience, doing so caused me to uncover differences between blockchains. For example, Avalanche uses a “heterogeneous network of blockchains.” Rather than all applications occurring in one blockchain, Avalanche uses an Exchange (“X”) Chain, Platform (“P”) Chain and Contract (“C”) Chain. In doing so, the goal is to increase scalability and reduce fees, things the Ethereum blockchain has struggled with.  Asset ownership is important. It makes little to no sense to ignore a burgeoning technology, unless you want to be completely left behind. If people can engage in peer-to-peer transactions while having complete confidence in their accuracy, and not having to compensate a third party, they will do so.  L1s are at the base of the crypto economy and should be understood and be used as a base network for applications. And, yes, sometimes even used to generate a profit, as well.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk’s Nick Baker, here’s some recent news worth reading:  THAT DOG: Sometimes crypto is about high-minded principles like breaking down barriers that keep many out of traditional banking or replacing obviously needlessly complex processes with more efficient smart contracts. And sometimes it’s about Elon Musk doing whatever he’s doing with dogecoin? That includes this week! Musk swapped out Twitter’s iconic bird logo for DOGE’s dog mascot, and DOGE’s price soared to a many-month high. This is not the kind of attention many in crypto want …  BITCOIN VIX: The VIX is well-known in traditional finance (TradFi) circles as a measure of the degree of fear in markets. In reality, it’s not exactly that; it simply reports what the implied volatility is for S&P 500 options. It doesn’t have to rise when worry is plentiful, though that is often what it does. There’s something resembling it in crypto: Deribit’s DVOL, which measures bitcoin’s implied volatility. It has soared this year while bitcoin has, too. Fear is not plentiful with BTC, and yet DVOL is up, flipping what’s expected of “fear gauges.” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole spoke with experts who think that’s made bitcoin call options more attractive than ever.  GETTING RICH: If you haven’t been paying attention to crypto prices but have been paying attention to what U.S. regulators are doing to the industry, you’d be forgiven for suspecting the prices of bitcoin and the rest of digital assets have been shooting straight toward zero. And yet they have not. Bitcoin has zoomed higher to start 2023, and the industry’s market capitalization has just hit a new high: $1.19 trillion, a level last seen in June. Markets can be weird.  AN EDITORIAL: CoinDesk generally doesn’t take a position on issues, preferring to cover the news straight and let readers decide what to think. We just made an exception, in an editorial written by Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds.

42421284,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmXN,1680710400,Web3 Experiential Tokens and Asset Pricing,"Web3 consumer engagement models are still developing and only just beginning to migrate into the real economy, but some hints of what the future of transaction and asset pricing may look like are beginning to emerge. To plot this trajectory, it is important to understand how Web3 consumer engagement will differ from the current Web2 world.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Today, exclusive access to transactional data is used to build and fuel network effects and is often also monetized through advertising. But Web3 lives on blockchains, where key transactional data is openly available. Incentivizing network effects in this realm may come down to encouraging the crowd to engage through strategies specifically designed to deliver emotional appeal.  Today, complex, multi-leg transactions require bespoke contracts and operational processes, people and systems to administer required activities. In Web3, smart contracts embed these contractual activities into a token and the terms self-execute when the right conditions are met. This is likely to reduce costs and enable more multi-leg transactions.  The ability to assign additional rights to a token-based transaction – such as the payout of royalties or community access or both – is likely to turn such transactions into “experiences” that have value beyond the initial purchase. “Experiential” tokens become assets that offer a dual purpose: They are both a key to access benefits and a financial instrument that can be valued in decentralized-finance transactions or in an investment portfolio.  Moreover, experiential tokens are transferrable. If the asset is sold, the rights and remaining value are reassigned to the new owner. Today, contracts would need to be renegotiated and redrawn to enable such a transfer. In Web3, the rights are reassigned as soon as the token moves from one to another wallet.  These attributes suggest the emergence of a new approach to valuation. As shown, we believe the value of an experiential token increases each time a more precise target audience is used to price the asset. Identification of the target audience can be done using blockchain transactional data.  (For illustrative purposes only. This chart represents Franklin Templeton’s view. There can be no assurance that these events or expectations will be realized. Actual results may be significantly different from that shown here.)  For example, in March 2022 two celebrity chefs dropped unique pizza-themed non-fungible tokens that offered digital art as well as access to a community connecting NFT owners with their favorite chefs through online Master classes and events – both virtual and in real life.The ongoing “value” of each NFT will be based on the perceived desirability and value of the art, community, classes and events that the token offers.  That value might look quite different if the token price were to be based on demand from the marketplace at large as compared to demand from a community of cooking enthusiasts, and potentially even higher if the audience valuing the token were specifically interested in the particular chefs.  Algorithms able to evaluate digital wallets and find addresses with a transaction history that aligns to desired attributes may be designed to advertise token sales and request bids and offers in an increasingly targeted manner. Valuations may be created through this type of solicitation process (request for quote) and perhaps even invitation-only auctions created to enable targeted exchange of NFTs.  Obtaining the highest potential valuation for a specific asset will be in the interest of institutional investors because this can help to increase the value of an institution’s broader set of related holdings. For example, the recent NFT sale of royalty rights to a famous singer’s song from 2015 raised slightly more than $60,000, but the success of the NFT drop may have helped to increase the value of the music catalog owned by the issuing platform.  While Web3 consumer engagement models are still in their infancy, we believe they have the potential to unlock incremental value and enable price discovery for creators and investors alike.

The company, to be called VitaTech, would leverage public funding to license longevity technologies developed in U.S. universities and support their continued development. The funds would come from research foundations and government grants such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR).  “To make up for [VitaDAO’s funding] shortfall, we are currently discussing a proposal to establish a for-profit US-based company that will bridge the gap between research and commercialization,” the collective tweeted.  The company will operate as a subsidiary or affiliate of VitaDAO.

The proposal will enter a 10-week execution phase between April 3 and June 12, 2023, if approved.

McCaul, a member of the ECB arm responsible for overseeing banks, said recent attempts to regulate crypto such as the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, or MiCA, wouldn’t fully address the problem of complex international structures, or the “ecosystem” companies that claim to have no headquarters.  “How can we supervise firms that have no physical borders?,” McCaul said. “We need to put more thought into imagining what international coordination will look like and how it can be effective in regulating the crypto world.”  McCaul cited precedents from banking, where consolidated groups are governed by “colleges” of international supervisors. She also noted that with securities, regulators defer to foreign jurisdictions that are deemed to be equivalent, but said that crypto companies would need to become more legally accountable.  “No jurisdiction should allow entities to run their business without disclosing their legal status and who is responsible for the business,” she said. “Even firms that claim to have no headquarters, such as Binance, need to be ‘supervisable’.”  While smaller entities could remain under MiCA, which is set to be made final by the European Parliament within weeks, McCaul said major crypto providers would need a separate regime with stricter requirements and enhanced supervision. The threshold for deeming an operator as ""significant"" also needs to shift, given that neither FTX nor Binance, two crypto exchanges, met the current criteria, she added.  Fabio Panetta, who sits on the ECB’s executive board, has previously described crypto as a “Ponzi scheme” fueled by greed.

Settles With Niagara Falls City to Resume Bitcoin Mining,"U.S. Bitcoin Corp has settled with the city of Niagara Falls in New York state, in a deal that will allow the mining firm to resume its bitcoin mining operations.  The 50-megawatt (MW) facility has been contentious due to noise complaints from residents. In early March, State Supreme Court judge Edward Pace ordered USBTC to stop operations at the Buffalo Ave. site and pay a $1 million fine.  The deal was passed by a 4-1 vote, according to a U.S. Bitcoin Corp spokesperson.  A company spokesperson confirmed the site, which has a computing power capacity of 1.1 exahashes/second (EH/s) has been shut down since then. Prior to the shutdown, USBTC said that 0.4 EH/s of self-mining was running at the site.  The deal expected to be voted on Wednesday by the city council will limit noise pollution from the facility to 65 decibels. Accommodations will include a ""noise dampening wall"" and an ""independent monitor"" that will keep tabs on the noise levels. USBTC will also have to comply with new zoning laws, which pertain to developing or buying renewable energy on par with their energy consumption; it will also pay $150,000 in compliance fees over the next 30 days.  The news was first reported by local media outlet Niagara Gazette.  The Buffalo Ave. facility is the smallest of four that USBTC operates. It also gained access to three more facilities during the Compute North bankruptcy proceedings; two of those it manages in conjunction with Generate Capital.  The firm's access to 680 MW of energy capacity after the Compute North bankruptcy garnered the attention of Canadian Hut 8 Mining (HUT), and the two are now going through an all-stock merger of equals. Hut 8, known for its strategy of retaining its produced bitcoin, has begun selling some its holdings to fund operations.  Asked as to whether the Niagara Falls issue could affect the merger, Erin Dermer, senior vice president of communications and culture at Hut 8, declined to comment.  When CoinDesk visited the town last year while the USBTC site was running, a humming could be heard in the vicinity. However, residents that CoinDesk spoke to were divided as to whether it was a problem.  A health worker at a rehab clinic less than a third of a mile from the site told CoinDesk that the noise it wasn't really an issue, except for once when they were doing counselling sessions outdoors. Another resident in the immediate vicinity said that at times it is annoying, but most of the time ""it is not that bad.""  But some who live further away have claimed that the facility is causing them to lose sleep.  Beverley, who lives about a quarter of a mile away, said she ""hasn't slept since it started"" operations and that to her, it feels like ""living in an airport."" Bryan Maacks, who lives about half a mile away, said to him the particular vibration is a constant throbbing hum that he cannot avoid in his own home, even with earplugs.

When you have a high percentage of uninsured deposits, and you don’t have liquidity management protocols in place, you end up in a place where you cannot open on Monday in a safe and sound manner.”  Signature was shuttered on March 12, two days after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and four days after Silvergate Bank announced it would close. All three banks were closely tied to the crypto industry. The closure of the banks, along with the Federal Reserve Board’s decision to reject crypto-friendly Custodia Bank’s membership application, has fueled theories that there is a coordinated effort among U.S. regulators to cut the crypto industry off from the banking system – popularly dubbed Operation Choke Point 2.0. That's a reference to an earlier effort by U.S. federal agencies to cut off legal but controversial businesses from banking services.  But Harris said Wednesday the idea that regulators are trying to de-bank crypto is “silly.”  “If you look at our rules, if you look at our guidance, they necessitate our virtual asset companies having a strong banking partnership with well-regulated banks,” Harris said. “So the idea that we don't want those banks to exist just doesn't make any logical sense.”  Harris added that her department’s rules – despite being considered onerous by some in the industry – have the benefit of providing a clear road map for crypto companies wishing to operate in New York.  “When you have rules on the books, when they are transparent, when it's in black and white, and everybody knows what they are, that is the best way,” Harris said. “And, frankly, it’s the fastest way to grow a robust and responsible ecosystem that can innovate, that can integrate with traditional financial services system, that can serve customers, and make our markets more efficient.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/05/nydfs-chief-dismisses-choke-point-20-theory-of-signatures-closure-as-ludicrous,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40779c62c0a0634b136bc8b65a0d05b3c9fc68eb-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11448576,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525729,1680706801,"Bitcoin Older Than 5 Years Abruptly Moves, Bearish Sign?","On-chain data shows a large amount of Bitcoin sitting dormant since between 5 and 7 years ago has moved recently, a sign that may be bearish for the price. 5+ Years Old 1,005 BTC Has Been Recently Moved On The Bitcoin Blockchain As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there is a possibility that this move could cause a drop in the price of the asset. The indicator of interest here is the “Spent Output Age Bands” (SOAB), which tells us about the amount of Bitcoin that each age band in the market is spending or moving on the chain currently. The “age bands” here refer to groups of coins divided based on the criteria of how much time they have been sitting still on the chain. For example, the 1-week to 1-month band includes all coins that haven’t moved from a single address since between one week and one month ago. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the SOAB data for most of the age bands in the Bitcoin market over the last few days: The respective movements of the different age bands in the network | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the highest spikes that the Bitcoin SOAB metric has registered during recent days have come from the 1-week to 1-month age band. This naturally makes sense, as a large amount of BTC supply constantly keeps churning without sitting still for too long due to trading activity and other reasons. Related Reading: Bitcoin SOPR Plunges, Why This Could Be Bullish A spike in the chart that stands out is the one from the 5-7 years age band, which took place a couple of days ago. This was an unusually large spike, as this group doesn’t tend to make too many moves. In total, about 1,005 BTC aged in this range were shifted on the blockchain during this spike. Investors that hold their coins for longer than six months are termed “long-term holders” (LTHs). This means that the holders responsible for this spike were a section of the LTHs. Statistically speaking, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. Because of this reason, LTHs are made up of the more resolute holders in the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flips Cardano In Market Cap, Becomes 7th Largest Crypto Since the coins that moved recently were on the older side for even the LTHs, it could be a sign that even the diamond hands of the network may be becoming tempted to sell at the current price levels. The exchange inflow SOAB, a modified version of the indicator that only tracks transactions going towards centralized exchanges, hasn’t yet registered any appreciable spikes from the 5-7 years cohort. The movements of the age bands going towards exchanges | Source: CryptoQuant Generally, investors use exchanges for selling, so if these coins didn’t move towards such platforms, there is a chance the movement wasn’t made for distribution after all. There is, however, still the possibility that the holders involved may just be selling through over-the-counter (OTC) deals, which, if true, could be bearish for the price. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,500, up 1% in the last week.

Across all spot and derivatives markets on the exchange, just two trades have been executed worth a total of $1.26 at press time.  OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb told CoinDesk that the lack of liquidity is because there are no internal market makers for the exchange and its not giving preference to external market makers. Lamb added that a public marketing program will be rolled out to spur liquidity.  It remains unclear whether the exchange has suffered issues with enlisting new customers or whether the issue is a lack of demand.  The exchange was co-founded by Davies and Zhu, alongside executives of troubled exchange CoinFLEX.  Zhu said in a tweet on Tuesday that liquidity will be built ""brick by brick"" and that the exchange was learning from the failure of crypto exchange FTX by avoiding having internal market makers.  It's worth noting that the tokenized bankruptcy claim feature, which will let users cash in a range of crypto-related claims, isn't live yet.

42387753,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQsNnn,1680703200,MEV Blocker Wants to Help You Outrun the Front-Runners,"A consortium of Ethereum builders has banded together to launch MEV Blocker, a utility that promises to help people transact on Etheruem without succumbing to maximal extractable value (MEV) bots.  Maximum extractable value is a phenomenon wherein clever blockchain operators profit from the ability for anyone to preview upcoming transactions. By looking at Ethereum’s mempool – a sort of waiting area for yet-to-be-confirmed transactions – so-called MEV-bots can front-run trades and execute other strategies, like sandwich attacks, that eat into the profits of regular users.  Read more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?  MEV-Boost – a piece of MEV-optimizing middleware used by virtually all the validators that operate Ethereum – aimed to spread out the riches of MEV to more people, but it also turned MEV-extraction into a kind of cottage industry. By MEV Blocker’s estimate, MEV bots have siphoned more than $1.38 billion from everyday Ethereum users so far.  MEV Blocker joins a growing number of projects that provide custom RPC endpoints to users that want to avoid being sniped by MEV extractors (an RPC endpoint is a gateway that wallets and other crypto apps use to communicate with a blockchain).  With its endpoint, MEV-Blocker aims to give power back to regular users – providing them a way to not just circumvent the most common MEV attacks, but also to profit from less offensive MEV strategies. It was jointly created by CoW Protocol, Beaver Build and Agnostic Relay – some of the larger players in Ethereum’s MEV ecosystem.  “MEV Blocker works by directing transactions to a network of ‘searchers’ before sending them to the mempool,” the team behind MEV Blocker explained in a statement. “The searchers then bid for the right to back-run the transactions while simultaneously shielding users from front-running and sandwich attacks.”  Back-running is a type of MEV strategy where a transaction is slipped in directly after another trade, with the back-running transaction taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities raised by the preceding transaction. According to MEV Blocker, their utility will reward “at least 90% of the profits from winning bids back to users,” with the other 10% going to validators.  MEV Blocker should be supported by all wallets that allow for custom RPC endpoints.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/05/mev-blocker-wants-to-help-you-outrun-the-frontrunners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55073b44fdfc339f89216f808a4ac6d6bbdef89f-1020x574.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Today’s announcement states that MicroStrategy, along with its affiliates, acquired approximately 1,045 Bitcoins for approximately $29.3 million in cash between March 24, 2023 and April 4, 2023. As of April 4, 2023, MicroStrategy, together with its subsidiaries, owned a total of approximately 140,000 Bitcoins acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.17 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $29,803 per Bitcoin, including fees and expenses. Thus, the breakeven point for Saylor and MicroStrategy is only a BTC price increase of about 6% away. Nevertheless, Saylor has always emphasized in the past that MicroStrategy does not plan not sell BTC in the near future.

The M^ZERO platform, helmed by players with backgrounds in both traditional finance and decentralized communities such as MakerDAO, will be taking an institutional-grade approach to DeFi.  The seed round was led by Pantera Capital, with participation from Road Capital, AirTree, Standard Crypto, The SALT Fund (part of the SkyBridge/Anthony Scaramucci family), ParaFi Capital, Distributed Capital, Kraynos Capital, Earlybird, and Mouro Capital (the venture capital arm connected to the Santander Group).  In the wake of last year’s collapses and bankruptcies of “centralized finance” firms, DeFi is steadily evolving to become more institutional-friendly and scalable. Luca Prosperi, CEO of M^ZERO Labs, said the protocol aims to do for institutional value transmission what others in the past have done to create a neutral infrastructure for payments to flow.  “You can think about M^ZERO as an infrastructural overlay on Ethereum, where large providers of assets and liquidity around the world can exchange value, and builders can create solutions,” Prosperi said in an interview. “Virtuous governance will be crucial for this, and we are developing the rules and code for this to be as decentralized as possible from day zero.”  Prosperi, who was one of the leading voices within the MakerDAO community, said M^ZERO will probably have a governance token, but its initial distribution could target large and sophisticated institutions rather than the general public. The infrastructure will have an open architecture, potentially acting as a connector to some existing DeFi platforms, he said.  “We are researching the development of a decentralized protocol, but the decentralized governance that we have in mind will be significantly different from the model based on airdrops, open Discord channels or forums, and anonymous participation,” he said. “You could think about it as a consortium of sophisticated parties rather than a [decentralized autonomous organization] in that sense.”  In addition to Prosperi, M^ZERO's founding team includes MakerDAO's former head of business development Greg Di Prisco and Oliver Schimek, previously CEO at fintech company CrossLend.  In terms of a timeline, the M^ZERO platform aims to go live by the end of this year.  “What Visa, Mastercard and American Express have done for payments, M^ZERO wants to do to value distribution,” said Paul Veradittakit, Managing Partner at Pantera Capital in a statement. “It will be an open-source, credibly neutral protocol where providers of liquidity and collateral can freely meet in a decentralized market on blockchain rails.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MKR,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/05/next-generation-defi-platform-mzero-emerges-from-stealth-with-225m-funding-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e97a751a652645db0ed4ca7165719b161a61bb5-2464x1386.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum Sharks Are Currently Holding Their Highest Amount In A Year According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the sharks have been constantly adding to their holdings since last summer. The relevant indicator here is the “ETH Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the data related to the total Ethereum supply being held by each wallet group in the market. Wallets are divided into these wallet groups based on the total number of coins that are currently sitting in their balances. The 10 -100 coins group, for instance, includes all addresses that are holding between 10 and 100 ETH. When the Supply Distribution metric is applied to this specific cohort, it will tell us about the total number of coins such investors as a whole are holding right now, as well as what percentage of the total ETH supply is being contributed by these combined holdings. In the context of the current discussion, the investor group of interest is made up of the “sharks,” who are entities that hold at least 100 and at most 10,000 ETH. At the current exchange rate, this range converts to about $191,000 at the lower bound and $19,100,000 at the upper end. As these amounts are quite significant, the sharks make up an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem. Their movements can, therefore, be worth watching as they may have visible influences on the price (though, not as much as the movement of the whales). Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Could Break At Least $33,000 In This Rally Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for these Ethereum sharks over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has gone up in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Supply Distribution of the sharks has been riding an uptrend for quite a while now. In the last nine months, these investors have accumulated a total of 2.27 million ETH, about $4.3 billion at the current price. From the chart, it’s also visible that with the buying spree over this period, these investors have added 1.4% of the total Ethereum supply to their combined wallets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flips Cardano In Market Cap, Becomes 7th Largest Crypto Just earlier in the year, this cohort faltered a little as some selling took place when the price of the cryptocurrency was at relatively high levels. This can be seen in the graph with the depression in the curve of the sharks’ supply. Recently, however, these Ethereum holders have once again sharply accumulated more of the asset and have taken their supply to the highest level in more than a year. Generally, accumulation from the sharks can be a bullish sign for the price of the coin. And indeed, as this fresh buying from them has taken place recently, the asset has been climbing and has now breached the $1,900 level for the first time since August 2022.

The monthly burn rate continues to be abysmal for SHIB, with the metric decreasing by nearly 76%. At $0.00001106, Can SHIB Hold For A Big Upside? The token’s current price point holds the key to higher price action in the coming days. However, investors should continue to accumulate in the coming days, which may or may not happen.

With the whales entering the scene, this burden might be lower for the bulls. However, with SHIB being one of the most traded tokens for whales, this could mean that whenever a whale accumulates, another whale dumps their holdings into the open market. This provides a stagnant price range for SHIB which leaves it in danger of a bigger downside.

42387770,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQsP0d,1680696486,First Mover Americas: Ether Rising Ahead of Upgrade,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Ether jumped to a nine-month high on Wednesday as an upcoming software upgrade on the Ethereum network is prompting investors and traders to funnel capital to ether and to other staking-focused tokens. Ether was up 5% to $1,920 in the past 24 hours, making it a top performer among major tokens. The token has reached its highest price since last August, CoinDesk data shows. The interest in ether comes ahead of Shapella, a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two major Ethereum network upgrades that are expected to occur simultaneously on April 12.  PostFinance, Switzerland’s fifth-largest financial-services firm, says it will offer access to cryptocurrencies to its customers, thanks to a partnership with regulated digital-asset-services provider Sygnum Bank. PostFinance, which is owned by the Swiss government, will allow its 2.5 million customers to buy, store and sell bitcoin and ether, with more crypto tokens to be added in the future. Switzerland stands in contrast to the U.S., where stamping crypto out seems to be the end goal.  Paxful, a peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform that's widely used in Africa, has suspended operations. But Paxful co-founder Ray Youssef is already trying to rally support for a new platform called Civilization Kit, or Civ Kit – a decentralized peer-to-peer bitcoin trading app built on Nostr, a decentralized social-media app that's backed by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. A white paper for Civ Kit will be released in one or two weeks, according to Youssef, who added that he plans to rally the Bitcoin community to help build and fund the project. For now, Paxful is encouraging users to move funds to non-custodial wallets or other platforms like the newly created Noones peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace.  Chart of the Day  Ether's daily price chart shows the second-largest cryptocurrency has scaled the upper end of the expanding channel identified by colored trendlines and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the November 2021-June 2022 sell-off.  The breakout could bring outsized gains for ether, as chart analyst William Noble told CoinDesk early this year.  ""I saw formations like this in 2009 and 2010 when stocks rallied post-global financial crisis,"" Noble said.

In the last week, its value has gone up a lot more than other cryptocurrencies. Coingecko data shows SHIB’s value has soared to $0.00001136, increasing 8.5% in the last seven days, though it did poorly in the last 24 hours. The meme coin is up 3.2% in the last two weeks. Source: Coingecko However, despite its impressive performance, SHIB’s gains fall short compared to its meme competitors. Dogecoin, for instance, made leaps and bounds, skyrocketing over 30% during the same period. The question on everyone’s minds now is, will SHIB continue its relentless climb, keeping pace with the mighty DOGE? Source: Coingecko Shiba Inu Price Pulled Up As Dogecoin Rallies The catalyst for SHIB’s incredible surge came when Elon Musk, the self-proclaimed “Dogefather”, wielded his Twitter influence and replaced the social media platform’s iconic blue bird logo with SHIB’s legendary Shiba Inu symbol. From that moment on, SHIB’s price saw a steady climb. Despite not holding any SHIB himself, Musk’s influence has been known to affect the price of both DOGE and SHIB. Over the years, these two meme cryptocurrencies have exhibited a history of responding to each other’s movements, with one coin’s price increase often leading to a surge in the other’s value. As such, any action taken by Musk in relation to DOGE has the potential to indirectly affect SHIB’s performance, and vice versa. Where Will Shiba Inu Go From Here? Based on data from TradingView, SHIB has shown positive price movement in the short term, with a gain of 1.60% in just one day and a strong upward trend of 9.09% in the past week. However, in the medium-term perspective, SHIB’s growth has been more modest, with a gain of 2.70% over the last month and 1.97% over the past six months. On the bright side, the year-to-date performance of SHIB has been impressive, with a gain of 41.44%, indicating that the overall trend for SHIB is upward. However, it is important to note that SHIB has experienced significant volatility, as seen in its drastic one-year loss of 56.90%.

Despite its volatility, SHIB has shown a positive price trend over the last five years, with a gain of 14%. It is also worth mentioning that SHIB is a relatively new cryptocurrency, having only been launched in 2020, and so it’s still too early to determine its long-term potential. Overall, the short-term and year-to-date performance of SHIB has been positive, suggesting a strong bullish trend. However, it’s important to keep in mind that SHIB’s volatility and overall market trends could influence its future price movements. -Featured image from Jason Edwards/Getty Images",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB | CHZ,DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | CHZ,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-trails-dogecoin-with-9-rally-will-shib-see-further-gains/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

As a result, the price of Ethereum, as well as other tokens on the blockchain, has been seeing a good upside. However, there are some cryptocurrencies that are uniquely positioned to benefit from this upgrade. Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Make A Run For It As Ethereum has rallied, liquid staking protocols have followed closely behind. These LSD tokens came into prominence with Ethereum’s move to a proof of stake mechanism. Since ETH staked on the network could not be withdrawn, LSD protocols gave stakers their version of wrapped Ether which they could spend while their ETH remained locked. Related Reading: Peter Schiff Warns Investors From Bitcoin, Says They Should Buy This Instead With the planned upgrade on April 12 which would allow stakers to withdraw their ETH, LSD tokens rallied ahead of the news due to their exposure. Lido Finance (LDO) is the leading ETH staking protocol and has been at the forefront of the rally. In the last day, the price of LDO has risen over 10%, making it one of the top gainers. Other LSD tokens have followed suit with Rocket Pool (RPL) rising over 10% in the same time period. Frax Share (FXS), pSTAKE (PSTAKE), and StakeWise (SWISE) are all seeing double-digit gains in the same 24-hour period. LSD tokens all trending in green | Source: CryptoSlate Ankr Protocol (ANKR) is, however, lagging behind the rest with only 3.61% gains. Nevertheless, all of the liquid staking tokens are seeing an upside and will likely continue their run-up right up until the Ethereum upgrade is completed. Ethereum Upgrade Could Trigger More Upside The anticipation around the Shapella upgrade is already reflected in the price of ETH which broke above $1,900 for the first time since August 2022. The cryptocurrency’s rise above this point has been an important catalyst for the recent market rally but the question is whether this rally will continue. ETH price recovers above $1,900 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Interestingly, the Ethereum liquid staking sector has grown to a $4.34 billion market cap. The volume being driven by these protocols serves as even more fuel for the blockchain they’re sitting on, and the more ETH they burn in fees, the higher the chances of more upside for the price. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Could Break Above $0.5 Very Soon, Here’s Why On its own, Ethereum is faring quite well.

42387759,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQsOFr,1680693582,Craig Wright’s UK Contempt of Court Case Over Alleged Embargo Breach Abandoned,"U.K. contempt of court proceedings against Craig Wright, who claims to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, have been dropped after judges said they were ill-equipped to proceed in a case where facts were disputed.  It was no longer in the public interest to continue to act against Wright even if there was, at first sight, evidence that Wright revealed details of a judgment before it was supposed to be published, English High Court Judge Mark Warby said during a Wednesday hearing.  “We have concluded that it is no longer in the public interest to pursue these proceedings,” said Warby, speaking also on behalf of Judge Matthew Nicklin, adding that the court was “ill-equipped to proceed in contempt proceedings where the underlying facts are disputed, or a raft of legal issues raised.”  “We are satisfied that there is prima facie evidence of a breach by Dr. Wright of the embargo on the draft judgment,” Warby said.  Sending judgments in advance is common practice in English courts, allowing counsel for both parties to correct errors and prepare a response. However, revealing contents before official publication can be treated as contempt of court – a deemed prejudice of legal procedures that can carry a sentence of up to two years in jail.  Messages posted on a Slack channel by Wright in August last year could be read as “intending to disclose” the contents of a judgment regarding journalist Peter McCormack that had been sent to Wright’s lawyers just hours previously, Judge Martin Chamberlain said last year in a ruling that referred the matter for further investigation.  According to Chamberlain, Wright said the Slack messages were intended to “encourage debate,” and that he “did not realize” that a separate email he forwarded to five unauthorized people contained a summary of the judgment.  In a later affidavit filed in March, Wright said that key evidence concerning the alleged breach had been submitted by his lawyers at Ontier without his permission, and constituted legally privileged material. Faced with a 17,000-word skeleton argument advanced by Wright’s new attorneys, buttressed by 1,600 pages of legal authorities, Warby concluded the cost of continuing outweighed the benefits.  Wright sued McCormack for libel in 2019 after McCormack said the Australian computer scientist was not the true author of the 2008 pseudonymously written white paper that set out the idea of bitcoin as a cryptocurrency.  While McCormack abandoned his defense on the grounds of cost, Wright was awarded only one British pound in damages when Chamberlain found Wright had “advanced a deliberately false case until shortly before trial.” McCormack was also ordered to pay around 900,000 pounds ($1.1 million) in costs.  In a separate ruling in October, Judge Helen Engebrigtsen of the Oslo District Court in Norway said Markus Granath, tweeting as Hodlonaut, had “ample factual basis to claim that Wright had lied and cheated in his attempt to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.”  Ontier and new counsel for Wright did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42393757,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA1uX,1680692400,"CoinDesk’s Ethereum Validator Enters Final Weeks, Sitting on More Than $30K of Gains","The Valid Points newsletter was founded in December 2020 with the express purpose of chronicling CoinDesk’s project to start and maintain its own validator on the Ethereum blockchain.  The goal, as stated in the first issue, co-authored by former reporters Christine Kim and Will Foxley, was to “deepen CoinDesk’s editorial coverage” and “gain an unvarnished perspective” as the Ethereum network made its landmark shift from the original “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism – the same cryptographic security system used by Bitcoin – to a more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” system.  A month earlier, CoinDesk Director of Engineering C. Spencer Beggs had set up a node on the cloud (currently hosted on Amazon Web Services), and the company bought the required amount of Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), to qualify as a security validator under the proof-of-stake system. Then we “staked” that 32 ETH, essentially depositing it into a Beacon chain smart contract. The Beacon chain was set up to run in parallel with the main Ethereum network in preparation for the eventual transition. At the time, the tokens were worth about $15,000.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  We even gave our validator a nickname, Zelda. Memories are fuzzy, but the choice was inspired either by Zelda Fitzgerald, the flamboyant wife of ""Great Gatsby"" novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, or the character Princess Zelda from the game Legends of Zelda. Or it was just something that popped into Beggs’s head at the moment he was asked to type something into the Beacon Chain explorer.  On April 12, Ethereum will undergo a key upgrade known as the “Shanghai hard fork” (referred to as “Shapella” by some insiders), and validators will now, for the first time, be able to withdraw the tokens in a process known as “unstaking.” It’s the biggest milestone for Ethereum since last September’s “Merge,” when the original proof-of-work blockchain was merged with the Beacon Chain to complete the transition to proof-of-stake. (Watch parties are already being planned for the big night. Geek out with the gang!)  In keeping with our original plan, CoinDesk plans to unstake its 32 ETH shortly after Shanghai goes live – again, so we can test for ourselves if and how the process actually works.  To prepare, we are taking the step of updating our validator software to the most up-to-date version – as recommended in this official blog post from the Ethereum Foundation – as well as migrating our validator to include a 0x01 withdrawal credential and mapping out the technical steps for unstaking.  At the end of the day, Zelda managed to earn 3.598 ETH worth about $6,750 in staking rewards which we pledged from the outset to donate to charity (exactly which charity has yet to be determined). Not bad for a bunch of journalists!  CoinDesk can also return the original outlay of 32 staked ether to its coffers feeling pretty good about its gains. Over the past couple of years, the price of ETH has appreciated substantially, more than tripling in price, for more than $30,000 of principal gains in dollar terms.  History of the project  With the project now entering its final weeks (assuming everything goes smoothly), we decided to provide a brief recap of our experience as a validator.  Once CoinDesk decided to claim a front-row seat to Ethereum’s switch to the proof-of-stake consensus model, spinning up the validator had its own set of logistical challenges.  Christine Kim, one of the former CoinDesk reporters who spearheaded the project, now a vice president of research at Galaxy Digital, said in an interview that “unless you had a higher level of programming knowledge, computer science knowledge, it's actually quite difficult to pull data from your node in a readable format.”  One of the core tenets of public blockchains is that transactions and block validation data is accessible to everybody. But even reporters at CoinDesk, who spend their days analyzing the blockchain, realized that trying to glean data from a node in a cohesive way was harder than expected.  Kim said she originally thought that “once I had the node up and running, it shouldn't take too much effort to build up a data dashboard to analyze that information, but it was actually quite difficult.”  “You actually need to do a lot more heavy engineering work to parse through that data,” she said.  Eventually we figured out where to get the data on our node’s performance. It was available from a publicly accessible, open-source blockchain explorer, beaconcha.in. (The info on our particular node is right here.)  Our responsibility as a validator is to secure the Ethereum network and help it reach consensus by storing data, processing transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. We generated income in two ways: attesting to the current state of the blockchain and proposing data blocks when randomly selected to do so. As happens when one runs a validator node, we earned a daily income from the attesting, but the bigger rewards came when we were chosen to propose a block.  Here are our lifetime stats as a validator: Active since Feb. 17, 2021, the CoinDesk validator has proposed 19 blocks and had more than 174,660 attestation assignments. We executed more than 99% of all attestation assignments, missing roughly 1,250.  We are currently just one of 562,031 total validators, but hey, these stats show our contribution to the daily work of keeping the Ethereum blockchain running securely.  (In May 2021 we estimated it cost about $200 a month to run the validator, essentially the fees we paid to AWS. Beggs, our director of engineering, figured that would be a better alternative, ultimately, than spending $3,000 on a quality computer to host it onsite. An added consideration was that we wouldn’t have to go into the office during the then-lingering COVID-19 pandemic.)  “We needed our own Ethereum 1 node, so we needed all the data for that, and for that you would need a 2- to 4-terabyte, solid-state hard drive, and those can be very expensive,” Beggs said in an interview.  Last year, after the Merge, we took the necessary technical steps to stay current as a validator on the new integrated system.  We weren’t perfect, of course. (Hey, we’re a media company!) For a period of 20 days last year, from Sept. 6 to Sept. 25, the CoinDesk validator stopped attesting, due to a data corruption issue.  The issue was noticed by CoinDesk reporter Sage D. Young, whose job duties included looking up the validator’s performance data each week to put into Valid Points. He noticed that our “attestation inclusion effectiveness” had dropped dramatically to 8%.  “Attestation inclusion effectiveness should be 80% or higher to minimize reward penalties,” according to beaconcha.in.  During the period, CoinDesk racked up penalties of about 0.002372 ETH a day, and obviously we left another 0.0032 ETH on the table for each day, on average, when we weren’t attesting – and maybe missed out on some chances to propose new blocks.  This chart shows CoinDesk's daily validator income in ether (ETH) during a period of time from August through October. The large blue spike on the left shows the fat reward booked when we were chosen to propose a block. The series of orange bars in the middle reflect penalties when we briefly stopped attesting. The mini blue bars represent income from attesting, on a typical day. (beaconcha.in/validator/90969)  Read more: Ethereum's Shanghai Is Nearing, but When Can I Withdraw My Staked ETH?  According to Beggs, the CoinDesk node “had some corrupted data,” and we needed to revalidate roughly eight months of transactions. To make sure our validator was back on track and running without hiccups, Beggs conducted a system reboot, set up a new setting for the Merge and updated our Ethereum execution software client, Geth, and consensus software client, Lighthouse.  Our income from the project resumed Sept. 26, but the penalties over the period amounted to an estimated 0.04744 ETH, with another 0.064 ETH of income we left on the table – a net reduction in lifetime project proceeds of 0.11144 ETH ($208.28 at today’s price), versus what we would have expected had we avoided the issue.  It bears noting that, despite digital-asset markets still being mired in crypto winter, with the price of ether off 62% from its all-time high, CoinDesk has still done quite well on the investment. Over the longer timeframe since we bought the ether, the price has roughly tripled.  What’s impossible to argue is that Ethereum has maintained its position since December 2020 as the dominant “smart-contracts” blockchain – one that’s capable of functioning like an actual computer, in contrast to the Bitcoin’s ambitions as a decentralized financial network.  In that sense, getting a multiple return on our original investment is, at least to some extent, a reflection of the ecosystem’s successful execution (so far) of its transition to a full proof-of-stake network and the community’s enduring loyalty.

The ratio has tanked by nearly 80% in three months, reaching a low of 0.117, the level last seen on May 16, 2022, according to data tracked by South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.  The decline comes amid a 70% year-to-date rise in bitcoin's price and indicates improved risk appetite in the crypto market and potential for price volatility.  The slide has been quite sharp since bitcoin first ran into crucial resistance above $28,500 on March 21. It shows speculators have recently piled into bitcoin at a faster rate relative to retail investors and long-term holders.  ""The theory that the 2023 crypto rally is driven by a diversification out of the [U.S. dollar] and the associated bank credit risk might be standing on weak ground if the rally was indeed purely driven by an increase in leverage,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said, noting the decline in the volume ratio.  ""As the on-ramp from fiat into crypto has become materially more difficult with the likes of Silvergate and Signature Bank being taken over by the regulators. This would suggest that the amount of liquidity has remained the same within crypto but has been allocated to higher leverage products,"" Thielen added. [Silvergate Bank was closed.

Derivatives are contracts of a group of products, including futures and options with values dependent or derived from an underlying asset and involve leverage that magnifies both profits and losses.

At the same time, derivatives are considered a proxy for sophisticated traders and speculators who have ample capital supply and make risky leveraged bets to magnify returns.

42387776,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQsOvx,1680688164,Dogecoin Futures Set Record After Twitter Adopts Token's Dog Logo,"Dogecoin’s derivatives market has become busier than ever after prices rose sharply following Twitter’s decision to replace its blue bird logo with a picture of a Shiba Inu dog earlier this week.  Open interest (OI) in stablecoin-margined dogecoin (DOGE) futures contracts surged to nearly 6 billion DOGE tokens as of Tuesday night, data from Coinanlyze shows, setting a record lifetime peak. This represents $600 million worth of dogecoin in unsettled futures positions as of Wednesday.  The previous peak for stablecoin-margined contracts was five billion DOGE tokens in November 2021, valued at over $1 billion at the time. Stablecoin-margined contracts are settled in tokens such as tether (USDT).  Meanwhile, coin-margined contracts on dogecoin – which settled in other assets, such as bitcoin, instead of stablecoins – saw over $55 million in total open interest as of Wednesday.  Stablecoin or fiat-margined futures offer linear payoff as the value of the collateral remains steady irrespective of the broader market trend. Meanwhile, coin-margined contracts offer a non-linear payoff and are more prone to liquidations, as the trader takes a loss on both the collateral and futures contract when the market goes against his/her bet.  Thus, stablecoin-margined contracts are better suited to risk averse traders and for hedging while coin-margined contracts are preferred by aggressive traders, particularly during bull runs.  What does OI really mean?  OI refers to the number of unsettled contracts, or the net amount of positions opened by traders, on financial derivatives that track an underlying asset. This can be used to determine market strength behind a recent price trend – suggesting market volatility ahead instead of prices remaining flat.  Data shows funding rates, or a fee paid by leverage traders to remain in a futures position, is an average of +0.01% on cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which has the highest open interest among counterparts, and a similar fee on Bybit. Rates on OKX are fluctuating between -0.04% and +0.02%. Positive rates imply leverage is skewed on the bullish side.  Funding rates are periodic payments made by traders based on the difference between prices in the futures and spot markets. Depending on their open positions, traders will either pay or receive funding. The payments ensure there are always participants on both sides of the trade.  Participants utilize sophisticated strategies to collect funding rates while hedging losses due to token movements.  Wary traders  Meanwhile, Coinalyze analysts told CoinDesk that current open interest levels suggested high amounts of leveraged bets on dogecoin.  “Very likely we will see even more liquidators,” the firm said, suggesting the dogecoin market could see steep volatility in the short term.  As such, some say the current move is unlikely to be sustained.  ""Meme coin pumps may generally suggest bullishness amongst retailers. However, this is not indicative of a long-term trend as we can see by the huge DOGE spike of 2021 and the massive slump soon afterward,” François Cluzeau, head of trading at Flowdesk, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “Bitcoin's stable upwards momentum also correlates with this. There is a certain trickle-down effect that follows the no. 1 cryptocurrency.

11437857,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525664,1680681639,"Experts Expect Ethereum (ETH) To Break $2,000 Shortly, Here’s Why","The price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently experiencing a strong upswing, outperforming Bitcoin, which has been able to extend its dominance on the crypto market in recent weeks. Even Bitcoin’s ongoing sideways phase does not seem to worry Ethereum investors, who managed a breakout above $1,900 today. The psychologically important price target of $2,000 is thus within reach. Eight days before the highly anticipated Shapella update on April 12, the Ethereum chart looks extremely bullish. Moreover, the trading month of April is statistically one of the most bullish months of the year for the crypto market. Also, ETH is getting tailwinds from the continued weakness of the US Dollar Index (DXY). Analysts Predict Ethereum To Break Above $2,000 Jonah Van Bourg, head of trading at the crypto asset trading firm Cumberland, published a very bullish analysis on Ethereum via Twitter. As the analyst explains, ETH (unlike Bitcoin) has just broken out of its trading range, which has been in place since mid-March. And the fact that this is happening against the backdrop of a generally bearish regulatory climate makes it even more special. Moreover, various metrics confirm the strong bullish momentum. “Doge-themed redesign of Twitter notwithstanding, ETH gas spiked to 68 gwei yesterday – the highest we’ve seen since the Luna crisis of 2Q22 and its associated flurry of DeFi activity,” Van Bourg declared, pointing to the Shapella update as an actually bearish event. After more than two years, numerous holders will be able to access their staked ETH for the first time, theoretically making large amounts of out-of-the-money ETH units liquid and available for sale. “That said, the exit queue is empty,” Van Bourg noted. Related Reading: Ethereum’s (ETH) Price Rally Set To Persist, On-Chain Data Shows Also bullish is that leverage in the futures market is at a minimum and robust price action suggests that positioning is low and excess longs have already been flushed. According to the Cumberland analyst, Ethereum’s strength could also be an early indicator for an altcoin rally if the recent past repeats itself. Most recently, it has been seen time and time again how the initial BTC strength spilled over to ETH and then to altcoins. Thus, all eyes are on ETH at the moment – a solid retracement would represent an important leading indicator and potentially herald a lucrative trading environment. Cup & Handle Pattern Signals Buying Opportunity Aksel Kibar, a chartered market technician (CMT) has tweeted that ETH/USD could be two days ahead of the BTC/USD trading pair, according to the bullish flag chart pattern breakout that ETH has is forming, while Bitcoin is trailing. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Correlation At A Staggering 97%, BTC Rally Incoming? At the same time, Ethereum has also formed a Cup & Handle pattern over four months on the 1-day chart, as Kibar notes. As the name suggests, the chart pattern resembles a cup with a handle, with the cup shaped like a “U” and the handle drifting slightly downward. The pattern is considered a bullish signal that extends an uptrend and is usually seen as a buying opportunity. At press time, the Ethereum (ETH) price stood at $1,912, up 5% in the last 24 hours.

42414042,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAts0b,1680681623,Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade Could Bring $2.4B Selling Pressure to Ether: Observers,"Ethereum’s backward-incompatible Shapella hard fork or Shanghai upgrade, slated to happen in eight days, will let users withdraw their ""staked ether.""  The lingering fear in the market is that the impending unlocking of ETH deposited in the network to boost security in return for rewards will see some holders rush to exchanges to liquidate their tokens.  According to some observers, the resulting increase in selling pressure could be worth a couple of billion dollars.  ""1.1M ETH related to partial reward withdrawals could face the market, while Celsius [Network] is likely to sell its 158K staked balance as part of its bankruptcy process. These two numbers represent nearly 1.3M ETH or approximately $2.4B worth of potential sell-side pressure to face the market,"" analysts at K33 Research said in a note to clients on Tuesday.  More than 18 million ether has been staked in the network since the Beacon Chain went live in December 2020.  While the entire balance cannot be unstaked immediately after the upgrade, about 1.1 million coins earned as rewards for staking can be instantly withdrawn. Ether stakers are paid rewards in ETH.  Additional selling pressure could come from the bankrupt crypto lender Celsius liquidating its staking balance of 158,176 ETH to recover at least a portion of creditors' funds.  Per K33, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, which recently came under the regulatory hammer for failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto-asset staking-as-a-service program in the U.S., is likely to unstake all ETH staked by stateside investors. At press time, the number of ETH staked through Kraken was 1.2 million.  ""Kraken will unstake all ETH staked by U.S. investors as a result of its Wells Notice [from the Securities and Exchange Commission], this could entice some of Kraken's ETH stakers to sell,"" analysts noted.  Big sell-off unlikely  The expected supply boost of more than $2 billion amounts to just 20% of ether's average daily trading volume, according to data sourced from CoinGecko.  Partial withdrawals are likely to take between five and six days to process, and full withdrawals three weeks and four months, according to an analysis by 21Shares.  In other words, the selling pressure will likely be distributed over several days, allowing buyers to match the selling pressure.  ""Thanks to the modest daily limit on the original 16.27M ether, this potential selling pressure is evenly distributed over a long time. This should allow buyers to match the selling pressure without much impact on the price,"" Saxo Bank's cryptocurrency analyst Max Eberhardt, said in the Shanghai Upgrade preview.  Eberhardt added that a large share of ether stakers are long-term investors and are unlikely to liquidate their holdings after the upgrade.  The chart by K33 shows 46.3% of ether staked is in profit as ether's going market rate is higher than the rate prevalent when these coins were locked in the network. Meanwhile, 28.04% of ether staked is sitting on a profit of more than 20%.  That number drops to 24.2% if we exclude coins staked through liquid staking services offered by Lido and Coinbase. Per K33, 66% of this 24.2%, amounting to 16% of all ETH staked, was deposited before February 2021 by long-term investors.  ""The lion’s share of this group is unlikely to unstake any substantial amount as ETH trades 63% below its [all-time high],"" analysts at K33 said. ""Tokens associated with liquid staking derivatives are unlikely to be unlocked to be sold.""

42414016,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAtqT5,1680680334,Ether Breaking Out Ahead of Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade: Bernstein,"Ether (ETH) has underperformed bitcoin (BTC) this year by 14% but it is now breaking out ahead of the Ethereum blockchain’s planned Shanghai upgrade, Bernstein said in a research report on Wednesday.  With Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade scheduled for April 12, ether has gained 6% in the last 24 hours, and the cryptocurrency is showing early signs of relative strength versus bitcoin, analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  The move higher is reminiscent of when ether rallied into the Merge, the most recent upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain which took place in September, Bernstein said.  The Shanghai upgrade will enable the withdrawal of staked ether (stETH). The Merge involved the transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.  The broker notes investor concerns that post the Shanghai upgrade there would be a supply overhang as stakers can now withdraw their ETH deposit and rewards.  However, as the upgrade approaches there will be an “increased realization” that nearly 70% of staked ether is via liquid staking protocols such as Lido and they allowed investors to sell their stETH regardless, “so liquidity for 70% of staked ETH is now new, they could do it anyway,” the note said.  The remaining staked ether has been directly staked into the beacon chain, and therefore is unlikely to be short-term holders given they deposited their ETH in December 2020 when there was significant uncertainty of whether the transition to proof-of-stake would succeed, the note added.  The ability to deposit and withdraw ether easily gives more confidence for holders to stake, and those on the sidelines are more likely to stake now, the report added.

Ether jumped 5% in the past 24 hours, a top performer among major tokens, to over $1,920 on Wednesday morning. That’s the highest price level for the token since August 2022, CoinDesk data shows.  Open interest, or the number of unsettled derivative contracts, for ether futures rose to $5.6 billion in the past 24 hours with over $23 billion worth of these products traded on crypto exchanges.  The interest in ether trading comes ahead of Shapella, a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two major Ethereum network upgrades that are expected to occur simultaneously on April 12. Shapella will allow investors to withdraw their ether staked on the Ethereum blockchain. Staked ether cannot be withdrawn or freely traded currently.  Some say the event could prove bullish for ether in the future because staking and capturing yields directly from the blockchain becomes more accessible to users.  “Allowing withdrawals, boosted by the recent popularity of liquid staking platforms, will make ETH staking much more accessible to retail investors who were previously unwilling to stake ETH for an undetermined amount of time,” said Chen Zhuling, CEO at staking service RockX, in a note to CoinDesk.  So far, investors have relied on liquid staking platforms such as Lido and Rocketpool, which issue the LDO and RPL tokens, respectively, to capture yields from staking ether on Ethereum nodes while freeing up capital for other uses. Uses range from using these tokens as collateral for loans or margin trading to earning additional yield.  This has culminated in the liquid staking derivatives (LSD), a term for tokens issued by such platforms, emerging as one of the strongest investor plays in 2023.  Liquid staking tokens jumped overnight as investors bet on growth in decentralized staking products ahead of Shapella, data shows.  The liquid staking sector jumped 6% on average, CoinGecko data shows, while the broader crypto market capitalization rose a relatively lesser 3%.  LDO and RPL led gains in this sector with a 5% rise each, while tokens with a smaller market capitalization, such as Stader’s SD, surged 22%.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/05/ether-jumps-to-nine-month-high-ahead-of-shapella-liquid-staking-tokens-jump,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77b9be46f121aff1bed4aa4fc81646dc4bcad465-1918x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

PostFinance, which is owned by the Swiss government, will start by providing its 2.5 million customers access to buy, store and sell leading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), with more crypto-tokens to be added in due course.  Switzerland marches to the beat of its own drum and stands in stark contrast to places like the U.S., where a concerted effort to stamp crypto out seems to be the end goal. Crypto-focused Sygnum, which attained a banking license from Swiss regulators some four years ago, caters to a range of institutions, including Cantonal banks and private banks.  “Digital assets have become an integral part of the financial world, and our customers want access to this market at PostFinance, their trusted principal bank,” said PostFinance Chief Investment Officer Philipp Merkt in a statement. “A reputable and established partner like Sygnum Bank with an excellent service offering is more important than ever.”  The decision by PostFinance to branch into crypto was partly driven by outflows from retail banks in Switzerland into the digital asset class, according to Fritz Jost, chief B2B officer, Sygnum Bank.  “PostFinance became aware of a considerable number in the hundreds of millions each year of outflows to crypto exchanges and the like,” said Jost in an interview with CoinDesk. “So they saw that this is not only as an opportunity to add a new revenue stream, but also realized that this has a lot to do with client retention.”  Jost said a diverse range of cryptos will be certainly made available but has not been decided yet by PostFinance.  “We have seen banks make crypto available to their clients before, and the next thing they want is staking and so on,” said Jost. “I can certainly confirm PostFinance has a roadmap, and it’s a case of start with buy, hold and sell to sort of grease the wheels within the organization and clients.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/05/swiss-government-owned-bank-postfinance-to-offer-customers-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ef3afd448edde39821d9fb15979c93228552e33-6641x3736.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414028,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAtqtc,1680667924,"As Bitcoin Platform Paxful Closes, Co-Founder Youssef Talks Up Alternatives","Paxful, the peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace popular in countries including Nigeria and Kenya, has suspended operations. But Paxful co-founder Ray Youssef is already trying to rally support for a new platform called Civilization Kit (Civ Kit) – a decentralized peer-to-peer bitcoin trading application, built on the Jack Dorsey-backed decentralized social media protocol, Nostr.  A white paper for Civ Kit will be released in one or two weeks, according to Youssef. He plans to rally the Bitcoin community to help build and fund the project.  For now, Paxful is encouraging users to move funds to non-custodial wallets or other platforms such as the newly created Noones peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace co-founded by Yusuf Nessary and Nicholas Gregory. Youssef says he supports Noones but doesn’t have a direct role in the company.  Nessary is also the co-founder and director of Built With Bitcoin (BWB), a Paxful-funded nonprofit organization seeking to provide “humanitarian support, powered by Bitcoin.”  Youssef says Paxful, a Delaware corporation, succumbed to regulatory pressure and internal squabbling, precipitating Tuesday's shutdown, and that Civ Kit will be “the next evolution of Bitcoin.”  “We spent millions on compliance, but even that still wasn’t enough,” Youssef told CoinDesk in an interview. “And then to make things worse, in the middle of January, my co-founder decided to sue the company and myself. The litigation got really nasty and he scared away our best people. My entire chief level staff resigned. I had no operational staff.”  Paxful’s co-founder, Artur Schaback, accused Youssef of shutting him out of the operation, withholding key details about Paxful’s business dealings and making fraudulent fund transfers, according to a recent lawsuit filed last week.  “It was like some kind of horrible divorce,” Youssef said. “He was fired over a year ago for several things, namely incompetence and bad behavior. He refused to partake in the internal investigation. He was legally fired.”  CoinDesk was unable to reach Schaback for comment.  Read more: Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin Exchange Paxful to Suspend Operations  Paxful was founded in 2015 and facilitated peer-to-peer crypto trading. The marketplace removed support for ether last year citing Ethereum’s move to proof-of-stake.  Youssef describes Paxful as crypto’s “Craigslist.” Users exchanged bitcoin for cash, gift cards, mobile money and other forms of currency on a peer-to-peer basis. Paxful provided escrow and dispute resolution services for a fee.  “It's just three things: It's a wallet and it's a listing service like Craigslist,” Youssef explained. A user can say “Hey, I have a $100 Amazon gift card. Give me $80 in bitcoin and we're good. And then it's an escrow. It's an escrow meaning that once I trade with someone, the escrow guarantees the bitcoins are actually there.”  Noones mirrors Paxful’s functionality, based on a release provided to CoinDesk. It too has three components: a messenger, a marketplace and a wallet. Escrow and moderation services are available to users and Lightning Network functionality will become available in several weeks..  “The company is based out of the European Union and the United Arab Emirates and will be initially focused on building peer-to-peer financial solutions for the Global South,” the release states.  Besides being built on Nostr, Civ Kit will differ from Noones and Paxful because it will enable anyone to build a decentralized bitcoin-based marketplace on top of Civ Kit. The goal is to form a network of decentralized non-custodial bitcoin marketplaces.  “It is possibly the most exciting thing since Bitcoin,” Youssef said. “This will allow anyone – community or nation state – to build their own decentralized marketplace.

BTC must clear $29,000 to start a fresh rally and clear the $30,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin is showing positive signs above the $28,000 support zone. The price is trading above $28,200 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $28,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another rally if it clears the $28,800 and $29,000 resistance levels. Bitcoin Price Consolidates Gains Bitcoin price remained well supported above the $27,550 zone. BTC formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $28,000 resistance zone. There was a clear move above the $28,200 and $28,500 resistance levels. However, the price struggled to clear the $28,800 resistance zone. A high is formed near $28,792 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading above $28,200 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Bitcoin price is also above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $27,212 swing low to the $28,792 high. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $28,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance is near the $28,800 level. The next major resistance is near the $29,000 zone. A clear move above the $29,000 level might pump the price towards the $29,800 resistance. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance is near the $30,000 level, above which the price could rise towards the $31,200 level. Any more gains might call for a test of the $32,000 resistance zone. Another Decline in BTC? If bitcoin price fails to clear the $28,800 resistance, it could start another decline. An immediate support on the downside is near the $28,400 zone and the trend line. The next major support is near the $28,000 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $27,212 swing low to the $28,792 high.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Dogecoin dropped into the red late Tuesday, while bitcoin and ether rose solidly as crypto markets absorbed the latest jobs report.  Insights: Jason Pagoulatos tied Binance's loss of market share largely to growing entanglements with regulators. He also opined about bitcoin's path forward.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,241 +37.1 ▲ 3.1% Bitcoin (BTC) $28,594 +751.3 ▲ 2.7% Ethereum (ETH) $1,910 +98.6 ▲ 5.4% S&P 500  4,100.60 −23.9 ▼ 0.6% Gold  $2,022 −0.2 ▼ 0.0% Nikkei 225  28,287.42 +99.3 ▲ 0.4% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  A Bitcoin Rally Past $28.5K  DOGE was down and so were jobs. But bitcoin wasn't.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at $28,622, up 2.6% as investors contemplated a welcome dip in the heated job market but also remained cautious about the future after weeks of banking uncertainty.  Trading and volatility were light. On Monday, BTC had tumbled below the $28,000 threshold it has largely surpassed over the past two weeks after a rumor spread that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao faced an international law enforcement request to detain him. (Binance denied the rumor in an email to The Block.)  ""Bitcoin is hovering around the high end of its recent range as crypto traders await to see how it will benefit from the current banking crisis,"" said Edward Moya of Oanda, although he also noted that ""the bitcoin bear case"" was growing.  Ether (ETH) spent the day outperforming BTC and was changing hands above $1,900 for the first time since August. The second-largest crypto by market value was up 5.5% from Monday, at the same time.  Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit lighter shades. MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, and SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, recently jumped 5.2% and 3.8%, respectively. Popular meme coin DOGE dropped 0.7%. The decline came a day after it climbed dramatically as Elon Musk's Twitter replaced the social-media platform's familiar blue bird logo atop its homepage with the cryptocurrency's iconic Shiba Inu dog. DOGE is up 21% from the start of the week.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets' overall performance, was recently up more than 3%.  U.S. equity markets fell slightly with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 both closing down about a half-percentage point. But gold – the traditional, safe-haven asset – soared above $2,000, reaching its highest level since last March after a U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report showed job vacancies falling below 10 million for the first time in almost two years, and a day after another report showed durable goods orders waning. The signs of economic decline coupled with ongoing inflation concerns have created a favorable backdrop for more conservative assets that historically hold their value through good times and bad.  ""A weakening economy continues to drive safe-haven flows towards gold,"" Oanda's Moya wrote. ""The JOLTS report supported the view that the economy is steadily weakening its way towards a recession.""  He added that investors should monitor bitcoin's price near the end of a Good Friday-shortened working week, and the U.S. Labor Department releases nonfarm payrolls (NFP) figures. ""Bitcoin has had a key price barrier at the $30,000 level and if Friday’s NFP report shocks to the downside, we could see high-frequency trading systems and algos try to take advantage of any momentum opportunities,"" Moya wrote.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Ethereum ETH +5.5% Smart Contract Platform Avalanche AVAX +5.3% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC +5.3% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Dogecoin DOGE −0.7% Currency  Insights  Jason Pagoulatos Talks Binance and Bitcoin  Even the giant among crypto exchanges, Binance, can't outrun bad news, the head of markets for crypto research firm Delphi Digital told CoinDesk TV in an interview Tuesday.  Jason Pagoulatos tied Binance's dramatic loss of market share over the past two weeks to its recent regulatory entanglements in the U.S. and beyond.  ""I would definitely say a pretty big contributor to the decline in market share you've had these rumors of Binance being in trouble with global regulators,"" Pagoulatos said.  Binance remains the top exchange for trading volume, but its market share has tumbled from about 70% to 54% since the final weeks of March. To be sure, the plunge has come as the exchange halted its no-fee trading promotion for 13 bitcoin spot trading pairs. Binance witnessed its lowest bitcoin (BTC) trading volume since July 2022 on March 27.  But the exchange has also lost ground after the U.S. Commodity Futures Futures Trading Commission sued the exchange and founder Changpeng Zhao, alleging they offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law.  On Monday, Binance suffered another blow when a rumor surfaced that Zhao faced an international law enforcement request to detain him, referred to as an Interpol Red Notice. On Twitter, Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann wrote, ""One of two things is true: 1. It's bulls**t; 2. A law enforcement agent is illegally leaking elements of a case file."" He added: ""My bet is #1.""  Pagoulatos saw BTC's dip Monday following the rumor as a flight to safety. ""When people are trading bitcoins, they're gonna be trading on places like Binance, Coinbase, Bybit,"" he said. ""And when there are rumors of, say, the CEO of the biggest exchange being a wanted fugitive, people are obviously going to want to withdraw their money, sell their bitcoin, get it off as fast as possible.""  Bitcoin has more recently rebounded above the $28,000 level where's its stood for large portions of the last two weeks. Pagoulatos hedged as to its future path. ""We had this significant rally off $20K all the way up to $28K,"" he said. ""And, like, $28K to $30K is a big area of significance. It's kind of where bitcoin was trading before Three Arrows Capital's collapse last year – that huge hedge fund liquidation event – so this area's going to be a tough spot for bitcoin to get through.""  He added: ""What's going to be interesting is what path bitcoin follows from here. Is it going to trade more in line with risk assets? Or does it trade more in line with what gold does?""

The lack of pullbacks could be due to a “super” technical tool indicating that almost all important resistance has been flipped to support. Let’s take a closer look at the SuperGuppy technical indicator and what is says about the trend in crypto. BTCUSD Breaks Above The 1M SuperGuppy: What This Means When Bitcoin or any asset begins an impulsive uptrend, there tends to be very few to no pullbacks offering an opportunity to buy the dip. The late 2020 rally through April 2021 was often described as “only up” as an example. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Could Be Less Than 120 Days Away From Retesting ATHs This behavior happens when massive demand kicks in during a phase of lower supply, when selling is exhausted, and when resistance has been turned to support. With support below the asset, prices don’t fall quite as hard and are bought up significantly faster. That’s exactly what’s started to happen according to the 1M SuperGuppy technical indicator. In fact, the tool suggests resistance has been flipped to support on almost every timeframe from the daily to the monthly. BTC is above the SuperGuppy moving averages | BTCUSD on TradingView.com It’s Not A Bird, It’s Not A Plane, It’s A Bitcoin Rally Not to be confused with NASA’s 100,000 pound plane, the SuperGuppy is a technical indicator that derives it’s name from its creator, Daryl Guppy. Guppy is a financial columnist and author who developed the tool to spot potential trend changes. The SuperGuppy is often referred to as the GMMA or Guppy Multiple Moving Average. The tool utilizes a group of shorter and longer term moving averages. These moving averages can act as dynamics support and resistance, or indicate when a trend has changed depending on the slope of the averages. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Points To New Uptrend, Here’s Why In the past Bitcoin price breaking through the monthly timeframe SuperGuppy moving averages has led to as sustained rally, with the averages acting as support the entire way up. It also put in a significant long term crypto market bottom. With BTCUSD now trading well above the SuperGuppy moving averages, will the top cryptocurrency once again see a sustained rally? #Bitcoin monthly has cleared all the MAs in the Super Guppy. Resistance is now support.
