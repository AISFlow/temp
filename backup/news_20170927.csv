42400473,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJgdD,1506549636,Morgan Stanley CEO: Bitcoin Is 'More Than Just A Fad',"The head of one of Wall Street's biggest banks believes bitcoin is ""more than just a fad.""  James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley, made the comments during an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal today. According to Bloomberg, Gorman said that the privacy features of cryptocurrency are compelling.  He said:  ""The concept of anonymous currency is a very interesting concept – interesting for the privacy protections it gives people, interesting because what it says to the central banking system about controlling that.""  That said, Gorman isn't personally invested, though he did say he has encountered a number of people who have bought a stake in the market.  ""I've talked to a lot of people who have,"" he said at the event. ""It's obviously highly speculative but it's not something that's inherently bad. It's a natural consequence of the whole blockchain technology.""  Gorman's moderated stance stands in contrast to comments issued this month by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who made headlines when he said he believes bitcoin is a ""fraud."" He later doubled down on those remarks, predicting that governments would move more forcefully to crack down on cryptocurrencies.  According to Bloomberg, Gorman himself pointed to that question of future regulatory developments around cryptocurrencies, wondering aloud when regulators would ""decide [they] want to control monetary flows for money laundering and privacy and capital outflows and all the other reasons.""

42400463,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJgUM,1506543032,Staking Sidechains? New Paper Proposes Twist on Bitcoin Tech,"A pseudonymous developer is seeking to refresh an old idea for boosting bitcoin's functionality.  Named 'proof-of-mainstake,' the paper proposes an incentive system for the mining of sidechains, blockchains with alternative rulesets that developers believe could one day be ""attached"" to bitcoin. At its core, the idea proposes securing sidechains, designed to boost the functionality of bitcoin, by entering miners into a kind of lottery system.  In this way, the proof-of-mainstake proposal aims to solve the issue of miner incentives by allowing traders to bet on a sidechain with real bitcoin, an incentive scheme similar to what's being used in ethereum's still-in-development proof-of-stake protocol, Casper.  With proof-of-mainstake, miners would put coins aside on the bitcoin blockchain for the specific purpose of using outputs from those coins as a kind of lottery ticket. The winner of that lottery would then create a block and bribe miners to accept that block in the main bitcoin blockchain.  The innovation claimed is that the proposal encourages miners to better maintain the sidechains, without discouraging or hindering their ability to compete for bitcoin's lucrative rewards.  The proposal follows years of discussion on a concept that, over time, has been proposed as a solution to nearly every perceived bitcoin problem, including privacy, scalability and governance. But while promising, the idea has struggled to come to life, mostly over the issue of how to incentivize miners to secure transactions on the alternative chains.  Whether this new idea will be able to win favor from developers remains to be seen, however, given that it takes aim at drivechain, a well-regarded idea with an emerging developer community, the paper will likely add to the discussion.

Speaking with TheStreet, Celente, who is the publisher of Trends Journal, argued that banks are fearful that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will ""take away their business,"" going so far as to argue they're ""trying to kill it.""  But while this could be taken as an off-the-cuff comment, Celente appears very much convinced. ""There's no two ways about it,"" he said.  In the interview, Celente invoked recent comments from Wall Street figures like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who have largely criticized the cryptocurrency space and, in the case of Dimon, declared bitcoin a fraud. Celente predicted that such attacks can be expected to continue as long as bitcoin is around.  He said in the interview:  ""[The] banks are going to continue to talk it down because it makes banking obsolete and the banksters obsolete. So they're going to do everything they can to stop it.""  And while Celente says he doesn't own any cryptocurrencies – noting that ""I'd rather invest in a tangible, so I invest in gold"" – he believes the market isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  ""We don't believe it's going to go away. We don't know the [long-term], but the price shot up too quickly as we see it.""  Looking beyond the speculative dynamics of the market, Celente said that cryptocurrencies are attracting attention because they offer an alternative to existing structures both financial and political.  ""What bitcoin also represents is the populist movements around the world. People don't wanna be attached to crooked governments and central banks,"" he said.

42379916,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LF7N,1506521414,DASHed Hopes? Dash Price Looking Heavy as Bullish Setup Stumbles,"Despite noticeable gains in the wider cryptocurrency market, the price of dash is mildly bid today. At press time, the dash-US dollar exchange rate (DASH/USD) continues to struggle, further establishing a trend that began September 19.  What makes the lackluster price action even more unusual, though, is the fact that just a week ago, the cryptocurrency, known for its governance and privacy features, looked primed for a retest of record highs above $400 courtesy of a bullish falling channel breakout.  At press time, however, dash is trading at $348; up just 0.5% in the last 24 hours.  Week-on-week, the Dash-US dollar exchange rate is down 6%, while on a monthly basis, the exchange rate is down 12.5%.  The exact reason for the weakness is unknown, although it must be noted that dash is known to act differently than other markets. Further, the lack of fundamental news leaves us with just price action analysis, which indicates heightened odds of a bearish move.  Possible downside break  Daily chart  The chart above shows a ""bull flag breakout"" – a bullish continuation pattern generally found in uptrends. Resembling a flag on a pole, the pole is the result of a vertical rise in the cryptocurrency, while the flag is due to consolidation.  An upside break of the bull flag pattern as seen on the chart above indicates the continuation of the rally from $161 (August 13 low). However, the weak followthrough (as indicated by the repeated failure to cut through $360 levels) is a cause of concern.  Adding to the latter view is the multiple daily candles with a long upper shadow (upper body). It indicates the upticks to $360 levels have been met with fresh offers (sellers).  View  Dash looks set to test the psychological support level of $300. The upward sloping 50-day moving average is located at $303.  Traders need to be flexible as the potential for a rally still exists. The bullish move would gather pace following an end of the day close above $360.

42379917,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LF67,1506517205,It's Political: Why China Hates Bitcoin and Loves the Blockchain,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  In this opinion piece, one of a weekly series of columns, Casey considers China's recent moves against bitcoin exchanges and ICOs in a wider geopolitical context.  The crypto community is once again reeling from a Chinese crackdown and trying to read the tea leaves on Beijing's next move.  China's policymaking is far from transparent, so one can only speculate how long the new restrictions on bitcoin exchanges and token sales might last.  Still, if we view China's actions in the context of its broader geopolitical intentions, we can at least gain a useful picture of what's at stake and the longer-term challenges and opportunities they create for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.  Consider the following:  The People's Bank of China appears to be closer to issuing a digital fiat currency than pretty much any other central bank on the planet. It has launched its own digital currency research institute with a director who openly talks about its design possibilities with publications such as CoinDesk.  China's desire to end the U.S. dollar's global dominance has grown more strident, as with other members of the BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) international group. Russian President Putin, speaking after the BRICS gathering in the Chinese city of Xiamen this month, said the group would work together ""to overcome the excessive domination of the limited number of reserve currencies.""  Quite apart from its wariness toward bitcoin, China is committed to distributed ledger technology. A variety of high-level consortia have been formed by government and business institutions to develop and implement DLT. China's own IT Ministry is backing a new blockchain lab, announced just days after the crackdown on bitcoin trading.  With its ""Belt and Road Initiative,"" estimated to entail investments of $900 billion across land and sea routes encompassing 65 different countries, China is spearheading the world's most comprehensive international trade and infrastructure development plan, a Marshall Plan-like model for projecting economic and political influence overseas.  Cutting the (U.S.) middleman  In short, it's clear the Chinese government wants to foster international trade under its own terms and end the financial, economic and political hegemony of the U.S.  With President Donald Trump embracing ""America First"" protectionism and a disdain for diplomacy that angers U.S. allies, Beijing sees an opportunity to seize the mantle of global leadership. (Whether it can or not is a question we'll address later.)  Given its investments in this space, it seems clear that Chinese authorities see blockchain technology as a potentially useful, disintermediating tool for advancing its regional interests, especially in trade. Much work is being done, for example, to incorporate smart contacts, tokens and other aspects of blockchain technology into supply-chain management systems that enhance information-sharing and efficiency.  This month's launch of the Hong Kong-based Belt and Road Blockchain Consortium offers an international framework for tying the technology to China's larger ambitions.  High-tech Chinese-backed upgrades to supply-chain logistics will only make those blockchain solutions more viable. One such upgrade, announced at the Xiamen summit, is the BRICS ""E-Port network,"" which the group described as ""an integrated electronic platform to process and monitor cross-border movement of merchandise and transportation vessels at a port level.""  More aggressively, China could use this technology to directly go after U.S. interests and the dominance of the dollar. We know that China and Russia are already collaborating on blockchain-based securities settlement.  It's not a stretch to imagine these two powers exploring blockchain solutions – perhaps a combination of smart contracts and multi-signature escrow accounts – that would let their respective importers and exporters settle trade debts with direct cross-currency swaps.  This could end the dollar's role as the intermediating currency when exporters or importers wish to protect themselves from adverse moves in their local currencies. It would cut out Wall Street's middleman correspondent banks, slash transaction costs and undermine a triangulating system that has given the U.S. great influence on trade.  It's far from the only reason China and Russia are exploring a digital currency, but it's fair to say that fiat digital currencies would make bilateral swap solutions far more viable.  For the U.S., the fallout could be intense.  If Chinese and Russian businesses no longer needed to make trade payments in dollars, their governments might not have to hold greenbacks as a reserve currency, either. Meanwhile, if this disintermediated trade solution worked, most other countries would surely follow it.  Americans cannot afford to be complacent about the dominance of the dollar and the advantages – lower interest rates, for starters – that has afforded them over the past 70 years.  China's challenge  So, does this mean China will ascend to dominant superpower status? Not necessarily.  The main reason to bet against such an outcome is that China's current, closed economic system limits its capacity to innovate. Chinese companies are excellent at copying others' ideas, but in general, they aren't great inventors (with the exception of cutting-edge advances in solar technology and payments).  Closed, planned economies don't encourage open innovation; you can't order creativity into existence through government diktat.  This is where China's moves against ICOs and bitcoin could backfire. Both phenomena are part of an emerging global system of permissionless innovation – an anything-goes, chaotic soup of ideas. In that system, developers can monetize new decentralized applications and profit from collaboration rather than rely on restrictive, litigated intellectual property protection.  It's understandable that China's central planners are unnerved by this seemingly anarchic world of crowdfunded ideas, one over which they have no control. It's also why most China-based blockchain research is likely focused on permissioned ledgers over which the government can exert control.  Yet, by curtailing the power of unfettered, open-source innovation, China is cutting itself off from the new ideas and dynamic solutions that it needs to stay ahead of the West.  The Communist Party's survival depends, paradoxically, on relentless, continued economic growth on the one hand and control of information, money flows and ideas on the other. But you can't achieve the former if you're practicing the latter. Ultimately, China will be powerless to compete against bitcoin and its successors, since they directly enable a decentralized, censorship-resistant system of exchange that levels the playing field and fosters a global, self-perpetuating pool of unbeatable innovation.  Given the current policy priorities of the Trump administration, the U.S. won't likely be the winner in this. But neither will China if it continues on its present course.  The age of cryptocurrency will deliver the spoils to countries, businesses and individuals that operate within a system of open access, property rights and free trade – the principles upon which U.S. hegemony was originally built.

At press time, the cryptocurrency that powers the world's largest blockchain is trading at $4,070, up 3% on the day. On a monthly basis, though, it is still nursing 6% loss.  With the positive price action, investors appear to also be turning a blind eye toward news out of China that indicates at least one major domestic bitcoin exchange has followed through on apparent orders from regulators to stop yuan trading.  ""All customers will be able to withdraw all their funds from our exchanges within 72 hours,"" BTCC said in a statement.  Elsewhere, speculation is gathering pace that a small group of miners and developers carry out a planned fork of the blockchain this month. The fork may lead to the creation of a new network called bitcoin gold, that would give new cryptocurrency to all bitcoin holders.  Still, investors are at ease despite the talk of another hard fork. So is bitcoin heading for the moon? The price action analysis does suggest bright times ahead for the cryptocurrency, although it still needs to clear the last technical hurdle.

42379906,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LEtX,1506510002,Regulated ICOs Arrive: Overstock to Open Exchange for Legal Token Trading,"Get ready for regulated token trading.  Announced today, tØ, the capital markets arm of Overstock's blockchain-focused subsidiary Medici, is launching a first-of-its-kind alternative trading system (ATS) that will provide a platform for the exchange of cryptographic tokens categorized in the U.S. as securities.  A joint venture with RenGen (a fintech firm that will serve as the market maker) and Argon Group (an investment bank specializing in ICO capital raising), the ATS will be regulated by both the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  In short, the ATS will offer a legally approved, regulated alternative to a major securities exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.  As such, the platform may be seen as a major step forward for the token space. Simply put, there are currently no other regulator-approved ways for U.S. investors to trade security tokens.  Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock.com, told CoinDesk:  ""I think it's a historic event. We're opening a new type of capital market.""  Market need  Stepping back, the launch of the ATS follows statements by Overstock in June indicating that the company was looking for new ways to utilize technology originally developed as part of a planned blockchain stock market offering aimed at traditional capital markets.  But, as profiled by CoinDesk, in the wake of an SEC decision to class some tokens as securities, Overstock's Medici arm found itself with a fully formed product ready to capitalize on another market entirely – one that had been gaining momentum globally.  It might be an understatement, but the market for cryptocurrency investments is booming, having eclipsed the $2 billion mark this year, according to the CoinDesk ICO Tracker.  And that may be a drop in the bucket compared to what's ahead.  Emma Channing, Argon's general counsel and interim CEO, told CoinDesk she believes her firm's new ATS could see $2 billion in trading within the next 12 months.  Put another way, Argon projects that the total ICO issuance volume could soon top $4 billion.  In addition to creating liquidity for a new type of security, Byrne said the new platform will have appeal in that it will reduce transaction costs by 80–90 percent over the model now in use by traditional securities exchanges.  The benefits of blockchain would also allow trades to clear at the time of execution, compared to the current three-day time lag that investors currently experience at traditional stock exchanges, he said.  According to Byrne, decreased costs and faster settlement times will mean a fairer market, with greater liquidity and more efficient price discovery.  Another avenue  But the impact could be felt by another key group: developers and entrepreneurs launching token sales.  In the current environment, ICO issuers are now faced with a dilemma – either they must attempt to create a token that does not meet the SEC's definition of a security, or they must meet that definition and give up the liquidity that comes from being publicly traded.  According to Channing, though, the new platform announced today will eliminate that choice.  ""We believe this is exactly what the SEC was asking for in the DAO report,"" she told CoinDesk.  Channing went on to describe how, in Argon Group's view, the new platform will allow ICO issuers to design tokens that are investment products.  ""You can promise a return, you can promise portfolio tokens, you can promise all sorts of interesting ways of providing a financial return,"" she said.  Speaking to the same point, Overstock's Byrne struck a similar note:  ""At the moment, there is precisely one [SEC approved exchange focusing on tokens] in the world – and we own it.""

The code was spotted over the weekend and was removed by the firm Monday.  Thus far, Showtime hasn't commented publicly on the news, and a representative for the network declined to comment when contacted by CoinDesk.  The developments are notable given the public profile of Showtime, which is owned by U.S. media giant CBS Corporation.

The company, Sharps Pixley, announced on September 26 that it would begin accepting the cryptocurrency through a partnership with payments processor startup BitPay.  In statements, representatives from the firm framed the move as a way to offer wealthier clientele a way to invest in gold using their cryptocurrency holdings instead of fiat money.

42379901,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LEpl,1506499207,"First Cash, Now Gold? Another Bitcoin Hard Fork Is on the Way","Bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold?  There could be multiple cryptocurrencies bearing the bitcoin name if a small group of miners and developers carry out a planned fork of the blockchain this month.  Styled as a rebellion of sorts, bitcoin gold aims to follow a similar launch plan as bitcoin cash – the blockchain that split from bitcoin this summer by way of a ""hard fork."" The idea of the project is to release an improved protocol, one that will challenge bitcoin cash in particular, and details are now starting to come into focus.  Led by Jack Liao, CEO of Hong Kong mining firm LightningASIC, bitcoin gold is slated to launch on October 25, with its cryptocurrency being opened to exchanges on November 1.  Still, while whispers of the event are just beginning to spread, the importance of the project appears up for debate. Given that bitcoin cash produced an ultimately smaller bitcoin network, not to mention a cryptocurrency that's worth about 12 percent as much as bitcoin at press time, most seem to view the plan as another distraction in an already divided community.  For one, bitcoin gold looks like it could be even smaller than bitcoin cash, at least in that not as many miners seem to support it.  In remarks, BTC.Top founder Jiang Zhuoer and ViaBTC CEO Haipo Yang – two early champions of bitcoin cash – went so far as to downplay bitcoin gold as insignificant.  'Decentralized again'  But while those in the know might be skeptical of bitcoin gold, it does have a goal that many in the community may find attractive: creating a truly decentralized bitcoin.  Most notably, the developers behind the network hope to open up mining to more participants by replacing bitcoin's mining algorithm with one that will enable it to be mined with graphics cards. The idea is to make big miners – sometimes controversial figures on the network – less relevant.  ""Bitcoin gold will implement a proof-of-work change from bitcoin's SHA256 to Equihash, a memory-hard algorithm that is ASIC-resistant and optimized for GPU mining,"" explained pseudonymous bitcoin gold developer ""The Sorrow.""  That the plan is being hatched in China, long the hotbed of bitcoin mining, only adds another layer to the story. Liao, whose mining hardware largely focuses on the litecoin network, is seen as one of the few voices domestically that can challenge the established order.  Yet, Liao was quick to name one mining firm in particular, Bitmain, as the reason that more bitcoin users should support the idea. A mining company that has been at the center of bitcoin drama over the last year, critics have long argued that the firm has too much of an influence over the network.  Still, creating a network that grows so popular as to remove miners is easier said than done, and some are skeptical that this would lead to the end goal that bitcoin gold advocates desire.  ""GPU mining can't prevent centralization. GPU [markets] are controlled by Nvidia and AMD,"" Zhao Dong, a cryptocurrency trader and investor, argued in response to the plan.  Liao, however, argued the accessibility of the companies' products means the distribution of hashing power might evolve differently.  Bitcoin gold's unknowns  Again, though, even project leaders admit many of the details around the hard fork are fuzzy.  Bitcoin gold's pseudonymous lead developer ""h4x"" said that the project is ""still evolving"" and details such as exact block height of the hard fork are still up for discussion.  According to the original website text, bitcoin gold was even planning an initial coin offering (ICO) by which 1 percent of the bitcoin gold coins would go to the developer team, but these details have since been removed.  One thing is clear though about the funding: because of the nature of the split, every bitcoin user at the time will have an equal amount of bitcoin gold associated with their private key.  ""It is a minimalist fork of the Bitcoin Core codebase in the spirit of litecoin – only a few conservative modifications,"" said h4x.  H4x went on to describe bitcoin gold in more abstract biological terms, arguing that it tests how well hard forks work and if they benefit the ecosystem.  He said:  ""Organisms derive benefits from creating offspring. With bitcoin gold we are conducting an experiment to see if that principle holds true in the world of blockchains.""  And this sentiment is largely in line with developers who have predicted that more bitcoin forks similar to bitcoin cash will come forth in the future.  After bitcoin cash forked earlier this summer, for example, Lightning Network developer Tadge Dryja argued that more forks would spring up, but for another reason: money.  With bitcoin gold in the works and another hard fork slated for November, it seems that prediction is slowly becoming reality.
