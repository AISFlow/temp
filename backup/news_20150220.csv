The partnership will enable BetaRigs customers to effectively rent out hash rates to Mintsy customers when the feature goes live early next month. The Mintsy mining platform, announced in September, is a joint venture between digitalBTC and digital currency exchange Cryptsy.  The partnership will enable clients of the BetaRigs service to plug into a larger hub of potential customers as Mintsy moves toward the completion of its beta testing period, according to Final Hash chief technology officer Marshall Long.  Long said the partnership will feature a method by which hash rates leased out by BetaRigs users can be divided into smaller tranches of mining power and sold to Mintsy customers.  He told CoinDesk:  “[Customers] will be able to trade and split up their hash rates. So let’s say you’ve got an S4 and you want to split that into three contracts or four contracts of 500 GH/s apiece - you can do that with Mintsy technology that’s merging with BetaRigs.”  BetaRigs was purchased last monthhttp://bitcoinist.net/finalhash-purchases-betarigs-will-roll-new-features-near-future/ by cryptocurrency consultancy Final Hash from its original owners.  More upgrades in development  In conversation, both Long and developer Ahmed Bodiwala cited the data center-scale of some BetaRigs customers as a key factor in the partnership, which provides a method to offer larger contracts for longer rental durations.  Long said that other features, including an increased range of both fiat and cryptocurrency payment offerings, are forthcoming.  The collaboration with Mintsy follows a bumpy onramp period for the newly purchased mining rental service. BetaRigs experienced operational problems following the change in ownership and subsequent platform upgrades and began issuing refunds to affected customers last week.

The full post  stressed that the owners were stepping away from the business due to unspecified personal reasons, and that they were unable to approach WoodWallets with the “same level of passion and dedication”.  The post recalls the origins of the project, which began one year ago after owner Nico issued a post on Reddit, before detailing how the owners want to move forward with the sale.  Nico writes:  ”We would be more than happy to leave everything we built so far in the hands of a company or an individual who is capable of running it with the same level of passion – possibly even more – that we kept during this year.”  Nico went on to speculate that the alternative would be to allow the project to become another “boring online shop”, one that would lack the community spirit that he contends led to the sale of hundreds of Woodwallets.  CoinDesk received a specialty version of the Woodwallet this summer, at the time noting its careful and artful packaging, and elegant design.

Introduced on 18th February by state Senator Steven Dickerson, a Republican from Nashville, the aim of Senate Bill 647 is to amend Tennessee Code to accommodate digital currency as an approved payment method. The bill would effectively add “digital currency” so that it is considered a valid monetary contribution to campaigns.  Addressing why the bill is necessary, Dickerson painted the measure as one that would support the FEC’s wider ruling last year.  Dickerson told CoinDesk:  ""That ruling applies to federal elections. There was possible ambiguity as far as state races. This bill would remove any ambiguity.""  Dickerson went on to state that he intends to try to pass the bill in the Senate, before it moves to the House of Representatives. SB 647 must pass both chambers and be signed by the state governor to become law.  Sale before use  The bill would have no impact on the donation limits imposed by the FEC, but in current form, would require candidates to sell digital currency before they spend the funds.  Still, Dickerson said this part of the bill is “up for debate”.  “If a vendor would provide a candidate goods or services that could be paid for with bitcoin, that might be an option. This bill may or may not be amended,” he added.  Dickerson said he is now moving forward on gathering a list of witnesses that will provide testimony about the bill before any relevant senate committees. Further, he estimated the event could be held within the next two to three weeks.

42378007,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lreh,1424465452,BTER Unable to Repay Customers Following Alleged Exchange Heist,"Defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTER claims it doesn't have enough funds to reimburse all its users, following an alleged seven-figure hack.  The Chinese exchange closed earlier this week, issuing a statement via its website that 7,170 BTC had disappeared from its offline wallet – around $1.75m at press time.  Speaking to CoinDesk, a BTER spokesperson claimed CNY and USD withdrawals would resume within a week. However, the company said it is still exploring different options to make all its customers whole, including selling the platform.  ""Hopefully a qualified party (especially a trusted security team) will take charge of it in the future,"" the spokesperson said.  Second hack in six months  Twitter users expressed disappointment and suspicion following the closure, which marks the exchange's second high-profile breach in six months. In August BTER lost 50m NXT, then worth around $1.65m, which, according to reports, was partially returned following negotiations with the hacker.  This time, reimbursement of the platform’s various cryptocurrencies, including NXT and counterparty, remains uncertain. The spokesperson simply reiterated the company's earlier Twitter announcement that withdrawals would be running ""soon"", after BTER's wallets are declared safe.  The individual did not provide further clues as to how the company's cold wallet was allegedly compromised, adding only that ""the trading platform was never affected but we need to make sure the wallet environment is safe for withdrawals"".  Vigilante bounty    According to its Weibo post, the exchange has reported the incident to local authorities. Additionally, the company said a 750 BTC bounty is on the table for vigilante hackers willing to ""chase back"" the stolen funds, which the exchange claims documented in this transaction.      The spokesperson said BTER's team were following up a number of bounty hunters' leads: ""Got a lot of useful information from our users. We are working on it.""      If verified, the BTER hack is the second biggest this year, following the £5.1m that vanished after Bitstamp’s hot wallet was compromised in January.      Hong Kong company MyCoin, which made headlines this month with rumours of a possible $386.9m hack (over 10% of bitcoins currently in circulation), is now believed to be a ponzi scheme that did not hold digital currency at all.

42378009,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LrhD,1424461537,Bitcoin Poker Site Seals With Clubs Closes After Security Compromise,"Bitcoin poker website Seals With Clubs has announced that it is shutting down.  In a notice posted on its website, Seals With Clubs cited security issues but did not disclose the specific events that led to the decision.  The site has experienced security problems in the past, having been the target of a database hack in December 2013 that resulted in the theft of 42,000 passwords.  Seals With Clubs stated that withdrawals will be available and advised all users to not deposit any bitcoins. Describing the situation as one constituting “a perpetual state of jeopardy”, Seals With Clubs said that the result was a decision by the company owners and operating staff.  The company noted on its website:  “All player funds and data remain intact and the issue was not software related. We do not believe any of our bitcoin wallets used in operations to be compromised or lost. However, this event has made the majority vote of the ownership and team agree that shutting down operations is the best move for safety and security purposes.”  The poker site said that the problems emerged on 11th February.  At the time, Seals With Clubs reported an unspecified hardware failure on Twitter, and despite assurances it would come back online, Seals With Clubs said it was forced to remain closed.  The website has been processing cash outs and apologized to its customer base amid what it called “extended downtime” on 15th February.  Future uncertain  Seals With Clubs did not elaborate on how long withdrawals will remain available, according to the notice, but claimed that its ability to offer withdrawals could be disrupted if its domain is seized or the operators’ ability to communicate is interrupted.  “Any unsigned or invalidly signed instructions by others should not be considered legitimate,” the notice read.  Seals With Clubs announced that, as part of the closure, some assets owned by the company will be transferred to chairman Bryan Micon in order to facilitate the creation of a new bitcoin poker platform based in Antigua.  The majority of those behind the site will not be involved with the future project, according to the notice. Micon alluded to the new poker platform dubbed SwC 2.0 in a Twitter post hours after the shutdown was announced.  The assets include a partially complete bitcoin poker software package that was previously intended to replace the original Seals With Clubs platform. Other assets, such as the site’s main domain space, social media and email accounts, will be retained in order to facilitate customer withdrawals.

42378005,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LrdR,1424442371,No Winners as Bitcoin Foundation Election Ends in Runoff,"An election to fill two individual member seats at the Bitcoin Foundation has ended without a clear winner, voting results show.  The Bitcoin Foundation reports that none of the 13 candidates received at least 50% of the vote from foundation members, a development that will result in another round of voting.  Participants in the run-off election will include entrepreneur Olivier Janssens, former foundation global policy counsel Jim Harper, Atlantic Financial’s Bruce Fenton and Michael Perklin of the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4), each of whom received at least 30% of the vote.  Janssens finished first in the poling, capturing 46.7% of the 323 votes, while Harper elicited 41.2% of the voting. Fenton and Perklin finished third and fourth, with 30.9% and 30% of the vote, respectively.  Elsewhere, Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham, who placed third in last year's election, finished with just 17.9% of the vote. Cody Wilson, who ran on a platform to disband the organisation entirely, captured a 21.3% share. Eligible voters were able to vote for more than one candidate.  The election aims to fill the two individual member seats left vacant by outgoing executive director Jon Matonis and chief scientist Gavin Andresen, who will continue to oversee the foundation’s development efforts.  The runoff election will begin on Tuesday, 24th February. Winners will be announced on 28th February via the foundation's blog.  Registration reopened for runoff  Following criticism that the foundation did little to encourage eligible voters to participate in the election, the trade organisation is allowing lifetime members to enroll once more for the runoff.  Candidates, including runoff participants Harper and Fenton, had been the most vocal about the organisation’s push to raise awareness for the event. Of the 1,523 eligible voters, only 13% turned out to vote.  Registration for the second round of voting begins today and will run through 23rd February at 11:59pm EST. This marks the second consecutive election in which the initial voting period has ended in a runoff vote.  Correction: A previous version of this article indicated the foundation had 2,728 eligible voters. This figure has been corrected.

42378021,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lrv3,1424441001,Blockai Launches 'Netscape for Bitcoin' With Blockchain Browser,"“It was awkward and it was a viral loop. People tipped $150,000 in 10 days, and then a lot of people who got bitcoin... it sat there and they didn’t do anything with it, ever.”  Blockai CEO Nathan Lands is referring to the spike in interest in first bitcoin project, QuickCoin, a Facebook-integrated wallet that sought to entice new users. That project has now evolved into Blockai (pronounced 'block-i'), which takes a similar approach to spreading bitcoin, although it places more emphasis on the capabilities of its blockchain rather than its use as a digital currency.  While resembling a social stream – more of a “frontpage for the blockchain” according to Lands – Blockai is a single application that seeks to merge a traditional Internet browser with a publishing tool. Using Blockai, users can read and comment on messages embedded into bitcoin blockchain metadata and also write and share their own creations.  The end result, according to Lands, is that Blockai will help people find the blockchain, while allowing them to easily visualize its capabilities beyond bitcoin as a currency.  Lands explained:  “If you’re trying to figure out what is the blockchain and how to use it, you’re going to need to be able to interact with different applications on there with a single place, versus having to go out and search how to use this protocol.”  To start, users will be able to post permanent messages, sign and timestamp documents and declare their love on the blockchain using Blockai’s tools. Once users create an account they select a username and add a profile photo, before adding funds to their wallet address.  Perhaps most critically, it also includes a social sharing button and 'love button' that enables content creators to reward each other with tweets and micropayments.  Lands went on to describe the project as one that could become a “trojan horse for bitcoin”, solving issues that led to difficulties with his first venture.  “QuickCoin was amazing at getting bitcoin to people, but then there was nothing, it would die right there. You have to do something that’s a lot more meaningful,” Lands said.  Building Blockai  On a technical level, Blockai is a fully functioning bitcoin web wallet that is also used for reading and interpreting confirmed bitcoin blocks. This means that what users see on its colorful screen is a stream of the bitcoin network’s metadata.  Blockai’s wallet software then runs in the browser and posts via a third-party blockchain API. Transactions are scanned and confirmed by its servers.  “Everything you read or write on Blockai are full on-chain bitcoin transactions and we hold no privileged position. Anyone could create their own software that reads and writes the same data,” explained Blockai CTO William Cotton.  To use the service, users send bitcoin to their Blockai wallet at no cost, although the price for sending messages and time-stamping documents is set at a price of 10 bits (around $0.002).  As for how much control users have over the wallet, Cotton indicated it is now not possible for users to import or export private keys to another application, though he said such functionality could be added this year.  “We'd rather not give our users the option to import keys until we're assured that we've got a secure solution in place,” Cotton added.  Visualizing the blockchain  Lands is keen to position Blockai as a Netscape-type breakthrough, referring to the pioneering browser that is credited with helping the world discover the potential of the Internet.  “We want to show the world how to use the blockchain,” Lands said of the beta version of Blockai. “Obviously it’s a browser in terms of we’re digitizing the blockchain as a stream.”  Over time, Lands sees Blockai evolving into more of an app store, allowing users to potentially discover other bitcoin applications and more easily understand how they are used with the help of a visual aid.  “If your idea is you want to submit a document, maybe that’s how you’re going to use it. But different people are going to use it in different ways, the same way people are going to use the iPhone in different ways for different applications that are relevant to them,” Lands added.  The Blockai team intend to keep their approach to the project open, and while they have ideas for new applications, Lands indicated they would be keen to respond to user feedback so that the service could evolve organically.  Big ideas  Throughout the interview, Lands stressed that Blockai is only in beta, meaning that the initial set of capabilities it enables are more novelties, examples of how the service could evolve, and thus not indicative of its potential usefulness.  For example, Lands noted his background at gamification startup Gamify, as well as Cotton’s prior experience in the music industry as factors that would influence how Blockai intends to diversify in the coming months.  [post-quote]  Regardless of the service, however, the intent is that Blockai enables content creators to use the blockchain as a means of publishing, so that the viral growth that propels social platforms can bring added attention to the blockchain.  “We don’t have a lot of viral features in there yet, but obviously it’s going to be improved,” Lands said, arguing that, whatever the service adds, these tools will at least appeal to users who may not have been persuaded to investigate bitcoin as a currency.  “I really think that not everyone is going to get into bitcoin because of speculation,” he explained. ""You can send bitcoin to someone with no purpose, but I think those things are going to result in bitcoin spreading at an OK rate, versus if you try to give people interesting things to do with bitcoin and then invite them to spread it.”  'Drop in the pond'  Given that Blockai is seeking to take advantage of bitcoin’s metadata, however, the service is likely to stir up debate regarding whether the blockchain should be used principally for financial use cases.  For instance, critics have long argued that non-financial uses 'bloat' or spam the blockchain with unnecessary transactions. However, Cotton and Lands don’t see their service as one that will be problematic for the network as a whole.  “We're currently not doing anything to prevent either spam or bloat, as neither have really become an issue just yet,” Cotton said. “There are only around 17,400 total transactions with OP_RETURN data. These transactions account for around 700kb of data embedded in 16mb of transactions. This is a drop in the pond compared to the rest of the blockchain.”  Nonetheless, they acknowledged their methods might be controversial, adding that they’ll be “actively monitoring” the effects of their service on the blockchain when such issues “become more than just speculation”.  Of course, given that Blockai is making metadata visible in the blockchain, there arises concerns about whether bitcoin users would be unknowingly making certain materials discoverable to the tool’s users.  Lands said that while, in theory, users could have the option to hide metadata transactions from Blockai, such a capability is not yet on the horizon for the product. First, the project will look to implement filtering features for users, so they can uncover more relevant information on the blockchain.  “They'll start off with simple filters, which we'll be implementing pretty soon,” Lands said. He added that, as with Internet browsers before it: ""Over time we'll want to give you better ways to see more relevant data.""

The new operation, with the address Coinarch.cn, will be named 币琪 (pronounced 'bi-qi'). Coinarch is now in the process of registering a local subsidiary and aims to be perceived as a local company, in order to better challenge established competitors like Huobi, OKCoin and BTC China.  Coinarch's team will also maintain a presence on popular Chinese social networks like Weibo, WeChat and QQ.  The new drive is one of the most substantial moves yet into the Chinese cryptocurrency trading market by an overseas company. Coinarch's co-founders are Australian nationals, while the company is registered in Singapore.  International availability  The Coinarch platform accepts bitcoin only and does not trade in any fiat currencies. This frees the firm from much regulation and makes the service available to all international customers. The company's prioritizing of China with its branding and marketing effort also reflects that market's potential significance.  The service is already available in English, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabic and Indonesian. Rival derivatives platform BTC.sx features interface options for both Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Russian, Spanish and Polish.  Coinarch CEO Jeremy Glaros said his company had ""received a lot of interest from the Chinese market"" since it launched and was glad to seize the opportunity.  Trading products  Coinarch's two main offerings are the leveraged trading product 'Booster' and the reverse-convertible investment product 'Maximiser'. Both are designed to be easy to understand and simple for relative beginners, yet also have advanced interface options for more experienced traders.  Coinarch will lure Chinese traders with more attractive conditions, Glaros added, with measures to protect traders' profits.  He said:  ""Unlike some alternative bitcoin trading products, our leverage products are not subject to scale-backs, meaning you retain 100% of the profits you earn in all market conditions. This is a huge differentiator in the bitcoin trading arena.""  A scale-back, or 'socialized profits' is when an exchange removes some funds from winning traders' profits to cover a 'system loss', which has caused consternation among Chinese bitcoin traders in the past.  Coinarch would now focus on building the ""next generation of bitcoin-linked products,"" Glaros said, to provide speculators in the bitcoin space the tools to manage their risks and tailor returns.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/20/bitcoin-derivatives-trading-platform-coinarch-expands-into-china,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0107db44ab6deb278def3821feaf9ad7efd7a82d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
