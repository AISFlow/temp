42426225,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGERh,1420236331,"Bitcoin Mining Pools Attack When Threatened, Study Finds","A new research paper argues that bitcoin mining pools can only co-exist peacefully if individual miners regularly switch pools and if pools erect sufficient defenses against attacks.  If pools don't exhibit either of those properties, then they are liable to attack each other, the report finds.  The paper's authors, Aron Laszka, Benjamin Johnson and Jens Grossklags, investigated the long-term effects of competition between bitcoin mining pools in a draft version of a study titled, 'When Bitcoin Mining Pools Run Dry'.  The final version of the paper will be presented at the Workshop on Bitcoin Research at this year's Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference in Puerto Rico on 30th January.  The paper uses game theory to look at the impact of attacks between two theoretical mining pools. One pool is deemed more 'attractive' than the other, whereby myriad factors like fees, technical structure or public relations savvy find it well-regarded among miners and investors.  How the game works  Pools may spend resources on ""productive"" or ""destructive"" investments.  In the former, a pool would add to its overall computing power, trying to beat competitors. A destructive investment, in turn, could come in the form of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on a rival that reduces that entity's computing power.  The authors devised a game consisting of two players: a bigger mining pool and a smaller pool. In each round of the game, the pools can either attack each other or not. Over time, the size of each pool should be affected by the attacks, as miners choose to ""migrate"" from one pool to another.  The game was set up to discover two things, according to the paper:  ""We study two important questions: the conditions under which the mining pools have no incentives to launch attacks against each other, and the conditions under which one mining pool is annihilated by the attacks.""  Among the findings were signs that pools were capable of cohabitation if individual miners swapped mining pools often and each pool had in place defensive measures that ensured an attack would be too costly for the other side to mount.  Peace can also be achieved between rival pools if either or both pools showed a low level of attractiveness. In practice, the authors write, this means that neither pool would attack the other if they were both busy trying to entice miners to join them.  When mining pools attack  When miners are actively migrating and defensive counter-measures aren't in place, then the likelihood of an attack increases.  Additionally, the attack will probably come from the less attractive pool. This is because the less attractive pool has more to gain from an attack, whereas the more attractive pool has less reason to change the status quo.  The other scenario in which an attack takes place is when one pool is highly attractive to miners and the other is not, again causing the less attractive entity to strike and ostensibly drive miners to process blocks in their corner of the network.  The attack scenarios contain a silver lining for the bitcoin network, the authors say, as such actions can act as a regulating force that keeps hashing power distributed.  They noted:  ""While attacks are generally harmful to the bitcoin ecosystem, they have positive effects in this context, as they prevent one pool from growing too large.""  The authors highlight two earlier studies that examine competition dynamics between mining pools.  An earlier paper by the same authors, plus Marie Vasek and Tyler Moore, used game theory to look the short-term effects of mining pool attacks. In the short-term, large pools are likely to be both targets and aggressors, that paper found.  Another paper, by Vasek, Moore and Micah Thornton, found 7% of all mining pools had experienced at least one DDoS attack between 2011 and 2013, and that big pools were more likely to be attacked than small ones.  Both papers were presented at the inaugural Workshop on Bitcoin Research held in 2014.

42426215,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGE5h,1420219099,Cody Wilson Speaks Out on Campaign to Dismantle Bitcoin Foundation,"Anarchist activist Cody Wilson has officially launched his candidacy for the upcoming Bitcoin Foundation board elections, and reaffirmed his intention to try and disband the organization from within if successful.  Wilson nominated himself with a post on the foundation's forums on 20th December and has also launched a website to support his campaign.  A staunch opponent of bitcoin regulation or centralization, Wilson is also best known for co-founding Defense Distributed, a donor-funded nonprofit organization that designs and distributes plans for the 3D-printed 'Liberator' pistol and 'Ghost Gunner' CNC milling machine.  He was also part of the founding team of DarkWallet, the project to make bitcoin transaction anonymization easy for everyday users.  ""I will run on a platform of the complete dissolution of the Bitcoin Foundation and will begin and end every single one of my public statements with that message,"" Wilson said in November when he first announced his intention to run.  Notably, the Bitcoin Foundation's November announcement that it would wind down its education, outreach and public policy efforts to focus on developing bitcoin's software core appears not to have weakened his campaign.  Wilson's recently posted manifesto also does not hold back on its combative rhetoric and disdain for the foundation, with its introduction that states:  ""This Bitcoin Foundation ... was always an embarrassing exercise in bad faith and state philosophy. It was always a vessel for frauds and second-rate minds to collude against the public. I invite you now to its ritual sacrifice.""  Elections will be held 13-19th February for the individual board seats being vacated by outgoing executive director Jon Matonis and current chief scientist Gavin Andresen. Election committee chair Brian Goss posted an acknowledgement that nominations including Wilson's had been received. Official confirmations will be posted mid-January.  The foundation board also voted in November to retire the Founding Member seat of chairman Peter Vessenes, to be replaced with an International Chapter Director Seat to represent non-US affiliates. The goal is to eventually have a board 100% elected by foundation members.  Structure is the problem  Speaking to CoinDesk, Wilson said his complaint is not with any individual or group within the foundation, but the structure of the organization itself.  The problem with the Bitcoin Foundation goes all the way back to its inception and original mission, Wilson said, adding:  ""The best way to help your business is to be part of a trade group and lobby Congress for preferential or beneficial regulation.""  Rather than forming a body to standardize and protect an open-source technology a la the Linux Foundation, he said, the Bitcoin Foundation gave itself a wider role with lobbying power and creation of global policy strategies.  Incoming executive director Patrick Murck promised a new era of openness and consultation with the foundation's constituents, and conducted surveys into what members wanted most. This led to the promise to focus only on bitcoin's technology.  This refocus on development only, however, is superficial and there is no meaningful break with its current incarnation, Wilson believes. He notes that public statements have not changed the foundation's by-laws, its established channels of communication or its affiliate programs around the world.  Even if current leaders are sincere, those in the near or longer-term future could simply come in and pick up the threads previous lobbying efforts have left in place, he said.  Early actions  When bitcoin's price shot up around April 2013 and began to appear in mainstream headlines, often in association with operations like Silk Road, regulators also started to take a much closer interest.  In response, advocacy groups, including the Bitcoin Foundation, hurried to reassure the authorities that the technology and most businesses were legitimate.  Had it not done so, some say, government moves to further marginalize or even block access to bitcoin may have ensued.  Wilson disagrees, and says the foundation's founders were also too fast to reveal bitcoin's potential and seek to negotiate it with regulators.  He said:  ""It was the first self-annointed evangelists of bitcoin who were also the people that started this foundation. I just think it was such a critical kind of betrayal, because they gave the security state all the briefings on the technology, where we could've [had] one, maybe two, more years of freedom to experiment.""  'Serious' campaign  Despite the rhetoric, the candidacy is not meant to be flippant or overly negative, Wilson said, and he intends to ""give other candidates a run for their money"".  ""Like in most of my endeavors, I don't know enough to know if it's impossible.""  He has been conversing with other former members of the foundation who have become disillusioned with the its recent direction, he said. This could potentially bring a contingent of energized participants to the election who wouldn't have been involved otherwise.  Wilson expects outside criticism of his campaign, or even challenges to his legitimacy via the foundation's own bylaws, should he be elected.  However, it is a serious campaign, he stresses, saying it is legally possible while abiding by all the current rules. He would take his seat and does not wish other members to simply turn him away at the first board meeting.  Bitcoin without a foundation  But can bitcoin still succeed without a public face to argue for its legitimacy?  That depends on your definition of success, Wilson said, adding that in terms of acceptance and use, bitcoin's superiority over existing financial technology would see it make gains without formal help.  He said:  ""Most of the critical innovations in finance so far have just happened ... e-mail didn't need a foundation, it just took over the Internet like a wildfire, it was so superior to mailing a letter.""  Wilson would like to start a debate about what 'bitcoin's success' actually means to different people, he said. He does not view success as bitcoin merely becoming an ""under the hood lubricant for other financial transactions"", unseen by users.  Instead, it represents a kind of singularity that entails whole new political ways of being, new economic modes, rebellion.  Making ""Faustian bargains"" with regulatory powers would ultimately limit what can be achieved with bitcoin politically, even if the software remained capable of fulfilling Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision.  Jim Harper's alternate view  Jim Harper was the Bitcoin Foundation's Global Policy Counsel from March to December 2014, and is a senior fellow at libertarian think-tank the Cato Institute. Disagreeing with the foundation's decision to withdraw from public policy and education, he left his job there and is now also running for a board position.  He posted on the Bitcoin Foundation forums that he did not agree with Wilson's approach, and suggested it was more about provocation and drawing attention to the cause than for the good of bitcoin – but also that such discussion ""shouldn't be off the table"".  Harper told CoinDesk that the foundation instead needs stability before it can again be a credible public policy voice or educational resource. While he has his own vision for the foundation's return to a policy role, it would require a consensus of the board.  ""Let's make sure there's a solid organization that has fundraising in place to support all its work, then we might regrow the organization into roles that many of us joined expecting the Foundation to do.""  Bitcoin can certainly exist without a foundation, Harper added, but a well-run foundation can help speed its adoption wordwide.  ""Education and public policy work can increase direct adoption and position conventional financial services companies to help deliver bitcoin's benefits to billions of people.""  Growing the bitcoin ecosystem this way would do nothing to prevent bitcoin from developing independently at the same time, he said. There need not be a conflict between those parts of the bitcoin community interacting with regulators, and others developing the ecosystem independent of government regulatory systems.  Innovation is more uncomfortable  Wilson compared bitcoin pioneers to those of the 1990s' 'cryptography wars' who went to court and risked jail terms for creating technology like remailers and data encryption software PGP, as well as his own work with Defense Distributed.  He said:  ""Yes, it's more uncomfortable. You don't make as much money. If you want to start a bitcoin business you might run afoul of the SEC. But making these direct overtures to [regulators], without even being solicited, that seems to me to be a betrayal of the goodwill and political capital of early bitcoin.""  Wilson acknowledges that there is considerable anger and outrage in the words he's written in his campaign manifesto, but insists it is not his intent to be punitive.  I don't believe it's purely about punishing the foundation for what it's done; it's about recognizing it and hopefully inviting whatever libertarian or anarchist segment of bitcoin is left and activating it.""  CoinDesk spoke to the Bitcoin Foundation, but its leadership declined to comment other than saying anyone had a right to campaign on the platform of their choice and that the organization did not want to interfere in the electoral process.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/02/cody-wilson-speaks-out-on-campaign-to-dismantle-bitcoin-foundation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/379bc3e50d8a8723c67192f99c2d3b7c04049ccf-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426228,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGEVh,1420209462,"Bitcoin Bowl Merchants See Tech's Big Picture, But Few Sales","The Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl may have given bitcoin a visibility boost on primetime TV, but according to local merchants who participated in its promotion, this attention didn’t always translate into an increase in local sales or customer interest.  As part of our Bitcoin Bowl coverage, CoinDesk surveyed more than 20 St Petersburg merchants about their experience supporting the event, though more were approached for comment. BitPay had said that more than 100 businesses in total signed up to accept bitcoin for the big game.  The poll sought information about the total sales recorded by merchants in and around the event; whether customers inquired about bitcoin; why they participated in the promotion and whether they would recommend it to others and why.  Perhaps most notably, just three of the merchants contacted reported that they saw more than 10 sales before the day of the game. In addition, of those who did see a sales boost during the event weekend, just one indicated a significant number of transactions.  While few merchants reported more than a handful of sales, most seemed optimistic about the technology and its perceived benefits.  More than half (13 respondents), said they would recommend the payment method to another merchant; a further 15 said they found BitPay’s system easy to use.  Most, like Windworks owner Joe Fala, seemed to appreciate the additional sales, even if he only processed three or so transactions in each of his stores before the event, and a similar number during the event weekend.  Fala summed up the mixed view many merchants expressed, stating:  ""All in all I was happy with it considering I didn't know what to expect. Honestly, I had never heard of it, and it doesn't cost me anything to keep it.""  Overall, the findings suggest that though bitcoin’s core value proposition may be appealing to businesses, a notable number of local merchants are unsure about whether they would proceed with the payment method given the results they reported.  Standout showing for Ferg’s Sports Bar  The big sales winner for the event was perhaps unsurprisingly Ferg’s Sports Bar and Grill, the local pub that played host to the official UCF Tailgate Party, as well as the post-game ESPN VIP tailgate, which was attended by BitPay staff.  Ferg’s reported completing more than 100 sales over the three months before game day, with an undisclosed number completed at the 15 bars operated by the venue to keep up with demand.  Owner Mark Ferguson, who also sits on the bowl game’s official board, lauded the payment option for delivering “a lot” of sales, stating:  “We were surprised by how many people wanted to pay with bitcoin. We think it’s a great concept, and we love it as a merchant. No chargebacks, no transaction fees and you advertise for us. Great!""  Another representative at the company suggested much of this demand may have been from existing bitcoin users, however, not necessarily first-time users.  “Most people who ask us already have bitcoin and are familiar with how it works,” company general manager Peter Hodgdon said. “We wouldn’t be the ones they would ask, they would ask bitcoin about that.”  Expectations influence perception  Others like Carolyn Brayboy, co-owner of Chief’s Creole Cafe, expected a similar boost in business, but did not record any sales before, during or after the game.  “We're anticipating we'll be getting some customers coming in and using it,” Brayboy said on the day of the game, adding that she believed bitcoin would help position her business on the ""progressive end"" of a new technology.  However, game-day came and went without any sales. “I didn't have anybody call to inquire about it,” Brayboy later said. Still, she is optimistic bitcoin might become a driver of business over time.  Rick Shook of Ricks’ Home Theatre Store was less phased about the lack of immediate return from bitcoin in terms of sales. He acknowledged that as a merchant that specializes in big-ticket items, he participated more as a way to show support for the community.  “It was more about setting it up and it was no cost,” Shook said. “I didn’t expect anything other than that I was supporting the bowl itself and the possibility of a transaction.”  “It’s like no harm, no foul,” he added.  Also of note was that many merchants had only recently begun accepting the payment option.  Some see day-of sales spike  Some stores, however, did report a day-of sales boost, suggesting the event did benefit select local merchants.  Plain Jane  , a small boutique, began accepting bitcoin two months before the event, recording only two transactions during this time.  That figure doubled over the weekend of the bowl game, owner Tom Shirkey said, but only to a total of four sales.  “It wasn't a surprise per se, but it was a spike, so I guess it was somewhat expected,” Shirkey said of the results, adding that he has “no complaints” about the service.  Beach Hair Affair  and Paper Street Market also reported slight upticks in sales. Craftsman House Gallery and The Edge Lounge and Tapas said weekend sales mirrored those observed in the run-up to the event, with a handful of completed transactions.  Ruffled feathers  Though most merchants were enthusiastic about the technology’s benefits and happy with even a small sales boost, a small number of merchants may have been put off by what they described as BitPay’s overzealous promotion of the event.  One merchant, who wished to be identified only as Ron, indicated that the promise that bitcoin would drive big game-day sales coupled with the lack of returns have lead him to cancel BitPay's service.  He told CoinDesk:  “I expected something, but we saw nothing. They told me there'd be an influx of people and we saw nothing.”  Leslie Curran, owner of the local fine art shop ARTicles expressed a similar disappointment in her remarks, noting the determination of the BitPay team to enroll new merchants.  “The reason we decided was because they were relentless about coming by and asking if we'd sign up for it, that's the bottom line,” she said, adding that she liked the concept of a payment option without unnecessary transaction fees.  ARTicles reported no bitcoin sales before, on the day of or after the game.  Advertising and promotion  About one-fifth of the merchants surveyed also expressed some willingness to benefit from the free advertising bitcoin could bring.  Elsewhere, merchants lauded BitPay’s dedication to helping them set up the technology, with a number noting that in-person visits were effective at encouraging them to enroll. Customer demand and the low processing fees for bitcoin payments were also factors for some merchants.  However, a desire to support the event itself was found to be the chief motivating factor.  Matt Bonano, owner of restaurant and imported food dealer Brooklyn South, suggested that for his relatively new restaurant, this was a compelling value proposition. He further expressed only some interest in bitcoin as a payment method, evoking the ‘Why not?’ mentality of many other merchants.  Bonano said:  “The game is called the 'Bitcoin.com bowl' or whatever and it's right across the street, so if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.""

42426213,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGDzh,1420203879,Mike Hearn: How Bitcoin's Technology Advanced in 2014,"In just a few days, bitcoin will have been in development for six years.  For those of us who watched it grow from a humble Windows-only desktop application to today’s global infrastructure, bitcoin’s technology is simultaneously astonishing and frustrating. We marvel at how far it’s come, and yet are impatient with how far it still has to go.  Most media stories reviewing bitcoin’s 2014 focus exclusively on the price. So, instead, let’s take a look at what we achieved as a community this year, and take a look ahead at where things might go in 2015.  Nailing the basics  Bitcoin 0.1 was a prototype designed to show Satoshi’s new algorithm could work. It didn’t have any security features, there wasn’t any convenient way to back up your wallet and, even though preventing double spends was fundamental to what bitcoin did, the app wouldn’t actually tell you if a double spend had occurred.  A lot of the time since has been spent on making the basics of being your own bank easy and safe. An attack on the peer-to-peer network in February prompted wallet developers to upgrade their support for showing double spends in their user interfaces.  Mainstream wallets signiﬁcantly reduced the quantity of random numbers they need – although this change may seem obscure, such wallets are easier to back up, safer and tend to give users better privacy.  This year also saw massive progress on one of the most pressing issues facing bitcoin technology: security. Seeds planted in previous years started to bear fruit.  SatoshiLabs successfully launched the ambitious Trezor project, bringing better-than-banking-grade security to bitcoiners who are willing to buy the keyring-attachable device. Wider support from more wallet apps should arrive in 2015.  Bitpay  ’s Copay project developed a multisig wallet for desktop, web and mobile that supports money controlled by social groups, like a board of directors, or parties in a dispute mediated transaction.  And a new wallet simply called Bitcoin Authenticator entered developer testing; it provides decentralised two-factor authentication between desktops/laptops and Android smartphones.  Reinforcing the core  One theme I’ve talked about constantly in the last 18 months was the lack of resources being put into development of Bitcoin Core, and shared infrastructure more generally. Luckily the community rallied around, and in 2014 things got signiﬁcantly better.  The Bitcoin Foundation announced a pivot towards core development and hired two extra developers who now handle the daily tasks of running the Core project. This allows Gavin Andresen to focus on longer-term planning and research.  The foundation is funding Sergio Damien Lerner to do security audits, Saïvann Carignan to continue his independent development of bitcoin.org and Addy Yeow to run a network metrics service. And most of the remaining core developers who weren’t already working on bitcoin full time joined Blockstream, a company that raised $21 million from investors with an explicit mandate to focus on building the ecosystem and infrastructure.  At the start of 2014, our problem was that we were running a multi-billion dollar ﬁnancial infrastructure on top of software that had fewer full time developers than Google’s April Fool jokes. The Foundation was (very reasonably) splitting its effort between development and defending bitcoin in Washington. At the end of 2014, there are now dedicated groups lobbying for us all around the world, and all the people who worked on the protocol and software in previous years can keep doing so.  Our challenge now is using our newfound resources wisely. Most Silicon Valley companies have product managers: people who tell the developers what to do and (in theory) ensure they focus on the real needs of real users instead of things that are fun to implement. Bitcoin doesn’t have anything like that – so we’ll have to make sure we stay focused on mainstream success ourselves.  Getting ready for a great 2015  Bitcoin is a long-term project, so the theme of plans being laid years in advance is common. What might we see next year? Here are a few things already in development that I’m hoping to see in the next 12 months (though I can offer no guarantees):  New cross-platform and decentralised wallets• Bitcoin Authenticator with Android-based two-factor authentication• MultiBit HD, the followup to the popular MultiBit Classic. A new UI, wallet words, Trezor support and fully deterministic.  A better core protocol: more scalable and with the annoying malleability quirks ﬁnally removed.  StrawPay, a new 'hub and spoke' method of routing micropayments that builds on the payment channel implementation work done in 2013 by myself and Matt Corallo. Payment channel networks provide a way to rapidly route tiny micropayments around in a fast and secure way that is off the blockchain, but still uses the bitcoin protocol.  … and ﬁnally, of course, the launch of my own project for the last eight months: Lighthouse, an open-source app for all-or-nothing bitcoin crowdfunding.  Ultimately, people will buy bitcoins for the useful things they can do. If the last ﬁve years were about putting the basics in place, let’s make the next ﬁve about solving real problems for the person on the street.

42426224,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGELh,1420195064,How to Avoid Bitcoin Scams in 2015,"2014 has been a monumental year for bitcoin in many respects.  Consumer adoption rose significantly and a host of retailers, including huge global corporations, decided to take the plunge into digital currency. What's more, regulators have started to reveal increased understanding of the technology and bitcoin's blockchain is widely being recognised as a truly innovative technology.  But it has not all been good news.  The February collapse of Mt Gox, then the largest bitcoin exchange, shone light on the importance of wallet security and led to the increased adoption of multi-signature technology over the course of 2014.  Furthermore, even though the bitcoin ecosystem has evolved in the right direction, scams still crop up on a regular basis.  Fraudulent exchanges and cloud mining services, phishing schemes, pump-and-dump and IPO scams, and more, are ongoing security risks that cryptocurrency users face everyday. This week alone, three cloud mining services appear to have gone bankrupt.  So how can you avoid scams in the bitcoin space? While there is no sure-fire way to protect your holdings against technical attacks like these, here are some cautionary measures that will be helpful, offered by security experts in the industry.  1. See if the company has been publicly audited  A proof-of-reserves cryptographic audit is a good way to publicly disclose bitcoin holdings in a verifiable manner. The process can assure customers that the company is financially able to deliver on its end of the business deal.  George Avetisov is the CEO of HyprKey, a startup aiming to protect digital currency users from fraud by utilizing its HYPR-3 three-factor authentication protocol.  He said:  “Oftentimes you'll encounter a bitcoin startup claiming to provide something ridiculous like military-grade multisig quantum computer absolute-zero cold storage, when in fact a quick background check on the company reveals that they have neither the funding nor the resources to ever maintain such exotic security.”  2. If possible, do your own background checks  If you’re not handing your money to an established company like BitPay, Circle or Coinbase, don’t give it to a company that keeps its development team anonymous or an exchange whose owners you can’t trace. Companies should publicly disclose their officers’ identities and be legally registered to operate.  Rodrigo Souza, who heads New York-based technology platform BlinkTrade recommends googling a company’s WHOIS information. It should show the name under whom the company is registered and how long it has been on the market.  “It pretty much is a scam if it’s private,” he said. “Honest companies don't hedge their domain in the private world.”  CEO of multisig wallet provider BitGo, Will O’Brien, advised looking to online forums like Bitcoin Talk or Reddit to get a feel for the situation at hand.  “There are many active forums on which users discuss known or suspected scams, and prospective buyers should familiarize themselves with those before making a purchase or investment,” he said. “It's also preferable to get in touch with someone at the company via phone, or better in person, wherever possible.”  3. Look for transparency and best business practices  Lack of transparency opens doors for scams or mismanagement. Hence, exchanges should be as transparent as possible and prove their solvency if they’re going to protect against a Mt Gox scenario.  Souza recommended that reputable companies do their part to help customers more easily recognize best business practices.  In an effort for transparency, companies should attach disclaimers at the end of their emails assuring the recipients, he said. These should spell out that the company would never (or minimally) request private information through email, so the customer never has to worry about phishing scams.  “We always put that in the footer of the emails and the bigger companies should start pushing for that,” he said.  4. Recognize if a 'scam' is just mismanagement  Scams imply malicious intent. It happens all too often that bitcoin businesses turn out incompetent and poorly managed. However, they may have no intention to scam their customers.  “The difference between these two is a fuzzy line,” said Olaf Carlson Wee, head of risk at Coinbase, “as an incompetent business can be even more dangerous than a straightforward scam.”  Souza further explained: “People confuse poor marketing skills and poor development skills with scammers. It’s not intentional, it’s incompetence.”  HyprKey's Avetisov said bitcoin’s still largely negative public reputation is largely to do with the amount of scamming that takes place “by businesses that promise consumers everything from mining hardware to cold storage, only to steal their users' funds.”  He added:  “I think that while the immediate threat to the growth of bitcoin is cyber fraud, the more broad inhibitor of bitcoin adoption is the lack of faith in the companies building out this infrastructure.”  5. Don’t underestimate common sense  If what you're seeing is too good to be true, it is very likely to be a scam. That’s an attitude consistent among industry security experts.  “When buying mining hardware, always be sure to get a delivery date from the merchant, and make sure the merchant has a registered physical location and many happy customers,” Wee said.  Cornell University researcher Emin Gün Sirer suggested that no company should be taken at face value, saying:  “Assume that every new business model in the bitcoin space is a scam unless proven otherwise. Assume that every well-intentioned implementation is broken at its core, unless it has been publicly audited. Do not trust your keys and private information to anyone.”  Having someone else hold your private keys for you is almost always a bad idea, he added, as the blockchain has no ""account owners"" and transactions cannot be reversed. Since keys are the sole authentication mechanism, he said, “anyone holding keys on your behalf has all of your unbridled powers”.  Avetisov said bitcoin novices tend to forget that the digital currency is irreversible and may be too quick to hand theirs over to a third party.  “My advice to any beginner dabbling in cryptocurrency would be to treat it as they would treat cold hard cash,” he said.
