42376573,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W2wb,1375714681,Mt. Gox enhances site performance by partnering with cloud platform Akamai,"Mt. Gox has revealed a number of improvements it has made to its site and service plus a variety of changes it is set to implement in the near future.  The ' status updatehttps://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20130805.html' states the bitcoin exchange is now supported by cloud platform Akamai, which recently reported net income of $62 million for the second quarter of the year. The partnership means Mt. Gox is now hosted on thousands of servers across the world.  ""Not only does this massively increase our protection, but since the transition the performance and speed of mtgox.com has been greatly improved,"" the update reads.  Vladimir Marchenko, CTO at BTC Global, said: ""Akamai is basically a CDN [Content Distribution Network]. While it is a big and expensive CDN, it appears to be a rather trivial technical matter.""  The company also announced it has moved from being a hosted service to being entirely self-hosted at a co-located setup.  ""At this level, it is again a trivial technical matter and, frankly, given information security concerns, they should have been in 'colo' setup years ago,"" said Marchenko.  He was more positive about the company's new trading engine, which will be launched soon following a couple of hardware updates. Called Midas, the engine is being tested with over 500,000 trades per second (TPS), but it will be capable of processing a higher volume than this.  ""500,000 TPS is pretty close to what the best engines can do so this is good news, but again long overdue. It's quite an upgrade from their current order matching engine that, by some estimates, cannot handle more than 30-50 TPS,"" Marchenko explained.  Over the next few weeks, users will also notice some UX improvements, as some new interface designs are to be implemented.  Those waiting for Mt. Gox to offer Litecoin exchanges will have to wait a bit longer, as the company isn't yet ready to implement this digital currency. The rollout will happen soon, but Mt. Gox is reluctant to provide an exact launch date.  Last month, Litecoin founder Charles Lee told Coindesk: “Litecoin is becoming more popular and Mt. Gox has seen that they’re missing out on making money from litecoin, and that’s why they want to implement it.”  The company's announcement also confirms it is trying to negotiate new bank partnerships so it can speed up its transaction processes. Currently, it takes up to 10 days to process deposits because Mt. Gox's bank holds funds for 7-10 days before transferring them to the exchange's account.  ""This has always been the case, and we were still crediting customer accounts before receiving the funds ourselves, but some cases in which the bank subsequently rejected the deposits meant that we incurred significant losses. The risk is now too high for us to credit accounts prematurely,"" the statement reads.  Marchenko said it is interesting that Mt. Gox doesn't say anything about withdrawals in the statement. He thinks people will not believe the old adage that no news is good news: ""The punters are now justified to assume the worst about the withdrawals.""  Mt. Gox's announcement concludes by stating:    Over the last months our mission has not changed. We are fighting as always to improve our services despite setbacks, but our mission as always is to support the widespread adoption of Bitcoin as much as we can.      To accomplish the latter goal, we have a team focused on communicating the beauty of Bitcoin to the world with new websites and ad campaigns aimed at global markets (news on that soon). We thank you for all of your support, and look forward to sharing our projects very soon.    Mt. Gox still has work to do to win back the trust it has lost over the past few months, exemplified by payment processors such as BIPS switching away from it to Bitstamp - and Bitstamp itself making gains on Gox. However, continuing to issue updates does demonstrate an adherence to transparency and may well improve some users' opinions of the exchange.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LTC | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/05/mt-gox-enhances-site-performance-by-partnering-with-cloud-platform-akamai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16b14bde635c982c62e2636b47338c86e9e799cd-1000x666.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376578,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W32t,1375710713,Bitcoin Foundation funds DIY bitcoin wallet Coinpunk,"The Bitcoin Foundation has awarded its second 2013 grant to the bitcoin wallet project Coinpunk. Coinpunk, developed by Kyle Drake, is described as a DIY bitcoin wallet service that is intended for users to install on their own web server.  Coinpunk  is currently under heavy development, but already has ""features for individual users, developers, hardware wallet manufacturers and large organizations"", said the Bitcoin Foundation. The foundation also stated that it chose this project above the other entrants for this quarter's applicants because ""contribution to the usability of bitcoin overall, and its ability to serve as a base for a wide range of innovations in keeping with open source ideals.""  The Bitcoin Foundation awards are granted on a quarterly basis and focuses on projects that wouldn't otherwise be funded. This is the third round of grants. The foundation has awarded three development­-focused grants over the previous two quarters, with TestNet Faucet and DNS Seed for TestNet winning in Q1 this year.  Drake told us: ""I'm very happy that the Bitcoin Foundation has allowed me to continue work on the Coinpunk project. It's my hope that this project will help to improve the Bitcoin ecosystem, and improve accessibility for bitcoin. Our plan is to turn Coinpunk into a full-featured open source wallet service that anyone can use, whether they are power users, developers building a regional wallet service with special features, or organizations looking to run their own bitcoin 'bank'. I think it shows how strong the bitcoin community is, and that we will continue to improve the ecosystem to allow bitcoin to be used by everyone.""  Drake told us that there is a version of Coinpunk already available, but that he's currently in the process of building a major new version. ""I'm providing the option to move the security from the server to the browser side, which makes the server less like a bank that holds your money, and more like a safety deposit box it can't open, which increases trustability. I'm also focusing on building the tools developers need to make custom wallet services for solving specific problems or running exchanges in non-US countries with this technology.""  Drake isn't sure when the project will be finished, but noted that he wants the project to be stable before releasing the new version. He does, however, hope to have a release available by the end of late summer. ""It's a very ambitious project that's going to affect a lot of people, and I want to make sure we get things right. We want to provide a rich set of options and developer tools, so we can enable a web wallet ecosystem for working with bitcoin that hopefully becomes a strong community resource.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/05/bitcoin-foundation-funds-diy-bitcoin-wallet-coinpunk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6bfd71ae05f7c4ae1b08e7b3476b0aee1849ef0-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376591,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W3FT,1375699572,Online education site Khan Academy now accepts donations in bitcoin,"The Khan Academy now supports donations in bitcoins. The news was announced last week on Coinbase's blog, as the non-profit educational website is using the US company's merchant tools to accept bitcoin payments.  The Khan Academy offers a large range of educational resources. There are videos and exercises for students. Lessons are hosted on YouTube and offered up on the Khan Academy website in formatted courses. There's even a course about bitcoin, among all the other courses in world history, physics, mathematics, etc. There are also tools for tutors to interact with students.  According to Coinbase's blog post, you will earn a ""special badge"" on your profile page for making a donation to Khan Academy in bitcoin, in addition to the badges that students can earn for completing courses, etc.  A bitcoin supporter told us: ""It seemed only right that I should donate some BTC to Khan Academy for their excellent bitcoin tutorial videos. All I had to do was scan a QR code on the screen to send them a small donation of 0.05BTC. The donation process was smooth, and I was even awarded an 'I am Satoshi' badge for my trouble.""  Darragh Browne of Blockspin commented: ""This is great news as the Khan Academy is democratising education in the same way that bitcoin is democratising financial services. There is already a big tipping culture in the bitcoin community, so it's great to see the Khan Academy tapping into this. Hopefully, other non-profits will follow suit and adopt bitcoin as another revenue stream to receive appreciation for their work.""  The Khan Academy was founded by Salman Khan.

42376584,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W3Cx,1375697566,Looking inside BitEnsure: Bitcoin savings account or Ponzi scheme?,"Disclaimer: CoinDesk does not in any way endorse BitEnsure and is not qualified to offer financial advice. Any actions readers choose to take are at their own risk.  Update August 16, 2013:  BitEnsure has now announced that it is closing due to bad press. Its website now has the following message: ""Unfortunately, due to the timing of launching Bitensure and current news events the reception to Bitensure has been overwhelmingly negative. We do not see the potential that once existed in the idea of a Bitcoin Savings Account at this time. We are discontinuing the site.""  BitEnsure also confirmed that it would be returning all deposits in full.  We spoke to a BitEnsure customer who confirmed that (prior to the closure) BitEnsure had been active on its support forum and had been prompt in acknowledging receipt of deposits. The same customer also confirmed to us that they received their bitcoins back from BitEnsure. This person also confirmed that another customer he/she knew had also received a full refund.  --  Recently launched BitEnsure claims to be a new ""bitcoin savings account"". In the wake of the SEC's recent charging of Trendon Shavers for operating a bitcoin Ponzi scheme, it's a contentious claim. CoinDesk interviewed the founder to find out more.  BitEnsure promises guaranteed returns on set-term deposits of one bitcoin or more. The new company is backed by a team of traders and programmers who have been developing the Metaneural trading system for a number of years. We spoke to Metaneural's John Jones to find out how this bitcoin savings account works.  The people behind BitEnsure are primarily traders. BitEnsure is their attempt at branching out into the bitcoin world by offering a traditional savings account. The thought that may occur to many bitcoin enthusiasts is that a savings account is so far the preserve of fiat banks which operate on a fractional reserve system.  For those who don't know, fractional reserve banking is the process by where fiat banks do not hold sufficient funds to cover all of the deposits made by its customers. This is why the nightmare scenario for any bank is the classic ""run on the banks"" where nearly all the customers decide (usually in a state of panic) to withdraw their funds at once.  Jones stated that the company will not be using such a system, and customers effectively have a certificate of deposit and that the company has a cache of bitcoin to back up customer deposits. Jones also stated that in the event that the company has a catastrophic drain on its main bitcoin account, it has a backup of all customer deposits too.  BitEnsure also serves as a bitcoin mixing service. Jones told us the company never uses the same address twice, so it's almost impossible to track bitcoin through its system, given that bitcoins leave BitEnsure to fund the group's trading activities elsewhere. This provides an interesting option considering that BitEnsure charges no fees, compared to the Blockchain.info's mixing service that takes 0.5%.  To elaborate on the trading activities of the BitEnsure team, their other company is called Metaneural, which is (so I'm told) a neural network automated trading system. While other exchanges allow users to automate trades by placing buy and sell orders on an ""if this then that"" basis, Jones explained to me that Metaneural's system searches for patterns in the market and makes decisions on its own as to when it should enter and exit a market and with what volume. This software is sold to third-party clients. Metaneural's forex performance can be seen over on MyFXBook.com.  ""We have been using it for a few years now, but only made it public earlier this year. We like to test everything, obviously, just to make sure that it actually works and gives the profits that we profess. It's been in the works for a while and we're very proud of it.""  He went on to tell us: ""We're doing a little over 30% a year, which in the forex world doesn't sound like much, but when you get into the 140% or 1000% that a lot of other people are promising, it's probably not real. If you're being very safe and you're not over leveraging yourself, 30% is a very good profit margin for a year.""  As for what customers can expect, there is a minimum investment of 1 BTC. I asked Jones if this minimum would change, and he said that it would only change if bitcoin became super inflated, so as to not lock people out of the service.  The BitEnsure website shows that there are several saving plans, each with their own minimum fixed term. I asked Jones what would happen if a customer needed to urgently withdraw their funds. He answered that there is an emergency withdrawal system, where funds will be released during an active term, but will be subject to a penalty charge.  Understandably, there has been a somewhat negative reception to BitEnsure on the bitcoin forums, with several users suggesting that it is merely another scam.  Jones was quick to emphasise his company's transparency in response: ""I'd say it's really a trust sort of business that we're in. If we cheat our customers we can't continue to do business. I know the current news about the Ponzi scheme, which was called Bitcoin Savings and Trust, has made a lot of people very sceptical, which is totally understandable. But the difference between what he was doing and what we're doing is that we're a lot more transparent. We're telling you how much profit you're going to make, where it's coming from and we are an established business with a reputation. I'd say it comes down to giving it a try and trusting that we wouldn't put all this effort into something that we want to fail.""  As for customers ""giving it a try"", I asked Jones how many customers had signed up so far in the week since BitEnsure's launch and he replied ""over a hundred"".  Update August 6, 2013:  We should point out that when first interviewed John Jones, he was going by the name John Titor, which is what he is listed under on the MetaNeural website. Furthermore, it came to light after the interview that the profile photo above his name isn't actually his image, but an image of JP Rosenbaumhttp://www.wetpaint.com/the-bachelorette/articles/how-does-jp-rosenbaum-stay-so-businessman-hot-all-the-time. Jones explained to us that the use of a pseudonym was to protect his privacy, which may or may not explain the use of a fake photograph too. Either way, the obfuscation of identity in the people behind a money handling company will affect the level of consumer trust.  We would like to hear from customers of BitEnsure and to know what sort of service they experienced.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/05/looking-inside-bitensure-bitcoin-savings-account-or-ponzi-scheme,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb982da7d075083e581e652498db398ffbddce7f-500x282.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
