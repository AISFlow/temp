42393307,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOjcB,1686611329,SEC’s DeFi Rulemaking Do-Over Falls Short,"In April, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reopened the comment period for proposed set of rules that would redefine various blockchain protocols as U.S. regulated securities exchanges, a second try at reining in decentralized finance (DeFi) from early 2022.  The public has until Tuesday, June 13 to submit comments. And comment everyone should, because the fatal flaws of this proposal have only been exacerbated in this latest version.  Alongside the SEC’s enforcement-first mindset, this attempt at rulemaking serves as compelling evidence that new U.S. legislation – (perhaps something like the recently published market structure bill sponsored by House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) and Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn ""GT"" Thompson (R-PA) – is sorely needed.  Bill Hughes is senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters at ConsenSys.  Torturing the securities laws  The central problem with the SEC’s proposal is that trying to treat blockchain protocols as regulated exchanges simply cannot be squared with the Exchange Act of 1934, existing exchange regulations or an accurate understanding of blockchain technology. What would it mean for something like Ethereum to be treated as a securities exchange?  To set the scene, laws regarding securities exchanges were passed to address the risks inherent in intermediated systems that bring together the orders of actual buyers and sellers. The U.S. Congress sought to regulate exchanges only insofar as they were centralized entities that possess a uniquely important role in setting market prices and otherwise affecting market conditions.  The SEC’s latest rulemaking proposal – which again, is open to comment – treats exchanges as any system that merely sets up potential buyers and sellers, allowing them to find and negotiate transactions with each other.  In fact, the SEC quite surprisingly fails to properly consider what an exchange does. In order to be an exchange, the law typically requires that an entity conduct functions commonly performed by a stock exchange. But the SEC disagrees, having apparently misapplied the standard statutory interpretation. Worse, the agency does not identify a single function a blockchain protocol performs that is akin to a stock exchange.  If this was not enough, the proposal trips over itself explaining who may be considered part of an exchange. It lists a few “important factors” of indeterminate weight that offer no real notice and only raise more questions as to what all this actually means for anyone participating in the blockchain ecosystem.  In particular, the proposal does not explain the threshold of “significant” token ownership at which blockchain users suddenly obtain sufficient control over the system to assume regulatory responsibilities. Nor does it address the circumstances when a service provider or third-party vendor begins exercising enough control to become responsible – alongside its clients – for a protocol or application.  See also: What Do You Really Own in the Ownership Economy?  In sharp contrast to these ambiguities, the existing law is clear: for a group of persons to be considered an exchange, they must act in concert (i.e. there must be agreement among them). The SEC summarily ignored this requirement. Instead, in order to ensnare decentralized finance (DeFi), the agency waters it down the notion of collective liability to include persons engaged in related activities.  But DeFi fails the actual legal test. Blockchain protocols encompass wide-ranging participants who are not always acting in concert. By their nature open protocols invite people who are invariably independent from each other, both in terms of functions and incentives.  Making matters more complicated, so-called groups who participate in protocols will almost always involve persons based outside the United States. That matters because U.S. securities laws generally do not apply extraterritorially. The SEC even recognizes this circumstance in passing, yet offers no analysis of how its proposal would affect groups that include overseas actors. This is a serious uncertainty that greatly distorts blockchain participation around the world.  Vagueness abounds  Most blockchain-related comments on the 2022 proposal exhaustively covered the multiplicity of ways the SEC was vague – including the fact that in this initial version, the SEC seemed to be writing about blockchain but did not actually name it.  The 2023 draft, other than clarifying that, yes, the rules would apply to blockchain, cures almost none of long-standing problems. Relabeling “communication protocols” as “negotiation protocols” is just pasting a fresh label on the same, contaminated bottle. Chanting “facts and circumstances” like a mantra explains practically nothing.  As the Supreme Court itself has observed, rules are invalid where they rest on “terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at [their] meaning.”  This proposal places the burden squarely on the blockchain space to guess correctly what the rules are. That leaves everyone who guesses wrong – ranging from software companies like ConsenSys to the individual software developers who use our products – potentially facing hefty penalties. In a sense, this allows the SEC to determine whether a rule was broken after the fact – a form of retroactive punishment that due process forbids.  But it gets worse. Under the 2023 proposal, software developers who publish or republish code independently and for free – i.e., a developer who obviously is not establishing an exchange – at best “may be less likely” to face registration obligations if the code is subsequently repurposed for use by a supposed exchange. This is an inspired way to disincentivize the development of free, open-source software.  This attempt at rulemaking effort is essentially a gussied up ban on blockchain in the U.S.  Any good-faith attempt to stay on the right side of these proposed rules would be nothing more than a stab in the dark.  Wait, the old rule already applies?  The 2023 proposal also compounds confusion by making highly contestable pronouncements about the scope of its current regulation – namely, how the current definition of “exchange” in SEC regulations already applies to blockchain protocols.  This conspicuously off-handed pronouncement raises fundamental questions for stakeholders across the crypto industry as to whether they are already regulated, or at risk of future regulation or somewhere in between.  See also: DeFi Unfazed by SEC's Classification of Tokens as Securities  As Hester Peirce, on of five SEC commissioners, aptly put it: the proposal “embrace[s] stagnation, … urge[s] expatriation, and welcome[s] extinction of new technology.”  What benefits? At what cost?  As part of standard practice, the SEC must discuss the benefits and costs of their proposal and how they compare.  It is puzzling, therefore, how little attention this is given. For its part, the SEC confidently declares the main benefit is its expanded regulatory purview – as if that was all the reason one needs. With respect to costs, the proposal meekly offers that they would not be impossible to pay. As to their relative weight, consideration of which is a statutory requirement, the proposal is dead silent.  Any sober analysis from someone with a working knowledge of blockchain would quickly show that the benefits would be illusory and the costs immense.  The proposal appears to greatly underestimate the number of blockchain protocols that would be affected. Further, it does not recognize that these regulatory burdens are magnified for the ordinary individuals who participate in the blockchain ecosystem – such as validators, DAO members and liquidity providers.  First Amendment concerns and rules that chill to the bone  There are constitutional issues with how the SEC's proposed rules would regulates speech. By expressly suggesting that software developers may be liable for their code – including those who develop software for non-business, purely expressive and very often explicitly political reasons – the proposal has a clear chilling effect, given the long-established fact that computer code is speech.  One would like to believe that broadly chilling blockchain innovation is not actually the commission’s goal, because that is clearly not a legally permissible basis for regulating. But that would require ignoring steadily building evidence of bias.  You have the SEC’s about-face on working with the blockchain space on a feasible regulatory framework; the learning sessions that morphed overnight into enforcement investigations; the backflip from “we need congressional action” to figuratively shouting down a discussion draft of new market structure legislation put forward by two House committee chairmen; and most especially, how the SEC leadership – Chair Gary Gensler – gleefully publicizes his hostility towards the blockchain ecosystem (in interviews, op-eds and even Twitter posts).  See also: Gary Gensler's Evolving Position on Crypto – in Quotes  Just recently, for example, the Chair of this famously ""non-partisan"" regulatory agency asserted “we don’t need more digital currency.”  In this context, one cannot help but notice how the 2023 proposal brusquely dismisses commenters’ many concerns. It’s callous indifference to deterring innovation and driving market participants either out of the U.S. or out of business entirely is palpable. In effect (if not also in aim), this attempt at rulemaking effort is essentially a gussied up ban on blockchain in the U.S.  The commission should either withdraw this rule making in full or carve out blockchain explicitly.

While this is not new as miners tend to sell BTC to fund their operations, the sheer volume that is being moved to exchanges is what is alarming. Bitcoin Miners Send Over $70 Million To Exchanges In a recent development reported by on-chain data aggregator Glassnode, Bitcoin miners are moving massive amounts of BTC to exchange. In the last week alone, these miners moved a reported $70.8 million worth of BTC to centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Crypto Investor Sentiment Refuses To Budge, But Can The Weekend Change This? The amount moved in the last week marks the third-largest single inflow for Bitcoin miners in terms of dollar value. It is just 30% below the highest figures which were recorded in 2021 when the price of BTC hit its all-time high of $69,000. BTC miners send over $70m to exchanges | Source: Glassnode Interestingly, because of the current price of Bitcoin, it means that the miners are moving more in terms of the BTC count compared to the dollar count. So miners moved around twice the number of BTC they moved back in 2021 to get the current figure of $70.8 million, data from Glassnode shows. Despite the large selling volumes that seem to be coming from miners, Bitcoin holders continue to be steadfast in their belief in the digital asset. Glassnode reported that long-term holders, i.e. holders who have held their BTC for more than one year, continue to be the most dominant of the bunch with a total of 40.1% of BTC supply remaining unmoved in the last three years. BTC Price Still Shows Bearish Pressure Bitcoin bulls have continued to fight the bears but the effort has fallen short of expectations. As such, BTC prices continue to show intense bearish pressure. BTC falls below $26,000 support | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Despite the digital asset trading above the $26,000 support, it is still sitting below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which could tell of more declines to come. It is also obvious in the fact that bulls are barely holding on to the $26,000 support as resistance mounts at $26,500. Related Reading: Here’s Why Ethereum Could Be At Risk Of Falling To $1,000 Again Nevertheless, the long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency is still very bullish with BTC well above its 200-day moving average.

Meanwhile, BNB prices continue to crash, dropping to register new 2023 lows as when writing on June 12. Binance Changes Terms Of Service News of the exchange quietly changing its terms of service was shared on Twitter. Under these new terms, Binance can, at their volition, swap delisted assets held in a user’s dormant account without consent. Moreover, the exchange can swap the token or coin for any asset they wish. Related Reading: SBI CEO Predicts Massive XRP Price Surge, Expects Ripple Verdict In Few Weeks Observers on Twitter say this update represents an additional tool in the ramp’s arsenal, as it can affect users based on listing and delisting assets, identifying dormant accounts, and the precedents it establishes for other cryptocurrency exchanges. Under the new terms, Binance has exclusive authority to determine which assets are listed, allowing it to list or delist an asset at will. Such a delisted asset can then be converted into a different coin and modified to its order size. Binance can absolve itself and its operatives, of any liabilities or accountability to the asset’s owner, for any fees or losses, or damages incurred in the process. While most of the above interpretation is speculative, as there have been no official announcements or operational evidence of such activities, concerns have been raised about the possibility of Binance absolving itself of any need to be transparent. BNB Crashing After SEC’s Lawsuit The changes come after the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance, which accuses the exchange of allegedly illegally operating an unauthorized exchange in the United States. Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, claims that, from 2019, all US-based citizens were restricted from transacting on Binance Global. Zhao also reiterated that its US-based exchange is an independent entity. However, the SEC claims that the exchange” subverted their controls to secretly allow high-value United States customers to continue trading on the Binance Global platform.” Moreover, while Binance publicly claimed that Binance US is independent, the SEC alleges that Zhao secretly controls the company behind the scenes.

13749188,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537529,1686603626,MATIC Price Displays Recovery But Can Bulls Sustain The $0.50 Support?,"Over the past 24 hours, the Polygon (MATIC) price has shown attempts to reverse its downward movement. The altcoin has regained more than 4% of its value during this time. However, on the weekly chart, MATIC has experienced a decline of over 27%, causing it to breach important support levels. The technical analysis of MATIC indicates a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market, with low levels of demand and accumulation. The volatility of Bitcoin has influenced the price action of altcoins, including MATIC, which have struggled to maintain support levels. Related Reading: Cardano Price Falls Below Key Support Levels, Will It Continue To Fall? A significant return of buying strength is needed for MATIC to surpass immediate resistance. Additionally, the overall strength of the broader market, particularly Bitcoin, will impact MATIC and other altcoins. The decrease in market capitalization for MATIC indicates lower buying activity for the coin. MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, the altcoin price was $0.64. The bulls have managed to defend the support level at $0.60 but sustained low demand could pose challenges for them to maintain it. The immediate resistance level is at $0.67; if surpassed, another resistance may be encountered at $0.73. On the other hand, if the price falls from $0.64, the bears could gain control, causing the altcoin to trade below $0.60. Failure to stay above the $0.60 level in upcoming trading sessions could push MATIC below $0.50. The trading volume for the altcoin in the previous session has declined, indicating stronger selling pressure in the market. Technical Analysis Investor confidence in MATIC has waned since June following its rejection at the $0.76 level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the coin is currently oversold and undervalued, with the RSI falling below both the half-line and the 30-mark. Moreover, the price has dipped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating low demand and the dominance of sellers in driving the price momentum. To see a resurgence in demand, MATIC must trade above the $0.70 price. This level becomes crucial for the coin to attract buyers and potentially reverse the current bearish sentiment. Aligning with the bearish sentiments observed in other technical indicators, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) confirms the negative price direction of an altcoin.

42393332,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOyL9,1686603398,"Bitcoin Dithers Below $26K as Investors Eye CPI Data, FOMC Rate Hike Decision","After surfacing briefly above $26,000 early Monday morning, bitcoin returned to its recent, more familiar haunts below this threshold.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $25,850, down a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC dipped $26,000 near the end of last week, following a troubling mix of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase, and ongoing angst about the U.S. central bank's inflation-fighting monetary policy. Investors will now be eyeing the release of the May Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision a day later.  Read More: Crypto Catalyst Watch: What Might Move Markets This Week  “The Cryptoverse is stuck in limbo as regulatory fears run wild and as some investors abandon certain key exchanges,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email. “Mainstream acceptance for crypto won’t occur with DeFi. While experienced crypto traders move more their trading volumes onto DeFi, this is not good news for long-term growth and for attracting new investors.”  Moya noted that ahead of the CPI report and Fed decision, “bitcoin has key support at the $25,400 region.”  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,735, off 1.8% from Sunday as it was also swept up in a larger market downturn that saw major tokens mentioned in the SEC suits. SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, recently plunged nearly 7%, while MATIC and ADA, the native cryptos of the Polygon and Cardana smart contracts platforms fell about 2.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the CoinDesk Ethereum Trend Indicator ticked into downtrend territory a week after rising into the significant upturn category – the fall-off a sign of sagging investor sentiment.  Cryptos’ path again veered from major U.S. equity indexes, which rose – buoyed by a recent surge in large tech stocks. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to reach its highest level in a year, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury ticked up to 3.73%. Gold, which has often traded similarly to digital assets, fell 0.2%.  In a Telegram message to CoinDesk, Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, noted that the coins caught up in last week's SEC actions are underperforming. Optimistically, though, he reminded that in 2020, Ripple's XRP token lost significant ground before rallying strongly months later.  ""(The) XRP market cap now is roughly where it was just before the SEC sued Ripple,"" Savic wrote. ""We'll see if the assets named in the SEC's lawsuits will show similar resilience amid the regulatory complexity coming from these (Binance, Coinbase) cases.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/12/bitcoin-dithers-below-26k-as-investors-eye-cpi-data-fomc-rate-hike-decision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8719f4b569bc4f91d74324bfcf3f4a785e122715-1700x974.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393326,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOxvV,1686603397,"SEC's Temporary Restraining Order Would 'Effectively End' Binance.US Business, Company Claims","A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Monday effort to freeze Binance US's funds is a ""draconian and unduly burdensome"" move, the U.S. affiliate of the global crypto exchange argued Monday.  ""If the Court does address the merits of the SEC’s motion, it should deny that motion. The SEC seeks unnecessary and unjustified relief. Far from requesting relief that is 'carefully calibrated' to 'maintain[] the status quo' ... the SEC’s proposed remedies would effectively end BAM’s business,"" Binance.US's motion argued.  BAM Trading Services is the name of the entity behind Binance.US. According to the SEC, it is owned by BAM Management US Holdings, which in turn is mostly owned by Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.  The SEC sued Binance, Binance.US and Zhao last Monday on allegations that the companies operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearinghouse all in one to allow U.S. customers to buy and trade certain cryptocurrencies that the regulator claimed were unregistered securities. The SEC also alleged that Binance (the global exchange) and its founder Zhao were able to access Binance.US's customers' funds, moving millions to entities like Merit Peak and Sigma Chain – two companies owned by Zhao.  Read more: SEC Sues Crypto Exchange Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao, Alleging Multiple Securities Violations  The SEC filed for a temporary restraining order to freeze these funds until Binance.US was able to prove that no one at Binance, including majority owner Zhao, could touch them.  Binance and Binance.US had already denied the claims in blog posts and tweets last week, but Monday marked a court-ordered deadline for a formal response. The U.S. District Court for the District of D.C. will hold a hearing on the motion on Tuesday, June 13 at 2:00 p.m. ET.  In Monday's filing, Binance.US's attorneys wrote that freezing its funds would ""primarily harm BAM’s customers, effectively put BAM out of business, and prevent BAM from defending itself in this litigation,"" as it could no longer pay its employees, vendors or other parties or even maintain its technology.  The freeze may also spook Binance.US's banks, one of which has already announced it would cease doing business with the firm, the filing said.  Binance, Binance.US and Zhao have added their legal counsel to the court docket over the past week, including George Canellos, a former Department of Justice prosecutor and one-time SEC Division of Enforcement co-director.  Binance.US proposed an alternative stipulation it urged the judge to sign off on, which calls for the company to repatriate all assets to BAM Trading's ""possession, custody and control,"" affirm that only Binance.US employees have access (which would exclude Zhao) and ensure that no one from the global Binance exchange can access these funds.  Within two weeks, Binance.US would have to transfer all funds to new wallets.  Binance.US's proposed stipulation would stop short of the SEC's sought-after full asset freeze, allowing the company to continue paying employees and vendors but preventing it from paying any other Binance entity.  Securities rules  The Binance.US filing also hinted at the company's opposition to the broader SEC lawsuit, saying the SEC has ""not identified a single security trading on BAM's platform.""  ""The SEC suggests that it is a foregone conclusion that cryptocurrency is a security, but that is not the case. That numerous cryptocurrency exchanges, including BAM, have operated in the United States for years without interference by the SEC belies the claim that they are clearly covered by the securities laws,"" the filing said.  The SEC didn't show that Binance.US sold BNB as an investment contract, the company's filing claimed, despite BNB being the only asset it pointed to on the Binance.US platform as being an unregistered security for the SEC motion's purposes.  It also quoted SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who said there is no regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies before Congress in May 2021, though Binance.US's filing truncated the chair's quote.  ""I do think that working with Congress, and I think it is only Congress that could really address it, it would be good to consider, if you would ask my thoughts, to consider whether to bring greater investor protection to the crypto exchanges,"" Gensler's full quote said. ""And I think if that were the case, because right now the exchanges trading in these crypto assets do not have a regulatory framework either at the SEC, or our sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, that could instill greater confidence. Right now, there is not a market regulator around these crypto exchanges, and, thus, there is really not a protection against fraud or manipulation.""  Monday's filing also echoed Binance and Binance.US's public statements in saying the company had been cooperating with the SEC prior to last week's enforcement action.  ""Until very recently and despite being provided with substantial information about BAM’s custody of assets, the SEC did not express to BAM any of the concerns animating its motion,' the filing said. ""This was unsurprising given that there is no evidence that BAM customer assets have been misused or mishandled. Over the past several weeks, the SEC inexplicably began to focus on the custody of BAM’s assets, and BAM continued to cooperate in good faith, working around the clock to address the SEC’s questions.""  Binance global  In a joint memorandum supporting Binance.US's filing, Binance Holdings and Zhao argued that ""there is no risk to [Binance.US] customer assets,"" and said there was no need for an emergency action.  Like Binance.US, this filing, also published Monday, argued that the SEC had allowed Binance and Binance.US to operate since their respective launches without previously bringing any kind of enforcement action.  ""Why did the SEC let these platforms grow to their current size if it was always illegal?"" the filing asked. ""And how is it that the sudden 'emergency' happens to coincide with the SEC’s assault on the crypto industry as a whole, with Binance and Coinbase being sued on back-to-back days?""  The SEC had not previously raised any concerns about Binance.US's assets or Zhao and Binance's access, the filing claimed, later saying the first time a concern was raised was May 30, 2023 – or in other words, mere days before it sued.  Moreover, the SEC's charges are of registration violations and control person issues, not that funds were misused, the filing claimed.  Binance also disputed SEC allegations that it was a clearing agency or an exchange for the SEC's purposes, saying it ""does not operate Binance.US"" and instead acts as a service provider for the U.S. crypto trading platform.

The token unlock, which will take place on Wednesday, will release almost 196 million tokens, representing nearly 40% of the currently circulating supply, according to data from CoinGecko and Token Unlocks. When this $62 million of tokens are released, owners of BLUR will get greater autonomy over their holdings, gaining the ability to sell or swap.  Releasing that much new supply could push prices down, assuming demand stays constant – as the fundamentals of economics would suggest. But the unlock also comes several days after a wide sell-off this past weekend that drove down the price of tokens the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission labeled as securities. Even though the SEC did not mention BLUR, it dropped more than 20% this past weekend.  About 83% of all BLUR tokens remain locked, according to Token Unlocks.  BLUR’s liquidity stands at roughly $2.39 million in its top five pools on Uniswap V3, the most recent iteration of the largest decentralized exchange by trading volume.

The lawsuits raise questions about which cryptocurrencies should be considered securities, with potential implications for alt-coins and staking programs offered by exchanges. Bitcoin stands to gain from the lawsuit through market share increases, a potential regulatory moat, greater regulatory clarity, and improved sentiment, leading to an upgrade in rating to Strong Buy. Thesis The SEC's lawsuits could cause serious long-term damage to exchanges including Coinbase ( COIN ) and Binance (BNB-USD), as well as many alt-coins including Cardano (ADA-USD), Solana (SOL-USD) and Polygon (MATIC-USD). However, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) can likely emerge from the drama with an improved long-term outlook and wider moat because the SEC has made it clear that it considers Bitcoin a commodity (and thus outside its regulatory scope). The SEC's Argument The SEC sued Coinbase, claiming that Coinbase is operating as a securities broker (e.g., Charles Schwab), exchange (e.g., NYSE), and clearinghouse (e.g., NYSE) but has not registered as any of them. Registration is legally mandated and would enforce requirements such as record keeping and inspection that would allow the SEC to better safeguard investors against potentially illegal/harmful operations. The SEC's lawsuit against Binance is more damning, essentially accusing them of alleged price manipulation, but I won't cover this lawsuit further since the impact is mostly on Binance and is unlikely to change long-term regulatory practices for other cryptocurrency exchanges/tokens. Coinbase's Argument Coinbase argues that the SEC's current guidelines are not complete enough to allow Coinbase to properly register with the SEC. A critical part of their argument is that they only list cryptocurrencies which are commodities rather than securities (commodities and currencies are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission instead of the SEC). The definition of a security was determined by a 1946 Supreme Court ruling , which requires a security to involve all of: An investment of money. In a common enterprise. With the expectation of profit. To be derived from the efforts of others. Coinbase argues that most cryptocurrencies don't meet these requirements because they can function in a transparent and decentralized way. Cryptocurrencies typically allow peer-to-peer transactions, and all transactions are automatically recorded on a public blockchain. In other words, there is no expectation that profits will come from the efforts of others, so the 4th requirement fails. As their name implies, cryptocurrencies are more like currencies than securities. Who's Right? A Thought Experiment There's no doubt that Coinbase's argument is correct for some cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, which even the SEC concedes is a commodity. But imagine a cryptocurrency that copied Bitcoin's technical design, but was created and initially sold by a company selling smartphones, which promised to pay 2% of its profits every year to holders of this cryptocurrency. While Coinbase would still be correct that this cryptocurrency could be bought and sold in a decentralized way with a record of transactions available on a public blockchain, there's clearly an expectation of future profit to be derived from the smartphone company's earnings. Investors should be protected (likely by the SEC) if the company fails to pay out its earnings as promised. In this case, I would argue that this theoretical cryptocurrency should be regulated as a security. In reality, most cryptocurrencies are somewhere between Bitcoin and the theoretical currency described above, which arguably places them in a gray area between securities and commodities. That's what makes this regulatory issue so difficult to solve, and I can't say that I have a perfect solution to offer. Lawyers could - and likely will - argue for days about which cryptocurrencies are securities and whether Coinbase could realistically have registered properly with the SEC under its current guidelines. Neither party is 100% right in my view; I think that some cryptocurrencies are securities, but not all of them. But, I do agree with Coinbase that this issue is complicated enough that is should be handled by an updated regulatory framework which at least mentions cryptocurrency explicitly. Many other countries have done this already with legislation like the EU's MiCA. Hopefully this lawsuit will help to define that framework in the USA, and in doing so clarify when a cryptocurrency is a security. Alt-Coins Under Fire Coinbase offers 212 assets, and the SEC only explicitly called out 13 (6%) of them as securities: Solana, Cardano, Polygon, FileCoin (FIL-USD), Sandbox (SAND-USD), Axie Infinity (AXS-USD), Chiliz (CHZ-USD), Flow (FLOW-USD), Internet Computer (ICP-USD), Near (NEAR-USD), Voyager Token (VGX-USD), Dash (DASH-USD), and Nexo (NEXO-USD). They provided evidence such as these coins' promotion and development by a management team and their use of initial coin offerings to raise funds. I think it will be difficult for the SEC to argue that the current regulatory framework is clear enough that Coinbase could have identified these specific 13 offerings as securities, especially when Coinbase has already made a concerted effort to not list many other crypto assets which it believed may be securities. Further, the SEC's decision to only provide evidence that these 13 assets are securities arguably contradicts its prior claim that all cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin are securities. There are alt-coins like Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) and Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) which are extremely similar to Bitcoin, and I think it will be very difficult to argue that these are securities when Bitcoin is not. So far, the SEC has not provided evidence to support this argument. Notably, the SEC's claim also contradicts statements from fellow regulator CFTC, which has stated that it views Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) as a commodity. When the dust settles, I hope that the more centralized alt-coins (likely including some of the ones flagged by the SEC) will ultimately be classified as securities. But I hope that less centralized alt-coins including Ethereum will be classified as commodities. Centralized assets carry more risk of scams/rug pulls, which many alt-coins have taken advantage of, and in doing so harmed the entire crypto industry's reputation. Centralized regulation of centralized assets helps prevent this, which makes it a good thing that has existed for a long time. Of course, this doesn't mean that all centralized alt-coins have been useless scams. For example, Polygon's layer 2 on Ethereum has made transactions much more scalable, to the point where Ethereum developers were able to de-prioritize planned layer 1 scaling work. Similarly, Flow and its easy walletless onboarding has been critical to the launch and growth of NBA Top Shot and other sports NFT platforms. One unfortunate but necessary side effect of this lawsuit could be that these useful alt-coins end up facing stricter regulations and/or get de-listed from exchanges. On the other hand, they may re-examine their operating models to become less centralized, which would be a good outcome. As described in previous sections, the question of exactly which alt-coins should be considered securities is difficult to solve. Personally, I wouldn't want to hold the alt-coins the SEC flagged until the question of whether they're securities is resolved in courts. As for other alt-coins, many now carry the unfortunate risk that this lawsuit results in centralized regulation of decentralized alt-coins. That makes them higher risk but higher reward, which may be appealing to some investors. Personally, the only alt-coin that I'm comfortable holding while this lawsuit is pending is Ethereum, and even that carries some risk. Coinbase's Staking Mistakes Another caveat in the lawsuit is Coinbase's staking program, in which it stakes users' cryptocurrencies in order to earn a percentage yield on them, and then returns this yield to users after taking a cut of about 25-35%. Staking has been a great way for people to earn a higher return on their crypto investments, and I think it's great that Coinbase has made it easier to stake assets. However, the SEC believes that Coinbase's staking service itself is a security. In this case, I think the SEC actually has a strong argument because Coinbase is performing this service on behalf of users, and users expect to earn a profit. Note that this differs from users staking their assets themselves, in which case they're securing a network and being compensated for their own work. Personally, I fail to see how registering this service as a security would adversely impact the overall crypto space and I think it was a mis-step by Coinbase to not attempt registration of its staking service. One possible reason why they didn't want to register is because they didn't want to lose flexibility, for example, the ability to change their percentage cut at any point and the ability to lose users' staked coins without consequence. If Coinbase's staking program is ruled a security and that ultimately makes the program less lucrative to investors, it could hurt all proof-of-stake coins including Ethereum (but notably excluding Bitcoin). Of course, this would also hurt Coinbase itself. The impact on investors is mixed, since it would make coins harder - but ultimately safer - to stake. Bitcoin: The Biggest Winner It's difficult to find many winners from this lawsuit at this point. As the previous sections highlighted, Coinbase and other exchanges may be forced to remove or update some offerings, including their staking programs. And all cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin are now at risk of being regulated by the SEC as securities, although I do expect some alt-coins to be classified as commodities when the lawsuit is resolved. User and investor sentiment across the industry has also been harmed by the lawsuit. Even the SEC doesn't come off as great here. They look incompetent in light of their inconsistent statements about which cryptocurrencies are securities, poor communication leading up to this lawsuit, and the fact that they failed to act before FTX collapsed. The SEC's communication is so comically poor that they're being represented as trying to kill crypto to protect the US Dollar, when their approach is actually pro-Bitcoin (the crypto that's closest to replacing the US Dollar as the global reserve currency). Even without knowing the outcome of the lawsuit, one clear winner is Bitcoin. The SEC has already stated that they view Bitcoin as a commodity, so even if they win the lawsuit, Bitcoin can still be listed on Coinbase and won't be regulated by the SEC. This would essentially give it a regulatory moat. Meanwhile, a victory for Coinbase would continue business as usual for Bitcoin and the rest of the industry, but with significantly less regulatory concern weighing down the entire industry. Bitcoin also doesn't rely on staking and isn't impacted by the staking part of the lawsuit. A more neutral verdict (which is what I'm hoping for), would be still good for Bitcoin for the aforementioned reasons. It would also be good for alt-coins which are sufficiently decentralized. For balance, some risks to Bitcoin should be noted. First, there's the risk that a prolonged lawsuit harms sentiment in this sentiment-driven industry and drags Bitcoin down with everyone else, at least in the short term. Further, a (very unlikely) bankruptcy of Coinbase caused by the lawsuit could also make it more difficult to buy Bitcoin and increase short-term selling pressure during liquidation. Conclusion Overall, the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase will have a complicated and mixed impact on the overall crypto industry. But it should be good for Bitcoin in the long term. Bitcoin stands to gain from this lawsuit through market share increases, a potential regulatory moat, greater regulatory clarity, and (eventually) improved sentiment. As a result, I'm upgrading my rating for Bitcoin to Strong Buy from Buy.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4611011-why-sec-coinbase-lawsuit-is-great-for-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13748091.jpeg

42393341,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOzAR,1686599540,Blockades and Blockchains: What the Reddit Boycott Has to Do With AI and Crypto,"Reddit is caught between a rock and hard place. With the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) that threatens to disrupt how people find information online and a massive boycott brewing in reaction to a move the legacy social media platform took to bolster itself, the company, which counts an obscene 57 million daily users, is finding out that existence as a “tech darling” doesn’t get any easier even after you successfully “scale.” If anything, Reddit’s current situation only shows the ground it was built on – essentially, advertising and data extraction – was always soft.  If you haven’t heard, there’s a mass protest going on of Reddit – spurred by developers who say they are getting burned by a recent strategic decision by Reddit to start charging for its application programming interfaces (or APIs, essentially the bridges needed to access the site and its data if you want to build something on it). Hundreds of subreddits have taken themselves “private” and several third-party apps are turning their backs on the website, which is looking to go public sometime this year.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Sometimes called the “homepage of the internet,” Reddit is a website that allows people to aggregate news and memes and form communities to discuss…anything. It’s big, too, with some of its semi-autonomous subreddits growing to have tens of millions of engaged users. And so, Reddit has found itself with a trove of valuable data and information – one that replenishes itself on the daily.  For years, Reddit has allowed web browsers to crawl its message boards, a mutually beneficial relationship for itself and services like Google – both of which became dominant platforms by establishing themselves as the places to go if you have a question. The rise of “large language models” (LLMs) by the likes of ChatGPT, which are built and can only improve by ingesting vast quantities of data (i.e. everything available online to be read), have turned this relationship on its head.  In a Q&A on Friday, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman the company was rethinking its stance of giving “its corpus of data” away. It will now charge app developers for access that used to be free, and it appears that a lot of information posted by users over the years will be packaged up and sold (possibly, that last part is semi-informed speculation). There are a few reasons why this is so, stated by Huffman (and, if not, easy enough to intuit).  First, Reddit has always struggled with profitability – a situation that was often encouraged during the age of “blitzscaling,” when private funders would pump companies full of cash so they could grow and grow and eventually, down-the-line earn a return – but is less attractive now in the post-zero interest rate (ZIRP) economy where capital is harder to come by just as Reddit readies to go public. Second, Elon Musk started charging for Twitter’s APIs – and while many complain about his manic leadership, Twitter’s competitors and peers may have noticed the blue bird is still alive. Relatedly, Huffman claims the company somehow spends ""multi-millions of dollars"" per year allowing third-party access to its data.  Third, AI chatbots grown fat on Reddit’s data are coming to eat Reddit’s lunch. While LLM-based chatbots today are most akin to parlor tricks with little engagement beyond superusers and prompt magicians, it seems like the entire tech ecosystem is preparing for a day when ChatGPT and Bard stop hallucinating and disrupt all of today’s existing online services. Why crowdsource a response from Reddit, if there’s a machine that promises the wisdom of the crowd distilled into a personalized response (which can be re-prompted again and again without getting annoyed, or telling you to “check Google"")?  Whether or not today’s protesters care about the company’s attempts to eke out new revenues and defend itself against the Robot Swarm, they’re still mad. And it doesn’t seem like the type of knee jerk anger that has boiled up anytime Reddit updates its layout (which may be surprising given that Reddit has never not looked like Craigslist). In a Reddit post, the boycott organizers said the charges are ""a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit."" Others say the site, which, again, is almost two decades old, is unusable without a third-party access point.  And to be fair, Reddit only developed its own app in 2016, giving a lot of time for users to grow accustomed to alternatives like Reddit Is Fun and Apollo. Not only are these apps now being asked to pay potentially millions of dollars per year for the privilege of bringing users to Reddit, but many of them also contribute unpaid benefits to the site. Many of the site's volunteer moderators, reportedly, use these bespoke apps, for instance.  Now, dear The Node reader, what does all this have to do with crypto? Or how can it help you earn money? Well, depending on how the situation shakes out it could have a few implications for crypto as a social movement. Obviously, the ability for a company to make unilateral decisions that severely affect users is a Big Plus for a movement that is advocating for transparency, open access and user control. Perhaps an enterprising lad, laddess or ladx could build the next Reddit, only decentralized.  However, in a way, the situation might also count against crypto – if the boycott is successful. To the extent that platforms like Ethereum just want to be the substrate of a better web – a situation that requires people to build and maintain alternative applications and for users to migrate over, starting fresh on a new social network, all for the hardly-assured hope things would be better if you give people a share in the platform – then people might find that blockades are better than blockchains for getting what they want. Mass protests are picking up steam in America, and might be weaponized against companies like Facebook and Google to improve things like their privacy standards (if only most people cared). This would certainly be easier than trying to outcompete them in a platform war. And at least you get to keep your username.  Like many of its peers founded during the heady days of Web 2.0 (circa 2005 for Reddit), Reddit once preached the idea that social networks would “democratize” access to information and be a force for good worldwide. Overtime, like other venture capital-fueled companies, the site implemented more restrictive terms-of-use and moderation practices both out of some user’s requests and to protect itself from litigation.  But unlike, say, Facebook, Reddit has arguably stayed closer to its roots – allowing many communities to self-police and retaining a more permissive stance towards what users can post about. In this sense, although its massive corporate-run behemoth that uses the same data-extractive techniques perfected by Zuckerberg, there’s always been an affinity between the world of Reddit and crypto (which is at least part of the reason why Reddit’s embrace of non-fungible tokens found success).  If the crypto world wanted to nudge the wider tech scene towards adopting more of its tenets, it turns out the power was always in its hands. You may not need a carrot of a governance token if you have the stick of a consumer walkout to gain greater say in a platform. By and large, however, I suspect most people do not care about the decisions made by their favorite internet platforms, and are happy to trade away their data for access to a free service. This isn’t to say that crypto is unnecessary, either.  See also: Reddit Avatars Token Minting Climbs to Record High  What the Reddit situation also reveals is the perverse incentives baked into platform capitalism. Except for a handful successful examples, the dream that advertising could pay for web services to remain freely accessable forever was a sham (and that's putting aside the moral concerns of the surveillance that allowed it all to function). Reddit, despite its tens of millions daily users, may never consistently turn a profit.  Crypto offers an alternative in that it requires buy-in from users, and makes the economic costs of online interactions explicit. This system may not fare any better, if it ever truly gets going, but it might be nice to have the option of opting out. This is more than a boycott. It's a quiet revolution, which wants to empower users to pay their own way.

On weekly timeframes, ETHUSD has formed a golden cross, but will it be enough to give the asset class a glimmer of hope amidst such darkness? Let’s take a closer look. Ethereum Price Golden Cross Buy Signal Forms On Weekly Chart Ethereum prices are down roughly 20% off 2023 highs, but still down more than 60% from the record peak back in 2021. Hope for a recovery across the crypto market dwindled last week, when the United States SEC launched enforcement actions against an already weakened industry.

ETHUSD has done so well in the recently bearish environment, in fact, is has formed a golden cross of the 50-week moving average and the 200-week moving average. The golden cross comes almost immediately after a death cross, nullifying a long-term sell signal with a buy signal. When using a two-moving average system, a buy signal occurs when the shorter timeframe crosses the longer timeframe span. This is called a golden cross, while the opposite crossover is called a death cross. A golden cross appears | ETHUSD on TradingView.com Will The Moving Averages Save Crypto From Further Collapse? When using moving averages as a trading signal, in addition to crossovers, price making it above or below the averages is another signal a trend is strengthening. ETHUSD is also well above both the 50- and 200-week MAs. Finally, the slope of the moving averages can be used similarly to a trend line. The 200-week moving average is still pointed in an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the 50-week is just starting to turn direction upward. Related Reading: Rare Crypto Signal Emerges That Could Spark Another 2017-Style Boom The last time the golden cross appeared, Ethereum climbed another 680% before its peak. In contrast, the last time ETHUSD pushed above both moving averages in 2020, Ether rallied by more than 1,700%. Current price action has only brought Ethereum under 5% from the moment it made it above the two averages. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Plus, considering the macro and regulatory pressure on altcoins, another death cross could follow any day now.

According to data from crypto market data provider Kaiko, liquidity, as measured by aggregated market depth for 17 tokens on the exchange, has fallen nearly 80% over the past week. On June 4, the day before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit, market depth was $34 million, but today, market depth is just $7 million. Related Reading: Cardano Price Falls Below Key Support Levels, Will It Continue To Fall? Market Makers Exodus Market makers are financial firms that facilitate trading in financial markets by providing liquidity. They buy and sell assets, such as cryptocurrencies, at quoted prices to profit from the difference between the buy and sell prices, known as the bid-ask spread. In cryptocurrency exchanges, market makers are crucial in providing liquidity by placing buy and sell orders at different price levels. This allows investors to buy and sell assets at a desired price and helps to stabilize the market. However, the decreased market depth has resulted in a more than 6% price difference between mainstream cryptocurrencies on Binance.US and other exchanges, which has since been flattened. The drop in liquidity suggests that market makers are nervous and want to avoid volatility-induced losses and the possibility of their assets getting stuck on an exchange, like during the FTX collapse. Binance.US has suffered the most out of the exchanges targeted in the lawsuits, with its market share dropping from 20% in April to just 4.8% today, according to Kaiko. The drop in market depth for Binance.US indicates that market makers are rushing to exit the market, potentially due to regulatory concerns or other factors. This can have several implications for Binance.US, including decreased liquidity, increased volatility, and potential difficulty for investors to buy or sell assets at a desired price. Coinbase, on the other hand, has seen its market share soar over the past week, from 46% to 64%, for unclear reasons. No particular asset saw an unusual surge in trade volume. However, Coinbase may have the most to lose in the lawsuits, considering 80% of its business is in the United States. In contrast, the Binance.US entity accounts for a small fraction of global Binance activity. Binance Sees $500 Million Drop In Open Interest According to Kaiko research, over the last week, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant decline in open interest, with Bitcoin (BTC) open interest falling over 25% on Binance from peak to trough. From a high of $4.1 billion of open positions, BTC’s open interest on Binance dropped to a low of $2.9 billion as long positions were liquidated and prices fell. Related Reading: Insights On ADA’s Security Concerns: Cardano Founder And Ripple CTO Exchange Views Despite the decline in open interest, funding rates on Binance remained mostly positive throughout the week, only dipping negative for two funding payment periods on the 6th and the 11th.

42393342,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOzFZ,1686596890,"SEC’s Binance, Coinbase Suits Create Uncertain Future for Listed Tokens: Legal Experts","The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against the two largest crypto exchanges by market cap last week will likely have a chilling effect on 19 tokens mentioned in the filings, possibly forcing them to resettle their businesses to other parts of the world, legal experts told CoinDesk.  But the experts warn that the ultimate impact remains uncertain. In the interim, the prices of the native cryptocurrencies from some of the industry’s best-known protocols, have suffered with all but one of them plunging by double digits over the past seven days.  “I’m not sure the lawsuits are a surprise to anyone following the SEC’s current playbook,” Sean Farrell, head of digital asset research at data firm FundStrat, said, adding: “They want to stifle the onramps with costly legal burdens such that everyone moves overseas.”  Last week, the SEC accused Binance and Coinbase of offering unregistered securities to the general public, among other allegations. The suits highlight ongoing questions about whether cryptos are a security, commodity or otherwise. Securities are investments that can be exchanged and used to raise capital.  Early warning  The SEC first warned Coinbase it might sue the exchange earlier this year, sending a Wells Notice, to which Coinbase responded in April. A Wells Notice is a notification that the agency is planning enforcement action against a business. The SEC has been scrutinizing Binance for years.  The suit against Binance addresses the platform’s BNB token and the Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. Crypto analysts have speculated that major U.S. exchanges might have been steering clear of a BNB listing for fear of running afoul of regulators. “Exchanges probably do not list BNB as they see it as a security given the centralization of their network,” said one analyst.  Read More: U.S. SEC Enforcement Could Boost Europe's Crypto Chances, Officials Say  Both lawsuits also stated that a number of other tokens are securities, including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Coti (COTI) and Algorand blockchains (ALGO), Filecoin network (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), Sandbox platform (SAND), Axie infinity (AXS) and Decentraland (MANA), BNB (BNB), Voyager Token (VGX), Chiliz (CHZ), NEAR protocol (NEAR), Flow (FLOW), Dash (DASH, NEXO (NEXO) and Internet Computer (ICP).  “The status of these tokens is now somewhat in limbo,” said Jesse Overall and Steve Gatti, attorneys at the UK-based law firm Clifford Chance. “This creates uncertainty and certain risks in the U.S. for markets and other market participants transacting in the token, as well as potentially the creators, pending a judicial determination,” they added.  Gatti and Chance noted that the SEC has sued the exchanges for listing the tokens, rather than going after token creators.  Overseas  Some analysts think that if the SEC wins, crypto exchanges will have to leave the U.S. market.  “The question is whether this will make its way to court and if so, many in the crypto sector believe a judge will be more objective than the SEC in settling the question of whether crypto currencies are securities,” SEC legal expert Ron Geffner told CoinDesk.  “If the SEC wins, exchanges, issuers and many service providers will have to revisit whether they want to continue to conduct business in the United States and if they do, they will need to determine whether and how best they can comply with the federal securities laws, both in connection with activity previously taken and future transactions.”  Echoing Geffner, Farrell does not expect the tokens to be listed in the U.S. if the SEC wins. Farrell said he hopes that Congress eventually passes “ legislation that will create a safe harbor for teams to launch tokens that can decentralize over a given time period.”  Protocols respond  The Solana Foundation told CoinDesk in a statement that it believes SOL is not a security. “SOL is the native token to the Solana blockchain, a robust, open-source, community-based software project that relies on decentralized user and developer engagement to expand and evolve.”  Similarly, the NEAR Foundation wrote last week in a blogpost that it disagrees with the SEC’s inclusion of the NEAR in the complaint, and said “we believe the Foundation has not violated any applicable US securities laws.”  “The Foundation is regulated in Switzerland and the NEAR token has been characterized as a payment token (and not as a security) under Swiss law,” said the blogpost.  The Cardano development company IOG dismissed the SEC’s contention that ADA, the blockchain's native token, is a security too. “Under no circumstances is ADA a security under U.S. securities laws. It never has been,” IOG said following the lawsuit.  Polygon Labs said MATIC was “developed outside the U.S., deployed outside the U.S.,” and “available to a wide group of persons, but only with actions that did not target the US at any time.”  However, crypto exchange Robinhood announced Friday it will delist ADA, SOL and MATIC on June 27. Other U.S. based exchanges that list these tokens have not yet taken actions.  The Coinbase and Binance lawsuits might propel other exchanges to delist certain tokens to avoid similar charges in the future. According to Joshua Ashley Klayman, U.S. head of fintech and head of blockchain and digital assets at multinational law firm Linklaters LLP, “the SEC complaint against Binance and CZ likely provide a roadmap for the types of charges that other trading platforms and market participants may face in the future.”  Price  All 12 tokens mentioned in the Binance suit have traded down over the past week, Decentraland and The Sandbox have been hardest hit, dropping 26% and 27% respectively.  The tokens listed in the Coinbase lawsuit have also been trading in the red, with Chilliz’s CHZ token plummeting almost 30%.  Farrell said the token price drop might offer a good opportunity for investors to buy. “These suits and their subsequent drawdowns in prices could pull some selling forward and actually create some solid reentry points in the coming days.”  Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at STORM, said that a short-term sell-off was to be expected and he predicts a recovery. “It's worth remembering that many of these tokens are tied to blockchains premium projects; I predict a robust recovery to follow, similar to what has happened with the stock price of Coinbase, which saw a 13% drop before quickly recovering to its previous levels as if to brush off the incident all together.”  Uncharted territory  Clifford Chance's Overall and Gatti said that how creators or users react to the complaints is uncertain. “Will users of the token stop using them in the various apps and protocols for the purposes for which the tokens are designed?,” they said.  “We are in somewhat unchartered territory legally as these assets are not traditional securities and there is little judicial precedent addressing how the federal securities laws apply to secondary transactions in objects that may have initially been offered as part of an investment contract arrangement, or how such objects should be treated pending a judicial determination of the issue,” Overall and Gatti added.",NEGATIVE,BNB | NEAR,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB | NEAR,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/12/secs-binance-coinbase-suits-create-uncertain-future-for-listed-tokens-legal-experts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48b9d41fb73f3bb87ef8bdf94f1b18abcf14274e-4589x2365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
13747041,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/bank-of-china-tokenises-securities-on-ethereum,1686596556,Bank of China Tokenises Securities on Ethereum,"The Bank of China (BOCI) has made history by issuing tokenised securities on the Ethereum blockchain in Hong Kong. This revolutionary development signifies a significant stride forward in the adoption of decentralised finance and highlights Hong Kong's efforts to attract major players in the cryptocurrency industry, including Coinbase. Tokenised Securities: Pioneering a New Era in Finance The Bank of China's decision to issue tokenized securities on the Ethereum blockchain is a bold testament to the institution's acknowledgment of the tremendous potential of blockchain technology. By harnessing the smart contract capabilities of Ethereum, BOCI aims to amplify the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of traditional securities. Tokenisation paves the way for fractional ownership, heightened liquidity, and streamlined settlement processes, ushering in a revolutionary approach to trading, selling, and purchasing assets. Hong Kong's Crypto-Friendly Stance Hong Kong's ambitions to establish itself as a global hub for digital assets and cryptocurrencies have taken a significant leap forward with the Bank of China's introduction of tokenised securities. This milestone aligns seamlessly with the city's concerted efforts to allure leading cryptocurrency exchanges, with Coinbase expressing its interest in expanding its footprint in the region. Hong Kong's proactive approach to embracing digital innovation and its regulatory framework, striking a balance between investor protection and industry growth, positions it as a potential destination for companies operating in the crypto space. Unprecedented Accessibility and Enhanced Liquidity By tokenising securities on the Ethereum blockchain, the Bank of China paves the way for investors, both institutional and retail, to access traditional financial assets with newfound ease and flexibility. Tokenisation empowers fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy and trade smaller portions of high-value assets, thereby rendering previously illiquid investments more accessible. This democratisation of investment opportunities has the potential to revolutionise financial markets, expanding participation and fostering financial inclusion. Advancing Blockchain Adoption The Bank of China's pioneering initiative to issue tokenized securities represents a substantial stride in the adoption of blockchain technology within the conventional financial system. As a prominent financial institution, BOCI's embrace of blockchain validates its transformative potential to reshape the global financial landscape. This progressive move is poised to inspire other institutions to explore the utility of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, propelling further innovation and nurturing a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem.

H.E. Justin Sun, a member of the Huobi Advisory Board, shared his unique insights into the development of the blockchain industry. Becoming a Household Name Huobi and Poloniex witnessed a significant improvement in operational performance during Q2 compared to Q1 2023. This can be attributed to various factors, including the meme coin frenzy and the regulatory crackdown on other exchanges. However, in terms of total on-chain assets, Huobi and Poloniex equated to $4 billion which falls behind Binance's $60 billion and OKX's $10 billion. Huobi stated that in the next six months, it will continue to restore its brand confidence, increase platform assets and trading volume, and achieve profitability targets. It aims to become a stronger player and a household name within the cryptocurrency exchange industry. With months of cost reduction and efficiency improvement efforts, Huobi has overcome survival challenges and will make future decisions based on long-term perspectives. Huobi is committed to actively embracing the ever-changing crypto industry and prioritizing user needs. The company firmly doesn’t believe in sacrificing user interests for short-term gains. The focus will be on constantly creating value for users while achieving greater business wins. Crypto Market's Three Pillars: Exchange, Public Chain, and Stablecoin Sun expressed that Huobi has always been following their global compliance strategy by actively embracing regulation and exploring diverse compliance operations. Numerous crypto companies are entering the Hong Kong market because of its new regulatory rules. Huobi is gaining exposure in the Hong Kong crypto market by launching Huobi Hong Kong, which allowed registration for Hong Kong residents on June 1 2023. Huobi is also the first exchange to become a member of the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Consortium (HKVAC). Additionally, Huobi is in continuous communication with the Hong Kong government to apply for a cryptocurrency exchange license. Sun analyzed that exchanges, public chains, and stablecoins will become the main core of the entire blockchain industry. These three pillars for the decentralized financial landscape will influence long-time development in the industry. Sun stated that their mission is to build a Web3 finance hub in the metaverse and give an option to people worldwide to pursue financial freedom in the metaverse. Public chains serve as the foundation for creating a financial world in the metaverse, while exchanges play a crucial role as the gatekeepers. Sun believes that Huobi holds a leading position within the industry. However, in terms of integration capabilities, Huobi stands out as the sole decentralized financial ecosystem platform with a structure encompassing all three pillars mentioned earlier. The three core businesses consisting of exchanges, public chains, and stablecoins will strive to enhance the user experience from multiple angles. It focuses on long-term industry development, covering the majority of industry traffic, and building a globally influential Web3 financial hub. About Huobi Founded in 2013, Huobi has evolved from a crypto exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, wallets, research, investment, incubation and other areas. Huobi serves millions of users worldwide, with a business presence covering over 160 countries and regions across five continents.

Bitcoin 30-Day Price Range Has Compressed To Tight Values In a new tweet, the analytics firm Glassnode has looked into how volatile the asset has been recently. One way to quantify the volatility of Bitcoin is by taking the highest and lowest price points over a specific time period and calculating their percentage difference. The timespan of interest in the context of the current discussion is the 30-day period, meaning that the volatility here is calculated by checking for the difference between the top and bottom registered during the last 30 days. Naturally, whenever the value of this metric is high, it means that the cryptocurrency’s price has observed large fluctuations in the past month. On the other hand, low values imply that the asset has traded inside a narrow range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Miners Sell At 3rd Largest Scale Ever Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day high and low, as well as the difference between the two (that is, the 30-day range), for Bitcoin over the entire history of the coin: The value of the metric seems to have been quite low in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin 30-day range has had a value of 10.7% recently, meaning that the cryptocurrency’s price has fluctuated 10.7% between its top and bottom during the past month. From the graph, it’s clearly visible that the current value of the indicator is very low when compared to the norm during the asset’s history. Interestingly, this is despite the fact that the BTC price has registered some fresh volatility recently due to FUD around Binance and Coinbase coming under regulatory pressure. While the asset may have seen some short-term volatile price action following the emergence of this uncertainty in the market, Bitcoin has still overall only traded in a narrow range when looking at the grand scheme of things. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Throwback” Could Trigger Flawless Technical Bottom Formation In the chart, the analytics firm has also highlighted the trading days that saw an even tighter 30-day range than the one being observed currently. As expected, it looks like there haven’t been that many instances where such a trend has taken place. Curiously, following most of these occurrences, the Bitcoin price observed a burst of volatility as the narrow 30-day range decompressed. One prominent example of this would be the November 2018 crash, which was preceded by a period of the asset moving endlessly sideways inside a tight range. This crash occurred during the bear market of the previous cycle and lead to the formation of the cyclical bottom for it. If the pattern followed by all these instances is anything to go by, Bitcoin may currently be approaching a narrow range that would only result in some extreme volatility for the asset in the near term.

42393328,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOy5l,1686594432,Crypto Catalyst Watch: What Might Move Markets This Week,"While crypto markets these past few days have mostly reacted to crypto-specific events – mainly the SEC’s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase – economic news may dominate in the coming week.  Here’s the calendar:  Tuesday will see the release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May, with market observers eyeing whether annual headline inflation will slow from April’s 5.5% rate and the core rate from 4.9%. Stubbornly high inflation has forced the U.S. Federal Reserve to continue its now year-plus long string of rate hikes, which has acted as a headwind to crypto markets in general and bitcoin (BTC) in particular.  Perhaps the main event for the week, the results of the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) June meeting will be released at 2 p.m. (ET) on Wednesday. Traders are currently pricing in about a 75% chance the Fed will pause what’s become a historic string of rate increases that started in March 2022, and has seen the benchmark fed funds rate move from a range of 0.00-0.25% to the current 5.0-5.25%. Following the meeting results, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference.  Wednesday will also see the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) for May. Not as closely watched as the CPI, headline PPI slowed to 2.3% in April and the core rate to 3.4%.  On Thursday, initial jobless claims for the week ended June 10 will be released. This number began to creep higher over the past couple of months, and last week went into full gallup, jumping 28,000 to about an 18-month high of 261,000. The action suggests some labor market weakness even as job gains in the monthly nonfarm payroll reports say otherwise.  Also on Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) will announce its latest rate hike decision. The ECB has been on a rate-hike tear since last July as countries also look to tame high inflation.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/12/crypto-catalyst-watch-what-might-move-markets-this-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e140eba85e1266a050930a7ef5582d2306bc854-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The protocol said Polygon 2.0 is its vision for building “the value layer of the internet,” enabling decentralized finance, digital ownership, new means for coordination and more.  As part of that, Polygon 2.0 will be a network of zero-knowledge (ZK) layer 2 chains that will be able to communicate amongst themselves. The blog post also shared that on the user end, the network will feel like a single blockchain.  Currently, the Polygon zkEVM Beta, which was released to the public in March, is the only chain from Polygon that incorporates ZK technology, a type of scaling solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale blockchains and reduce transaction fees.  Polygon's main chain, the Polygon PoS chain, currently is not ZK-compatible, though Polygon previously told CoinDesk in an interview that it was exploring the possibility of using ZK technology in its main chain.  The announcement for how Polygon plans to address its Polygon PoS chain is set for next week. Following that, Polygon will make a series of announcements over the next four weeks on the blockchain's architecture, its token and governance.

13745558,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4610979-uniswap-beneficiary-of-sec-crypto-war?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1686591772,Uniswap: Beneficiary Of The SEC's Crypto War?,"Summary The SEC is coming after centralized exchanges Coinbase and Binance. This could be a tailwind for decentralized exchanges, or DEXes. Uniswap is the market-leading DEX and has a platform governance token. Governance aside, I don't see much reason to hold UNI until the ""fee switch"" is turned on and a portion of swap fees are paid to token holders. With the backdrop of the recent SEC lawsuits against popular cryptocurrency exchanges Binance (BNB-USD) and Coinbase ( COIN ), the idea of decentralized exchanges possibly generating more user interest have entered the zeitgeist once again. Decentralized exchanges, or DEXes, function like centralized exchanges (CEXes) but without the permissioned access models that are typically associated with third-party platforms that practice KYC/AML policies. 2023 Crypto Trading Volume When FTX (FTT-USD) collapsed in November of last year, it theoretically opened the door for the DEX model to start taking trading volume share from the centralized exchanges. Over the last twelve months, there is no question that aggregate trading volume has declined both for centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Monthly Trading Volume. *through June 11th (Dune, The Block) However, the share of that volume going to DEXes has increased from an average of about 7% in the second half of 2022 to over 10% in the first half of 2023. It could certainly be claimed the collapse of a centralized business like FTX helped drive a larger share of crypto activity on-chain through DEXes in 2023. Given that, it could also be argued the SEC's war against centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase could also be a positive catalyst for DEX activity share growth long term. ETH Exchange Balance (Glassnode) While it's way too early to tell if DEXes will continue to take more share of crypto trading volume from CEXes like Binance or Coinbase, the exchange flow of those coins might offer a convincing tell. According to data from Glassnode, the Ethereum (ETH-USD) balance on exchanges just hit a 5-year low. Uniswap Usage Uniswap Volume by Chain (DeFiLlama) As a largely Ethereum-based protocol, Uniswap (UNI-USD) is in a great position to benefit from wider adoption of decentralized exchanges if ETH continues to come out of CEX wallet addresses. DEX Volume by Protocol (Dune Analytics/hagaetc) Maybe more importantly though, in the world of DEX usage, Uniswap is the clear market leader as the protocol generally commands anywhere between 50-60% of all DEX swap volume. However, there is an important factor for this commanding market share; unlike competitors like SushiSwap (SUSHI-USD), Uniswap's token holders don't take a cut of fees from platform swaps. This allows Uniswap to charge less in fees as a percentage of total swap volume: May 2023 Volume Fees Fee % of Vol SushiSwap $1,600 $4.7 0.29% Uniswap $33,800 $59.2 0.18% Source: Token Terminal, dollars in millions This model has likely had a positive impact on the popularity of Uniswap as a platform from the end user's perspective. That platform popularity is partially what has driven Uniswap's token to a $2.4 billion market capitalization and a top 25 crypto market cap ranking. Despite no revenue generation from fees to token holders, UNI remains one of the most widely held tokens in all of crypto with nearly 350k token holders. UNI's Tokenomic Problem I've covered Uniswap for Seeking Alpha in the past. In my view, the tokenomic model isn't terrific. There is no in-platform utility like reduced fees for token holders when doing swaps. As mentioned in the section above, UNI token holders don't currently take any cut of platform revenue from those swaps, either. Aside from hoping the coin's price goes higher, the only real reason to justify holding UNI is that token holders can participate in governance decisions. Despite that ability, UNI's voter participation is somewhat weak in my view: Treasury Rank Treasury Organization Token Holders Lifetime Participants % of holders 1 $3.5b Arbitrum One 584,000 130,200 22.3% 2 $3.3b BitDAO 26,300 8,300 31.6% 3 $2.6b Optimism Collective 662,400 88,700 13.4% 4 $1.7b Uniswap 347,300 28,200 8.1% 5 $841m Gnosis 21,100 5,500 26.1% Sources: DeepDAO, Token Terminal According to DeepDAO, lifetime participants of Uniswap governance is much lower than that of recently airdropped governance tokens for Arbitrum (ARB-USD) and Optimism (OP-USD). Beyond that, the number of holders who have participated in governance voting is just 8% - which is low compared to other DAOs with large treasuries. My fundamental opinion on UNI changed from bullish to neutral in December 2022 when it appeared as though the actual ability for UNI holders to participate in meaningful platform governance decisions was questionable. From my December article: At present, governance is the only fundamental reason to have exposure to UNI. And this type of data collection was never voted on by the token holders. Until token holders are rewarded with platform fee distributions or given some sort of in-app benefit for holding, ""governance"" over the platform may no longer be a valid reason to hold the token in my view. What could possibly change my view on UNI is if the much talked about ""fee switch"" is ultimately turned on. This switch was recently brought to a vote for UNI token holders. This switch would enable a small portion of fees to be paid to UNI token holders. But despite more than 50% of the UNI votes being in favor of the switch, the measure actually failed to pass because of what some have called a structural flaw in the proposal that asked voters to determine the size of the fees in addition to whether or not the fees should be dispersed at all. The criticism from the community seems to be that the vote should have been focused on just enabling fees. Summary As I see it, the current problem for Uniswap holders is that governance may not be a strong enough reason to hold the token. This could be alleviated if the ""fee switch"" is turned on and holders earn a share of revenue from the protocol. Despite the failure of the recent fee switch vote, it does appear as though there is an appetite for turning the fee switch on. However, if the fee switch is turned on, it presents another potential problem as US regulators may view UNI as an unregistered security if token holders are able to generate a passive yield simply from holding the token. Furthermore, the fee switch may be a disincentive for Uniswap's liquidity providers, as the fees would come from the rewards that are paid out to the platform LPs. This could theoretically lead to less liquidity in the Uniswap protocol and by extension less usage of the platform. However, all of that is purely speculation on my part. The bottom line is Uniswap is one of the top protocols in all of crypto and commands a top 25 coin market cap. While I certainly wouldn't call UNI a sell based on the prospect that it could one day payout fees to token holders, I think it's still a hold at this point.",NEUTRAL,UNI,EXCHANGE | ICO | REGULATION | TRADING | UNI,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4610979-uniswap-beneficiary-of-sec-crypto-war?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13745558.jpeg

As is well-known, Kitao is one of Ripple’s biggest supporters and, remarkably, a former board member of the fintech (replaced by Adam Traidman). In a Japanese speech in front of an audience, Kitao made several statements that are likely to make the XRP community sit up and take notice. According to Kitao, the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of XRP as an unregistered security could come to an end as early as the next few weeks. Ripple About To Go Public? In addition, the SBI Holdings CEO stated that he expects XRP prices to rise sharply if the court rules in Ripple’s favor. He sees this as an event that could increase not only the price of XRP, but also its overall acceptance in the digital finance world, saying (translated from Japanese): If the conclusion is reached and XRP is a coin, I think it will be a very expensive price. Even more surprising to the XRP community, however, may be Kitao’s statement that he expects Ripple Labs to go public (IPO) as soon as the ruling is handed down by Judge Analisa Torres of the United States Southern District Court of New York. Kitao said: If the conclusion [of the trial] is positive, I think the management will immediately go public. Such a move, according to Kitao, could lead to significant financial benefits for Ripple stakeholders such as SBI Holdings, regardless of whether they decide to sell their XRP holdings or keep them. Related Reading: Former SEC Chairman Deserves Appreciation From Ripple, Alderoty States While the speculation of a Ripple IPO may come as a surprise to many, the rumors are not new. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said himself during an interview at the World Economic Summit 2020 on the subject of an IPO: “We won’t be the first, and we won’t be the last”. At the time, the Californian fintech was not yet in litigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Remarkably, back in April 2021, during a presentation of SBI’s quarterly results, Kitao claimed that the SEC’s lawsuit was the last hurdle for Ripple before an IPO. XRP Price Ahead Of A Breakout Due To Hinman Docs? Already tomorrow, Tuesday June 13th, the XRP price could experience a major upswing. According to former federal prosecutor James K. Filan, the unsealing of internal SEC Hinman documents in the Ripple case could occur. The Hinman documents may shed light on Ethereum’s (ETH) previous classification as a non-security and mark a massive partial victory for Ripple.

Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) began accepting applications for crypto trading platform licenses on June 1. Crypto firms which get registered under this license will be able to serve retail customers in the country and will need to comply with rules that prohibit crypto incentives like airdrops.  “I hereby offer an invitation to welcome all global virtual asset trading operators including @coinbase to come to HK for application of official trading platforms and further development plans,” Hong Kong legislative council member Johnny Ng said in a tweet on Saturday.  “Coinbase is dedicated to partnering with high-bar regulators across U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions,” a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk, responding to the tweet.  Ng’s invite comes amid a U.S. crackdown on crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which have both been sued recently by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly violating federal securities laws.  Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, said in April that his company would consider moving out of the U.S. if there continues to be no regulatory clarity around how crypto is treated, something which the company has been pushing for.  Coinbase is now looking to expand globally, Tom Duff-Gordon, Vice President of International Policy at Coinbase, said in an interview.  “Coinbase is really excited to be expanding overseas,” Duff-Gordon said.  The company is trying to build in Abu Dhabi, Canada and is waiting for a full license in Singapore, where it already has in-principle approval, Duff-Gordon added.  While the company has been operating in the U.K. through CB Payments Limited, which has been authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority as an electronic money institution, the company hopes to apply for authorization under the U.K.’s new crypto regime once that is finalized, Duff-Gordon said.  While international expansion is a key focus, Coinbase is not ready to give up on the U.S., according to Duff-Gordon.  “The easiest thing for us to do would be to cut and run but that's not what we're doing,” Duff-Gordon said. “We want to represent the industry to stand up and to fight for regulatory clarity in the U.S.”  UPDATE (June 13, 8:47 UTC): Adds Coinbase has approval in principle in Singapore in ninth paragraph.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/12/hong-kong-lawmaker-invites-coinbase-to-apply-to-operate-in-region-amid-us-sec-crackdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37e7f254135b2230959b5659d83c8754f79547b0-4905x2759.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393329,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOyG1,1686587623,10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better (or Maybe Worse),"Poor crypto. Once the darling of the tech world, crypto -- or blockchain or Web3 or whatever we’re calling it today -- has been mired in lawsuits by the SEC; a frosty bear market; and now, perhaps most painfully, the indignity of playing second fiddle to AI.  Jeremiah Owyang, an influential entrepreneur who has been active in the Web3 space, lives in San Francisco and told me there are three to five AI events per day in his community, but there are “very very few Web3 events now.” (Owyang is now diving deep into AI.)  Jeff Wilser, a CoinDesk feature writer, is the author of 7 books including Alexander Hamilton's Guide to Life, The Book of Joe: The Life, Wit, and (Sometimes Accidental) Wisdom of Joe Biden, and an Amazon Best Book of the Month in both Non-Fiction and Humor.  Sheraz Ahmed, Managing Partner at Storm (a blockchain consultancy), said that when he traveled to Dubai for a crypto event, “it was a bit shocking that in every blockchain keynote panel, AI was included. It was a blockchain conference, but only AI was being spoken.”  And there’s no question that the sloshy start-up capital is now enamored by AI. As Meltem Demirors, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares, joked on Twitter, “2019: we are a crypto fund. 2020: we are a DeFi fund. 2021: we are a blockchain gaming fund. 2022: we are a web3 fund. 2023: we are an AI fund.”  But maybe pitting Crypto vs. AI is the wrong framework? Web3 might be in “winter,” but it’s not dying. Projects continue to quietly build. And, if it’s true that AI will impact every industry, clearly that will include Web3. As CoinDesk’s Michael Casey recently wrote, “AI will need Web3, and vice versa. Why not build both?”  Projects like SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, and Cortex have already been working on various types of decentralized AI solutions. Many more will inevitably follow. “I feel like there’s a lot training that you get from the crypto space that’s weirdly useful if you’re starting to think and engage about AI,” says Nathaniel Whittemore, who now hosts a daily AI podcast in addition to his daily Web3 podcast. By “training” he means getting accustomed to things like regulatory issues, educating others on a weird new tech, and how “you get used to being hated by some portion of the population.”  Read more: Michael Casey - Why Web3 and the AI-Internet Belong Together  As for how AI and crypto will interact and intersect? “There’s a whole slew of possibilities,” says Whittemore. Some are obvious, some are outlandish, some are hopeful, and some are nightmarish. To impose a bit of order to the chaos, we’ll consider ten possible areas of overlap…which range from boosts in productivity to Armageddon.  1. AI will make Web3 projects more productive and efficient.  This is less about the unique properties of crypto and more about how AI will change everything, Web3 included. “I think AI will impact [Web3] in all the normal ways it does for other industries,” says Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner of Dragonfly. “Productivity will increase dramatically. Smaller startups will be able to do more.” He expects that Web3 projects will need to spend less on things like marketing, copywriting and other elements of operations.  Whittemore agrees. “AI will almost certainly radically increase the number of people who are capable of building blockchain and Web3 applications,” says Whittemore. And there could be a knock-on effect. He thinks that because it will become easier for non-tech people to learn things like how to code, that could potentially help “reduce the power gap” that’s ingrained in the community.  2. Blockchain could bring decentralized values, governance, and guardrails to AI.  This is the chocolate-meets-peanut-butter solution that many in the space have craved. “Blockchain platforms can support the creation of decentralized AI models,” says Ahmed, who adds that this solution would -- in theory -- keep data private, reduce biases in the models, and curb the growth of centralized monopolies.  There’s a lot training that from the crypto space that’s weirdly useful if you’re starting to think about AI  “In theory,” of course, is the rub. There are skeptics. “[AI] is not a technology that lends itself to distributed systems,” says Qureshi, because they’re being built by small groups of experts and require a staggering amount of computing power. “They’re not the kind of thing where you can leverage a lot of decentralized resources, like you can with bitcoin mining.” (Many in the Web3 space, of course, disagree and are trying.)  Whittemore admits that he’s “enormously skeptical” every time he sees a new crypto/AI project, but adds that “there are a lot of really smart people thinking about exactly this,” and he imagines we’ll see more “interesting overlaps” in the second half of this year. He’s also encouraged that “open-source approaches [to AI] are outperforming everyone’s expectations,” which gives a jolt of optimism for a decentralized approach.  3. AI will upend crypto trading.  Crypto trading is 24/7, without borders, and it happens across a dizzying range of assets and markets. Even in the pre-AI status quo, humans struggle to keep pace with the always-on casino. That will get harder. Quant and algorithm-fueled trading “bots” have existed for years, of course, but they’ll get exponentially better. This could be lucrative for those who use them, death for those who don’t. The millions of “retail traders” could get squeezed. “AI is going to be the enemy of the stubborn-minded,” says Ahmed. “If a trader does not want to use [AI] and wants to do everything manually, they’re going to get left behind.”  4. Blockchain could save us from AI’s ocean of misinformation.  AI-injected deep fakes have already gone viral and tricked millions, and if the trend continues -- which it almost certainly will -- we could soon be living in a dystopian world that some have called a “post-truth society.” Reality will be up for grabs.  Crypto advocates have long argued that blockchain could be used to authenticate that digital assets -- like photos and videos -- are what they claim to be. “Zero-knowledge proofs do not get enough attention, but they will be extremely important for AI going forward,” says Joseph Raczynski, a technologist and futurist. “They will serve as the technology that helps prove something is something, without divulging anything sensitive.”  5. AI could make crypto compliance and auditing easier.  “Especially after the events of the last year, regulators are becoming more hands-on and demanding more compliance,” says Elbruz Yılmaz, Senior Vice President of Web3 and Crypto at Paysafe, a payments provider. Auditing is a manual and time-consuming process, says Yılmaz, and many Web3 companies aren’t set up to do it. They’re playing catch-up. “AI will help these companies get to a competitive level in compliance faster,” says Yılmaz.  Read more: Paul Brody - When AI and Blockchain Merge, Expect the Mundane at First  6. AI could make life easier (or harder?) for crypto hackers and scammers.  The large language models of AI make it “easier to attack smart contracts,” says Qureshi. In the same breath, he adds that perhaps AI could also make smart contracts “easier to defend.” He doesn’t yet know which way that will tip -- no one does. The only thing we can say with confidence is that AI will be weaponized by the bad guys and used as a shield by defenders; who wins is an open question.  Then there are the scammers. “Crypto scams are far more sophisticated with an AI involved,” says Pete Howson, a technology researcher and crypto skeptic, who’s also the author of the upcoming book “Let Them Eat Crypto.” “For example, ‘deep fake’ videos of celebrity endorsements are encouraging suckers to invest in the next big shitcoins.” This is not just speculation. It’s already happening. Howson continues: “In November 2022, a verified Twitter account posing as Sam Bankman-Fried posted a deepfake video offering FTX users ‘compensation for their loss’ in a phishing scam designed to drain their crypto wallets. Fraudsters are using AI platforms to build fake trading websites.”  7. AI could spur the growth of the metaverse.  With all due respect to Apple’s Vision Pro, the infrastructure for the metaverse is still a glitchy work-in-process. The space needs a better user interface. Better graphics. Better content. Better community. AI could help with all of that. AI will slash the time it takes to build immersive worlds, and it could even populate these worlds with human-seeming characters. Nvidia recently melted faces in the game developer community, for example, by showing how AI could power real-time dialogue with NPCs (non-player characters), which unlocks all kinds of potential for world-building. “AI can help these games become much more engaging, faster,” says Yilmaz.  Crypto scams are far more sophisticated with an AI involved  8. AI could exacerbate the environmental concerns of crypto.  Okay, perhaps this one isn’t about making anything “better,” but we should acknowledge the concerns and risks of environmental impact. “Just like cryptocurrencies, generative AI platforms also use criminally huge amounts of energy,” says Howson. “The training of ChatGPT consumed 1,287 MW of electricity per hour, producing 550 tonnes of carbon dioxide. That’s equal to a person taking 550 roundtrips between New York and San Francisco.”  9. Cryptocurrency could be used by AI agents.  This is my favorite.  Qureshi imagines that in the future, as bots like ChatGPT get more advanced, they will essentially function as your personal assistant, or agents. They could book you flights, place your Instacart order, or summon your Uber at exactly the right moment. (Three years ago I interviewed a Web3 entrepreneur, Dele Atanda, who described exactly this scenario.)  Sure, some of this might fit in the current financial framework, but what about when my AI agent begins transacting with your AI agent? Or, what if the way AI agents spend money simply becomes too complicated for the laws or banks to catch up?  “They will need money,” says Qureshi, “And the idea that JP Morgan Chase is going to open a bank account for AI is nonsense.” Qureshi suspects that the “laws are not going to catch up in time,” but that crypto is already a functional solution that can be implemented immediately.  Whittemore says something similar. He gives a hypothetical: Imagine that you want to start an online store for band logo keychains, and the AutoGPT (or your AI “agent”) devises a set of tasks, and one of them might be to figure out how it’s going to 3D print the keychains. “Can it just send bitcoin to the 3D printing [AI] agent that runs autonomously in the background?” If the 3D printing agent is located across the globe -- which is often the case -- then bitcoin would be a more elegant solution than dollars.  Read more: Allison Duettmann - How Crypto Can Help Secure AI  So, in the end, after years of searching for “adoption,” the first mass-market use of cryptocurrency-for-transactions might come not from humans, but machines.  10. AI could leverage crypto to achieve the Nightmare Scenario.  We’ll zag with one more less optimistic possibility. (And “less optimistic” is putting it lightly.)  If you’ve been at all AI-curious, by now you’ve probably heard the cheerful stat that in a survey of AI researchers, more than half thought there was at least a 10% chance that AI could wipe out the human species. (Sidenote: This stat is slightly exaggerated and has been somewhat misreported, as the survey response rate was only 4% and not truly a representative sample of scientists. But still. Whether it’s a 1% chance or 10% chance, the “nightmare scenario” is still very much a scenario.)  And crypto could play a role in that nightmare.  “With greater dependence and importance on digital assets, an AI agent could alter a financial institution with ease, impact a governing body, or take down a government without anyone even knowing, until it is a bit too late,” says the futurist Raczynski, who also imagines that the AI could wreak havoc in a metaverse. Raczynski fears that the advancement in AI will allow it to soon surpass the abilities of humans, “and blockchain is an enabler.”  Final thoughts  So let’s conclude on something a bit less Armageddon-ey. Even though AI is now getting all the hype and the shine from VCs, the experts I spoke with were not concerned about the funding impact to Web3. “This is a silly thing to worry about,” says Qureshi, who acknowledges that an insane amount of money is pouring into AI “with sky-high valuations,” but doesn’t expect this to materially hurt the Web3 ecosystem. “There’s a lot of capital in the U.S.,” says Qureshi, who adds that no one can say with straight-face, “We don’t have enough money,” and that “I haven’t heard that in the last three years.”  And on a more hopeful note, ultimately, Ahmed thinks that AI and crypto needn’t be in competition, but are rather just “tools in a toolbox.” They’re complimentary. “They’re not fighting amongst each other,” says Ahmed. “Ultimately they’re going to be connected, just like electricity is used to power the internet.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/12/10-ways-crypto-and-ai-can-make-each-other-better-or-maybe-worse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b694fa96b9461823c45ae8ff1612fc2ac3592659-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13744178,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537506,1686587409,Data Reveals Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Refuse To Sell Despite SEC Crackdown,"Amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny and fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding Bitcoin (BTC), short-term holders who are often known to be the first to sell off their assets when prices decline have displayed unusual resilience in the face of the current market challenges. According to the latest data, these holders are bucking the trend and choosing to stay in the market, indicating their confidence in Bitcoin’s future profitability. Short-Term Holders Display Resilience Amid Regulatory Challenges According to an analysis from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s lackluster price performance within the $25,000-$30,000 range has not dampened the enthusiasm of short-term holders. The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric reveals their interest in remaining in the market and seeking profitability. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Miners Sell At 3rd Largest Scale Ever The persistence of this metric over consecutive months, coupled with short-term holders’ pocket value surpassing a specific threshold, indicates their commitment to staying invested. CryptoQuant further reveals this pattern mirrors previous price cycles, such as those witnessed in 2015 and 2019, where short-term holders maintained their positions and reaped long-term rewards. Notably, the current cycle’s profitability for both long-term and short-term holders has not yet reached levels that trigger significant selling pressure. This trend suggests that Bitcoin still has room for growth and the potential for another wave of demand. Despite ongoing regulatory challenges and negative market sentiment, short-term holders remain undeterred, holding on to their Bitcoin investments with optimism. Moreover, Glassnode data has further supported the resilience of short-term holders, revealing a recent uptick in hodling activity. According to the data, after a period of active selling in the previous month, short-term holders have shown a renewed commitment to retaining their Bitcoin holdings. This shift in sentiment indicates their belief in the future potential of Bitcoin, even in the face of regulatory uncertainties. Long-Term Holders Maintain Confidence In Bitcoin Meanwhile, long-term Bitcoin holders have also demonstrated confidence in the cryptocurrency, in addition to short-term holders being unfazed. These holders have shown minimal movement of their tokens to centralized exchanges, highlighting their commitment to holding their Bitcoin assets for the long term. By maintaining their positions and avoiding panic selling, long-term holders contribute to the overall stability of the market and reinforce the positive outlook for Bitcoin. Regardless, over the past week, Bitcoin has faced a significant price plunge, causing its market value to dip below $26,000, marking a decrease of 2.9%. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Trend Shifts Alongside Stablecoin Flows: Glassnode This downward trend can be attributed to the prevailing negative sentiment in the crypto market, which has been further intensified by the recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, two of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. However, despite this decline, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has shown a slight uptick of 0.2% in the last 24 hours. In contrast, BTC is trading at $25,826, reflecting a notable drop in value compared to its price of above $27,000 just a week ago.

42393327,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOy0d,1686585104,BitGo's Suit Against Galaxy Digital Over Canceled $1.2B Purchase Dismissed by Delaware Judge,"A federal judge has sided with Galaxy Digital (GLXY.TO) – the crypto merchant bank led by Mike Novogratz – in its decision to terminate its $1.2 billion acquisition of crypto custodian BitGo.  Delaware Chancery Court Vice Cchancellor James Laster ruled last week that Galaxy had a “valid basis” to end the deal because BitGo provided Galaxy with ""non-compliant"" documents pertaining to its financial health.  ""There are no facts alleged that could make it reasonably conceivable that the exercise of the termination right was inconsistent with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,"" Judge Laster said in the ruling.  ""BitGo plans to appeal the Court’s decision, and continues to believe that Galaxy wrongfully terminated the agreement,"" said BitGo in response to the judge's decision.  The two initially agreed to a deal in May 2021, with Galaxy looking to become a one-stop shop for prime brokerage services geared toward institutional investors. With the crypto bear market in full swing, Galaxy ultimately called off the merger in August 2022, citing Bitgo’s withholding of audited financial statements.  BitGo subsequently sued for $100 million in damages, calling Galaxy’s reasoning “absurd,” and suggesting Galaxy pulled out because it could no longer afford the purchase after racking up hundreds of millions in losses during the bear market.

Hoskinson and Schwartz’s objections to the SEC’s stance were prompted by tweets from an attorney known for supporting XRP, Bill Morgan. It’s important to note that the US SEC filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase on June 6 and June 5, alleging that both exchanges were trading unregistered securities. Product Improvements Doesn’t Make it A Security, Said Bill Morgan In recent tweets, Bill Morgan expressed his skepticism about the SEC’s argument. He raised concerns about the validity of the SEC’s claim, emphasizing that it overlooks the transformative nature of technological progress and innovation within the cryptocurrency industry. Related Reading: Pepecoin Price Drops, Breaking Key Support Level – Further Downfall Ahead? He compared the situation to how smartphones have evolved, with manufacturers constantly improving and adding new features to make them better. Referring to a section of the SEC’s complaint, he highlighted that the agency’s argument is based on the notion that ADA is a security due to IOHK’s efforts to enhance the Cardano blockchain and released blogs. Meanwhile, Bill stressed that updating the community about product improvements does not make that product a security. He added that this principle should apply to the continuous progress made within the Cardano Blockchain. Furthermore, the SEC’s accusations mainly focus on trading ADA on Coinbase after it was listed in March 2021, rather than the initial coin offering (ICO) that occurred four years earlier, Morgan added. Cardano Founder And Ripple CTO Respond To Recent Developments Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz have weighed in on Morgan’s arguments, providing insight into the recent events. Hoskinson shed light on the ADA’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) situation, providing much-need clarification to crypto enthusiasts. He highlighted that the ADA’s ICO took place in Japan and did not entail the direct selling of ADA tokens but instead utilizing vouchers, targeted marketing, and pricing in Yen and Bitcoin. Notably, Americans did not participate in the ICO, and Charles confirmed that the only purchase made by US citizens were exclusively related to secondary sales that occurred four years after the ICO. However, this means that Americans acquired ADA solely through the secondary market and were not directly involved or connected to the original ICO in Japan. In response to Hoskinson, Morgan added that based on the SEC’s location and nature of the operation, its power does not cover the ICO. He emphasized that, despite this reality, the agency claims that ADA “became” security solely because it became available on US-based exchanges. Morgan criticized the illogical nature of this argument. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, also entered the conversation, drawing attention to the SEC’s perspective on ICO transactions and subsequent sales. According to Schwartz; I guess their argument must be the ICO was a securities offering, just not an SEC issue because of no US nexus. But then I thought it was their position that secondary sales were exempt. The ICO transactions didn’t take place on exchanges. So what’s the investment contract?

The day before the lawsuit, June 4, market depth was at $34 million, whereas on Monday, market depth was at $7 million, according to the report.  The SEC sued Binance, the operating company for Binance.US and founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao. Binance global also witnessed a drop in market depth, dropping 7% since the start of June.  “Binance's market depth initially held steady, even increasing in the immediate aftermath of the lawsuit, but over the weekend fell as altcoin markets sold off,” said the Kaiko report.  Binance isn’t the only exchange suffering from a drop in market depth. U.S.-based Coinbase, which was also sued by the SEC last week, saw its liquidity drop by 16% over the same time period.  “The sharp drop in liquidity suggests market makers are nervous and want to avoid volatility-induced losses and the non-negligible possibility that their assets could get stuck on an exchange à la FTX collapse,” said the Kaiko report.  The report noted that although Binance.US’s market share dropped to 4.8% in June, Coinbase’s market share increased over the past week from 46% to 64%, for reasons that are unclear, said Kaiko.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/12/binanceus-market-depth-declines-76-in-june-following-sec-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0657b7553b430676648b8eca73339d70da519fe-1100x587.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Every Bored Pepe is distinctive and algorithmically created from a pool of over 70 potential traits, such as expression, headwear, clothing, and more.

42393337,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOypv,1686582405,21Shares Introduces Exchange-Traded Product for Liquid Staking Platform Lido DAO,"21Shares, a provider of crypto exchange-traded products (ETP), introduced a way of gaining exposure to Lido DAO, offering traditional investors single asset exposure to the largest participant in the liquid-staking ecosystem.  According to the Switzerland-based company’s issue-specific summary, “21Shares Lido DAO ETP (LIDO) is a non-interest bearing, open-ended security. Each series of the product is linked to an index or specific underlying asset Lido DAO.”  The products are offered to the general public in 22 European Union countries including France, Germany and Portugal and traded on several exchanges like SIX Swiss Exchange, BX Exchange and the Stuttgart Exchange. The ETP currently has $100,000 in assets under management (AUM), compared with 21Shares’ more than $1.1 billion total AUM.  21Shares has marked this product as “high risk” in several categories: market risk due to lack of capital protection, regulatory risk, secondary market risk, risk of the occurrence of an extraordinary event and the risk of a quick change in the value of a crypto asset that could drop to zero.  “We have classified this product as class 7 out of 7, which is the highest risk class,” 21Shares said in a document with the product’s key information. “This rates the potential losses from future performance at a very high level, and poor market conditions are very likely to impact the capacity of the fund to pay you.”  It is not uncommon to see a risk factor of 7 assigned to similar products by virtue of crypto's higher price volatility, according to 21Shares communications manager Megan Enright. In an email to CoinDesk Enright said that ""this risk indicator aligns with the risk classification of products offered by other issuers as well, which take historical prices into account, and is set by the regulatory framework. Even in the traditional finance space, it is not uncommon to see risk factors of 6 or 7.""  Liquid staking enables users to maintain liquidity, despite locking their cryptocurrency to earn rewards for securing a blockchain network. Lido, the dominant liquid staking player, has more than $13 billion ETH staked, commanding a 76% market share of liquid staking derivatives on Ethereum, data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen show.

Despite a recent surge of over 6% in the last 24 hours, the bearish sentiment continues to exert its influence. Over the past week, Cardano has encountered a loss of approximately 26% in value, resulting in the breaking of crucial support levels that have now transformed into resistance levels. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Traders Anxiously Await Shibarium Launch Date Amidst Uncertainty From a technical outlook, Cardano indicates a prevailing bearish trend, with both demand and accumulation levels remaining relatively low. It becomes crucial for the coin to overcome the overhead resistance in order to mitigate the growing strength of bearish forces and facilitate a potential recovery. Presently, the coin is oversold, prompting the emergence of buyers aiming to surpass the resistance barriers. Furthermore, the decline in Bitcoin’s value in recent days, as it revisited the $26,000 level, has had a negative impact on various altcoins, including Cardano. Consequently, the market capitalization of Cardano has declined, indicating diminished buying strength in the market. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ADA was trading at $0.28, at the time of writing. Following its rejection at the $0.34 level, the bears have taken control of the price trajectory. Presently, ADA has revisited a multi-month low price level. This signified a bearish trend and the crucial resistance level for the altcoin is observed at $0.30. Should ADA face rejection at this level, there is a possibility of the price descending further below its current level. In the event of further depreciation, the coin may find support initially at $0.25 and potentially even lower. The trading volume for Cardano in the last session was relatively low, suggesting that sellers currently hold an advantage in the market. Technical Analysis Following the rejection at $0.34, Cardano (ADA) has struggled to regain positive momentum and attract demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped below the half-line and even further below the 30-mark, indicating that the coin is significantly undervalued and oversold. Furthermore, the price of ADA has dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, suggesting that selling pressure is currently driving the price momentum. In order to revive demand in the market, ADA needs to overcome the resistance level of $0.30. Breaching this crucial barrier could potentially ignite a recovery and attract buyers back into the market. Due to the low demand for ADA, sell signals have emerged, suggesting a potential continuation of the downtrend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which indicates price momentum and potential reversals, has formed red signal bars, aligning with sell signals for ADA.

42393348,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOzPp,1686577812,"A $1,200 Baseball Hat? Why Disco's Swag Is 'Prohibitively Expensive'","Do you remember The Jetsons, the futuristic family from the eponymous 1960s American animated sitcom? In the show, household appliances programmed to know family members’ intimate preferences helped the characters navigate each segment of their days, from breakfast to bedtime routines.  Disco, a metaverse company focused on consent-based digital identity, is working to create a similar vision for the metaverse. And it starts, according to co-founder and CEO Evin McMullen, with the perhaps-less-sexy but nonetheless foundational concept of user-owned data.  As McMullen points out in a recent podcast interview, The Jetsons, who regularly utilized robot sidekicks, didn’t ever wait in line or fill out forms to make their preferences known. Jane simply awoke to a closet of freshly ironed clothes, and George’s toothbrush robot simply “knew” how much toothpaste (and presumably what flavor) to place on the bristles.  “They had personalized experiences everywhere they went,” said McMullen in the episode. But how?  The answer is data. On the internet, data and identity are basically synonymous — and valuable. An individual’s online behavior — their purchases, browsing history, social groups, user names, pronouns, passwords, primary languages, biometrics, etc. — create a digital body of information telling a story about who that person is.  Disco wants to encourage individual consumers to take back control of their data by incentivizing them to move it from siloed, company-owned platforms to user-owned digital wallets that serve as the key to unlocking online experiences.  There’s just one problem: Consumers are kind of lazy and used to the frictionless experience of single sign-on services like Amazon or Facebook. Even if people are convinced of the value of user-owned identity or spooked by controversies like Facebook’s infamous Cambridge Analytica lawsuit, which exposed the release of some 87 million users’ data, there’s currently little incentive to transition away from today’s company-owned, or “federated,” identity model to one where users are our own data custodians.  But they are motivated by gamification, status and money. Here’s where $1,208 hats and $2,416 T-shirts advertising “Big DID energy” (“DID” is an abbreviation for “decentralized identifier”) fit in. Disco is making its swag free for users who earn it — and prohibitively expensive for everyone else. McMullen calls this strategy a “meme” to help people grasp the potential of Web3 and feel inspired to take back control of their data. Even those who work in the blockchain industry, she argues, aren’t yet fully realizing the potential of user-owned identity.  “When we originally came up with the idea, the price of ETH was around $1,200,” she said. “So we thought that 1 ETH would be a good price because that's often the price of blue-chip NFTs.” However, she noted, the Disco team couldn't find an easy way to sync Shopfiy with the real-time price of ETH and apply the discount codes accordingly, so the team slapped a $1,208 price tag on its hats and doubled the price for shirts.  Verifiable credentials and decentralized identity management  “One of the challenges that I've learned over the years is that helping folks in Web3 realize our ecosystem is more than just what you can see on chain … is a little esoteric for a lot of people to grasp,” McMullen recently told CoinDesk.  “Our identity is a co-created verb,” McMullen said. “It is a living, ongoing experience that we co-create with the people and parties around us as a function of how we interact.”  McMullen argues that not all consumer data should live on the blockchain. Instead, we ought to use the full breadth of cryptographic tools to enjoy the functionality of token-gated experiences without requiring that all information about oneself is published as an immutable token, such as a non-fungible token (NFT) or soulbound token (SBT).  One such tool, known as a verifiable credential, offers an off-chain alternative that can authenticate aspects of consumer data without publishing it publicly. “In the same way that a token on chain can unlock access, an off-chain credential with the very same keys that I use on chain can unlock experiences,” McMullen said.  A concept well-known by long-time technologists and cryptographers, verifiable credentials are relatively new to the general population. Disco describes them as a way for any third-party entity, such as a university, employer or government agency, to issue secure credentials to a recipient without revealing sensitive data in the process. In a scenario that pro-privacy technologists hope might happen in the near future, a university could issue a diploma through a platform like Disco, which an employer could verify without the need to access more information than is required to verify the requirements of the job.  McMullen says using verifiable credentials may help consumers prevent the mistake of putting sensitive information — particularly about minors — on chain. This may also lessen the risk of discriminatory practices, such as revealing a person’s age, religious background or ethnicity when it is not required.  “There are not a lot of women I know who would feel comfortable putting their home address on a billboard in Times Square,” McMullen said. “Yet, putting it on the blockchain is more public and more permanent.”  To help consumers grasp this concept, Disco has opened up its API to beta testers, inviting them to create user-owned “data backpacks” containing credentials that they may choose to share or keep private. These credentials may contain personal information about each user’s identity, along with lighthearted social credentials that exist more for the purpose of fun and status, such as the “GM” (slang for “good morning”) credential. Individuals who have completed Disco onboarding and set up their data backpack can redeem their credentials at checkout for free merch, minus shipping and handling. Those who want to pay in USD, well, will have to pay a lot.  The process of issuing a credential looks like this:  Step one: Create a backpack and complete onboarding  Signing up for Disco requires showing proof of owning keys to a third-party profile, such as Discord or Twitter.  Step two: Receive your first credential  Once you complete onboarding, you will receive the Official Disconaut Credential and be able to receive GMs from your friends. By default, credentials appear in your Disco account as private, but as a consent-first platform, users can toggle public visibility on or off depending on their preferences.  Step three: Add more credentials  Personalize your account by adding details about yourself, which you can share however you like.  Step four: Issue credentials  Send “GM” credentials to fellow Disco users.  Sending 15 unique GMs will qualify you for some free merch, like this $2,416 t-shirt.  Step five: Shop for merch  Depending on the number of credentials you’ve earned, you’ll be eligible to choose from Disco caps, t-shirts and more. Make sure your credentials are set to “publicly viewable” for Shopify to redeem your free merch. You can do this in your data backpack under the specific credential and clicking the eye icon in the top right hand corner.  Additionally, owning NFTs from certain partner communities may also qualify you for special merch deals. For instance, these disco ball earrings are $50 USD, or 15 unique GMs, for Boys Club members.  Embracing the learning curve  It may seem like Disco is making consumers jump through a lot of hoops for some earrings, but that’s kind of the point. “The swag store is using the Disco API and checking users’ data backpack to see if they have the right credentials to enjoy a discount,” McMullen explained.  While the process may seem clunky compared to our more familiar social media platforms, McMullen argues that embracing the learning curve is essential, calling the tendency to store personal information on blockchain an “expensive overshare” that often comes with high gas (service) fees.  Fortunately, we don’t have to reinvent every new aspect of decentralized identity, as some legal frameworks already exist to help guide decisions about what information should exist online (and therefore on the blockchain). McMullen pointed to the Child Online Privacy Protection Act, enacted in the U.S. in 1998, and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective as of 2018, among others.  While she noted that such laws may not be wholly comprehensive, nor universally liked among technologists and consumers, McMullen emphasized the responsibility of early Web3 builders to handle data sensitively.  “Building tools that can endanger others is not what we're about at Disco,” she said. “It's very important to introduce consent-first data.”  According to McMullen, Web3 enthusiasts tend to think of blockchain as a panacea solving for all aspects of consumer privacy, when in actuality, blockchain is simply a distributed database of information. Disco’s mission is to help individuals to understand and decide what should and should not be on chain before those decisions about our digital identities are made for us.

The company reported that trading volume for cryptocurrencies dropped to $2.1 billion in May, down 43% from the prior month. On a yearly basis, crypto trading volume slowed 68%, it said.  Daily average trading revenue (DART), a metric that tracks the average trade per day that generated commissions or fees, was down 22% in May and 53% year-over-year for crypto trading.  Just last week, Robinhood delisted three tokens as part of its regular review, leaving only 15 cryptocurrencies available for trading on the platform, the company said. The delisted tokens, Cardano's ADA, Polygon's MATIC, and Solana's SOL, were named as securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in recent lawsuits against Coinbase (COIN) and Binance.  Robinhood Markets’ chief compliance lawyer Dan Gallagher told lawmakers that the company was trying to register as a special-purpose broker for digital assets in 2021, but the conversations weren’t successful.  Both Coinbase and Binance were hit with lawsuits earlier this month on accusations of violating U.S. securities laws. Robinhood has so far only received an investigative subpoena from the SEC regarding its crypto operations, it revealed in its 10-K filing in February.

13740659,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537498,1686576607,"Peter Brandt Asserts Bitcoin’s Superiority, Calls Other Crypto Assets Scams","Renowned trading professional Peter Brandt recently made waves in the cryptocurrency community with his firm belief that Bitcoin (BTC) is the only crypto asset worth considering, dismissing Ethereum (ETH) and other digital currencies as mere imitators or scams. Brandt, a seasoned foreign exchange trader with a wealth of experience, boldly stated on Twitter that Bitcoin stands as the sole contender to emerge victorious in the marathon of the crypto industry. According to him, all other digital assets, including Ethereum, lack the potential for long-term success and should be regarded with caution. The trader’s remark was triggered by a statement from Cheds, a prominent crypto trader, who asserted that Bitcoin remains the “safest” bet in the volatile crypto landscape. Cheds’ assertion came in the wake of a recent market collapse that caused a significant decline in the value of many altcoins. Bitcoin Is The Only Reliable Option In Crypto Brandt’s position on Bitcoin as the only reliable crypto asset has been consistent over time. He has often expressed skepticism about the potential of most altcoins, maintaining that the majority of them will eventually collapse to zero. In his view, Bitcoin is the legacy coin that will stand the test of time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Miners Sell At 3rd Largest Scale Ever “Bitcoin is the ONLY bet in crypto that will finish the marathon. All others are just wanna bees or scams, including ETH,” Brandt emphasized, showing his unwavering confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Interestingly, when asked about Ethereum, Brandt drew a comparison to precious metals, likening Ethereum to silver while positioning Bitcoin as the equivalent of gold. “Silver is to ETH as Gold is to BTC. ETH will likely survive but BTC is the legacy,” the trader said. While he acknowledged Ethereum’s survival potential, Brandt emphasized that Bitcoin remains the leading digital currency and the standard against which others should be measured. BTC price falls below $26,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Brandt’s stance on altcoins, including Ethereum, extends back to June 2022 when he criticized the Ethereum Merge, describing it as a “piece of cr*p crypto” due to the network’s inefficiencies and high transaction fees. He went so far as to compare the Merge to a rebuild of the ill-fated LZ 129 Hindenburg airship. Despite his skepticism, Brandt did offer analysis on XRP earlier this year, projecting a minimum target of $3 for the asset. However, he generally maintains little interest in assets that he believes will ultimately plummet to zero. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Traders Anxiously Await Shibarium Launch Date Amidst Uncertainty While Brandt remains confident in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, he continues to caution against the excessive enthusiasm and fervor displayed by some Bitcoin holders, referring to it as a “bad religion” that can cloud judgment. In conclusion, Peter Brandt’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin as the only reliable crypto asset and his dismissal of others as scams or imitators reflect his extensive experience and expertise in the trading world.

What are NFTs? Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets on a blockchain representing anything from artwork to music to in-game items. The NFT market landscape has been transformed by the emergence of new projects, platforms, and technologies and changing trends in the cryptocurrency space. How to Mint NFTs To mint an NFT, you must create a digital asset and then ""mint"" it or turn it into an NFT. Here are the steps on how to mint an NFT: Choose a blockchain. Many blockchains support NFTs, such as Ethereum, Solana, and Flow. Each blockchain has its advantages and disadvantages, so you must choose one that is right for you. Create a digital asset. This can be anything from artwork to a song to a video. The digital asset must be unique and cannot be easily copied. For example, you can create unique DUCKIES NFTs in an educational NFT minting & melding game to turn common NFTs into legendary and mythic ones. Choose an NFT marketplace. There are many different NFT marketplaces where you can mint and sell your NFTs. Some popular marketplaces include OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare. Connect your wallet. To mint and sell NFTs, you must connect a crypto wallet to the NFT marketplace. Some popular crypto wallets include MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. Mint your NFT. Once you have connected your wallet to the NFT marketplace, you can mint your NFT. The minting process will vary depending on the marketplace but typically involves paying a gas fee. Where to Sell NFTs Once you have minted your NFT, you can sell it on an NFT marketplace. There are many different NFT marketplaces, so you must choose one that is right for you. Some factors to consider include the marketplace's fees, the number of users, and the type of NFTs typically sold. Here are some of the most popular NFT marketplaces: OpenSea: OpenSea is the largest NFT marketplace, with over 2 million users. It supports various NFTs, including artwork, music, and in-game items. You can host entire NFT collections. Here’s an example of DUCKIES NFTs hosted for sale at OpenSea. Rarible: Rarible is a popular NFT marketplace that allows users to create and sell their NFTs. It also supports a wide variety of NFTs. SuperRare: SuperRare is a high-end NFT marketplace that focuses on high-quality artwork. It has a smaller user base than OpenSea or Rarible but also has higher prices. Tips for Selling NFTs Here are some tips for selling NFTs: Set a fair price. When setting a price for your NFT, it is important to consider the value of similar NFTs sold. You do not want to price your NFT too high, or it will not sell. For example, the Mythic DUCKIES are sold for over $1,000 at OpenSea. Promote your NFT. Once you have listed your NFT for sale, you must promote it to attract buyers. You can do this by sharing it on social media, listing it on other NFT marketplaces, or joining NFT communities. Be patient. It may take some time to sell your NFT. Do not get discouraged if it does not sell immediately. Just keep promoting it, and eventually, you will find a buyer. Conclusion Minting and selling NFTs can be a great way to showcase your creativity and make money out of it. However, it is important to research and understand the risks involved before you start.

42393333,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOyQH,1686573639,Blockchain Staking Provider Chorus One Expands to Peer-to-Peer Network Urbit,"Chorus One, a provider of staking services for more than 40 blockchains and protocols including Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and Polkadot, is joining a growing field of hosting service providers on the Urbit peer-to-peer network.  The new hosting platform, called Red Horizon, marks the first foray onto the Urbit network by a major blockchain or technology player that was not originally building within the close-knit ecosystem, according to Chorus One's Gary Lieberman.  Urbit is a peer-to-peer network that works largely by giving each user a ""personal server"" to store their own data; when users interact over the network, they each keep local records of those interactions. It was started in 2002 well before Bitcoin's launch in 2009.  The network isn't technically a blockchain but shares many of the same ideals, such as trying to short-circuit middlemen and centralized ""Web2"" applications that dominate online activity and profit partly by monetizing users' data.  The new hosting service could be ""ideal for the general public, DAOs and any other community interested in leaving MegaCorps behind,"" according to Chorus One's press release on the launch. A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization – a type of group that's governed by computer code and token holders, in contrast to a company owned by shareholders and managed by executives.  A frequent criticism of Urbit – acknowledged even by top developers within the ecosystem – is that it's complicated to understand and difficult to use. The introduction of hosting providers grew partly out of an effort to attract more users – essentially making it easy for people to easily get an ID on the network in exchange for a fee.  In May, Urbit Foundation Executive Director Josh Lehman (known as ~wolref-podlex on Urbit) gave a presentation at CoinDesk's Consensus 2023 conference noting that the number of IDs or ""ships"" on the network had surged over the past year, as more hosting services became available.  Urbit's website shows three hosting providers currently up and running, including Tlon, the for-profit company that sponsored the network's development until 2021.  Providing a hosting service for Urbit seemed like a natural extension of Chorus One's staking services for blockchain networks, Lieberman told CoinDesk in an interview.  ""We’re anticipating that Urbit itself is going to be a product that a lot of people are going to want to use,"" said Lieberman, who goes by ~tiller-tolbus on Urbit. ""Hosting was somewhat of an obvious place to go.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | SOL | SPONSORED,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/12/blockchain-staking-provider-chorus-one-expands-to-peer-to-peer-network-urbit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff3c602eb42767fbcf21a2f21e1e95e733a6f883-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) chose London as the site for its first office outside the U.S., saying the U.K. government is willing to create policies that encourage startups to pursue decentralization. Menlo Park, California-based a16z said it plans to use the office – which will open later this year and be led by Sriram Krishnan – to invest in the crypto and startup ecosystem in the U.K. and Europe. The firm cited a number of recent investments in U.K.-based companies, among them a new $43 million Series A funding round into blockchain-based computing resources for artificial intelligence platforms (AI) provider Gensyn.  Open interest tied to Binance's BNB token continues to rise, according to data tracked by Coinglass. Total open interest – the number of unsettled and active futures contracts – rose to 1.57 million BNB ($360 million at current prices) on Monday, the highest since Jan. 1. The tally has increased by over 8% in the past 24 hours and nearly 27% in the days since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance on June 5. Alongside, BNB's going market rate has tumbled from about $300 to the current $234, its weakest level since mid-December, per CoinDesk data. The common thought among traders is that an increase in open interest alongside a price decline suggests an influx of short positions or bearish bets and thus possibly confirmation of a downtrend.  A key metric tracking crypto market liquidity tanked sharply over the weekend, leaving paper-thin order books that could amplify price swings. Crypto research firm Hyblock Capital's global bid and ask indicator – which aggregates the dollar amount of resting bid and ask orders for more than 1,100 coins listed worldwide – fell by 20% across spot markets on Saturday. The sharp decline happened as alternative cryptocurrencies like SOL, MATIC, DOGE and others tumbled amid rumors of a fund liquidating its coin holdings. According to crypto hedge fund Assymetric's CIO Joe McCann, some market makers likely pulled out from the market during the altcoin plunge, causing a sharp fall in the amount of resting bid and ask orders.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows seven-day ETH call-put skew, which measures the difference between prices for bullish call options and bearish put options tied to Ethereum's native token.  The seven-day skew slipped to -9% over the weekend, signaling the strongest bias for puts since mid-March.

As one of the top cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, Cardano has been closely impacted by broader market trends. This setback has raised questions about the future trajectory of Cardano and whether the bulls will be able to regain control.

However, the cryptocurrency has endured a significant decline of 24.3% over the course of the last seven days. ADA performing poorly on the weekly timeframe. Source: Coingecko This decline follows a retreat from ADA’s highest price level in 2023, reaching $0.462 in mid-April, before dropping to lows of $0.221 in December. The coin has since managed to partially recover from the losses. The technical indicators for the ADA/USD pair show a significant negative trend developing.

Cardano market cap slightly below $10 billion.

ADA Price Outlook Depends On BTC And Market Sentiment The current market conditions for ADA remain uncertain as the cryptocurrency faces selling pressure and price volatility. With increased trading volumes and a decline in price, ADA could potentially be dragged further down to support levels at $0.22 or even $0.164 if the bearish sentiment persists and Bitcoin fails to transition to a bullish trend.

The company's open source “decentralized key management” approach does away with the complex and expensive trappings of multiparty computation (MPC), a key-sharding technology popular in the institutional crypto custody arena.  “If you’re an organization requiring key management, you tend to go to a third-party MPC service provider – Fireblocks, Copper etc – which is centralized, usually closed source, often very expensive, and it’s sort of cumbersome in to interact with,” CEO Andrew Lawrence said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Institution-grade custody for digital assets has traditionally been costly and not straightforward, employing new technologies like MPC that require specialized hardware and software. That's spurred the emergence of a crop of safe-keeping solutions espousing open, accessible and cheaper approaches.  The Censo model is to use the secure hardware enclaves present in today’s mobile devices, together with their biometric gating, to tightly bind cryptographic keys to real-world agents, according to the firm’s white paper.  “It makes a very compelling case as an alternative to MPC for organizations who want truly decentralized key management and self custody,” said Brett Falk, a research assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania in a statement.

Bitcoin Miner Inflow To Exchanges Has Registered A Spike Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, miner exchange inflows hit a peak value of $70 million recently. The “miner inflow to exchanges” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that miners are transferring to the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is high, it means the miners are sending a large number of coins to these platforms currently. Generally, these chain validators deposit their BTC to exchanges for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can have a bearish effect on the value of the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, low values suggest the selling pressure coming from the miners may be low right now, as this cohort isn’t depositing any significant amounts to exchanges at the moment. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Sharks & Whales Rapidly Accumulate, Why This Is Bullish For Bitcoin Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner inflow to exchanges over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin miner inflow to exchanges has observed a spike in its value recently. This suggests that miners have been sending rather large amounts to these platforms during the past couple of weeks. Related Reading: Here’s How Current Bitcoin Capitulation Compares With Past Crashes These high values of the indicator have come as the cryptocurrency has been gradually heading downwards. This may imply that the recent market environment has made some of the miners panic sell their holdings. Since these inflows have become elevated, the asset’s value has only extended its decline further, as it has now dropped below the $26,000 level. This recent decline in the price may be fueled in part by the dumping being done by this cohort. From the chart, it’s visible that the peak of these inflows observed on 3rd June saw the indicator reach a value of around $70.8 million. This is a historically extraordinary level for the metric as only two trading days in the entire lifetime of the coin have seen the miners depositing at a larger scale. Both of the instances where miners sent larger amounts to these platforms took place way back during early 2021, when the bull market was in full flow. The peak inflow spike back then (that is, the largest value the metric has ever recorded) measured to about $101 million, implying that the current surge is about $30.2 million away from it. Naturally, Bitcoin miners selling at such a high rate recently can be bad news for the market. It now remains to be seen whether these chain validators continue to sell more in the near future, or if they are done with their dumping spree for now.

Crypto research firm Hyblock Capital's global bid and ask indicator, which aggregates the dollar amount of resting bid and ask orders for more than 1,100 coins listed worldwide, fell by 20% across spot markets on Saturday.  The sharp decline happened as alternative cryptocurrencies like SOL, MATIC, DOGE and others crashed amid rumors of a fund liquidating its coin holdings.  According crypto hedge fund Assymetric's CIO Joe McCann, some market makers likely pulled out from the market during the altcoin crash, causing a sharp decline in the amount of resting bid and ask orders.  ""The @hyblockcapital Global Bid/Ask metric dropped a full 20% during the collapse. Seems like a bunch of MMs [market makers] pulled inventory creating paper-thin order books,"" McCann tweeted. Other observers argued that the decline in liquidity stemmed from a single market maker running out of collateral.  Thin liquidity means traders might struggle to execute large orders at stable prices. It also means a bunch of small orders can have an outsized impact on the going market rate.  The order book lists all outstanding orders and quotes in a particular financial instrument posted by market makers and other market participants. The bid is the highest price the user is willing to pay to buy the instrument, while the ask or offer is the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell the instrument. A resting order is a limit order to buy at a price below or to sell at a price above the going market rate.  Market makers are entities responsible for creating bid and ask orders and providing liquidity to an order book.  The green line represents the dollar amount of resting bid orders and the red indicates the resting ask orders. Both collapsed over 20% to under $500 million during Saturday's Asian hours.  The decline in liquidity means the market could see above-average volatility following the U.S. inflation data release and the Federal Reserve rate decision. The U.S. consumer price index is scheduled for release on Tuesday at 12:30 UTC and the Fed is expected to maintain a status quo in policy rates on Wednesday at 18:00 UTC, per Reuters data from FXStreet.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | DOGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/12/crypto-global-bid-and-ask-metric-points-to-paper-thin-order-books,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f15dd226a8c2429fd531c190ce99800f814d1339-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the upcoming launch of Shibarium, which promises to provide a dedicated ecosystem for SHIB enthusiasts, excitement has been running high. However, despite the buzz surrounding the project, the exact date of Shibarium’s release remains a mystery, leaving traders and community members eager for more information. When will Shibarium finally make its grand entrance into the world of Shiba Inu trading? Shiba Inu Traders Await Shibarium Launch The Shiba Inu community, eagerly anticipating the release of Shibarium’s mainnet, finds themselves in a state of uncertainty due to recent updates. LucieSHIB, a prominent promoter of Shiba Inu, initially announced that the highly anticipated Shibarium mainnet would be launched sometime between the second and third quarters of 2023. However, the same source has now hinted at a potential delay in the previously anticipated launch date, raising doubts among traders and enthusiasts. #Shibarium is not coming this month, and there’s a BIG MAYBE it will come in the next 2-3 months. However, since we have waited this long, we can wait a few more weeks. Meanwhile, let’s enjoy the things that will come before, such as Metaverse teasers or new $SHIB achievements.… pic.twitter.com/PAhqpXOuxf — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) June 9, 2023 Although there is uncertainty surrounding the exact timing of the mainnet launch, significant advancements have been observed on the Shibarium testnet.

Shibarium: At A Glance Shibarium is a forthcoming and long-awaited Layer 2 blockchain solution for Shiba Inu that aims to resolve Ethereum’s slow transaction speed. Its purpose is to set the groundwork for constructing the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which will include a metaverse, a DEX, and blockchain games. An illustration of Shibarium. Image: Vcgamers As of the latest report, the testnet has witnessed an impressive number of transactions, surpassing 19.4 million. Furthermore, there are currently over 16.7 million wallet addresses and more than 1.2 million blocks within the testnet. These figures demonstrate the active engagement and growing interest within the Shiba Inu community, despite the lingering uncertainty about the official launch date of Shibarium. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Dips Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently being traded at a price of $0.00000662, as reported by CoinGecko. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 1.7% decline within the last 24 hours. This downward trend becomes even more pronounced when considering the past seven days, as SHIB has seen a significant decline of 22.4%. Source: Coingecko The recent price drop has pushed SHIB into a strong bear trend, indicating a notable downward movement. This bearish sentiment is further supported by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which has fallen below 30, placing SHIB in the oversold zone. These indicators reflect a negative market sentiment and suggest that investors are currently more inclined towards selling SHIB tokens. The launch of Shibarium’s mainnet had the potential to act as a catalyst for a potential price rally in SHIB tokens. However, the prevailing uncertainty surrounding the release of Shibarium has added to the bearish sentiment and may have a negative impact on the value of SHIB. As traders and investors await more clarity on the launch date, it remains to be seen how the market will respond to the anticipated event.

42393349,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTA6J,1686564114,SEC Crypto Crackdown Adds Urgency for U.S. Lawmakers to Produce Regulatory Framework This Year: JPMorgan,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase highlight the need for U.S. lawmakers to come up with “a comprehensive framework on how to regulate the crypto industries and the relative responsibilities of SEC vs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),” JPMorgan (JPM) said in a Thursday research report.  The SEC thinks most cryptocurrencies should be classed as securities, and therefore, most crypto companies and trading should fall under its supervision and comply with regulatory frameworks that are currently applied to other securities, the report said.  This isn't a “straightforward legal case,” and it is unclear which cryptocurrencies would be classified as securities, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. The SEC vs Ripple case is a reflection of this lack of legal clarity.  The regulator said last week it was suing Binance, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the operating company for Binance.US on allegations of violating federal securities laws. A day later it sued rival exchange Coinbase (COIN) on similar charges.  The moves are “creating more urgency for U.S. lawmakers to come up with a comprehensive regulatory framework by this year,” JPMorgan said.  Until this happens, crypto activity will likely continue to move outside the U.S. and into decentralized entities. Crypto venture capital funding will also likely remain subdued, the bank said.  If the SEC’s stance is confirmed by lawmakers, Coinbase, Binance.US and other U.S. exchanges would have to register as brokers and most cryptocurrencies would be treated as securities, the note said.  While this could be more “onerous and costly” for the industry, it would bring some positives because crypto markets would be properly regulated and offer more transparency and investor protection, the note said.  Last week’s SEC actions has created uncertainty about a number of other layer 1 tokens that are alleged to be securities, creating an advantage for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the bank said.

The firm cites the UK’s welcoming crypto climate. The crypto investment arm of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, a16z, announced it would be opening its first overseas office in London. The firm celebrated the UK’s welcoming embrace of the crypto industry as the motivating factor behind its decision. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the UK has established a warm climate for crypto companies as the industry battles regulatory confusion from the US. Big news to share: @a16z is expanding to the UK 🇬🇧We plan to open our first international office in London later this year, and will host the next Crypto Startup School there in 2024.Why the UK? 👇https://t.co/PQ7GuNEn77 — cdixon.eth (@cdixon) June 11, 2023 Bloomberg reports the new office will open later this year and will be led by Sriram Krishnan, one of the firm’s general partners. a16z said in a statement: While there is still work to be done, we believe that the UK is on the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation. The UK also has deep pools of talent, world-leading academic institutions, and a strong entrepreneurial culture. It is home to more “unicorns” than Germany, France, and Sweden combined; to some of the world’s largest financial markets and pools of capital; and to highly-sophisticated, world-class regulators. All of these make the UK strongly positioned to lead in web3. Prime Minister Sunak welcomed the firm’s decision and underscored the UK’s commitment to establishing the country as the “world’s Web3 centre.” Great news that @a16z – one of the world’s leading tech investment firms, is opening a new base here in London.Another huge vote of confidence in the UK as a place to build and grow tech businesses of the future. https://t.co/Ey1ykALkSU pic.twitter.com/caP6nNXfow — Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 12, 2023 The Prime Minister said: “As we cement the UK’s place as a science and tech superpower, we must embrace new innovations like Web3, powered by blockchain technology, which will enable start-ups to flourish here and grow the economy.” Crypto Firms Are Being Driven Offshore The US SEC recently launched severe regulatory action against two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. On June 5, the agency filed suit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, for alleged securities violations. The following day, the agency filed a similar case against Coinbase. It charged the exchange with “the unregistered offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.” The US’s aggressive approach led the market to spiral, with major altcoins seeing double-digit losses. UK’s Regulatory Approach Recognising the need for regulatory guidance, crypto firms such as Coinbase have long asked the US to provide clarity regarding crypto assets. The US has, however, been reluctant to comply, which only creates further tension in the industry. Crypto firms have, therefore, been testing the waters in other countries where guidance has been offered. When Prime Minister Sunak was still Chancellor of the Exchequer, he made it clear that he would guide the UK into becoming a safe space for digital assets where innovation and industry development are encouraged. While the UK has been lagging in regulatory guidance compared to the European Union, it has recently published several planned regulations. The UK Treasury Committee released a report in May advising the government to regulate retail crypto trading not as financial assets but as gambling instruments. The Committee said that unbacked mainstream crypto assets and their inherent volatility pose a risk to investors and threaten economic stability. Last week, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) released a set of crypto marketing rules that take effect on October 8. Under its stricter marketing guidelines, the agency banned incentive bonuses, free NFTs and airdrops for promotional purposes and introduced a “cooling-off” period for first-time crypto buyers.

Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov has deposited $24 million worth of Curve DAO (CRV) tokens to decentralized lending platform Aave to mitigate the liquidation risk of a $65 million stablecoin loan.  Egorov began borrowing stablecoins on Aave in April, with $37 million worth of tether (USDT) being sent to crypto exchange Bitfinex whilst $51 million in USDC was sent to prominent market maker Wintermute, according to blockchain sleuth Lookonchain.

Crypto innovation is being driven from the U.S. but will continue as it is welcomed with open arms in other regions of the world, with the biggest losers being the U.S. and the biggest winners being other crypto-friendly countries. The flight to safety and quality is likely to persist, making BTC and ETH long-term outperformers in digital assets, while DeFi will likely dominate more of crypto trading as centralized exchanges face regulatory pressures. The SEC recently filed lawsuits against Coinbase ( COIN ) and Binance for operating unregistered securities exchanges. They are also accusing Binance of misusing customer funds and violating other securities laws. Binance is doubtlessly the biggest crypto company in the world, responsible for introducing millions of people worldwide to digital assets. Binance’s international platform offers spot and derivatives trading for a huge variety of coins and tokens. Binance’s operations within the U.S. have been muted out of caution for U.S. regulations. Filling that void within the U.S. has been Coinbase. Coinbase is directly responsible for introducing millions of Americans to crypto. It doesn’t offer derivatives on its platform (at least not for Americans), but users can trade assets from many different blockchains and send their assets to self-custodied wallets. Binance and Coinbase are titans in crypto, but the recent aggression by the SEC was something we in the crypto industry have seen coming for a while. Cryptocurrencies sold off as the news hit, quickly rebounded the next day, and has been trending down in the last few days. So what can we expect for crypto going forward? There are many ways to answer this question because there are different facets of crypto which are simultaneously relevant but also rapidly changing in relevance. I will first talk about the big picture of how overall blockchain-related innovation will be impacted, and then narrow the focus onto investments in the digital assets space. I intend to minimize discussions centered on predicting what the U.S. government will do because there is just too much uncertainty in that realm right now given upcoming elections, the already intense scrutiny Mr. Gary Gensler is facing, and U.S. monetary policy. The most important reason, however, is that crypto is much, much bigger than it seems in America or to the average American. There is, after all, a whole world outside the Land of the Free. We Americans would do well to remember that. A Futile Assault on Innovation The bottom line is that innovation in blockchain and digital assets will be relatively unscathed by this motion. Crypto as an industry will be fine in the medium to long term, as long as there is no grand conspiracy to create a worldwide Orwellian surveillance state and roll out a global Central Bank Digital Currency ((CBDC)). What will certainly suffer is America’s part in the crypto industry, because talent will be driven offshore by such aggressive maneuvers. To be fair to the U.S. government, they need to do a lot of face-saving after letting something like FTX blow up so spectacularly without encountering major regulatory obstacles. The pendulum has swung from mildly dovish to extremely hawkish, mostly to give the political image of a regulatory body that is justly enforcing its functions. Also, there are ample instances of regulatory arbitrage throughout the digital assets space, where insiders and venture investors are basically using retail as exit liquidity for crypto startups with dubious utility. Moreover, much of crypto’s utility today is little more than price speculation. The Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ecosystem is mostly composed of decentralized applications cater to speculators by providing high amounts of leverage and abnormally high “yield” from shuffling around tokens. Unfortunately, speculation for speculation’s sake is the current body and soul of DeFi. But the reality is the SEC has been rather unclear with regulations and unwilling to work with teams who had every intention of operating in the good faith. As a result, innovators have been and will continue to move out of the U.S. to protect their business. This ultimately will not have a negative impact on innovation. Again, America’s role will be substantially reduced, but overall progress in the realm of blockchain technology, Web3, and DeFi will be untouched. Software’s online nature makes the transition only as difficult as setting up a corporate entity in another country and geo-fencing U.S. IP addresses in app frontends. Development continues, and with some American developers moving abroad, the U.S. loses tax revenue from corporations and personal income. Other countries have understandably welcomed the brain drain out of the U.S. crypto industry. Who doesn’t want extra money? Value-creating crypto startups will continue to receive financing from U.S. based investors. Most startups are financed by VCs who are not restricted to U.S. based ventures. Because building doesn’t really stop, the selloffs induced by high-profile regulatory aggression are great buying opportunities for blue-chip digital assets. Also, as DeFi coalesces around vertical integration and prioritizing user experience – important elements which are currently underserved in DeFi – the individual winners in the crypto protocol space will become more apparent. The biggest losers under the current path is the U.S. and the biggest winners are other crypto-friendly countries. Crypto itself is largely unaffected by this drama. Other Countries Take The Hint The news of Hong Kong opening licensing to crypto exchanges drew some attention in the crypto industry. China implemented a rather high-profile crackdown on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining and all crypto activities back in mid-2021. Two years later, the Chinese government seems to be reconsidering its stance on crypto, seemingly using Hong Kong’s politically distinct status as a testing ground before rolling out a more comprehensive set of procedures for the Mainland. Note that China used a similar playbook to introduce and examine the impacts of their own CBDC: the digital yuan (or e-CNY). From this article : The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China’s central bank, first began trialing the e-CNY app in April 2020 when it launched internal testing in four cities. This pilot program has since gradually been expanded through invites and cash incentives to eventually reach 140 million registered users by October 2021, according to the PBOC. The Chinese Communist Party ((CCP)) maintains a tight hold over the Chinese economy, so observing the effects of monetary infrastructure in siloed systems is their most prudent strategy for implementing monetary innovations like blockchain. The fact that they have done a big pivot from their staunch anti-crypto stance two years ago to implement a similar trial in Hong Kong should not be taken as a red herring. Another example is El Salvador, which is incentivizing innovation by eliminating taxes on various technological industries. El Salvador recently appointed Dr. Saifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard , as the economic adviser to their National Bitcoin Office. Furthermore, the country has been exploring educational opportunities for its citizens to learn about Bitcoin, and specifically Lightning Network, development. These are decisive moves to welcome crypto innovation. And similar tax incentives and recognitions have been implemented in other countries across the world. One Interesting Thing… As I looked through the accusations of the SEC, I started to notice that the digital assets targeted have mostly been proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies or protocol utility tokens for smart contract applications. The only proof-of-work cryptocurrency on the list was DASH. Below is a list of the cryptocurrencies which has been widely circulated on Twitter, and which can be found in the SEC’s complaints. Next to each ticker I have recorded the consensus mechanism where applicable. SAND, AXS, CHZ, VGX, and NEXO are ERC-20 (fungible) tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, so they do not have a consensus mechanism. ""Securities"" According to SEC (SEC, Coin Market Cap, Compiled by Author) Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is a proof-of-stake chain but it was notably not on the list. The SEC has been vague about whether ETH is a security when questioned before. There has been some uncertainty with ETH in the past because the CFTC has also stated that ETH is a commodity. At any rate, most crypto VC activity occurs on Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine ((EVM)) compatible blockchains, so ETH might be getting a freebie because the regulators don’t want to rock the boat too much. The main takeaway from here is that proof-of-work coins have gotten away without issue. Mr. Gensler has famously declared that everything other than Bitcoin is a security. I offer two conclusions, in light of the SEC lawsuits: Proof-of-Work is indeed a good signal for not being a security because there is no common enterprise besides the miners, and the profitability of miners is not reflected by the price of the cryptocurrency. For instance, Bitcoin miners may be more profitable when the value of BTC goes up, but they are better off in the same way gold miners are more profitable when the value of gold goes up. BTC and gold prices cause their respective miners’ profitability, not the other way around. This seems to solidify PoW coins like BTC, XMR, LTC, DOGE, and BCH as non-securities. The intimate connection between PoW and expending real-world resources makes PoW digital assets resemble commodities. The assets themselves do not generate yield from the efforts of others. Proof-of-Stake is a bit of a red flag because it has features which resemble equities. For example, staking (ie. locking up) the native cryptocurrency is the only way to participate in the consensus of a PoS blockchain. Instead of miners, PoS chains have validators. The difference is that PoS validators do very little computational work to add blocks to the blockchain and earn transaction fees (or inflationary block rewards) while PoW miners perform trillions of tedious, expensive computations to create blocks. The fact that miners work to get paid while stakers don’t do anything makes staking seem passive. The staker is passively rewarded with the cash flows from fees –stakers receive a yield on their crypto. Of course, there are also big differences between equity and PoS. Stakers could get slashed if their validators misbehave. Shareholders will not lose any of their shares if the CFO breaks the law (no one gets their shares taken away from them). Also, anyone can become a validator: the system is entirely permissionless. In contrast, not anyone can just show up and start working for a publically traded company and get paid by shareholders. An Inevitable Growth in DeFi DeFi will probably dominate more of crypto trading now that centralized exchanges are facing pressures from regulators. According to the blockchain analytics firm Nansen , nearly $600 million in crypto were promptly withdrawn from Binance and Coinbase just 24 hours after the lawsuits were announced. Based on the DefiLlama , the net outflows from the top centralized exchanges (CEX) over the last 7 days (as of 10 June 2023) have been huge. $3 billion has flowed out of Binance and some of this has seemingly gone to smaller CEXs like Huobi, Bybit, Kucoin, and OKX. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Where has the funds flowed into? One immediate guess is into DeFi protocols, to taking advantage of DeFi’s permissionless and borderless benefits. Another guess is into self-custodied wallets – signaling that traders have no intention of making trades in the short term but prefer to custody their own funds instead of trusting a pressured centralized entity. Both guesses are probably true. The total value locked (TVL) into DeFi according to Token Terminal has decreased only slightly over the past 7 days (as of 10 June 2023). Much of this decrease can be explained by the broader selloff in crypto following the announcement of the lawsuits. DeFi TVL (Token Terminal) For context, take a glance below at how startling the crypto selloff have been over the past 7 days according to Investing.com . Since TVL of a protocol is calculated in dollar figures of the crypto locked into a protocol’s smart contracts, such large decreases in the prices of major cryptocurrencies more than explains the only slight decreases in TVL. In fact, the best explanation for why DeFi TVL hasn’t decreased nearly as much is that additional crypto has flowed into DeFi from centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. (Note that DeFi protocols may have a large amount of stablecoins locked up, which also diminishes the impact of volatile asset drawdowns to overall TVL.) The stage has seemingly been set for major tailwinds for DeFi. Crypto by Market Cap (Investing.com) What Does This Mean for Digital Asset Investors? A movement to quality and safety is a probable outcome in the next few months. BTC and ETH have been solidified as the undisputed blue chips in digital assets. The fact that they were both untargeted by this round of regulatory aggression speaks volumes. Glancing at the table above, BTC and ETH had mild 7-day selloffs compared to the others. In the case of ETH, the future of smart contract blockchains will probably have to coalesce around the network effect accrued by Ethereum. Most smart contract networks, even if they do not implement the EVM, tend to create a bridging solution for connecting to Ethereum. For instance, Cosmos SDK is a blockchain-building toolkit to create sovereign PoS blockchains. Cosmos chains can be linked to each other via the Interblockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). Most sovereign chains connect to the Cosmos Hub ( ATOM-USD ) to become a part of the Cosmos ecosystem. One of the chains in the ecosystem is the Gravity Bridge , a sovereign Cosmos chain whose only purpose is to link to Ethereum while bridging to other Cosmos chains via IBC. It’s just very hard to get away from Ethereum. The growth of Web3 and DeFi will be beneficial to ETH. BTC is blue chip for a very different reason. It embodies the potential to become true decentralized money – a base layer for the final settlement of liquid value without any trusted intermediaries – among other things. The security of the Bitcoin network is at this point unbreachable by any nation-state. What is added to Bitcoin cannot be removed or altered. Those who use Bitcoin do not experience any downtime. Such a network has enormous value, and one use case happens to resemble money. I discuss the special database aspect of Bitcoin in great detail in this article . Layer 2 developments for both Bitcoin and Ethereum enable more utility and economic activity through scaling. Both blockchains are experiencing advancements in scalability innovations. It is safe to say that the U.S. government has been pretty friendly with these blue chips, particularly Bitcoin. With the high-profile release of pro-Bitcoin discourse like Softwar , increasing discourse about sound money , presidential candidates clarifying their Bitcoin stance , and even long-term critics like Peter Schiff using Bitcoin , there definitely appears to be an underlying shift in public sentiment. Eventually, the truth about blockchain’s utility will become more obvious to people. There is another interesting, and far more speculative, PoW coin on my radar. Monero ( XMR-USD ) is the leading privacy coin. Personally, I like Monero’s technology more than Bitcoin’s for a few reasons. First, XMR is fungible while BTC is not. Because the Monero network ensures privacy in transactions – the sender, receiver, and transaction amounts are all hidden in Monero – there is no way to trace from whom a unique XMR came from. In contrast, BTC can be linked to certain people or activities, which hurts BTC’s fungibility. Imagine if you had a dollar bill that was verifiably spent by some major celebrity – that dollar might not be worth only a dollar anymore. XMR does not have this issue because no one knows where any XMR came from by design. Second, Monero’s RandomX PoW algorithm is ASIC-resistant. Machines cannot be designed to specialize in Monero mining. This decreases the propensity for mining to centralize among miners who can afford capital investments in expensive ASICs which have no other major function besides mining. Miner centralization is an issue for BTC as ASICs dominate BTC mining. The use of RandomX also means that Monero is much better protected against a 51% attack than other PoW chains, assuming equal hashrates. If privacy or miner centralization ever becomes a bigger talking point in crypto or finance, I see XMR as the prime candidate for serious upside. I discuss Monero in greater detail here . Regarding DeFi, most possibilities are highly speculative. The eventual growth and solidification of DeFi activity unfortunately does not translate well to passive investments in specific protocols with multi-year or even multi-month holding periods. This is due to extremely variable tokenomics and great uncertainty of which protocols will stand out over time. Many opportunities in DeFi change from day to day and are subject to highly idiosyncratic strategies involving multiple protocols: very much hands-on. For what it’s worth, ETH is a sure winner from an increase in DeFi activity because all on-chain activity requires ETH to pay gas and operate. Conclusion Crypto innovation is being driven from the U.S. but will continue as it is welcomed with open arms in other regions of the world. The U.S. regulatory position is drawing a distinct delineation between PoW and PoS coins, and this could telegraph future government moves. The flight to safety and quality is likely to persist. This makes BTC and ETH long-term outperformers in digital assets, although there is a fundamental difference in the investment theses of the two. The recent selloffs, and most selloffs induced by issues with centralized exchanges, are good entry points for the long haul. Will Coinbase and Binance be okay despite the outflows? Probably. The end result determined by U.S. courts don’t really matter for global crypto. In the future, I will cover specific DeFi protocols and their protocol tokens as highly speculative investment options.

A16z's move comes as the U.K.'s crypto regulatory outlook is gaining clarity. The government plans to bring crypto into the realms of existing financial services regulation, an approach that is supported by the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for crypto assets. There is some disagreement, however, from the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, which says crypto should be treated like gambling. That proposal has met with backlash by those in the industry.  ""While there is still work to be done, we believe that the U.K. is on the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation,"" a16z said.

13735039,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537439,1686559228,Solana Community Discusses Fork Due To SEC As Price Tanks,"The Solana (SOL) token is one of the biggest losers on the crypto market with a price drop of around 30% in the last seven days. After the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared the Solana token as well as numerous other altcoins as securities in its lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance US, the SOL price plummeted. In a worst-case scenario, the SEC could sue Solana Foundation in the same way it did Ripple Labs in December 2020. Thus, the bottom of the SOL price’s slump might not be reached yet, if the SEC really takes this step and thus causes more investors to panic sell. Solana Community And Developers Oppose The SEC The Solana Foundation has now responded to the SEC’s classification of its SOL token as an unregistered security. In a statement, it said, “The Solana Foundation strongly believes that SOL is not a security,” adding “SOL is the native token to the Solana blockchain, a robust, open-source, community-based software project that relies on decentralized user and developer engagement to expand and evolve.” While one developer at a recent event dismissed the SEC’s legal action, stating that developers “give a shit” about what the SEC thinks, there is a part of the community that is already thinking about possible ways to solve the SEC issue. Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Turns Sell On Rallies As It Breaks $20 The founder of Degen Picks launched a poll within the Solana community on whether the blockchain should fork to avoid the regulatory issues with the SEC. A total of 2,050 people participated in the poll, 39.9% answered “yup” while 24.2% answered “stfu” (shut the fuck up). OK hear me out. It’s time to fork $SOL. SEC dissapears, FTX bankruptcy can dump on themselves. $BTC and $ETH both did it. cc @SOLBigBrain Your reaction? — Caps² (@capsjpeg) June 10, 2023 Surprisingly, the idea is supported by Abracadabra founder @HGEABC. Via Twitter, he responded to the poll, writing, “Bold but not a bad idea actually. Community fork Solana will get rid of SEC issue. No bankruptcy will dump on you for next 3 years continuously. ETH is a fork of ETC and doing well. Blink twice if you agree.” A user then asked the Abracadabra founder if he could get Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and his team to work on the fork. The Abracadabra founder speculated that they “probably will” if they are sued by the SEC. “Then work on the fork save their own problem too.” Remarkably, the Solana Foundation has not yet responded to the poll. Related Reading: Billions Of Dollars Tokenized Bitcoin Moved To Ethereum, BSC, And Solana Overall, however, there are mixed opinions in the community about the fork. It’s also worth noting that proponents don’t have a specific plan for a fork yet. Nevertheless, according to the founder of Degen Picks, a fork could not only solve the SEC problem, but also FTX bankruptcy. A copy of the Solana chain could be given a new set of rules and parameters. The FTX wallets could be blacklisted and not receive the new token. SOL Price Keeps Falling At press time, the SOL price was trading at $15.15. The 1-day chart shows the dicey situation for the SOL price. The bulls need to defend the $12.82 level at all costs to prevent a fall to the December 2022 low at $8.02. To the upside, the $16.00 level is the key resistance for now. With an RSI of 26.2, SOL is in oversold territory and could initiate a recovery.

As the downtrend persists, new lower lows and lower highs have solidified the notion of an established downward trajectory for this peculiar meme coin. In the latest turn of events, the price of PEPE recently breached yet another local support level, dropping below $0.00000096. With this significant breach, an ominous question arises: Is the frog-themed token headed for further downfall or could there be a potential reversal in store for this once-popular coin. Pepecoin Price Takes A Beating As Social Volume Declines Pepecoin (PEPE) has undergone a substantial price decline, as evidenced by data provided by CoinGecko, which indicates a decrease of 4.9% within the past 24 hours. Moreover, PEPE has witnessed a significant slump of 25.7% over the course of the last seven days, further emphasizing the cryptocurrency’s continued downward trajectory. Source: Coingecko Despite the disappointing state of PEPE’s value, its social volume has remained relatively high throughout the previous week. However, this metric has reached its lowest point at the time of writing, marking a trend that began on June 8.

Traditionally, network growth serves as a metric to monitor the number of new addresses adopting a token. Related Reading: Bleak Dogecoin (DOGE) Social Sentiment Raises Questions About Price Reversal As of June 10, the network growth indicator was recorded at 287, signaling a notable decrease. This decline suggests that PEPE’s previous effective strategy for gaining popularity has lost its effectiveness. The recent development in the PEPE market reveals a rather modest increase in the number of holders, with approximately 7,000 new individuals joining the ranks. Although this figure may seem relatively small in the grand scheme of things, it does provide a glimmer of positivity for the short-term price outlook of PEPE. Crypto total market cap currently at $1.01 trillion on the daily chart at TradingView.com The addition of these new holders suggests that there is a certain level of interest or confidence in the market, which could be influenced by various factors such as positive news developments or favorable market sentiment. However, it’s important to note that the impact of these new holders on the price of PEPE may not be substantial on its own, as other market dynamics and external factors will also come into play. Uncertain Outlook For PEPE Amidst Challenging Market Conditions Looking ahead, Pepecoin faces an uphill battle in revitalizing its fortunes. The figures below show that the coin has been soaked in red since the last month, a sign that more pain could be on the horizon.

SOL rose 2.2%, ADA was up 3.5%, while MATIC surged 5.5%, data from CoinGecko shows. Futures data showed relatively low open interest and liquidations, suggesting the move was led by spot trading.  The development foundations of these tokens separately released statements in the past few days that hit back on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allegations, likely boosting investor confidence.  Solana Foundation said on Thursday that it did not consider SOL to be a security, with some developers stating they did not expect development atop the Solana network to decline in the coming weeks. Elsewhere on Friday, Cardano developer IOG said the SEC's lawsuit contained “numerous factual inaccuracies,” and that “under no circumstances was ADA a security.”  On Sunday, Polygon Labs said MATIC was “developed outside the U.S., deployed outside the U.S.,” and “available to a wide group of persons, but only with actions that did not target the US at any time.”  Earlier last week, the SEC accused crypto exchanges Binance of Coinbase of multiple charges, such as offering unlicensed securities to U.S. investors, and named alleged tokens to be securities.  These tokens were issued by foundations and companies or tied to several protocols. Sandbox (SAND), Filecoin (FIL), Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Flow (FLOW), Internet Computer (ICP), Near (NEAR), Voyager (VGX), Dash (DASH) and Nexo (NEXO) were named as securities.

The price is now trading below $250 and the 100-day simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $280 on the daily chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could accelerate further lower if it breaks the $220 support zone. BNB Price Continues To Bleed In the past few days, BNB price saw a major decline from well above $280 against the US Dollar. The recent SEC lawsuit against Binance is not helping BNB. It is also putting bearish pressure on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The last major high was formed near $352 before the price declined heavily. There was a clear move below the $280 and $250 levels. The decline was such that the price tested the key $220 support zone. BNB price is now trading below $250 and the 100-day simple moving average. A low is formed near $221.2 and the price is now consolidating losses. On the upside, BNB is facing resistance near the $240 level. The first major resistance is near $250. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $352 swing high to the $221 low. Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near $270. The main resistance is now near $280 or the trend line or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $352 swing high to the $221 low. A clear move above the $280 resistance might start a steady increase. The next major resistance is near the $300 level, above which the price might rise toward the $325 resistance. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $250 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $220 level. The next major support is near the $200 level. If there is a downside break below the $200 support, there could be an extended decline toward the $180 support. Any more losses could send the price toward the $164 support.

U.S. regulators are on a warpath, going after major crypto exchanges and declaring a handful of major altcoins as securities – a scarlet letter in crypto terms.  But the crypto market is proving resilient.  Bitcoin is opening the Asia trading week up 0.4% to $25,912, while ether is slightly down to $1,748.  “The liquidity situation has worsened considerably. This is exacerbated by the departure of institutional investors from the market, particularly US-based market makers, who anticipate potential scrutiny from the SEC,” said Johnny Teng, Senior Researcher at LBank Labs, in a note to CoinDesk. “While the S&P 500 continues to achieve new monthly highs, the crypto market remains troublesome.”  Teng says that bitcoin's performance remains robust amidst minimal selling interest in both bitcoin and ether. Notable factors, such as interest rates, stablecoin outflow trends, policy-related news in the US, China, and Europe, and cryptocurrency sector developments are under close observation by Teng's team to see what finally moves the needle.  In a note to CoinDesk, BitBull Capital’s Joe DiPasquale pointed to bitcoin’s support at $25K as still holding up “reasonably well”, but the upcoming release of new Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes could change that.  “Moving forward, market participants will do well to keep an eye on indications from regulators and decisions taken by Binance, Coinbase, and other exchanges,” he said.

Sam Bankman-Fried’s former empire had 300 employees but controlled 130 companies when it filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.  All companies have subsidiaries, but companies that have this many subsidiaries are infinitely more complex operations. General Motors, a multinational with dozens of international partnerships and multiple product lines, has 455 subsidiaries for its $156.73 billion in revenue and 167,000 employees.  To be sure, some of FTX’s subsidiaries had a bonafide purpose. It needed to separate its licensed derivative business out from the corporate mothership; some of the major markets it operated in, like Japan, had separate entities because of the nuances of the market.  Others have pointed to Bankman-Fried’s father, Joseph Bankman, as the architect of the FTX leviathan, given that he’s a professor specializing in taxation at Stanford Law.  These days FTX is relatively out of the spotlight as Bankman-Fried’s trial is months away. Now, it’s Binance that’s under the gun as its faces dual cases from the CFTC and SEC.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler told Bloomberg in an interview that there are parallels between FTX and Binance. Both are being accused of comingling, for start.  But deeper than that are the similarities between Binance and FTX’s corporate structures.  As part of recent legal actions against Binance, the SEC listed out the dozens of corporate entities controlled by Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao in a recent court filing. Inca Digital, a crypto forensics company, recently published a more comprehensive list which shows the web of firms connected to CZ and top Binance associates.  Certainly, there are legitimate uses for such a long list of companies. But the parallels between FTX and Binance that SEC Chair Gensler alluded to continue with their corporate structures.  CZ, for instance, often uses his personal name and personal accounts in Binance company operations, noted Inca Digital. The SEC also noted this in its complaint against Zhao (though Binance has denied any wrongdoing) as part of its accusations of comingling.  Consider this a plea for a more simplistic corporate structure for crypto companies.  FTX’s restructuring team is charging tens of millions of dollars a month as they spend countless manhours picking apart its corporate web.
