42400200,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcItDR,1500582516,Bitcoin Price Surges to One-Month High as Tech Outlook Improves,"After dropping to a low of $1,836 this weekend, the bitcoin price is once again climbing back toward all-time highs.  According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the price of bitcoin rebounded to $2,730 today, the highest value observed on the BPI since June 23 and just $300 off its all-time high of $3,025, set on June 11.  So, what's driving traders?  Overall, analysts are reporting that the recovery is largely due to the improving outlook for bitcoin's technology roadmap, spurred by the expected 'lock in' of a code upgrade called BIP 91 today.  The piece of code that will set the stage for the first part of the Segwit2x scaling proposal, BIP 91 could upgrade the bitcoin blockchain to support Segregated Witness (SegWit), thereby increasing the network's transaction capacity.  At time of publication, miners need to continue to signal for BIP 91 for roughly 20 additional blocks in order to lock in the upgrade. At this point, BIP 91 will enter a ""grace period"" of 336 blocks, before activation.  Complexities escalate from there, as it remains possible SegWit might not be activated under certain scenarios owing to how miners might run the code.  Speculator's delight  Still, the positive sentiment offered a break from the doom and gloom of the debate that has shrouded the market for weeks.  With bitcoin rising, prices were up similarly across the cryptocurrency markets, with all of the top 30 by market capitalization posting gains today. But as traders have a long history of positioning investments in relation to bitcoin scaling proposals, the run-up in price was perhaps not surprising to many.  Iqbal Gandham, managing director at social trading firm eToro, noted that much of the activity is likely due to positive sentiment.  He also noted how it might be somewhat divorced from any strong conviction of what might or might not occur.  ""Segwit, block size increases and the various mechanisms by which to deliver this have been difficult to understand for traders, and they are at the point where they just want clarity and a clear direction,"" he said. ""We may now have one.""  In this way, Kevin Zhou, a trader and market analyst with crypto trading fund Galois Capital, credited the advancement of BIP 91 with the run-up in price.  In particular, he said, traders are responding to the decreasing likelihood that bitcoin could split into two competing assets (though this is still possible later this year), and the increase in capacity SegWit would bring.  ""It's not just reduced uncertainty over whether there will be a chain split, but also less uncertainty over how exchanges will handle a chain split and the issues that come with it (e.g. replay attacks, reorg risk, margin positions, etc.),"" he said.  Split spectre remains  Still, while less possible, tensions in the scaling debate could simply go into hibernation, only to reemerge later this year.  With major miners threatening to fork off onto a separate blockchain should the block size not be raised, it remains possible this debate will lie dormant until fall, at which point, tensions could reemerge.  Under the Segwit2x proposal, a large group of startups and miners agreed to a 2 MB hard fork that would occur three months after Segwit is enacted.  Developers have largely sought to downplay the idea as risky and dangerous.  How aware the market is of this reality remains to be seen, though some sought to stress the short-term positivity and its impact.  ""We still have to worry about whether the market will accept the '2x' half of Segwit2x, but at least there likely won't be an initial split for the SegWit half,"" Zhou remarked.  Likewise, Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin leveraged trading firm BitMEX, went so far as to predict bitcoin could once again test all-time highs should the network enact SegWit in the coming days.  ""The reason why we didn't surpass $3,000 earlier this summer was the specter of UASF [and a bitcoin split]. With that roadblock removed and Segwit activated, money will pour into the system,"" he said.  Hayes concluded:  ""Those who sat on the sidelines due to reservations about how bitcoin would scale now will rush back in with a vengeance.""

42400180,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIsuk,1500578426,Garza Pleads Guilty: GAW Miners CEO Cops to $9 Million Fraud,"Controversial cryptocurrency executive Josh Garza has pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.  As reported by CoinDesk earlier this week, Garza was rumored to have been preparing the plea, one for charges that stem from his operation of four cryptocurrency companies, GAW, GAW Miners, ZenMiner and ZenCloud, all of which were long suspected of fraudulent activities.  In total, the loss attributed to Garza's fraud was estimated at $9,182,000. He is now set to be sentenced on October 12, at which time he will face up to 20 years in prison.  Still, that isn't likely to be the last of the case against the executive, one known for attending conferences with body guards and other bizarre stunts that set off community alarm.  A separate case against Garza for securities fraud, brought by the SEC, is still ongoing, with the agency still gathering evidence until this August. That case could still be settled out of court.  But while unrelated, today's filing touched on the specifics of that case, with the wording singling out the company's sale of mining equipment and describing its operations in a manner similar to a Ponzi scheme.  The U.S. Department of Justice notice, for instance, stressed that Garza's companies defrauded consumers by routinely making false claims about how their products operated, and the state of their business dealings.  Further, it called attention to GAW's hashlet products, a type of virtual mining product that law enforcement officials allege was actually an investment product.  GAW's business collapsed in 2015 and is no longer operational.  https://www.coindesk.com/gaw-miners-paycoin-disappearing-20-floor/  Legal image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/07/20/garza-pleads-guilty-gaw-miners-ceo-cops-to-9-million-fraud,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b45fa472ee5530d081f5a0d82d3c45e976bc7bbe-1500x1009.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As reported by CoinDesk, a total of 153,000 ethers were drained on July 19 due to a security bug in multi-signature wallet software offered by the startup, UK-based Parity Technologies. In a blog post yesterday, Parity went so far as to warn users that the bug was ""critical,"" advising them to take steps to safeguard their funds while the issue was resolved.  However, the stolen funds continue to move. As of press time, 70,000 ethers have exited the hacker's address in seven consecutive transactions, each worth 10,000 ethers.  Data further shows the first transaction (which through two subsequent addresses), successfully cashed out 400 ethers via a cryptocurrency exchange service called Changelly. The price of ether around the transaction time was around $220, making an outflow worth nearly $90,000.  Changelly  subsequently said in a Reddit thread that it has blacklisted the hacker's root address, but that the amount that has already been exchanged is permanently gone. The startup's involvement is also notable, as it provides a service that matches buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies with exchanges, calculating the best rates for the user.  As a result, it does not hold funds or take customer information.  The startup further said the hacker used the Tor network to connect to its service, meaning it was not able to trace the IP addresses or the fiat currencies the funds were exchange for.  ""It's a dead end,"" Changelly posted on Reddit.  So far, the commerce platform Swarm City and smart contract platform æternity, both confirmed the loss of over 120,000 ethers from their ends. A third suspected victim, Edgeless Casino, has yet to offer public comment.

42400186,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIsyg,1500565542,Ripple Reports Uptick in Investor XRP Interest as Sales Triple in Q2,"A new report from distributed ledger startup Ripple suggests institutional investors are increasingly interested in its native cryptocurrency, XRP.  According to the San Francisco startup, its licensed subsidiary sold $31 million worth of XRP during Q2 2017https://ripple.com/insights/q2-2017-xrp-markets-report/. The figure was up threefold from Q1https://ripple.com/insights/q1-2017-xrp-markets-report/, when it recorded $6.7 million in sales.  According to the report, $21 million in such purchases came from institutional investors who actively approached the company through Ripple's licensed money service business. The company sold an additional $10.3 million XRP in a more passive way through sales of the asset to fund its operations.  On public exchanges, Ripple also noted an increasing volume of fiat-for-XRP purchases during the same period, again suggesting an increasingly more mainstream audience.  While bitcoin contributed to 85% of total exchange-traded XRP volume in Q1, this number dropped to 63% by the end of June, according to the company.  As of press time, XRP is trading at $0.17, down from $0.40 on May 17, its most recent all-time high.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

42400189,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIt3b,1500559224,What's an ICO? 'Big 4' Consulting Firms Are Getting the Question,"Clients of the world's four largest professional services firms are expanding their interest in the blockchain sector in line with its recent explosion of experimentation.  According to representatives from Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC, both existing and prospective clients are beginning to ask questions about initial coin offerings (ICOs), the process by which public blockchain technologies can be leveraged to create custom cryptocurrencies that are subsequently sold to fund projects.  With the novel funding method grabbing headlines (and garnering criticism), Eamonn Maguire, who leads KPMG's Digital Ledger Services division, said he has even received requests to work with entrepreneurs seeking to become the next Tezos or EOS, both projects that have raised hundreds of millions by selling cryptographic tokens.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We've seen a definite uptick in the inquiries we are receiving. In the past month alone, we've probably gotten 10 inquires – for example from institutions in France, Switzerland, Russia and Austria.""  And Maguire understands why, adding that he believes the model can bring new investors into the market.  Representatives for Deloitte further indicated that they were receiving increasing interest on the topic, as did EY, which reported starting new conversations with ""wealth and asset managers"" on how they can begin managing cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens.  However, others are pointing to the lack of pertinent regulation as a roadblock that is preventing newcomers from capitalizing on ICOs.  ""While the potential of ICOs in terms of transforming venture capital is indeed exciting for many of our clients around the world, the lack of regulatory clarity, particularly in the US, remains a concern,"" Ajit Tripathi, a director of fintech and digital banking at ‎PwC, said in an email.  Maguire continued this idea, going so far as to state that ICO projects are ""still relatively rare"" owing to an uncertain regulatory environment.  While regulators in some countries, like Australia, have been more vocal about their plans of action, recent reports have criticized lawmakers in the U.S. and U.K.  ""The question becomes what should a responsible ICO address to protect the interests of investors and to build confidence in their solution and controls in the absence of explicit requirements,"" Maguire said, adding:  ""This is at the heart of many of the discussions we are having to date.""

42400179,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIsvj,1500555604,"'Bitcoin Sign Guy' Has a New Job, But He's Keeping His Identity Secret","It's been a tumultuous week since the man known as ""Bitcoin Sign Guy"" held up a pad of paper emblazoned with the words ""Buy Bitcoin"" during a congressional address by US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.  But while details about Bitcoin Sign Guy remain largely shrouded in mystery, a few things appear to be certain. Namely, since drawing international attention to the cryptocurrency, he has apparently received thousands of dollars in bitcoin, become known (perhaps in jest) as one of the most often cited people in bitcoin and, most recently, got himself a new job.  In a blog post yesterday, the non-profit public policy organization, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, revealed Bitcoin Sign Guy was the newest member of its team.  Bitcoin Sign Guy's new boss, former Bitcoin Foundation board member Jim Harper told CoinDesk his latest intern, ""BSG,"" had completed his first day of work, deeming it a success.  But what stands out in Harper's description is the persistent protection his latest hire's identity.  According to Harper, the decision to refer to Bitcoin Sign Guy by his given pseudonym is in line with the ""bitcoin tradition"" that began with the cryptocurrency's creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  Harper wrote in an email:  ""I also wanted to see that he landed well, not suffering serious repercussions for tweaking the powers that be in Congress and the Fed.""  Harper's post described BSG as a recent college graduate working with ""financial technology, bitcoin and the burgeoning variety of cryptocurrencies emerging on the scene to compete with government monopoly money.""  In his email, Harper further described his newest team member's first day at the office as including work with a researcher to explore a ""blue ocean"" study aimed at giving blockchain ""a fully free financial future.""  ""When I got to talking to him,"" wrote Harper, ""I found him a poised young man with sophisticated knowledge of bitcoin, crypto and financial services generally.""  No benefit without risk  Since BSG pulled off the publicity stunt, he's become a bit of a conversational staple, as evidenced by his citation in numerous informal polls.  What remains to be seen, though, is why he needed the job in the first place. A tweet – posted by his ""friend"" as a way to share a bitcoin address and prove that he was the person who held the sign – was later removed, siting concerns about employment.  As for Harper, he appears to have no such concerns.  ""He's a young person with a long life ahead of him,"" he wrote.  ""This event doesn't need to define him in his digital permanent record (creditable though it is).""

42400192,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIt6Y,1500552011,"Non-Profits See Blockchain Vision, But Face Harsh Realities","Although Wall Street pundits and big bank proofs-of-concept often steal the bulk of the attention, they're not the only global groups with an interest in blockchain technology.  In fact, behind the scenes, the world's largest and most influential non-profits and multilateral organizations are turning to blockchain solutions as a way to improve social and economic outcomes in the developing world.  The UN World Food Programme has already implemented pilots to distribute aid to refugees in Jordan; the World Bank launched a Blockchain Lab in June to help develop solutions that can be deployed in its client countries; and the Inter-American Development Bank is working on a digital asset registry designed to help businesses in Latin America more easily access credit.  But while these institutions bring significant resources and institutional muscle into the blockchain arena, they also face unique hurdles to implementation.  Like all organizations, not only must they stay up to date on the latest technologies and bridge the chasm between ideation and finding scalable solutions, but they must do so within risk-averse internal bureaucracies funded by donor-country tax dollars.  These institutions also face a different set of financial incentives than private companies or sovereign governments when it comes to deploying new technologies. This is a key reason blockchain investment in the international development space has lagged behind other sectors.  Despite millions pouring into blockchain and financial technology investment, there remains a ""big gap when it comes to deploying blockchain in social impact and governance"" areas, said Tomicah Tillemann, head of the Bretton Woods II program at New America.  Gabriela Andrade, a financial markets specialist at the IDB in Washington, D.C., put it differently, saying:  ""On paper, it makes sense – the value proposition is clear. The question is, how can we implement it?""  Balancing act  In short, there remains a gap between the two parts of Andrade's question.  The fact is, development professionals face a delicate balancing act between leveraging the latest hip technologies and being realistic about the actual needs of client countries and aid recipients.  ""A lot of the countries that you engage with are poor. They barely have education or electricity, they barely have water,” said Rose Chan, who recently left the World Bank after helping to start an internal blockchain working group.  Chan referenced the advent of mobile payments and banking as an example of a technology solution that outpaced the ability of many of its intended beneficiaries to actually use it.  She told CoinDesk:  ""Even four to five years ago, smartphones were out of reach for poor people, so it's stupid to talk about technology when they are barely putting food on the table.""  Also, the humanitarian nature of multilateral organizations means that there's little margin for error when tinkering with existing systems that may not be perfect but have been refined over the years.  ""Everyone is kind of in the same place in the development community: everyone wants to be on the cutting edge, but they’re making what can be life or death decisions in terms of aid distribution, so they have to get these things right,” said Michael Pisa, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development.  The author of a soon-to-be-released research paper on how development organizations should be approaching blockchain, Pisa highlights the multiplicity of use cases for blockchain as a development tool.  These include how it could be applied to aid disbursement, international payments, digital identity and property rights, but he argues that a premature utilization of the technology could have adverse consequences.  He writes:  ""While this excitement is understandable, it also creates a risk that development organizations embrace and begin to rely on the technology before they fully understand it, which raises concerns about data security and potential financial losses.""  When your only tool is a hammer…  Experts emphasize that development organizations must not fall into the trap of viewing blockchain – or any other technology – as some sort of magical solution to the challenges they face.  After all, there has been no shortage of proposed technological solutions to issues like poverty, humanitarian relief, property rights and financial inclusion over the years – but these problems persist.  There have been ongoing efforts to reach unbanked populations for decades, explained Chan, but 2 billion people worldwide are still without a bank account.  ""The problem isn't going to be entirely solved by blockchain. It's a cool new tool, but it's not a panacea for everything,"" she said.  Because countries sit on different levels of the development continuum and have unique historical and political considerations, blockchain use cases that work well in a certain country may not necessarily work in the next.  Land registries, for instance, have become a popular use case in former Soviet Union countries, but in Latin America there are often significant questions as to who is the rightful owner of the land.  These disputes can date back decades, if not hundreds of years to the colonial era.  ""It won’t solve the problem of land formalization or who owns the land. We need to solve that before we start talking about blockchain,"" said Andrade.  Because Latin America is further up the development ladder than some other regions, use cases like digital identity (that could be game-changing in sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia) don't project to be as impactful.  With this in mind, the IDB is focused more on creating an asset registry designed to tackle the region’s more pressing issues, like improving access to credit and capital for small- and medium-sized businesses.  Chan emphasized that these institutions must remain focused on what they do well and approach blockchain as a means of complementing their current strengths:  ""Our competitive advantage is an understanding of developing countries and markets – we have people in the field, people on the ground. That's our competitive advantage, not developing blockchain software.""  Changing minds  Another major hurdle to using blockchain to improve governance and economic outcomes is generating the political will within target countries that is necessary to do so.  Specifically, the transparency that blockchain offers will be a tough sell in developing countries where regimes are often kleptocratic in nature and the local economies revolve around soliciting favors from the state.  Pisa emphasized that blockchain is, at the end of the day, a technological tool that requires proper implementation to be effectively utilized. He went on to note that various institutions and governments have for decades sought to make aid distribution more transparent through technology.  ""The reasons that that hasn’t happened – that donors haven’t been able to make aid more transparent, that governments haven’t been able to make aid more transparent – I don't think the main reason preventing that from happening is technological,” he said.  Pisa added:  ""[Blockchain] can facilitate doing some of these things, but it still boils down to political willingness.""

42400194,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIt7X,1500548417,Bitcoin Startups Advise Caution as Scaling Proposals Collide,"With a major inflection point for bitcoin just days away, some users are beginning to wonder about the safety of their holdings on major exchanges.  At issue is that several scaling proposals are set to come to a head on or around August 1, and depending on which end up gaining support, there is a risk that bitcoin could split into two competing currencies running on two different blockchains.  In the face of this concern, and the painful lessons learned from past blockchain forks, some exchanges are stepping up to make users aware of possible issues and how they can protect their assets.  Below, we're keeping a running list of major exchanges and their remarks.  Bitfinex  One of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex has yet to issue a blog post on the topic. However, we have some clues to their potential views, because Bitfinex was part of an exchange coalition which sought to address a split in March.  At the time, Bitfinex said it would refrain from halting its operations, and provided context on how it would name each coin.  The firm has not responded to requests for comment as to whether its policy has since changed on the issue.  bitFlyer  At press time, bitFlyer has yet to issue an update on its strategy.  The Japanese exchange was one of the signers of the Segwit2x proposal on May 23.  Bithumb  One of South Korea's largest exchanges, and the victim of a recent hack, Bithumb has yet to issue guidance.  BTCC  China's oldest bitcoin exchange, BTCC is putting its full support behind Segwit2x.  Actively testing the code, the exchange said it's upgrading its exchanges and pool wallets to the new software. It expects to have upgrades complete by July 21, and it will continue signaling support.  ""We hope that the community will reach consensus around this implementation of the bitcoin software,"" the post continued.  Should the network split, BTCC said it will consider the longest chain, which would be the one with the most hashing power, as bitcoin (BTC). BTCC customers that want to move to the minority chain will be given access to their tokens.  The exchange also said it's working to put in place strong ""replay protection"" (aimed to stop bitcoin transacted on one blockchain being broadcast on the other) to protect user funds in the case of a hard fork.  Coinbase (GDAX)  One of the largest and best-funded US exchanges, Coinbase signed the SegWit2x agreement back in May.  While the startup has yet to issue remarks on how its consumer wallets would handle a split, its exchange product, GDAX, was among the first to offer details in a July 13 Medium post.  The exchange sees two possible outcomes, writing:    – One blockchain becomes dominant, resulting in the other blockchain having low community adoption and value.      – Both blockchains are adopted, co-existing and operating independently of one another with roughly equal community adoption and value.    Because of this, the exchange said it may suspend deposits and withdrawals for bitcoin temporarily, and it might also pause trading.  According to the post: ""This decision will be based on our assessment of the technical risks posed by the fork, such as replay attacks and other factors that could create network instability.""  Coinone  The South Korean exchange has issued a blog post on its website mentioning the current scaling war, but it has not disseminated any statement on its policies for a potential split.  Gemini  On July 19, Gemini updated an older blog post on a possible split with new information regarding the scenario.  ""In the event of a hard fork, we will carefully consider our response and how to move forward. We understand that our customers have diverse opinions on this subject, and we will do our best to incorporate your suggestions,"" the blog post said.  It continues to say that, if a hard fork is anticipated, Gemini will suspend deposits and withdrawals.  While the exchange said it was still weighing its options, the current plan is as follows:  ""The 'BTC' balance and trading activity you see on Gemini will likely reflect the chain with the greater total difficulty. We may choose to eventually open new order books for the chain with less total difficulty.""  Huobi  One of China's largest bitcoin exchanges, Huobi said it is preparing for the potential of a bitcoin fork with several policies:    1. Around the potential fork time … the exchange will suspend bitcoin deposits and withdrawals due to potential technical risks such as replay attacks and other issues that may cause network instability.      2. If there is no fork, and the network is stable, we will resume bitcoin deposits and withdrawals.    3. If bitcoin is split into several blockchains, Huobi will give users their rightful ownership of their digital assets. Once the potential bitcoin forks happen, Huobi will take steps to support trading for every type of bitcoin.    4. If you can't be 100% sure [that] your wallet has the function of anti-replay attack, we strongly suggest that you deposit your bitcoin in Huobi, and we will handle all resulting technical issues related to the potential bitcoin forks. If you have bitcoin in your Huobi account, please don’t worry about your asset's safety.    5. Huobi … will support all type[s] of bitcoin after the fork right away. If you need to trade any type of bitcoins, please deposit bitcoin in advance.    Korbit  Another South Korean exchange that supports Segwit2x, Korbit hasn't updated its website or blog.  The exchange responded to requests for comment, but has yet to offer details on its policy regarding a potential split.  OKCoin  OKCoin’s policies, outlined in a July 18 blog post, are similar to Huobi's in that they will suspend bitcoin deposits and withdrawals close to the event. For OKCoin that's from July 31 through August 2.  They advise customers to deposit coins in advance in an effort to not affect their trading. If there is no fork, operations will continue as usual, but, if there is, every blockchain user will be given their rightful ownership of coins, and they will support every type of bitcoin on their trading platform.  Yet, OKCoin lists two further actions it will take:    ""In all these circumstances, the easiest way for uninterrupted trading is for users to deposit bitcoin in advance, and OKCoin will handle all resulting technical issues related to the potential bitcoin forks.      If unexpected events occur during the potential bitcoin fork period, OKCoin may temporarily also suspend bitcoin trading.    If we deem someone has maliciously manipulated the market during this period, OKCoin may take measures including the suspension and roll back of trades.""    Poloniex  The crypto-only trading and lending platform has yet to publish details on its policies leading up to the possible August 1 divergence.  The exchange did, however, comment on concerns in a March blog post on what its policies might be should a split occur, stating any hard fork must have replay protection.  ""Without this, exchanges cannot continuously and properly operate,"" the post said.  Poloniex went on to say it would ""support Bitcoin Core continuously as BTC,"" nodding to the cryptocurrency's open-source developer group, which has roundly rejected the Segwit2x proposal.  Poloniex has not responded to requests for further comment.  Trezor  Hardware wallet provider Trezor said it has received an increasing number of questions regarding potential outcomes of the scaling proposals and the possibility of a split.  In a July 18 blog post, the company acknowledged it is unclear how the network will develop, but assured users that its wallet is the ""safest place"" even for an event such as a bitcoin split.  Xapo  The bitcoin wallet and vault issued a blog post on July 20 explaining what its customers can expect in the event of a bitcoin fork.  Until they can confirm transactions can be done safely, Xapo may temporarily halt outgoing and incoming transfers from the bitcoin network, and may also suspend conversion from dollars and other currencies to bitcoin and vice versa through the Xapo Debit Card.  In the event of a split, the company will support the one with the ""most accumulated difficulty."" Although, the company will give users the choice to withdraw their coins in the secondary blockchain, or let Xapo sell the coins in the secondary blockchain and add the value they receive to the user's account on the supported blockchain.

A specialist in corporate finance and equity valuation, Damodaran is often cited by media as the ""Dean of Valuation"" on Wall Street.  It's against this backdrop that the finance expert recently remarked that cryptocurrencies could eventually replace gold or emerge as an alternative to legal currencies issued by central authorities.  ""If you don't trust paper currency, historically what you've done is you dumped paper currencies [and] you bought gold,"" he said in the interview.  Damodaran told CNBC:  ""Cryptocurrencies have taken the role of gold at least for younger investors, because they don't trust paper currencies.""  As reported by CoinDesk, the price of bitcoin surpassed the value of an ounce of gold for the first time in March, and has steadily traded above this mark for much of the time since.
