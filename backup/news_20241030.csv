35358645,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650730,1730329211,Celestia (TIA) Set For Major Breakout? Top OTC Exec Warns Of Supply Shock,"In an analysis shared on X, Taran Sabharwal, CEO of Stix—a leading OTC trading platform specializing in liquidity solutions for private crypto transactions—provided insights into the upcoming unlock dynamics of the Celestia (TIA) token scheduled for October 31, 2024. His assessment suggests that the market may be underestimating the potential impact on TIA’s price action heading into November. Why Celestia (TIA) Could Be A Buy “TIA – an OTC story,” Sabharwal began. “We used on-chain data (via @celenium_io API) to judge exactly how the unlock dynamics may shape TIA’s PA going into Nov. The results are in the table above. We’ve summarized that a total of 92.3M TIA will be liquid post unlock, which would act as the upper bound of overall spot selling pressure.” Interestingly, this figure accounts for less than 50% of the total cliff unlocks, suggesting that the actual sell pressure may be only half of what the market has been anticipating. Sabharwal highlighted that the real increase in circulating supply compared to the current supply indicates a 41.8% dilution. Related Reading: Celestia (TIA) Leads Crypto Market With 16% Surge, Will It Hit $7 This Month? A significant factor in this dynamic is the activity of OTC buyers who acquired large amounts of the initial unlock and hedged on perpetual futures, causing open interest to surge in recent months. “We expect many of these shorts to continue winding down, partially negating the spot-selling pressure,” he explained. This unwinding could serve as a bullish signal for spot buyers due to the potential reset in funding rates. Sabharwal’s analysis included several key assumptions. OTC round buyers possess an 11 million TIA cliff unlock, included in the non-staked token category since these tokens originated from treasury wallets not tagged on the blockchain explorer. His team mapped a total of 292 vesting wallets but acknowledged some gaps, which were also included in the non-staked category. Reflecting on TIA’s OTC history on Stix, Sabharwal observed that Celestia has been one of the most actively traded assets in the OTC market this cycle. Early in the cycle, it offered an attractive opportunity for directional buyers, while sellers were eager to realize large unrealized profits without expecting an imminent bull market in Q3 2023. He continued: “In Q1 2024, the bull had matured and TIA rallied to $20+. OTC activity was minimal here as sellers didn’t want to take larger discounts (40+%) and buyers didn’t want to bid higher than the $8.5 ceiling. We saw almost no activity as sellers were ‘feeling’ rich and wanted to stay risk-on, despite having the opportunity to realize 100-800x on their investments.” Related Reading: Celestia Plans For 1 GB Blocks For Scaling: Why Are TIA Holders Worried? The dynamics shifted when TIA fell below $5. This was around the time when the Celestia Foundation started raising its OTC round of $100M at $3. “The vesting for buyers was the same as those of private investors—33% unlock on Oct 31 2024 (<2 months from the round) and a 12-month linear unlock,” Sabharwal noted. During the third and fourth quarters of 2024, aggressive OTC trading activity resumed, with sellers offloading various positions. Stix alone facilitated approximately $60 million in TIA volume since July, suggesting that total trading volume could exceed $80 million across all liquidity channels, assuming Stix holds a 75% market share in the OTC space. Summing up his analysis, Sabharwal concluded: “TLDR: Shorts will keep unwinding into the unlock and funding rates may reset to 0 or positive. People who missed the 9th October unstaking deadline may also have unstaked during October, causing further spot supply (ready to be sold) going into November. Either way, the supply shock is massive and it’s been the most broadcasted unlock of this cycle. That, coupled with suppressing OTC discounts, may create a lot of action for the coin.” Renowned crypto analyst Will Clemente also weighed in on the developments via X: “Great piece on $TIA OTC activity by Taran from Stix. TLDR: OTC discount to spot in the private market has compressed over the last year, showing growing demand into the unlock. Stix alone has done $60mm in TIA OTC volume since July.” Clemente added his perspective on the potential market impact: “I think this BTC price action has further slid the probability of Thursday’s TIA unlock being bearish towards ‘no’. 6 months of reaccumulation after 80% drawdown, ton of OTC volume, most widely telegraphed unlock in crypto history, 9 figs short, BTC nearing ATHs. Am long rn.” At press time, TIA traded at $5.00.

Inferring from this outlook, this suggests that the volume trend is pointing towards demand tapering off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Out Of 7-Month Descending Broadening Wedge Pattern For Continuation Above $70,000 The analyst also draws a contrast with last year’s trading activity, specifically from September to November 2023, when Solana’s volume was on the rise. This uptick in trading volume fueled a bullish rally that extended through the first quarter of 2024, with momentum carrying Solana to substantial highs by March. Based on the difference in two time periods and the current decrease in trading volume, the analyst suggested that there is a higher probability of Solana going in a main bearish direction. In light of this, he highlighted a Solana price crash below the $50 price level. Interestingly, a crash below $50 will effectively cancel out the gains in the past year and would return the cryptocurrency to its price range in November 2023. SOL Whales Continue With Activity Solana is still largely in a bullish mode despite the decline in trading volume that was pointed out by AlanSantana. According to data from on-chain tracking firm Lookonchain, crypto whales are have upped their Solana trading activity in the past week, as evidenced by on-chain data. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is About To Complete This Breakout To A Descending Megaphone Pattern, Is $1 Next? In a recent post on social media platform X, Lookonchain highlighted three instances of Solana whale addresses withdrawing SOL tokens from crypto exchanges and staking them. The largest withdrawal came from address “AA21…VxH9,” which moved 153,511 SOL tokens worth approximately $26.4 million from Binance to stake them. Another whale, identified by the address “EHax…gAUa,” withdrew 35,498 SOL tokens valued at $6.12 million from Binance and Kraken over the last three days, also staking the tokens. On the other hand, whale address “EGzi…mR7g” bought 13,000 SOL tokens worth $2.3 million from Binance to bring its total holdings to 95,651 SOL. Interestingly, another smart Solana whale address recently sold 26,726 SOL worth $3.86 million. This whale, known for buying low and selling high, currently holds 42,729 SOL, which are valued at $7.61 million. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $178, up by 8% in seven days. The accumulation and momentum are bullish, and a crash towards $40 seems bleak at the moment.

On Wednesday, the exchange pledged to give crypto super-PAC Fairshake $25 million in 2025 for the following year’s midterm elections.  “The crypto voter is already a force to be reckoned with, but it will continue to grow,” CEO Brian Armstrong said in a X post. The next Congress “will be the most pro-crypto” yet, he asserted, adding, “we’re not slowing down.”  Crypto-industry dollars continue to flood American politics: multiple PACs are spending big on candidates perceived to be favorable to crypto. Fairshake, one of the largest, is also spending against anti-crypto candidates, most notably Katie Porter, who lost her primary bid for a California senate seat.  The pledge brings Coinbase’s total commitments to Fairshake close to $100 million, making it the industry PAC’s single most important funder. Fairshake has raised over $200 million this election cycle.

Analyst Sees Opportunity Despite On-Chain Decline,"The Cardano market (ADA) is now at a crossroads, going through tough times with the cryptocurrency market heating up. Despite the latest $73,000 mark that Bitcoin had attained today, the Cardano trade is losing its way forward, at the current time trading at $0.356. That amounts to 12% of lost value compared to what the coin hit just last month. Today, ADA won a minimal 2.2%, but investors see it failing in comparison with newer coins, which now are rapidly growing in prices. Related Reading: Analyst Eyes $6,000 For Ethereum As Key Support Level Emerges – Details Historical Trends Show Headroom For Further Growth For ADA holders, crypto expert Ali Martinez has some encouraging news. He thinks Cardano might behave in line with its spectacular 2020 expansion. Following a protracted consolidation period, ADA surged by almost 4,000% and peaked at $3.10 within 10 months. I believe #Cardano $ADA is following a similar pattern to 2020. If history repeats, we might see a pump around November 18—about two weeks after the US elections—and a potential market top by September 2025. pic.twitter.com/GgKWBqzYXU — Ali (@ali_charts) October 29, 2024 Martinez thinks if history repeats itself, we may see a price jump starting around November 18, 2024–two weeks after the US elections. As of now, Martinez said ADA has spent 455 days in a range since the last peak, and may hit $6.50 in September 2025 as it is going to skyrocket by 2,288%. ADA market cap currently at $12.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com On-Chain Activity Raises Concerns A fresh analysis from IntoTheBlock that showed Cardano’s Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio has surged to its highest level since June adds to the concern. Often preceding price pullbacks, this statistic points to a decrease in on-chain activity relative to price increases. The report underlined that ADA might struggle to keep increasing pace without more on-chain involvement. Cardano’s NVT ratio has surged to its highest level since June, indicating a decrease in on-chain activity relative to price growth. This classic overvaluation signal is notable given $ADA‘s recent underperformance, suggesting the potential for further downside. Historically,… pic.twitter.com/yTx83exBXM — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) October 29, 2024 Despite these challenges, some analysts are optimistic about Cardano’s long-term horizon. They foresee an estimated 130% growth in the next three months and an impressive 140% increase in the next year. This gap between short-term struggles and long-term optimism would suggest that Cardano has short-term pain ahead but that significant recovery is on the horizon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Potential For Monetary Policy Sparks Growing Interest Among Central Banks The Road To Recovery For Cardano This is a challenging time for Cardano as investors monitor closely its price movement and the behavior of trading with the token. As long as concerns over further dips linger, there are some individuals that believe this is a good opportunity to enter the ADA market before it takes off. Analysts like Ali Martinez offer hope based on previous tendencies despite Cardano’s recent performance. ADA needs the next several weeks to solidify its position in the fast-changing crypto industry. Investors will monitor to see if Cardano can restore market momentum.

Another of the accused firms, CLS Global, said it's trying to start a ""dialogue"" with U.S. authorities.  The U.S. Department of Justice said it secured a guilty plea from the operator of crypto ""market maker"" MyTrade, which was one target in a wide-ranging sting that brought manipulation charges to multiple firms and individuals earlier this month.  Liu Zhou, 39, said to be from China and Canada, will be sentenced early next year in federal court for ""the wash trading of client cryptocurrencies across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges,"" according to the DOJ. Wash trading refers to the artificial driving up of asset prices by suggesting a fake level of transaction interest.  According to federal charging documents unsealed a few weeks ago, Gotbit, CLS Global and ZM Quant were also among those that allegedly wash traded various tokens to make it seem they had more legitimate activity than they actually did, selling some of these tokens at ""artificially inflated prices"" to others.  Read More: It Takes a Fake Token to Catch a Volume Faker  The Justice Department said Zhou's operation, commonly known as MyTrade MM, told people it “does self-trades — a buy and a sell in the same second,” and that its volume bot could do “pump and dumps.” Zhou also allegedly said his firm's intent was to locate “other buyers from the community, people you don’t know about or don’t care about,” because the buyers have to be made to lose money to turn a profit on the tokens.  Meanwhile, another of the firms, CLS Global, said it's reached out to U.S. authorities to cooperate.

42373350,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt580A8,1730320930,"U.S. Treasury Advisory Panel Says Tokenization Could Be Big, But May Need Central Control","The Wall Street brain trust behind the U.S. Treasury Department's debt management took a close look at tokenization and found a lot to like.  The advisory committee also examined stablecoins and argued that a token such as Tether's USDT could pose a significant run risk.  The committee produced a report, which also suggested that stablecoins may need to give way to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in tokenization.  The U.S. Treasury Department's panel of Wall Street advisers see the tokenization of U.S. debt and other assets providing some significant potential advances, the group contended in a new report – while also envisioning an inevitable need for the kind of heavy central hand that may rankle the crypto sector.  Cryptocurrencies and the tokenization of U.S. Treasuries were treated with increased seriousness in the digital-assets views issued by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee on Wednesday. That group of private-sector financial executives from big-named firms such as Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is assigned with helping guide the department's debt management, and it shared thoughts on tokenization and stablecoins — including a warning about risks from Tether.  ""Tokenization has the potential to unlock the benefits of programmable, interoperable ledgers  to a wider array of legacy financial assets,"" the report suggested, especially highlighting the possibility of instant and transparency settlement and clearing, for ""reducing the risk of settlement failure.""  ""Even small incremental improvements in a very large market like the Treasuries market can be impactful at scale,"" the report noted, though it also suggested caution and the likely need for the ""development of a privately controlled and permissioned blockchain managed by one or more trusted private or public authorities.""  ""The way forward should involve a cautious approach spearheaded by a trusted central authority, with widespread buy-in from private sector participants,"" it concluded.  The report also delved into the rise of stablecoins, which have ""increasingly elected to hold significant short-dated U.S. Treasury collateral"" — a situation that will probably be further encouraged by future regulations. It also included a thought on the stability hazard from tokens such as Tether's {{USDT}}.  ""A collapse of a major stablecoin like Tether could result in a 'fire-sale' of their U.S. Treasuries holdings,"" the report said. ""If history serves as any guide, stablecoins will need to be regulated like narrow banks or money market funds to prevent contagion of stress in stablecoin markets to broader financial markets and the Treasury market.""  Read More: Tether's Paolo Ardoino: 'If the U.S. Government Wanted to Kill Us, They Can Press a Button'  When it comes to stablecoins underpinning tokenized transactions, the advisers suggested that ""central bank digital currencies (CBDC) will likely need to replace stablecoins as the primary form of digital currency.""  Any potential CBDC issued by the Federal Reserve would be managed by private-sector banks, Fed officials have said, meaning some of the institutions represented in the advisory group. However, the political chances for U.S. CBDCs, which are strongly opposed by Republican lawmakers, remain dicey in the near term.  Overall, the voices of traditional finance behind the report saw tokenization in all kinds of markets for real-world assets ""promises to unleash new economic arrangements,"" though doing it for short-term Treasuries could ""potentially disrupt the banking system,"" according to the committee, because it could become a rival for bank deposits.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/30/us-treasury-advisory-panel-says-tokenization-could-be-big-but-may-need-central-control,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8be811169a9a696a569f53ea4b323843a69fdd33-4030x2267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

US spot ETFs see a surge in inflows, potentially linked to the upcoming US election and perceived pro-crypto stance of Donald Trump. Despite the pullback, bullish pressure remains, with the possibility of Bitcoin reaching new highs if inflows continue. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin prices have finally broken above the$70k handle this week, the first time the world's largest cryptocurrency is trading above the $70k handle since July. Over the last 7 days, BTC/USD rose 8% in 7 days before taking a breather today and trading down 1% at the time of writing. OTC Inflows Decline Help Bitcoin Rally A notable aspect of the recent rise in bitcoin is that OTC desks, where two parties can trade directly and privately, now have 416,000 BTC (worth $30 billion). This is much higher than the average of less than 200,000 BTC they held during the first quarter, based on CryptoQuant data. OTC desks are mainly used by big companies or wealthy people who don’t want their trades to show up on public crypto exchange records. This lets them buy or sell large amounts without changing the market price. More trades going to OTC desks is one reason why bitcoin’s price has stayed mostly flat for the last seven months. With an abundance of bitcoin on OTC desks, the U.S. spot-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could make purchases without affecting the spot price. Source: Coindesk The amount of bitcoin going into OTC desks each day has dropped to the lowest this year. According to CryptoQuant, in October, OTC desks handled about 90,000 bitcoin daily, which is 52% less than in the first three quarters of the year. This could in part be responsible for the break of the $70k handle. ETF Flows Surge ETF flows returned to the offensive recently and continue to surge as the US election draws nearer. Markets have already declared Donald Trump as the pro crypto candidate, which could also explain the recent price surge. Betting markets have Trump in a sizable lead, while the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll paints a much closer race with Kamala Harris holding a slender lead. Since October 11, spot bitcoin ETFs have taken in nearly $4 billion, with just one day seeing money leave, based on Farside Investors’ data. On Monday, US spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) received $427.60 million, continuing a streak of four days where more money came in. Yesterday saw even more money flow into ETFs, with total inflows of $827 million. The drop in price today could just be a blip, with another positive day of inflows, market participants would hope that a fresh high may be incoming. Source: Coinglass Technical Analysis BTC/USD Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently experiencing a brief pullback hovering on and around a key area at 72000. As the daily candle stands now, a close inside yesterday’s daily candle seems likely, which would result in an inside bar bearish candlestick pattern. This is obviously no guarantee of further downside as it appears that there is still a lot of bullish pressure. However, a retest of the trendline break or the 70000 handle cannot be ruled out. The confluence area between the 70000 and 68334 could be key for the bullish run to continue and may be worth keeping an eye open. Immediate resistance rests at 73777 which is the current ATH with 75000 the next area of interest. Conversely, support rests at 70000, 68334 before the 65876 handle becomes the area of focus.

42373360,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt580H8,1730319797,Coinbase Shares Slump After Big Q3 Earnings Miss on 'Softer' Market Condition,"Coinbase (COIN) third-quarter earnings and revenue missed Wall Street analysts' estimates on Wednesday, sending shares slumping in after hours trading.  The crypto exchange said its third-quarter total revenue was $1.2 billion versus the average estimate of $1.26 billion, according to FactSet data. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $0.28 missed analyst expectations of $0.45. Coinbase's third-quarter adjusted Ebitda of $449 million also missed estimate of $469.2 million.  The crypto exchange primarily suffered from weaker market conditions, the firm said in a shareholder letter, noting that it saw growth in some areas.  “Really solid results across the board, I think quarter to quarter, you definitely see volatility playing a role in trading revenues and we saw that play out with softer market conditions in Q3 but we’re overall happy with the results,” Anil Gupta, vice president of investor relations, told CoinDesk.  The company also said that it authorized up to $1 billion share buyback in October. The repurchase doesn't have any expiry date and the firm will purchase shares depending on the market conditions.  ""We grew our balance sheet by over $400 million that's put us in a position to issue this new share buyback program,"" Gupta said. The company ended the third quarter with $8.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and USDC.  Coinbase’s main source of income is transaction fees, which fell 27% from the second quarter as trading volume across U.S.-based exchanges slipped further. ""Crypto asset volatility — a key driver of trading volume — declined approximately 5% when comparing the Q3 average with the Q2 average,"" the company said in the letter.  Shares of the exchange slumped nearly 7% in the minutes following the report. Year-to-date, the stock rose about 22% amid broader bullish sentiment in digital assets.  Despite continued regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., the company has launched several new projects this year, including most recently a feature that lets Visa debit card holders transfer funds to their Coinbase accounts nearly instantly.  In an effort to diversify its revenue and avoid solely relying on high trading volume, the exchange has also made it a point to build out its other ventures, including its custody offerings and participation in the tokenization of real-world assets.

42373344,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt58048,1730319219,FTX's Nishad Singh Gets No Prison Time for Role in Crypto Exchange Collapse,"NEW YORK – Nishad Singh, former director of engineering at FTX and a one-time member of Sam Bankman-Fried’s inner circle, was sentenced to time served by a federal judge on Wednesday, meaning he's not going to prison like his former colleagues.  He was also ordered to pay $11 billion in restitution.  Singh, 29, who pleaded guilty to six criminal counts including wire fraud and conspiracy in February, is the fourth FTX executive to be sentenced for his role in the fraud. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March for his role as ringleader. Former FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame, who did not testify against Bankman-Fried, recently began serving his 7.5 year prison sentence. And Caroline Ellison, former Alameda Research CEO and one-time girlfriend of Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to two years by the same judge, District Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York (SDNY), last month – her sentence heavily discounted by her prompt and extensive cooperation with prosecutors.  Though Kaplan sounded sympathetic to Ellison during her sentencing last month, he contrasted her long-time involvement in and awareness of Bankman-Fried's fraud with Singh, who was out of the loop until only two months before the exchange collapsed.  ""Your case is not the case that Miss Ellison's was. She was involved from the beginning. She knew for years,"" Kaplan said before handing down the sentence.  Kaplan and prosecutors highlighted Singh's extensive cooperation with prosecutors, during which he incriminated himself repeatedly and informed the government of crimes they did not yet know about.  While Singh did promptly cooperate with the prosecution after FTX collapsed – as well as the FTX bankruptcy estate, as highlighted in an Oct. 29 letter from current FTX CEO John J. Ray III to the court – including testifying against his childhood-friend in Bankman-Fried’s trial last October, he admitted he knew of the $8 billion hole in FTX’s balance sheet by September 2022, two months before the exchange collapsed. Despite knowing about the disastrous financial situation at FTX, Singh also went through with the purchase of a $3.7 million estate in Washington's Orcas Island in October of 2022, which his lawyer, Andrew Goldstein of Cooley LLP, described as a ""deep mistake.""  Wednesday's sentence was surely welcome news to Singh and his legal team, who requested that the former FTX executive serve no prison time. In a court filing earlier this month, Singh’s lawyers urged the court to consider his “limited” involvement in the scheme, as well as his cooperation with the prosecutions of Bankman-Fried and Salame. The filing described him as an “uncommonly selfless individual” and attached more than 100 letters from friends and family.  More than 20 friends and family members – including Singh's fiancee Claire Watanabe, his parents and his younger brother – attended the sentencing on Wednesday. Watanabe gasped with relief at the news that Singh would not be going to prison. Both parents shed tears.  Before Kaplan dismissed the court, he spoke to Singh's parents, emphasizing that he was speaking from his personal perspective and not as a judge.  ""I don't see anything you did wrong,"" Kaplan said.

35349432,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650718,1730318432,Can SUI Reach $2.18? Bullish Pressure Builds Toward Key Milestone,"SUI is gathering bullish steam as it heads toward a possible breakout, with a notable milestone of $2.1825 in sight. Recent market activity suggests an upswing could be on the horizon, following a strong rebound at the $1.5 support mark. If the bulls maintain their momentum, SUI’s path might lead to a significant price advancement, signaling a promising opportunity for traders and investors alike. However, the question remains; will the pressure be enough to push past this critical resistance? This analysis aims to examine SUI’s current bullish momentum and assess whether rising pressure could drive the price to a potential target of $2.1825. By analyzing recent price movements, support levels, and resistance zones, this piece seeks to provide traders and investors with insights into SUI’s capacity for a breakout SUI Bullish Surge Aims At $2.1825 Mark Following its recovery at $1.5, SUI’s price on the 4-hour chart has continued to build pressure, approaching the $2.18 mark with a focus on breaking past it. SUI has also moved above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), signaling a strengthening upward trend that could pave the way for a potential breakout. The 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator shows bullish signs for SUI, with its SMA and signal lines rising above the zero line, indicating a growing positive trend. In addition, the widening spread between these lines implies strong support for a sustained uptrend, reflecting increased buying interest as the asset approaches key resistance levels. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $2.50 Target For SUI Following 30% Weekly Gain – Details Also, on the daily chart, SUI has demonstrated firm upward momentum, marked by a bullish candlestick pattern after a successful rebound at $1.5. Currently trading above the 100-day SMA, SUI’s position not only confirms an optimistic phase but also suggests that previous resistance levels may now act as support, creating a solid foundation for future gains. Finally, a detailed analysis of the Composite Trend Oscillator formation on the 1-day chart reveals fresh bullish movement for SUI. The indicator’s signal line is aiming to cross above the SMA line, a classic key indication suggesting robust buying interest. Positioned above the zero line, this crossover attempt indicates that positive sentiment is likely building, with the potential to drive prices more on the upside. Support And Resistance Levels To Watch On the upside, resistance around $2.18 presents the next hurdle for SUI. Successfully breaking above this level could pave the way for higher targets, including its all-time high of $2.36. A breach of this resistance would significantly increase the possibility of reaching new price milestones. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Bullish Breakout As Crypto Traders Go Long Above $2 – What’s Next? However, if the cryptocurrency fails to surpass the $2.18 resistance level, it may initiate a downward move toward $1.5. Should it break below this support, the decline could extend further to the $1.42 support level and beyond.

35347723,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650793,1730316435,How Trump’s DOGE Vision Could Impact Bitcoin Prices By 2025: Market Expert Answers,"As the US presidential election approaches, former President Donald Trump’s odds on crypto betting platforms like Polymarket have surged, with analysts predicting significant implications for Bitcoin prices if he secures a second term in the Oval Office. However, market expert Patrick H. warns that the current favorable conditions supporting Bitcoin’s rally toward a new record high may shift dramatically under Trump’s proposed fiscal policies for the coming year. ‘No Money Printing, No Gains’ In a recent analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), Patrick H. posited that if Trump is re-elected and appoints Elon Musk as the head of the newly proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the era of aggressive money printing could come to an end. During a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, the Tesla CEO revealed plans for the DOGE initiative, suggesting it could reduce federal spending by at least $2 trillion. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support To Set A $6,000 Target – Analyst Patrick H. argues that without continued money printing, there may be limited upward movement in Bitcoin prices. “No money printing, no price going up,” he stated. The expert believes that the market may not be fully accounting for the ramifications of a Trump victory on both the cryptocurrency and stock market outlook for 2025. Additionally, Patrick raised alarms about the Bank of Japan’s concerns regarding the US stock market if Trump implements these proposed policies. He warned that such changes could lead to an “economic shock” in 2025, further complicating the landscape for crypto prices. The Bitcoin Rally And The Potential Impact For Altcoins Delving into the current price dynamics, market analyst Miles Deutscher recently said that despite Bitcoin trading just below its all-time highs, the market feels “unusually quiet,” attributing the silence to a lack of retail investor participation, which he argues is crucial for driving momentum in the cryptocurrency market. Deutscher pointed out that from October 2023 to March 2024, altcoins experienced significant rallies, with many rising four to five times from their lows. Coins in trending sectors, particularly those related to artificial intelligence and meme coins, even saw increases of 10 to 15 times during this period. However, the analyst highlights that it wasn’t until February that retail interest re-emerged, as evidenced by metrics like Google Trends, app store rankings, and YouTube views. Deutscher believes that this delay in retail engagement raises an important point: substantial price movements in cryptocurrencies often occur without immediate retail participation. According to the analyst, the Pareto Principle applies here—80% of gains typically occur during the final 20% of a price movement. This means that retail investors tend to wait until significant upward momentum is already established before entering the market, suggesting further price gains in the months ahead. Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline In the current context, the recent altcoin rally has only lasted four weeks following a six-month downtrend. Deutscher recalls that in the previous cycle, it took five months for retail investors to notice the market’s recovery. The analyst predicts a similar pattern may unfold again, although he asserts that the trust built during the March rally could shorten the time frame for renewed retail interest. Still, Deutscher emphasizes that Bitcoin breaking through its all-time highs would serve as powerful marketing for the entire cryptocurrency space. Ultimately, the analysts explains that the resulting “wealth effect” from the current Bitcoin rally is likely to catalyze further increases in altcoin prices, creating a positive ripple effect throughout the market. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has managed to regain the $72,000 level after a brief correction to $71,400 in the past 24 hours.

42373363,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt580K8,1730315711,"The Protocol: Crypto Fundraising, Job Losses, Juicy Payouts, Grants for Devs","In an industry where the whole point is to revolutionize the business of money, the hunt for actual money is quite real. Sometimes it comes in tokens, sometimes in cash; when teams run out of money, jobs are lost. When projects hit a stride, developers reap windfalls – though not always. We've got all sorts of money stories this week – from a report on funding for Bitcoin Core developers, to the Optimism Foundation's $42.5 million grant to crypto exchange Kraken (a scoop!), to the Stratos report on crypto venture capital firms. I almost decided to call this, ""The Money issue,"" or something like that. But it all just sort of happened organically, so here you go.  OTHER HIGHLIGHTS:  Polymarket is a huge success for Polygon – just not the fees. (Spoiler alert: That's the whole point.)  Kraken's decision to build its new layer-2 network on the OP Stack came with a juicy grant from the Optimism Foundation.  Layoffs hit Consensys and dYdX.  Profile of Sovryn founder Edan Yago.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Nil, Stacks, Space and Time, BOB, Optimism, Theta.  Nearly $60M of blockchain project fundraisings.  CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds reports from Hong Kong – on Chainlink's new big thing, and Animoca's new big office.  Network News  Cumulative gas fees Polymarket on Polygon PoS in 2024 have totaled just over $27,000 this year, through Oct. 23. (Token Terminal)  POLYCONOMY: Polymarket – the decentralized predictions market – has been a massive success for the Polygon blockchain team. The betting app has been organically breaking out, getting mainstream usage and attention – speculation on presidential elections! And the Satoshi HBO documentary! But according to data, Polymarket has only brought in a meager $27,000 in fees on Polygon’s PoS blockchain in 2024, CoinDesk's Margaux Nijkerk reported in her incredibly smart and surprising dive into the topic. How is this possible? Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron agreed that $27,000 is a low figure, but he told Nijkerk that the dynamic illustrates just how cheap it is to use the blockchain – a selling point. The fee for a transaction on Polygon PoS is about $0.007, easily below the sub-cent threshold that several teams have targeted. Boiron arguest that apps like Polymarket aren’t expected to bring in large revenues in transaction fees, as one might expect from more transaction-intensive applications like decentralized crypto exchanges. “The question is, like, Why is Polymarket so interesting if they are only bringing $20K?"" Boiron told CoinDesk. ""The obvious reason is just, let's call it attention.” The success shows that “you can have an amazingly successful app on Polygon PoS that, like you can, you hardly even know that you're using a blockchain,” Boiron said.  BOUGHT DEAL? It was big enough news last week when the U.S. crypto exchange Kraken announced that it is launching its own layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain, based on technology borrowed from Optimism – the same provider that powers rival Coinbase's layer-2 network, Base. Ink, as Kraken's new network is known, is being built on the OP stack, a customizable toolkit that lets developers create their own blockchains using Optimism’s technology. The network is expected to go live in early 2025. (CoinDesk broke the news about a year ago that Kraken was considering following Coinbase into the layer-2 space.) The immediate takeaway was that Optimism and its ""Superchain"" appear to be winning the layer-2 race versus competitors like Arbitrum and Polygon. But as these things go, sometimes it takes a little extra time for the full story to dribble out. CoinDesk's Margaux Nijkerk, after some hard-nosed reporting, extracted the crucial detail that the Optimism Foundation paid Kraken a grant of some 25 million OP tokens (worth $42.5 million at the current price) to build on OP Stack. Lest this lead to head-scratching — don't customers usually pay suppliers? — what is actually happening here is that the foundation is using its considerable warchest of spare tokens to encourage new networks to join the Superchain, and subsidize their development – with the ultimate goal of reaching critical mass (and potentially an insurmountable lead). The foundation's chief growth officer, Ryan Wyatt, posted on X (after the story ran) that the ""Collective is not going to stop investing in developers.""  LAYOFFS! Consensys, one of the main supporters of the Ethereum network, announced plans on Tuesday to lay off 20% of its workforce, blaming broader macroeconomic conditions and ongoing regulatory uncertainty, including the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) “abuse of power” in the space. Later in the day, the news emerged that, dYdx, the company building an on-chain crypto derivatives exchange, had fired 35% of its core team. The shake up adds more turbulence to dYdx's 2024 staffing woes, which had already seen CEO Antonio Juliano step down from the leadership post, only to return in early October.  ELSEWHERE:  DWF Labs, a crypto trading firm, said it fired one of its partners following social media allegations that one of its employees had spiked a woman's drink at a Hong Kong bar.  In a press release, the company said it dismissed a partner from ""management and operational roles effective immediately"" and called the allegations ""deeply concerning."" The company, which said it's investigating the matter, did not name the partner.  U.S. President Joe Biden called Bola Tinubu, the president of Nigeria, on Tuesday to personally thank him for the recent release of detained American Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan. Gambaryan, head of financial crime compliance at Binance, was released on humanitarian grounds last week, eight months after he was first taken into Nigerian custody and subsequently charged with money laundering and tax evasion as a proxy for his employer. The charges were later dropped.  JUST IN: Inspired by Trump, Florida Official Eyes State Bitcoin Stockpile for Retirees  ICYMI: From Smuggling Gold Out of Africa to Bridging Bitcoin and Cardano — the story of Sovryn and BitcoinOS founder Edan Yago, a self-described ""bitcoin accelerationist.""  HYPERSPEED: Starknet Claims to Shatter Transaction Speed Record Among Ethereum Layer-2 Networks  From Smuggling Gold Out of Africa to Bridging Bitcoin and Cardano  Edan Yago (Courtesy: BitcoinOS)  From ages 9 to 11, Edan Yago smuggled gold, hidden in his clothes by his mother, out of South Africa.  The apartheid government had instituted capital controls to stabilize the rand amid international sanctions. The authorities were hunting some of his family members whom it had designated as ""terrorists.""  “Eventually, we were forced out of South Africa,” Yago told CoinDesk in an interview.  His family were no strangers to tyranny. Some relatives had survived the Holocaust; others weren't so lucky.  That background, combined with his education in neuroscience and data science, led him to a career working in Bitcoin, with its value proposition of wealth that governments can't easily confiscate and transactions that central authorities can't veto.  “Throughout, my focus has been on trying to develop tools for greater sovereignty,” Yago said.  A self-described ""bitcoin accelerationist,"" Yago is the founder of Sovyrn, a decentralized bitcoin lending and trading platform. He is building BitcoinOS, a ""rollup"" stack for the world's largest cryptocurrency designed to process more transactions and more complex operations like smart contracts than the blockchain could handle otherwise.  CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ARTICLE BY AMITOJ SINGH  Report on Bitcoin Core Funding Highlights Just How Dependent the World's Biggest Blockchain is on Volunteers  The chart illustrates just how much smaller Bitcoin's ecosystem spending is compared with that of the newer blockchain Polkadot – despite a market capitalization that's 82 times bigger. (1A1z)  A pair of researchers from an organization called 1A1z, which describes its focus as ""Bitcoin and freedom technologies,"" published a fascinating report aiming to identify sources of funding for developers working on ""how Bitcoin protocol development is funded in a decentralized project with no funding.""  The report lays out the premise: ""Unlike most successful open source projects, it doesn't have a corporate creator or foundational home. It has a market capitalization of around $1.2 trillion, but unlike most trillion dollar technologies, it has no ability to raise capital. Bitcoin is a commodity, but unlike gold it is running software that needs to be maintained. It has no company, no foundation, no treasury, no employees… no representatives of any kind. And yet it is live, running, production software, securing a large amount of value that needs to be maintained, patched and improved. But those that buy it, hold it, use it, or build on it have no obligation to fund it. It is a public good that suffers from a free rider problem.""  CoinDesk's Protocol Village column has chronicled a few grants to Bitcoin Core developers, specifically from BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes's family office, Maelstrom – here and here. Last week we wrote about the first-ever Bitcoin grant from a donor-advised fund, on the recommendation of a donor through a partnership with Unchained. But it's all pretty sporadic.  Some of the sobering findings from the report, written by Dan O'Prey and Mas Nakachi:  ""Bitcoin currently is actively maintained by around 40 developers, many of them volunteers.""  ""Many of these developers are volunteers; many are sustained not through steady employment but an ad hoc system of short-term grants.""  ""Most could make more money as developer number 20,001 at Meta. But without them, Bitcoin would not be what it is and would not exist a decade from now.""  There are only five ""core maintainers"" for the project – meaning they have the ability to merge code proposed by core developers to the main branch of the Bitcoin Core software. ""This relatively small number of people for such a valuable and monumental project may be quite surprising to many. Upon learning it for the first time, it also was surprising to us, longtime Bitcoiners that have benefited from the work of these developers.""  Arbitrum Foundation Biggest Investor in Crypto Deals <$5M, Stratos Report Shows  The crypto VC firm Stratos published a new report, ""State of Crypto Venture Q3 2024.""

This means the crypto industry should consolidate and get smaller.  Crypto venture firms in aggregate will likely underperform holding BTC by a wide margin.  Of the ~$88B deployed into crypto venture, half of that was invested in the top 4 categories: Finance ($12.6B), Web3 ($12.5B), DeFi ($10.2B), and Gaming ($7.6B).

35346321,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650691,1730314832,"XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline","A crypto analyst has made a bold prediction about the XRP price, highlighting that an explosive rise above $3 is not a matter of if but when. While XRP’s slow price growth over the years has tested the patience of many investors, the analyst is confident that the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals and market dynamics are aligning for a significant upward movement. Timeline For XRP Price Surge Above $3 Popular crypto analyst Javon Marks has expressed optimism about the future outlook of the XRP price, predicting that the prominent cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a significant rally above the $3 mark. In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Tuesday, Marks revealed that the recent XRP price action indicated a “massive bullish breakout” to the upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Out Of 7-Month Descending Broadening Wedge Pattern For Continuation Above $70,000 The analyst suggested that this upward momentum could happen very soon, implying that all the conditions and signs were pointing towards a substantial price shift for XRP in the future. Sharing a detailed chart of XRP’s historical price movements, Marks noted that the cryptocurrency had formed a distinct triangle pattern, starting in 2014 and peaking in 2017. After breaking out of the triangle pattern in 2017, XRP experienced a dramatic price surge, reaching new highs before recording a short dip and then rallying again to its current all-time high of $3.84 in 2018. Based on Mark’s price chart, XRP has formed another similar triangle pattern, which started around 2018 and is projected to peak in 2025. Marks pointed out that breaking out of this triangle pattern could trigger a massive increase in the XRP price, potentially pushing the cryptocurrency to new highs around $3.6 by 2025. Price Remains Stagnant While Other Cryptocurrencies Rally Despite the optimistic price projections for the XRP price, the cryptocurrency has been facing immense downward pressure for the past few months. While other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most meme coins have been experiencing significant price gains amidst the positive shift in market conditions, XRP price has struggled to build momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is About To Complete This Breakout To A Descending Megaphone Pattern, Is $1 Next? Data from CoinMarketCap has revealed that XRP is currently trading at around $0.5, recording significant declines, much to the frustration of long-time XRP holders and investors. While Bitcoin has skyrocketed to $72,000, Ethereum to $2,670, and Shiba Inu to $0.0000188, XRP has declined by 0.37% in the last 24 hours and decreased by 18.61% over the past month. Currently, XRP is being cited as one of the worst-performing assets in the crypto space, as its price has failed to break beyond the $1 mark since February 2022. This bearish price trend and slow momentum could be attributed to XRP’s bearish market sentiment and the ongoing legal battles between Ripple Labs and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Crypto credit markets also saw rising borrowing leading into the election expecting price volatility, Maple Finance co-founder Sidney Powell said.  The U.S. elections coming up next week are anticipated to be a major catalyst for cryptocurrency markets, and institutions are positioning for a spur of volatility in bitcoin {{BTC}} prices, observers told CoinDesk.  Short-term borrowing rates on institutional crypto lending markets have been rising as the November 5 presidential election approaches, Sidney Powell, co-founder of crypto lending venue Maple Finance, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  ""We're seeing more inbound requests for borrowing from some of the larger institutions,"" Powell said. ""Demand for larger-ticket loans and borrowing against open trade credit has increased significantly.""  These players ""are anticipating there might be some volatility to the upside and a run-up in asset prices,"" Powell added.  Those institutions typically include prime brokerage firms and over-the-counter desks, who likely build up inventory to provide margins to other clients and peers, or position themselves to go long with leverage into a potential bull market, he explained.  Positioning on derivatives markets also suggests that institutions are allocating to crypto ahead of the elections.  The options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures market, the favored venue for sophisticated, traditional institutional participants, experienced some of its busiest days recently, said Joshua Lim, co-founder of principal crypto broker Arbelos Markets.

42373345,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt58058,1730313421,Opportunities for Blockchains and Digital Assets to Support and Enhance U.S. National Security,"As national security experts, we invariably view emerging technologies through a lens that focuses on risk, mitigation and safety. We have decades of combined experience in numerous national security roles across the U.S. government, including careers at the FBI, CIA, U.S. Secret Service, and Departments of Justice and Treasury. Our experiences range from establishing the first dedicated digital asset illicit finance investigation unit, to high level roles at the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence, to dismantling transnational organized criminal groups.  The national security edge in the U.S. has been built on an ability to develop and embrace new technologies and we have joined with the Blockchain Innovation Project to share our experiences on how U.S. national security may benefit from certain implementations of blockchain technology. Given that blockchain technology is still in the early stages of its cycle into mainstream uses, policy makers and the public are often confronted with a plethora of inaccurate information, frequently from sources that don’t understand the technology, and occasionally from purposeful efforts to advance a narrative with incomplete facts or misguided analysis.  In its simplest form, a blockchain is a technology utilizing cryptography. Like other technologies, it is agnostic to its use. Currencies, whether fiat or digital, are used to fund both legitimate and illicit activities.  America’s strategic national security interests require policy focus on market structure. Many policy approaches relating to markets and the role of blockchains in them are too broad, trying to simultaneously address multiple issues like market integrity or mitigating systemic risk. The challenges of these broad-scope approaches are compounded by a continued lack of understanding about blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and tokenomics.  We believe wholeheartedly that if the United States proactively creates structures for this technology to flourish onshore, policy makers will quickly see that blockchain and digital assets can be leveraged as tools of strength and democratization, rather than serving only as tools of criminals and rogue international actors, as is often assumed.  Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar remains one of the most powerful tools in the U.S. soft-power arsenal. Establishing a regulatory framework that allows people to access regulated, fully-backed U.S. dollar-based stablecoins issued by the private sector is not only an opportunity for economic growth, but also a path to channel a large portion of the global economy into the U.S. regulatory system, increasing the monetary and regulatory tools at our country’s disposal.  It is also important to recognize that the rest of the world, adversaries and partners alike, are moving forward with the development and adoption of digital assets in their financial systems. Some are doing so at an accelerated pace while many banks in the U.S. rely on software platforms that were installed in the 1980s using code from the 1950s. In a recent interview, the European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has stated, “we envisage a digital euro as a digital form of cash that can be used for all digital payments...” Meaningful regulatory frameworks, many of which protect national security, were established in more than 20 countries in 2023. Conversely, hostile countries continue to exploit regulation gaps and take advantage of the vulnerabilities created by patchwork rules and absent market structures.  As highlighted by the CFTC Technology Advisory Committee, this can contribute to diluting the nation’s’ influence and position as a provider of the global reserve and transaction currency, weakening the ability to combat illicit financial activity.  With regulatory certainty, the national security benefits of digital assets and blockchain technology will grow exponentially. Some of these benefits include strengthening our ongoing efforts to counteract adversarial influences, more effectively monitoring international trade requirements, and enforcing sanctions. Specifically, the use of blockchains and tokenization processes vastly enhances the traceability of supply chains ensuring that our critical resources are free from malign influence. This capability is vital not just for economic security but also for safeguarding technology and defense capabilities from foreign exploitation.  By design, cryptocurrency transactions are immutably recorded to a public ledger. This affords identification and tracing opportunities to investigators and intelligence agencies that do not exist with traditional financial transactions. This goes beyond the individuals directly involved in the transfer of assets and facilitates disruption or judicial action against the entire criminal network, to include supply chains, money mules, affiliates, infrastructure service providers, money launderers and on-ramps and off-ramps to fiat currency.  A common misconception is that blockchain inherently guarantees anonymity. While transactions can be pseudonymous, they are not entirely anonymous. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, which can be analyzed to reveal patterns and links to individuals or entities. Fortunately, blockchain’s transparent nature provides law enforcement with tracking and tracing capabilities to identify the flow of illicit transactions that were previously unavailable in traditional financial crimes Unlike cash transactions, which leave little trace, blockchain transactions allow for tracking of assets across networks. By analyzing transaction patterns and employing forensic blockchain analysis, authorities can trace illicit activities in ways that are not possible with traditional, cash-based methods. This capability is starting to transform approaches to combating financial crime and holding bad actors accountable.  Finally, digital assets also offer additional advantages over cash in terms of freezing or seizing. In just the last year, billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency associated with thefts, hacks, and money laundering have been blocked or frozen following due process of law. Many cryptocurrency issuers support government authorities by working with hundreds of law enforcement and regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Secret Service, and the FBI.  The U.S. has a responsibility to remain at the front-end of technological advancement and uphold strong national security. By collaborating to develop a clear market structure and regulatory framework for blockchain and digital assets, leaders will help fuel forward progress that will protect U.S. citizens and the economy at home and abroad, for decades to come.

35343261,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650707,1730311205,"Ethereum Holds Key Support To Set A $6,000 Target – Analyst","Ethereum (ETH) is showing strength, finding support at a critical level around $2,400 and pushing to local highs near $2,800. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis highlighting Ethereum’s potential to break out. Holding this key level suggests ETH could be on the verge of a significant rally. Martinez’s analysis points to a large trading channel with an upper boundary of around $6,000, indicating a substantial upside if ETH continues to gain momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Fear A Short Squeeze Above $71,000 As Open Interest Rises To $22.6B As the crypto market broadly trends toward new highs, Ethereum’s performance has lagged behind some altcoins. A strong push past $2,700 could build the momentum for Ethereum to attract renewed interest, particularly from institutional and long-term investors. Investors are watching to see if it can finally catch up to the broader market’s gains. Should Ethereum hold its ground and continue upwards, the anticipated surge could solidify its position as a leading asset in the next major crypto rally. Ethereum Accumulation About To End Ethereum has been consolidating since early August. Some analysts see this as a strategic accumulation phase by long-term investors before a potential breakout. Ali Martinez highlights this view in his technical analysis on X, sharing a chart showing Ethereum trading within a channel. According to Martinez, this ongoing consolidation around $2,400 suggests a buildup phase, positioning ETH for a powerful surge if it breaks out of its current range. Martinez points to the critical $2,400 support level as a foundation to propel Ethereum toward the channel’s upper boundary at around $6,000. Such a move, however, would require ETH to first breach the $2,800 level, confirming a shift out of its consolidation phase. If Ethereum’s price closes above this level, the breakout would mark a reversal and signal a new upward trend. This potential rally aligns with broader market trends, as other altcoins and Bitcoin are pushing toward new highs. Analysts believe this could create a domino effect, drawing capital into ETH as investors look for high-upside assets with established use cases and network activity. Related Reading: Cardano Might See A Massive Pump Around November 18 – Analyst Exposes 2020 Similarities If Ethereum can hold above $2,800 and build momentum, the move could validate Martinez’s $6,000 target. Investors are watching as a breakout could signal a phase of exponential growth for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. ETH Testing Critical Supply level Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,680, just 3.5% away from its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,776. This EMA level acts as a significant resistance point, and for bulls to take control, ETH must break above it and then hold this level as support to confirm an uptrend. A push above the $2,820 supply level would further solidify bullish momentum and set the stage for a potential breakout. However, ETH might spend several days trading below these crucial levels before a decisive move unfolds. Market conditions could favor a period of consolidation, allowing ETH to gather more strength and push higher. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst A retrace is likely if ETH fails to hold prices above the 200-day EMA and the $2,820 supply zone. In this scenario, ETH would potentially seek support around lower demand levels, notably near $2,500, where it could stabilize. If ETH holds this support, consolidation within a range could continue. Investors and traders closely watch these levels to gauge ETH’s next direction in this critical phase.

42373347,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt58068,1730308129,Fortune Claims Polymarket Is 'Rife' With Wash Trading,"Prediction market Polymarket is ""rife"" with wash trading, a type of market manipulation that's illegal in traditional finance and involves the identical person acting as both buyer and seller on a given trade, Fortune reported Wednesday, citing analyses by blockchain sleuthing firms.  The Fortune article, which debuted about a week after suspicions of a different kind of manipulation on Polymarket, cited research done by two blockchain analytics firms. One, Chaos Labs, ""concluded that around one-third of trading volume — and overall users — on the presidential market alone was likely wash trading, along with across all markets."" The other, Inca Digital, ""found that a 'significant portion of the volume' on the market could be attributed to potential wash trading,"" the magazine said.  Wash trading is banned in TradFi because it can give a false impression of the untainted demand and pricing for assets.  A Polymarket spokesperson told CoinDesk: ""As the researchers themselves note, a single trader taking positions on both sides of a market is hardly unique to Polymarket and not in and of itself problematic.""  Unlike on Wall Street, the spokesperson went on, ""Polymarket makes all transactions on its platform transparent and publicly available, including to researchers"" and the company's terms of service ""expressly prohibit market manipulation.""  The Fortune article hinted that these alleged wash trades are motivated by something more prosaic than influencing the outcome of next week's U.S. presidential election. It noted that Polymarket is reportedly considering issuing its own token and that wash trading is often done in crypto to become eligible for token giveaways to active users, a practice known as ""airdrop farming.""  In a post on X (formerly Twitter), prominent crypto investor Nic Carter suggested that airdrop farming would be the most plausible driver of any such activity, rather than political shenanigans.  Polymarket does not currently charge trading fees, which would inhibit repeated buying and selling.  Flip Pidot, a veteran prediction market trader who has tracked activity on Polymarket closely, said that without seeing firsthand the research by Chaos Labs and Inca, it would be hard for him to evaluate the Fortune article's central claim.  But he took issue with a secondary claim in the article, which called it an ""anomaly"" that Polymarket counts each trade as $1 in volume, even when a trader paid as little as a cent for a ""yes"" share in Hillary Clinton winning this presidential election.  ""Volume in prediction markets (and indeed futures markets generally) is routinely quoted in terms of notional value (i.e. payout value), which as the article states, is what Poly is doing,"" Pidot told CoinDesk. ""If you buy a $1 payout position for $0.01 (and someone buys the other side at $0.99), that's $1 of notional volume.""  Fortune's claim of wash trading on Polymarket is different than the one that made mainstream headlines a week or so ago. That earlier narrative, which many market experts called dubious, was that a ""whale"" trader was trying to drive up Donald Trump's odds of winning the presidency on the platform, possibly to influence voter turnout or give Trump a pretext to dispute election results if he loses.  While Polymarket has confirmed that a handful of accounts with large bullish positions on Trump are controlled by the same French national, market watchers said the whale's trading patterns suggested they were buying shares strategically rather than trying to inflate the price.

42373352,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt580B8,1730307829,Making Crypto Tokens Useful and Fair,"Let’s be honest: when it comes to launching new tokens, the landscape is pretty rough. We’ve seen the same sad storyline play out repeatedly this year. Projects hype a token with limited or no fundamental utility, distribute a small number to the public at a high valuation, and then watch as the market price crashes toward zero.  Many blame “regulatory uncertainty” for this problematic pattern, arguing that only memecoins can survive the hostility of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and that there’s no way for crypto founders to launch exciting projects – and tokens that may be necessary or supportive of that project — without violating the federal securities laws.  We don’t agree.  We spend a lot of time talking to founders about how to develop a regulatory compliance strategy and prepare for SEC scrutiny when launching new tokens. You might expect two lawyers to address that issue by diving deep into the Howey Test, explaining why a court opinion about apartments in the 1970s means a token isn’t a security, or devising a complex corporate structure that requires a diagram to understand.  So now what is the focus? Something much more important: be a good actor and build tools people want.  We recommend founders start by stepping back from the details of the law and answering two questions: how do you make the token useful, and how do you make it fair?  Make the token useful  What does it mean for a token to be useful? The best heuristic is whether people want to hold it for some reason other than as an investment. For example, some tokens grant access to blockchain-based products or services, similar to how baseball tickets grant access to a game. Other tokens coordinate human decision-making, as with governance tokens, or incentivize human work, as with base layer infrastructure tokens. And even other tokens memorialize contributions to a system, whether it be data or something else valuable (but that isn’t an investment).  There are many useful tokens in crypto, but the archetype is the original: bitcoin. Bitcoin is useful as decentralized money enabling peer-to-peer payments for the world. It is also useful for providing decentralized security for the Bitcoin blockchain — without bitcoin the asset, Bitcoin the network could not exist. That utility is coded directly into the design of the Bitcoin protocol, which incentivizes people to contribute valuable work in the form of mining.  Similarly, decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) tokens have proven particularly useful. DePIN projects use public blockchains to create decentralized networks of hardware operators who contribute resources such as data storage or wireless connectivity. The success of a DePIN project depends on incentivizing operators around the world to participate in the network, and tokens are uniquely suited to achieve that goal. Unlike traditional payment rails — which are slow, expensive, offchain, and gated by geographic borders — tokens can bring operators on-chain efficiently and effectively no matter where they are in the world.  Make the token fair  A major goal of crypto is to build transparent systems that are secure, accessible, and equitable for everyone. Yet, many tokens have been tarnished by “low float, high FDV” mechanics and other issues that give insiders an unfair advantage over the public. Few things will slow the momentum behind a new token faster than treating retail holders worse than insiders or institutions.  What does it mean for a token to be fair? The best measure is the front page test: will you be proud if your project becomes a huge success and all of the behind-the-scenes details are shared on the front page of a major newspaper? If not, you have some work to do.  One of the biggest pitfalls for new tokens is “decentralization theater” — when token creators pretend to build permissionless or community-governed projects in order to foster affinity with the public, but actually maintain control over the project in secret or, equally as bad, gives a disproportionate amount of the tokens to insiders (and not only investors).  Engaging in decentralization theater is not only unfair to token holders who may be deceived about the nature of the asset that they own, but also could be characterized as fraud by regulators or private plaintiffs. Honesty about every single aspect of a project is paramount. One of the most crucial regulatory advancements that could be achieved is an industry standard for disclosures about projects and their related tokens, and we encourage projects to think about how to be painfully transparent with the community.  The “cost of doing business” in this industry is an expectation that regulators will take notice of successful projects and ask questions sooner or later. Founders should be preparing for those conversations on day one by building in good faith and working hard to do what’s right. Focusing on fairness and transparency may not be easy, but will pay extraordinary dividends in the long run.  These considerations will benefit the industry overall from a technical and utility perspective. But this is not the key to unlocking “regulatory compliance” as the industry has come to think about it. Until we have more comprehensive regulation globally, founders still need to hire lawyers to ensure that they don’t violate the law, and the sooner in a project’s life cycle the better. Great lawyers are excellent thought partners in the token design process, and can help founders avoid costly mistakes that take even more time and money to solve down the road.  But starting from the perspective of making tokens useful and fair will be instrumental in helping the industry achieve long-term success.

35340468,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650657,1730307650,"Can Bitcoin Hit $200,000 Only If The Dollar Falls? Bitwise CIO Answers","Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, addressed a pressing question among investors: Does the US dollar need to collapse for Bitcoin to reach a valuation of $200,000 per coin? Hougan’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s ascent to such a price level does not depend on a decline in the US dollar’s value but rather on Bitcoin’s maturation as a store-of-value asset and global economic factors increasing demand for such assets. Bitcoin Can Reach $200,000 Without US Dollar Collapse In a series of posts on the social media platform X, Hougan recounted a conversation with a financial advisor who posed the question over dinner. “Does the US dollar need to collapse for Bitcoin to hit $200,000? The answer is ‘no.’ Here’s why,” Hougan wrote. Hougan explained that investing in Bitcoin involves making two distinct bets. First, “Bitcoin will succeed in establishing itself as a new ‘store of value’ asset.” Currently, Bitcoin’s market capitalization is approximately 7% of gold’s $18 trillion market. Hougan noted, “If it ‘matures’ and becomes 50% the size of gold, every Bitcoin is worth over $400,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Skyrockets Above $71,000: Key Reasons Explained Second, “Governments will abuse fiat currencies and increase demand for ‘store of value’ assets.” If the market for store-of-value assets triples in size due to such mismanagement, and Bitcoin maintains its 7% market share, “each Bitcoin is worth over $200,000.” He emphasized that these two arguments are independent but can compound. “If Bitcoin matures and the store of value market doubles, you quickly get to seven figures. For what it’s worth (FWIW), I think this is the most likely scenario eventually,” Hougan stated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility To Peak By November 8 As ‘Trump Trade’ Intensifies – Report Addressing the initial question directly, Hougan asserted, “So, no, the dollar doesn’t need to collapse for Bitcoin to hit $200,000. All you need is Bitcoin to continue on its current path of maturing as an institutional asset.” He added that both factors—BTC’s maturation and potential fiat currency abuse—are increasingly likely to occur simultaneously. “That’s why Bitcoin is surging toward all-time highs.” The discussion continued with input from Kevin Brent Cook, a user on X, who added nuance to Hougan’s explanation. “Concise, clear, and simple,” Cook remarked. “I would only add that the reason a ‘collapse’ isn’t necessary is that under ‘abusing fiat’ comes the steady grind of deficit-driven dollar inflation (the US writes endless checks that never bounce), which naturally creates more currency chasing all assets.” Hougan concurred with Cook’s assessment, responding with a succinct “Agreed.” At press time, BTC traded at $72,445, up 23% in the last 20 days.

Wednesday, Oct. 30  Starknet Claims to Shatter Transaction Speed Record Among Ethereum Layer-2 Networks  Starknet, a ZK rollup, said Wednesday it had shattered the record for transactions per second (TPS) among Ethereum layer-2 networks. According to the team, Starknet reached ""a max TPS of 127.5 over the past 24 hours. The milestone occurred during a gaming stress test, which was dubbed 'dress rehearsal for mass use via L2s.' By achieving this metric, Starknet has knocked Coinbase's layer 2 Base off the top spot, beating Base’s record 24-hour TPS of 79.92 TPS by a large margin, according to L2Beat. During the stress test, which was a joint effort of StarkWare, game development firm Cartridge and the Starknet Foundation, 11 million daily transactions were recorded. The peak TPS was 857."" According to a press release: ""The stress test was conducted with a game called 'flippyflop,' developed by Cartridge. The tile game saw users competing against bots to check tiles on the grid. Bots worked to undo the gamers’ work by unchecking tiles at random. As such the theme was 'human vs. machine.' The high pace of simple transactions generated during this game was designed to be the ultimate test for Starknet’s TPS.""

This allows Orbit chains and user withdrawals to achieve a fast confirmation frequency within fifteen minutes.

35337475,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650658,1730304019,"Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Is Approaching Strongest Part Of The Bull Run, Here’s The Target","Crypto analyst Tony Severino has said that the Bitcoin price is approaching the strongest part of the bull run. Based on his analysis, Tony provided insights into how high the flagship crypto could rise as it approaches its peak in this market cycle. Bitcoin Price Target For Strongest Part Of This Bull Run Tony revealed in an X post that the Bitcoin price could reach a market top of $133,000 in this bull run. He explained that the BTC 2-month Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching 70, which has ignited the strongest part of every past bull run. In 2012, this led to a price surge of 11,000%. Meanwhile, it led to a price rally of 2,700% and 437% in the 2016 and 2020 bull run, respectively. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is About To Complete This Breakout To A Descending Megaphone Pattern, Is $1 Next? The analyst noted that each peak in the successive bull run has been roughly around 20% of the previous cycle peak. Therefore, 20% of the 437% rally recorded in the 2021 bull run will put the Bitcoin price at this $133,000 price target. A potential rise to this target would give those buying BTC at its current price level a return of around 87%. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also suggested buying the Bitcoin price as this level may not be a late entry. In an X post, he explained that the Market Value To Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has crossed over its 365-SMA (Simple Moving Average), a development that often signals major bull rallies. He added that this golden cross has just happened again. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price increased by 236% the last time this happened. Therefore, this indicates that despite the recent rally above $73,000, there is still so much upside for the flagship crypto in this market cycle. BTC Could Rise To $462,000 Ali Martinez provided a more bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price than Tony regarding how high the flagship crypto could rise in this bull run. In an X post, he noted that BTC peaked between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels in the past bull cycles. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Ready For A Breakout As Metrics Turn Bullish, What To Expect If the Bitcoin price were to follow a similar pattern, Martinez remarked that the next BTC top could land between $174,000 and $462,000. Predictions on what could mark the top for Bitcoin in this market cycle continue to differ, although the consensus remains that the flagship crypto would rise above $100,000. Experts like Standard Chartered have even predicted that the Bitcoin price could rise above this $100,000 target this year if Donald Trump wins the US presidential elections. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $72,300, up almost 2% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Israeli cybersecurity firm Ironblocks' new network is betting on it.  On Wednesday, the firm is beginning a phased roll-out of a new Web3 security layer it's developing, called Venn. The transaction pre-screening network seeks to create ""a new economy"" for crypto security, said creator Or Dadosh, also Ironblocks' CEO.  Venn plans to match security operators and their technical know-how with crypto apps that want extra eyes on their transaction flow. A participating DeFi app might pay out crypto rewards to auditors and cybersecurity firms who vet pending transactions, Dadosh said.  All this happens before any crypto transaction actually executes. In the Venn model, pending trades, swaps, borrows and transfers pass through its network first. Security operators flag and freeze any suspicious actions. They forward regular activity onto the blockchain for confirmation.  ""It's just like a firewall in the Web2 world,"" Dadosh said.  DeFi heavy hitters including Ether.Fi and Ethena are joining Venn's public testnet, according to Dadosh. A bevy of security firms are, too.

Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis said in a letter to the state's investment managers that they should check out that option.  Florida's chief financial officer proposed that the funds that support retired state workers should dabble in crypto, inspired by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's support for the U.S. government stockpiling bitcoin {{BTC}}.

""Bitcoin is often called 'digital gold,' and it could help diversify the state’s portfolio and provide a secure hedge against the volatility of other major asset classes.""  He suggested the organization that manages the state pensions that serve Florida's retired firefighters, teachers and other public workers should study how crypto investing may fit into one of its funds and offer ""potential benefits we cannot afford to overlook,"" according to the letter dated on Tuesday.  Patronis, who is one of three trustees along with the governor and state attorney general, asked the organization to come back with a report that can inform state lawmakers before the next session.

Continued negative sentiment around ETH's loss of market share could lead to a short squeeze.  Ether {{ETH}} might be primed for a period of upside price action after sharply underperforming against bitcoin {{BTC}} in recent months. Skeptics have claimed that the emergence of layer-2 networks has seen Ethereum fall out of favor among DeFi traders, but the data tells a different story.  Has the move begun today? Maybe, maybe not, but ether is higher by 2.5% over the past 24 hours against a very modest decline in the price of bitcoin, according to CoinDesk data. Alongside, $17 million worth of ether short bets were liquidated across derivatives exchanges thanks to ETH's gain.  Prior to today, ether had been down more than 10% over the prior 6 months versus a 22% advance for bitcoin, bringing the ETH/BTC ratio to its weakest level since April 2021.  Ether itself has remained in the same trading range since early August, with the current level of $2,700 providing two firm rejections on Sep. 27 and Oct. 21. During that period bitcoin surged from below $60,000, yesterday testing its record high from March of just shy of $73,800. Ether remains about $2,000 below its record high set all the way back in November 2021.  The relative underperformance of ETH in recent month has led to widespread bearish sentiment and disappointment in the asset, which has a market cap of $322 billion. One catalyst behind the negative narrative is the abundance of layer-2 networks which are taking market share, liquidity and volume away from the main Ethereum network.  Several key metrics including new wallets and number of transactions have also continued their respective downtrends. These metrics can lead traders to heap on short positions, which can lead to a turbulent ""short squeeze.""  Data from DefiLlama, however, shows that Ethereum still commands more than 55% of the total value locked (TVL) across all DeFi networks and protocols, with the figure topping $50 billion.

42373361,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt580E8,1730302507,From Existential to Irrelevance Risk,"In the early days of cryptocurrency, existential risk was the dominant concern. We woke up in the morning wondering whether some government might ban it, or if some major stablecoin like tether could collapse, or if a major hack would wipe out an entire chain. But as crypto adoption advanced and became more integrated into the traditional financial system, these existential fears have largely faded. Especially with the approval of the ETFs in the U.S., the possibility of total collapse seems very remote.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Crypto is not going away.  But the industry faces the next big risk on the way to a maturing asset class: irrelevance. The notion of irrelevance risk might just be the most pressing concern for the crypto market today.  Consider the comparison — however fraught with nuance — between crypto and emerging markets (EM). In the early 2000s, there was immense enthusiasm around the potential of countries like Brazil, Turkey, India, China, and Poland. EM assets were seen as the next big growth sector — remember the BRICs acronym coined by Goldman’s Jim O’Neill? One could walk into a meeting with a senior global portfolio manager and fluently discuss local markets in Indonesia, or politics in Mexico, or the bewildering monetary policy of the Turkish central banks. EM had so much promise, growth potential, and inefficiencies (remind you of anything?)  But, over time, interest in EM began to fade. Now, the sector is often relegated to smaller, more specialized teams, likely comprising a much smaller portion of macro funds’ asset allocation. Now, PMs spend their time on the big fish like semiconductors, AI, U.S.-European rates, and commodity cycles. Why? In short, EM assets just didn’t deliver returns.  Similarly, while there is still a great deal happening in the crypto space — such as bitcoin ETFs receiving inflows, Ethereum scaling solutions gaining traction, and Solana promising a faster, more scalable network — there’s a risk that none of this will translate into sustained growth. Just as EM had moments of brilliance but failed to capture long-term interest, crypto faces a similar challenge.  The good news is that the industry’s success depends more on its own efforts and less on exogenous factors such as regulation. Moreover, there are plenty of potential catalysts to jumpstart crypto’s future. Here is a non-exhaustive list:  The rate differential between DeFi and traditional markets is improving as central banks continue cutting rates.  Search for alternative returns as the Mag7 concentration broadens.  Re-linking of BTC with the liquidity cycle.  Less crypto-averse policymakers picked under the next U.S. presidency and a favourable regulatory trend in many other countries.  Inflows picking up for BTC and (hopefully) ETH ETFs.  Stablecoin projects scaling and calling attention to the sector.  A few of the many games in development getting moderate traction.  Crypto doesn’t need a single breakthrough ""killer app"" to remain relevant but rather a series of incremental successes across decentralized finance, stablecoins, and innovative blockchain applications. Five-to-ten Polymarket-scale protocols with similar recognition might do it.  The future remains uncertain, but the possibilities for avoiding irrelevance are certainly within reach.

42373365,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt580J8,1730302081,How Public Blockchains Will Catalyze Institutional DeFi Adoption,"The tokenized asset market is set for explosive growth with Boston Consulting Group forecasting it to reach $16 trillion by 2030. Public blockchains are becoming central to institutions’ abilities to bring traditional financial assets on-chain, by delivering not only operational efficiency but also enhanced security, verifiable trust, and revenue-generating opportunities. While many are fully open and permissionless — allowing anyone to view transactions, build applications, and participate as validators — others incorporate permissioned elements that provide compliance and controlled participation within the same open network.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Yet a key question remains: which type of blockchain — public or private — will pave the way for institutional mass adoption?  Emerging regulatory frameworks, such as the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and Singapore’s Payment Services Act (PSA), are providing much-needed clarity. Historically, private blockchains have been the go-to choice for institutions, serving as secure and compliance-friendly sandboxes. However, their restricted and siloed nature limits participation, leading to low liquidity, inefficient price discovery, and volatility for otherwise stable assets. With increased regulatory clarity, decentralized blockchains, like Ethereum or Solana, will likely become the favored path for institutions.  Public blockchains: triggering a DeFi domino effect with institutions  Leading firms such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are already embracing public blockchains by bringing regulated traditional financial assets, like tokenized money market funds, onto public blockchains, which is already leading to significant capital flows into DeFi. And over the next five years, we should also expect to see additional financial assets, such as private equity, to move on-chain, further accelerating institutional adoption.  By moving these assets onto public blockchains, these institutions are benefiting from greater transparency and interoperability, which streamline processes and enhance market integration. The 24/7 intraday settlement allows for more efficient capital flow management, without the constraints of traditional trading hours. For investors, these tokenized assets represent low-risk, high-quality liquidity with lower barriers to entry and better availability, making them an attractive option that brings more stability to blockchain-based markets — ultimately supporting broader adoption for DeFi.  Beyond operational efficiency and compliance: exploring revenue and liquidity opportunities  Public blockchains may look to offer compliance features to address operational and regulatory challenges faced by traditional financial institutions. Those could include mechanisms like clawback, which allows issuers to reclaim assets under specific circumstances, and freezing, which restricts accounts from sending or receiving funds to ensure regulatory compliance. Additionally, decentralized identity (DID) solutions provide secure on-chain identity verification, supporting know your customer (KYC) processes.  Source: EY-Parthenon, Gaining Ground: how institutional investors plan to approach digital assets in 2024  But adopting public blockchains also opens up new revenue opportunities through enabling global market access through fractionalization, allowing institutions to engage a broader investor base and boost trading volumes. An emerging use case is the collateralization of tokenized assets, which facilitates borrowing and leveraged trading to improve capital efficiency. Real-time, on-chain collateral management offers faster liquidity and more flexible asset deployment compared to traditional systems.  As public blockchains offer a path to a more productive financial system — the question is no longer whether institutions will adopt them, but how quickly this transformation will unfold. One thing is clear — this shift is not just redefining finance; it’s laying the groundwork for DeFi to become a fundamental part of the global financial markets.  Public blockchains can serve a similar role to that of the open, public internet, which improved upon closed networks and enabled global connectivity, innovation and growth. With their open architecture and unrestricted participation, public blockchains are set to transform global finance and enable an Internet of Value.

According to data, Bitcoin jumped by 6% to hit $73,544 late Tuesday, its highest market price since March 14th. With this latest price surge, Bitcoin’s October gain is up by 13%, better than the top performers in the S&P with an average 1% increase.

A Bullish Bitcoin Ahead Bitcoin’s jump to $73,500 during US trading hours Tuesday narrowly missed its all-time high set on March 14th. However, a few developments and favorable market conditions can help push Bitcoin to higher highs in the next few days. Firstly, Bitcoin has finally snapped its seven-month downtrend. For weeks, the top crypto has consolidated at just above the $68,000 level, and this stability motivated traders and investors to push the price. B I T C O I N $BTC There are numerous ways to determine targets. One variable is whether semi-log or linear scale is used Target of 94,000 is measured move of triangle projected from breakout level on semi-log ⬇️ 🧵 1/3 pic.twitter.com/VI0n7OAvia — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 29, 2024 Just this Monday, Bitcoin topped the psychological $70,000 support before getting a bigger push from inflows from ETFs and trades by whales. Many market analysts, including experienced trader Peter Brandt, set an even bolder target: Bitcoin will reach $94,00 to $160,000 soon. Second, the price movement has liquidated plenty of short positions and effectively passed sell walls between $65,000 and $71,000. This development established a positive mood by leaving short traders on the edge. Thirdly, its industry domination is now at 60%, its highest since March 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Breaks With Nearly $80 Million Outflows In Sudden Reversal Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Rising The ongoing large inflows into the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved in January also play a major role in the recent spike of the cryptocurrency. Based on Bernstein’s data, in the past few months the top BTC ETFs have drawn billions of inflows from businesses and institutional investors. These funds’ total assets under management as of October 28th already surpass $68 billion and are further likely to rise. Then, with about $43 billion of interest, there is also increasing curiosity in crypto futures. This rise in trading volume points to positive attitude among traders and demonstrates increased interest of market players. All Eyes On The US Elections Perhaps the biggest driver of Bitcoin’s price is next Tuesday’s scheduled US elections. The rise in price has coincided with Trump’s increasing odds of winning the presidential elections. Initially a “crypto skeptic,” Republican Trump has emerged as a pro-crypto and Bitcoin candidate, calling for a strategic stockpile of the token for the country. All these factors helped Bitcoin’s recent price surge and can power the top crypto to a new all-time high.

The new feature applies to customers in the U.S. and the European Union.  Customers of payments giant Visa (V) can now integrate their eligible debit card into their Coinbase (COIN) accounts and deposit funds, at times instantly, the two firms announced on Tuesday.  The feature applies to users living in the U.S. or the European Union, according to the press release.  They will also be able to buy or sell cryptocurrencies directly on the exchange using the Visa debit card, offering a much easier way for non-savvy crypto folks to invest in the asset class.  While millions of users already use debit cards to connect to their Coinbase accounts, using the Visa debit card will allow for real-time transfers.  “We are thrilled to be partnering with Coinbase to help service their customers’ money movement needs,"" said Yanilsa Gonzalez Ore, Head of Visa Direct, North America for Visa. The feature allows eligible Visa debit card holders to “take advantage of trading opportunities day and night.”  One of the hurdles the cryptocurrency industry has faced is bridging the gap between traditional financial services and tech-savvy crypto offerings which often makes it difficult for everyday users to take advantage of the innovations that may be available.

OP Stack is a toolkit that allows developers to build their own blockchains atop Ethereum layer-2 network Optimism.  Optimism has previous attracted exchanges Coinbase and Kraken to use it as the venue for building their blockchains.  Ethereum layer-2 Optimism's ""Superchain"" has added a Bitcoin-native project to its ecosystem for the first time, CoinDesk is first to report.  BOB, a Bitcoin layer-2 project looking to expand development on the world's oldest blockchain, has integrated with the Superchain ecosystem, built on Optimism’s OP Stack framework.  Under the deal, BOB is expected to receive a grant from the Optimism Foundation currently valued at about $870,000, project officials confirmed to CoinDesk, while cautioning that the amount has not been finalized.  OP Stack is a toolkit that allows developers to build their own blockchains atop Ethereum layer-2 network Optimism.  BOB refers to itself as a ""hybrid layer-2"" network – built on Bitcoin but with Ethereum compatibility. Its aim is to create bridges between itself and layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum, with the ultimate goal of making Bitcoin the center of decentralized finance (DeFi).  ""Joining the Superchain means doubling down on our hybrid vision and ensuring that Bitcoin builders on BOB always have the latest tech out of the box to use in their BTC products,"" BOB co-founder Alexei Zamyatin told CoinDesk in a a Telegram message.  Optimism has attracted crypto exchange Coinbase to use OP Stack for its own blockchain, Base, as well as the rival exchange Kraken, which announced its own network, Ink, last week.  CoinDesk broke the news on Tuesday that as part of that deal, Kraken received a grant from the Optimism Foundation of 25 million OP tokens, worth about $42.5 million based on current pricing.  BOB's price would appear to be lower, having applied for a user incentive grant of 500,000 OP tokens worth $870,000 based on OP's current price of $1.74. This amount is yet to be finalized and could change, project officials told CoinDesk.  Optimism remains well behind of rival Arbitrum among Ethereum layer-2 projects for total-value locked (TVL). Optimism has a TVL of just over $6 billion, compared to Arbitrum's $13 billion.  But the wider family of projects using Optimism's technology total over 40 rollups, with more than $18 billion in TVL.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Is Currently At Relatively Low Levels As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the short-term holder SOPR is still under the range that has signaled overheated conditions for the asset during the past year. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR) here refers to an indicator that tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or loss. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales Withdraw $750 Million In ETH From Exchanges When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder on the network is transferring their coins at a net profit. On the other hand, it being under this mark implies loss-taking is dominant. In the context of the current discussion, the SOPR of a specific segment of the BTC userbase is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). This cohort includes the BTC investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As the STHs are relatively young holders, they don’t carry much resilience, and thus, can be prone to panic selling whenever a major change occurs in the market, like a rally or crash. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH SOPR over the past year or so: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH SOPR has been above the 1 level recently, suggesting that this group has been realizing a net amount of profit with their transactions. With the latest bullish push that BTC has seen beyond the $71,000 level, the metric has seen some uplift, as the STHs have ramped up their profit-taking. The indicator is now sitting at 1.017. It’s apparent from the chat, however, that this is not actually that high a value. According to the quant, the indicator has shown to be overheated whenever it has broken 1.03 during the recent phase of consolidation. The latest value has clearly been under this mark. As such, the rally could have more room to grow, before the profit-taking from the STHs becomes a threat. This is only assuming that the same 1.03 boundary would apply to the current market as well, since the STH SOPR had been able to visit much higher levels before Bitcoin had encountered a top in March of this year. Related Reading: “Time To Get Ready For Another Bull Run,” Bitcoin Analyst Says— Here’s Why The indicator could be to monitor in the coming days, as where it goes next could provide hints about where the cryptocurrency’s price might also be going.

As well as earning USDC or reward points, AI workers post collateral and like a proof-of-stake blockchain, that collateral can be slashed for cheating or using bots.  Sapien, a startup that incentivizes people to supply all sorts of data for use in AI, has raised $10.5 million in seed funding led by VC firm Variant, with participation from Primitive Ventures, Animoca, Yield Guild Games and HF0.  The Sapien team, led by Rowan Stone, the former co-creator of Coinbase’s layer 2 network Base, and Trevor Koverko, founder of Polymath and author of RWA standard ERC1400, are incentivizing a growing army of data labelling workers with with either USDC stablecoin or a system of reward points. The data work can be anything from labelling everyday items like traffic signs using a mobile device, to pinpointing particular types of cancer cells.  AI is often framed in terms of some insidious dystopian creep that will gradually take over our lives. Less talked about is the flipside, where entirely new forms of work can be created, in this case a global pool of decentralized AI workers.  “The big unlock that OpenAI found was that in order to help AI be smarter and get closer to human level reasoning is to throw industrial scale human labor at the problem,” said Sapien CEO Rowan Stone in an interview. “And so literally, just have lots and lots of people provide their knowledge or their input in order to make the models smarter.”  Sapien is currently working to solve data-driven challenges for 17 large enterprise partners, that includes the likes of Alibaba and Baidu, and the firm has so far recruited over a hundred thousand AI workers to provide data.  There are already large firms harvesting labeled data to train AI applications, some of which use low paid workers in countries like the Philippines. But Sapien wants to gamify this work and make it less of a factory-based activity.  On-chain economics also comes into play because Sapien workers must have some skin in the game in the form of collateral to participate, which they can either earn their way towards having, or they can buy up front.  “The simple mechanism here is exactly like ether proof-of-stake, minus the back of house consensus,” Stone said. “If workers do good work, then they are paid extra because they're valuable to us. If they do bad work, or they cheat, or they use bots, or there's some type of foul play, then we have a method to claw back some of that collateral.”  Angel investors such as YGG founder Gabby Dizon and Softbank Vision Fund alum Kevin Jiang were also included in the seed funding.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/30/ai-data-collection-startup-sapien-raises-105m-seed-funding-led-by-variant,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9697aa96891e77f4eaec54d0c71b0d599b1866b8-1521x856.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the team, Starknet reached ""a max TPS of 127.5 over the past 24 hours.""  ""The milestone occurred during a gaming stress test, which was dubbed 'dress rehearsal for mass use via L2s,'"" a press release stated.  A Starknet spokesperson wrote in an email that the feat knocked Coinbase's layer-2 network, Base, off the top spot, beating Base’s record 24-hour TPS of 79.92 TPS ""by a large margin,"" citing the website L2Beat.  CoinDesk reached out to Coinbase, and a spokesperson responded: ""Overall, Base’s mission is to bring a billion people onchain, and we know we can’t do that alone. Faster and cheaper onchain transactions are an important step to making this technology more accessible to everyone. We believe a rising tide raises all boats, and we're glad to see progress toward even faster onchain transactions across the ecosystem.""  Starknet is seen as one of the top teams building layer-2 networks atop Ethereum, due to its sophisticated cryptography and technical attributes – even though it ranks lower than rival projects on leaderboards of top destinations for decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols. Its total value locked (TVL) — a measure of deposits socked into protocols on the network — currently stands at $235.7 million, according to DeFi Llama. That's well behind Base's $2.64 billion and Arbitrum's $2.44 billion.  But the layer-2 projects are competing on other key metrics – including speed, interoperability and the degree of decentralization.  The latest ""stress test"" of the Starknet network was a joint effort between StarkWare, game development firm Cartridge and the Starknet Foundation.  'Flippyflop'  Some 11 million daily transactions were recorded, and the peak TPS was 857, according to the team.  ""The stress test was conducted with a game called 'flippyflop,' developed by Cartridge,"" a press release stated. ""The tile game saw users competing against bots to check tiles on the grid. Bots worked to undo the gamers’ work by unchecking tiles at random. As such the theme was 'human vs. machine.' The high pace of simple transactions generated during this game was designed to be the ultimate test for Starknet’s TPS.""  It should be noted that Starknet's TPS test may not be an apples-to-apples test comparison versus other networks.  In other contexts, such as with zero-knowledge provers — a crucial component within many blockchain systems — there have been special efforts to conduct tests in a controlled environment.  And often there are tradeoffs – speed versus decentralization, for example.  Read more: What Are Rollups?

42373374,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt582B8,1730295390,"Chainlink Unveils 'Chainlink Runtime Environment,' Aiming for Better Blockchain Workflows","Chainlink says its new Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) aims to streamline blockchain application development by offering a unified environment for cross-chain operations, similar to how JRE revolutionized Java app development.  Modularity and privacy in CRE allow developers to build scalable, privacy-focused financial workflows using components like Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) and cryptographic tools.  HONG KONG – Chainlink on Wednesday unveiled Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), designed for developers to create custom applications across multiple blockchains.  The new offering was unveiled during Chainlink's Smartcon, a side event to Hong Kong Fintech Week.  On stage, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said he hoped history would view CRE as important for bringing traditional finance (TradFi) to Web3 as Cobol — a legacy programming language developed in the late 1950s — was for initially automating finance and the Java Runtime Environment was for bringing finance to the internet in the 1990s.  ""The Chainlink Runtime Environment is the computing environment in which you can run code to interconnect all blockchains, interconnect all the Oracle networks, interconnect all the existing APIs and messages and payment systems into a single application,"" Nazarov during an interview with CoinDesk.  Nazarov emphasized that CRE marks a shift from predefined services to a flexible, microservices-like framework, similar to how the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) enables modularity and compatibility in Java — which helped executives be convinced that widely compatible code could be developed quickly and investing on bringing their banking products to the web would have a high return on investment.  ""CRE cuts development time from months or weeks to days or hours, allowing developers to compose everything in a single codebase,"" he said. ""Just as JRE simplified building Java applications, CRE makes creating decentralized applications faster and easier by providing one unified environment across all blockchains.""  Decentralized Oracle Networks  With each Oracle function in CRE managed by specialized Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs), developers gain the flexibility to build workflows with reusable components, making development and scaling as adaptable as writing Java code once and running it across platforms.  These DONs are groups of independent nodes focused on specific tasks, like reading or writing data, that work together in a modular building-block-like fashion to aid developers in bringing more financial services on-chain.  Financial institutions, Nazarov explained on stage, can use this flexibility to create compliant, privacy-protected workflows for blockchain applications.  Nazarov said that CRE is designed to enable privacy for institutional transactions on blockchains, a crucial requirement for traditional finance.  ""Privacy is essential for most institutional transactions. Early blockchain technologies attempted to address privacy for the TradFi community but fell short, which is why many in TradFi have yet to fully adopt blockchain,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview.  CRE achieves this through advanced cryptographic tools like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which allow for private data handling across chains. For instance, CRE can route sensitive blockchain events into confidential computing instances that process data without exposing it publicly.  The computation happens securely, and only the result, known as a verified output, is returned as a zero-knowledge proof, which maintains the privacy of the original data.  CRE is also chain-agnostic, meaning, for developers, this modular system removes the need for Chainlink-specific code within their smart contracts, allowing them to create unified workflows without being limited by the chain or data source.  On stage, Nazarov said that Chainlink would roll out CRE in a phased manner similar to Ethereum, with its core services first being Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).  CRE is currently in early access, with a full rollout planned for 2025 to allow developers to explore its features and integrate them into workflows ahead of broader deployment.

This sudden move in funds was detected in the early hours of Tuesday, as blockchain tracking platforms such as Mempool and Whale Alert recorded a transfer of approximately 159.2 BTC, valued at $11.3 million, from this long-dormant wallet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Skyrockets Above $71,000: Key Reasons Explained The last known transaction from this address was back in November 2012, when Bitcoin’s price was around $10, making the wallet’s balance worth below $9,000. 💤 💤 💤 💤 💤 💤 A dormant address containing 749 #BTC (53,227,433 USD) has just been activated after 12.0 years (worth 7,974 USD in 2012)!https://t.co/5SzBYeKlk1 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 29, 2024 Details Of The Moved Millions Data from on-chain monitoring platform Mempool, shows that the recent transaction was conducted at 7:28 a.m. UTC. Of the 159.2 BTC transferred, about 124.2 BTC, or $8.8 million, was sent back to the sender’s address, labeled as “change” by blockchain analytics firm Blockchair. The remaining 35 BTC, or $2.4 million, was transferred to an unknown address. Details surrounding the wallet’s owner and their intentions remain unidentified, leaving the crypto community speculating on the motive behind the transaction and the identity of the long-term Bitcoin holder. However, the timing of the awakening of this dormant wallet is quite noteworthy. It comes at a time when Bitcoin has been seeing consistent increases in price in recent weeks. Particularly, the asset has finally broken above the $70,000 resistance with a current trading price of $72,638 up by 5.3% in the past day. Notably, movements from long-inactive wallets have historically generated intrigue, with crypto enthusiasts theorizing that these could be the actions of early adopters, lost-and-found wallets, or entities choosing strategic timing to engage with the market. Although the reason behind this wallet move of its BTC isn’t certain, reactivating wallets like this one especially as Bitcoin continues to surge in price might indicate shifts in holders’ strategies, driven by favorable market conditions or other personal financial objectives. Bitcoin Onchain Performance Awakening of wallet aside, Bitcoin has been seeing quite an interesting and positive trend behind the scenes, especially regarding on-chain metrics. So far, analysts have highlighted several BTC metrics that are now flashing a positive momentum for the asset, suggesting further price increases. For instance, yesterday, a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost disclosed that Bitcoin hash ribbons have flashed a buy signal. Darkfost noted: Historically, purchasing Bitcoin during a Hash Ribbons signal has aligned with strong long-term returns. Recently, we saw another signal following the major one this past summer. Another metric suggesting price increase for Bitcoin highlighted by a CryptoQuant analyst named BinhDang is the Stablecoin Supply Ratio Oscillator (SSRO). According to BinhDang in a recent post, this metric has bottomed to levels not seen in 2022. A move that preceded a rally. Notably, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio Oscillator provides insights into Bitcoin market demand by analyzing Bitcoin’s market cap against that of major stablecoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Not Over Yet? This Ratio Has Just Seen A Golden Cross The oscillator measures the extent to which stablecoins, commonly used for Bitcoin purchases, flow into Bitcoin and thus signal purchasing interest. A low value of the metric signals more stablecoins are being converted to Bitcoin, therefore suggesting increasing demand.

42373378,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt582F8,1730290983,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Little Changed After Teasing All-Time High,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,149.28 +0.13%  Bitcoin (BTC): $72,068.34 +0.86%  Ether (ETH): $2,661.30 +1.16%  S&P 500: 5,832.92 +0.16%  Gold: $2,781.56 +0.46%  Nikkei 225: 39,277.39 +0.96%  Top Stories  Having teased a record high, bitcoin traded within a fairly narrow range. BTC fluctuated between $71,150 and $72,500 after climbing to just under $73,000 at around 23:00 UTC on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency rose to over $73,500 during the U.S. afternoon on Tuesday. The broader digital asset market is also muted, having gained just under 0.9% in the last 24 hours, with ETH rising about 1.15% and SOL falling by over 2.5%.  Spot bitcoin ETFs recorded their third-highest inflows on Tuesday, adding more than $870 million. Total trading volumes crossed $4.75 billion — the highest since March — with BlackRock's IBIT accounting for $3.3 billion alone. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he expects bigger inflow figures in the coming days. “$IBIT traded $3.3b today, biggest number in 6mo, which is a bit odd bc btc was up 4% (typically ETF volume spikes in a downturn/crisis),” Balchunas wrote on X. “Occasionally tho volume can spike if there a FOMO-ing frenzy. Given the surge in price past few days, my guess is this is latter, which means look for big inflows this week.”  The Bhutan government, which holds over $900 million worth of bitcoin, moved a chunk of its holdings to exchanges on Tuesday, sparking speculation that it is on the verge of selling some of its stash in a move that may weigh on market prices. Bhutan’s BTC movements are part of a broader trend of profit-taking among whales as the cryptocurrency's price approaches the record high set in March. As more holders move into profit and look to lock in gains, their market activity may slow the climb toward the record, CoinDesk research noted earlier this month. Even though realized profit in bitcoin peaked on Oct. 8 and has started to slow down, which is a positive development, there remains higher profit-taking than the yearly average.

Key metrics from IntoTheBlock reveal that DOGE network activity has spiked multiple times over the past month, a sign of increased engagement that suggests the meme coin could be primed for more gains. As Bitcoin nears its all-time high, the broader crypto market rally is fueling confidence that DOGE may soon challenge its yearly high of $0.228. Related Reading: Cardano Might See A Massive Pump Around November 18 – Analyst Exposes 2020 Similarities The surge in network activity highlights the growing momentum behind DOGE, as new and seasoned investors show heightened interest in the coin. With traders increasingly active, sentiment around Dogecoin has taken a bullish turn, leading many to anticipate further upside. As excitement builds and BTC’s performance hints at continued strength across the market, DOGE’s momentum could see it set new local highs in the coming weeks. Dogecoin Activity Supporting Price Action Dogecoin has finally made its move, and many analysts believe this rally is just beginning. Recent data from IntoTheBlock reveals a substantial uptick in daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network, with several notable spikes in activity over the past month. This increase in network engagement is often a bullish indicator, signaling rising demand and optimism among traders. As DOGE now tests a critical supply level around $0.18, bulls are focused on maintaining momentum to break through this barrier and ultimately target the yearly high of $0.228. Analysts suggest that a successful breakout above $0.18 could set the stage for Dogecoin’s next significant rally. However, if bulls face resistance at this level, a retrace to lower demand zones could provide the liquidity needed to fuel the next leg up. Related Reading: GOAT Outpaces PEPE Growing To $900M Market Cap In 2 Weeks – Details The heightened network activity is a promising signal for the DOGE community, as it indicates that new interest is backing price action. With Bitcoin leading the market higher, Dogecoin could continue to benefit from the current wave of enthusiasm in crypto, positioning it well to challenge new highs. For now, DOGE remains one of the coins to watch closely as it navigates critical resistance, with traders eager to see if it can ride this wave toward new heights. DOGE Price Action Signals Strength Dogecoin is trading at $0.172, following a robust 39% surge after rebounding from its daily 200 moving average (MA) at $0.127. Holding this key indicator as support has signaled renewed long-term strength, underscoring DOGE’s potential for a continuing uptrend. Price action remains resilient, with DOGE holding firmly above the $0.165 level, suggesting that bulls are in control and could drive higher prices. Despite the strong momentum, a healthy retrace to $0.165—or even a lower demand level at $0.15—would support the bullish structure, allowing DOGE to gather the necessary liquidity for another leg up. Holding these levels would position DOGE to push toward its next major target: yearly highs around $0.228. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Fear A Short Squeeze Above $71,000 As Open Interest Rises To $22.6B With bullish sentiment across the crypto market and DOGE showing solid technical indicators, many analysts view these price levels as potential stepping stones for another rally.

42373388,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt582O8,1730289340,Bitcoin Approaches All-Time Highs as Daily OTC Desk Inflows Drop to Year's Lows: CryptoQuant,"Sophisticated investors and high-net-worth individuals often use over-the-counter desks to execute trades without directly affecting the spot-market price.  In the past five months, OTC desks have seen a rise of over 200,000 BTC, one of the highest levels recorded in recent years.  As bitcoin {{BTC}} approaches a record high, sophisticated investors appear to be taking steps to trade without influencing the price in the spot market.  At about $72,300 as of noon in Europe, the largest cryptocurrency by market value is less than 2% below the $73,798 record set in March, according to CoinDesk Indices data. Bitcoin has jumped about 14% this month, on track for the biggest one-month gain since March.  A remarkable feature of this recent bitcoin run is that over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which allow two parties to trade directly without disclosing information to the wider market, now hold 416,000 BTC ($30 billion) compared with an average of less than 200,000 BTC during the first quarter, according to CryptoQuant data.  OTC desks are primarily used by institutions or high-net-worth individuals who prefer to avoid having their transactions appear on crypto exchange order books, allowing them to transact large quantities without affecting the market price. The growing flow to OTC desks is one reason the bitcoin price has been trending in a sideways channel for the past seven months.  With an abundance of bitcoin on OTC desks, the U.S. spot-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could make purchases without affecting the spot price.  Even Tuesday's record daily purchases by the bitcoin ETFs represent just 2% of the total bitcoin balance on OTC desks. During the first quarter, with bitcoin posting an all-time high shortly after the ETFs received regulatory approval, the share of inventory ranged between 9% and 12%.  The total OTC desk balance, however, has held pretty steady since the beginning of September. The 30-day change is just 3,000 BTC, down from a June high of 92,000 BTC. During the first quarter, the pent-up demand led to a negative 30-day change in OTC desk balances, which helped propel the asset to its record high.  For bitcoin to go higher this cycle, daily inflows into OTC desks need to start reducing, as is observed currently. Daily inflows into OTC desks have declined to the lowest levels this year. CryptoQuant notes that in October, OTC desks averaged around 90,000 bitcoin, a reduction of 52% compared with the first three quarters of the year.  If demand for BTC continues accelerating amid low inflows into OTC desks, this could propel bitcoin to new highs.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/30/bitcoin-approaches-all-time-highs-as-daily-otc-desk-inflows-drop-to-years-lows-cryptoquant,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8f0c20bc2a8fd5c4cdbfd2ed80408be8459a5b5-1282x696.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35330977,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=99853,1730286339,"Expert Predicts Ethereum Surge to $6,000 After Holding Major Support","Seasoned market analyst Ali Martinez predicts that Ethereum, the second-largest crypto asset, will surge past its all-time high to new prices after holding major support. Despite Bitcoin being less than 2% away from its all-time high of around $74,000, Ethereum remains miles off its peak price. The altcoin king is 45.21% away from its highest-ever traded price of $4,891, achieved in November 2021. Notably, Ethereum's performance gap compared to its caliber assets remains obvious. For context, Bitcoin has appreciated 13.53% and Solana 14.53% in the past 30 days, while Ethereum has managed just 2.21% within the same timeframe. Ethereum’s recent underwhelming trend saw it retrace to major support at $2,400, the lower boundary of its multi-month ascending channel. Amidst the rebound from the trendline, market expert Ali Martinez has asserted that Ethereum will surge past its previous all-time high to unprecedented price levels in the near term. Ethereum Poised for Surge to $6,000 In an October 29 post , Martinez shares that Ethereum looks ready for an upside move to the $6,000 price mark after holding a major demand zone. The market expert noted that the altcoin king successfully defending the support at $2,400 signals an impending bullish upsurge. Notably, Ethereum bounced from an October 26 low of $2,391, surging over 11% from the level to the current market price. With the support preventing further downsides, Martinez asserted that Ethereum will move past its previous high of $4,891 to an all-time high of $6,000. The price target continues the ascending channel, with Martinez identifying the $6,000 zone as the upper boundary of the asset’s price structure. Notably, a surge to the unprecedented level will entail a 123% surge from the current market price. Ethereum’s Price Analysis Meanwhile, The Crypto Basic analysis shows that, in the short-term, Ethereum targets the price range between $2,750 and $2,875 after holding the support. The asset sustainably showed bullish momentum after printing five consecutive green candles. Furthermore, data from IntoTheBlock shows Ethereum is gaining momentum as on-chain analysis has mostly flipped favorable. The concentration of whale positions turned bullish, signaling expectations of higher prices among large Ethereum holders. Also, futures market momentum stands at 0.75, indicating that most Ethereum derivative traders are bullish on the second-largest crypto asset. However, the net network and large transaction indicators signal market neutrality.

35322264,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650597,1730284250,"Bitcoin Needs Daily Close Above $76,000 To Confirm True Breakout: Analyst","Bitcoin (BTC) is closing in on its all-time high (ATH), bringing excitement among bulls. However, seasoned analyst Peter Brandt advises caution, urging bulls to stay excited yet avoid becoming dogmatic. Bitcoin Breakout Yet To Be Confirmed After a lackluster start to October – a historically bullish month for Bitcoin – the digital asset is exchanging hands at $71,789, just about 3% shy of its March 2024 ATH of $73,737. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $100,000 By February 2025? Analyst Explains Why While the prospect of a new ATH has the crypto market on its feet, veteran analyst and trader Brandt thinks multiple conditions must be fulfilled to determine a confirmed breakout. In a post published on X on October 29, Brandt cautioned BTC bulls against over-enthusiasm without technical confirmation of a breakout. Specifically, the analyst warned the bulls about the limitations of diagonal patterns – particularly those with slanted boundary lines – on trading charts. Brandt explained that although “nicking” of a boundary line might excite the bulls, it does not represent a confirmed breakout. For a breakout to be genuine, Brandt has set the target price at $76,000, stating that Bitcoin’s daily chart needs to close above this level, with an average true range (ATR) measurement confirming this move above Bitcoin’s previous high set in March. For the uninitiated, the ATR is a technical analysis indicator that measures market volatility by calculating the average of true price ranges over a set period, typically 14 days. It reflects how much an asset moves, helping traders gauge potential price fluctuations and set more informed stop-loss or profit targets. Further, Brandt notes that such a breakout must be validated by a close on Sunday at midnight UTC, to ensure it is not a fake breakout that ends up trapping bullish investors. On the weekly chart, Brandt highlighted that Bitcoin’s recent advance “has only nicked important chart points,” rather than breaking through with conviction. The analyst concluded that BTC’s price has a substantial journey ahead before decisively forming a new support level. Important To Overcome $71,000 – $73,000 Resistance Level Another crypto analyst, 0xAmberCT, highlighted the significance of the strong resistance zone around $71,000 to $73,000. However, the analyst shared several reasons why this time might be different. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders See $80,000 BTC By November End, US Election Outcome Irrelevant First, the high odds of victory for the Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump might provide the much-needed fuel to the wider crypto market to start its Q4 2024 rally. At the time of writing, Polymarket gives Trump a 66.5% chance of victory compared to Democratic candidate Kamala Harris’ 33.5%. A Trump win is a net positive for the digital assets industry. In addition, the recent interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the heightened prospects of a “soft-landing” are expected to increase the market’s risk-taking appetite. Risk-on assets like BTC are expected to benefit in a lower interest rate environment. The analysts’ assessment aligns with Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s prediction that BTC may “melt-up” to $80,000 in Q4 2024. However, crypto analyst Cole Garner recently shared that BTC might head lower before achieving a new ATH due to tightening on-chain liquidity. BTC trades at $71,789 at press time, up 4% in the past 24 hours.

42373387,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt582N8,1730281899,Bitcoin Profit-Taking Continues as BTC Price Nears High. Is Bhutan Next to Sell?,"The government of Bhutan deposited almost 1,000 bitcoin into a deposit address on crypto exchange Binance on Tuesday.  The largest cryptocurrency surpassed $73,000 on Tuesday, approaching its record high, with many investors selling to lock in gains as 99.7% of the circulating supply was in profit.  The Bhutan government, which holds over $900 million worth of bitcoin {{BTC}}, moved a chunk of its holdings to exchanges on Tuesday, according to Arkham Intelligence, sparking speculation it is on the verge of selling some of its stash in a move that may weigh on market prices.  Bhutan moved $65 million worth of bitcoin to crypto exchange Binance late Tuesday as the largest cryptocurrency neared a lifetime peak above $73,500, Arkham data shows. BTC dropped to around $72,400 as of mid-morning in London, according to CoinDesk Indices.  The tiny, picturesque Southeast Asian nation emerged as a BTC whale — an influential holder of the asset — earlier this year after Arkham identified wallets belonging to Bhutan for the first time, making it the second nation after El Salvador to officially hold BTC.  The country's bitcoin holdings represent nearly a third of its gross domestic product (GDP) and were gained through mining operations run by state-owned Druk Holdings. The mining is linked to Bitdeer Technologies Group (BTDR), which has been expanding mining facilities in the country and is aiming for a 600 megawatt capacity by 2025.  Bhutan's investment in digital assets is part of a broader strategy by Druk to diversify revenue streams, with recent wallet activity showing both deposits and withdrawals, including significant transactions with exchanges like Kraken. An email to the department on the bitcoin movements to exchanges and any related plans did not receive a reply prior to publication.  Meanwhile, Druk wallets tracked by Arkham show brisk deposit and withdrawal activity in the past few weeks. It has received up to 2 BTC from Foundry, another miner, and other unidentified Bitcoin addresses several times over the past week.  Profit-taking  Bhutan’s BTC movements are part of a broader trend of profit-taking among whales as the cryptocurrency's price approaches the record high set in March.  As more holders move into profit and look to lock in gains, their market activity may slow the climb toward the record, CoinDesk research noted earlier this month. Since Oct. 17, when the research was published, profit-taking has not abated, but it still seems as though a new all-time high is on the cards.  Even though realized profit in bitcoin peaked on Oct. 8 and has started to slow down, which is a positive development, we are still seeing higher profit-taking than the yearly average.  As of Tuesday, 99.7% of the circulating supply was in profit, with $1.5 billion of realized profit taken. Most of that has come from larger entities holding at least 100 BTC, according to Glassnode data.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ARKM,"James Van Straten, Shaurya Malwa",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/30/bitcoin-profit-taking-continues-as-btc-price-nears-high-is-bhutan-next-to-sell,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c7b87dff87eb1960168f248263be166a54720a2-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what this could imply for ADA’s price. Cardano NVT Ratio Has Surged To Its Highest Level Since June In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock discusses the latest trend in Cardano’s NVT Ratio. The “NVT Ratio” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the ADA market cap and transaction volume. When the value of this metric is high, it means the value of the network is high compared to its ability to transact coins. Generally, this can signal that the coin’s price is overvalued. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales Withdraw $750 Million In ETH From Exchanges On the other hand, the low indicator implies the market cap may be undervalued compared to the blockchain’s volume, so ADA’s price could be due to a rebound. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Cardano NVT Ratio over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Cardano NVT Ratio has witnessed a notable surge recently, even though the coin’s price has been following an overall bearish trajectory. This would suggest that the transaction volume has tanked on the network. Following this latest increase, the indicator has spiked to the highest level since June, implying that the cryptocurrency hasn’t been this overvalued in six months. The reason behind this trend is likely to be the lackluster price action the coin has witnessed for a while now. Other assets, such as Bitcoin, have started to pop off recently. At the same time, ADA has remained a sideways movement, so ADA investors may be fed up and leave to explore greener pastures. Related Reading: “Time To Get Ready For Another Bull Run,” Bitcoin Analyst Says— Here’s Why “Historically, elevated NVT ratios often precede price pullbacks,” notes the analytics firm. Thus, the recent spike in the indicator could spell further trouble for the already struggling coin. The Cardano NVT Ratio could now be to keep an eye on in the coming days, as any more jumps in the metric may confirm a bearish outcome. However, there is also the possibility that the trend will see a reversal, with enough activity returning on the network to justify its current market cap. ADA Price The cryptocurrency sector as a whole has been rising during the past day, and Cardano has followed suit. Although the coin’s surge has been smaller than Bitcoin’s, the asset has climbed above the $0.348 level. The chart below shows the coin’s recent trajectory.

35315702,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650608,1730273438,Solana Memecoin Market Thrives: POPCAT Reaches New Record Price Of $1.75,"The Solana (SOL) memecoin ecosystem is regaining traction with investors as Bitcoin (BTC) leads the overall market recovery, approaching its previous record high of $73,700 set in March. This renewed interest is reflected in the performance of Popcat (POPCAT), one of the outstanding and best-performing tokens in the Solana memecoin space over the past month. Wintermute Fuels The POPCAT Bullish Trend POPCAT has emerged as a significant winner in the Solana chain in the past week, experiencing a 21% surge. Following a continued uptrend, the token recorded a 13% increase in just 24 hours, reaching a new all-time high of $1.75 on Tuesday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Triggers Golden Cross: What This Means For The Crypto Trend According to data from Nansen, the driving force behind this bullish trend has been a notable increase in buying pressure, largely attributed to market-making trading firm Wintermute, which has played a pivotal role in facilitating buying transactions within the digital asset. However, shortly after hitting its record peak, POPCAT retraced to approximately $1.70, attributed to increased profit-taking by investors, as many sought to capitalize on the recent gains. Nansen’s data indicates a pattern of transfers to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for selling purposes, signaling a typical market behavior following a significant price surge and the achievement of a new record price. One of the key players in these transactions is the crypto exchange Bybit, which has been transferring POPCAT tokens in batches to the US-based exchange Kraken over the past few days. Despite these transfers, Bybit still retains around 63,602 POPCAT coins, valued at approximately $109 million. To avoid a sharp correction and maintain the upward momentum, it will be crucial for the POPCAT bulls to hold key support levels in the coming days, and in particular, to hold and consolidate above the $1.70 level. Key Levels To Watch Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the POPCAT token, the most significant support levels are well below current trading prices, which could lead to significant retracement. Looking at the POPCAT/USDT daily chart, the first support is located at the $1.55 zone, which, if lost, could lead to a further pullback down to the $1.48 support. This could jeopardize most of the token’s gains over the last week, as the loss of these levels could lead to a retest of its next support at $1.37. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Ready For A Breakout As Metrics Turn Bullish, What To Expect However, it remains to be seen whether the buying pressure seen over the past week can overcome the current profit-taking activity by investors in the token, as a consolidation above $1.70 in the next 72 hours can lead to a significant bullish weekly close.

At press time, the world’s most valuable coin is approaching $72,000, a critical resistance level that marks June 2024 highs. Bitcoin Breaks Above $70,000 And Descending Triangle As buyers press on, reversing losses of the second half of last week and soaring to print a three-month high, one analyst has also picked out another crucial development. In a post on X, the technical analyst said not only is the price firm at press time, but the explosion over the last two days means the coin is trading above a descending wedge. Related Reading: Neiro Breaks Above Key Level Following 10% Weekly Drop, Is $0.0020 Next? Technically, based on the analyst’s preview, the coin is within a key breakout formation. Accordingly, it signals that the era of discouraging lower lows, seen in the better part of Q3 2024, could be over as buyers take over. Specifically, the series of lower and lower highs seen since prices retraced from all-time highs is likely over. As it is, buyers are buoyant. According to the CoinMarketCap poll, over 70% of voters think the coin is heading higher. This preview is crucial, considering the importance of hype in the crypto scene. Usually, whenever prices tick higher, traders tend to rush in so as not to miss the leg up by opening leveraged positions on perpetual futures platforms like Binance or Bybit. Meanwhile, the more conservative ones opt to buy at the spot market, aware that though gains could be posted, risks are also mitigated. Is The Post-Halving Advance On? For the uptrend to continue, the analyst said, it is important gains posted on the last two days are confirmed. In this case, a follow-through will see Bitcoin lift off, breaking $72,000 and even $74,000 printed in March 2024. In that event, bulls could have more headroom to march on as the “post-Halving” advance begins. Looking at past cycles, Halving events are always seen as bullish. Prices rallied in the next few months when the network halved its miner rewards in 216 and 2020. Then, Bitcoin rallied to $20,000 in 2017 and $70,000 in 2021.

This surge in investments coincided with bitcoin's price nearing its all-time high, fueled by pre-election market volatility expectations.  Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the U.S. recorded over $870 million in net inflows on Tuesday, the third-highest such figures since the products first went live in January.  BlackRock’s IBIT logged over $629 million in inflows, SoSoValue data shows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $133 million, Bitwise’s BITB at $52 million, Grayscale’s mini bitcoin trust (BTC) at $29 million, VanEck’s HODL at $16 million and Ark’s ARKB at $12 million.  Grayscale’s bitcoin trust (GBTC) was the only ETF recording net outflows at $17 million. Total trading volumes crossed $4.75 billion — the highest since March — with IBIT accounting for $3.3 billion alone.  The ETF demand came as bitcoin fell just shy of its lifetime highs late Tuesday, boosted ahead of next week’s U.S. elections that traders largely consider a harbinger of volatility in the near term. Some target an $80,000 price level in November regardless of a Democrat or Republican win, with options bets for that price range seeing a surge in demand last week.  BTC jumped 3% Tuesday, extending seven day gains to 7.7% and leading a market move higher.  Meanwhile, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expects bigger inflow figures in the coming days on investor “FOMO,” or Fear Of Missing Out on a trade.  “$IBIT traded $3.3b today, biggest number in 6mo, which is a bit odd bc btc was up 4% (typically ETF volume spikes in a downturn/crisis),” Balchunas said on X. “Occasionally tho volume can spike if there a FOMO-ing frenzy (a la $ARKK in 2020). Given the surge in price past few days, my guess is this is latter, which means look for (more) big inflows this week.”  High inflows into an ETF is a measure of investor confidence or interest in the underlying asset. While inflows may not directly cause the ETF's underlying assets to increase in value, the buying pressure can lead to a price bump in the near term due to supply and demand dynamics and increased sentiment among traders.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/30/bitcoin-etfs-record-870m-inflows-as-btc-flirts-with-lifetime-highs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27b53cfa82766953ae1a35280e08d80682d4961f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price could gain bullish momentum if it settles above the $0.5500 resistance zone. XRP price is eyeing more gains above the $0.5350 zone.

There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5180 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it settles above the $0.5500 resistance zone. XRP Price Eyes Upside Break XRP price started a decent upward move above the $0.500 zone. There was a move above the $0.5150 resistance but it lagged Bitcoin and Ethereum. The bulls were able to push the price above the $0.5250 resistance. The price traded as high as $0.5307 and is currently consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $0.5250 level. The price dipped and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5112 swing low to the $0.5307 high. The price is now trading above $0.5220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5180 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5112 swing low to the $0.5307 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5280 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5320 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5350. A clear move above the $0.5350 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance or even $0.5850 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Another Setback? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5300 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5210 level. The next major support is near the $0.5180 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5180 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5050 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5000 zone.

35310502,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650605,1730262619,Stablecoins Signal Strong Bitcoin Demand: Could BTC Renew Its ATH Soon?,"The recent activity in Bitcoin price and demand metrics suggests a potential resurgence in market interest, which could lead to a renewed all-time high. So far, Bitcoin has recently achieved a significant price rebound, reclaiming a trading level above $70,000 after a sustained period of resistance just below this price mark. This uptrend follows a 5% increase over the past 24 hours, positioning Bitcoin for $71,933 at the time of writing. One factor influencing this rally is a heightened demand reflected in stablecoin movements, a metric often used to gauge market sentiment and potential buy-in for Bitcoin, CryptoQuant analyst BinhDang highlighted this in a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake Platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash ‘Buy’ Signal: Analysts See New Highs On The Horizon Stablecoin Supply Ratio Oscillator Reflects Demand Surge BinhDang highlighted that the Stablecoin Supply Ratio Oscillator (SSRO) has reached levels previously seen during Bitcoin’s lows, notably those observed in November 2022. The analyst noted: Since Bitcoin bottomed in November 2022, the 90-day and 200-day oscillators have seen lows similar to that bottom during the 3 months of Q3 2024. Notably, the SSRO tool, which gauges the ratio of Bitcoin’s market cap to that of prominent stablecoins like USDT, USDC, BUSD, and others, is a barometer for tracking Bitcoin’s demand relative to stablecoin supply. The oscillator measures the extent to which stablecoins, commonly used for Bitcoin purchases, flow into Bitcoin and thus signal purchasing interest. When the oscillator shows low values, as it did during Bitcoin’s November 2022 low, it implies that stablecoins are more likely to be converted into Bitcoin, increasing demand. This trend has resulted in Bitcoin crossing the $70,000 threshold, encouraging investor sentiment and speculation regarding potential future highs. New Bitcoin ATH On The Horizon? According to BinhDang, BTC could continue its upward movement if the demand holds steady and aligns with favorable macroeconomic data or upcoming election insights. BinhDang wrote: SSRO indicates high demands on the average quarterly data set (90d), breaking above the positive 2-points. If demand continues to sustain and the announcements and news in early November include some favorable macro and election data, a move to and break above the positive 3-points is possible. The analyst notes that a rise above the SSRO’s positive three-point level has coincided with strong bullish cycles in previous periods, specifically in January 2023, October 2023, and February 2024. While BTC has consistently seen increases in price over the past days touching nearly $72,000 today, the asset’s daily trading volume has been on the same trend.

35307843,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650570,1730257221,Bitcoin Volatility To Peak By November 8 As ‘Trump Trade’ Intensifies – Report,"According to Bitfinex, Bitcoin (BTC) volatility is set to intensify over the next week. A “potent mix” of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors has significantly influenced the flagship crypto’s performance, with anticipation for the outcome of the US election and Q4’s close setting a potential target of $80,000 by year-end. Related Reading: Neiro Breaks Above Key Level Following 10% Weekly Drop, Is $0.0020 Next? Bitcoin Volatility About To Reach Its Peak Crypto exchange Bitfinex’s recent report shared that Bitcoin’s price could hit $80,000 by the end of the year due to a convergence of geopolitical uncertainty, macroeconomic factors, seasonality, and the increasing influence of the “Trump Trade.” The report noted that, historically, global macroeconomic trends and geopolitics events influenced BTC’s price. As a result, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seen its price movements driven by the anticipated US Presidential elections. The potential outcome of the elections, scheduled for next week, has affected Bitcoin’s performance throughout the year. Both presidential candidates have acknowledged the crypto industry, with the Republican candidate Donald Trump becoming the sector’s champion after fully embracing Bitcoin and crypto. Trump’s pro-crypto stance increased the correlation between the Republican candidate’s winning odds and Bitcoin’s trajectory. Moreover, the “Trump Trade” narrative reflects “the market’s view of how BTC will fare dependent on the outcome of the election.” Per the report, this narrative has fueled Bitcoin volatility, with the flagship crypto seeing sharp intra-week corrections before rebounding. Last week, BTC saw a 6.2% pullback toward the $65,000 support zone before reclaiming the $68,000 mark again. Bitfinex analysts consider that this pullback might be the first of several “whipsaw price movements” ahead of the elections, affecting BTC’s short-term price as speculation and volatility increase. Additionally, option premiums and estimated daily volatility for the US stock market and Bitcoin are projected to rise significantly next week. The report noted that BTC volatility will peak between November 6 and November 8, when the Election results are expected to be delivered. Reportedly, the highest implied volatility (IV) is for the November 8 strike price “reaching up to over 100 vol for strike prices over $100,000 for BTC.” BTC Poised To Hit $80,000 In Late December The report noted that Bitcoin has shown strength despite the increasing volatility. The flagship crypto “has remained resilient” and held its ground compared to the September lows, surging around 30% from last month’s drop. Additionally, BTC closed September, which has historically been a challenging month for the cryptocurrency, with a 7.29% increase, the highest closing for the month on record. The crypto exchange’s report predicted that October’s close could be “less impressive” due to the volatility. Nonetheless, Bitfinex analysts suggested that Q4’s historically bullish seasonality will still favor a positive rally for BTC. Market positioning shows that end-of-year options have seen a considerable rise in call open interest over the last few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash ‘Buy’ Signal: Analysts See New Highs On The Horizon BTC is expected to continue experiencing higher-than-average volatility and potentially see deep corrections in the coming days. But the market seems poised for a post-election surge above March’s $73,666 all-time high (ATH). Lastly, call options with a December 27 expiry and an $80,000 strike price have seen a steady build-up, suggesting that this target could be in reach by year-end. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $71,197, a $3.4% increase in the daily timeframe.

35302452,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650489,1730246410,"Bitcoin Price Breaks Out Of 7-Month Descending Broadening Wedge Pattern For Continuation Above $70,000","Recent market inflows and dynamics have seen the Bitcoin price breaking free from a 7-month descending broadening wedge pattern. According to crypto analyst Gert van Lagen, Bitcoin’s breakout last week could signal the onset of a major price continuation phase as the bulls aim above the $70,000 mark. Particularly, Van Lagen highlighted that Bitcoin’s ability to successfully retest the upper trendline of this pattern lends strong momentum to the current bullish structure. The descending broadening wedge pattern is a reversal structure in technical analysis, often hinting at a strong trend upon breakout. Bitcoin’s ability to breach the upper trend line reinforces the likelihood of bullish momentum, lending voice to a new all-time high in the coming weeks. Bullish Retest Validates Strong Support For Next Rally At the time of van Lagen’s analysis, the Bitcoin price was retesting a bottom-sloping trend line, which has capped its price rallies since it reached an all-time high of $73,737 in March. By then, Bitcoin had already peaked out of this trend line in the descending broadening wedge and was already on the third candle. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Reach $3 Billion Inflows In October, Retail Investors Lead The Charge – Report As Bitcoin bounced from the upper trend line, van Lagen described this as a “successful bullish retest.” Furthermore, he noted the importance of a bullish trajectory for this pattern, highlighting that the breakout direction is upward 79% of the time. With the Bitcoin price now successfully above this wedge, this next phase could see the cryptocurrency extend its gains and surge above $70,000. As such, the analyst also noted that reaching a new all-time high is essential to fully validating the wave continuation pattern. Key Bitcoin Price Levels To Watch While the breakout and retest offer promising technical signs, van Lagen warned of a critical downside level that traders should monitor. He pinpointed $58,700 as a crucial weekly closing price, below which the bullish structure would be invalidated. In his view, a close below this threshold would disrupt the quick wave five continuation and totally reverse the bullish setup to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $24? Analyst Says No One Will Believe It Until It Happens Interestingly, Bitcoin has managed to push to the upside since this breakout. Particularly, the cryptocurrency has extended gains and has now broken above $71,000 for the first time since June. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $71,150, having reached an intraday high of $71,450 in the past 24 hours. As it stands, Bitcoin is only 3.6% away from reaching uncharted price territories. The only key price resistance level to watch at this point would be the current all-time high. Many Bitcoin metrics point to the continuation of bullish Bitcoin price momentum, at least in the short term. The Bitcoin open interest is now at its highest point of $42.6 billion, which relays a high level of trading activity among Bitcoin traders.
