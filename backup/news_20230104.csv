7063853,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514811,1672875915,US Federal Regulators Warn About Crypto Activities,"The crypto space received more regulatory attention through the end of 2022. The collapse of one of the largest global digital asset exchanges brought massive losses to the industry. This event spurred several watchdogs to express concerns and issue warning on cryptocurrency engagement. Some US Federal regulators have recently commented on crypto activities’ risks. The watchdogs include the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OFOC). Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Withdraws $32M In LTC From Binance, Good Sign For Rally? According to the report on Tuesday, January 3, 2023, some officials of the three regulatory agencies warned lenders about exposure to digital assets. They cited that the escalating risks should not extend to the banking system. Regulators Cited Associated Risks With Crypto Engagement The warning from the watchdogs is coming after the fall of the FTX digital asset exchange in 2022. Millions of customers lost their funds on the distressed platform, estimated to be more than 8 billion. From their observations, the US regulators cited the high volatility and vulnerabilities seen in the cryptocurrency space last year. They noted the importance of hedging the banking system properly. This will ensure that the risks in the crypto space cannot extend to banks. Also, the regulators highlighted some risks from digital asset involvement in the banking systems. These include fraud, scams, regulatory uncertainties with digital asset custody, platform vulnerabilities, ambiguous statements from companies, crypto contagions, and others. As banking system regulators, the watchdogs pledged their undivided regulatory diligence. This means increased caution and stricter rules on banking organizations when it comes to digital exposure. FTX Bankruptcy Created More Doubts Before its implosion, FTX is rated among the leading crypto exchanges worldwide. It had millions of users and investors from different sectors. Due to its bankruptcy, several individuals and firms exposed to the platform suffered huge losses. These outplay raised concerns and reactions both within and outside the digital space. As a result, US regulators have tightened their regulatory rules on digital activities. Related Reading: Brace For Impact? Bitcoin Open Interest RSI Forms Bearish Divergence As revealed in the bankruptcy filing, some small banks exposed to the exchange include Signature Bank and Silvergate. But the two banks reported that they had only a minimal portion of total deposits on the distressed exchange. According to the US regulators, the broader financial system received less impact from the collapse of the FTX exchange. But the effect is still devastating for some individuals and firms that invested in the platform. Hence, the US watchdogs are coming up with regulatory measures to avert future occurrences in the financial sector.",NEGATIVE,LTC,EXCHANGE | FIAT | LTC | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/crypto/us-regulators-warn-about-crypto-activities/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/7063853.jpeg

42413241,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8BBk,1672874284,SEC Pursues $45M Scam Based in Fake Blockchain Technology,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused alleged fraudster Neil Chandran and several others for orchestrating a scheme to get cash from tens of thousands of investors globally on the false promise that they were securing a lucrative deal to sell blockchain technology.  Chandran, who has already been held since last year on federal fraud charges stemming from the same case, owns several companies and scammed investors for more than $45 million through intermediaries who claimed to be sharing information about a pending deal for the technology, which was known to investors as “CoinDeal,” the federal regulator said Wednesday.  The SEC also accused Garry Davidson, Michael Glaspie, Amy Mossel and Linda Knott of working with Chandran in violating U.S. securities laws.  “We allege the defendants falsely claimed access to valuable blockchain technology and that the imminent sale of the technology would generate investment returns of more than 500,000 times for investors,” said Daniel Gregus, Director of the SEC’s Chicago Regional Office. The money actually went to purchase luxury cars, real estate and a boat for the personal use of Chandran and the others, in addition to being misappropriated for his other businesses, according to the SEC and Department of Justice.  CoinDeal is also the name of a cryptocurrency exchange helmed by Adam Bicz and Kajetan Maćkowiak and based in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, having moved there from Malta in 2021; there appears to be no connection between the two.  Companies AEO Publishing Inc, Banner Co-Op, Inc, and BannersGo, LLC were also associated with the Chandran fraud and were said to be the recipients of investors’ cash and crypto payments.  Investors have lamented for months in online forums including Reddit that the deal they pumped money into was apparently a scam, often associated with “Mike G” – another name Glaspie commonly used as he recruited investors.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  ""While we are committed to moving as quickly as possible, this is a very complex process that will take some additional time,"" Derar Islim wrote in a letter sent to clients on Wednesday.  Following the FTX collapse in November, Genesis locked up $900 million of funds from clients of retail crypto brokerage Gemini.  Amid reports of an imminent solution or even a bankruptcy filing, Genesis in early December said some sort of resolution would likely be a matter of ""weeks"" rather than days. Genesis and CoinDesk share the same parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG).  Stakes were upped a bit more on Monday of this week, when Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss blasted DCG CEO Barry Silbert for ""bad faith stall tactics."" In an open letter posted to Twitter, it alleges Gemini has awaited word on a repayment agreement for six weeks to no avail.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at the $16,800 level, up 0.8% over the past 24 hours. Equities closed up as traders considered minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s last meeting in December and potential inflation-taming, interest rate hikes in 2023. The S&P 500 closed up 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.  Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency recently climbed 3.3% to trade around $1,252. The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio could rally toward a two-month high, according to Lewis Harland, a portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital. ""It may be we see a 'bears in disbelief' rally for ETH over the coming weeks,"" he said. Harland said that the Ethereum network's upcoming Shanghai upgrade, which will open withdrawals of staked ether and reduce users’ rollup fees after the implementation of EIP-4844, will serve as bullish catalysts for the cryptocurrency.  Bonk (BONK): The Shiba inu-themed token that was issued on Dec. 25 has returned 2,220% to traders in the past week with a 150% rise at one point Wednesday before it settled at a more recent 95% gain, according to CoinGecko data. The token was airdropped to Solana non-fungible token (NFT) communities and creators, which led to quick hype and massive trading volumes for the token, as CoinDesk reported Tuesday.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin, Ether Respond Positively to Falling Economic Data  By Glenn Williams Jr.  During the hour following the release of the two reports (15:00 UTC: 10 a.m. ET), a brief tug of war occurred between BTC buyers and sellers. Applying Bollinger Bands to BTC's hourly chart shows a reduced price from its 20-period moving average before reversing course into the following hour.  Volume spiked during the hour, implying that trading activity was prodded at least partly by the economic news, and underscoring its relevance. Volume subsequently subsided in the following hour. Applying Bollinger Bands to BTC's daily chart, shows prices settling in above the 20-day moving average and approaching the upper range of the bands. The price range between daily high and low also expanded to its highest point in nearly 14 trading sessions.  A break above the higher Bollinger Band would be a bullish signal, but would likely need a stronger push of momentum. At the moment, this does not appear to be imminent.

7061866,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514782,1672873215,Bottom Signal: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Falls To Three-Year Lows,"Bitcoin is still stalling in terms of its price movement and has not made any significant jumps in the past couple of weeks. However, there could be a change in the trajectory of the digital asset in the coming weeks as the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio could be announcing a bottom signal. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Reaches 2019 Lows Co-founder and CEO of on-chain data analysis firm Cryptoquant recently took to Twitter to share an interesting chart. The image showed that the bitcoin MVRV Ratio has fallen to levels that have not been seen since 2019 – three years ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sees Sharp 3.59% Drop Now, the bitcoin MVRV Ratio compares the market capitalization of BTC to its realized value. This helps to determine if the digital asset is actually trading at a fair value, if it’s overvalued, or if it is currently undervalued. The lower the value falls, the more undervalued BTC is. The times when the BTC MVRV Ratio has fallen to similar levels as the one shown in the Cryptoquant chart has been when the market had reached its bottom. This is during bear markets when prices decline drastically for a stretched-out period of time before bouncing back up. MVRV Ratio falls to 3-year low | Source: Cryptoquant Looking at the chart, it is easy to spot the times when the MVRV Ratio had been so low was when the previous bottom was reached. One time was in 2015, and the other time was in 2019, a couple of months before the bull market was triggered. If history is anything to go by, then this chart shows that the BTC bottom is already in, or very close to it. However, going by the previous timelines of when the MVRV Ratio has declined so low, it could be a few months at least before another bull market is triggered. What To Do With Such Trends With the bitcoin MVRV Ratio being so low, it does provide a unique opportunity for investors to buy the digital asset at one of the lowest possible prices before another bull rally. BTC being so undervalued in previous years has only ended in a bull cycle that saw its price hit a new all-time high. Related Reading: Santiment Paints Bullish Picture For XRP, But This May Not Be The Case Even if this is not the bottom, it may be very close to it, so investors may not suffer heavy losses even if the price ended up falling lower.

Riot shares rose 1.0% in Wednesday after-hours trading. During the month, the company earned $4.9M in power credits as a result of curtailment activity, equivalent to ~290 bitcoins using the December 2022 weighted average daily closing price of $16,967. Riot ( RIOT ) sold 600 BTC, generating net proceeds of ~$10.2M and held ~6,952 BTC as of Dec. 31, 2022, all produced by the company's self-mining operations. The bitcoin miner deployed an addition 16,128 S-19-series miners, bringing its hash rate capacity to a new all-time high of 9.7 EH/s, CEO Jason Les said. A portion of the company's operations at its Rockdale facility sustained some damage from severe winter weather in Texas, impacting ~2.5 EH/S of its total hash rate capacity. But in anticipation of the storm, the company voluntarily curtailed operations to contribute to the stability of the ERCOT grid. With ~1,152 miners staged for deployment, the company expects to have a total of 89,708 miners deployed with a hash rate capacity of ~9.9 EH/s. Additionally, shipments of 5,130 S19-series miners have been initiated and are expected to be received during January 2023. During Q1 2023, the company expects a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 12.5 EH/s, assuming full deployment of ~115,450 Antminer ASICs, but excluding any potential incremental productivity gains from the company’s utilization of 200 MW of immersion-cooling infrastructure.

42420853,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVlt,1672866601,"Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin, Ether Respond Positively to Falling Economic Data","Bitcoin and ether prices responded positively to manufacturing and jobs data Wednesday as investors saw hopeful signs that the economy was contracting, a precursor to lowering inflation, which has bedeviled central bankers and analysts worldwide for more than a year and wounded asset markets of various stripes.  The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were recently up 0.8% and 3.3%, respectively, with bitcoin trading at about $16,800 and ether just over $1,250.  The Institute for Supply (ISM) Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index for manufacturing fell to 48.4 in December, its second consecutive monthly decline. Readings below 50 indicate that the manufacturing sector is contracting.  And the U.S. Department of Labor’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) showed 10.46 million available jobs in November, better than analyst expectations reported to FactSet but down slightly from the previous month. It was the second straight monthly decline in the widely watched measure of job strength.  Many economists say that slowing job growth benefits risk assets because it signals that the economy is cooling and that inflation will likely wane.  At its most recent meeting in December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reiterated its view that the jobs market was overheated, suggesting the economy was not braking fast enough to tame inflation.  Bitcoin and ether trade lower, then reverse  During the hour following the release of the two reports (15:00 UTC: 10 a.m. ET), a brief tug of war occurred between BTC buyers and sellers. Applying Bollinger Bands to BTC’s hourly chart shows a reduced price from its 20-period moving average, before reversing course into the following hour.  Volume spiked during the hour, implying that trading activity was prodded at least partly by the economic news, and underscoring its relevance. Volume subsequently subsided in the following hour.  Applying Bollinger Bands to BTC’s daily chart, shows prices settling in above the 20-day moving average and approaching the upper range of the bands. The price range between daily high and low also expanded to its highest point in nearly 14 trading sessions.  A break above the higher Bollinger Band would be a bullish signal, but would likely need a stronger push of momentum. At the moment, this does not appear to be imminent.  Little evidence at this point indicates that BTC is poised to do anything other than continue trading in a range.  ETH appears to have more wind at its back at the moment, however.  Ether’s hourly chart shows similar activity, which is predictable given its tight correlation to BTC price moves. Volume spiked as well, with its trading range reaching its highest point since Dec 20.  ETH momentum has risen, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 57 versus BTC’s reading of 52. Additionally, ETH’s price breached the top range of its Bollinger Band during the 17:00 UTC (12:00 ET) hour.

The SEC said it has communicated its concerns to Binance.US’ counsel, and has been told that a revised disclosure statement will be filed prior to the next hearing on the motions.  Voyager plans to seek the approval of the bankruptcy court for the sales of its assets at a hearing on Jan. 5.

The exchange’s market share was just 45% at the start of last year, but the elimination of trading fees in June, not to mention the collapse of rival FTX in November, served to push users to Binance. which is the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume.  “No matter how you look at it in terms of trading activity, Binance is the crypto market,” Arcane wrote. “After lifting trading fees for its BTC spot pairs this summer, Binance completely overtook all market share in the spot market.”  A report from CryptoCompare showed Binance’s overall year-end crypto market share was 66.7%. Coinbase (COIN) came in second with a relatively tiny 8.2%.  “Retail crypto could enter a dark age that takes forever to exit” should Binance fail, Edward Moya, a senior analyst at foreign-exchange trading firm Oanda, said. “Binance is too big … It is not healthy to have so much of the trading volume concentrated with any one exchange.”  Chatter about the solvency of Binance increased significantly after the collapse of FTX, and the exchange did suffer some outflows for a short period, though its business has stabilized since.

While that is true, another thing also true is the increase in crimes in the bear market. On today’s news, the ex-chief financial officer has pleaded guilty in court for embezzling more than $5 million from multiple special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) to trade meme stocks and cryptocurrencies. Going by the name Cooper Morgenthau, the former chief financial officer on Tuesday pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges in the U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan federal court Former Finance Exec Allegedly Committed Crimes According to Authorities, Morgenthau had embezzled over $1.2 million between June 2021 and August 2022 from African Gold Acquisition Corp, a blank check company, and underhanded the crime by forging its account statements, and spent or lost all of it in crypto and meme stock trading. Subsequent to that, the SEC said Morgenthau raised a total of $4.7 million from investors in SPACs, aliased as Strategic Metals Acquisition Corp, to cover his losses but lost most of the funds in trading crypto. At his scheduled April 25 sentencing, Morgenthau is said to face a likely jail sentence of about 6 to 7-1/4 years under recommended federal guidelines.

His Background in the African Gold company seems as though the illegal embezzlement of funds has been a recurring activity from Morgenthau. African Gold, which was established to buy a gold mining business and based in New York, had raised $414 million in a Feb. 2021 initial public offering. The SEC said the company eventually laid off Morgenthau last year in August after discovering his run away with funds and vendors declining to work for the company. According to African Gold, it terminated Morgenthau at the time after knowing about his “improper withdrawals” endeavor to conceal them. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan noted in a statement that given the pleading guilty, Morgenthau “acknowledged encroaching the trust that he owed to his public and private investors.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Inflows Spike, Is This Bearish For BTC?

The bullish news for Bitcoin/crypto is that the volatility is gone and the ""halvening"" event is on the (long-term) horizon, BUT…. The bearish news is much of the FTX contagion has yet to emerge. $13,000 on BTC has been my target for over a year; we could easily get another leg down before Easter. ""Up like a rocket, down like a rock"" so the ever-repeating story of markets goes. Now it is not a surprise that traditional investors find the idea of cryptocurrency disgusting. The internet was hard enough to swallow and then there suddenly appeared crazy magic money that made no sense and produced bazillion percent profits for - in Scooby-Doo parlance - ""those pesky kids."" Any seasoned investor has been trained on the ""South Sea Bubble,"" John Law’s ""Mississippi Bubble,"" the ""Tulip Mania;"" everyone knows that they come horribly unstuck. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is just the same. They are right. BUT… The South Sea Bubble was created by the emergence of the London Stock Exchange, which hasn’t looked back since, and represents a key infrastructure piece of the global economy. John Law’s Bubble was the introduction of ""fiat,"" which has had a checkered history since, but is still money as we know it and was about the commercialisation of a fairly large proportion of the USA, which today is obviously an economic and political powerhouse. As for the Tulip Mania, tulips in Holland are still a billion-dollar industry. I bought some last week, and they still look good in the vase in my hall. There are more examples of bubbles and crashes that lead to vast value, none more so than the Dotcom boom and crash. Meanwhile exotic securitisation derivatives march on even though they nearly sunk the global economy in 2008. So let’s not write off bubbles as manias that turn into something huge. Crypto will be no different. However, no one really cares about the long term, they want to know what Bitcoin is going to do tomorrow. The answer is, it will go up and down. The real call is what it is going to do in 2023 Here is the chart: Bitcoin price (ADVFN) So, this is the easiest way to speculate on what happens next: Bitcoin price (ADVFN) The bullish news is that the volatility is gone. The bearish news is there is a pent-up wall of FTX contagion that has yet to break to the surface. The recent missive from Gemini about the DCG, Genesis, Grayscale ""dynamic"" highlights just one of the potential debacles that can only press down on the values of crypto. The big bullish news is the upcoming ""halvening,"" which is when Bitcoin issuance halves. However, that isn’t until March 2024 and it might take until after that point to put upwards pressure on prices. So, the outlook is bearish in 2023…but wait, it could go two ways: BANG… up comes another FTX-like situation, down goes Bitcoin. Contagion rules and prices capitulate. That will be the bottom; a bottom that will see a purge of spicy CeFi platforms. Then, once a period of grief has elapsed, it will be time to accumulate. CeFi platforms hang on in, pretending that the rules don’t apply to them or covering up or simply ploughing on regardless until the inevitable outcome is they fail, or the market turns and they calmly and covertly trade their way to a better place. In this case, the market will grind down until mid-2024 when the ""halvening"" kicks in. The trend should show where that ends up and it could be well under $10,000. I still ""like"" $13,000, which has been my target for over a year now, but the price levels at the end of a bear market are highly uncertain. What to do? Self-custody. Keep your crypto in your own wallet; remember, not your keys, not your crypto. If you have to play on a CeFi platform don’t use it as a bank, and be able to run at a minute’s notice. Park your funds in USCoin (USDC-USD), but keep an eye on all stablecoins as nothing is sacred in crypto. Make sure the DeFi providers you use are actually ""Decentralised"" and not playing fast and loose with deposits in parallel. That is a tough job. If you smell any spicy behavior bail out of whatever it is. Prepare for re-entry so, come what may, you can get in or out when things kick off. Do not rely on a single provider of any kind of service. Better still, just wait until you hear it’s all over for crypto forever, any fool could see it was all a scam, this time it really is dead-dead... Make sure it’s a mainstream, mean front pager. Then make sure prices look really very low, wait for a couple of weeks, and get buying. I think we will get another leg down before Easter, then the call will be: is there another drop to $8,000? Until the purge of CeFi is complete the bottom won’t be in. Then it might be a simple case to buy Coinbase (COIN) at whatever price it trades at. However, in the end, loading up on Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH-USD) or a coin like Polygon (MATIC-USD) will be the way to go for the big win. … and then after it’s gone up like a rocket, remember it’s coming back down like a rock….again.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567856-bitcoin-and-crypto-what-expect-2023?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7054846.jpeg

The assets could later be subject to forfeiture proceedings, as Department of Justice cases against FTX’s former chief Sam Bankman-Fried and senior executives Gary Wang and Carolyn Ellison continue.  FTX, which filed for bankruptcy Nov. 11, has asked a federal court to weigh in on the ownership of about $450 million worth of Robinhood shares. The shares' ownership is disputed between bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi, Bankman-Fried, and FTX creditor Yonathan Ben Shimon.  One of the motions put forward was “related to Robinhood shares, which the federal government has also seized,” Department of Justice counsel Seth Shapiro told a Delaware bankruptcy court Wednesday.  “We believe that these assets are not property in the bankruptcy estate” or are subject to exemptions, meaning they don't have to be frozen like most FTX assets are, pending wind-up, Shapiro told Judge John Dorsey.  Shapiro said assets had been seized or were in the process of being seized from a number of banks, mentioning the name Silvergate, a lender closely tied to FTX, and could be later subject to civil or criminal forfeiture proceedings, a process to stop criminals benefiting from the proceeds of crime.  A Sullivan and Cromwell attorney appearing on a screen labeled Brian Glueckstein, who represents FTX, later said he wanted to clarify that these seizures were tied to the Department of Justice's ongoing prosecution of Bankman-Fried, rather than FTX's bankruptcy case as a civil matter.

Kasten, a partner at law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC Counsel.  Kasten told CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” on Tuesday that Bankman-Fried’s path will be difficult as he looks to defend himself in what for now is an upcoming October trial.  “It’s certainly a very tough road for Bankman-Fried to hoe,” Kasten said.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Pleads Not Guilty to Fraud, Conspiracy Charges  Bankman-Fried, the disgraced CEO of bankrupt exchange FTX, pleaded not guilty to eight counts of criminal charges on Tuesday.  While that plea was “entirely expected,” Kasten said, it doesn’t rule out the possibility that Bankman-Fried’s counsel is negotiating with federal prosecutors, and that a guilty plea could be in the works.  According to Kasten, Bankman-Fried’s challenge now is making a case that counters the guilty pleas of Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang. Close associates of Bankman-Fried, Ellison and Wang have agreed to fully cooperate with government prosecutors.  “It’s going to be a very tough task for Bankman-Fried to ultimately prevail at trial,” Kasten said. And while Bankman-Fried could be hoping for leniency, he may end up with a more “severe sentence” than he originally bargained for, Kasten added.  From the prosecutor's perspective, they may appear “confident” in their case against Bankman-Fried, said Kasten, “[but] there's always some risk to the government at trial.”  Kasten believe's Bankman-Fried’s defense is likely to lean on the former CEO’s media appearances, his public statements and his business aptitude as reasons to why “he was just out of his depth,” and did not intend to defraud FTX customers and investors.

42421406,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3XJ,1672862799,Who Are Sam Bankman-Fried's Politically Connected 'Wealthy Co-Conspirators'?,"FTX and Alameda Research founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was arraigned Tuesday in a Manhattan courtroom. Now attention turns to the legal process leading to an epic trial scheduled to start in October.  James A. Murphy is a securities lawyer who publishes content on legal and business issues arising in the world of digital assets and the metaverse, on Twitter @MetaLawMan and at www.MetaLawMan.io.  To recap, the indictment of SBF was made public on Dec. 13, 2022. It alleges that:  SBF stole funds from FTX customers and illegally transferred them to Alameda  SBF facilitated money laundering through FTX accounts  SBF violated campaign finance laws  See also: FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Formally Charged With Fraud  Understandably, the press focused on the big headline – that SBF had been accused of committing one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history. But is there a time bomb ticking away in the indictment?  Far less attention was paid to the last count in the indictment: The allegation that SBF conspired with others to violate campaign finance laws. It was well-documented that SBF had been a major contributor to mostly Democratic candidates (while his colleague, Ryan Salame, was a major Republican donor).  Still, the allegations of criminal violations of campaign finance laws were new and unexpected. Interestingly, these allegations go far beyond the basic fact that SBF used stolen customer funds to make these contributions.  Damian Williams, the United States Attorney in Manhattan provided some fascinating details about the campaign finance count in his press conference, including that SBF made illegal campaign contributions totaling in the “tens of millions of dollars.”  He further explained these enormous illegal contributions were disguised to look as if they were coming from, what Williams called, SBF’s “wealthy co-conspirators.” In other words, SBF used “straw donors” to conceal the source of some of his campaign contributions to evade federal contribution limits. That’s illegal.  If these bombshell allegations are proven, what would be the implications?  First, it is telling that prosecutor Williams used the words “wealthy co-conspirators” in his press conference. Generally, it is the one who reimburses the straw donors who gets prosecuted in these kinds of cases. But the federal campaign finance laws make clear that straw donors could themselves be criminally liable as well. This should send a shiver down the spines of these as-yet unnamed wealthy co-conspirators.  Which wealthy individuals would willingly agree to serve as straw donors for SBF? Will there be some recognizable names on that list?  Second, if the allegations are proven, it would mean that all published reports of how much SBF contributed to political campaigns in 2020 and in the 2022 midterms are significantly understated. It has been reported that SBF made over $40 million in campaign contributions. All we know now, according to prosecutors, is that SBF’s real political contribution totals are “tens of millions of dollars” higher than what was reported in the official campaign finance filings.  If the “tens of millions of dollars” is true, this case would go down as one of the largest straw donor campaign finance fraud cases of all time.  Third, the indictment alleges that SBF started making his illegal campaign contributions back in 2020. This is important because in 2020 SBF was contributing to Joseph Biden's presidential campaign. SBF contributed a total of $5.2 million to Biden 2020 – that we know about, according to OpenSecrets. The obvious question an inquiring journalist should be asking is: Did the Biden 2020 campaign also receive illegal campaign contributions through SBF’s network of “wealthy co-conspirators?”  Finally, if the allegations in the indictment are true, it would be logical to scrutinize SBF’s politically active mother, Barbara Fried. The indictment alleges that SBF’s illegal campaign contributions went, not only to individual candidates, but also to “independent expenditure committees,” like political action committees (PACs). Well, it turns out that Barbara Fried was the co-founder of a secretive super PAC called Mind the Gap that directed substantial contributions to Democratic candidates in this time period.  Could Barbara Fried’s PAC have been a recipient of some of her son’s illegal campaign cash? Would SBF have even embarked upon his massive campaign of legal and allegedly illegal political spending without his mother’s knowledge or involvement? Do these dots connect?  We won’t know the answers to these questions until prosecutor Williams decides to release the names of the mysterious “wealthy co-conspirators.” These names must be disclosed to SBF’s criminal defense counsel under federal criminal procedure, so one would expect that the prosecution would let the public in on this information as well. But there has already been an unusual level of secrecy around this prosecution.  See also: The Faulty Moral Universe of Sam Bankman-Fried | Opinion  Why don’t we just end the speculation right now?  I tend to think that Barbara Fried is not on the list of “wealthy co-conspirators.” Why? Because no prosecutor in their right mind would accept Barbara Fried’s signature on a guarantee of SBF’s “$250 million” personal recognizance bond if she was under investigation for participating in SBF’s campaign finance crimes. Prosecutors don’t typically accept guarantees of a defendant’s attendance at trial from someone who is suspected of being a co-conspirator with that defendant. They wouldn’t make an exception in this case, would they?  The millions of victims of the FTX fraud have been deceived enough.  So, I say, Prosecutor Williams, let’s see that list of SBF’s “wealthy co-conspirators.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,James A.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflows To Coinbase Register High Values As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a total of 20k BTC was transferred to Coinbase recently. The “exchange inflows” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently being transferred to an exchange (which, in this case, is Coinbase). When this metric’s value is high, investors send many coins to the exchange right now. Since one of the main reasons holders deposit to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this trend can have bearish implications for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, low values suggest investors aren’t making many deposits to the exchange. Such a trend could either be bullish or neutral for BTC, depending on whether the market-wide inflows are also down or not. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Withdraws $32M In LTC From Binance, Good Sign For Rally? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin inflows to the crypto exchange Coinbase over the last couple of months: Looks like the value of the metric has been high on several occasions in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange inflow to Coinbase has recorded many sizeable spikes in the last couple of weeks. However, as is apparent, there were no significant price moves following any of these large deposits. These spikes were not that big individually. So if the investors who made these transfers dumped their coins as soon as they completed the transactions, it would make sense that they couldn’t cause any volatility. However, the quant notes that there could be another scenario here. What if the holders responsible for these inflows haven’t pulled the trigger on the selling yet? It’s not unusual for investors to deposit their coins to exchanges in advance, waiting for the right movements in the price to exit. Related Reading: Brace For Impact? Bitcoin Open Interest RSI Forms Bearish Divergence All these transfers amounted to around 20,000 BTC entering into Coinbase’s wallets. At the current exchange rate, this stack would be worth around $336 million, which is certainly large enough to cause volatility in the crypto’s price if sold all at once. “Of course, if it were sold right after the deposit, the situation would be different, but you need to be careful if it hasn’t been sold yet,” cautions the analyst.

According to a report, the company successfully traded over $2 billion in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Solana Leads Crypto Market Gains, How Long Will This Continue? The trading desk is PO Street Capital, and its founder Darren Nguyen lives in an Australian suburb. The report claims that Nguyen and his company tried to keep a low profile and avoided attracting attention over the past two years. However, public records were discovered by journalists showcasing a $7 million profit in 2021 and a 1,400% profit when compared with 2020. The trading desk then scored a $460,000 profit as the crypto bear cycle ended. Crypto Trader Scores Record Profit In 2021 Bull Market In late 2020, Bitcoin revisited its previous all-time high at $20,000. In subsequent months, the cryptocurrency went on a massive bull run. By February 2021, the Bitcoin price was trading at $30,000 before moving upward and reaching a new all-time high north of $60,000. As the cryptocurrency doubled in price, the small Australian trading desk saw its profits swell. As BTC’s price traded to the upside, other cryptocurrencies saw similar or higher profits. The second crypto by market capitalization, Ethereum, rose from under $100 to an all-time high of $4,500. The report claims that PO Street Capital disclosed its performance with the Australian regulator in 2022. However, there is no record of its current profits or trading activity. With the Bitcoin and Ethereum price trending to the downside, an unfavorable macroeconomic condition, high inflation, and an overall downside trend in risk-on assets, PO Street Capital might have seen its profits dwindle. These conditions have led to the downfall of major companies in the nascent sector. From once-a-billion dollar hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and the second largest crypto exchange in the world, FTX, prominent companies have had to halt operations or declare bankruptcy protection.

Some, drawing on conspiratorial theories, have taken this as a sign that Bankman-Fried will pull strings with friends in high places to finagle his way toward acquittal.  The plea might well be strategic. Bankman-Fried might be holding out for an improved plea deal. Maybe he thinks a show of confidence can buttress public and investor faith in him or be enough to convince a jury of his innocence.  But an equally likely explanation for the decision to go to a trial in October is that Bankman-Fried and his allies are in a deep cocoon of delusion about the substance of the case. Regardless, he is exceedingly unlikely to win a verdict of innocence if things proceed to trial.

In fact, Bankman-Fried could earn a longer sentence at trial than through a plea deal. His willingness to go to court may even suggest he wasn't offered a deal for pleading guilty or was offered a very bad one, which wouldn't be surprising given the apparent strength of the criminal case against him.  Perhaps most importantly, going to trial means that Bankman-Fried’s story will be entered into public records in detail. Through the discovery and trial processes, we’re going to learn an immense amount, not only about Bankman-Fried, but also about the behavior of others at FTX and Alameda – and quite possibly about external allies who are still in the shadows.  In short, Bankman-Fried’s not guilty plea is not a sign of elite conspiracy. It’s a further symptom of his and his family’s profound disconnection from reality and a gift that should be celebrated.  Don’t worry: He’s (almost certainly) going down  There are many reasons it’s nearly inconceivable that Bankman-Fried will be found innocent when his case goes to trial. To cite just one, FTX and Alameda executives Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang will be cooperating with prosecutors, and Ellison has already said she committed crimes at Bankman-Fried’s direction. There’s also the very simple and convincing fact that FTX customers' money is gone – it must have gone somewhere, and Bankman-Fried was in charge.  That Bankman-Fried would choose to fight the charges against him, despite the immense preponderance of evidence, invites speculation about hidden forces and malign influence. Bankman-Fried’s political donations in particular may invite speculation that he expects friends in high places to apply pressure to get him off.  But at the risk of sounding like a Pollyanna, that’s not how things generally work in the U.S. justice system. There are other, subtler forms of corruption and influence peddling, but they are mostly exercised at the systemic level. Once you’re at the stage of a trial, there’s only so much even a powerful political machine can do to get a single individual off, short of a post-facto presidential pardon.  Further, while crypto-centric observers may see him as some exceptionally influential string-puller in Washington, the truth is that in the grand scheme of political clout, Sam Bankman-Fried is a Johnny-come-lately and a bit of a small fry. Compare him, for instance, with Kenneth Lay, CEO of Enron. Lay was very close with George W. Bush and other powerful politicians for years, but that didn’t protect him from a 2006 guilty conviction for Enron’s fraud – while his good friend W. was a sitting president.  Similarly, Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes cultivated some of the most powerful people on the planet in a very intimate way for nearly a decade – Henry Kissinger, a veritable Dark Lord of U.S. influence and power, sat on her board of directors. Compared with Holmes’ buddying up to Kissinger, Bankman-Fried’s seemingly close relationship to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler is inconsequential. And even Kissinger couldn’t help Holmes avoid a prison sentence.  See also: Do Kwon Is the Elizabeth Holmes of Crypto | Opinion  There are exceptions to America’s willingness to jail high-profile financial and business fraudsters. That includes many cases during the Obama administration in the wake of the Great Financial Crisis. John Corzine, a former U.S. Democratic senator from New Jersey, for instance, skated away with a fine from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for engaging in exactly the sort of malfeasance Bankman-Fried is accused of – stealing customer deposits.  Elite delusion  But if Bankman-Fried isn’t banking on help from powerful friends, why on earth would he roll the dice on a criminal trial? The answer is simple: He, and perhaps his parents, appear to be deeply delusional about his guilt.  That was manifested during his “speaking tour” after FTX’s collapse but before his arrest. Bankman-Fried defied the advice of his lawyers and spoke, if not frankly, then at least at length about his actions and state of mind up to and during the collapse of his crypto exchange. He declared again and again that he didn’t believe he had engaged in fraud.  That might sound absurd to those who have examined the details of the case, and Bankman-Fried was repeatedly evasive when pressed on specifics that seem to be clearly fraudulent. But it would be too simple to say that Bankman-Fried was merely putting on a front, that his protestations of innocence were entirely a conscious bit of four-dimensional chess.  Instead, I believe that Bankman-Fried is deep in a stew of fantasy, denial and double consciousness. I believe that much of this is rooted in his upbringing by parents who not only harped on the philosophy of ethics, but almost certainly showered baby Sam with affirmations of his own goodness and brilliance.  Sam Bankman-Fried’s self-image, in other words, is of a both gifted and good person. We are watching that clash with the reality of his behavior: that of a conniving, stimulant-addicted screw-up.  We saw signs, during hearings in the Bahamas, that his parents are struggling in similar ways to reconcile their idea of their son with the reality of his actions. Barbara Fried, Sam’s mother, was seen laughing at descriptions of her son as a criminal.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Was a 'Pathological Liar': Congressman  Even in the midst of conducting his fraud, Bankman-Fried likely believed that the corners he was cutting were justified by some larger set of good intentions. That mindset may have been reinforced by the ethos of ""Effective Altruism"" that he professed (however disingenuously).  No one, it’s often said, thinks of themselves as the villain. Resistance to that grim self-assessment may be strongest among those who have spent their lives surrounded by affirmations of privilege and virtue.  It is no tragedy that we will get to watch reality driven home to Sam Bankman-Fried by society’s ultimate educational institution: the justice system.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH,David Z.

42407210,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJkJC,1672853100,2023 Predictions: The Year of Web3 Pets,"Crouched at the ocean’s edge, her skeletal figure was a rude juxtaposition against the idyllic scenery of Seven Commandos Beach, a tiny island skirting the west Philippine archipelago. Once a tourist hotspot with hundreds of visitors dropping delicious pizza crusts and burger scraps daily, none had stepped foot there since the country closed over a year earlier.  Just a 10-minute boat ride from the place where my boyfriend and I had bunkered amid the pandemic, we had headed there for an afternoon for snorkeling and sunsets only to find a hungry old dog instead. Kneeling to meet her, I traced my fingers over her dirty, straw-like fur and nubby ribs. The animal was starving to death, but she somehow wagged her tail, and in that moment, we knew we weren’t leaving that island without her and her two babies in tow.  Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the Director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm based in Southeast Asia that represents play-to-earn sector clients including Animoca Brands, Yield Guild Games, Blockchain Game Alliance and others. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 package.  Newfound friends  Over the next year, we treated them as our own. We fed them only the best food, got them the veterinary attention they needed and spoiled them silly with squeaky toys and bones from the butcher and all the things that doggy dreams are made of. The whole exercise cost a bomb, but we didn’t care. It was high-COVID-19 and they provided us with a much-needed respite from lockdown life. Between tummy rubs, new tricks and those little things they do to let you know how much they love you, the time we spent with them was priceless.  It was always the plan to get them adopted. While we would have preferred to keep them, sadly, pet ownership doesn't gel well with a career that calls for constant global travel; I’m sure crypto people can relate. And now, with borders open, we are rarely at home. So, of course, I’m grateful that we were able to find forever homes for our rescue dogs, but saying goodbye was immensely difficult, and now there’s a giant gaping hole in my life where my pets used to be. Which may offer a clue about why I’ve become increasingly obsessed with my Crypto Unicorns.  Digital unicorns  Built on Polygon, Crypto Unicorns is a farming game of which I was first a player, and then later, an investor and adviser. I don’t know how many people care to hear my stories of farming nail seeds and picking up rainbow poop – but I tell them anyway.  Every chance I get, I’m whipping out my phone to bring up OpenSea to show off my collection of these adorable NFT (non-fungible token) pets. By now, I’ve collected way too many unicorns to remember each one by name, but I have my favorites. Like Pinstripe Atticus, a baby Double Mythic that I bred all by myself. In the game, they do the cutest things; like yesterday, Minty Raja was licking his crotch with his leg over his head, just like a cat. I’d never seen him do that before; developers must have pushed an update. I rushed to open QuickTime so that I could capture the precious moment, but I wasn’t quick enough.  Read more: It’s Been a Year Since NFTs Exploded. Where Are We Headed?  Back to the 1990s  Digital pets are obviously not new. Released in 1995 by video-game developer P.F. Magic, Petz was the world’s first. I got the PC game from Santa for Christmas that year and spent much of 1996 utterly petrified that my Chihuahua might run away if I didn’t give it enough attention. Then came Tamagotchi, and while classroom teachers were pushed to the limits of their patience with the beep-beep-beeping that kept kids hooked to their little egg device, others saw the benefit in learning about the responsibility that goes with caring for a living creature.  Starting out simple, later versions of these games allowed customization, training and breeding. With the advent of the internet, it was also possible to socialize virtual pets with other virtual pets and their meatspace owners. Massive online communities formed, run mostly by women, and they initiated all sorts of events external to the game, from art competitions to pet shows.  Recalling the reason about why they felt such a deep connection with their pixelated pets, countless articles, tributes and forum posts cite “a sense of ownership.” But this ownership was imaginary at best; these pet owners never owned anything at all, for their animals existed only within the confines of the platform on which they were built.  To put this into context: Imagine you bought a puppy from the pet store, but you can’t take it home. You can play with it anytime you like, you just have to go back into the pet store and interact with the animal inside its permanent enclosure. Most people will scoff at that, as they should! It’s ludicrous. But it underscores the difference between the Web2 and Web3 experience of ownership. Web2 pets never get out of the pet store, while Web3 pets are free to roam.  Read more: Jeff Wilser, Xinyi Luo - 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023  The Web3 experience  Web3, as a collection of blockchain-based software including cryptocurrencies and NFTs, facilitates the decentralization of internet-based platforms in a way that wasn’t possible before, so that digital pet owners can take personal control of their pets. As per our pet store analogy, an NFT pet lives in the owner’s self-controlled crypto wallet instead of being stuck inside a game.  Now, with your Web2-pet-owner-hat still on, imagine you showed up to the pet store only to find that it was closed. Or worse, there’s a sign on the door saying the store has shut permanently with your puppy inside. No matter how much time you spent together, no matter how many tricks you taught them, all you have left are memories.  This is the frustration and devastation experienced by players of Web2 games that go down for extended periods of time or shutter altogether, and the graveyard of games past is strewn with tombstones of virtual pet titles. Like Club Penguin, a Disney-owned social network that had 200 million users in 2013, but didn’t allow any of them to port over their game items or coins when a new site was launched in 2017.  The concept of ownership is fundamental to our relationship with pets. You give it a name. You are responsible for it. It relies on you for food, shelter, medicine and love. You protect it. You are its owner. And wherever property rights are critical, there is an excellent use case for Web3. So it isn’t surprising that there are already loads of pet projects popping up with NFTs at the core.  Different games  In Crabada, a game on the Avalanche blockchain, you can be a keeper of fierce, fighting crustaceans. In Nyan Heroes, an upcoming Battle Royale Shooter on the Solana network, you can own an adorable kitty and its deadly guardian robot and feel good about it, since the game’s developer plans to donate part of its revenue to animal charities. And then there’s NFT games like Petaverse and Digital Dogs that combine blockchain with other technology such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality and extended reality to deliver new ways of interacting with virtual pets.  Many PFP (profile picture) projects have pet-like qualities, too, such as Pudgy Penguins, Cool Cats, CrypToadz, Sup Ducks and Moonbirds to name a few.  Digital property rights  So if digital property rights are so important to digital pet owners, why haven’t they demanded them before? Virtual pet communities were always tech-forward. Taking the Petz community as an example, members went to lengths to learn and hand code HTML to build their own sites (with blinking and marquee scrolling text and all) to display their virtual floofs. This is remarkable because it was just everyday enthusiasts with the passion and drive to create. There was no drag-and-drop; it was pre-WordPress, pre-Facebook and MySpace, even before GeoCities.  Super zealots even learned to reverse engineer their pets, playing into the binary code of the project to edit their hexadecimal codes and alter everything from body shape to coloring to fur texture. Sometimes, hexers on-sold their modified breeds, but there was no way to protect or prove the uniqueness of a digital pet and no way to prevent its .pet files from being freely shared for anyone to download. If you wanted a one-off, you just had to trust that it wouldn’t be resold. But realistically, there were countless Petz clones proliferating all across the world.  NFT pets  NFTs could have solved this problem of authenticity and provenance, but they took off only over the past few years. Virtual pets have been around for nearly three decades.  The earliest advocate for NFT pets that I met was Jeffrey “Jihoz” Zirlin, co-founder of Sky Mavis and Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis just launched Axie Core, a new in-game experience designed to strengthen the emotional connection between owners and their Axies. That had been a long time coming.  During the first chat I ever had with Jihoz, in August 2020, he talked a lot about his vision for Axies to be thought of as virtual pets. He had a strong rationale, too, pointing to the amount that people spent on real-world pets – the global pet-care market is projected to grow to $326 billion in 2028 from $223 billion in 2021 – and how part of that spending could be captured by the virtual pet market since people were living more and more of their lives online.  But at the time, few people knew what an NFT was, let alone owned one, and most who got into Axie from 2020 onward (me included) thought of Axies less like pet ponies and more like workhorses meant for hard labor. We were coming off the back of DeFi (decentralized-finance) summer, and everyone was all about yield farming. Then COVID-19 hit, destroying livelihoods, particularly for those in countries where government relief was limited, and millions were left desperate for income. So play-to-earn (P2E) ended up being the thing that catapulted Axie into the mainstream.  Belly-up for play-to-earn  In hindsight, the original P2E model was unsustainable. Players were incentivized to extract more from the game than they put in, leading to hyperinflation of the game’s currency and eventual collapse of the virtual economy. Opportunistic players cleared out once there were no more easy gains to be made, and developers refocused on building fun-first blockchain games to attract players who could spend big (as opposed to seeking payouts). Add to this the reckoning that crypto is down bad (as is global macros) and will be for a while. Anyone who was in it purely for financial gain has fled for greener pastures and the only NFT folk still holding on are either long crypto or subscribed to the “would you still love it if it went to zero?” mantra.  Jay Chang, co-founder of Genopets, a move-to-earn game on Solana where players nurture their very own NFT spirit animal, told me he’s observed that players of his game are motivated to invest in upgrading their virtual pets. To level up and evolve a Genopet, players complete daily quests like taking their mobile phone – I mean, virtual pet – out for walkies. A pedometer counts the number of steps and converts them to energy points in the game. According to Chang, the majority of players opt to reinvest those points into improving their pet.  “Since our beta started, around 65% of our daily active users consistently choose to use their daily energy earned to upgrade their pet rather than taking an on-chain action to convert it to a token and be ‘paid to play’ like with typical Web3 games,” Chang told me via Telegram, adding that pet-care games are a nostalgic game loop that are proven to appeal to a very wide demographic. “NFT pets are just a modern twist in that players can own the economy,” he said.  Web3 pet owners tick all the boxes: They care about property rights, they put more value in than they extract, and they aren't abandoning their beloved NFTs just because of a dip in the market. For these reasons, they will also place significantly higher expectations on the projects that they back and won't hesitate to air their pet peeves over the current lack of true ownership, security, transparency, good governance, interoperability and composability in this sector.  An awkward transition phase  Right now, we’re in an awkward transition phase where there are lots of big claims going around about Web3’s ultimate utility. But in reality, NFT ownership is flimsy and each one of our virtual playgrounds is a self-contained silo. Add to this, what “utility” we’ve seen so far is non-scalable Web2-esque partnerships and permissioned integrations that don’t exploit Web3’s true potential.  Big strides in innovation come about when there’s big enough groundswell to demand it. Like when CryptoKitties broke the Ethereum blockchain or when Axie Infinity made more revenue in protocol fees than Bitcoin, Ethereum and the 11 next dapps (decentralized applications) combined. Virtual pets have mass-market appeal – more than skins, weapons or art – and pet owners will drive Web3 forward by putting their money where their NFT is. Like when the Bored Ape Yacht Club flipped CryptoPunks because the former delivered better intellectual property rights, allowing the IP of each NFT to be managed by its owner.  In Web3, we talk a lot about earning rewards, but the premise is almost always financial. This is a missed opportunity because the most rewarding experiences of our lives tend to be driven by emotion, not by money. If something of financial value is lost, in theory it can be replaced or compensated for. The same cannot be said for things of a non-fungible nature with which we have a relationship. Like a rescue dog. Or a Crypto Unicorn. Where this type of connection exists, we care about the concept of ownership because we recognize these creatures as a part of ourselves.  And, as we look back on a year of carnage and heartbreak throughout the crypto industry, I think we could all use a friend to keep us company throughout the long, cold winter.

42414726,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBFTHx,1672852301,TradFi Fights for Tougher Crypto Rulebook in Wake of FTX Collapse,"International plans to break up major crypto conglomerates appear to have been given a boost by the collapse of FTX, with allegations of misuse of funds revealing regulators’ worst fears to be true.  Now major traditional finance (TradFi) players are egging on international standard setters to be yet bolder in tackling perceived excesses by the crypto sector – despite warnings from Binance and Coinbase that they could end up limiting the benefits of blockchain technology, documents published Wednesday reveal.  The companies were responding to a consultation opened in October 2022 in which the Financial Stability Board (FSB) proposed a “comprehensive” international crypto rulebook covering financial stability and consumer protection – just as the standard-setter sought to do for TradFi in the wake of the 2008 crisis.  The Financial Stability Board seems to have been prescient when, last year, it warned that major crypto companies face conflicts of interest – saying that, for example, a crypto exchange could block out competition from rival market makers operating on its platform.  Just a few weeks later, CoinDesk revealed a blurring of lines between FTX and its supposedly separate trading arm Alameda Research. That snowballed into allegations of a misuse of customer funds, and that Alameda enjoyed an unlimited line of credit.  The company has now filed for bankruptcy protection, and former chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering and wire fraud in a New York courtroom.  Coming after the collapse of crypto lender Celsius Network, stablecoin issuer Terra and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, the turbulent year in crypto has only given extra grist to the mill of TradFi players who want crypto actors to play by the same rules.  “The case for extending the regulatory perimeter is now clear-cut … the regulatory approach must be comprehensive,” said U.K. bank Standard Chartered in its response to the FSB consultation.  The “egregious examples of the FTX collapse and others” show the need to clarify how to segregate and protect customer assets, TradFi lobby group the Institute for International Finance told the FSB.  “Given recent market developments in the crypto-asset ecosystem and the uncertainty brought by the collapse of key market players, we support global regulators and standard setters in their mission to bring order and financial stability to crypto-asset markets,” said the Global Financial Markets Association, which represents capital market players such as investment banks.  According to the World Federation of Exchanges, whose members include Nasdaq, the Intercontinental Exchange and the London Stock Exchange Group, the FSB should even “strengthen its stance in requiring separation of activities,” ensuring the same standards apply as would for TradFi players, when crypto companies simultaneously operate platforms, execute trades, and hold or issue cryptocurrency.  Established crypto players, meanwhile, have warned the FSB not to throw the baby out with the bathwater – and to respond to crypto risks without impeding the benefits of its innovation.  Crypto risks “need to be considered properly, and therefore require tailoring and bespoke regulation,” said Binance in its response, adding that segregation of functions would need to proceed differently even if they are legally similar to TradFi services.  They are joined by rival crypto exchange Coinbase, which said it “would be a mistake to call for the separation of activities” merely because that’s done for TradFi services that use “inferior technology.”  Combining exchange services with custody would allow the benefits of real-time settlement without meaningful extra risks, said the submission, introduced by Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad.  The FSB has said it wants to produce a final report in July, forming the kernel of a global system of crypto laws, and there seem to be scant indication that it will fully soften its position before then.  In December, the FSB, whose members include officials from ministries, central banks and regulators in 24 jurisdictions including the U.S., U.K. and European Union said it had drawn preliminary lessons from the FTX collapse, and reiterated the risks posed by major crypto conglomerates.  The Indian finance minister, set to chair the meeting of the world’s twenty largest economies that steers the FSB’s work, has also vowed to make new crypto laws a priority.

The market had seen renewed interest following the holidays which led to a small recovery here and there especially for the large players but Solana had been able to break completely from the trend and record double-digit gains in the last couple of days. What Is Driving Solana’s Growth? Despite being at the forefront of massive FUD that has dragged its price down toward two-year lows, Solana has now been able to recover a good amount of gains over the last few days. While the comments from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin in support of the blockchain had helped, there was another factor pushing the price higher. Related Reading: Santiment Paints Bullish Picture For XRP, But This May Not Be The Case A new meme coin known as BONK had graced the Solana ecosystem and after being airdropped to holders of major NFT projects, the price of the meme coin had soared. The resulting gains would see investors FOMO into the cryptocurrency and since they needed to trade on the Solana network, the price of SOL had surged given all of the new attention it was receiving. In two days, SOL ballooned to become one of the best performers in the space coming into the new year. It is up over 16% in the last 24 hours alone and the price of the digital asset has moved from the loss territory into the green over the last week. It is now sitting at almost 37% gains for investors over this time period, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Can SOL Hold The Gains? Right now, the growth of SOL in the market is still largely driven by the FOMO triggered by the BONK meme coin. Since the hype around this coin has been waxing strong, it is expected that interest will remain high among investors, thereby sustaining the growth trend recorded by Solana. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sees Sharp 3.59% Drop However, it is important to keep in mind that the BONK cryptocurrency is largely driven by hype, and just like any other meme coin, it is expected that this hype would die down at some point. Now, once this happens, the decline in interest would also significantly impact the price of SOL, dragging it down along with it. That is unless something else comes up to drive the price of SOL higher. It is also expected that some profit-taking would begin, where investors would begin to dump SOL to claim the gains already being seen. This, as well, will contribute to a wind-down, and a downward correction would follow. But this correction is not expected to claim more than 10% of current profits given that the price of SOL is now trading above its 20-day moving average of $12.3. SOL is changing hands at $13.72 at the time of this writing. It has overtaken Shiba Inu to become the 15th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $5.04 billion.

42414725,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBFT22,1672850500,Ethereum Builder ConsenSys and AMD SPAC Plows on Despite 95% of Shares Being Redeemed,"W3BCLOUD, a joint venture between chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Ethereum builder ConsenSys, says it will plow on with plans to go public, despite investors opting to redeem 95% of the shares in the deal with blank-check company Social Leverage Acquisition Corp. (SLAC).  Billed as a decentralization-promoting alternative to Amazon Web Services, the W3BCLOUD-special-purpose acquisition company combination was expected to bring $345 million to the balance sheet of the combined business and value it at about $1.25 billion. The special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, will carry on with just $16.6 million remaining in its coffers for now, following the redemption vote, which was filed over the Christmas period.  “We remain very excited about the opportunity to merge with SLAC and become a public company,” a W3BCLOUD spokeswoman said via email.  Last year, which turned out to be something of a nightmare for the cryptocurrency industry, saw a number of high-profile crypto firms canceling plans to go public through a merger with a SPAC. Stablecoin firm Circle and crypto exchange Bullish bowed out last month and trading platform eToro and bitcoin miner PrimeBlock terminated their plans during the summer.  The W3BCLOUD SPAC also sought a three-month extension, giving those involved in the deal until May 17 to raise enough capital to meet the $150 million minimum cash condition to go public. (The initial announcement in August mentioned commitments for $40 million from ConsenSys and a further $10 million investment agreement with AMD, plus the intention to raise up to $100 million in capital post-announcement.)  “As markets got tough last year, deals took longer to get done and SPACs started nearing the end of their lives,” said Alan Annex, co-chairman of law firm Greenberg Traurig’s global corporate practice. “The requirement in the charter, designed to protect the shareholders’ money, says you can't extend the life of the SPAC without offering people the option to get their money back at the time you offer that extension.”  Some of the SPACs today that are experiencing high redemption rates may involve situations where the target wants to go public for reasons other than just raising money, Annex added.  “When it comes to high redemption rates, it’s not that people don't like the company, just that they don't like it at $10 a share,” he said.  W3BCLOUD aimed to dilute the high concentration of Ethereum blockchain nodes being hosted in data centers owned by giants like Amazon Web Services. The company’s goal is “advancing decentralization of the hardware layers of Web3,” ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin said in a statement.

The macroeconomic environment is waking up, shaking things across all asset classes. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers In Massive Loss As 80% of Staked ETH Is In The Red As of this writing, the Bitcoin price trades at $16,800 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the crypto top 10, BTC is lagging behind Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Cardano. These cryptocurrencies are positively reacting to the start of 2023. Bitcoin Price Aims For Higher Levels Per a recent report from the trading desk QCP Capital, institutions are returning to action and allocating capital in Gold and other assets. The precious metal has seen a 15% rally in the past 60 days and keeps trending upwards. The trading desk believes institutions are allocating into “alternative assets” or stores of value. The Bitcoin price is yet to benefit from this trend, but the crypto market is recording some profits. In particular, the non-fungible token space. This sector is coming back to life after months of declining activity. Popular NFT collections experienced 2 to 3x profits in late 2022 and are likely to maintain the trend. QCP Capital noted Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price action: (…) in line with Gold and NFTs, BTC and ETH are playing catch up to some extent at the start of the year. Despite the mini rally, BTC is still trading in an extremely tight falling wedge – with 18k the key breakout level to the topside. If the Bitcoin price can flip $18,000 and trend higher on the back of institutional allocation to alternative assets, the cryptocurrency could reclaim higher levels. The trading desk points to $28,000 as a critical level to watch. This level is the neckline of the “Head and Shoulders” pattern formed by BTC in the past two years. In addition, $28,000 has confluence with the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level, meaning many players will keep an eye on it. What Could Operate As An Obstacle For Bitcoin In the short term, the Bitcoin price is seeing resistance at its current levels. Analyst Caleb Franzen claims that BTC is likely to continue seeing resistance around these prices and higher. Related Reading: Brace For Impact?

7038175,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514754,1672842641,Ethereum Stakers In Massive Loss As 80% of Staked ETH Is In The Red,"The bear market has resulted in multiple losses for individuals and even large entities, and according to recent data shared by crypto analytics site, Dune analytics, the majority of all ETH stakers are in the loss while fewer stakers remain in the money. The reason behind the result of more losses than profit is due to the market conditions starting in 2021 after the Ethereum Beacon chain was launched, to the present. ETH had reached a new all-time high (ATH) but has also fallen by more than 50% from the ATH. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Key Trend is Forming and Swift Recovery Could Occur Weekly Staked ETH Fall To Lowest Levels as Only 20% Of ETH Staked Is In Money The January 4 published data further showed that 80% of ETH staked are currently recording losses. The stakers who happen to be part of the 20% still in money are those that staked ETH at prices lower than the current levels. Per the data, a significant chunk of staked ETH was staked when ETH was still in the $600 price range — this dates back to December 2020 when the Beacon Chain was launched. Though ETH has since increased to a point where it’s now 50% higher than the 2020 price level, 80% of the currently staked ETH was staked at prices equal to or above $1,200. Following the massive losses recorded in staked ETH, the amount of weekly staked ETH has seen a sharp decline with fewer ETH staked since the last quarter of 2022. Over the past week, only a total of 25,000 ETH has been staked. Prior to the extreme market conditions, figures of roughly 150,000 ETH were being staked per week. Should ETH continue into a downward movement, chances are there could be massive withdrawals from ETH staking contracts when a withdrawal mechanism is implemented later this year. Considering The Long Term Perspective Another narrative worth considering is the long-term perspective. Given the fact that most stakers already had an initial idea of keeping their ETH for the long term, they might as well turn a blind eye to the current price levels of Ethereum. Besides, staking ETH directly or through an exchange would usually involve a committed two-year lockup period. For context, 15.9 million ETH is currently staked, representing 13.2% of the entire supply, according to Dune data reports. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Relatively Muted, Bulls Still Aim Key Upside Break However, even with the dip that seems to be never-ending, there are still hopes for Ethereum and even other altcoins. As of the time of writing, ETH is up by over 3% in the last 24 hours with a trading volume of $5.2 billion over the same time period. Furthermore, a reversal is expected to happen, given the sharp upwards movements in what seems to be a false move.

Bitcoin Open Interest RSI Forms Bearish Divergence,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin open interest RSI is currently forming a pattern that can lead to a short-term correction in the asset’s value. Bitcoin Open Interest 14-Day RSI Has Been Climbing Up Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a short-term bearish correction might soon take place for BTC. The “open interest” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts currently open on derivative exchanges. The metric takes into account both long and short contracts. When the value of this metric goes up, it means investors are opening more contracts on derivative exchanges right now. Such a trend could result in higher volatility for the crypto’s price as it implies leverage is increasing in the market. On the other hand, decreasing values suggest holders are getting liquidated or are closing down their futures contracts currently. Naturally, this could lead to a more stable price of BTC due to the lesser leverage. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Withdraws $32M In LTC From Binance, Good Sign For Rally? Now, the relevant metric in the context of the current discussion isn’t the open interest itself, but its 14-day RSI. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that keeps track of the speed and direction of changes in any metric’s value over a specified period. The below chart shows the trend in the 14-day RSI of the Bitcoin open interest over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have seen some rise in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the quant has highlighted the relevant regions of the trend for the Bitcoin open interest RSI (14). It would appear that whenever the RSI has risen while the BTC price has been moving sideways or downwards, a bearish divergence has formed for the crypto, and its price has undergone a correction. Related Reading: This Needs To Happen For Bitcoin And Ethereum To See A Bullish 2023 There have been other instances of a rising open interest RSI in the past year, but all those were accompanied by a rise in the price itself (and not consolidation or decline) so the same pattern never applied to them.

7035250,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514743,1672839009,Cardano (ADA) Price Soars By 5% As Buying Pressure Mounts,"The Cardano (ADA) token marked a two-year low at $0.239 as recently as December 30 but has since experienced a sustained upswing that catapulted the price to $0.264 at press time. Within the last 24 hours, ADA is recording an increase in price of around 5%, with a trading volume of around $250 million. However, a look at the 1-day chart reveals that Cardano is far from out of the woods. The ADA price has been in a falling trend channel since mid-August 2022. Since early December alone, the ADA token has fallen 25%. While the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is an initial target at $0.291, ADA needs another boost above $0.33 to break out of the bearish trend. Thus, today’s move could mark a budding momentum for the bulls. The MACD indicator was showing a bullish crossover a few days ago, suggesting buying pressure is building up. Related Reading: Cardano Enters 2023 With A Bang, But ADA Still Bearish In The Short Term Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 46 and is now in neutral territory after spending much of the second half of December in oversold territory. Looking at the 4-hour chart, Cardano has seen a major rejection at the key resistance zone of $0.266-$0.271. For ADA investors, the mark could be the first major step to tackling the $0.28 level. After that, the most crucial resistance would be waiting in the $0.291-$0.30 zone. Only if Cardano manages a breakout, the attention could move to the higher time frame, setting up a final strike against the bearish trend. Cardano Whales And DeFi Activity Could Spur The Price Some upside to the ADA price may have been provided by the growth of the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. After hitting a low of $48.95 million on January 1, Total Value Locked (TVL) has risen again today to $52.53 million according to data from DeFiLlama. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Extremely Undervalued? On-Chain Data Suggests So Some of the leading decentralized financial protocols on the Cardano network have seen an uptick in activity. Within the top 7 decentralized applications (apps), all have seen at least a 3.5% increase over the last 24 hours in terms of TVL. With +21.5%, Lending Pond leads the growth over this period, but also over the last month (+50%). Another reason for the uptick in price could be larger ADA investors. WhaleStats data shows that large BSC holders also have a keen interest in buying Cardano (ADA). ADA purchases are within the top 10 of the 4,000 largest BSC whales in the last 24 hours. In addition, the largest BSC whales currently hold 19.9 million ADA, which is worth $5.19 million and represents 0.68% of the total supply.

Bankman-Fried, who is facing eight criminal charges including wire fraud and campaign-finance violations, pleaded not guilty to all charges via his lawyer at a hearing in federal court in New York. The former CEO of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX made his second appearance in the courthouse on Tuesday. At his first appearance last week, he was released on a personal recognizance bond, and shortly after, flew back to his parents' home in California. His not guilty plea was expected, according to an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal.  Bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) will shut down 37,000 mining rigs it hosts for Celsius Mining. Core turned the machines off after moving to reject its contract to host the equipment. The two firms have been engaged in litigation over the 2020 deal, which Core Scientific says is costing it $2 million in revenue per month. Both companies are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy: Celsius Mining filed last July, along with its parent company, Celsius Network, and Core filed last month.  Shiba Inu-themed BONK tokens are yielding nearly 1,000% for Solana liquidity providers. Bonk, which was issued on Dec. 25, has returned 2,220% to traders in the past week, with a 150% rise in the past 24 hours alone. The token was airdropped to Solana NFT (non-fungible token) communities and creators, which led to quick hype and trading volumes for the token. Early investors aren’t the only ones gaining, however. Liquidity pools on Solana-based decentralized exchanges such as Orca have attracted over $20 million in volume for trading pairs involving BONK.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's perpetual futures funding rates going back to late October.  The recent positive flip in funding rates suggests investors with long positions are paying short sellers to keep their bullish positions open.

7033814,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567607-bitcoin-more-rough-waters-ahead?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1672837200,Bitcoin: More Rough Waters Ahead,"Summary Bitcoin needed to hold $16K in order to finish the current bearish cycle. Breaking $16K opened the door to lower levels into 2023. Micro action off the November low also supports lower lows in the future. Produced by Ryan Wilday with Avi Gilburt and Jason Appel In previous articles , I saw $16K as a key level for Bitcoin (BTC-USD). This level stands between a more immediate end to the current bear, now running over 13 months, and a bear market that could extend well into 2023. In Elliott Wave analysis, the $16K is the 50% retrace of the supposed third wave off the 2018 low. That third wave started with the ""COVID crash"" bottom struck on March 13th, 2020. That retrace is where a reliable fourth wave should hold, before commencing the fifth wave. In Bitcoin's case, I expected that fifth to take Bitcoin into $125K. I show what this count would look like in the chart below with the blue box representing this support region. This has been my primary count since late 2021 but it looks like I will be pushed to follow my alternate discussed below. Bitcoin, weekly chart (Motivewave) Bitcoin spiked below $16K by about $500 on November 21st and quickly rallied. Normally, I can accept a spike below a key level if a rally soon commences, as is the case with Bitcoin on that day. However, since then, that reversal has rallied correctively by Elliott Wave standards, suggesting that another break of $16K should come in the near future. Elliot Wave analysis looks for five waves off a low to suggest that a trend can change. Determining whether a structure is five waves or not is not just based on visual analysis alone. It also involves evaluating structure using Fibonacci retraces and projections to measure the proportional relationship of each sub-wave to another. The details of this method are beyond the scope of this article. But essentially, I have to consider the move off the November 21st low as three waves. This is indicated by the ABC structure into the December 4th high, marked with the label Circle A. The subsequent high on December 14th was made in three waves, so is viewed as a ""high B"" that breaks above the end of the A wave. This sort of B wave is common in crypto. Counting the December 4th high as A means there should be a C wave into the $18,300 region to complete wave IV, before Bitcoin drops to $13,500. However, I am also tracking a secondary, more immediate bearish count where we have seen all of wave iv where the black count indicates ((B)). This scenario became a solid potential when Bitcoin formed an impulsive move down from Y/((B)). This indicates an immediate move down $13,500 is possible, and it would be confirmed by a drop through $15,875 from here. I rendered this potential in red. Bitcoin, bearish micro (Motivewave) Bullish Alternative Both of the above scenarios are ultimately bearish, one with an upward detour first. I can come up with a bullish view that is low probability. This would require five waves up to $19,500, indicated below. This structure would be called a diagonal and is valid in reversals as a wave 1, or the end of a move in the form of a wave 5. The sub-waves of such structures usually take on an ABC structure, as I've shown above. However, these structures are not reliable for aggressive trading until all five waves and the subsequent wave 2 hold. I mention this only so you know where I am clearly wrong about Bitcoin making new lows in the coming weeks to months. Bitcoin, bullish alternative (Motivewave) A New Primary Count Now that we have spent time on the microstructure, we have to look back at the weekly chart. As stated, breaking down to $13,500 invalidates my primary long-term view, so we need to revisit it. In short, the current bear market should go on for many more months. And, I have to adopt an alternate count I have considered as my new primary view. Breaking to $13,500 indicates the top in 2021 is a B wave top, in a large-scale flat correction that started when Bitcoin topped at close to $18K in December 2017. From the perspective of Elliott Wave analysis, the bear market in Bitcoin that moved it downward in 2018 never ended. It had three phases: A bearish A wave in 2018 A bullish B wave from 2019 to mid-2021 A bearish C wave from mid-2021 until the present. In this view, Bitcoin shouldn't finish this bear market in 2023. Ideally, it starts a rally after a bottom near $13,500 into the $20K-$25K region before finding a final bottom near $3K-$6K. After this bear market is over, I expect a multi-year rally to a minimum of $160K. And a wildly bullish, multi-year rally to $1.2M is possible. In this second view, though, there should be many mini-bear markets that correct 50% or more. Those potentials will be discussed in detail in future articles when we have a meaningful bottom. Bitcoin, Primary (using BraveNewCoin Index) (Tradingview.com) What About the Halving? This discussion requires that I address Bitcoin cycles, which can be called ""halving cycles"". Halving is the cyclical 50% reduction in the Bitcoin block rewards for miners. The next halving is estimated to occur on March 28, 2024. On average, Bitcoin started a new bullish cycle 15 months before halving as the reduction in issuance sparked interest. We are in that window now. See: Bitcoin Halving Clock I watch this cycle with curiosity. However, I'd challenge the expectation the mass market has for this cycle with a couple of considerations: Halving has occurred four times in Bitcoin's past. That's many data points too few for creating a robust strategy. Much of the Bitcoin community focuses on these cycles, and when too many expect a market event, it often doesn't happen. I am not saying a new bullish cycle can't start imminently. To the contrary, I watch these cycles closely. However, I want to see price action confirm the cycle plays out once again. Tactically Speaking What you do with this information should be based on your abilities, your risk tolerance, and core intent. I am both a long-term investor and a swing trader. Occasionally, I trade intraday. At the time of writing, in my short-term accounts, I am short Bitcoin using futures, as well as BITO options. However, in my long-term wallets, I am slowly accumulating. I have made the most in Bitcoin by accumulating near major cyclical lows, but I never assume I will catch the lowest tick. I just make sure the amount I accumulate fits a very small portion of my monthly cash flow. It may seem foolhardy to start to accumulate when I expect to see $6K. Again, I emphasize that I am keeping additions to my portfolio small and my short-term trading with futures offers a partial hedge of the Bitcoin held in wallets. If you want to take this tactic, expect lower lows and size right to support your emotional and financial comfort. In Conclusion To wrap it up, $16K was a very key level for Bitcoin to hold - one at which it should have put in a major bottom. While it has reversed from just below that level, which would have been acceptable, the current rally is not confidence-inspiring. So, I am looking lower, possibly as low as $6K. But that hasn't stopped me from accumulating slowly. I consider these cyclical bottoms as opportunities of a lifetime - except that Bitcoin has given me several in my trading life. I'll keep it slow for now, but when we have a firm reversal, I'll play the bullish side more aggressively.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567607-bitcoin-more-rough-waters-ahead?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7033814.jpeg

42414734,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBFTiU,1672836434,"Ether-Bitcoin Ratio on Bullish Path After Triangle Breakout, Trader Says","The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio could rally toward a two-month high, according to Lewis Harland, a portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital.  That's because the ratio has broken out of a multi-month triangle pattern, often called a wedge, indicating a bull victory in the prolonged tug-of-war with bears.  ""ETH/BTC has broken out of its multi-month wedge to the upside,"" Harland told CoinDesk, adding that the breakout has opened the doors for a rally toward the early December high of 0.07636 and early November highs of nearly 0.078.  The chart shows ether-bitcoin ratio has blasted through the upper end of the three-month triangle or wedge identified by trendlines connecting highs registered in September, October and December and lows hit in October, November and December.  Triangles occur when both bulls and bears are unwilling or unable to lead the price action, leading to volatility compression. Hence, an eventual breakout or breakdown often brings a big bullish or bearish move.  In other words, ETH/BTC looks set for a notable rally.  ""It may be we see a 'bears in disbelief' rally for ETH over the coming weeks,"" Harland said, citing the Ethereum network's upcoming Shanghai upgrade that will open withdrawals of staked ether and expected reduction of rollup fees for users after the implementation of EIP4844 as bullish catalysts for the cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin, meanwhile, could continue to lag ether due to miner selling.  ""Miners are becoming more distressed, indicated by higher hashrate where the market may become concerned miners selling inventory to remain operational and competitive,"" Harland noted.

42410864,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsCWt,1672835400,Ethereum in 2023: Here’s What to Look Forward To,"Staked ether withdrawals are imminent  This will be the most pressing issue that Ethereum developers will tackle.  After September’s Merge, when Ethereum switched its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), the network began to use validators instead of miners to approve and add blocks to the Ethereum blockchain. Prior to the Merge, validators began staking 32 ether (ETH) on the PoS Beacon Chain in order to participate in the block validation process.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  But validators were made aware before they joined the network that their staked ETH and any accrued rewards would remain locked up until Ethereum’s next upgrade, known as Shanghai, which is now set for March.  Those that have been accruing rewards, some as early as December 2020 when the Beacon Chain went live, will finally be able to cash out their stake.  “Withdrawals are as good as done,” Marius Van Der Wijden, a software developer at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk. All that is left to do is to test the code that enables withdrawals, which “should be mostly done by February/March” Van Der Wijden added.  Read more: Ethereum Developers Target March 2023 for Release of Staked Ether  Proto-danksharding this fall, perhaps?  Another item that Ethereum developers are hoping to address is “proto-danksharding,” which derives from “sharding.”  Sharding is a method that splits up the network across several chains, or “shards,” in a way to make blockchain more scalable. Developers have compared sharding to adding new lanes to the highway; more cars are able to make use of that highway and can (ideally) travel down that road quicker as a result of less traffic.  The same goes for Ethereum transactions: Shards will increase the amount of network activity the blockchain can process, therefore decreasing gas fees and allowing for faster transaction speeds.  Danksharding takes this same principle of splitting a network into shards, but instead of providing more space for transactions, it provides more space for “blobs” of data, allowing Ethereum to process more data.  An ambitious endeavor, Ethereum developers agreed it would be too ambitious for it to go live with staked ETH withdrawals in March. And since their priority is to allow stakers to withdraw their ETH ASAP, developers agreed to push proto-danksharding to an upgrade scheduled for the fall.  Parithosh Jayanthi, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk that he thinks that [proto-]danksharding will be “the most exciting thing devs will work on in 2023.” Jayanthi also added that proto-danksharding has “the potential to onboard millions of users and truly provide scalability to Ethereum.”  Read more: Scaling Ethereum Beyond the Merge: Danksharding  Dealing with Ethereum’s censorship problem and centralization  The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctioned Ethereum mixer program Tornado Cash in August 2022. Ever since then, Ethereum developers have had to deal with what that means. Some have argued that validators that are not under U.S. jurisdiction do not have to comply with the sanctions. Others are confused about what kinds of blockchain activities are allowed under OFAC’s rules.  Currently, 65% of blocks that have made it onto the Ethereum blockchain over the past 24 hours censored Tornado Cash transactions, and members of the community have tried to reverse the course of increased censorship.  Read more: Is Ethereum’s Censorship Problem Taking a Turn?  As of now, members of the Ethereum ecosystem view OFAC compliance in different ways. Some have interpreted the sanctions as barring them from adding Tornado Cash transactions to the blockchain. Others view such actions as a form of censorship. This had led to debate within the Ethereum community on how to square rules with principles.  “I think the ecosystem needs to pay more attention to censorship resistance and client diversity next year,” Jayanthi told CoinDesk. “Neither of those will be strictly addressed in the protocol roadmap for next year, so I’m hoping that the community layer takes charge until we can reasonably address it in the protocol.”  The censorship problem has also caused some fears of centralization, as most validators have chosen methods to add transactions to the blockchain that filter out Tornado Cash.  “We have worked hard to create an Ethereum protocol that is capable of being highly decentralized. But there are centralizing forces everywhere, and we need to be super attentive to them,” said Ben Edgington, the lead product owner at Teku, a client (which is a software) of Ethereum, developed by Ethereum blockchain-focused company ConsenSys. “We can’t force people to run Ethereum in a decentralized way, but it will become worthless if they don’t.”  More cool events, like Devcon and ETHGlobal meetups  Dinally, Ethereum will bring together developers, market shakers, policy makers and other community members at various global events, where people can collaborate on new ideas.  Devcon, the largest conference for Ethereum developers, is set to take place again in 2023 (though the location has yet to be determined). The conference, which took place in Colombia in 2022, is a highlight among Ethereum lovers, who often meet in different corners of the world to share their thoughts and innovations for the second-largest blockchain.  Other notable events for Ethereum include the popular EthCC in Paris, France, set to take place this year from July 17-20. Last year, layer 2 firms announced their ambitions for their various rollup solutions at that conference.  Ethereum.org also has shared meetup groups and global ETH hackathons for Ethereum enthusiasts around the world, making it easy for “Ethereans” to connect with other like-minded individuals.  Lastly, CoinDesk’s own Consensus will be taking place in Austin, Texas, from April 26-28, where there will be discussions about the Ethereum protocol, as well as other topics related to blockchain, crypto and Web3.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/04/ethereum-in-2023-heres-what-to-look-forward-to,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a48f4bbd73423d3be10e90448302ae8cd5d50c0-2500x1667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7029287,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514709,1672831848,This Needs To Happen For Bitcoin And Ethereum To See A Bullish 2023,"The year 2023 is starting off better for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market than last year ended. Even though most crypto prices are still trading in a very depressed, narrow range, BTC is at least showing a year-to-date performance of 1.55% and Ethereum of 4.5%. However, as QCP Capital writes in its latest market analysis, there are early signs that should caution crypto investors. While the gold price is currently performing extremely strongly, the trading firm raises the question of whether this will continue if the expected wave five of the USD rally takes place based on the Elliott wave theory. According to the theory, the fifth wave is the final leg in the direction of the prevailing trend. And a resurgent USD could mean further price losses not only for gold but also Bitcoin and crypto. As QCP Capital elicits, it remains to be seen if this will impact the other alternative asset classes as well.

Not to mention the liquidity within crypto itself which is an even smaller factor of that pic.twitter.com/grwcAdPLn6 — QCP Capital (@QCPCapital) January 4, 2023 Price Targets For Bitcoin And Ethereum Nonetheless, Bitcoin and Ethereum are in somewhat of a catch-up rally at the beginning of the year, much like gold. Despite the mini-rally, BTC is still trading in an extremely tight falling wedge, with 18k as the key breakout level on the upside, according to the firm. In the medium-term, $28,000 is looking more and more key – as the head and shoulders neckline, and 61.8% fibonacci retracement level of the $3,858 2020 low to $69,000 2021 high. According to QCP Capital, Ethereum “remains significantly more bullish than BTC,” though ETH is also trading in a consolidation pattern. Investors should keep an eye on the top of the triangle at $1,400 for now, before the key resistance zone between $1,700 and $2,000 could be targeted. On the downside, the company expects $1,000-$1,100 to be a very good support. The Macro Outlook For 2023 Probably decisive for whether 2023 will be a continuation of 2022 will be the macro environment. QCP Capital believes that inflation in the U.S. will fall significantly, but not enough to reach the Fed’s 2% target. This will cause the Fed to delay cutting rates as long as possible, as Jerome Powell does not want to be the guy in charge who makes the same mistake as in the 1970-80s when there was a “double-dip inflation era.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price Gains Momentum, Why ETH Could Rise To $1,300 This will lead to the Fed developing a “blinkered” mentality toward the far better numbers and making another mistake by easing monetary policy too late. “In a sad twist of fate, they will again wait too long and have to go into overdrive again,” the firm claims and concludes: We expect this could only come in Oct-Nov again this year, but remain open minded to markets bottoming sooner than that. At press time, the BTC price stood at $16,847, seeing a slight gain of 0,59% in the last 24 hours.

On the flip side, it has suffered sluggishness in terms of total value locked (TVL). Here’s a quick snapshot of Optimism: OP price spikes by 5.76% OP down in terms of TVL; now only $500 million Users save as much as 99.4% on ETH Arbitrum is seen to have blazed past the other leading Layer 2 blockchains including Optimism and Polygon when it comes to TVL. Regardless, the former remains unfazed as it still accelerates in tempo and dominates the L2 space. 🔥 THE TVL BETWEEN TOP LAYER 2 ON ETHEREUM 🔥 By overcoming #Polygon and #Optimism, @arbitrum has naturally risen to the top 1 Layer 2 in TVL through 2022. Do you think @arbitrum will become the new home of DeFi. (💙,🧡)? Let’s comment below 👇#Arbitrum #DeFi pic.twitter.com/AAtP0g8e2V — Arbitrum Space (💙,🧡) (@Arbitrum_Space) January 1, 2023 Optimism On A Bull Run According to CoinMarketCap, OP price is up by 5.76% or trading at $1.02 as of press time. On the contrary, its TVL isn’t too impressive as it dwindled down $550 million to now only $511 million as seen in the past 30 days, which also negatively impacted revenue. Chart: DeFi Llama The term “Layer 2” is used to describe an additional framework or protocol that is implemented on top of an existing blockchain system. These methods are designed to address the problems of transaction throughput and scalability being experienced by the most prominent bitcoin networks. Crypto total market cap at $778 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Optimism has been swinging and switching back and forth to higher lows and bullish highs. Evidently, OP price has spiked by as much as 15% overnight and is now green with the price range at $1.02. In the event that the bulls can hold on to its optimistic price momentum, Optimism could shoot to as much as $1.45 in the coming days. Can OP Barrel Past Key Resistance? There is an increased positive price action seen with Optimism as it is predicted to rally to as much as $1.53 in the next couple of weeks, and barreling past the key resistance. OP is going through an obvious uptrend and could retest the key resistance zone at $1.45. Meanwhile, Optimism has the ace in terms of gas efficiency compared to its rivals. One of the perceived reasons behind the incrementing growth usage on Ethereum is that users can save more ETH whenever they use Optimism. Chart: Dune Analytics Optimism was able to use less gas than other L2s, despite having a lower TVL and lower income, as reported by Dune Analytics. Even when compared to Arbitrum, the Layer 2 solution performed better. Customers’ aggregated savings from using Optimism for transactions also kept rising.

42414732,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBFTSZ,1672830513,"Shiba Inu-Themed BONK Tokens Are Yielding Nearly 1,000% for Solana Liquidity Providers","A flat market and contagion risks aren’t deterring crypto traders from finding the next major narrative to generate returns, and a meme coin is at the center of that in the Solana (SOL) ecosystem.  Bonk, a Shiba Inu-themed token that was issued on Dec. 25, has returned 2,220% to traders in the past week, with a 150% rise in the past 24 hours alone. The token was airdropped to Solana NFT (non-fungible token) communities and creators, which led to quick hype and trading volumes for the token, as CoinDesk reported Tuesday.  Early investors aren’t the only ones gaining, however. Liquidity pools on Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Orca have attracted over $20 million in volume for trading pairs involving BONK – cumulatively netting thousands of dollars in fees for liquidity providers.  Liquidity providers are investors who stake their cryptocurrency tokens on DEXs to earn transaction fees, usually in the form of token rewards.  Data from Orca shows the BONK/SOL pair has conducted over $14 million in trading volume, while the BONK/USD coin pair saw over $6.2 million. Both pools are paying out nearly 1% hourly to liquidity providers, or over 24% each day.  The metrics made bonk the most traded token on Orca, a popular Solana DEX, with trading volumes higher than even solana, usually the most popular trading pair with USDC.  As such, the yields are likely to be short-lived if the demand and hype for BONK slows down in the coming weeks and traders take profits.  Despite being fashioned as a meme coin, Bonk tokens are seeing steady adoption in the Solana ecosystem. Several Solana projects have already integrated Bonk tokens for use as payments for listed NFTs, and some introduced “burn” mechanisms for NFT-based events. Over 1 billion BONK was burned in the past 24 hours, according to tweets.  Meanwhile, the interest around bonk has likely contributed to the demand for SOL tokens.

The answer is yes, according to data that shows the S&P 500, Wall Street's equity index and a benchmark for risky assets worldwide, tends to bottom out and rally when the Consumer Price Index peaks. Bitcoin (BTC) has historically moved more or less in line with U.S. stocks.  The chart by Steno Research and Macrobond compares the U.S. CPI trajectory from 2018 to date with its 1972-1984 path and adds the S&P 500's performance during the 1970s.  The index bottomed out around the end of 1974. It subsequently peaked and rallied over 50% in the next 21 months. A similar pattern occurred after the CPI logged its second peak in March 1980.  The CPI's trend from 2018 to date looks analogous to the pop and drop of the early 1970s, meaning further deceleration in inflation and a revival in risky assets could be in the cards.  ""The 1972-1984 playbook shows how equities bounced right as the CPI peaked even as the earnings outlook deteriorated markedly at the same time,"" Andreas Steno Larsen, founder and CEO of Steno Research, said in a note published on Dec. 26, explaining reasons to begin 2023 with a bit of risk exposure.  ""If the market sniffs out an inflation-driven pause or a pivot from the Fed, even before a drawdown in risk assets is seen, we may get a disinflation rally that will wrong-foot all investment banks,"" he wrote.  Many investment banks and financial commentators on Twitter have penciled in a continued slide in risky assets in the first half of this year that will force the Fed to abandon its tightening policy.  The rate of U.S. consumer inflation cooled to 7.7% in November from a four-decade high of 9.1% in June. The Fed stepped down to a 50 basis-point rate increase in December after delivering four consecutive 75 basis-point hikes. The bank, however, signaled a higher rate peak in the range of 5% to 5.25%.  Limited upside  Still, some observers remain cautious.  ""An analog to the stagflationary 1970s shows that while the inflation downturn is imminent, it is likely it will not reach the Fed's 2% target. More worryingly, there is also a risk of a V-shaped rebound if the Fed loosens policy prematurely,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in its 2023 market unwrap note.  ""Fears of the same double-dip inflation as the 1970-80s is deeply edged in the FOMC's psyche,"" QCP said, referring the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.  In other words, the Fed, being aware of the premature liquidity easing of 1975 and the subsequent sharp rebound in inflation, is unlikely to give up tightening and pivot in favor of rate cuts anytime soon. That would keep potential gains in risky assets in check.  QCP expects large rallies to be met with strong selling pressure and prefers writing or selling bitcoin call options or bullish bets at a $20,000 strike price.

Image: The Daily Hodl Partnerships with HoldStation, a SocialFi wallet provider, and Odos Protocol, who launched a DEX aggregator on Avalanche, also played a big part on AVAX’s current trajectory. Can AVAX Break Through This Level? Surprisingly, AVAX is less correlated with Ethereum compared to Bitcoin. This can present a few challenges as the token is testing the $11.66 price resistance level. The king crypto received a beating last year with BTC continuing its sideways price movement after FTX collapsed. This price movement can be broken as January is chock full of macroeconomic indicators that would directly influence the broader financial market, especially AVAX.

This week will be crucial for AVAX as the Federal Open Market Meeting Minutes and the US Nonfarm Payrolls will be released. These would give insight into what the US Federal Reserve’s next step would be regarding the inflation situation. If the Fed ever decides to raise interest rates once again, AVAX might lose its current footing. As of writing, however, the token has already breached the $11.66 resistance level.

42414720,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBFSgo,1672821477,DeFi Tool Convex to Make Changes to Staking Service for Curve Token Rewards,"Convex Finance is making updates to its staking system on the Curve protocol that will allow users to earn more rewards and have more control over what rewards they receive.  Convex Finance is also proposing changes to the fees on the platform and redirecting some of the existing rewards to provide more incentives for staking.  These updates will be applied to the cvxCRV – which refers to the Convex and Curve token derivative staking system on Curve. The updates will allow users to add additional incentives to their cvxCRV staking, as well as adjust their rewards to include a mix of curve (CRV) and convex (CVX) tokens.  Convex allows users to access liquidity and earn fees from Ethereum-based stablecoin exchange Curve Finance, once the largest DeFi protocols with a total value locked (TVL) of $23 billion. As of Wednesday, Curve’s TVL had dropped to $3.2 billion, in line with a broader market fall. Convex locks over $3 billion and held over $21 billion during its 2021 lifetime peak.  Curve tokens (CRV) are issued as yield farming rewards to liquidity providers on Curve Finance, and can be converted into vote-escrowed CRV (veCRV). Holding veCRV allows users to participate in platform governance, earn higher rewards and fees and receive airdrops.  The tokens are time-locked, meaning users are incentivized to lock their CRV for a long time to receive more veCRV and platform rewards. However, this mechanism effectively locks up liquidity, creating opportunity costs for users.  To solve this problem, Convex pools all user assets together so that it can purchase curve tokens, convert them into veCRV and maximize rewards for its liquidity providers. This allows Convex users to receive Curve rewards without locking up curve tokens for lengthy periods.  Meanwhile, Convex also proposed fee structure changes that will see 2% of platform fees used to acquire and stake existing cvxCRV toward the new wrapper contract. This will increase the wrapper's overall rewards and remove cvxCRV from circulation – which could increase the value of tokens held by investors.",POSITIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/04/defi-tool-convex-to-make-changes-to-staking-service-for-curve-token-rewards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d340ee01d408100797ad39aba3e8e2e082a95f9a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414718,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBFSbV,1672819084,Indians Moved Over $3.8B to Foreign Exchanges Since Crypto Tax Rules,"Indians moved more than $3.8 billion in trading volume from local to international crypto exchanges after the country announced stiff crypto tax rules last February, according to a research study by Esya Centre, a New Delhi-based technology policy think tank.  A total of $3.85 billion was shifted from February through October, the study said.  The report provides the first monetary estimate of the impact of India's controversial crypto tax policy on domestic exchanges. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions on Feb. 1, 2022.  The 30% tax went into effect on April 1, and the 1% TDS on July 1. When the taxes were announced the industry was unable to back up its prediction that the levies would ""kill liquidity."" The Esya Centre report found that domestic exchanges lost 81% of their trading volumes in four months after the imposition of the much debated 1% TDS rule.  Days before the 30% tax came into effect, Nischal Shetty, CEO and founder of WazirX, one of India's biggest exchanges, said Indians would ""find ways to not be part of the [domestic] system because people are not going to leave crypto.""  Esya predicted that ""centralized exchange businesses would become unviable"" in India if the current trend continues.  ""We anticipate a commensurately large negative impact on tax revenues, as well as a decrease in transaction traceability – which defeats the two central goals of the extant policy architecture,"" the report said. ""The current tax architecture may lead to a loss of approximately $1.2 trillion of local exchange trade volume in the next four years.""  The report said that India's virtual digital-asset (VDA) industry is ""crippled under the current tax architecture"" and that the ""baseline scenario"" under the current structure is that ""almost all"" Indian centralized VDA users will move to a foreign exchange.  The researchers recommend TDS should be changed from 1% per transaction to 0.1%, which would be on par with the securities transaction tax. They also recommend allowing losses to offset gains and establishing progressive taxes on gains instead of the flat 30% tax.  As a current account deficit nation at an all-time high of $36.4 billion, India requires money to flow in as opposed to outflows to offshore exchanges that bypass banking channels. The latest findings might put pressure on authorities to clamp down on outflows through crypto that add to India's current account deficit.

42414722,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBFSm7,1672819040,Ethereum Name Service Recorded Over 2.8M Domain Registrations in 2022,"Ethereum Name Service (ENS) saw a lifetime record number of domain registrations in 2022 amid a broader market frenzy in which some traders treated the domains as investments.  ENS is a decentralized domain name protocol that runs atop the Ethereum network. It provides users with an easily readable name such as “abc.eth” instead of a complex, long-form alphanumeric address for their crypto wallets, similar to the way the Domain Name System substitutes memorable names such as ""coindesk.com"" for websites' numeric internet-protocol addresses.  Data from Dune Analytics shows that more than 630,000 unique wallets created 2.82 million domain names, with 459,000 of those classified as “primary names.” Primary names are ENS addresses that resolve to a user’s crypto wallet and can be used as a proxy to search for information on blockchain explorers, such as Etherscan. The 2.82 million figure represents over 80% of all registrations since the service started in 2017.  September saw the most ENS registrations at more than 430,000 unique domains, and December recorded the lowest at just 52,000 domains, the data shows. The month of May, however, saw the most new users at more than 64,000.  Some ENS buyers treat the names as investments, purchasing popular and common names and selling them for a profit, research firm Delphi Digital said in a July note.

42414724,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBFSwj,1672817521,This Promising Wireless Technology Could Help Power the Future Metaverse,"LAS VEGAS — To bring the metaverse to everyday life, it’s going to require something sleeker than today’s virtual-reality (VR) headsets. While the dream is for devices that resemble normal-looking glasses to power an always-on digital experience, the harsh reality is that power-hungry processors and chunky batteries require either extra bulk or compromised features.  Ixana, a relatively new company, believes it has found a way to build a new generation of personal devices that are much more power efficient than the headsets of today, and at CES 2023, it’s unveiling a developer platform so that others can start building applications for its technology. The core of Ixana’s innovation is a new way to transmit information: through the human body itself.  Well, not the body exactly, but the electromagnetic field surrounding it. Ixana’s technology, called Wi-R, makes use of the body’s natural ability as a conductor. A device either held or worn can transmit data over this field incredibly efficiently – Ixana claims it uses a hundredth of the amount of energy typically used in conventional wireless connections like WiFi or Bluetooth.  Why the technology ""metas""  The technology could be used in the metaverse, an immersive digital world created by the combination of virtual reality, augmented reality (AR) and the internet.  The idea is that you could have the smartphone in your pocket – which already has a hefty battery and performant processor – powering the headset on your face, transmitting all the data across the surface of your body, and you wouldn’t feel a thing. According to Ixana, Wi-R technology is capable of pushing four compressed high-definition video streams simultaneously.  “Everybody is trying to cram the computing in [VR glasses],” says Shreyas Sen, co-founder and chief technology officer of Ixana. “And it takes a huge amount of power, so it looks big. In the future, we imagine you will have technology all around you that gives you similar capability in a distributed network around your body. ”  CoinDesk tried the Wi-R technology at CES. We put on a pair of headphones that had a Wi-R chip, and when we moved our hand closer to a special cellphone, we could clearly hear music playing from the phone. The music stops when you move your hand away, which doesn’t seem impressive until you realize that neither the phone case nor the headphones are connected via any kind of wireless connection – the data was transmitted entirely through the electromagnetic field of the human body.  Ixana wants you to imagine that type of connection carrying video, VR, AR and more. Think of everything from your smartwatch to your sunglasses all continuously talking to each other without ever using a radio. This video shows the idea in some fanciful scenarios.  There are certain issues Wi-R technology can’t solve. The bulk associated with some wearable technology isn’t just because of batteries and processors: Screens and haptics demand lots of energy, and you can’t just put the battery somewhere else on your body. All the security and safety implications of transmitting data through a body need to be thought through, too. There’s a never-ending debate around whether cellphone radiation is harmful – if Wi-R ever catches on, it’s sure to spark its own set of skeptics.  Sen is realistic about the hurdles ahead, conservatively suggesting that it will be two to four years before the technology ever appears in a consumer device and about four to five years before smartphone manufacturers adopt it. Again, if it catches on at all.  But the release of the $999 developer kit brings it forward from just a proof of concept, and Sen says the company has backing from some major players, including Samsung. With wide adoption of Wi-R, the future of the metaverse might look a lot different from today, and the idea of building powerful augmented-reality eyeglasses – long a dream of the tech industry – might finally start to come into focus.",POSITIVE,없음,TECHNOLOGY | AR,Pete Pachal,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/04/this-promising-wireless-tech-could-help-power-the-future-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a24f1a3886a130da8db7a602999e521a21d44281-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With 2022 being very notorious with the amount of digital assets stolen, this security boost is highly appreciated by the community. However, on-chain security does not guarantee returns for Internet Computer investors and traders. Historically, ICP follows both Ethereum and Bitcoin in price movement. If ETH and BTC will suffer from internal or external factors in the crypto industry, it would reflect on the price of altcoins like Internet Computer. This year’s start for ETH and BTC has been shaky at best. With the BTC community celebrating Genesis Block day anxiously at $16,515 support, ICP has a long way to go in terms of bullish pricing. However, with analysts showing metrics that might be a precedent of a bull run, ICP might have a short-term upward momentum above $4.096 price resistance with support at $3.840.

On January 3, 2009, Bitcoin’s mystery creator Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first BTC block, marking the beginning of the digital currency’s 14-year lifespan. Bitcoin was created in the genesis block, but it’s unclear if they were ever transferred to a wallet. The celebration of Bitcoin’s start for this year is certainly bullish, with some analysts on Twitter anticipating almost absurd gains for BTC this 2023. Related Reading: Solana Up 13% Since Yesterday, A Sign Of Brighter Things to Come? But the bullishness of the top cryptocurrency has yet to be reflected on the charts. According to CoinGecko, BTC depreciated by 0.5% in the daily timeframe. What Does The Future Hold For Bitcoin? Since its inception 14 years ago, the top cryptocurrency has faced several bear market cycles. This has been the narrative since the end of 2022, that the cycle will continue and finally reach a new all-time-high. But party-pooping aside, this might not be the case. Several things are currently hindering Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. One is the loss of strong institutional investor trust on the cryptocurrency. Just last week, news of Bitcoin underperforming behind stocks and gold hit the markets. This certainly hit the idea of Bitcoin being a digital replacement of gold and made institutional investors wary of BTC and cryptocurrency as a whole. Macroeconomic headwinds have also been part of the equation. Related Reading: Ol’ Reliable Litecoin Up By 7% As LTC Flexes Muscles For 2023 Michael Burry, the guy who betted against the housing market in 2008, said that inflation will increase this 2023. This goes in line with the US Federal Reserve’s possible increases in interest rate. Adding on to the weight is the developing situation between the Winklevoss twins and DCG which sparked fear, uncertainty and doubt. With the wounds of 2022’s multiple high-profile crypto collapse of Terra Luna, Celsius, 3 Arrow Capital, and FTX still very much fresh, investors are wary that this might drag the crypto market to new lows.

Is $17K Reachable? Meanwhile, the January economic calendar of the U.S. is certainly filled with important events that will test and temper BTC and the broader financial market. The most notable of these is the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting Minutes which is expected to provide some insight into the Federal Reserve’s future decisions about increases in interest rate. As the FOMC meeting nears, the top crypto is seen staying on its current support at $16,515. But for BTC even reaching $17,000, it must break through the current resistance at $16,812 which might or might not happen once the FOMC meeting ends. -Featured image: Bitcoin Binge/Medium",NEUTRAL,BTC | LTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | LTC | MARKET,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-pushes-towards-17000/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42410872,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsCnQ,1672805783,Final Fantasy Parent Square Enix Is Bullish on Blockchain Gaming in 2023,"Blockchain-based gaming continues to garner interest among some of the largest global gaming companies, even in the face of an extended crypto winter that has chilled many sectors of the industry.  On Sunday, Square Enix, the multinational holding company behind the popular Final Fantasy video games, released a New Year's letter from its president and representative director, Yosuke Matsuda, affirming its push into blockchain gaming.  ""In terms of new business domains, we named three focus investment fields under our medium-term business plan,"" Matsuda wrote. ""Among those, we are most focused on blockchain entertainment, to which we have devoted aggressive investment and business development efforts.""  As part of its strategy for 2023, the Tokyo-based video game giant said it has ""multiple blockchain games based on original [intellectual property] under development,"" which it has been teasing since last year. It is also soliciting global investment to expand its stake in promising blockchain startups.  The company acknowledged that while it has been a year of ""great volatility"" for crypto, it remained confident in the future of Web3. ""In the wake of the aforementioned turbulence in the cryptocurrency industry, there is now a trend to view blockchain technology as a mere means to an end and to discuss what needs to happen to achieve the end of delivering new experiences and excitement to customers. I see this as a very beneficial development for the future growth of the industry.""  Conditions for growth in Japan  As Square Enix plans its further expansion into Web3, conditions for growth have been set in Japan, where the company is headquartered.  In June 2022, Japan's government approved a plan called “Priority Policy Program for Realizing a Digital Society,"" which outlined how the country would promote Web3 by learning more about decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). In July 2022, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry set up the Web3 Policy Promotion Office to field issues related to building a business on the blockchain.  Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been active in efforts to jump-start the country's economy, particularly through promoting investment in digital technology. In a policy speech in October 2022, Kishida said that Japan will continue to focus on “supporting the social implementation of digital technology” and will “promote efforts to expand the use of Web3 services that utilize the metaverse and NFTs.”  Japan's financial regulator has also proposed easing tax rules for corporate and individual crypto investors, and its digital ministry is exploring creating a DAO in order to better understand the technology.  Gamers remain skeptical  Square Enix has been ""aggressively investing"" in blockchain gaming since 2018, though its core audience of hardcore gamers remains skeptical of continued crypto integration.  In October 2021, the company launched Shi-San-Sei Million Arthur, a collection of NFT digital stickers on the LINE blockchain, as its first foray into digital collectibles. In a financial results briefing in November, the company said it would be making ""a robust entry into blockchain games"" and touted the addition of token economics into its games.  But traditional gamers have expressed skepticism about the dive into blockchain gaming, pushing back against the company's release of Final Fantasy VII collectible figures that came with NFTs as well as the recent announcement of its first game built around Ethereum NFTs called Symbiogenesis. Some gamers were also confused by the company's sale of three of its studios in May 2022, including the maker of the Tomb Raider franchise, in order to fund its blockchain expansion.  Still, investment in Web3 gaming continues to grow, and other traditional gaming studios like Ubisoft have also started to embrace the technology.  With its latest announcement, Square Enix has demonstrated that it intends to be a leader in the space.  ""Blockchain has been an object of exhilaration and a source of turmoil, but with that in the rearview mirror, we hope that blockchain games will transition to a new stage of growth in 2023,"" Matsuda wrote.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/04/final-fantasy-parent-square-enix-is-bullish-on-blockchain-gaming-in-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7dbd63d482478022438c807887141879c76a1b3-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413262,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Euo,1672796678,Israel’s Securities Watchdog Moves to Better Supervise Crypto Assets,"The Israel Securities Authority (ISA) is moving to establish a new legal structure for digital assets that puts them largely under the authority’s umbrella, which could provide the industry with greater clarity.  The amendments to the country’s laws would squeeze “digital assets” into existing securities regulations, according to the proposal, potentially treating most crypto as financial investments supervised by the ISA. The changes would define the assets as digital representations of value that are used for financial investment and that can be transferred using a distributed ledger. Digital assets would be added under the existing category of “financial instruments” in Israeli securities law.  This effort is meant to protect investors while also allowing for the unique advantages of cryptocurrency, the agency said. Though existing securities laws can already regulate some digital assets activity, according to the ISA, the regulations can be difficult to apply as currently written.  The authority’s proposal is open for public comment until Feb. 12, and the regulator suggests a six-month period before it would go into full effect after approval. The ISA has also sought to keep in mind that the regulations must be flexible to adapt to changes in the technology behind digital assets.  Anat Guetta, chairwoman of the ISA, has made it clear that she – taking cues from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler – didn’t see much distinction between cryptocurrencies and securities. “We have to wake up and understand that there is no real difference between crypto and securities and we have to unify the definitions in order to protect consumers and investors, and to make this industry legitimate,” she said in an interview with CoinDesk last year.  The industry has suffered mightily from high-profile failures, the agency noted in this week’s proposal, including the collapse of Celsius Network, which had significant operations in Israel.  This latest action from the country’s securities watchdog comes on the heels of the Ministry of Finance’s move to publish a set of recommendations in November for the regulation of digital assets, meant to advance Israel’s foray into the sector.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/04/israels-securities-watchdog-moves-to-better-supervise-crypto-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb2cbc4ce5de65b0643a7450258cd9500cee49da-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413256,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Eq8,1672796518,First Mover Asia: Why Is Tron Founder Justin Sun Keeping Some of His Coins in Valkyrie Digital Assets?,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin is flat on its 14th birthday. Ether and most other cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 by market capitalization were also trading sideways.  Insights: Why has Justin Sun sunk a large amount of his holdings in Valkyrie? CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds considers the Tron founder's decision.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMIP) 826.53 +2.9 ▲ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,712 +59.3 ▲ 0.4% Ethereum (ETH) $1,227 +15.2 ▲ 1.3% S&P 500 daily close  3,824.14 −15.4 ▼ 0.4% Gold  $1,846 +26.0 ▲ 1.4% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.79% ▼ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Trades Flat on Its 14th Birthday, Holds Over $16.6K  By James Rubin  Bitcoin's 14th birthday was a low key affair.  No cake, balloons or wild price increases on Tuesday to celebrate its launch into public awareness by the pseudonymous, mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization spent its special day embedded in the narrow $16,400 to $17,000 range it's held for 16 days. BTC was recently trading just above $16,700, almost precisely where it stood 24 hours earlier. What will shake it from its current levels remains uncertain amid the current torrent of bad crypto news, high inflation and worrisome macroeconomic issues.  ""I don't believe we've reached bottom,"" said Bilal Little, president of DFD Partners, a distribution platform for asset managers, on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""I still believe that there will probably be one or two more big headline issues that will drop in that will cause some impact on the marketplace. But once we hit somewhere in between, call it $12,000 to $13,000 or so, we should have a good flush of the system.""  Ether followed bitcoin's lead to trade just over $1,200, roughly flat from Monday, same time and firmly within the range it's held since mid-December. Most other major cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 by market value were mixed with some a few ticks of a percentage point in the green and others slightly red, although SOL, the token of the beleaguered Solana platform, recently jumped more than 22% to continue a nearly one-week surge that started when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted positively about the protocol. Yet, at just $13.6, SOL was still about 92% off its $176 perch from a year ago – the aftermath of its links to the collapsed Terra ecosystem and disgraced crypto exchange FTX.  Equity indexes closed their first trading day of 2023 down with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 falling 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively, as investors remained fretful about inflation and the looming prospect of recession. The economic aftershocks of China's decision to relax Covid restrictions also remained unsettling.  Meanwhile, the tortured tale of Sam Bankman-Fried continued as the disgraced former FTX CEO pleaded not guilty to eight federal counts, including wire fraud and campaign finance violations. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York ruled on a tentative October date for the anticipated weeks-long trial during Bankman-Fried's arraignment in a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday.  A report by brokerage firm Bernstein on Monday offered some hope for investors less concerned about the current crypto winter than digital assets' long-range upside. Bernstein said that despite bitcoin’s slump last year, it is up about 60 times from its 2014 low and roughly five times from its 2018 bottom. Ether is up 14 times from its 2018 lows, despite a 68% slide last year.  The crypto industry has a strong track record of fighting back from its lows and “taking punches when down,” the report said.  While the report added that the macro backdrop may be different this time, analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal noted optimistically that “crypto is probably among the few industries that can clock frontier-tech-like growth, in a broadly maturing tech landscape. And that it touches less than 5% of total internet users with “significant headroom for application led adoption.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Solana SOL +22.2% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +4.7% Smart Contract Platform Avalanche AVAX +3.7% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −0.5% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM −0.2% Smart Contract Platform Shiba Inu SHIB −0.2% Currency  Insights  Tron founder Justin Sun Has Significant Holdings in Valkyrie Digital Assets. Why?  By Sam Reynolds  Justin Sun talks a big game about Hong Kong and China, telling CoinDesk TV in October that he’s “optimistic” that one day crypto might return to China and later telling Bloomberg that its free-market oriented Special Administration Region of Hong Kong is in “embrace crypto mode.” Just as common law-based Hong Kong was the trial zone for free market capitalism for China, so will regulated crypto first kick off in Hong Kong before moving to the rest of China.  But where is Justin Sun’s money?  A significant amount is stashed away in the United States, as CoinDesk reported in December, in the treasury of Valkyrie Digital Assets, where Sun is one of its largest clients.  Specifically, it's in one of Valkyrie’s separately managed account (SMA) offerings, which are designed to give those more familiar with TradFi investment vehicles exposure to crypto.  There’s an angle to be examined if Sun’s outsized holdings domiciled in Valkyrie are a way to mask what the market perceives as institutional demand for crypto. But that’s neither here nor there at the moment.  For someone whose name is literally synonymous with the early days of crypto, it might be strange that they are parking so much capital in a vehicle that’s designed for boomer asset managers who are uncomfortable with self-custody to get exposure to digital assets.  Via Telegram, a spokesperson for Sun told CoinDesk that the Tron founder was looking to allocate ""some of his wealth in U.S. holdings,"" and to support ""regulated crypto industry growth.""  Link to China  But the decision could stem from conditions in China.  The country’s unpredictable legal system, which is happy to confiscate the wealth of dissidents – both real and perceived – has led to the country’s rich parking money overseas for decades.  As soon as the British announced that it would return Hong Kong to the People’s Republic of China in the 1980s, real estate in Vancouver became the hottest commodity for the territory’s wealthy. Taiwanese who felt that the island would be absorbed into China in the future followed suit. And as China emerged as a global power, minting hundreds of billionaires in the process, its elite bought into North American real estate creating multi-million-dollar hedges against China along the west coast in the form of luxury apartments.  While plenty of dirty money has flowed in too, the elite of legitimate means must feel vindicated as Beijing targets billionaires, and those who it feels have grown too powerful, like Jack Ma – who vanished after criticizing regulators and running afoul of Xi Jinping. Interest in Vancouver and other North American real estate has once again increased from Hong Kongers who fear that what little autonomy the territory has left will be removed in the coming years.  There’s nothing to say that Justin Sun has run afoul of the law in China. But he has also been quick to vote with his feet and ditch his PRC citizenship for various Caribbean passports as well as Malta. Now, he holds a Grenadian passport which he purchased along with a representative position to the WTO for the small island nation.  But Beijing’s mood can quickly change.  Authorities are cognizant of what an effective antidote crypto is to capital controls. The market for crypto in China is huge, although it doesn’t officially exist on the mainland, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Sun is a homegrown ‘success story’ for crypto, and his name is all over the market. Suddenly he could become persona-non-grata.  Reinstating citizenship?  While Sun isn’t a PRC citizen, that doesn’t really matter all that much to authorities in-country. Beijing has a history of forcibly reinstating citizenship for people it is targeting.  Gui Minhai, a Swedish-born Chinese citizen, ran a bookstore in Hong Kong that stocked plenty of titles critical of the Chinese Communist Party.  In 2015, he and his business associates, some based in Thailand and others in Hong Kong, went missing. It was later revealed that they were victims of an extraordinary rendition back to China and later charged with various crimes like “providing intelligence to overseas operatives.” During this process, Gui had his Chinese citizenship forcibly reinstated and Swedish citizenship canceled.  Should Sun ever find himself a target of Beijing’s scorn, which isn’t out of the realm of possibility considering how the CCP goes after vocal billionaires, up to the level of Jack Ma, his Grenadian passport isn’t going to do much to help him.  There’s no indication that will happen anytime soon, but smart businessmen like Sun are always hedging bets.  Self-custodying of wealth isn’t that safe when homes and offices can be raided, extraordinary rendition is on the table, and cryptographic keys can be compelled to be turned over to authorities. If it really wanted to, the government in Beijing could easily bully some Caribbean nations into giving up holding companies that store crypto (it’s got plenty of clout in that part of the world) for the types of people that would find their names in the Panama Papers.  But if that day comes, $500 million of Sun’s wealth will be safe and sound behind the U.S. legal system locked in Valkyrie’s treasury.  It’s a bit more complicated than just buying a few luxury apartments in California, but real estate is for boomers.

42413277,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8F4A,1672794606,Core Scientific to Shut Down Celsius Crypto Mining Equipment,"Bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) will shut down mining rigs tied to Celsius Mining, Core's largest client with over 37,000 machines, after a U.S. bankruptcy judge approved the motion to reject its contract.  Both companies are undergoing Chapter 11 bankruptcies: Celsius Mining filed on July 13, 2022, along with its parent company Celsius Network, while Core filed on December 21. The two companies have been in engaged in ongoing litigation over their contract. Core claims that Celsius is not paying its dues, whereas Celsius argues that Core unilaterally increased its power rate, which isn't stipulated in their services agreement.  According to the Jan. 4 court order, all of Celsius' mining rigs were to be powered down effective Jan. 3 and not to be restarted during the transition period. The mining machines are also ordered to be picked up within 75 days of shut down date, with Celsius to pay for the transportation costs.  In a Tuesday hearing, Core's bankruptcy Judge David R. Jones said that the motion to reject doesn't violate the automatic stay on Celsius's property (under U.S. bankruptcy law, once a petition for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy is filed, creditors are no longer able to collect debts from the bankrupt debtor, and Core is likely a Celsius creditor given their dispute over unpaid dues). Jones also called Celsius' objection a ""strategic"" maneuver in which Celsius is trying to ""take advantage"" of the judge in its own bankruptcy case, without that judge being able to voice his concerns.  On Dec. 28, 2022, Core Scientific asked the Southern District of Texas bankruptcy court to reject Celsius Mining's contracts as an emergency measure, with the hosting firm claiming it is losing about $2 million in incremental revenue a month. If Core Scientific were released from the obligation to host Celsius Mining's machines, the company said it could generate $2 million per month either by finding other clients or by using the space for its own machines, the firm said in the motion.  Core Scientific asked for a hearing on Jan. 3, citing the urgency of the matter, which it says is leading itto lose $28,840 per day in power costs.  Celsius, in its response, said it agrees with cancelling the contracts and taking its machines back, but disagreed with Core Scientific's hastiness to do so. ""This purported 'emergency' is entirely of Core’s own making and does not warrant a hearing on just two business days’ notice,"" Celsius Mining said in its Jan. 2 response to the motion. Celsius will have to consult with its own lenders before it can fully respond to Core's request, which it says it can't do in two business days. Celsius thus wanted to move the hearing to Jan. 23.  Celsius further argued that the motion to reject violates the automatic stay on Celsius' estate, and the mining rigs in question are under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court of the Southern District of New York (SDNY), where Celsius' case is currently being processed.  Celsius was open to having its rigs cut off from electricity on Jan. 3, meaning they wouldn't produce any bitcoin, its objection said.  In Tuesday's hearing, Celsius attorney Chris Koenig, of the Kirkland & Ellis law firm, said ""we've agreed that they can turn off our rigs effective today, and that they don't get to charge us, we don't continue to pay for it.""  All that's left is to hammer out a transition plan. Judge Jones gave attorneys representing each party some time to draft an agreed upon proposed order, which he said he would announce regardless of whether he signed it by mid-afternoon Tuesday. As of 7:30 p.m. ET (half-past midnight UTC), no proposed or signed orders were available in PACER, a federal court database system. Alfredo Perez, the attorney representing Core Scientific, hung up on a CoinDesk reporter, while Koenig did not immediately return a voicemail.  Celsius is not only Core's largest customer, with more than 37,000 machines hosted in its facilities, but one of its largest secured noteholders, holding about $54 million of secured convertible notes, or 10% of the total issuance, Kirkland & Ellis lawyer Chris Koenig, who represents Celsius, said in the first day hearing of Core's bankruptcy case.  Not only has Core tried to increase Celsius' hosting fee, contrary to their agreement, but they also blocked them from joining an Ad Hoc committee of secured convertible noteholders, who have been in discussions with Core to restructure debt, citing the ongoing litigation, Celsius said in its objection.  The ""most important"" part of the conversation around the contract is the transition period, Judge Jones said.  A copy of the agreement between the two firms filed in an affidavit on behalf of Celsius shows that the contract specified a tariff, but didn't explicitly say it is a variable rate. But in his deposition, also filed as part of Celsius' affidavit, Core Senior Vice President of Partnerships Jeff Pratt, said that it was implicit in the agreement.  Judge Jones said that the Celsius affidavit that this evidence is included in is ""totally inappropriate for so many different reasons"" and that it should ""simply be struck"" from the record.

6995936,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514597,1672790449,How Uniswap Was Saved From Critical Vulnerability By This Security Firm,"Security firm Dedaub discovered and disclosed a critical vulnerability on the popular Ethereum decentralized exchange Uniswap. The team behind the protocol fixed the bug, and the affected components were successfully redeployed—otherwise, an attacker could have tempered with transactions to steal a user’s funds. Related Reading: Ol’ Reliable Litecoin Up By 7% As LTC Flexes Muscles For 2023 Uniswap Avoids Danger And Fixes New Features According to the security firm, the vulnerability was unintentionally implemented with the Universal Router. This component allows Uniswap users to trade ERC-20 tokens and non-fungible tokens “into a single swap router.” In other words, Uniswap users can optimize their operations and trade multiple tokens and NFTs in a single transaction, saving time and money. This new component also allows users to transfer funds to third parties. When the vulnerability was in-placed, a user could send a transaction to a third party, and the latter could have gained access to the sender’s funds. Dedaub explained the following: (…) if third-party code is invoked at any point in the transfer (which manifests itself due to composition of protocols), the code can reenter the UniversalRouter and claim any tokens temporarily in the contract (…). The attacker also needs to implement code to reenter the router (calling execute) and sweep all token amounts. The router may contain funds mid-transaction due to other actions and transfers in a complex swap. The Universal Router hold the sender’s funds while the transaction is completed. While this happened, the funds were vulnerable, and a bad actor could drain them by calling specific commands such as “dispatch” with a “.TRANSFER” or. “.SWEEP.” The vulnerability could have allowed a bad actor to “re-entered” a transaction using this command. Once inside, the attacker could have been able to “drain the entire amount” from the sender’s wallet. The security firm added the following on the “endless scenarios” where the vulnerability could have been exploited: If untrusted code is invoked at any point in the transfer, the code can re-enter the UniversalRouter and claim any tokens already in the UniversalRouter contract. Such tokens can, for instance, exist because the user intends to later buy an NFT, or transfer tokens to a second recipient, or because the user swaps a larger amount than needed and intends to “sweep” the remainder to themselves at the end of the UniversalRouter call. And there is no shortage of scenarios in which an untrusted recipient may be called (…). Ethereum DEX Grants $3 Million In Bug Bounty In December 2022, Uniswap launched the Universal Router as part of their new NFT compatibility. At that time, Uniswap Labs announced a $3 million bounty program. Dedaub was granted this amount for their bug report on the new component. The firm celebrated the reward and the fact that a bad actor never exploited the vulnerability. In addition, the security firm was “the only bug report that Uniswap acted upon.” 2022 was a troublesome year for crypto and risk-on assets, while macroeconomic forces played against the nascent sector. Users experienced hurdles beyond declining prices as hackers and bad actors took billions from the industry. Data from on-chain analytics firm Chainalysis claims that bad actors have received over $26 billion in cryptocurrency from 2017 to 2021 alone. It remains to be seen if 2023 will extend or mitigate this trend.
