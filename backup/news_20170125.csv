42399564,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnbi,1485382105,"Despite Drop in Volume, Traders Stick With China's Bitcoin Exchanges","Despite the fact that major Chinese exchanges have seen their bitcoin volumes take a hit after introducing trading fees, these bourses still stand out as some of the top marketplaces when ranked by volume, according to market data.  OKCoin, BTCC and Huobi experienced significant declines in trading volume after they began charging fees, beginning on 24th January.  The decision to charge these fees built upon their earlier move to eliminate margin trading – two developments which thus far have had a clear impact on the market. The shift came amid scrutiny from Chinese regulators, including the country's central bank.  Not only has trading volume fallen, but volatility has been subdued, with bitcoin prices trading in a tight range between $885 and $905 on 25th January, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures show.  Top exchanges  Following the market’s recent shifts, OKCoin and BTCC emerged as top exchanges for trading activity on 25th January, reporting 15.1k BTC and 12.56 BTC worth of volume during the 24 hours through roughly 21:00 UTC on that session, according to data from Bitcoinity.  Market data for Huobi, another major Chinese exchange, was not available on Bitcoinity at press time.  These 24-hour trading volume figures present a strong contrast to market data from the last seven days, during which market participants traded 2.13M BTC through OKCoin and 1.48M BTC through BTCC.  When the figures are averaged out, OKCoin saw daily trading volume of roughly 300k BTC, while BTCC experienced approximately 210k BTC worth of trades.  With such drastically lower trading volume and reduced volatility, one can not help but wonder whether the bitcoin markets have entered a new normal.  A perfect example of how much the landscape has changed is the more even distribution of trading volume across exchanges worldwide, as shown by the Bitcoinity data below:  Some traders have already responded to the new situation by changing up their strategies, according Vinny Lingham, CEO of identity startup Civic.  He told CoinDesk:  “Trading is now moving away from arbitraging liquidity/price mismatching across exchanges to arbitraging demand/supply.”  Other market participants, by contrast, appear to be still figuring out exactly how to should respond to the latest new from China’s major exchanges, according to Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.  He told CoinDesk that the market is split into two camps, with one seeing the developments as positive, believing that “regulation legitimizes bitcoin”.  The other side maintains the Chinese government intervention could be negative for bitcoin, and the fees could “dampen trading volume and interest in China"", he said.

42399557,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnWn,1485374771,Bank of England Chief: DLT Could 'Reshape' Banking,"Distributed ledger tech could ""reshape"" banking, Bank of England chief Mark Carney said today.  The G-20 international organization is hosting a conference on finance and digitalization this week, with blockchain and distributed ledgers forming one of the event’s central themes. The event is being hosted in Germany, in the city of Wiesbaden.  Carney, who also acts as chair of the Financial Stability Board – the group of central banks and finance ministers that is conducting its own blockchain research – touched on both the UK central bank’s work with the tech as well as some of the broader implications for the banking sector.  The Bank of England  has played a leading role amongst institutions of its kind in testing concepts for a central bank-issued digital currency. Other central banks, including those from Canada, Japan, Russia and the European Union, among others, have explored similar initiatives.  According to Carney, such a launch would carry benefits – and costs.  He told conference attendees:  ""On some levels this is appealing; people would have direct access to the ultimate risk-free asset. In the extreme, however, it could fundamentally reshape banking including by sharply increasing liquidity risk for traditional banks.""  One use case Carney highlighted in his speech – settlement – has been the subject of attention at the Bank of England. Just under a year ago, Minouche Shafik, the central bank's deputy governor for markets and banking, suggested that the tech was on the table as the Bank of England considers upgrades to its settlement systems.  According to Carney, central banks could see some advantages in relying on the tech for this purpose.  ""Emerging technologies, such as distributed ledger, could in future offer significant gains in the accuracy, efficiency and security of processes across payments, clearing and settlement as well as better regulatory compliance,"" he told attendees. ""In the process, tens of billions of dollars of capital may be saved and resilience could be significantly improved.""

42399556,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnUp,1485366485,Commonwealth Bank Develops Blockchain for Government Bonds,"A major bank in Australia is developing a blockchain-based system for the sale of government bonds.  The Australian Financial Review reported that Commonwealth Bank of Australia has designed a blockchain network concept that could be utilized to issue and exchange government bonds. The Queensland Treasury Corporation, which acts as the Australian state’s central financing authority and provider of treasury services, is said to have tested the concept.  Other states in Australia, according to the newspaper, have also eyed the technology.  Deputy CEO for the Queensland Treasury Corporation Grant Bush told the publication:  “[We are] looking at the long-term implications of the technology as a semi-government issuer and broader market participant.”  A number of companies and organizations have looked at the tech as a mechanism for issuing digitized bonds, leveraging blockchain as a means of transfer.  French bank BNP, for example, announced last September that it was exploring the tech for use in distributing mini-bonds. That same month, eight members of the R3 bank consortium announced that that they had tested a system for trading US Treasury bonds, leveraging a platform developed by Intel dubbed Sawtooth Lake.  According to AFR, next steps include seeking regulatory approval for the project, which Commonwealth Bank intends to pursue in the months ahead.

42399562,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnaj,1485363486,Bitcoin Prices Dip Below $900 After Trading Volume Drop,"Bitcoin prices fell below $900 during late-night trading, continuing that trend as the day progresses.  The digital currency’s price tumbled yesterday after major exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin began imposing trading fees following guidance from China's central bank. That move triggered a broad decline in volume at these exchanges.  This development, combined with the previous announcement that those exchanges would halt margin trading, seems to have placed some downward pressure on prices. Bitcoin fell to as little as $885.72 on 24th January, roughly 2.5% below their daily high of $908.39, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  At the start of 25th January, prices averaged $885.65, additional BPI figures reveal. Bitcoin prices rose to as much as $902.73 at 02:45 UTC, before quickly dropping below $900 once again.  At press time, the price of bitcoin is at an average of $895.46, an increase of just over 1% from the day's open.  CNY-denominated markets are up more than 5% today. After opening the day at ¥5,868.13, CNY-denominated markets climbed to as high as ¥6,307.26. Prices are currently averaging ¥6,237.62, BPI data shows.  Bitcoin prices have experienced a period of relative stability, according to the BPI, fluctuating between roughly $880 and $940 since 19th January. This market state sharply contrasts with earlier this month, when bitcoin prices experienced sharp gyrations, rising to a three-year high and falling close to $200 within a single hour.

42399549,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnOv,1485359113,EU Securities Watchdog: Too Early to Predict DLT Impact,"It’s too early to predict the full regulatory impact of distributed ledger technology (DLT), a representative of Europe's securities watchdog argued this week.  Patrick Armstrong, a senior risk analysis officer for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), made the comments during a speech at a securities industry event in Oslo on 23rd January.  In his remarks, Armstrong touched upon a number of the factors changing securities trading in Europe, including distributed ledgers.  Notably, he indicated it is not yet possible to say which regulations might need to change due to the growing adoption of the tech, saying:  ""We believe it is premature to appreciate all the technological changes and the potential regulatory response that may be needed, as the technology is still in its infancy.""  The agency has spent much of the past year and a half investigating DLT for its potential impact on the EU's securities market.  It released a new discussion paper in June, and its officials have spoken on the subject in the past, suggesting that, pending further adoption, the industry's landscape could be altered significantly. ESMA first began soliciting feedback from stakeholders in mid-2015.  In his speech, Armstrong further suggested that regulations outside the finance space may also be impacted by DLT, thereby affecting adoption of the tech as it may occur in the months and years ahead.  ""[A] number of concepts or principles, eg, the legal certainty attached to DLT records or settlement finality, may require clarification as DLT develops,"" Armstrong noted. ""Also, ESMA realizes that beyond pure financial regulation broader legal issues, such as contract law, insolvency law or competition law, may impact on the deployment of DLT.""

42399560,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnYl,1485356414,"Microsoft Unveils Project Manifest, A Plan For Blockchain Product Tracking","Technology originally developed to help NASA communicate with deep space probes now lies at the heart of a new Microsoft blockchain project that would track products as they move around the world.  But more than that, Microsoft's Project Manifest, unveiled today, could eventually help ensure the origin of the products used to create goods and the labor used to build them conform to a company’s ethical standards.  Built via an initial partnership with Los Angeles-based Mojix, Project Manifest leverages the startup's widely used Internet of Things (IoT) platform, which is currently being integrated with the ethereum blockchain to help factories, distribution centers and retailers track goods using radio frequency identification (RFID) devices.  The RFID implementation has the potential to inform every member of the supply chain the moment a shipped product goes missing, according to the firms involved.  In interview, Microsoft’s global business strategist, Yorke Rhodes, explained why the new partnership was chosen to become the cornerstone of future supply chain implementations.  Rhodes told CoinDesk:  ""Project Manifest is actually designed to look at the challenges of visibility in the supply chain. One of the reasons why we worked with Mojix is because they already have technology and know-how in supply chains for scanning RFIDs.""  Mojix has raised $40m in venture funding from Red Rock Ventures and others, and is already helping a number of major clients track goods, including Perry Ellis, Prada, Scania Trucks, Cessna and British Petroleum.  A new database  Currently, Mojix’s big data framework behind the IoT platform is powered by a noSQL database, but Project Manifest puts a new twist on this design.  An early version of the blockchain solution now integrates Mojix’s platform, called ViZix, with a smart contracts application layer, and was exhibited during an event last week at the National Retail Federation’s convention in New York City.  Mojix's ViZix blockchain integration is being designed to take advantage of the rapidly growing rate that manufactured goods are being labelled with RFID, Bluetooth and GPS sensors.  Last year, retailers in the US increased RFID adoption by 32%, according to a reporthttp://info.rfid.auburn.edu/2016-state-of-rfid-adoption-among-u.s.-apparel-retailers by Auburn University's RFID Lab. In total, 4.6 billion RFID labels were expected to hit the market last year, with room to grow by as much as 85%, according to an IDTechEx Research report.  The more of these devices that exist, the stronger the system of smart contracts can become.  Project Manifest will likely evolve along similar lines to Microsoft's Azure blockchain-as-a-service platform, with additional members joining in the future – partners who will increase the potential commands that can be written into the contacts.  Money savings  Initially, the visibility provided by giving participants in a supply chain access to the same, private record is expected to cut costs on auditing, insurance, supply chain financing, risk mitigation and reduced charge-backs that result when a good is lost or mishandled.  The money that could potentially be saved from the permissioned blockchain application alone is enough to drive the development, Mojix’s vice president of retail business development, Tom Racette told CoinDesk.  Last year, the National Retail Federation reported an estimated loss of $46.2bn-worth of retailer inventory as a result of shoplifting, robbery and loss. According to a Loss Prevention Media report the average cost of cargo theft during transportation was $300,000 per incident.  Racette explained the impact blockchain could have on these losses:  ""Essentially, what we are trying to do is we’re trying to prevent claims so that when a shipment gets to a retailer it’s accurate, and if there’s any problems throughout the process it gets corrected and validated before it even ends up at the retail door.""  Exact details of the average losses incurred throughout the supply chain are hard to come by, according to Mojix, because suppliers don’t want to give the impression they’re unable to handle client products.  But should Project Manifest ever connect real-world supply chains via a blockchain some of the resulting data might eventually be made public, according to Microsoft's Yorke.  While customer data pertaining to identity and cost will likely always remain cryptographically secured behind the permissioned implementation of the ethereum blockchain, other data that could actually result in increased sales and might one day move to the public implementation, he said.  ""The consumer would like to be able to see where the goods are to make sure they’re not coming from slave labor and things like that,"" said Yorke. ""By way of giving consumers the ability to do that we’d like to push certain parts of the data to a public blockchain.""  Exploring standards  In addition to the Mojix partnership, this early incarnation of Project Manifest includes work with a standards body and support from the academic sector.  Today, Racette is in New York City to attend a meeting with global business language standards body GS1 to explore its EPCIS data standard for trading partners.  Just last week, Project Manifest confirmed that two professors and 10 students from Auburn University’s RFID lab would also participate. Already, the lab has been engaged with seven brands and three retailers to try to create ways to deal with a recent increase in supply chain data.  As part of Project Manifest, the team is currently studying electronic proof of delivery, vendor scorecarding, anti-counterfeiting, anti-grey market, and data exchange data, with a report expected by the end of the year.  Lab director Justin Patton told CoinDesk that the combination of more RFID technology and more sophisticated types of measurement are making it increasingly difficult to accurately track and exchange data.  Patton concluded:  ""We are looking at blockchain to help fill this need with a flexible and secure solution. We believe that we can adapt GS1’s EPCIS data standards to work with blockchain as a medium and we’re off to the races.""

42399550,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnPu,1485352814,Scaling Revisited: What If Bitcoin's Big 'Problem' is Its Great Strength?,"""Maybe it's not as big a problem as we think it is.""  That sentiment, summed up by bitcoin lending startup founder Shawn Owen, was one of the more notable threads to emerge yesterday at the third annual Satoshi Roundtable, one that followed nearly six hours of debate on challenges facing the technology.  A gathering for well-connected early adopters, top technical minds and institutional evangelists in sunny Cancun, Mexico, the event played host to discussions on a diverse set of issues (token sales, regulation, policy, etc). However, scaling, or the means by which the open-source technology's rules could be altered to accommodate more users, was high on the agenda.  Though short on conclusions (perhaps owing to issues with this approach in last year), the discussion was notable for its range of approaches to the topic.  Far from just a technical problem, though, there seems to be a sense among bitcoin's avid supporters that the current challenges are more philosophical and social, made worse by entrenched interests who have an economic incentive for their opinions.  Chief among the topics up for discussion was the state of industry dialogue itself, with advocates from bitcoin's main technological camps – those in favor of solutions such as Segregated Witness as well as so-called 'on-chain' scaling initiatives – agreeing perhaps only that the issue is now almost completely mired in disagreement.  Yet, opinions on the state of industry discussion are evolving in unexpected ways.  For example, one acknowledged area of disconnect is increasingly the question of whether or not bitcoin even has a problem. Even without scaling, the reasoning goes, the price is high and interest in the platform and its security remains strong.  As put forward by BitGo software engineer Jameson Lopp, perhaps bitcoin's biggest issue isn't really one at all.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Some people see problems around transaction fees and usage, others see problems around scalability and other people see no problems at all. Some see a robust and secure system that is in fact so secure, it can't even be changed, even if that is potentially for the better.""  At stake here is which version is likely to contribute to a stronger platform, and which one adheres more to its original espoused values – some of which many network participants have devoted years of their life to achieve.  ""You have 'decentralized and secure', and then you have 'buy a coffee',"" one participant said.  'Mired in politics'?  Equally notable were the attempts by discussion participants to understand the motivations on either side of the aisle.  Much thought, for instance, was put into SegWit (a proposal authored by bitcoin's main technological working group) and why it has yet to be adopted by the network's miners.  In attendance was one representative of China's mining community who framed the problem as one that was nearly all political, suggesting that miners were blocking the proposal purely out of a distrust of its technical working group, Bitcoin Core.  Of note is that major miners, he said, have enough stake in the network to block advancements of the proposal – in almost any form.  One idea – that SegWit first be tested on the alternative blockchain platform litecoin as means to showcase its benefits – was met with similar obstacles. While some argued litecoin has perhaps a better chance of adopting the measure, many of its miners are also bitcoin miners who could just as easily impede progress there.  Also discussed was whether China's miners even perceived there to be any problems with the network itself, and if their continued receipt of rewards would incentivize this group not to pursue any action out of a lack of obvious need.  'Misguided dialogue'  Yet, there was a minority view that bitcoin's inability to achieve any technical consensus on a change was perhaps a 'feature not a bug', to use an industry analogy.  John Carvalho, a marketing manager at bitcoin livestreaming platform Xotika.tv, for example, argued that the dialogue itself is perhaps misguided, and that bitcoin is simply proving itself at defending complex social and political attacks.  ""Everybody here is projecting their own commercial interests onto bitcoin saying that it's stagnating or failing,"" he said, adding:  ""All along, bitcoin is just sitting there, the fees are very affordable and they will continue to be affordable.""  Lopp argued that BitGo, for example, is onboarding more users, and that it is ultimately this growth that should define the conversation.  However, Justin Newton, CEO of digital identity startup Netki, offered a different take.  A veteran of the dot-com days, he argued that the view that bitcoin's inability to achieve any bottom-up decision-making isn't one that should be necessarily lauded.  ""Saying you don't have a governance model, doesn't mean you don't,"" he said. ""It may not be a transparent process that is auditable and repeatable, but the process exists.""  Compromise and no compromise  Elsewhere, there were signs that there was an increasing appetite for a discussion that would break the months of indecision on how bitcoin could be improved.  There appeared some interest in bridging the gap between the two camps with a compromise that would find bitcoin's developers committing to increase the network's block size, a long-contentious technical attribute that mitigates transaction volume, to 2MB, a change that would accompany the approval of SegWit.  Still, there was not broad agreement that consensus could be achieved.  Amidst a backdrop of egos battling egos, others cautioned that even the idea that the 'scaling debate' was a finite issue to be solved is impeding progress.  As reasoned by Kraken employee Yifu Guo, all scaling solutions are temporary fixes for battles that will continue on until the technology goes mainstream.  He concluded:  ""Maybe scaling is a good problem to have.""

42399554,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnSr,1485349860,China's Central Bank to Continue Bitcoin Exchange Inspections,"China's central bank plans to continue scrutinizing domestic bitcoin exchanges.  The People's Bank of China (PBoC) released its latest statement detailing how it would oversee the industry today, a move that comes weeks after it first began publicizing meetings with representatives from BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin.  The PBoC went on to say that it would oversee the space more closely, later finding fault with the exchange’s policies on margin trading (though no penalties have been levied).  According to the PBoC, that scrutiny will continue via additional on-site inspections.  The central bank said in a translated statement:  ""According to the initial inspection and the problems found, the inspection group decided to continue to focus on payment and settlement, anti-money laundering, foreign exchange management, information and financial security and other aspects of further examination.""  The statement also included a warning to investors, who the central bank said ""should pay attention to bitcoin platform transactions, such as legal compliance, market volatility, financial security and other risks"".  The PBoC’s statement comes amid a sea change within the country’s exchange ecosystem.  Following guidance from the central bank, the three major exchanges ultimately halted their leveraged trading services, and this week launched new fees on trading.  Yet while prices have seen a drop in volatility, volume at those exchanges has fallen sharply in the wake of the adjustments.

42399565,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjndg,1485342017,Real Volumes Revealed? How China's Bitcoin Market is Adapting to Fees,"Bitcoin volumes fell sharply yesterday, a move that illustrated the market’s strong response to a previously announced decision by China-based exchanges to end 'no fee' trading policies and halt margin lending.  Though analysts had long speculated as to what the result of the change would be (given assertions that the markets were being bolstered by high-frequency traders), the results have so far been more extreme than projected.  Overall, the lower volume at these three major exchanges has had a depressing effect, reducing transaction activity across the board.  In response, analysts quickly highlighted the potential benefits of the situation.  Entrepreneur and investor Vinny Lingham described the declines as ""healthy and positive moves"", predicting the market will enjoy new and genuine price discovery.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, also provided an upbeat assessment, telling CoinDesk:  “The enormous amount of fake volume was misleading traders. Now that a fee applies for each trade, auto-trading bots can no longer function profitably, price manipulation is less pervasive, and volumes have plummeted. Volatility is expected to drop as well.”  While the input of these market analysts can certainly prove insightful, it is helpful to take a look at some hard numbers.  Sharp declines  BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi all saw their trading volume drop early on 24th January.  For example, market participants traded less than 8,000 BTC through BTCC in the session's first hour, nearly 80% less than the 37,000 BTC the exchange recorded during the final hour of the 23rd January session, Bitcoinity data reveals.  This trend of sharp reduction continued, and trading volume reached a daily low of 138 BTC during the hour through 06:00 UTC before experiencing sharp gyrations.  This transaction activity rose to roughly 1,100 BTC and 2,300 BTC in the next two hours, before falling back to levels that were almost as depressed as the daily low.  OKCoin's trading volume followed a similar trajectory, plunging more than 50% from roughly 26,000 BTC during the final hour of 23rd January to approximately 13,000 BTC in the first hour of 24th January, Bitcoinity data shows.  This downward trend continued until trading volume fell to less than 500 BTC during the hour through 08:00 UTC.  Hourly transaction activity managed to stage a recovery after this, rising to almost 3,000 BTC at one point. But it declined significantly after, reaching roughly 126 BTC.  Notably, the last three hours through 20:00 UTC all experienced volume of less than 200 BTC.  Huobi’s trading volume suffered an even sharper drop than that of BTCC and OKCoin in the first hour of today’s session, declining more than 80% to roughly 382 BTC from 2,387 BTC in the prior session’s final hour, according to Cryptowatch.  The exchange’s transaction volume did push higher later in the day, rising to an hourly volume of close to 1,500 BTC. However, it never came close to the hourly volume of 11,900 BTC attained on 23rd January.  New trading environment  Now that the major Chinese exchanges have imposed fees, several market observers have forecast that the development will have a significant impact on the market.  While some of these analysts – for example Lingham and Zivkovski – made optimistic predictions about this situation, not everyone provided a rosy assessment.  While the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) decision to crack down on local trading could simply help “rein in” the minor transactions of hobbyist algorithmic traders, it could potentially provoke concerns in the markets, according to cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff.  ""The larger fear is that the PBoC's tougher stance will scare off the Chinese buyers who've driven BTC to these heights,"" he said.  Eliosoff ended on a bearish projection, suggesting a prolonged volume slump could have a much more significant impact on the price, adding:  ""And the even larger fear is that bitcoin's price is still too unhealthily dependent on China.""

According to the Washington Post, Mulvaney ran into a hiccup or two during his hearings.  The conservative US Representative drew fire from Democrats because of a failure to pay $15,000 in federal taxes related to a household employee. Describing it as “a mistake in my family”, Mulvaney said the amount has since been paid.  Elsewhere, he defended his past positions on federal spending and entitlement programs, telling committee members that he would take a “fact-based approach” to his role as US budget chief.  Mulvaney was one of two members of Congress to back the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, an effort aimed at boosting awareness for the tech among US legislators. Mulvaney has also been a prominent congressional face at industry events, including those held in Washington, DC.
