LitePay ‚Äì which also claimed it would offer a crypto wallet and ""LitePay debit card"" through which users could convert litecoin into U.S. dollars ‚Äì was unveiled in December of 2017 and set to launch in February of this year.¬†Data from OpenGovUS shows that LitePay¬†Inc. started operating on February 1.  The proposed business venture had won plaudits from the Foundation previously, which took to Twitter in December to write: ""Finally, someone is taking the opportunity to create litepay.us. Good job!""  However, as of February 26,¬†LitePay had only started to roll out its merchant service, according to a post on Twitter. The last public messages from the company related to a mid-March Ask Me Anything session on Reddit, and an email account listed on LitePay's website did not reply to a request for comment by press time.  The foundation, which oversees development of the cryptocurrency,¬†said in its post that it contacted the business' founder and CEO, Kenneth Asare, following the AMA on March 16, expressing¬†concerns regarding the ""less than transparent nature"" of LitePay. It was then that Asare revealed that he had decided to halt operations and planned to sell the company.  The Foundation's post further explained:  ""It was at this time that Kenneth asked the foundation for more funds to continue operations. The foundation refused any further funding as he was unable to provide a satisfactory picture of where the money had been spent and refused to go into exact details about the company and show objective evidence to back up his statements.""  Both the Foundation and litecoin founder Charlie Lee expressed regret for their support of the project.  ""Like everyone else, we got too excited about something that was too good to be true and we optimistically overlooked many of the warning signs,"" Lee wrote on Twitter. ""I am sorry for having hyped up this company and vow to do better due diligence in the future.""  The Litecoin Foundation made a similar statement in its post:  ""We are greatly disheartened that this saga has ended in this way and we apologize for not doing enough due diligence that could have uncovered some of these issues earlier. We are currently working hard to tighten our due diligence practices and ensure that this does not happen again.""  Nonetheless, the Foundation struck a hopeful tone.  ""Litecoin was doing perfectly fine before the promise of LitePay and will continue to do so,"" it said.

In a March 26 statement, the group behind the Bitcoiin¬†cryptocurrency said that both Seagal and the ""founders"" of the project are exiting in light of the token sale's completion.  The post stated:  ""As Bitcoiin goes through the conversion phase from token to mineable coin we wish to advise that Bitcoiin will join the likes of the original Bitcoin and become a truly open source. Therefore a big thank you to the Founders and to our Brand Ambassador whom we wish all the best in their future endeavors. However, from this point on Bitcoiin will function within its ecosystem and become a genuinely anonymous cryptocurrency with no individual or individuals having control over the entity!""  As previously reported, outside of Seagal, it hasn't been clear who is exactly behind the project, though BehindMLM,¬†a blog that covers multi-level marketing schemes, has profiled some of the efforts to promote the token sale following a cease-and-desist order from regulators in New Jersey. A now-deleted webinar, originally posted to YouTube, had previously claimed that the team behind Bitcoiin wished to remain anonymous.  The exits also come days after regulators in the state of Tennessee issued a warning to investors about Bitcoiin, citing the action in New Jersey.  Seagal has made no public comment regarding his exit via Twitter, where he has posted a number of promotional messages during the Bitcoiin token sale. The last one teased news about a forthcoming exchange listing, though it's not clear which market¬†he was referring to.  No staking here, says Bitcoiin  The statement issued Monday highlighted the push toward open-source development, though efforts to do this publicly seem to have only begun earlier this year.¬†A GitHub page associated with Bitcoiin¬†features a fork of the Go-Ethereum (geth) client, listing changes that appear to be largely cosmetic.  For example, a commit from nine days ago features changes like adjusting the email address for ethereum founder Jeffrey Wilcke from ""jeffrey@ethereum.org"" to ""jeffrey@bitcoiin2g.org.""  The press release also emphasized that, following the token sale, ""neither STAKING nor REFERRALS will exist in the blockchain or the Bitcoiin ecosystem."" The group blames ""the media which believe in sensationalism instead of reality"" for spreading this idea, though Bitcoiin's own statement from February 5¬†outlined how ""Bitcoiin Staking"" would let ""anyone holding Bitcoiin in their wallet...receive interest on their balance in return for helping maintain the security of the network.""  ""The 1% reward is generated through our mining eco-system and hence we are able to provide the guaranteed monthly return,"" the statement explained at the time.

The California-based company's GPUs are highly sought after by both gamers and crypto miners due to their parallel processing power ‚Äì and the surge in crypto mining has made it difficult for gamers to get their hands on the products, said Jen-Hsun Huang, who is also the company's co-founder, during an interview with TechCrunch.  He noted that:  ""We're sold out of many of our high-end SKUs, and so it's a real challenge keeping [graphic cards] in the marketplace for games ... we have to build a whole lot more ... We've got to come closer to the demand of the market. And right now we're not anywhere near close to that and so we're just going to have to keep running.""  The demand comes ‚Äì at least partly ‚Äì from the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, Huang explained.  He told TechCrunch that ""at the highest level the way to think about that is because of the philosophy of cryptocurrency - which is really about taking advantage of distributed high-performance computing ‚Äì there are supercomputers in the hands of almost everybody in the world so that no singular force or entity that can control the currency.""  Despite the GPU shortage, crypto miners still comprise only a small portion of Nvidia's total business, Huang said in the interview.  Last month, Huang noted that ""crypto ... is not going to go away"" during an interview with Barron's. At the time, Nvidia announced that its revenue from cryptocurrency miners had beaten expectations, though chief financial officer Colette Kress minimized the impact miners actually had during an earnings call.

Chris Concannon, the firm's president, didn't directly push the agency to approve such a product. Rather, he cited data collected by the company through its launch of bitcoin futures late last year to make the argument that the market is moving toward being able to support an ETF.  His letter  was a response to a January release from the SEC, in which it outlined its concerns over approving an ETF, citing market fragmentation and investor protection shortfalls in particular.  In his response, Concannon noted that although they are young, the bitcoin commodity markets ""are developing quickly,"" which is promising for future exchange-traded products (ETPs).  Concannon added:  ""Looking specifically to bitcoin, the nascent futures markets are developing quickly and, while the current bitcoin futures trading volumes on Cboe Futures Exchange and CME may not currently be sufficient to support ETPs seeking 100% long or short exposure to bitcoin, Cboe expects these volumes to continue to grow and in the near future reach levels comparable to those of other commodity futures products at the time that they were included in ETPs.""  ""While Cboe shares many of the concerns raised in the Staff Letter, we believe that the vast majority of these concerns can be addressed within the existing framework for commodity-related funds related to valuation, liquidity, custody, arbitrage, and manipulation,"" the letter noted.  Speaking with Business Insider, Concannon remarked that he sees the markets for government-issued currencies and gold as being ""probably more fragmented"" than cryptocurrency markets, noting that ""there are a lot of venues to access currency markets.""

Mining is an energy-intensive process through which new transactions are added to the blockchain, simultaneously rewarding miners with new coins for their efforts.  The mining allegedly took place from September 2016 through January¬†2017, and resulted in 15,000 rubles in profit - about $260 - according to the Russian Legal Information Agency (RAPSI).  The Agency also indicated that the employees' mining activities consumed more than 57,000 rubles' ($1,000) worth of electricity. The workers were subsequently charged with abuse of power, and they have reportedly paid their fines in full.  The incident in Crimea is one of many cases across the globe in which employees have been found to be mining cryptocurrency at work ‚Äì and subsequently penalized.

42428705,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdbph,1522069249,Why Coinbase Won't Add New Cryptos Anytime Soon,"Supporting new crypto assets may be a ""top priority"" for Coinbase, but any such additions to its order books might not be close on the horizon.  According to Coinbase general manager Dan Romero, the San Francisco-based exchange wants to add several new cryptocurrencies in line with customer feedback, but it's treading cautiously as U.S. regulators deliberate on how they might treat certain uses of the technology.  ""The reality of the regulatory situation keeps us from going and doing that right away,"" he said.  Specifically, Romero mentioned the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is rumored to have dozens of investigations ongoing concerning initial coin offerings (ICOs) ‚Äì fundraising efforts that involve the creation of custom cryptocurrencies. While speculation is ongoing about the nature of the investigations, the regulator seems to be gathering information in an effort to make a ruling on when a crypto token is a security.  But since Coinbase is not a licensed broker, at least not yet, it cannot trade instruments that qualify as securities.  And what the firm doesn't want to deal with is adding crypto assets to its platform and then being ordered to remove them again, as several exchanges in Hong Kong had to do when crypto tokens were retroactively deemed¬†securities in February.  ‚ÄúWhen we get to a point that we know which digital currencies and assets are securities, which ones are commodities, money or currency, it would be immensely helpful,"" Romero said, adding:  ""If the regulatory environment gets clearer, I think you will see Coinbase adding many new assets to our platform.""  Questions asked  The conversation comes days after the company published two blog posts on March 16, outlining its¬†process for adding new crypto assets and how it approaches newer¬†forked and airdropped cryptocurrencies created by way of changes and splits in already active softwares.  Specifically, the two posts mention Coinbase's Digital Asset Framework, unveiled in November, which provides a checklist for helping the company decide what qualifies as a healthy cryptocurrency. The checklist includes things like governance, protection against double-spending and engineering track record.  That said, some in the industry see the decisions of the market-leading exchange as random, if not altogether dubious.  For instance, Coinbase has not embraced ethereum classic, a cryptocurrency created out of an ethereum hard fork¬†in June 2016. But it did add bitcoin cash, the cryptocurrency that hard forked off bitcoin in December in an attempt to provide an alternative.  Depending on who you ask, such choices even have an air of conspiracy to them, a sentiment that was on display last week at the MIT Bitcoin Expo.  ""Christmas, the time when the conversation around the table is crypto,"" Nick Ayton, founder of Chainstarter, a platform for launching ICOs, said on a panel addressing token sales. ""Everyone downloads the app. All of a sudden, you see bitcoin cash appear.""  He continued:  ""No announcement. There‚Äôs a lot of funny business going on.""  Indeed, the move was seen as having a partisan bent.  Firstly, while company leadership had initially been on the side of those who wanted to increase the bitcoin block size, Coinbase didn't support the asset from the outset, angering plenty of bitcoin holders on the platform, who were to receive an equivalent amount of bitcoin cash.  Then, shortly after adding support for the coin, Coinbase suddenly disabled trading of bitcoin cash, eventually announcing that massive buy demand had caused insufficient liquidity. As Coinbase worked to reinstate trading, bitcoin cash hit all-time-highs, and some pointed to insider trading, which the company said it was looking into¬†but has yet to make any determination on.  On the subject, Romero briefly commented, ""If you run bitcoin cash through the Digital Assets Framework, it passes that framework.""  'All about the customers'  The framework, though, isn't the only guide for Coinbase's decision-making on new crypto assets.  According to Romero, a committee of roughly eight people ‚Äì the committee isn't their main job ‚Äì evaluate which crypto assets to add based on customer demand (bitcoin cash was a very popular choice, for instance).  Romero wouldn't divulge many details about the committee, but he did say that there is currently no standard for collecting customer feedback and confirmed that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is not on the committee.  While Romero declined to comment on which assets are currently being considered, nevertheless, the fact that Coinbase is gauging popular demand might provide insight into what cryptocurrency assets might be next.  Coinbase currently supports bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin. But, for some time, there have been rumors about the exchange adding Ripple Inc's native cryptocurrency, XRP.  So far, Coinbase has denied all rumors related to XRP support. But the cryptocurrency has seen a whirlwind of attention since its price started rising in December ‚Äì hitting a $3.82 all-time-high, according to CoinDesk's Price Index ‚Äì and more than 26,000 people have signed a petition asking Coinbase to add the asset.  Speaking to the startup's interest in serving its customers, Romero said:  ""The top thing, assuming you‚Äôve passed the framework, is customer demand. Our customers. Not what social media wants. Not what CNBC wants. Our customers. We keep track of constant feedback from our customers.""

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,346 on Bitfinex. Meanwhile, CoinDesk's¬†Bitcoin Price Index¬†(BPI), which represents the average of BTC prices on the world's leading exchanges, is seen at $8,306 ‚Äì little changed from the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $8,380.  The cryptocurrency peeped above the $9,000 mark on March 20, according to Bitfinex data, but resistance at $9,200 has proved a tough nut to crack.¬†Meanwhile, bearish chart signals suggest a drop in prices is likely, though the 4-hour 50-MA has likely capped the downside around $8,200.  4-hour chart  The chart above shows that bitcoin has had a hard time holding on to gains above $8,943 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), and there are mixed indicators for what might happen next.  The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the descending triangle to the downside, signaling the BTC will likely see a downside break of the trading range.  On the other hand, the 50-MA has bottomed out and looks set to cut the 100-MA from below (bullish crossover). The crossover will likely happen in the next few hours if BTC moves above $8,700, thus possibly opening the doors for an upside break of the trading range.  A bullish break may not necessarily yield a sharp rally to $10,200 (target as per the measured height method), though, as bitcoin will likely face stiff resistance in the range of $9,280 to $9,470:  The descending 5-week moving average resistance is seen at $9,210.  The 200-day moving average is seen at $9,284  Double top neckline resistance (former support) stands at $9,280 (Feb. 25 low).  The 50-day moving average resistance is seen at $9,392.  The descending 10-week moving average is lined up at $9,411.  50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent drop is $9,470.  So, on the higher side, only a daily close (as per UTC) above $9,470 would allow a stronger rally to $10,200.  Meanwhile, on the downside, acceptance below $8,200 could embolden the bears and could yield a sell-off to $7,240 (March 18 low).  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, the bears remain in control ‚Äì as suggested by the bearish outside-week and negative follow-through, and the descending 5-week MA and 10-week MA. Furthermore, last week's candle has a long upper shadow, indicating a stronger potential for prices to drop.  View  BTC seems most likely to take out support at $8,200 and re-test $7,240 (recent low) this week.  The weekly chart favors a drop to $6,600 (weekly 50-MA).

Eric Jing, Ant Financial's CEO, speaking during a speech at the annual China Development Forum on March 24 in Beijing, said that¬†much of the existing blockchain enthusiasm comes from speculation around the concept of blockchain.  Jing suggested that many projects behind initial coin offerings can provide nothing but a poor white paper, and he appeared to rule out the possibility of his firm holding an ICO.  ""The current phase is like the internet bubble period in the 1990s,"" Jing said, adding, ""Ant Financial has drawn a clear line with ICOs.""  According to local media source¬†The Paper, the CEO further explained that, while he believes in blockchain's potential as a trust mechanism for the future digitalized society, the current bubble is very likely to burst in the next two to three years. Only after that will the industry be able see real blockchain applications come into place, he said.  A notable internet entrepreneur in China, Jing is a long time veteran of the Alibaba Group, having helped to grow the AliPay business, as well as its operator, Ant Financial. The latter firm made headlines last year for its¬†thwarted¬†attempt to buy U.S. payment service¬†MoneyGram.  Despite the criticism of ICOs, Alibaba has made moves into the blockchain space, taking a focus on technological development. As reported previously, Ant Financial has already developed a blockchain-powered platform for charity donations.  In his comments, Jing said that one of the main blockchain focuses for Ant Financial going forward will be to work on cross-blockchain compatibility.  Furthermore, according to¬†data disclosed by China's State Intellectual Property Office, Alibaba Group has now filed around 50 blockchain-related patent applications, which are pending approval.

42428746,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdcBh,1522051235,Crypto Kill Switch: Monero Goes to War Against Miners,"Developers are preparing to go to lengths to keep one of the world's largest cryptocurrencies free from the encroaching interests of big business.  While a high-speed hardware known as an ASIC has been used to secure bitcoin transactions for years, mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain recently announced a new model, the Antminer X3, that has been purpose-built for mining the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency monero.  Yet rather than greeting the hardware as a welcome sign of increased interest, monero will go so far as to enact an emergency software upgrade in April meant specifically to change the rules of the system so as to block the effort entirely.  Largely referred to as monero's first move in a ""war"" against ASICs, the upcoming software upgrade will render the Antminer X3 ineffective. Not only that but to keep hardware manufacturers from catching up, these algorithm edits are planned to continue with bi-annual networks upgrades.  Stepping back, the move is a defense of the mining made possible by monero's current algorithm, Cryptonight, which can successfully mine monero on consumer-grade laptops. Faced with competition by highly efficient ASICs, the fear is affordable laptop mining would be silenced.  And that's not a development developers are taking lightly.  ""I will do everything in my power to help the community prevent the proliferation of centralization-inducing ASICs on the monero network,"" core developer Riccardo ""Fluffypony"" Spagni declared on GitHub.  Currently issued by a sole supplier, Bitmain, concerns exist that the Antminer X3 could lead to certain kinds of attacks, namely ones in which a mining pool takes over the majority of a cryptocurrency's hashrate, creating false transaction histories, double spending coins and censoring payments.  And while there‚Äôs debate that highly efficient ASICs are, by and large, good for security, many in the¬†monero community are standing in opposition.  ‚ÄúIf you're worried about an attack from, say, someone using lots of Amazon servers to 51 percent the coin, then forking away from ASICs is a bad move,‚Äù core developer ""moneromooo"" told CoinDesk.  The developer continued:  ‚ÄùIf you're worried about an attack from someone like Bitmain, then not forking away from ASICs means you're already pwned, since Bitmain will likely have 51 percent very, very soon.‚Äù  Bitmain doubts  Influencing the decision is, of course, the long-standing distrust between developers and Bitmain (as well as its co-CEO and principal figurehead¬†Jihan Wu).  Last year, concerns were raised that Bitmain was secretly exploiting a weakness in bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm, through a process called¬†ASICBoost, which supposedly enabled its three mining pools to mine roughly 20 percent faster than competitors.¬†Not long after this controversy came the discovery of a mining chip vulnerability called Antbleed, which some believed Bitmain had implanted purposefully so it could forcibly shut down any of its miners at will.  Then, late last year, Bitmain produced an ASIC that was capable of mining siacoin, a small cryptocurrency, in a move that was widely regarded as a takeover.  All these things allowed Spagni to defend his cryptocurrency's ASIC-resistance on Twitter, writing, ‚ÄúTheir actions with the bitcoin community and more recently the sia community are clearly those of a bad actor.""  But even without the concerns about Wu and Bitmain, enabling ASICs to be used to mine monero could potentially pose a bigger risk, since censorship-resistance is so key to its success, monero core developer ‚ÄúbinaryFate‚Äù explained.  ‚ÄúMaybe even more so than for other cryptocurrencies, decentralization is key to monero for ensuring censorship resistance,‚Äù binaryFate said.  For instance,¬†censorship would destroy a key promise of the private cryptocurrency ‚Äì fungibility, or the ability to use one coin just as any other.  In an announcement, the monero team extrapolated on the risks of ASIC centralization, writing that until ASIC hardware is widespread, it is of high-security risk, including the potential of government bribery or even the introduction of a ‚Äúkill switch‚Äù that could shut down miners remotely.  The blog post states:  ‚ÄúThis threat has the potential to destroy the whole network.‚Äù  Critics of Cryptonight  As such, monero will continue to fight against the hardware.  ‚ÄúI believe this has set a precedent that we are serious about ASIC resistance, can react quickly if we are forced to and do not mind manufacturers losing money,"" binaryFate said.¬†‚ÄúIn the foreseeable future, I doubt any ASIC manufacturer will want to give a try at monero again.‚Äù  However, the move has shown to be divisive as well, primarily because monero's proof-of-work algorithm is not without its critics. While it‚Äôs key to the cryptocurrency's accessibility, others feel that the low barrier to entry lowers the cost of attack.  For one, a javascript implementation of the protocol, named Coinhive, was labelled the sixth most popular malware worldwide in a study by cybersecurity firm Check Point¬†last November. Further, in February this year, the algorithm enacted botnet attacks to the scale of over half a million mining machines.  ‚ÄúIn which a small-cap cryptocurrency desperately tries to destroy their security by fighting actively against economies of scale,‚Äù Philip Daian, an ethereum researcher, wrote on Twitter, about the community's moves to stop ASICs.  Echoing a similar sentiment, Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician at Blockstream, argued in a 2015 research paper¬†that while¬†anti-ASIC code can delay manufacturers, ‚Äúultimately ASIC resistance is futile.‚Äù  Plus, there are concerns that ongoing edits¬†to the underlying algorithm could weaken the code, opening doors to vulnerabilities. Addressing this, developer ‚Äúiamsmooth‚Äù suggested an ‚ÄúASIC-friendly‚Äù approach, that would focus on lowering the cost and accessibility of the hardware.  In conversation with CoinDesk, even¬†moneromooo agreed, stating that bi-annual edits ‚Äúis a bit of a shitty method, so hopefully, a better algorithm can be found.‚Äù  But until then, Spagni and many others defend monero's actions.  ""This is a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils,"" Spagni wrote on Github, weighing botnets against ASICs.  And ultimately, Spagni took to¬†Twitter to say: ‚ÄúIt might entirely be less secure, but the community has made the hard call.""  He continued:  ""I don't decide anything, the community does.""

42428706,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdbrh,1522036848,The Right Way to Think About Crypto Tokens,"Consumers might be the biggest winners when crypto tokens are designed correctly.  At least that's the case made by a new paper by MIT's Christian Catalini and the University of Toronto's Joshua Gans, which describes a simplified model that illustrates what might be a valuable price discovery role that utility tokens, or those that operate as true commodities in the spirit of bitcoin and ether, might enable.  Not only that but the paper, called ""Initial Coin Offerings and the Value of Crypto Tokens,"" goes so far as to predict a world where tokens empower consumers to choose an optimal price for a service collectively.  From the introduction:  ""This paper provides the first economic analysis of the ICO funding mechanism and how it relates to traditional equity financing.""  It goes on to tease out intriguing benefits that might accrue to society through the sale of and trade in utility tokens, one of the most controversial topics in crypto today, suggesting that risks could be balanced by returns if entrepreneurs are permitted to try the token fundraising model so the public can see how it plays out.  Most people looking at the initial coin offering (ICO) trend see extraordinary sums of money coming in ‚Äî $8.84 billion as of February, according to the CoinDesk ICO tracker, and no doubt that's why U.S. regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have raised so many questions about this new industry.  ""The problem the regulators have is they don't know what the goals are,"" Gans told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""Instead the regulators are coming in saying 'I don't really know how the market should be working, but it smells terrible.'""  What tokens do  In this way, the paper was meant to begin a conversation about the right way to think about tokens so that societies could rationally consider the correct approach to managing them.  ""You have to create the economic theory to understand what's going on here to even know what category of regulation to choose,"" Gans said.  ""The ICO mechanism allows entrepreneurs to generate buyer competition for the token, which, in turn, reveals consumer value without the entrepreneurs having to know, ex ante [based on forecasts], consumer willingness to pay,"" the paper argues.  Gans said:  ""We were trying, with our paper, to ask why would these tokens be of any value.""  The paper plays out a simple model of a company offering a token as the sole means of paying for some new technology platform (like a video site or malware detector), with a founder who has no intention of cheating or bending on commitments. The idea is that the issuer can have some idea of how much it would cost to build whatever it wants to build, but the firm can't reliably know how the public will price it.  The hard thing about technology projects is that they often have very high upfront costs to write the code, test it and get it working (fixed costs). On the other hand, once it's built, each new user usually doesn't cost the company much (the marginal cost).  Gans believes that entrepreneurs are thinking about costs a lot more than demand when they run token sales.  ""The real value of the tokens has really nothing to do with the amount of money you want to spend, but with how much money people want to spend with you,"" Gans said.  That said, Gans argued that it didn't matter if a token project gets specific early on about pricing new services in terms of its token. For example, if Netflix launched today with an ICO, it might say in its white paper that one NFLX token would be good for one month of streaming video.  That level of specificity isn't necessary before a project gets started, Gans said, but it might help if the company spelled out some of its thinking about how many users it might get over time and what factors might influence it growing or declining.  Such projections would give the market more insight to price the products accurately before they launch, including future gains.  ""Maybe people who are doing these white papers could provide a more clear path to whatever they are doing,"" Gans said.  On the other hand, he added:  ""I don't think for a moment that anyone who's buying these tokens has worked all that out.""  Founders mustn't  One caveat: it only works if founders don't cheat, and there are two key cheats that consumers and speculators both need to worry about.  Acknowledging the fact that no one has had a chance to see an ICO roll from a token sale to launch and product-market fit, theoretically, this basic model works fine, assuming a good faith founder. Of course, the biggest danger is a founder who presents a compelling vision, runs a token scale and absconds with the earnings.  And here Gans welcomes the present scrutiny by regulators. He said, ""Their instinct to stop people making false promises is of course correct.""  But what if the issuer breaks the commitment to only accept the token as payment on the platform. If they did that, the price of tokens has the potential to completely collapse.  For another, the issuer could also just issue more tokens. Then all the tokens in the world would drop proportionally in value.  Most issuers hold tokens, supposedly to align their interests with their users, but this is really no protection because the issuer will still come out ahead issuing new tokens, even if their reserve loses value. As Gans said, this is why some countries get into out of control inflation situations, because every time a treasury prints more money, the state comes out ahead (until it all completely unravels).  That said, this danger is only contingent on projects that announce a fixed supply of tokens that will never change again after the token generation event (as most ICO projects do today).  ""What if during that growth cycle you realize you don't have enough money and you need more?"" Gans asked. ""You're going to be a bit stuck.""  He added:  ""I wonder if they are tying their hands way too much?""  While Gans and Catalini identify these sorts of dangers, their paper doesn't suggest solutions. The idea here is to begin laying out this basic model to facilitate further research and discussion.  ""This is a very simplified model,"" Gans said of their paper. ""I don't know how everything's going to work out.""

42401356,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbQaE,1522027850,The Sierra Leone Vote: What We Got Wrong,"Blockchain technology may have the potential to change in the world, but exaggerating its real-world accomplishments can only sow public distrust and set the industry back.  The recent confusion and controversy over the role of Agora, a blockchain startup, in the Sierra Leone presidential election serve as a case in point.  While an Agora executive has taken responsibility for media coverage that overstated its involvement, CoinDesk inadvertently contributed in our initial story, which revealed the news to the world for the first time on March 8.  First, the facts: Agora acted as an international observer in the Sierra Leone election, and it was accredited for this role by the African nation‚Äôs National Electoral Commission (NEC). Importantly, Agora did not do the official vote count; that was the NEC‚Äôs job.  Rather, it provided an independent count of ballots that the official results could be compared against, and only for the Western district of Sierra Leone, not the whole country. Agora workers on the ground manually recorded its tally on a private blockchain.  That in itself was a first for the technology and a worthy story to report. But many media outlets made it sound like Agora was running the actual election for the government on a blockchain. Unfortunately, CoinDesk was among them.  The original title for our March 8 story, ‚ÄúSierra Leone Secretly Holds First Blockchain-Powered Presidential Vote,‚Äù while vague, could easily have given readers the wrong idea (the adjective was later changed to ‚ÄúBlockchain-Audited‚Äù).  Further, the article as initially posted did not note that Agora‚Äôs work was confined to the Western district (a detail added after publication), nor did it explicitly spell out the company‚Äôs limited role as an observer, again potentially misleading readers.  It should be noted that CoinDesk did attempt to reach the NEC for comment for that story, but did not hear back by deadline. An additional request has also gone unanswered. And our follow-up article, published on March 10, was much clearer about the scope of Agora‚Äôs activities.  Nevertheless, the early coverage across the media has led to ‚Äúfake news‚Äù recriminations (mostly directed at Agora) and generally left a bad taste.  The NEC itself, in a March 19 tweet, flatly stated that it ‚Äúdoes not use blockchain in any way.‚Äù    pic.twitter.com/8cLMVvQPkQ        ‚Äî National Electoral Commission of Sierra Leone (@NECsalone) March 19, 2018      Jaron Lukasiewicz, Agora‚Äôs chief operating officer and the main source in our March 8 article, issued a mea culpa, telling CoinDesk:  ‚ÄúI would like to acknowledge that any misunderstandings in the media are my own responsibility, though they were unintentional. I am implementing new processes for future media events covering Agora.‚Äù  And when interviewed by reporter Michael del Castillo for that first article, Lukasiewicz indeed spoke imprecisely, and perhaps with a bit of hyperbole, saying things such as this:  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking at a country that you probably wouldn‚Äôt normally expect to be the first to use transparent voting tech. But a country like Sierra Leone can ultimately minimize a lot of the fall-out of a highly contentious election by using software like this.‚Äù  Nevertheless, we recognize that the ambiguity in the March 8 article likely contributed to the confusion and should have chosen our words more carefully.  CoinDesk continues to strive for the highest journalistic standards, and to raise the bar for integrity, accuracy and clarity in our reporting.
